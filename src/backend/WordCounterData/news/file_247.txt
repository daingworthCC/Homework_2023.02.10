3045641 <p> Guns : Tougher laws will reduce toll <p> The number of violent crimes that have been committed with guns found in homes with young children and teenagers, coupled with the accidental deaths resulting from carelessly stored guns, is horrifying( " School official killed, 2 hurt in shooting, " News, Nov. 9). <p> It is critical that we not only strictly enforce existing gun laws but also enact new ones to protect ourselves and our children. The number of deaths and injuries sustained in the United States attributed to guns found in homes can be drastically reduced if we create restrictive laws. How many more people will die before we realize this? <p> TONI EDELSON <p> Edelson, of Marietta, is a senior at Walton High School. <p> Users, not products, deserve the blame <p> Why not include alcohol, tobacco, junk food, pornography and rap music( " Guns are too accessible to teens, " Editorial, Nov. 11)? Any and all of these products can contribute to behavior that is harmful to the individual and society. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teenager, but I did n't suffer from a psychological disorder that caused me to behave in a manner that caused the destruction of human lives. <p> Stop blaming the gun and seek out the true causes of aberrant behavior. <p> TONY CRESCIMANNO, Peachtree City <p> ' The ATL ' : Responses to " Brand new day, " Page One, Nov. 11 <p> Slap at 60-year-olds <p> Shame on Mayor Shirley Franklin for dissing us 60-year-olds. <p> Folks our age or older built the Silver Comet bicycle trail, gave Atlanta its aquarium, poured money into the new High Museum, fought for sidewalks and schools -- and support Franklin 's mature leadership. <p> Without us, there would be nothing for younger people to sing about. Besides, many of us can run faster, play harder and even sing better than them. <p> MAXINE ROCK, Atlanta <p> P.C. brand stinks <p> Thanks, Atlanta, for the new slogan and anthem. It will surely create business opportunities and jobs -- for Nashville. <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this politically correct branding. Who 's in charge down there now? <p> If the purpose was to attract business, why not say so in the slogan? " Atlanta : Business is on our mind. " It 's not the greatest, but I would not have to explain it. And the anthem -- " the music brings me to my knees. " Is hip-hop the only business Atlanta wants? <p> BRANDT DOOLEY, Lebanon, Tenn. <p> Chance to shine goes down drain <p> Like the Braves and Falcons during the playoffs, why is it that a city that aspires to world-class, international status usually flops when the opportunity is presented to hit a winning home run or score the big touchdown? <p> The new slogan is lame, I do n't know anyone who refers to Atlanta as " the ATL " and the song is plumb awful. I ca n't understand a word. I hope the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra 's version is better, and that if it is, that will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relocate a business or hold a convention, I might go elsewhere. Why was n't a collaborative effort made by Dallas Austin, Elton John and other well-known Atlanta recording artists to come up with something better? <p> Then again, maybe I am a 60-year-old, like the mayor -- but one who happens to be walking around in a 31-year-old body. <p> DAVID J. STEWART, Smyrna <p> Environmentalists sway drilling vote <p> Displaying as much backbone as a snail, the U.S. House of Representatives has again shown its disdain for the country 's well-being( " House leaders drop Arctic drilling proposal from budget, " News, Nov. 10). Caving in to radical environmentalists, the House removed from the budget bill the provision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, leaving this country still dependent on foreign sources for crude oil. <p> We should be drilling in ANWR, and offshore as well. The technology is there for oil companies to drill with minimum environmental impact. If the government will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say turn them loose and let them drill. I also say that it is high time we take a close look at those in the Congress who fail to provide legislation that is in the best interest of all the people. <p> RALEIGH CANNON, Roswell <p> Wanted : Politician with a backbone <p> Forget Democrats and Republicans -- give me a politician who will stand up for what he believes, regardless of party affiliation( " To advance, Democrats need solutions, " @issue, Nov. 11). <p> I want a politician who will make decisions based upon his or her beliefs and character. Where is a politician who will fight for our Constitution, a politician with a backbone, one who, right or wrong, will make a decision and stand by it? Do n't give me a canned speech written by some aide, or any more focus group garbage. <p> This country needs leaders, not spineless politicians who can not vote until they see what a poll says or what some special-interest group wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years does n't mean it 's right. Give me an honest, no-baloney leader. <p> GEOFF RESNIK, Acworth <p> Wooten 's position does n't have a prayer <p> I do n't know what it is with Jim Wooten and the American Civil Liberties Union 's Cobb County lawsuit( " Thinking Right, " Nov. 11). He 's like a dog worrying about an old bone. <p> I truly do n't understand how he can justify defending the indefensible. It 's really simple : Why should I have to listen to prayers in order to participate in government business? <p> Wooten wants to litigate and force the loser to pay. I say fine -- only it 's the county that will have wasted taxpayers ' money when it has to pay for the ACLU 's court costs. <p> KEN COHEN, Roswell <p> Government fails to provide relief <p> Thanks for putting the article on disaster relief where more Republicans are likely to read it( " Disaster help ignored by feds, " Business, Nov. 11) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time. We all need government help in a crisis. <p> Yes, some of the federal failure to accept free water or direct free flights to needed areas can be blamed on bureaucracy. But much of it can be traced to the Bush administration 's lack of concern for the little people and their diligent efforts to gut or sabotage those agencies designed to protect us and care for those who ca n't care for themselves. <p> JOHN HOLLENDER, Atlanta <p> Evolutionary theory passes the test <p> Pat Robertson needs to learn that wrapping oneself in a flag and holding a Bible makes you neither patriotic nor Christian( " Televangelist warns Pennsylvania town, " News, Nov. 11). Saying stupid and cruel things to people who do n't agree with his intolerant dogma is, well, stupid and cruel. <p> Regarding his bile concerning the Dover, Pa., school board : Evolutionary theory, the framework tying together all of biology, explains similarities and differences between organisms, fossils, biogeography, drug resistance, relative virulence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors are more often than not a product of the study of evolution. <p> Diseases such as cystic fibrosis are proof of evolution. How? Having one copy of the cystic fibrosis gene makes that person highly tolerant of deadly cholera, much as having one copy of sickle cell anemia makes that individual tolerant of malaria. <p> A change in genetic material that resulted in a change in a population is but one of the many facets that make up evolution. In science, we call this balanced polymorphism -- not punishment for ousting school board members who favor teaching intelligent design. <p> DAVID ROBINSON <p> Robinson, of Norcross, is an anthropologist and medical researcher.
