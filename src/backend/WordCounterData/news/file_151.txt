3031241 <p> Anne Mulcahy took over as Xerox CEO in August 2001 when the company was $ 17 billion in debt, losing market share and in the middle of an accounting scandal that spread north from its unit in Mexico. Xerox stock price fell 93% from 1999 to 2002. Throughout, Mulcahy insisted that bankruptcy was not an option. Xerox paid $ 10 million to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cut its workforce by one-third, yet maintained spending on research and development. In 2002, Xerox 's 700 patents put it among the top 10 companies. Its stock, though still about one-sixth of its peak price, has more than doubled from its 2002 lows to more than $ 10 a share. In an interview with USA TODAY corporate management reporter Del Jones, Mulcahy, 51, talked about how she focused the company on its future even while trying to save it from short-term disaster. She looked years down the road as analysts wondered whether Xerox might not survive from one quarter to the next. <p> Q : Is Xerox back from the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been gaining market share from the competition. There has n't been a lot of growth in the industry, so the only growth is winning against competitors. You do n't choose to find yourself in a crisis, but moving quickly and being decisive are really important. People do n't have unending patience. Xerox is an incredible brand, but you ca n't capture people 's hearts and minds with restructuring for endless amounts of time. <p> Q : When in trouble, what are the priorities? <p> A : Customers and employees come first. They need to see the company moving quickly in the right direction. You make commitments, execute against them and build credibility. We made sure we did not disappoint. That does n't allow you to sit back and coast. It 's been a very intense time at Xerox. <p> Q : Are you forgetting shareholders? <p> A : It used to be that you would deliver very different messages, but these days the world really is transparent and the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is similar to the reasons why investors invest and customers choose to do business with you. You convince everyone that you 're competitive and best in class and a leader in the marketplace again. <p> Q : Companies in trouble cut expenses and clean up the balance sheet. How do you reinvent yourself at the same time? <p> A : While taking out $ 2 billion from our cost base, we retained all of our research and development expenses of 5% to 6% of revenue. The company was focused on the future, and we made tough decisions to invest in areas that would enable Xerox to grow. You do n't get to be a great company again only by cutting costs. In the last six quarters, we 've introduced something like 27 new products. We 've completely refreshed our whole portfolio. <p> Q : How did you arrive at 5% to 6% for R &D; spending? Why not 4% to slash more debt? <p> A : There 's a lot of benchmarking done. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more because our partner Fuji Xerox spends another half a billion dollars on research and development that we take advantage of. <p> Q : If 5% to 6% proved so worthwhile, why not spend 7% or 8% on R &D?; <p> A : If you were going to bump up spending that much, it would be more about extending your reach into new markets. For the markets we serve, 5% to 6% is sufficient. It 's not so much what you 're spending, but how you 're spending it. Efficient spending is as important as actual dollars. <p> Q : Xerox is known for inventing the personal computer but not cashing in on that invention. How do companies avoid throwing winning ideas on the junk pile? And how do they keep from having a lot of cool ideas that will never be moneymakers? <p> A : Research by nature does not create specific products. It tends to be more broad-based and often results in ideas that are best used outside the traditional business. We take as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology when it 's not a great fit. That 's important if you 're going to invest in research. <p> Q : Customers seem to be tiring of technological breakthroughs that force them to spend money upgrading. <p> A : They no longer want irrelevant products. They no longer want bells and whistles. They will no longer pay for anything they do n't consider to be extremely valuable. You 've got to demonstrate that it saves time or money. We 've gone to a modular approach so customers get only what they want. Last April, we unbundled a lot of digital products so that small customers could buy something stripped down. Our share has skyrocketed in that part of the marketplace. <p> Q : Kodak has been criticized for not responding fast enough to the digital world. When Xerox saw this fundamental change coming, how did it know when to make it? <p> A : I 'd like to take credit for the decision to move to digital, but it was my predecessors who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision. There are cost implications and change implications. Quite frankly, it 's painful. But it only gets more painful as time goes on. All of our businesses and investments are digital. <p> Q : Did Xerox switch to digital too soon? <p> A : Analog technology was more profitable and generated more cash because it required less development and investment. It 's difficult to say when it 's too early, but I 'd rather make an error on the side of being too early than being too late. Our analog business funded our digital transition. You have to make sure that your funding business is healthy and alive and has a long runway so it can fund the transition to the next technology. <p> If you wait too long, that 's when it gets really, really ugly. The best is when those are balanced, so you have a healthy, profitable, cash-intensive business that can help you fund those new investments that will be the future. <p> Q : Xerox has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out of the soft-drink business. You 've been with Xerox 27 years. How do you keep emotional attachment from interfering with such decisions? <p> A : You 're right. I 've been here forever, and it does create an emotional attachment. I do n't think about it as getting out of the copy business. <p> The vast majority of our revenues today are in printing and multifunction with very little left in copying. We 're still in the document space, and I think it 's as much about electronic digital documents as it is about paper documents. You have expertise and core competencies that give you grounding, but you have to stay adaptive. <p> Tips from Mulcahy <p> * When in trouble, move decisively. Patience for struggling companies is thin. <p> * Investors, employees and customers all want to hear the same thing. They want to know that you 're competitive. <p> * When cutting costs, do n't forget the future. <p> * It 's not just how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. <p> * License ideas that do n't fit the core business. <p> * Forget bells and whistles if they do n't save customers ' time or money. <p> * It 's hard to know exactly when change is needed, but better early than late. <p> About Anne Mulcahy <p> * Bachelor 's in English/journalism from Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., 1974. <p> * Mulcahy is married with two sons.
