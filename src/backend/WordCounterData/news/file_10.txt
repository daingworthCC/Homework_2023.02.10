3001541 <p> Carol Lampkin was a chatty woman with a sweeping smile who needed a lot of medical attention. And she did not want it from anyone but Dr. Jennifer James. <p> Ms. Lampkin 's principal complaint was reflex sympathetic dystrophy -- pain without underlying cause, the sort of phantom limb pain amputees sometimes suffer. She had broken her neck in a motorcycle accident when she was 23, but it did not affect her until she was 47, and since then she had had several surgeries. Now, at 53, she felt numbness along her right cheek down to her first two toes. " I feel a burning sensation and a tingling, " she said. " I feel like I 've been electrocuted. " <p> She used a walker or a cane. Among other ailments, she suffered from hypertension. She had had a civilian desk job with the New York City Police Department, but work was now out of the question. <p> Dr. James saw her in the outpatient clinic during her first month of internship, and she had been back repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. Inside her clinic exam room at St. Luke 's Hospital, Ms. Lampkin glowed. For a while, she appeared two or three times a month ; now she came every three to four weeks. Sometimes, her pain got so bad that she had to be admitted to the hospital. She would call to inform Dr. James, and Dr. James would make a point of dropping in to see her. <p> " What attracted me to her was she was nice and courteous, " Ms. Lampkin said. " She takes the time to listen. It 's not easy to get that, because when you 're in the clinic they take your blood pressure, talk to you for a minute and you 're gone. She wanted to know about me. And if she does n't know something, she does n't make it up. She goes and reads up on it. " <p> In her fidelity, Ms. Lampkin represented what the teachers meant when they talked about " continuity of care " -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caring for Ms. Lampkin was what Dr. James had in mind way back in July, when she had said, " What a doctor is is being compassionate and just being there for people. " Most of the time, especially with all the pressures brought on by managed care, the hospital moved too erratically, too fast. Here in the spring of her internship, though, it was that kind of bond that made Dr. James feel happiest about medicine. <p> She thought fondly of another clinic patient : The first time she saw him, she threw him out. He told her he had once worked for the C.I.A. and now sold books on the street and fought unknown demons. He drank 24 to 36 beers a day and smoked heavily. He was drunk. He got abusive. But he returned another week, behaved properly, and Dr. James accepted him as a challenge. He had suffered a stroke but refused necessary surgery. She coaxed him into it. Afterward, he told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've almost gotten him to stop smoking, " she said, " and we talk about stopping drinking. I think I 'm getting closer. With him, I feel I really did something. I was a doctor. " <p> She brought in her next patient. He was new, a little turned-inward, a little bellicose. He believed he had sprained his ankle on a crack in the sidewalk. He said the emergency room had told him he needed new shoes, not medical care. He walked a lot. He was homeless. He wanted an X-ray. She said that was unnecessary. His ankles were swollen. She told him that meant something might be going on with his heart ; she wanted other tests done. <p> He said no and no and no. He was loud and brassy. " You must think I 'm stupid, " he said. " You do n't want to spend the money on an X-ray. If you do n't want to treat me right, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said no. Exasperated, she brought in her supervisor. She watched as he knelt down and listened patiently to the man, gave credence to his opinion but nudged him toward Dr. James 's. The man capitulated. She wondered if it was because the attending was older and happened to be a man. <p> She did not let that bother her. Her next two patients failed to show up. She had time. The man 's shoes were too small and tattered. She asked him if he wanted to go to the volunteer department, where donated clothing awaited. She and her husband both gave clothing there. She thought his feet looked the same size as her husband 's. <p> Together, they sifted through bins of used shoes. She dug out a pair of 11 1/2 sneakers. He slipped them on. " These feel real good, " he said. A smile blossomed. " Thank you, doctor, " he told her. Out in the real world, when would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoes? She did not think of it that way, just that a connection had been made. " That was cool, " she said. " It felt really cool to do that. " A Step Off the Treadmill <p> Time sped by in the final months, more of a blur. The fatigue, though, persisted. Even during vacation, Dr. Bryan Holland slept poorly. His body was used to no sleep. He had deliberately stopped watching " E.R., " the staple of doctors in training. It felt like a continuation of work. His parents had given him a keyboard for Christmas, and he unwound by playing it, mostly Mozart and some Beethoven. He had been reading Robert Frost. <p> He worked relentlessly. He found that he was really obsessive, always wanting everything done just so, and he knew he was probably going to drive the interns he supervised next year crazy. He had no patience for interns who complained endlessly about how taxing the work was. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, " he said at dinner one night. " They should feel blessed that they 're in the position. " <p> One day he had a treat -- a glimpse of life beyond residency. He spent the afternoon at the private office of Dr. Steven Wolf, director of the pediatric neurology clinic. <p> He saw a succession of cases of attention deficit disorder. <p> A young boy with a wild tassel of hair came in, compulsively talkative. He could not sit still for a moment. Dr. Holland asked him what he watched on TV. <p> " I watch every cartoon that has green, brown or red or gray or blue. The cartoons in black and white, I do n't think they 're so funny. Did you know the ' I Love Lucy Show ' used to be called the ' I Ca n't Stand Ethel Show? ' " <p> His mother said he had a lot of anger inside him. He fought constantly with his brother. The boy then interrupted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull their hair. " He even likes electrocuting the kids, " he said. <p> Dr. Wolf came in. He asked Dr. Holland to describe the movements he saw. <p> " They do n't seem like tics, " Dr. Holland said. " They seem voluntary. " <p> Dr. Wolf said, " Right. Just a fidgety kid with ants in his pants. " <p> Then he said, " So Dr. Holland, would you classify him as attention deficit disorder? Dangerous word. " <p> Dr. Holland : " He 's borderline, but I would n't classify him as that as yet. " <p> Dr. Wolf : " So he has symptoms of it. " <p> Then Dr. Wolf told the mother : " What I 'd like to do is gather more information. I 'm going to give you a teacher evaluation form for the school so we can get more information. " <p> The boy said, " To gather more information about my family, please contact Dumb brother.com. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever kid. " <p> Dr. Holland liked being in a real office. It was far less chaotic than the clinic, with more involved parents with better insurance than the Medicaid patients he usually saw. To a young doctor learning the subtle arts of diagnosis, it was a welcome step off the clinic treadmill. <p> He admired Dr. Wolf 's style. But he also saw the unmistakable pressures. With night pressing in, Dr. Wolf 's staff had gone home. He continued seeing patients, never failing to ask for every $10 and $15 co-payment. Insurance cutbacks were killing him, he said. His revenues dropped year by year. Having interns do some office shifts was one way to prop up the economics. He did other things now, like expert testimony in court cases and patient studies for drug companies. <p> Increasingly, Dr. Holland came to understand that he was treating not just a child, but also the often incoherent effects of an environment full of perils and mysteries. " I 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother, " he said. " I notice now when mothers are calm when they bring in a sick child. Why is n't that mother agitated? What comes to mind is, the mother is not attentive. " <p> He very much appreciated that it was strange times. Working the ward on his final rotation, he was stupefied by a 14-year-old girl who said that she had already had 68 sexual partners. When a week later, a 17-year-old said that she had had 13 partners, no one blinked. <p> And then Dr. Holland was taking a history from a mother of a 4-year-old boy. He got to the section about relatives. The mother said the boy 's sister had been shot to death two days ago. Dr. Holland went numb. He looked at his sheet. The next part dealt with form of payment. He could not bring himself to ask. He left it blank. The hospital would have to figure that out. A Style of One 's Own <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus of voices : <p> " I think my head 's going to explode. " <p> " I 'm going to discharge Mr. Crazy now. " <p> " Is there really someone in 1B with a heart rate of 24? " <p> Dr. Edward Lathan worked with focus. Steadily, he felt he was cultivating that sixth sense that told a doctor who was really sick and who was not. Now, he addressed an elderly man. <p> " Why are you in the hospital? " <p> " Because my people called the ambulance. " <p> " Why did they call the ambulance? " <p> " Because I laid down on the floor. " <p> " Why did you lay down on the floor? " <p> " I do n't know. " <p> He was refining a style. He had watched one high-strung senior doctor who, not getting the answers he wanted from a patient, would squeeze his gloved hands together until you could hear the squishing noise. Dr. Lathan vowed never to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm, or, if it 's appropriate, brush some hair out of their face, to show I 'm caring, " he said. " It 's my own little technique. " <p> It seemed beyond imagination how many patients he had treated. Some still haunted him, like the 21-year-old lifeguard who, while practicing holding his breath under water, passed out, threw up and gagged. He came in without a heartbeat and could not be revived. " He was so young, " Dr. Lathan said. " He was about to touch his dreams. I had been a lifeguard. " <p> From the start, he had felt a special kinship with the destitute who gravitated to the E.R., and he still tried to look out for them. But he was less tolerant of those who took advantage of him, for there had been so many. He had a woman with leg ulcers, and when he tried to wrap her legs, she declared every action wrong. In exasperation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap her own legs. When she was done, she hung around for a free breakfast. <p> He had learned that it was all right to hate patients who were difficult or obnoxious, as long as you still took care of them. Granted, you got irritated when someone got a fever at 5 A.M. or pulled out an I.V. during your only nap, but you still went ahead and did what needed doing. <p> " When someone is sick, I do n't have the right to be nasty to him, " explained Dr. Michael Lesch, the head of the medicine department. <p> Dr. Lesch liked to tell a story from his own internship : A fireman brought in five children with severe burns. Their father had got angry at the mother and set the house on fire. The father sat in the next room with burns on his skin. Dr. Lesch had to go in and treat him. " We see some bad people, " he told the interns. " We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with multiple stab wounds. His girlfriend had sliced him up. She had some minor bruises herself. She was a vile person, cursing and spitting at everyone. " She was someone you wanted to hate, " Dr. Lathan said. Nevertheless, he was prepared to treat her, but someone else had taken her. ' I Have Become More Detached ' <p> What? Statues had metamorphosed into actual people and were marching across the adjacent roof? Alert the newspapers right away? <p> So the patient insisted. She was in her 70 's, chirpy, with steel-gray hair, awaiting heart surgery. She was taking steroids for swelling in her legs. They sometimes triggered hallucinations. Dr. James was peremptory, assuring her the statues were inanimate.( It could be worse. On another floor, a man complained that a helicopter hovered in his room.) <p> As she neared the July 1 state of bliss known as the end of internship, Dr. James found that the surprises still came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with them. As the golden light of morning poured through the hospital windows, Dr. James traversed her world with brisk assurance. Many things that were once challenges had become perfunctory. There was a momentum of familiarity in the days. <p> When she began her internship, Dr. James had been tentative and submissive, beset by qualms about what the year would bring. Now, she felt she could manage even the most sadistic senior doctors. " I decide they have some psychological problem themselves, " she said. If someone picked on her, she could push right back. One day she was reading a chart when a nurse 's note stopped her cold : " Unable to draw my labs. Paged Dr. James at 7 A.M. and got no response. " Dr. James returned fire. She wrote on the chart : " In response to above comment, I was in the hospital promptly at 7 A.M. and received no pages. " <p> She did still encounter jitters when a complex patient arrived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with multiple problems, she ordered every test she could think of -- " the works, " she called it -- so she would n't miss anything. <p> But she was far less convinced that she would miss things. She saw an AIDS patient and took care of some treatment orders. " See, I 'm getting more resident efficient, " she said. " I saw the patient and I 'm putting in the orders and I have n't called the resident. " <p> She took much less time with new admissions.( " The first week, it would take me at least two hours. Now if I 'm in a real hurry to catch the bus and it 's uncomplicated, I could do it in a half-hour. ") Her diagnostic abilities had sharpened. She was more confident doing procedures. She could take notes and write a prescription and listen to a patient talk about what a jerk her son-in-law was all at the same time. She could go on and on. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float " -- instituted a few years ago in an effort to keep interns ' hours under new limits -- when Dr. James covered for all the other interns on the wards from 10:30 P.M. to 8 A.M. One night, she had 161 patients, most of them, fortunately, asleep. She had to do a bunch of I.V. ' s and blood draws. She had to sign an incident report for someone who had " eloped " -- simply walked off the ward. But she was unfazed. <p> With patients exiting the wards so much faster, she recognized that it was harder to get a sense of the progress of disease through the human body. She tried to compensate by mustering a composite patient from different patients at different stages of sickness. How well that worked, it was hard to tell. <p> Necessarily, she had hardened. " There 's illness and disease in the world, and some people get them and my job is to help those people and make it the best I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have this reaction of sadness for them and why they have it. I have become more detached. When I watch TV with my husband and there 's someone on who is paralyzed, he says, ' That is really sad. ' I do n't feel that way. I think it 's something that happens. " <p> She was increasingly comfortable with herself. One day, late in her shift with nothing going on, she ventured across the street and had her nails done. " I had my beeper, " she said. " If anything came up, I 'd be right there. " ' Managed Care Is an Enemy ' <p> The final weeks, there were parties and luncheons. Groups gathered for after-hours drinks. " Liver rounds, " the interns called them. <p> As a matter of course, there were year-end evaluations. Drs. James, Lathan and Holland all received quite positive feedback. A colleague went in for his, on the heels of several brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " average. " He was crestfallen and angry. He was weary to the bone and he was just average! He told some of the others he might quit. <p> Around the hospital, those completing their residencies pondered the outside world, weighing dollars against geography. Over a sandwich in the staff room, a senior resident told Dr. James : " Doctors can make $50,000 to $60,000 more a year outside of New York, because there are n't enough doctors there. But doctors want to work in the city. " He, too, wished to risk becoming part of the local doctor glut. <p> " The young doctors I know in the city are starving, " he said. When he admitted a patient without a regular doctor, he always referred him to one of the young physicians. " You call them at 3 A.M., and they 're actually happy to hear from you, " he said. " They do n't snarl. " <p> Even the interns ruminated more and more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt early planning was requisite in these baffling times. <p> If insurers expected a teaching hospital like St. Luke's-Roosevelt to groom a generation of doctors willing to obey the managed-care mantra, that did not seem to be happening. In the course of their year, all three of the interns, while appreciating some of the waste excised from medicine, had become of a piece in their increasing resistance to cost pressures and managed care. <p> Dr. Holland had begun without strong feelings about managed care. Now, he was sure he never wanted to work for an H.M.O. : " I do n't want to be part of a medical bureaucracy that seems to be ruining the health care system of the country. " <p> One particular episode framed his dismay. Needing to admit a 14-year-old boy with pneumonia, Dr. Holland had called the patient 's primary-care doctor. He said he did n't have privileges at St. Luke 's, and told him to call the managed-care plan. <p> When Dr. Holland reached a doctor who did have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age 13 and shuttled him to still another doctor, who informed him he only covered the East Side of Manhattan. <p> " I 'm practically screaming at the guy, " Dr. Holland said. " On the fourth or fifth doctor, I got someone who was able to approve it, and he made an exception because he was actually an adult doctor. " <p> Desiring a varied experience, Dr. Holland was mulling a mix of a standard urban pediatric practice and shifts in an emergency room. Two weeks a year would be reserved for something special : working at a small hospital in rural Brazil set up by the grandfather of a good friend from medical school. <p> After his residency, Dr. Lathan contemplated a one-year fellowship in disaster medicine and then a life traveling to earthquakes and war zones. This had always been part of his dream, but it had become even more enticing as a path to freedom from the vise of managed care. <p> He thought of the managed-care doctors he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing this to me? Are you going to admit every patient you see tonight? ' It was n't about the patient. It was about him. Managed care is an enemy. It 's not a team player. It 's going to crash. It has to. " <p> Dr. James had started out intending to become an H.M.O. doctor on a 9-to-5 schedule. Not anymore. " I do n't think they 're run well, " she said of H.M.O. 's. " And I want control. I never would have thought about a private practice before. " <p> Now, her desire was to have her own women 's health practice. She only wanted to see patients in the office ; when they went to the hospital, let doctors there care for them. " I want to narrow myself down to what I can be really good at, " she said. " I like to do procedures, and I want to do a lot of procedures. But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was her way of adapting to the new climate. " My whole life has been about dreaming up something and then going after it, " she said. <p> Still, she and the others knew that their success as doctors would also depend on how well they juggled money and resources, on marketing savvy and an ability to compromise. They had landed in a world that demanded doctors reassemble themselves to see 40 or 50 patients a day, a world of supersonic speed and diminishing remuneration and respect. They were not blind to this, but if there was one thing they felt they had got little of this first year, it was any explicit coaching in how to master the abstruse economics of doctoring. There seemed to be no time to teach them how best to use their time. <p> How much had they come to understand all the new cost pressures? <p> " Maybe a little bit more, " Dr. James said. <p> What was clear was that the interns were drawing definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " I 'm starting to value my life outside of medicine more than I ever thought I would, " Dr. James said. She felt happiest on days when she had outside activities. " I want to be a doctor, " she said, " but I want to take my Rollerblade lessons. I want to have a relationship with my husband. I want to have kids. " <p> As Dr. Lathan put it : " So much control has been taken away from us in practicing medicine. My own life seems like the only thing that 's truly mine. " A New Year, a New Role <p> Here is how internship ends. With the dawning of July 1, a date of ultimate significance only inside a teaching hospital, the three interns, as if chameleons, automatically changed identities : They officially became PGY-II 's( postgraduate year 2), entrusted with supervising the latest batch of interns, lording over the people they were only yesterday. <p> The prospect made them edgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the food chain. As PGY-II 's, they would no longer write progress notes or do endless I.V. ' s and blood draws. " They say the second year you have more time to think, " Dr. Holland said. " One senior resident put it like this : ' The first year you do, the second year you learn, the third year you teach. ' " Their pay crept up to $41,840 from $39,270, and there were small niceties. In the on-call room where the pediatric residents rested was a bunk bed. The bottom bunk was strictly for residents. The phone was not reachable from the top. Two interns had actually tumbled off the bunk in pursuit of a trilling phone. Dr. Holland could not wait to sleep on the bottom. <p> July 1 was thinly overcast, but the mood of the new PGY-II 's was joyous. " Hey, Mr. Resident, " they greeted one another. One ex-intern said he was going for coffee. Dr. James quipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> On this important day, Dr. Holland found himself at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, doing a bone marrow transplant rotation. Dr. Lathan had the day off, while Dr. James was in the St. Luke 's cardiac care unit. <p> Morning rounds went at a speed uncompromised for the new arrivals. The supervisor offered the platitude : " It 's like skating on thin ice. Speed is stability. " <p> As she cast an eye on the quizzical faces and listened to the creaking voices of the new interns, Dr. James assured them the anxiety would dissipate in the frenetic workload and the sweet satisfaction of making people better. She doled out some logistical pointers -- where the cafeteria was and the on-call room. She told them to be sure to eat breakfast before they came on duty ; on her first day, several interns had fainted.( Her own predilection for fainting notwithstanding, she had not been among them.) <p> She mentioned certain anomalies, like having to write a discharge summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she had been told that she had four delinquent charts. They were all dead patients who, she assumed, had been adequately processed by a higher authority. <p> There was plenty to do, malfunctioning hearts to be looked after. Lunch carts rattled past. Dr. James moved merrily about the murmuring floor, her dutiful intern clicking at her heels, and she knew she was one step closer in this complicated process of maturation and self-revelation, one step closer to a broader understanding of what sort of doctor she would become in a system under siege. <p> She took a drink of water, swished it between her teeth. What next? Her beeper went off. She reached for the phone. Her intern watched. A new cycle was starting. Life, Death and Managed Care At the midpoint of the year, exhausted but still standing, the interns found themselves whipsawed by mixed messages. They kept hearing about the need to conserve money and resources. And yet, in intensive care, Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient after hopeless patient. After a state investigation, Dr. Edward Lathan and the other E.R. doctors were told there was to be no thought or talk of money before a patient was examined. And Dr. Bryan Holland saw the senior doctors struggling to balance the duties of teaching and watching the bottom line. Today : As the interns are transformed into residents, they discover some bottom lines of their own.
