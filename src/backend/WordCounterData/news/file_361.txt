3061541 <p> We may not live by bread alone, but given the variety and quality of the loaves available in the Chicago area, it 's a tempting option. Bakers passionate about their craft are finding a growing audience for their products, both in retail shops and in restaurants. <p> Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises Inc. kicked off the local bread revolution when they opened Corner Bakery in October 1991. Under the watchful eye of chef/partner Jean Joho( Everest, Brasserie Jo) and on-site baker Jenny Smith, the bakery made 180 hand-shaped, crisp and hard-crusted loaves leavened with natural -- rather than commercial -- yeast starters the first day. <p> Eight years later, the company 's central commissary on the city 's North Side produces 20,000 pounds of bread a day for 20 retail venues and 180 restaurants. <p> " Only the numbers have changed, " says Ric Scicchitano, Corner Bakery 's vice president in charge of wholesale operations. " We still use starters made with natural yeasts, and we still raise the loaves in baskets and bake them in brick-lined, steam-injected ovens. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to do our kind of bread. " <p> With bread moving center stage, many restaurants, such as Campagnola in Evanston, have opted for customized loaves. Michael Altenberg, who owns the restaurant in partnership with Steve Schwartz, says, " Highland Baking Co. wanted our business, and they were willing to spend a lot of time working with us. " <p> One month and seemingly endless variations later, Altenberg and Schwartz had the crusty, chewy, flavorful loaf they wanted. Campagnola uses 200-plus loaves a week, and the number will increase considerably when the restaurant 's newly renovated second floor hits its stride. <p> As Altenberg points out, " Bread is the first thing a customer tastes. It sets the stage, and it has to be just right. " <p> Some restaurants make all -- or part -- of their bread on-site. <p> Highland Park 's C.F. Bistro, for example, does a crusty white bread made with a small amount of buckwheat flour, while erwin, an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf paired with a white bean puree. Spare Time Inc. does sourdough rolls for both their Hudson Club Restaurant &; Bar and Trocadero Bistro &; Bar, along with breads for a growing list of other restaurants. Like the buttermilk biscuits at Zinfandel, the signature cornbread at Lucky Platter in Evanston and Chicago is leavened with baking powder rather than yeast. <p> Composite breadbaskets are another trend whose time has come. <p> At Spago, the breadsticks, muffins, focaccia and aggressively seasoned flatbread are made on-site, the olive bread and baguettes are not. The eclectic breadbasket sets the stage for the equally diverse menu, a global romp replete with pot stickers, risotto, Wiener schnitzel, Cobb salad and foie gras. Moving from restaurant to retail, the scene is similarly mouth-watering. Red Hen Bakery in Bucktown has a retail and a wholesale business, as does Bread With Appeal on Armitage. Their repertoires are diverse, running the gamut from hard-crusted breads to scones. The crisp-crusted country peasant loaf sells especially well at Bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery 's Italian country bread. <p> One of the newest players on the retail scene is Nicole 's Bake Shop on Kingsbury. Owner Nicole Bergere has been supplying restaurants and retail shops for 15 years, but she has n't had a walk-in bakery since she relocated from the city 's Far North Side. The inventory varies, but Nicole 's Divine Crackers are always available and always crunchy. <p> Hearty Central and Eastern European breads were part of Chicago 's culinary landscape long before Corner Bakery produced its first crunchy baguette. Fingerhut Bakery( Cicero, Brookfield), for example, has been turning out its just-sweet-enough, wonderful-when-toasted, raisin-strewn Bohemian houska for more than 100 years. The limpa at Swedish Bakery( Andersonville) has a loyal clientele, as does the challah at Gitel 's Kosher Pastry Shop and Levinson 's Bakery, both on Devon Avenue. Then there 's the Polish rye at Pasieka Bakery on Milwaukee Avenue. <p> There 's no shortage of Italian bread in Chicago, and Casa Nostra on West Belmont bakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bari, Italy, and emigrated to the United States just as this country 's passion for Italian food was becoming insatiable. <p> Casa Nostra does a large restaurant business, and several retail stores, including Burhop 's in Wilmette and on North Avenue, carry a portion of their line. To sample everything, however, you have to visit Casa Nostra 's retail store/bake shop on the Northwest Side. <p> For anyone who likes their bread crusty, dense and full-flavored, Heavenly Hearth Bread Co. in Wilmette is not only worth a stop, it 's worth a special trip. The French boule has a moist texture and a hard crust, and the skinny baguettes are all about crust. <p> If you 're in the mood for something sweeter, try the yeast-raised cornbread with cranberries, the honey white, the cinnamon raisin or the cinnamon swirl. Specialty loaves, like the kalamata olive, are intensely flavored, so it 's a good idea to sample before you buy. <p> Breads are baked sequentially, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead to avoid disappointment, which when you think about it, is a good idea at most bakeries. There 's a lot of bread worth loving in Chicago, but there are also a lot of bread lovers. <p> Buttermilk biscuits <p> MAKES 15 BISCUITS <p> 4 cups cake or pastry flour <p> 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder <p> 3/4 teaspoon baking soda <p> 1 teaspoon salt, preferably sea salt <p> 13 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature <p> 1 2/3 cups buttermilk <p> 1.
