3001441 @ @ @ New York City police officer has been charged with brutally attacking a Haitian immigrant inside a Brooklyn station house last weekend, officials announced last night, adding that the essential information used against the officer was provided by one of his colleagues at the 70th Precinct. <p> Officer Charles Schwarz was named in an indictment handed up by a Brooklyn grand jury yesterday afternoon, as was Officer Justin A. Volpe, who was charged earlier this week with torturing the immigrant, Abner Louima, after he was arrested in a scuffle outside a nightclub. <p> Police Commissioner Howard Safir declined to discuss the specifics of the indictment or to detail what role Officer Schwarz is accused of playing. But law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they thought that Officer Schwarz restrained Mr. Louima in the station house bathroom while Officer Volpe shoved a toilet plunger 's wooden handle up the man 's rectum, causing critical injury, and then into his mouth, breaking teeth. <p> One high-ranking law enforcement official said Officer Schwarz, 32, who lives on Staten Island, faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and first-degree assault. <p> Announcing the indictment at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Safir said Officer Schwarz, a six-year veteran, had received a 15-day suspension in 1992 " for striking somebody in the face. " <p> Officer Schwarz surrendered to internal affairs detectives last night. " He is innocent of these charges, but unfortunately he will have to go through this lengthy and embarrassing process before he is vindicated, " his lawyer, Stephen Worth, said. <p> Commissioner Safir and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised the courage of the unnamed officer who provided information against Officer Schwarz, and said his cooperation put the lie to what the Commissioner called " the myth of the blue wall of silence. " Investigators agreed that more officers in the Flatbush precinct were stepping forward to cooperate. Other officers may be charged as well. <p> Some community leaders have said that while the current case was singularly repulsive, it reflected a broader problem in how the police under the Giuliani administration treat minority-group residents. To underscore that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as well as the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Democratic mayoral candidate, plan to hold a protest rally today in front of the 70th Precinct station house. " We see the 70th Precinct as the symbol of institutional neglect of the city to deal with police brutality, " said Mr. Sharpton, who lives in the precinct. <p> But Mayor Giuliani defended both his Police Department and his administration. " The communities of the city have to also not fall into the excessive anti-police rhetoric that some people would lead them to, " he said, " because that drives the police further away. " <p> Commissioner Safir met yesterday with Haitian community leaders, some of whom do not endorse Mr. Sharpton 's involvement in the planned protest rally. The Commissioner 's intent was to explain the Police Department 's stand against police brutality and to encourage leaders to hold a peaceful protest, Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode said. " We want everyone to keep calm heads, " she said. <p> Apart from the political salvos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday. Investigators from the office of Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, obtained court-ordered warrants, and were prepared to search the station-house lockers of police officers suspected of involvement in the attack. Meanwhile, detectives from the Police Department 's Internal Affairs Bureau dredged the sewers outside the station house, looking for the plunger thought to have been used in the assault. They recovered more knives, a machete, some bullets and some sticks of wood. While several of those items could be a toilet plunger 's handle, a police official said last night that investigators were not satisfied that they had the assault weapon. <p> The case of Abner Louima was slow in coming to light -- reports of an assault on him on Saturday did not become public until Tuesday -- but his account of torture, related from his hospital bed, has dominated news reports this week. <p> With each passing day, new details emerge -- some contradictory, some revelatory -- about the chain of events inside a drab police station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30, a night security guard from Jamaica, Queens, was arrested after a scuffle between the police and revelers leaving a Flatbush Avenue nightclub where a Haitian band had been playing. The brawling occurred in a precinct in which some officers and some Haitian residents share a growing distrust of one another. <p> During the fighting, witnesses say, a police officer handed his gun belt to a partner and began exchanging blows with Mr. Louima. Whether that officer was Justin Volpe remains unclear. Investigators said Mr. Louima knocked Officer Volpe to the ground ; the officer 's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, said Mr. Louima struck his client in the face, and that Officer Volpe and four other officers later went to the hospital with minor injuries. <p> Investigators said they are reviewing the recordings of radio communications between the precinct dispatcher and officers after Mr. Louima 's arrest. He has said that two police officers, neither of whom was Officer Volpe, stopped twice to beat him while taking him to the station house. <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators believe that Officer Volpe took charge of Mr. Louima there. " He hit me, " the official quoted the officer as saying. " This collar is mine. " <p> Then Officer Volpe and Officer Schwarz took Mr. Louima into the bathroom, law enforcement officials said. As Officer Schwarz beat and held Mr. Louima, they say, Officer Volpe assaulted the man with the wooden handle. Mr. Louima said one of the two officers said, " This is Giuliani time, not Dinkins time, " a reference to David N. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani 's predecessor, who was often at odds with the rank-and-file police. <p> Officer Volpe then brought Mr. Louima, still handcuffed, to the station house 's holding cell, investigators said. Stuart London, the lawyer for Officer Thomas Bruder, Officer Volpe 's partner that night, said that his client went into the cell and removed the handcuffs. <p> Investigators said that the precinct called for an ambulance for Mr. Louima at 6:01 A.M., more than an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ambulance arrived about 6:25. <p> But the ambulance did not leave the station house until 7:58, more than 90 minutes after arriving, as paramedics waited for police officers, as required, to escort them as they took Mr. Louima to the hospital. <p> Mr. Louima was immediately listed in critical condition at Coney Island Hospital, with a tear to his colon, a laceration to his bladder and abrasions to his mouth. Doctors said that a blunt instrument had apparently been shoved into his rectum, and that it would take months for him to recover from his injuries. Yesterday afternoon he was transferred to the intensive care unit at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. <p> Police officials dropped the charges against Mr. Louima on Wednesday, and on Thursday ordered a shake-up at the 70th Precinct, in part to encourage officers to come forward with information. The two top commanders were removed, a desk sergeant was suspended and nine officers were placed on desk duties. <p> While denouncing the brutality in the Louima case, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an isolated matter, far removed from the dedication of a majority of the police force 's 38,000 members. They lavished praise on the unnamed officer who provided information essential to the case. <p> " He put decency and the law and concern for other human beings above misplaced loyalty, " the Mayor said. In acknowledgment of the risk that the officer took, the Commissioner said, " We are taking steps to protect him. " <p> Still, Mr. Louima 's account that one attacker boasted of a license to brutalize under the Giuliani administration continued to haunt the Mayor, no matter how vehemently he portrayed it as ludicrous. Two of his most vociferous political opponents, Mr. Sharpton and former Mayor Dinkins, who are not usually political allies, ended a visit to Mr. Louima 's hospital bedside yesterday morning with a joint attack on the Mayor. Mr. Dinkins said the Giuliani administration 's aggressive approach to law enforcement, typified by its quality-of-life crackdown, encourages officers to treat residents in a brusque manner approaching harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good and honest and fair-minded, that wo n't be a problem for him or her, " Mr. Dinkins said. " But for those police officers who are inclined to step over the line, it 's real dangerous, because they think that it is sanctioned to behave as they wish. " <p> On the other hand, Ruth W. Messinger, the likely Democratic challenger to Mr. Giuliani in the November election, praised the Mayor 's handling of the case. In an interview on CNN, she said Mr. Giuliani 's response was " right on target. " <p> At Club Rendez-Vous, where Mr. Louima 's ordeal began, clubgoers held a candlelight vigil last night and made plans to take part in today 's protest at the precinct station. <p> The same band that played on Tuesday night, the Phantoms, played last night, but to a decidedly smaller crowd. <p> " I think we have to go on and show that we are still a community, " said Serge Demorcery, a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> King Kino, the lead singer of the Phantoms, said : " We want to show that we are civilized people. We live here, we are taxpayers and we have to go on with our lives.
