3073541 <p> That means the clock starts ticking on the 1990 season next weekend with no games in sight. Players will find themselves locked out of spring training camps, and while both sides are ready to talk again, the next important date may not come until early March, with the start of the regular season in jeapordy. <p> Both sides still appear to be dug firmly into their philosophical foxholes. Chuck O'Connor, the owners ' chief negotiator, said yesterday that although he 's willing to discuss such issues as pension and minimum salary, there would be no retreat from an insistence on the No. 1 arguing point -- that the players agree to a revenue sharing plan. ##He seemed to kill speculation from Friday 's owners meeting that his side was willing to soften. <p> Several players and a high-ranking official of the Major League Players Association said they expected as much. They said the owners had planned a spring training lockout for more than a year and that baseball in 1990 could be a long time coming. They repeated that they would accept no plan that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free agency. <p> " I think there 's some frustration on our part, not to have gotten responses to our inquiries, " said Eugene Orza, associate counsel for the players ' union. " Management has made the exact same proposal every day in the face of a huge, enormous barrage of data that says there 's no foundation for the proposal anyway. They came up with a proposal they knew the players would n't accept, and by virtue of that they got the confrontation they wanted. " <p> Because of that, Orza said the players and owners are arguing the same basic point they 've argued since the players legally won free agency in 1975. <p> " The clubs do n't like competition for their players, " he said, " and every time one contract expires they begin working to get it into the next one. The owners like competition for the television contracts. They like cities competing for the franchises. They like it when hot dog makers compete for the right to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers and not sellers. " <p> O'Connor spent much of yesterday meeting with his staff and said he would do so again today in preparation for Monday 's session. In a lengthy interview, he tried to end speculation of a radical new proposal and to address the players ' concerns about the previous one. <p> " Listen, it 's not like we have a stem-to-stern strategy scribbled out on envelopes, and if the players do n't accept one we open the next one, " he said. " I ca n't say we wo n't go in with a different perspective, because, after you 've met with your group, you do. The time, the debate, the discussion all evolve. At some point, there has to be a reaching out. Both sides have to reshape their proposals to address the other 's concerns. We have to do it and they have to do the same thing for us. You ca n't reach an agreement if you do n't have some negotiation on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complex pay-for-performance system by which players in their first six years would have their salaries determined by statistical formula. The players, however, never have viewed that system as anything more than a negotiating ploy. <p> What they 've said is that revenue sharing would put caps on salaries and restrict free agency, and they 've criticized the owners for not being able to tell them whether salaries would rise or fall under the proposed system. <p> " We ca n't tell them precisely, just like they ca n't tell us what the average salary will be in 1993 under the current system, " O'Connor said. " We can tell them that if the system were in place now the average salary would be $ 611,000 in 1990. I do n't think they 're going to reach that under the current system the average salary is expected to be around $ 500,000 in 1990. We can also tell them it would rise to $ 770,000 over the life of the contract in 1993. But where exactly the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give them parameters and they have to be willing to take the risk, just as we have to be willing to take the risk. " <p> He insisted that his charge from the owners was never to come up with a system that was more profitable. Instead, they wanted a system that provided more cost certainty, to prevent payrolls from doubling and tripling from one year to the next. <p> " We want the union to tell us, in percentage terms, what they ought to earn, " he said. " They 've said they wo n't do it. They have concerns that there would be restrictions on free agency. The only restriction would be on the upper lid of salaries. <p> " These issues are fundamental to us, but negotiation is the art of the possible. It 's like politics. Not everyone 's going to get everything they want, but everyone 's going to get something. Everyone leaves the table a bit satisfied and a bit disappointed. It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it works. " <p> Until it does work, players are on their own. Beginning Thursday, the Baltimore Orioles will will be prevented from using the pitching mounds, batting cages and weight rooms inside Memorial Stadium. <p> Some Orioles have talked about organizing workouts at Towson State University, but the problem is that Memorial Stadium has the area 's only indoor baseball facilities. <p> At meetings Thursday and Friday, Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players Association, told the players to stop working out and to " go fishing and play golf. " <p> " The owners did us a service by warning us so far in advance this might happen, " Orioles outfielder Phil Bradley said. " They 've been putting lockout language in contracts since mid-1988, and the last player who did n't get lockout language was Bruce Hurst December 1988. They must have been planning this for quite a while. " <p> ##
