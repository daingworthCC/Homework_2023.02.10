4115541 The world Texas 700,000 or so deer hunters see from their blinds when the sun comes up Nov. 5, opening day of the general white-tailed deer hunting season across the state, promises to be quite different from the one they saw on opening day 2010. # They 'll likely see more deer and certainly a very different landscape than they did this past season, when a record number of Texas deer hunters( 692,000) took an estimated 688,000 whitetails, also a record. # " You ca n't have the level of drought Texas has seen this year and it not have an impact, " Alan Cain, who heads deer programs for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 's wildlife division, said of the coming deer season, the state 's white-tailed herd and the habitat on which they depend. " It may not be the best year for antlers, but I suspect hunters are going to see a lot of deer and all kinds of deer - some really poor deer and some deer that are going to surprise people. # " It 's going be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought that has turned much of Texas into a seared, brown landscape began in earnest last autumn. And it came in the wake of a very wet winter and spring that left most of the state lush and green and its 4 million or so white-tailed deer, which had one of their best fawn crops in years, well-fed and healthy. # Dry times # All that abundance evaporated over winter as the drought took hold. # Lack of winter and spring rains meant little or no production of forbs, the low-growing, weedy, leafy plants on which deer greatly depend during those seasons. # The brutally hot and dry summer meant no significant growth of the highly nutritious shoots and tips of shrubs and vines that provide the browse deer eat through the summer. # " We saw a really poor winter for forbs, and the big flush of browse that you see in spring and summer just was not there, " said Gary Calkins, TPWD wildlife division district leader for the two dozen or so deer-rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you can drive for miles and see country without a stitch of grass on it and thousands of dead junipers, you know things are bad, " said David Veale, head of TPWD 's South Texas wildlife division programs. # The drought 's biggest impact on the state 's deer herd has been on fawn production and survival. Many pregnant does that struggled to find forage during the crucial late-winter/early spring period miscarried. Those that did drop fawns lost many of them, some succumbing to lack of food and others falling prey to predators because the drought-blistered landscape provided little or no cover. # " Overall, it was pretty bad, " Calkins said of fawn survival in the Pineywoods. # In an average year, about 45 percent of fawns survive through late summer. This year, that number was less than 20 percent in much of the region. Veale reported similar numbers from South Texas. # In some hard-hit areas of the Panhandle, fawn survival was less than 10 percent, Cain said. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at or below carrying capacity of the available habitat, fawn survival has been good, even under drought conditions. # " There are places where managers kept deer at moderate density levels that reported fawn crops of 70 percent, " Cain said. # Those well-managed areas also saw adult deer manage quite well through the drought. # " Deer are very adaptable animals, " Veale said. " This is n't the first drought they 've been through. " # Too many mouths # While there have been no documented, drought-related major die-offs of deer, some scattered losses have been reported. Much more common have been reports of deer in very poor body condition. # Invariably, those " skin-and-bones " deer are on land where populations are far higher than the stressed habitat can support. # " The problems are on places where deer densities were too high even before the drought, " Veale said. # But hunters in areas where deer populations have n't mushroomed far beyond the land 's capacity to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # " There are some bucks out there that are going to surprise people, " Calkins said. " Deer in well-managed places are in surprisingly good condition. " # That 's been validated by some of the deer taken this month by bowhunters and on some of the early-season deer hunts in TPWD wildlife management areas. # None of the more than two dozen deer taken on youth-only hunts earlier this month on the Justin Hurst WMA near Lake Jackson were in poor body condition. # " Most of the deer were either in very good or excellent body condition - none of them were in poor shape, " said Hurst WMA staffer David Hailey, who noted the young hunters took a handful of large-antlered bucks. # Earlier this month, a bowhunter on TPWD 's Richland Creek WMA in Freestone and Navarro counties arrowed a buck whose antlers scored 177 points, non-typical gross, on the Boone and Crockett Club scoring system. It was the highest-scoring buck ever legally taken off the WMA. # Even if they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to see a lot of deer. Lack of low-growing vegetation means deer will be more easily seen. And those deer will be moving a lot, looking for something to eat. # Gladly taking handouts # With forbs and browse in short supply and a spotty acorn crop predicted, deer will be more attracted to feeders distributing corn kernels or protein pellets. # " That 's likely to make it easier for hunters to take deer this year, " Calkins said. " And we 're recommending that they do just that. # " If there 's a silver lining( to the drought), it 's that it gives us a chance to catch up - get deer numbers back into line with the habitat, " Cain said. " We need to get mouths off of the range, especially in areas where deer numbers are through the roof. # " The earlier hunters can take deer this season, the better. " # If the drought continues through winter, as some predict, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cain said. # " If we do n't get rain and we do n't get deer numbers down, we 're likely to see some late-winter mortality of bucks and fawns, " he said. # **26;15206;TOOLONG #... # Keep up online : For more outdoors news, stories and photos, log on to **39;15234;TOOLONG... #
