3003641 <p> " So what are we doing today? " Afghanistan 's president, Hamid Karzai, asked the United States ambassador, Zalmay M. Khalilzad, as they sat in Mr. Karzai 's office. <p> Mr. Khalilzad patiently explained that they would attend a ceremony to kick off the " greening " of Kabul -- the planting and seeding of 850,000 trees -- in honor of the Afghan New Year. <p> Mr. Karzai said he would speak off-the-cuff. Mr. Khalilzad, sounding more mentor than diplomat, approved : " It 's good you do n't have a text, " he told Mr. Karzai. " You tend to do better. " <p> The genial Mr. Karzai may be Afghanistan 's president, but the affable, ambitious Mr. Khalilzad often seems more like its chief executive. With his command of both details and American largesse, the Afghan-born envoy has created an alternate seat of power since his arrival on Thanksgiving. <p> As he shuttles between the American Embassy and the presidential palace, where Americans guard Mr. Karzai, one place seems an extension of the other. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Mr. Khalilzad ponders whether to push for the removal of uncooperative governors, where roads should be built to undercut insurgency, and how to ensure that the elements friendly to America gain ascendancy in a democratic Afghanistan. His overarching goal is to accelerate the country 's rebuilding and securing, preferably on a timetable attuned to the American political cycle. <p> As a State Department and Pentagon official and at the Rand Corporation, he advocated pre-emptive action against so-called rogue states like Iraq. Now he is formulating -- on the ground, and on the fly -- that doctrine 's previously neglected bookend : how to fill the void those governments leave behind. And as the United States struggles to get it right, policy makers in Washington are closely watching Mr. Khalilzad, an academic and policy planner. <p> " In many ways we 're experimenting, " Mr. Khalilzad admitted. <p> Until it regains sovereignty this summer, Iraq has an almost wholly American administration. Mr. Khalilzad must work with a government with its own head of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Where L. Paul Bremer III has an occupation authority staffed by hundreds of Americans, Mr. Khalilzad is working with only a handful of advisers, one-tenth the number of American troops in Iraq, and this year, about one-tenth the financing. <p> The question is how much Mr. Khalilzad can do with so much less. <p> Provincial Reconstruction Teams of fewer than 100 soldiers are being deployed to provide a security presence and support reconstruction. Mr. Khalilzad has brought in a coterie of senior advisers, including a former " change agent " for companies like American Airlines, to provide ideas and jump-start the private sector. <p> " This all has to work, " said the acting Army secretary, Les Brownlee, during a meeting with Mr. Khalilzad. " If it does n't, we 're never going to get out of here. " <p> Mr. Khalilzad has less outright power than Mr. Bremer, but possibly as much influence. That is partly because America 's 15,500 troops -- up from 11,000 a few months ago -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Afghanistan, among the world 's poorest, most fragile countries. <p> It is also because he has the ear of Mr. Karzai, whom he often sees two or three times a day, the ambassador 's distinct laugh echoing from the president 's inner sanctum. The two have known each other for 20 years, since Mr. Khalilzad became involved with supporting the anti-Soviet mujahedeen. Then an official in the Reagan administration, he helped funnel support and Stinger missiles to Islamic fundamentalists, some of whom, like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, later became America 's fiercest opponents. <p> Mr. Hekmatyar " is your old friend, " a former Hekmatyar commander named Sabawun, who now is advising Mr. Karzai, told Mr. Khalilzad during a brief palace encounter. Old friends become enemies, they agreed, and left it at that. <p> Mr. Khalilzad himself knows how compasses change. In the mid-1990 's, he briefly defended the Taliban while working as a consultant for Unocal, the oil company that was then trying to build a pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fiercest critics. <p> Born in Mazar-i-Sharif 53 years ago, Mr. Khalilzad, Pashtun by ethnicity, speaks Dari and Pashto. He understands and remains comfortable with the intrigues and intimacies, the informality, the talk and the tribal ties that are so much of political business here. <p> " You are working for two countries, the United States and Afghanistan, " one tribal leader from Helmand Province told him. <p> More seasoned Afghan officials say they are clear that Zal, as Mr. Khalilzad is known, answers to the Bush administration. It dispatched him here to ensure that Afghanistan has visible progress and a successful election in advance of the American one, and to judge whether a greater infusion of money and attention now can reduce the bill to American taxpayers later. <p> His plan is to speed the building of the army and police, and to develop the private sector largely by luring expatriates back to invest. He has used his influence to help secure land for projects like a new Hyatt hotel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and top-tier hospital to serve returning elites, although critics note that many Afghans lack the most basic health care and education. <p> He preaches a narrative of American self-sufficiency, exhorting Afghans to do more for themselves and depend less on foreign donors and their government. <p> " Tell the story of America, especially its early days, " he encouraged Americans gathered at a town hall meeting in the capital of the country that was once his. <p> Mr. Khalilzad celebrated the Afghan New Year in March with 12 hours of meetings. The first was with bearded, turbaned tribal leaders from Helmand Province, whom he met at the presidential palace, a location that signaled their prestige, and his access. <p> His goal was to secure better cooperation with coalition forces, while acting as a buffer against resentment of those forces. Helmand was a strong support base for the Taliban, and the American military has been unhappy with the attitude of its governor, Sher Muhammad Akhundzada. <p> " We are curious why so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American troops, " the ambassador told the leaders, and asked what would happen if the governor were moved from the province. He jokingly warned them against playing " tribal games " with him, alerting them he knew they come from the governor 's tribe. <p> The tribal leaders stoutly defended the governor, and in turn complained about the conduct of coalition troops and their Afghan allies. The way house searches are being conducted " will compel people to revolt, " one elder warned. <p> Mr. Khalilzad later said that he worried that American military tactics could drive Afghans toward the Taliban, but he replied that the governor should create understanding between the tribes and the troops. " I think he will stay in the province as long as these problems are solved, " Mr. Khalilzad said, putting diplomatic finesse on what amounted to an ultimatum. <p> He pointedly reminded the leaders that he is a Muslim. Together, they prayed for the success of Afghanistan. <p> The trees were planted. He and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that Mr. Khalilzad is ferociously prodding. He is frustrated with the United Nations, which so far has registered 1.5 million out of an estimated 10 million potential voters for elections that have been pushed back to September from June. He said of United Nations operatives, " Frankly they have been relatively slow, " a criticism the United Nations disputes. <p> Under his auspices, the United States is allocating $60 million over two years to speed police training, with the goal of having 20,000 officers to secure elections by the end of June. The training effort has been German-led, but here, as elsewhere, the impatient Mr. Khalilzad is tempering multilateralism with a more active American role. <p> Mr. Khalilzad is also trying to shore up support for Mr. Karzai 's government by providing visible signs of reconstruction, an effort that could provoke resentment from other factions as the elections approach. Recent weeks have brought choreographed announcements about hundreds of schools and clinics to be built or rehabilitated in the next few months -- more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critics say such haste, along with the government 's lack of money and trained personnel, risks littering Afghanistan with unstaffed buildings. <p> But Mr. Khalilzad is pressing ahead. At an afternoon briefing, he showed Mr. Karzai where the schools would be built. " I have already discussed with a couple of provinces to trade two or three elementary schools for a larger high school, " Mr. Khalilzad said, not bothering to hide his ability to barter with American money. <p> The United States has hired a Washington-based communications company, the Rendon Group, to bolster Mr. Karzai 's communications office. And in a brief huddle at the palace, Mr. Khalilzad and the head of intelligence, Amrullah Saleh, discussed how the Afghan people regarded the government -- and, as Mr. Khalilzad put it, " things we could do to help the standing of the government without working through the government. " <p> He has also pushed hard to accelerate the disarmament of the country 's militias, which many see as the essential condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new plan that would demobilize 40 percent of Afghan militias -- the same forces that arose to fight the Soviets, then lived on to fight the Taliban and one another. <p> Radical in its ambition, the plan would amount to sending home as many as 35,000 soldiers in the next three months, though less than 6,000 have been demobilized since the United Nations started the process in October. <p> Mr. Khalilzad has been personally negotiating with the defense minister, Muhammad Qasim Fahim, over how best to do it. The United States allied with Mr. Fahim, then the Northern Alliance commander, after Sept. 11, but even today American officials remain uncertain whose side he is on. <p> " I 'm still shadow-boxing with Minister Fahim, " Mr. Khalilzad said at one point. <p> In a meeting at the embassy, Mr. Khalilzad asked Mr. Brownlee, the acting Army secretary, his impression of Mr. Fahim. <p> " Tough guy, " Mr. Brownlee said. " I have no idea the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's still the question, " said David Sedney, the deputy chief of mission. <p> " He always says the right thing -- or at least recently, " Mr. Khalilzad said, explaining that Mr. Fahim wanted to be Mr. Karzai 's vice presidential candidate. <p> Mr. Khalilzad wants to speed the training of the Afghan National Army, which after some $500 million in American investment has fewer than 8,000 soldiers. In the evening, he led a meeting on the subject with military planners. They discussed how big an army the country needed, the likely threats Afghanistan would face, the money Washington might provide in coming years. <p> " What models are we talking about for a future relationship with Afghanistan? " Mr. Khalilzad asked. " This has to be linked to that. " <p> The discussion turned to how long to embed American trainers with Afghan battalions. The question arose : Were the military men considering how long it would take to create an ethnically harmonious army, or just what it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military men said. <p> Such tensions -- between military and civilian perspectives, short and long-term interests -- perpetually bedevil this enterprise. Mr. Khalilzad, for example, worries that the Americans are cultivating dependence by coming 10,000 miles to build concrete schools for Afghans who once built stunning palaces and mosques. But he concedes that he is pushing the school-building, because the Americans and Mr. Karzai need the good will now. <p> Mr. Khalilzad has changed his view that the Afghans, having resisted the British and Soviets so fiercely, would permit only a light foreign footprint. Now he believes that they crave foreign help -- but that he must carefully calibrate how heavy a footprint they will stand. <p> If the United States maintains enough aid, he said, Afghanistan can be a close friend, an Islamic democracy, a more prosperous place. " This experiment we were forced into getting involved in can be a success, " he said. " It requires sustaining the course. " He knows better than most how hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the early 1990 's, Mr. Khalilzad was part of a Bush administration that looked away as Afghanistan devoured itself in a civil war. Today he tells Afghans that the American abandonment was a mistake, and vows that this time will be different. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com <p> CORRECTION-DATE : April 22, 2004 <p> CORRECTION : <p> Because of an editing error, a front-page picture caption on Saturday about the renovation of a school in Afghanistan misstated the date of the renovation work shown in the picture.
