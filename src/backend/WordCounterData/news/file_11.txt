3001641 <p> Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. <p> JOHN CORCORAN Frequent Traveler <p> In the 20 years that John and Diann Corcoran were married, goodbyes rolled around every 84 days. <p> Mr. Corcoran, known to everyone as Jay, was in the merchant marine, a first engineer on huge cargo ships. His schedule had him sailing all over the Far East for tours of 84 days. When he finished he went home to Norwell, Mass. -- for 84 days. <p> " Jay often said to me, ' If you add it all up, people who travel for business could be gone as long as I am, " ' said Mr. Corcoran 's sister Donna Corcoran Schwartz. When he returned from the sea, the first thing Mr. Corcoran, 43, did was catch up on his sleep. Then, his wife said, he was in perpetual motion, golfing, doing yardwork, going on field trips with his children, Meghan and Jake, and working on his cabin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for another goodbye. On Sept. 11 Mrs. Corcoran drove him to the airport to catch a plane for Los Angeles. It was United flight 175, which would strike the World Trade Center. <p> They got out of the car and embraced. As Mr. Corcoran went through the doors, Mrs. Corcoran wanted to call him back. " I 'd get that panic every time he traveled, " she said. As always, she let him go. Then she got back into her car, already anticipating -- as she did at every goodbye -- " the next hello. " <p> DONALD W. ROBERTSON JR. Ireland in His Soul <p> It was hard to find a photograph of Donald W. Robertson Jr., 35, for the prayer card for his memorial Mass. A father of four, he was seen in all his pictures with a child climbing on him. The family had to crop him out of a family reunion shot to get a photo without a small arm or leg draped around him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Donnie put her pierced earrings in her ears, " said one of his sisters, Kathy Cunningham. " That is the ultimate hands-on, gentle dad. " <p> She remembers her mother making her take her brother, who was almost nine years younger, to church. " But she did n't know that we 'd pull up, he 'd run in, get the bulletin, come back out, and the car full of us would drive off to Friendly 's, " Ms. Cunningham recalled. " He was along for the ride in every way. " <p> Although Mr. Robertson, a vice president of sales with eSpeed, who lived in Rumson, N.J., had a shamrock tattoo, he never made it to Ireland. His mother is taking ashes from ground zero to an ancient burial ground in Glendalough, County Wicklow, in a few weeks, his father said. On March 9, an Irish flag flew over the New Jersey governor 's mansion in his honor. <p> EDWARD A. BRENNAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sports, so he would read the sports pages before starting the day at Cantor Fitzgerald, where he was a vice president and a bonds broker. <p> " One day, he walked away from his desk and left his newspaper, " said his mother, Gail Brennan. " The guy next to him removed the sports section and added the living section from another newspaper to watch his reaction. My son came back and went bananas. He said, ' That so-and-so put two living sections in my paper! ' Everyone around him collapsed laughing because they knew that it was the first thing that he did in the morning. " <p> Mr. Brennan, 37, whom everyone called Teddy, was known for his sharp mind and uncanny sense of humor. " He had an amazing mind for math, " his mother said. He was an avid golfer, playing at a club on the Jersey Shore, not far from his native Sea Girt, where he had hoped to retire. The strapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf course : black golf socks and a golf shirt two sizes too small, buttoned up to the neck. Mrs. Brennan said that he probably wore the shirts to show off his biceps, which he worked hard to develop. <p> Mr. Brennan was the oldest and only male of four siblings, including twins. He was engaged to be married to Meghan Daly, whom he had met about two years before Sept. 11. <p> PATRICK CURRIVAN Inquisitive Voyager <p> Patrick Currivan was intensely curious, which made him a wonderful traveler. " Whatever chance he got he quizzed people, " said Kathy Marshall, a neighbor who visited Egypt with him. " He really delved into their understanding and knowledge of their own country, where they were and who they were, and he constantly asked questions. And if you were smart, you stood around and waited to hear the answers. " <p> He had traveled extensively on the Silk Route and in Syria, and was particularly interested in the richness of Islamic culture, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's husband, Paul. <p> Mr. Currivan, 52, a vice president at Atos-Euronext, was born in Ireland and had moved about a decade ago from Paris to Winchester, Mass. He was on Flight 11. His friend John Adamson remembers Mr. Currivan as a gifted talker. " He would drop a well-chosen phrase or word into a conversation, then stand back and watch the effect with a big twinkle in his eye. " <p> DAMION MOWATT Worked for Better Days <p> Damion Mowatt used to take his youngest brother, Andre, to a club to play basketball, and would help him out by buying sneakers for him. <p> Mr. Mowatt, 21, worked at Forte Food Service, which served the World Trade Center, and he had been thinking about going to college. " He wanted to work to pay his part, " said his mother, Andrea Mowatt. <p> " He looked at the World Trade Center as a landmark, " she said. " He was n't thinking of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Trade Center, it was always with a lift, like it was good to be working up there. " <p> Mrs. Mowatt was 15 when he was born, in Jamaica. " For someone so young, who was not working, it was not easy for us, " she said. " I had this bond with him, from a lot of struggle. " <p> They used to talk for hours in the kitchen, in Flatbush, Brooklyn, while she cleaned up after meals. " Damion, I just finished washing dishes and I am thinking about you as I do every day, " she wrote on a Web site dedicated to him. " Every day you are with us. So long as our heart is beating, yours is too. " <p> STUART S. LOUIS Sand-Dappled Memories <p> It was hot in Chinatown in the summer, so in 1955 Stuart Louis 's mother bought a bungalow in Bradley Beach, N.J. Friday-night memories are salt-tinged for the Louis children, who rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth of highway toward the sea. <p> Other families from Chinatown followed, and soon there was a community where the grandmothers played mah-jongg all afternoon and the children grew up running along the sand together. Stuart Louis befriended a boy named Bobby Louie( their last names are written the same way in Chinese, and both mean thunder.) They were inseparable, said Mr. Louis 's sister, Sylven Beck. He married Bobby 's sister, Sharon, and Bobby was his best man. <p> Mr. Louis rose to become managing director at Sandler O'Neill, on the 104th floor of 2 World Trade Center. He and Sharon had two children, Kara and Evan. Mr. Louis, 43, would get home to East Brunswick, N.J., in time to attend parent-teacher conferences and to help Kara and Evan with their homework. " He made it fun, " his wife said. <p> " He was more of a family man than most people, " Gordon Russo, a former colleague, recalled. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticker-tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes for his team, he slipped out of the office and stood on the sidewalk cheering, pennant in hand. <p> DORIS S. TORRES Small in Stature Only <p> Doris S. Torres was soft-spoken, sweet, and very petite -- about five feet tall. But " she had so much inner strength that she seemed to be like seven feet tall, " said her sister, Mercedes. <p> On Sept. 11 and for a few days after, Ms. Torres made great use of that strength. She worked in foreign trade for Fiduciary Trust International, and left her office on the 97th floor of the south tower as soon as the first plane hit the north tower. She helped an emotional colleague down a few flights and returned to help others. Ms. Torres eventually made it out of the building, but she was severely burned. She was taken to St. Vincent 's Manhattan Hospital, where she died on Sept. 16, her family said. <p> Ms. Torres, 32, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close. She shared a house in the Bronx with her mother, Blanca Cruz-Aquino. " I miss her every day, " Mrs. Cruz-Aquino said. " I continue to hear her steps every morning, coming down the steps to go to work. " <p> The eldest of four children raised in Brooklyn, Ms. Torres considered raising her son, Anthony Small, 15, her greatest accomplishment. " Her biggest passion and her biggest pride was her son, " said Ms. Torres 's sister, who is now his guardian. " They were very close. " <p> It is a pride that they now return, many times over. " She is my hero, " said Mrs. Cruz-Aquino. " I have my hope that some day I 'm going to hug her and give her a kiss. I know I will. " <p> DONALD T. JONES II Brimming With Confidence <p> Donald T. Jones II had confidence to spare, and it began in the cradle. " He was a salesman, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't back down from something he wanted. " <p> It helped him rise in the Cantor Fitzgerald hierarchy, where he was hired on the bond desk shortly after college. He spotted Michele Ramirez on her first day of work there and immediately declared he would marry her. It took more than a year, but she eventually agreed. <p> They had Taylor, now 6, and Donnie, 3. Mr. Jones, who was 39, raced home to Livingston, N.J., from the office to be with them. He taught them his favorite Aerosmith songs and schooled them in the art of blackjack. " There 's no Go Fish happening in this house, " Mrs. Jones said. <p> He showed Taylor, a southpaw, how to play baseball, and bought her a glove. " It makes her very happy, " her mother said, " that she has the glove Daddy bought her. " He took Donnie with him on long bicycle rides, and gave him a tiny mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too soon, " his mother said. " He could n't use the pedals for a long time. And then after this happened, we took the bike out because it was still nice weather in September. And then we found out he could pedal. " <p> SCOTT A. LARSEN Fan of Disney World <p> When Scott A. Larsen finished a shift at the firehouse -- " He was very good with the tools ; he fit right into the place, " said Brian Cleary, his friend from Ladder Company 163 -- off he 'd go in pursuit of more activity, usually with his three children. He outfitted them with Rollerblades, and got them onto their bicycles on summer days. He could spend an entire day at the beach, then fix dinner on the grill. During the midwinter school break, he packed everyone into the car and drove from their home in Glendale, Queens, to Disney World, stopping to spend the night in North Carolina, to buy sparklers in South Carolina, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason-Dixon line. <p> It meant 12 hours of driving at a stretch, but he loved it. On arrival, Firefighter Larsen, who was 35, headed for Space Mountain, where he usually rode solo. " He 'd try to convince the kids to go on it, " said his wife, Carolann. " Once he bribed them with a stuffed animal. They came off scared like anything. " <p> The children are Marisa, 9 ; Brenda, 8 ; and Scott, 5. On Sept. 13, their little brother was born. Mrs. Larsen named him August, a name she and her husband had chosen. <p> KLAUS SPROCKAMP A Visitor From Germany <p> Johannes Sprockamp, now 6, asks his mother Beate daily if he can call Papa in heaven. On Sept. 11, his father, Klaus Sprockamp, was at an 8:30 a.m. meeting at the World Trade Center that was supposed to last an hour. Mr. Sprockamp, 42, was the chief financial officer and chief operating officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had recently hired Tracy M. Coffey, who was late to that meeting and who has since become friends with his family -- close enough to be able to describe their lives before Sept. 11. <p> Mr. Sprockamp, she said, loved riding motorcycles until he met Beate, a surgeon. " He just completely fell in love with her, and he stopped with the whole motorcycle thing and settled for a convertible, " Ms. Coffey said. <p> One of his passions was maintaining the hillside landscape surrounding their home in Muhltal, Germany. The boys wanted to be like their father. " Can I mow the lawn now? " Johannes asks. <p> Johannes is a serious boy, full of thought and wonder. He is quieter now and very often full of anger. His brother, Lucas, 4, has been persistent in the notion that " if the terrorists knew how much we love Papa, they would n't have flown the plane into the tower. " He just recently began sleeping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tattoo <p> People like to be around someone who enjoys herself, and Linda Joyce Jones enjoyed herself. The daily annoyances of urban life bounced off her like raindrops, and the stresses of her job in the insurance-brokerage business never seemed to get to her, either. <p> " She was a spiritual uplift for me when I would get depressed, " said Gene Sorrenti, who worked with her until the early 1990 's. <p> She went to church, raised a daughter, befriended her husband 's eight children from a previous marriage, listened to singers like Luther Vandross, and moved up to a position at Aon, in the World Trade Center, after years at smaller firms. <p> After her husband, Robert Lee Jones, died a year ago, Mrs. Jones, who was 49 at the time, got herself a new hairstyle and some new clothes. She also got a butterfly tattoo. " It was a midlife crisis, basically, " said her daughter, Jennifer. " She just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At night she would come home and play with her only grandchild, Jennifer 's infant son, Darrion, who was just 4 months old in September. " A lot of people say he looks a little bit like her, " said Miss Jones. " I noticed when his two top teeth came in, he had a gap between them just like my mother 's. " <p> ROBERT J. GSCHAAR Doting Stepfather <p> At an Exchange Place office party many Christmases ago, employees of insurance companies traded office gossip and inside jokes. Then Robert J. Gschaar thought of a topic that would interest people regardless of where they worked. " If someone was to play you in a movie, " he asked a small cluster of people, " who would that person be? " <p> The small group grew larger and nearby conversations ended as people overheard the question and joined in. Among them was Myrta Alvarado. " I noticed his eyes, " she recalled recently. " They were kind eyes. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her four daughters from a previous marriage, now 34, 28, 24 and 19. Family members said he treated his stepdaughters as if they were his own children. Three years ago, Mayra Leitner, his eldest stepdaughter, confided in him. " I just felt like everything was going wrong, " she recalled. " He said there were people in worse situations than I was and I should always think of them. " <p> After being laid off by an insurance company in Westchester County, he was unemployed for four years, and earned money by working as a temp. By waking up early to work the phones, send resumes and contact headhunters, Mr. Gschaar, 55, who lived in Spring Valley, N.Y., made pursuing a full-time job a job in itself, his wife said. <p> Mr. and Mrs. Gschaar were overjoyed in July 2001 when he was hired by Aon, the insurance company at 2 World Trade Center. They began planning their first vacation in years. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September of this year. <p> ROBERT McMAHON Great Do-It-Yourselfer <p> When he was n't busy battling flames, Robert McMahon, 35, whom everyone called Bobby, liked to make things. He built a haunted house for children with cancer. He painted landscapes and loved photography. He could turn mute lumber into furniture of distinction. <p> Over at the Gate, a bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, there is a set of benches that he created for a friend, " beautiful, churchlike benches, " said Julie McMahon, his wife and the mother of their two sons, Matthew, 2, and Patrick, 4 months old. Together they bought the house in Queens that he grew up in, and he pulled it apart and created a vastly improved version. " And he had never done that before, " Mrs. McMahon said. <p> At his firehouse, Ladder Company 20 on Lafayette Street, he was the one who set up the Christmas tree every year, stringing it with lights. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates and gratitude all around. He could put together a company-size pan of lasagna so impressive that somebody once slipped the recipe to GQ. <p> " I used to call him MacGyver, " said his friend Mike Hopkins, who worked with him for eight years, " because he pretty much could do anything. If he did n't know how to do something, he would do it anyway, and he would do it really well. " <p> ABDOULAYE KONE Living the American Dream <p> By developing a passion for his craft and never losing sight of his desire to help his family, Abdoulaye Kone worked his way from a clay hut in Ivory Coast to the lofty heights of the World Trade Center, where he was a pastry chef at Windows on the World. " When he first came to this country he was working at a little five-and-dime store, " said his wife, Celestine Kone. " He wanted to be successful and probably open up his own business. " <p> Mr. Kone went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a very, very sophisticated and educated guy, " Mrs. Kone said, listing the languages he learned after the Mandingo and French that he spoke in Africa : English, Spanish, German, a little Italian. <p> His pastry creations were made to be eaten, but he preserved a photographic record of them in a big binder that Mrs. Kone has saved. <p> He sent money home to Ivory Coast, and was fond of saying that he worked for his son, Lacina, 8, and daughter, Mama, 5. On his rare days off, Mr. Kone, who lived in the Bronx, spent time taking the children out, sometimes to museums and once to the Statue of Liberty, but more often than not, he took them to see his friends, chefs at other restaurants. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 22, 2002 <p> CORRECTION : <p> A biographical sketch on Sunday about a World Trade Center victim, Stuart S.
