3051441 <p> In " Heir to an Execution, " an intimate new documentary about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, filmmaker Ivy Meeropol dangles the religion card, but does n't play it. The Rosenbergs ' Judaism unquestionably factored into the U.S. government 's controversial decision to execute the couple in 1953 as co-conspirators spying for the Soviet Union. <p> Meeropol chose to focus on a far more personal story of the Rosenbergs, the grandparents she never knew, and touchingly reconstructs their lives through interviews with their friends and family members. " Heir " also examines the impact of the Rosenbergs ' untimely death -- both were in their mid-30s, the age Meeropol is now -- on the two young sons they left behind, not knowing what would become of them. <p> One of those children, Michael Meeropol, is the director 's father. Ivy and Michael Meeropol will attend the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival 's screenings of " Heir to an Execution " on July 28 at the Castro Theatre and Aug. 1 at UC Berkeley 's Wheeler Auditorium. <p> " When I was making the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish film, ' but it obviously has got real legs in the Jewish community, " said Ivy, who regularly receives invitations to Jewish film festivals around the world, including in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. <p> For San Francisco Jewish Film Festival Executive Director Peter Stein and programmer Nancy Fishman, " Heir to an Execution " was an obvious choice to include among the festival 's 42 films. " We are living in an era in which we are in the midst of a struggle between weighing individual rights against national interest, " Stein said. " We live with the constant threat of that balance tipping. " The Rosenberg documentary allows the festival to " look backward 50 years to another time in American history in which that balance was tipped to the extreme. " <p> Fishman added that " Heir " is one of several films to be shown that examine " the experience of anti-Semitism and assimilation or just acculturation of people who came before you. You can look back at the generation of your parents or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " post-feminist and postliberation of the ' 60s. It 's a production of this generation. Ethel Rosenberg might not have been able to imagine that her granddaughter would be a filmmaker. " Fishman paused for a moment before amending her words. " Well, Ethel might have been able to. " One of many humanizing facts about Ethel Rosenberg revealed in the film is her aspiration to be an opera singer. <p> When Ivy speaks to Jewish audiences, the question frequently comes up of why her documentary does n't dwell more on the anti-Semitism her grandparents faced. <p> " That was a tough choice I had to make to focus the film, " she said. " I felt like it was too big a subject to tackle. I do n't believe that my grandparents were executed because they were Jewish, but I do think it played a role in how out of control things got. " <p> The judge in the case was Jewish, as were two of the government prosecutors. For one, Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an illustrious career. <p> " They were clamoring to get this case, " Ivy says. " It was an opportunity for Jews very interested in assimilating as fast as possible to distinguish themselves as the good Jews. " They wanted to be seen as different from Jews like the Rosenbergs who relished their ethnic background. In the documentary, one friend describes the Rosenbergs as " so Jewish, you could smell the pickled herring on them. " <p> Ivy 's extensive research turned up a " real effort " by the government to " make that link between Jew Commie and spy. When you read my grandparents ' letters, you can tell they were aware they were being used in that way and that they were n't going to let that happen. " <p> The lingering effect of the case on the public imagination is evident in a scene in Tony Kushner 's " Angels in America " where a ghostly Ethel Rosenberg comes to gloat over Cohn as he lies dying of AIDS in a hospital bed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen, " Ivy said, referring to the recently televised HBO production of " Angels. " " I could n't believe how much she looked like my grandmother. " <p> Michael Meeropol and his brother, Robert, came out in public as the Rosenbergs ' children in the 1973 book " We Are Your Sons. " Michael believed then and continues to believe that his parents being Jewish marginalized them and had a negative impact on the way Americans saw them. <p> " They could be seen as ' the other, ' " he said. " The fact that they were Jews set them up as archetypal traitors and forced many other Jews who might have been sympathetic at least on the death sentence to shy away and be afraid to say anything. " <p> Like his daughter, however, Michael is careful not to overplay the religion issue. " My parents were not arrested because they were Jewish but because they were Communists. " <p> Until the publication of the so-called Verona papers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' complete innocence. These documents, which the U.S. government acquired from the Soviet KGB, reveal that Julius Rosenberg did spy for the Russians, though he did not steal the secret to the atomic bomb, the crime he was convicted of. But Ethel Rosenberg appears to have done nothing except refuse to rat on her husband or implicate other people. <p> Ivy recalled phoning her father and uncle when this new information was released. They all attempted to decipher what it meant. Ivy, who was living in Washington, D.C., at the time working as a legislative assistant, attended a conference there with her father conducted by the CIA 's Center for Intelligence Studies. <p> " These young CIA agents were acting like they were at a football rally, saying, ' See, they were guilty. ' It was very upsetting, and I could see my father was pretty shaken. But if the Verona stuff is true, it indicates that Ethel was n't doing anything because( the Soviets) did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have been given the death penalty. " <p> This raises the question of why her grandmother allowed herself to be electrocuted, orphaning her two boys. " That is the question I wanted to know, " Ivy said. " What was worth standing up for so much? I came to understand that both Julius and Ethel believed that by standing up to the government plan for them, they were going to leave a greater legacy for their kids than if they had been acquitted. It is remarkable especially for Ethel. But she would have had to name other people, and I think she was physically incapable of doing so. " <p> Ivy never refers to them as her grandfather and grandmother -- terms she reserved for Anne and Abel Meeropol, the loving and, yes, left-leaning couple who adopted Michael and Robert when none of the boys ' relatives came forward. <p> " The Rosenbergs were the same iconic figures to me that they were to everyone else, " she said. " Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them. I would feel angry at them. I could n't help looking at it through the point of view of my father because he 's the one I care about. But I now understand that they were faced with a terrible choice and they made the only choice they could for them.
