At the behest of his son, Jorgito, it comes in cool colors. <p> From rubber heart models that guide surgeries at Children 's Hospital &amp; Medical Center to prosthetic hands produced by an Omaha researcher, three-dimensional printing for medical purposes is exploding. <p> The technology is popping up in numerous ways in the region, benefiting education, practice and treatment. Among the highest aims for 3-D printing is the creation of human organs, which remains a long way from reality. <p> " I think right now there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where things actually settle out, " said Dr. Justin Cramer, an assistant professor of neuroradiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. <p> Local researchers are exploring the use of 3-D printers for safely degradable surgical screws and plates and models of skeleton and blood vessel systems for practice and guidance during procedures. Children around the world have benefited from prosthetic hands made less expensive by 3-D printing. <p> One way local physicians have already deployed 3-D printing is by mapping out a body part so they can see what they are up against. <p> Physicians at Children 's Hospital in Omaha this spring wanted to see -- and touch -- a precise replica of 6-year-old Caid Loose-Ives ' deformed, defective, repaired and re-repaired heart. This time the heart had a small hole in it that had to be fixed. <p> Using a CT scan, the appropriate computer technology and their new 3-D printer, Gabe Linke produced a rubbery copy of Caid 's heart. Linke, a radiologic technologist, had recently been hired as 3-D printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific patient heart, " said Dr. Scott Fletcher, a pediatric cardiologist involved in Caid 's care. In this case, the 3-D model " certainly helped guide us as we went to block off " the hole, he said. <p> Caid and his parents marveled at the model of the complex organ that has given the boy so much trouble. Caid, of Council Bluffs, held it and looked it over. <p> " I just thought it was amazing, " said Caid 's mother, Jamie. " It 's so futuristic, you know? " <p> Children 's typically prints models of hearts that are unusually complex. Doctors there also have created some replicas of conventional cases so they can use them for the education of medical students, doctors and families. <p> The printer cost the hospital about $75,000, which was supplied by a foundation. Linke said it costs about $300 to print a normal-size heart and less for a small one, such as a newborn 's strawberry-size heart. <p> At Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heart to a 3-D model, which can be manipulated and turned on the screen. Then it 's imported again to software that connects to the printer. The printing process can take hours to complete -- one of the drawbacks of 3-D printing. <p> Linke recently created a heart model for educational purposes, and it required putting down 2,300 layers of rubberized material and five hours to print. <p> Dr. Chris Wilkinson, an orthopedic surgeon in Kearney, is one of several surgeons in Nebraska and Iowa who in some cases use a total knee replacement implant from a Massachusetts company that relies in part on 3-D printing. <p> By using a CT scan of a patient 's knee, the company, ConforMIS, creates a 3-D-printed wax mold to build an implant that is supposed to fit the patient precisely. <p> Wilkinson, who does about 150 total knee replacements a year, said he uses the ConforMIS knee half the time. Other patients go with a conventional device, from which one of about 10 available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better-fitting device will be less likely to cause discomfort. Wilkinson likes the ConforMIS knee but is n't certain yet that it produces better outcomes. The cost of both options is about the same and health insurance reimburses both, Wilkinson said. <p> " It looks very promising, but we do n't have 20 years ' worth of results, " he said. <p> A University of Nebraska at Omaha professor designed a prosthetic hand three years ago that can be made for as little as $50 with a 3-D printer. The professor, Jorge Zuniga, said he heard a National Public Radio story about South African inventors dabbling with 3-D printing for prosthetics and went to work on a hand for kids who ca n't afford conventional prosthetic devices. <p> Initially Zuniga, whose Ph.D. is in human physiology, wanted to make a flesh-colored lifelike hand. But his son, Jorgito, who was 4 at the time, suggested children would prefer a colorful hand that looked like one from Transformers. <p> Zuniga, who recently moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed the hand on his computer, then converted it to a file from which it could be printed. <p> He wrote a manual for how to make the hand, called the Cyborg Beast, and put it online two years ago, free for anyone to use. The Cyborg Beast was named by MSN.com one of the top inventions in 2014. <p> An organization called e-NABLE, which strives to get 3-D-printed prosthetics for free to people in need, said through an email that there are " a few hundred folks out there in the world " using the Cyborg Beast. <p> Zuniga said he also has worked with a physical rehabilitation organization in his native Chile to begin producing the 3-D-printed hands for children there. <p> The 3-D printers can cost as little as a few hundred dollars and as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars. Depending on the machine, 3-D printing can use plastics, metals and other materials. <p> Fletcher and others wonder about the possibility of " bioprinting, " in which human cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> UNMC 's Cramer said it 's early in the process and that scientists are " trying to figure out how to lay down tissue, keep it alive, and then put it in the body. " Institutions such as Wake Forest University are working on the concept. The university 's school of medicine cautioned that it 's still experimental. <p> A group of students at UNMC last year started a club, UNMC Makers, to explore the potential of 3-D printing. With the support of UNMC and its McGoogan Library, the club has a room and three small printers. <p> Among other projects, they have made their own research lab equipment, such as small racks for lab tubes and microscope slide racks at a fraction of the cost they would pay a company for those items. <p> Tyler Scherr, a doctoral student from South Dakota who founded the club, said they can build their own microscope with a 3-D printer for about $2, many times less than it could be bought at a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point and give microscopes to local schools. <p> Children 's Hospital 's Fletcher said he hopes his hospital can collaborate with other organizations to create models of kidneys or bladders or facial abnormalities and injuries. " We 're at the early stages of 3-D printing and its early application, " Fletcher said. <p> UNMC 's Cramer said the potential seems great. " Everybody is dazzled by it right now, too. " <h> Researchers go 3-D <p> Other medical enterprises using 3-D printing in Nebraska and Iowa include : <p> Dr. John Cote <p> CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD <p> Dr. John Cote of CHI Health in Omaha has made 3-D faces of fetuses from ultrasounds, primarily as keepsakes for parents at this point. Cote, an OB-GYN specialist, said he can envision using the technology to prepare parents for newborns with cleft lips and other deformities. <p> Michael Sealy, assistant professor of mechanical and materials engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is doing research on safely degradable surgical screws and plates made of magnesium and printed by 3-D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said he will print whole systems of blood vessels to test with plastic replicas whether a balloon procedure can be used without the benefit of X-ray guidance. He will test whether the balloon can be inserted by combat medics and paramedics in remote locations to prevent a patient from bleeding to death. <p> A University of Iowa program for medical, law, engineering and business students used a 3-D printer to make prototypes for a pump and belt needed to treat a collapsed bowel in children. Biomedical engineering student Claire Castaneda, a senior from Dubuque, Iowa, said the students in the Iowa Medical Innovation Group hope to license one of their inventions. <p> Dr. Michael Wadman, associate dean for graduate medical education at UNMC, is producing portions of skeletons with 3-D printing so students and professionals can practice splinting and fracture care. <p> Manny the goat with the first iteration of his prosthetic new leg. An Omahan is working on a replacement. <p> Reagan D. Pufall, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prosthetic leg for a goat named Manny from Firth, Nebraska, by using a 3-D printer. Pufall said the plastic leg cost about $90 to make but broke during the first week Manny used it. Pufall now is putting a metal rod into a new plastic prosthetic for Manny.
