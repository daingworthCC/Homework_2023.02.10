3070541 <p> A groundbreaking program to prepare select Colorado prison " lifers " for a chance at freedom hit a snag just before its unveiling last week, highlighting the often delicate balance between victims ' rights and corrections reform. <p> The program, called Lifeline after its Canadian prototype, identifies lower-risk inmates serving life sentences under older state laws. Lifers already released and doing well on the outside will mentor them through a six-month to one-year curriculum aimed at readying them for community corrections and parole review. <p> But the initial group of six candidates was quickly trimmed to four in the wake of objections from victim advocates and law enforcement officials familiar with two of the cases. <p> Those inmates - Michael Corbett and John Huckleberry - slipped through an initial screening but were removed from consideration after the Colorado Department of Corrections ' victim services department red-flagged them, said Tim Hand, assistant director of adult parole and community corrections and Lifeline 's driving force. <p> " Being victim-sensitive is part of the mission, " Hand said, noting that those concerns will continue to be weighed as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted to Islam in 1981 and changed his name to Hasani Chinangwa, was a soldier at Fort Carson convicted of three 1975 murders in Colorado Springs. Corrections officials say he has been a model prisoner, but his victims ' relatives and those who caught and convicted him have strenuously opposed parole. <p> Bob Russel, the now-retired district attorney who tried Corbett, said that in some particularly cold-blooded cases - and Corbett ranks at the top of his list - rehabilitation must take a back seat to punishment. <p> " I 'm not opposed to the( Lifeline) concept, " Russel said. " I 'm just certain there are some people that they dare not select. If they want to save the program, they 'd better be careful who they try to pick. " <p> No chance for parole <p> Huckleberry was convicted in the 1983 murder of his wife, who was run over and crushed by a truck in Colorado Springs. Authorities said he killed her for insurance money - just one element of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He, too, got life. <p> " I understand what the DOC is trying to do, " said Dick Reisler, the retired detective who helped put Huckleberry away and registered his objections on behalf of the victim 's family. " You ca n't put everybody in jail and throw away the key. And at some point, he may be a harmless old man. But not at this point. He 's an absolute sociopath. " <p> Since 1990, life sentences in Colorado have offered no chance for parole. For Lifeline, Hand and his staff drew from inmates sentenced under previous laws and narrowed the search to men who are at least 45 years old, have served 20 years of their sentence and have a good institutional track record. <p> Sex offenders are n't eligible. <p> Colorado is the first state to attempt such a model, which has drawn praise from some corrections experts based on its 15-year run in Canada. <p> At a meeting Monday, Hand announced four lifers who came through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Camp George West within the next 45 days. If successful, they 'll be presented to the community corrections board. If approved, they 'll enter a prerelease phase at the DOC 's Cheyenne Mountain facility. <p> All are serving life sentences for murder : Dennis Prentiss, 54, was convicted on two counts in Jefferson County ; Ricky Orr, 52, was sentenced in Denver ; Douglas Schlegel, 50, was convicted and sentenced in Larimer County ; and Condie Velasquez, 54, committed his crime in Denver. <p> The program does n't guarantee parole or release into the community. Those steps would first have to be approved by the state parole board or community corrections board, where victims ' families and others can testify. <p> But it does seek to make these lifers viable candidates. <p> " Frankly, lifers - those serving time for murder cases - tend to be the most compliant offenders we get out of our system, as opposed to drug addicts, thieves and criminal thinkers, " Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment, and 35 years later they 're still in prison. " <p> " Core group " will mentor <p> Colorado has 44 inmates currently serving sentences of 10 years to life, 140 serving 20 years to life and 245 serving 40 years to life. <p> On average, taxpayers spend more than $26,000 per year on each inmate, according to a 2004 DOC report. <p> " It comes down to grabbing your calculator at some point, " said Hand, 45, who has 21 years ' experience in corrections work. <p> But retired Colorado Springs homicide detective Lou Smit, who also worked the Corbett case, does n't see the value in a program that releases killers. <p> " I 've stood over too many dead bodies, " Smit said. " I 've witnessed the devastation this causes families and loved ones. My personal opinion is very strong : They should serve the time they got. " <p> The Lifeline program will use as mentors a " core group " of lifers doing well since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of rules prohibiting association among felons, but has been shown in the Canadian model to pay dividends. <p> " What they need is not a 35-year-old guy with a badge telling them what to do, " Hand said. " They need an old con to say, ' Quit playing the game. " ' <p> Anne Rogers, a board member of the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance and founder of Restorative Solutions, called Lifeline " an excellent idea " - particularly because it does not guarantee parole. <p> " All the victims I 've worked with, one of their highest priorities is they do n't want to see what happened to them happen to another human being, " Rogers said. " They want them to either not get out or, if they do, make sure they can function in society. To have people come out with no skills, no ability to survive, puts them right back into a life of crime. " <p> Success on the mind <p> Dianne Tramutola-Lawson, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since learning of it at a 1999 corrections conference in Denver, applauded the DOC for attempting such a politically risky effort. <p> " I admire them for their courage, " she said. " There are going to be people critical that someone serving life is out here at all. " <p> Her husband, parolee Hayward " Habe " Lawson, has been meeting with five other lifers for more than a year as part of the core group of mentors. With Hand, they have cobbled together a curriculum aimed at helping offenders find work and adapt to everything from freedom itself to mind- boggling technological changes. <p> At last week 's meeting, five of the six members of the core group offered their thoughts to corrections officials. <p> " These men will see that there 's people who have made it, who have done well, " said Willie McGregor, now a college student and one of the lifers who will serve as a mentor. " And the challenge is great for us core members. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to succeed. " <p> James Thorpe, another core member, said the dangers of substance abuse and victim awareness must be stressed. <p> " As long as those things are kept in the forefront of an individual 's mind, it plays a key role, " Thorpe said. " It humbles you. It keeps you in check. I do n't want these guys to come out with the illusion that they 're free. " <p> While some long-term inmates have no interest in Lifeline, Hand said, word of the program has affected attitudes of many parole-eligible lifers once resigned to no possibility of release. <p> " Now, I 've got letters( expressing interest), " he said. " And everyone 's signing up for classes, they 're into anger management, they 're putting their best foot forward. In three, five, eight years, maybe there 's a chance for them to be productive.
