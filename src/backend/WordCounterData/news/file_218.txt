3041741 <p> As the world 's best athletes converge on Atlanta, children around the globe will be watching their performances. <p> Sometimes, children even try to pattern their lives after the sports figures they admire. <p> Don Richter, assistant professor of Christian education at Emory University, has studied the role of athletic competition in the lives of children. He has written papers on athletic competition for girls and, most recently, on " The Moral Value of Sports : Lessons for the Church. " <p> Richter also is director of the Youth Theology Institute, a four- week, ecumenical summer academy for 72 high school students held at Emory University. Richter recently reflected on the role of sports in culture with staff writer Gayle White. <p> Q : Is sports replacing religion or becoming a religion? A : That 's what Pierre de Coubertin, the modern Olympic founder, was really pointing toward when he revived the Olympics. Sports would pave the way toward a new kind of religion that would be... based not on sectarian tribalisms or individual historic traditions but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> De Coubertin was very consciously trying to invest the Olympics with religious ritual. <p>... The march into the arena is like a religious processional. The committee is like the high priests. The Olympic oath is like a purifying rite. The space in which the games take place is supposed to be sacred. The victory ceremony is supposed to be an homage to the nations. <p> It 's really a time of looking toward the future. There 's a great emphasis on human progress and the capacity to transcend the limitations of the past. <p> Q : What about not just the Olympics, but sports in general? <p> A : Parents find in sports the respect for discipline, the appreciation for apprenticing oneself to skilled practitioners, a respect for the boundaries of competition. <p> I do n't think parents are consciously saying, " I 'm going to take my kid to soccer as a substitute for going to the Methodist church on the corner. " But I think there is an appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in conventional Christian education programs or conventional congregational nurture. <p> People are turning toward organized sports to help the formation of moral character in the way they would turn to Sunday schools 100 years ago. <p> Q : But sports fosters competition. Is that good? <p> A : There 's an acknowledgment that life is competitive. Our social structures, our economies, all involve competition. In the Cold War, capitalism won. <p> Not only do we need to learn how to win, we need to learn how to lose gracefully. While we have our doubts about the healthfulness of competition, I think we all realize how competitive life is. We find that sports offers a safe space in which young people can learn the skills of competition they will need for life. <p> Q : In sports you have referees and umpires who blow the whistle when you step outside the boundaries. It 's often much harder to decide in real life whether you 're breaking the rules, is n't it? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylized world in some ways. Life outside sports sometimes seems a lot messier. But even in the world of sports sometimes, athletes get away with things - a thrown elbow, an illegal defense. People can still cheat and get away with it. <p> Q : And we sometimes cheer players who get away with things. What does that say about society? <p> A : I think people who really have respect for the game may feel happy that their man was called safe when he was actually thrown out, but another part of them knows you got away with something here. They acknowledge that. <p> When I 'm at a game, I wo n't get as upset if it 's the Braves player that got the break, but I 'm aware that somebody got away with something. <p> Q : Does it taint the victory if it 's won on spurious grounds? <p> A : A lot of us feel the calls will balance out in the end, but it certainly does raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone got away with something. <p> Part of what we believe in is the moral world of that particular sport. We have a confidence people ought to win fairly. I think it does violate our sense of justice, even if our team is the winner. I think most fans would admit that. <p> Q : How bad is it when sports figures act immorally? <p> A : Parents initiate their kids into sports because they feel there will be some transferability of the virtues they learn in sports to other areas of their life as well - courage and prudence and justice and patience. And so it grieves us when we find that sports figures are not practicing those same virtues off the court or off the field as we expect them to practice on the court and on the field. It points toward a disjunction, toward a lack of integrity in their characters. <p> Q : What can other institutions, such as religious institutions, learn from sports? <p> A : We can ask what practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this kind of compelling property sports seems to have. We have not often portrayed the life of faith in those terms - in terms of particular practices. The nearest we get to that is when we talk about spiritual disciplines. <p> But the way I 'm viewing this really extends beyond disciplines - which may seem very individualistic, whereas social practices have a definite corporate dimension to them. <p> If you take the practice of prayer, for instance : We need to be asking how does our congregation engage in the practice of prayer. Who are the skilled pray-ers in our community? How can we apprentice ourselves with them? What is the range of this practice within our congregation? <p> The disciples of Jesus asked him to teach them to pray and he did give them some instruction on how to do that. I think we need to be prepared to give people basic instruction on the skills and habits of a life of prayer. <p> Q : What are some ways parents can use sports most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think that parents need to help children understand the larger social context of the sport, which goes beyond just the game that will be played on Saturday morning. <p> They need to introduce their children to heroes within that particular sport. They need to take an active interest in how children are experiencing their participation in sport. Sports does n't come easily for all children. <p> Sports gives us as parents an opportunity to encourage and affirm our children even when they do n't perform well, even when they may be failures. <p> Q : What sports do you play? <p> A : I played high school tennis and basketball, and I also life- guarded a lot during high school. I 'm still an avid tennis player and swimmer. <p> Q : How has this influenced you? <p> A : For one thing, sports is a wonderful physical and psychological release for me. When I play tennis, whether I win or lose the match, I can immerse myself in a physical activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a kind of predictability that is far different from my day-to-day routines.
