3048541 <p> Human-rights crusader Harry Wu became an international cause celebre last summer, when he was detained by Chinese officials at a remote crossing on China 's border with Kazakhstan. The detention and subsequent arrest of Wu, an American citizen, became the subject of a diplomatic stand-off between the United States and China, with China insisting he had broken Chinese laws and U.S. officials calling for his immediate release. <p> In August, Wu was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison. But immediately following the trial, he was allowed to leave the country. The next day, First Lady Hillary Clinton announced she would travel to Beijing to attend the Fourth World Conference on Women. <p> Even before he found himself a pawn on a diplomatic chess board, Wu had devoted years of his life to exposing the injustices of China 's penal system. A visiting scholar at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution, he wrote several books, worked on documentaries about the laogai, China 's labor camp system, and testified before Congress numerous times. <p> Wu 's passion for shining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 19 years he spent in a labor camp as punishment for criticizing the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. His commitment lived on after he came to the United States in 1985. <p> Now a resident of Milpitas, Wu says that since he returned home last year he has only rested for two days. He has lectured at grammar schools, high schools and colleges and has received a number of awards in the United States and Europe. He is currently working on a book about his experiences in China last year. <p>. <p> Q : When Chinese officials arrested you last year, they said it was because of the BBC documentary you made with reporter Sue Roberts in 1994, alleging that the government was taking organs from prisoners who were about to be executed. What happened on that trip? <p> A : In Chengdu( Sichuan province) we went to the hospital to work on the organ story. We said we were a married couple. I said my uncle had a kidney problem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We inquired about the conditions, how much it would cost. We got it all on camera. <p> The Chinese government says I tricked them, told lies. Of course Sue Roberts is n't my wife. Of course I do n't have an uncle. If I did n't lie, I would n't have seen anything. There 's no question of that. <p>. <p> Q : Do you have any misgivings about the documentary? <p> A : No. But in 1994, there was something I had to work out in my own mind. I had so much footage -- from patients and officials to doctors and nurses -- they all told me about it. I also had Chinese government documents about how they remove the organs, how the hospital van can drive right up to the execution scene. <p> But I kept having this feeling. In Sichuan, I had gone into the hospital room. There were 10 patients there, all of them had just finished having kidney transplants. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients did n't have that long to live. So when the doctor came in, they were so grateful, they were so moved. <p> I thought, no matter what, this doctor had done a good thing -- he was saving people. The Chinese government had done something bad, but the doctor had n't. I was a little confused -- could I do this documentary? I also know that performing transplants is a special skill. For China 's medical schools to develop these skills, why would I want to hurt them? I asked BBC not to air the documentary right away. <p> I took a trip to Poland, to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, because Auschwitz had the problem of Hitler 's Nazi doctors. I got a feeling : If today you and I were standing outside the gates of Auschwitz, neither Nazis nor Jews, just outsiders, and every day we saw a hundred, maybe a thousand Jews going to the gas chamber. If at that point a German doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to find out how to save the lives of our Navy service men, our airmen. Can you give me a few Jews? They 're going to die anyway. " <p> You could say the doctor was n't responsible for their life or death, it was Hitler 's policy. Who 's to say that this way they would n't still have a chance to live? Maybe the doctor would have to give them a little better food to eat. <p> I stood there for a long time, thinking it over. When I got back, I called the BBC right away, and gave them the go-ahead. The Chinese doctors would have to be condemned. <p> A Chinese doctor said to me, " You have to understand, " he said, " It 's Chinese law that 's condemning them to die. We doctors have nothing to do with it. They 're bad people -- murderers, rapists, arsonists. " <p> There was another doctor, a Chinese doctor now in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night, his work unit contacted him to go out on a mission with some other doctors. He did n't know where they were going. As soon as he entered the room, he saw a patient who was already anaesthetized. He said his face was already covered, but he knew he was alive. <p> He took the two kidneys out, then put them in a container. He told me about it three times, I taped it three times. The last time I said, " I want to use this footage. " He would n't agree, no matter what. <p> Finally, I said, " You are a doctor. I want to ask you something : If a person has both his kidneys removed, how long can he live? " He said, " Just a few hours. He 'll definitely die, he has no chance of living. " I said, " Are you sure? " He said, " I am sure. " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. The next day 's execution did n't mean anything -- you already removed his kidneys. " <p>. <p> Q : You went back to China just after Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui visited Cornell University and U.S.- Sino relations began to sour, a couple of months before the U.N. women 's conference. Why did you pick that time? <p> A : When January 1995 came around, I still had n't thought about going back. I had just gone the year before, so there was no rush. But I started thinking about my next step. So I went to Houston, not San Francisco, to apply for a visa. I figured there was no way I could go. <p> After my return in 1991, the Chinese Communists had a black list of 49 names. My name was on it. In 1992 and 1993 I tried several times to get a visa. But they knew I was using a U.S. re-entry permit, they identified me and they would n't let me go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American citizen, so I had a legal passport and a new name -- Peter Wu. They did n't know. But by 1995, I had already used that passport once -- for the BBC trip. <p> I was surprised when they gave me the visa. I started talking it over. My friends said, " Do n't go. It 's dangerous. It 's a trap. " <p> I got my visa in February. I did n't go until June 19 -- more than four months later. On the one hand I was hesitating. On the other, I had to prepare for my security and plan. To do one of these operations is n't easy. <p> This had nothing to do with Mrs. Clinton, and it had nothing to do with Lee Teng-hui. I was independent, I was doing my own thing. " <p>. <p> Q : Why do you suppose they gave you the visa? <p> A : One possibility was they still did n't know about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a trap. The third was that they did know, and that the visa was an administrative mistake. <p> I thought through what would happen if they discovered me. The most likely scenario is that they would n't let me into the country at all. It never occurred to me that they would detain me. <p> Another possibility was that they would let me in and pretend they did n't know. Of course maybe they really did n't know, so I 'd have to be very careful not to let anybody say, " There 's Harry Wu. " I 'd stay in small hotels with the locals. <p> The other possibility was that they 'd let me in and secretly get rid of me. <p>. <p> Q : When did you know there was going to be trouble? <p> A : When we got to Horgas on the Chinese border, I saw the customs official, a young woman, entering something in her computer. I gave her my passport. As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong. Her eyes did n't look right. She told me to wait and went into an office. A moment later, her chief came out. I looked at the entrance, policemen were already standing there. <p>. <p> Q : What was the detention like? <p> A : Through the whole 66 days, there were no beatings, there were no scoldings, there were no 18-hour or 24-hour interrogations. From Horgas, we took a bus to Yining, from Yining, we took a plane to Urumqi. In Urumqi, we stayed in a high-class hotel, then went by car to Wuhan. There were seven cars ; it was a motorcade. I told a joke, I said it was like a visit from an African king. Fifty or 60 people were escorting me all the way to Wuhan! <p> They took me to a health recovery center for public security officers -- a big building on the side of a lake. The scenery and conditions were excellent. Every room had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Room 101. They had 18 young lieutenants, three in a group, six groups. They rotated -- each group spent three hours in my room. I 'd be sleeping -- they 'd be there. I 'd be reading -- they 'd be there. Twenty-four hours a day. I 'd go to the bathroom, they 'd watch me, take a shower, they 'd watch me. <p> On top of the 18, there were four supervisors. These 22 people had direct contact with me, but the 18 were n't allowed to talk to me. They never said a word, but they 'd listen. I 'd tell them, " I need medicine, " " I want water, " " I 'm not feeling well. " <p> I protested every day. I said, " You have to present an arrest warrant. " <p> On the morning of July 30, they presented a house arrest and asked me to sign it. I would n't sign it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen. I said I would n't sign it until I talked to my embassy. Number two, I asked, " What is the reason? " Number three : " What 's my status? I 've been in the People 's Republic of China for 11 days. Am I a tourist? A student? A businessman? Or a prisoner? What am I doing here? How did I get here? My status is n't clear. <p> " Besides, you said this is a house arrest, this is n't my house. House arrest means I 'm at home, I can write letters, use the phone, go out shopping. What are these people doing in my room? Can I go shopping? " <p>. <p> Q : They later arrested you formally and showed a taped confession. Why did you confess? <p> A : The things I 've done are n't wrong. I will keep doing them. There 's no question of that. I am facing 50 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1.5 million public security officers and secret police. I have no gun, no ammunition, no money, no people. I have to know how to fight. <p> I spent 19 years in China 's laogai system. From 1957 when they labeled me a rightist, I do n't know how many confessions I 've written. " I 'm a counterrevolutionary rightist. " " Long Live Chairman Mao! " " Long Live the Chinese Communist Party! " " I 'm willing to be reformed by the government. " <p> That 's how you survive in this system. I 'm very clear about it. But I 'll never give up. <p> In America, according to Western concepts, you 're innocent. In the laogai, who will say you 're innocent? <p>. <p> Q : What exactly did you confess to? <p> A : There was nothing that they did n't already know. Nobody was arrested because of my confession. The things they talked about -- the BBC, CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how funny it was? They said, " You 've been at the Hoover Institution all these years. What do they pay you? " As you know, they do n't pay me anything, they just give me a title. I told them $ 80,000. They went on for an hour : " Who 's the director of Hoover? " " John Raisian. " " Who else do you know? " " George Schulz. " You could say this is also a confession. <p> After an hour, they said, " It does n't matter. We already know that Hoover used to be the head of the FBI. " I almost told them, " Hoover also makes vacuum machines. " <p>. <p> Q : You have been vilified by some in the Chinese community for being too hard on China. <p> A : Yes, I am a traitor. I 'm a traitor to the Communists. I 'm honored to be a Communist traitor, because the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chinese people have a defect. They ca n't separate the government from the nation. No one has a choice about their motherland, but you have the right to choose the government you want. In the United States, you can oppose Clinton, oppose Bush, oppose any president, nobody will say you betrayed your government. <p> Because I love my motherland, that 's why I want to expose the ugly truth of the Communists. <p>. <p> Q : Since you were released from China last year, you 've been on the " Tonight Show, " you 're flying around the world to give speeches and win awards. Now you have a book contract. Some say you were really after money and fame all along. <p> A : If I were after money or fame, why would I risk my own life? It 's too dangerous. <p> I 've already endured so much in China. I could just stay here and write books, I do n't need to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested that I got so many speaking engagements and awards. Nobody can plan for that. <p> To become a public figure is exhausting. I do n't have any vacations. Every night I work until midnight. The nightmares are n't pleasant. How many more years do I have to live? I 'm a common person. I want to be loved, I want to be in love. I want a good car. I want a good house. I do n't have any children. I 've lost so many years. Why should I do this? I wish I could put it all behind me. <p>. <p> Q : So what keeps you going? <p> A : I represent millions of faceless, nameless people. They can not come over here and tell you their own story. I 'm talking about a very big thing -- concentration camps in Hitler 's Germany, gulags under Sta lin, and the laogai in Communist China. <p> Sure, a few foundations can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards are for human rights. This is what the Chinese government fears. It makes them nervous. That 's why they consider me a number one trouble-maker. I 'm talking about their system, the vilest, cruelest, darkest system of brutality. <p> Before 1974, " gulag " was not an English word. You could not find it in the English dictionary, and now you can. It means Soviet political violence, the Soviet labor camp system. Laogai should be an English word. That 's what I 'm fighting for. <p>. <p> Q : What about the argument that China deserves some credit for the political and economic reforms in China, that the economic development will make for a more free and democratic society? <p> A : This time when I was at the border, the customs officers were using computers. Before, they did n't have them. The police who were escorting me in China -- all of them had Motorola phones. Where did all this money come from? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest benefit? Other than Americans, the Japanese, the Taiwanese, the greatest beneficiary is the Chinese government. That 's why they have the money to buy Motorolas, to buy a British security system, to build advanced missiles. <p>. <p> Q : Will you go back? <p> A : As long as I have an opportunity, I 'll go back. They could n't stop me in the past, how can they stop me in the future? <p>. <p> Q : What about the 15-year sentence? <p> A : Was n't I already on the black list for years, and I still went back? I already spent 19 years locked up, 15 years is shorter. What 's so scary? This is my motherland. This piece of land is full of my blood and tears. <p> HARRY WU <p> * 1937 : Born Wu Hongda February 8 in Shanghai, China. <p> * 1955 : Attended Beijing College of Geology. <p> * 1960 : Arrested as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticisms of the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. <p> * 1979 : Released along with other political prisoners following Deng Xiaoping 's rise to power. <p> * 1985 : Traveled to the United States as a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. <p> * 1988-present : Visiting scholar /research fellow at Hoover Institution. <p> * 1992 : Founded Laogai Foundation. <p> * 1992 : Published " Laogai : The Chinese Gulag.
