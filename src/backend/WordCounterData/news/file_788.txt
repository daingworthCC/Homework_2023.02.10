5017141 <p> This unusual house in Birmingham is tucked into a setting that 's especially beautiful and secluded, yet it 's just walking distance to the city 's downtown. <p> It 's set so far back that from the street you barely notice the building. You see a long brick driveway that reaches much farther back than the neighbors ' homes around it. Then you see just this house 's most narrow end -- the width of a two-car garage. Above it a second story has an arched window and a Juliet, or false, balcony. <p> Spiral stairs to upstairs bedrooms in this unique Birmingham 3 bedroom 4.5 bath home set back off of the street with a lush landscaped driveway, is listed at $1,199,500 photographed Tuesday, June 18, 2019.

Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press <p> From that narrow starting point the house stretches back another 90 feet. Where the building ends -- with a covered rear porch -- the long, slim yard stretches out behind it. <p> The landscapes are intense in both the deep front yard and the deep rear yard. In front, it 's made up of extensive brick paving, specimen trees like Japanese maple and curving beds shaped by dozens of boxwoods with groundcover. <p> In the rear, that blooms into an extensive perennial garden, again with brick paving and scores of boxwood to shape flower beds. You see a full season worth of future blooms -- peonies in bloom right now with big stands of phlox and black-eyed Susans getting ready to kick in. <p> " There 's always something beautiful you can look at as the season progresses, " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from master suite in this unique Birmingham 3 bedroom 4.5 bath home set back off of the street with a lush landscaped driveway, is listed at $1,199,500 photographed Tuesday, June 18, 2019.( Photo : Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press) <p> The paved and manicured back garden looks suited to lounging and entertaining, but far out back an open area of grass is left natural, roughly big enough for a badminton game. <p> Although this is a street of narrow city lots, this yard is very private. On all sides it 's wrapped with a decorative iron fence. Inside that, rows of slender evergreens make privacy more intense. Also, being placed so far back from the street offsets this spot from the neighbors ' yards. <h> Interior is elegant <p> So much for this home 's unusual setting. Its interior is just as elegant, and interior finishes are rich. The butler 's pantry for example has dark wood cabinets like the kitchen., glass-front display doors and duplicate appliances. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with automatic switches.

Originally the lot was 35 feet wide and 271 feet deep. That meant the first version of this house was just 21 1/2 feet wide. <p> But a previous owner and the next door neighbor split an empty lot between them. So the lot expanded a little and allowed a long, slim addition down the side of the house. Now much of the house is 35 feet wide. That extra space let owners add a new main entrance, butler 's pantry, den-office and back porch. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown Birmingham. The main house was first built to 21 1/2 feet wide, then expanded with the side addition to 35 feet wide after an owner expanded the lot. The house is 90 feet long and set back farther from the street than most neighbors.( Photo : Square Tangerine Productions) <p> Though this house is long, it is not dark. Big arching windows on both floors allow a lot of natural light. The greatroom and the owners ' suite above it each have two glass sliding doors with two Juliet balconies for generous exposure to the rear yard. <p> These owners now feel the pull of the Detroit, and they 're having a home built in Midtown. It 's not easy though to leave what the husband called " this secluded haven.
