3046341 <p> " For the strong, the intelligent, the healthy, the successful, those on whom, just because they are so, falls the duty of understanding weakness, stupidity, disease and failure in order that they may cure them, Wagner 's operas are essential, a constant source of delight. They must listen to him. But who should never be allowed to listen to Wagner? The unhappy, the disappointed, the politically ambitious, the self-pitying, those who imagine themselves misunderstood, the Wagnerians. " <p> -- W.H. Auden <p> " Notes to New Year Letter " <p> That observation might have been the guiding text for last weekend 's symposium, " The Threat to the Cosmic Order : Psychological, Social and Health Implications of Wagner 's ' Ring of the Nibelung ' " held at the University of California at San Francisco. The two-day event at the School of Medicine presented 17 speakers and a panel of current and noted performers of the " Ring. " <p> Would they offer anything as unlikely as a fresh approach to Wagner? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and author of a psychiatric study of Robert Schumann ; a distinguished committee of six helped him. Backed to the hilt by UCSF Chancellor Julius R. Krevans, the symposium was part of the celebration of his campus ' 125th anniversary and an adjunct to the San Francisco Opera 's current " Ring " festival. <p> The eager registrants overflowed the auditorium into two adjoining classrooms for what was billed as the first conference to emphasize the medical, psychological and social issues raised by the " Ring. " <p> Despite their imposing titles, many of the presentations did not go much beyond reviewing well-known information about Wagner, the " Ring " and its implications, nor much below the surface of the medical, psychological and social issues. <p> More disquieting, two of the opening session 's talks got caught up in the humor of Wagner 's outrageous behavior and lifestyle. Once an audience begins laughing, its interest shifts direction ; to reach serious conclusions at the professional level is then out of the question. The event becomes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own entertainment values. <p> In " The Visual Wagner : Environments, Icons and Images, " art historian Alessandra Comini presented slides documenting the course of that imperious, self-indulgent life. <p> The monumental vanity reflected by the villas and their furnishings, the artifacts and apparel, was obvious. Wagner 's ego was evident in the paintings, sculptures, engravings and photos, in their subjects, source and Wagner 's placement of them. Although these images spoke for themselves, Comini took a satiric tone about this documentation, already known for over a century and joked about in Wagner 's lifetime. <p> It 's curious that no one laughs at descriptions of the lifestyle, personality and behavior of that other personage with whom Wagner has been linked across history, Adolf Hitler. A likely reason was offered by the eminent psychiatrist and scholar Friedrich C. Redlich. Wagner, though also a terrible human being, at least did not order the killing of innocent people, whatever he might have said in one of his rages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported National Socialism. David Large, discussing the opportunistic, changeable course of Wagner 's political stands, gave a convincing argument that Wagner would have been standing next to Hitler in Nuremberg stadium. Large, a sharp historian, titled his lecture " Richard Wagner and the Problem of German Identity. " <p> Wagner 's motive probably would not have been fueled by political belief, but by his appreciation for the glorification of himself, his operas and Bayreuth by Hitler. Redlich views Wagner 's fierce anti-Semitism as more complex than Hitler 's, which stemmed from different sources but certainly was confirmed and fanned by the composer 's racial hatreds. <p> Redlich acknowledged Wagner 's enormous influence on Hitler through music dramas, prose and the racist writings of the Bayreuth circle. <p> More interesting was Redlich 's description of their similarities -- they were both theatrical( clinically hysterical) personalities -- and their differences. " Hitler was erotically and sexually frustrated while Wagner was an immensely erotic man. " <p> Although some may have hoped to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emeritus of psychiatry at Yale and UCLA, he said he was opposed to that. " Both were unique personalities, and any analyses advanced so far have no explanatory value. " <p> Medical ideas about Wagner were skimpier than the symposium 's title and sponsorship would have led one to expect. <p> The lectures I missed dealt with psychological aspects revealed in the " Ring. " While that 's ground already heavily plowed, it 's safer than historical and speculative psychiatric analysis. Eric Plaut, professor of psychiatry at Northwestern, worked on " Dwarfs, Giants, Dragons and Other Body Distortions in Wagner 's Operas. " He drew connections between Wagner 's early exposure to violence, illness, paternity anxiety and wandering, and the wounds, deformations and temporal and spatial displacements in the music dramas. <p> George H. Pollock, also of the Northwestern medical faculty, dealt with Oedipal, incestuous, death and destruction themes in the " Ring " and their relationship to Wagner 's creative life and message. Sherwin H. Sloan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of one eye as the symbolic equivalent to castration( as in the interpretations of Sophocles ' " Oedipus Rex, " where it is in fact called Oedipism) and the loss of potency and power. <p> Any " Ring " lover acquainted with Jung 's theories and archetypal myth symbols in the collective unconscious would have felt at home with the presentation of psychiatry professor Jean Shinoda Bolen. It is her reasonable contention that in interpreting a god/goddess myth, a reader/viewer may sense the psychological import of it in terms of his/her own experience. <p> Bolen traced the " Ring " divinities and their psychological significance through the story. Along the way she made connections with their Greek equivalents. Wotan and Zeus are dominant males with wives( Fricka and Hera) and " archetypal father 's daughters "( Bruennhilde and Athena) and helpers( Loge and Hermes). <p> Like Athena 's mother, Metis, Bruennhilde 's mother, Erda, is a " pre-patriarchal goddess of wisdom. " In the " Ring, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting sleep, are perceived as representing eternal wisdom or Wotan 's subconscious. <p> Such interpretation( or deeper interpretation, as in Robert Donington 's " Wagner 's ' Ring ' and Its Symbols ") explains the universal response of audiences to the " Ring " as myth and endorses its genius as a literary conception. <p> Only touched on at the conference was Wagner 's more immediate myth-source, the medieval epic " Nibelungenlied. " Comini 's slides included Peter Cornelius ' engraved title page to the 1817 edition of the " Nibelungenlied, " vividly illustrating the story. It was literally an icon that Wagner had hanging over his writing desk wherever he lived. In a real, psychological sense, it could be said -- though nobody did last weekend -- that Wagner lived in his own world, a world of his own construction, of his own ego and of his own creative fantasy. He lived the " Ring " as he was fashioning it. The artifact images with which he surrounded himself are the localized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two most insightful lectures came in the last session. The first was a startling association made between Wagner 's dramatic use of the narrative process and Sigmund Freud 's use of it in dream analysis. The lecturer was David Levin, American-born Dramaturg at the Frankfurt Opera. <p> In his " The Interpretation of Dreams, " Freud described having the patient repeat his dream recitation. Freud meanwhile would be listening for any change in the narrative that would be a revelatory " weak spot " betraying the( psychological) truth. Freud himself then drew the analogy between that procedure and Hagen 's seeking to find out Siegfried 's vulnerable spot( in " Goetterdaemmerung "). In a procedure like Freud 's, Hagen then sets out to ambush the truth in Siegfried 's narration. <p> While such a vivid insight might not add to our grasp of the " Ring, " it 's another beam of light on Wagner 's intuitive intelligence, deepening our appreciation and understanding of the workings of that amazing mind. <p> Music itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process but it takes a keen musical analyst to penetrate and describe that. Anthony Newcomb of the UC Berkeley music faculty gave clear musical examples to demonstrate how Wagner, realizing that " psychological life was best represented as a continuing process of transformational change, " revolutionized musical form. <p> Wagner eliminated the literal repetitions and successions of closed structures fundamental to the musical tradition he inherited. Instead, his musical structures implied closure but then avoided it. The frustrating of that expectation gave his music the mobility, drama and realistic psychologically dynamic he sought, while maintaining comprehensibility. That is the source of the " secret " musical magic and power of Wagner, his Ring. <p> Newcomb 's lecture, close to the symposium 's conclusion, was the only serious musical discussion of the 17 presentations, much of whose material is readily available in the literature on Wagner. The medical people missed the point in planning their symposium. <p> It is in understanding the music, and the process that governs it, that we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over listeners -- as well as about the mind that created it.
