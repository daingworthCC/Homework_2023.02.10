3071341 <p> ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines - Roland Detaboli, a colonel in the Philippine army, chases ' ghosts ' through the tangled jungles of Basilan island. <p> ' You do n't get to see them very often, or for very long, ' he said of the militant Islamic sect hiding on the island just south of here. ' They are like ghosts. They just disappear. ' <p> Like finding a path through the thicket, the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism is a complicated affair in the Philippines, where people have both depended on and resented Americans, and conflicting politics are a way of life. <p> Detaboli and his elite Filipino Scout Rangers are hot on the steamy, overgrown trail of the Abu Sayyaf group, branded by the United States as a terrorist organization with ties to Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network. <p> There is a sense of urgency : Abu Sayyaf, which means ' bearer of the sword ' in Arabic, has a bloody history of bombings and decapitations, and its members are holding captive two Americans and a Filipina nurse kidnapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, ' Detaboli said. ' We know they are n't fooling around. ' <p> But the mangroves and vines, palm trees and waling-waling orchids grow so thick and snarled on this cluster of 7,107 scattered tropical islands as to be nearly impenetrable to the armed forces of the Philippines, who have pursued Abu Sayyaf and kindred militant spirits here for more than a decade. <p> ' It 's very difficult in there, ' Detaboli said. ' At a distance of only 5 or 10 meters, if you just stay put and do n't create any noise, you wo n't be observed. That is one way they hide. Another way is just to scatter, find shelter with their relatives, blend in with the community. ' <p> Besides the impossibly thick vegetation, soldiers on the three-month patrols chasing the group must deal with deadly snakes, scorpions, wilting heat and humidity, poor food and an unsympathetic local Muslim population historically persecuted in the Catholic-dominated Asian country. <p> Yet the biggest complaint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war on terrorism - is being outgunned by terrorists who have faster boats, deadlier weapons and more sophisticated communication devices. <p> So for the Filipino fighters, the presence of U.S. troops conducting joint training is a welcome boost, part of a $ 100 million military aid package that includes guns, communications gear and helicopters. <p> ' We have all the combat experience any commander could want, ' said Philippine army Capt. Montano Almodovar. ' They have more high-tech equipment than we do. That is the help we need. ' <p> ' A love-hate situation ' <p> Not everyone in the Philippines, once an American colony, shares his open-arms attitude toward the 660 visiting troops, however. <p> ' It 's definitely a love-hate situation, ' said one diplomat. ' We 're here at the invitation of the Philippine government, but certainly not everyone wants us here. ' <p> Political figures from both the left and the right have berated President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo for cozying up to the country known by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still indicate that the vast majority of Filipinos favor a limited U.S. presence, critics have been vocal, and even supporters have been guarded in their endorsement of the training exercises. <p> ' I think it 's good that they 're here to help, but, as I am a nationalist, I would like to see the Philippines solve its own problems, ' said Air Philippines employee Percival Ebbah Jr. ' We are a proud country, and we want to maintain our independence. ' <p> There are nearly daily protests outside the U.S. Embassy in Manila, just across a busy arterial road from a Starbucks coffee shop. <p> Signs declare : ' Yankees, Go Home! ' and ' No to U.S. military intervention. ' A man standing atop a van shouts feedback-distorted slogans into a megaphone as a mob of about 200 college-age people in jeans and Easton backpacks cheers periodically. <p> ' We 're protesting American imperialism. We hate the way the Americans come in here and boss us around, ' said Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked Marlboros. <p> Eventually, someone is likely to ignite a U.S. flag during the protests. <p> But the protests, however heartfelt, have a certain tropical ease about them in a country with a history of violent popular uprisings. <p> On the perimeter of the crowd, the police - equipped with the requisite helmets and riot shields - smoke cigarettes and chat casually with protesters, observers and each other. Vendors do brisk business selling iced fruit drinks and T-shirts emblazoned with the likeness of revolutionary Che Guevara. <p> ' This is not personal. Of course the Americans are our friends, ' said Rose Deblois, a member of a protest group of government employees called Courage. ' We are angry about the politicians and the policies involved here. ' <p> Like many Filipinos, she worries that the Americans have ' ulterior motives, ' such as re-establishing a permanent military presence in the region after withdrawing at the request of the Philippine government 10 years ago. <p> ' The Filipino people suffered because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials gave us skin diseases. They used our women, and they left their bastard children behind to be beggars. Even today, there are bombs that explode that were left behind by the U.S. military. We do n't want them back. ' <p> Only a terrorism battle <p> American officials, on the other hand, offer reassurances that they are interested only in cracking down on terrorists worldwide, not looking to gain a toehold in the strategically desirable Philippines. <p> ' The United States has no interest in establishing military bases in the Philippines, ' U.S. Army Gen. Donald Wurster, head of the training operations, said bluntly last week. <p> Instead, U.S. officials contend that the region simply marks the next battlefield in a global, systemic approach to defeating terrorism. <p> With communist insurgents in the north - late last month, American Brian Thomas Smith was killed on the slopes of Mount Pinatubo, supposedly by members of the leftist New People 's Army - and Islamic extremists such as Abu Sayyaf in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So it should have come as little surprise when Arroyo contacted President Bush only hours after the Sept. 11 attacks on America and offered the full support of the Philippines, the first Asian country to join the international coalition. <p> But the move spawned the resentment of nationalists, who wondered aloud where the Americans had been during the 10 years the Philippines had been battling terrorism internally. <p> Actually, U.S. forces have participated in joint military training with the Philippines annually, including July, when it trained Scout Rangers in anti-terrorism techniques specifically aimed at Abu Sayyaf. <p> A month earlier, in June, Abu Sayyaf operatives decapitated Californian Guillermo Sobero as an Independence Day ' gift ' to Arroyo. <p> Although notable for its grisly nature, the slaying marked just another act of brutality in a chilling outbreak of terrorism in paradise. <p> For years, Abu Sayyaf and a sibling organization called the ' Pentagon Gang ' have tormented the southern Philippines in a terrorism campaign ostensibly aimed at creating a separate Islamic state. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people living in the chiefly Catholic Philippines, but they dominate the southern islands. <p> Abu Sayyaf deemed fringe <p> Unlike the 12,500-member Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, which has achieved a certain legitimacy through negotiations with the government, Abu Sayyaf is discounted by officials as a mere group of thugs without ideology. <p> ' Even most Muslims do not side with Abu Sayyaf. We are against terrorism, ' said Erlinda ' Norma ' Pangadaman, the chief of the Maharlika Village barangai, or local political district. <p> Pangadaman, who wraps herself in a pale hoodlike shawl called a neejav, traditionally worn by Muslim women in this region, said the group violates the peaceful teachings of the Koran. <p> The sect was founded in the early 1990s by Abdurajak Janjalani, a veteran of the Muslim holy war waged against the Soviets in Afghanistan, and has left a trail of blood in a series of bombings of Christian churches in the Philippines. <p> But Abu Sayyaf really rose to prominence in 1995, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torching of the town of Ipil. The group also was implicated in a plot to assassinate visiting Pope John Paul II. <p> Janjalani, who was killed in a 1998 firefight, reportedly had ties to Libya and bin Laden 's terrorist network, having trained with Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted that year in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Yousef is in the federal Supermax penitentiary in Florence, Colo. <p> Now under the leadership of Janjalani 's younger brother, Khadaffy, the fractured organization stepped up its campaign of kidnapping for ransom last spring, nabbing nearly 50 people, including Wichita missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham. <p> At one point, Abu Sayyaf claimed 4,000 members ; now, authorities say, that number has dwindled to about 80 hard-core militants. <p> Terrorists remain elusive <p> One of the main difficulties in rooting out Abu Sayyaf, however, is its constantly changing membership of mercenaries, decentralized organization and sympathetic neighbors. <p> ' One day, they 're members of MILF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayyaf, ' Col. Detaboli said. ' They could hit and run and be hidden by their relatives living in the area, ' easily crossing back and forth between legitimacy and criminal activity. <p> In a country with half of its population impoverished and in double-digit unemployment, many sympathizers are lured by the prospect of hefty ransoms claimed by the group. At one point, after a hostages-for-cash exchange negotiated with the Libyan government in 2000, the Sulu Islands were said to have been flush with crisp, new $ 100 bills. <p> ' Terrorism and poverty are interlinked, ' Arroyo told Time magazine. ' When people are poor, they are more discontented. ' <p> Particularly in the south, people live hand-to-mouth in thatch-roofed homes, many set on stilts in the salt marshes along the coasts. <p> Outside of the diverse business center of Manila, most of the rural regions depend on agriculture, fishing and tourism - none of which have been sufficient to improve the overall economy - and the latter has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common person, Abu Sayyaf is our main problem because it affects tourism, ' said Manila taxi driver Jenny Valencia. ' People do n't come here. They do n't go to Boracay, where they have nice beaches. They do n't go to Corregidor or diving at Palawan because they are scared. ' <p> In fact, the U.S. State Department advises Americans against traveling to islands in the south and has a general warning issued for the entire country. <p> Last week, an Israeli tourist was stabbed at Boracay, and a high-profile golf tournament organized by Koreans on Mindanao Island was canceled. <p> Bombings, once a monthly occurrence, have created a ghost town of the curio shops lining the narrow streets of Zamboanga, and were it not for journalists flocking to the area, hotels would be empty. <p> ' We need to eliminate the scourge of terrorism, ' said Mayor Maria Clara Lobregat. ' It has been devastating for us. ' <p> At the Zamboanga City Hall - a Spanish colonial-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1905 - staff members wear T-shirts emblazoned with American flags that read ' I love the USA. ' <p> Little contact with locals <p> Nearby, a park is dedicated to the late U.S. Gen. John ' Blackjack ' Pershing, who once served as governor of the territory. ' The majority of Zamboanganos retain their appreciation of the Americans, ' Lobregat said. <p> But many do not, Gen. Wurster pointed out, meaning the U.S. troops will have little interaction with the locals other than the Scout Rangers during the six months of military exercises. <p> From the start, however, relations have been rocky. A U.S. military C-130 transport plane was struck by two bullets on a low-level flight over the northern island of Luzon in the first days of activity. <p> Meanwhile, Shariff Julabbi, head of the MILF on Basilan Island, said his charges will shoot U.S. troops venturing into their territory. <p> ' You do not hold war games in strife-torn areas, ' he said. ' The U.S. forces are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to encroach into our territories because we will surely respond drastically. ' <p> U.S. leaders insist the rescue of the Burnhams is a Filipino matter and that the troops will not conduct any offensive strikes ; but they 'll be allowed to defend themselves. <p> Their main purpose, however, is to share information with their Filipino counterparts, who are so poor that they yell ' rat-a-tat-tat ' during war games rather than shoot blanks. <p> ' This, ' said Philippine army Capt. Harold Carbunog, ' is the Filipinos ' war against the Abu Sayyaf. ' @p#
