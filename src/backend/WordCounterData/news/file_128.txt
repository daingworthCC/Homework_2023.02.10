3026641 <p> Conventional wisdom does n't count for much in a gambling town that favors long odds. <p> Maybe that 's what makes Reno a good hometown for one of the USA 's newest airlines - a venture that expert opinion suggests is the longest of long shots. <p> With just two MD-80 jets, fewer than 100 employees and the highest of hopes, Reno Air took to the skies July 1, flying twice daily between here and Los Angeles and Seattle. It 's already expanding. By early next month, it plans to add flights to San Diego and Portland and more flights to Los Angeles and Seattle. " We 've done everything we can. Now it 's up to the marketplace to tell us whether it works, " says founder Joseph Lorenzo, a former executive with Continental and Frontier airlines who has anticipated this moment for eight years. <p> Never mind that U.S. airlines have lost more than $ 6 billion the past two years. Or that three big airlines have disappeared the past 18 months and three more are teetering on the edge. Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago is out of business. <p> Reno Air executives think they can beat the odds - and they are n't the only ones. Like seedlings that sprout after a forest fire, a new crop of airlines is springing up from the industry 's wreckage. At least nine proposals for jet airlines are pending at the Transportation Department or have been announced in the trade press. More than a dozen charter airlines - mostly using puddle-jumper planes - are trying to make the leap to scheduled service. Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Shane says his department receives applications for new airlines almost weekly, and he expects no letup. <p> The odds that any of them will become a major airline - as People Express and America West did in the 1980s - are slim. But the industry 's top CEOs say this is the wave of the future. " It is as certain as night follows day that the years ahead will see the emergence of new competitors,... " says American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall. <p> Why? Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low- fare, low-cost competition. And the demise of Eastern, Pan Am and Midway has sharply reduced the cost of starting an airline. Thousands of good planes and lots of talent are on the market at bargain prices. <p> Indeed, Midway Airlines ' failure turned out to be a lucky break for Reno Air. The board hired former Midway president Jeffrey Erickson to be chief executive, who in turn brought on other seasoned former Midway managers and pilots. <p> Much of Reno Air 's equipment - from ticket stampers to computers - was snapped up for 10 cents on the dollar at Midway 's liquidation last winter. Jets that used to be Midway 's are being leased for two-thirds of what they would have cost in 1990, Erickson says. <p> An abundance of people and planes does n't guarantee success, though. " It 's the best time in history to start an airline, but it 's a tough time to raise money, " says Bruce Nobles, a former president of the Pan Am and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group that wanted to raise $ 125 million for an Atlanta-based airline called New Eastern. Led by former Eastern employees, the group unsuccessfully tried for a year to raise money. An effort to start a low-fare business fliers ' airline in Kansas City, Mo., also came up dry. Given the poor track record of start-ups, it 's easy to see why investors are reluctant to finance them. Even America West, the biggest surviving start- up since deregulation, is in bankruptcy reorganization. <p> Some say new airlines must find a niche, a market underserved by the big carriers. But " there are n't many niches left, " says aviation consultant Morten Beyer. <p> Still, Reno Air has shown that raising money is not impossible. Two years ago, Paradise Valley Securities, a small investment-banking firm in Phoenix, raised $ 2 million that gave Lorenzo the seed money he needed to get started. Last month, again with Paradise Valley 's help, the airline raised an additional $ 6 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts would say you 've got to be crazy to put money in an airline, but we 're contrarians, " says Paradise Valley partner Hayden Fleming. " We think this project has significant upside, that it can happen quickly and our investors can do pretty well. " <p> Indeed, Reno Air expects to generate $ 47 million in revenue in its first 12 months and operate profitably. <p> One reason for Reno Air executives ' confidence is their location, which they say has plenty to offer visitors but is underserved by other airlines. The Reno/Lake Tahoe area has 32 hotel-casinos, 16 alpine-ski resorts, nine cross-country-ski areas and 20 golf courses. <p> No airline operates a hub in Reno, and there are only five non-stop round- trip flights daily to Los Angeles and six daily to Seattle. <p> " It 's a well-rounded destination. What it lacks is decent air service at reasonable prices because it is a spoke from everyone else 's hub, " says Erickson. " Therein lies the niche. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering lower fares than do competitors - which they hope will spur a 70% increase in air travel to and from Reno within 12 months. <p> Reno Air 's full-coach fares, $ 160 to $ 240 round trip depending on the day, are $ 75 to $ 100 lower than competitors ' fares. Its low fares do n't require Saturday-night stays. <p> Reno Air also hopes to skim some business fliers from competitors traveling non-stop between Los Angeles and Seattle. Its strategy : Sell cheaper first-class fares to fliers who fly through Reno. <p> But Reno Air is no carbon copy of discounter Southwest Airlines, famous for serving only peanuts and soda. " We wo n't do the peanut shuffle, " says Erickson. Reno Air has slightly classier aspirations : Muffins will be served on breakfast flights. <p> Much planning has gone into Reno Air, too. " I ca n't tell you the number of hours I 've tossed and turned at night. We have total confidence because we tossed and turned, " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One big decision was on the type of jet to fly. To hold down costs for spare parts and training, executives decided to stick with one aircraft type. But they wanted one capable of flying non-stop to the East Coast, which Reno Air hopes to serve. In the end, the airline chose the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 over the Boeing 737 because fewer coach seats had to be removed to make room for a 21-seat first-class section. <p> The key to Reno Air 's success may be the amount of support it gets from the Reno community - particularly the casinos. Lorenzo hopes to structure tour packages offering discounted air and hotel rates to attract fliers to Reno. That business eventually could account for one quarter of Reno Air 's traffic. The question : Will the casinos support a small, hometown airline over established, major airlines? <p> Another challenge for Reno Air will be to grow without expanding too fast - a fatal mistake for more than one start-up airline. Aviation lawyer and Reno Chairman Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ego cancer does n't strike Reno Air. CUTLINE : WAITING FOR TAKEOFF : CEO Jeff Erickson calls Reno a well-rounded destination that lacks decent air service and prices - gaps Reno Air expects its hub there to fill.
