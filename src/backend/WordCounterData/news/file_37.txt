3005441 <p> As you have undoubtedly heard, " Cavalleria Rustica na " and " I Pagliacci " are moving. By Saturday eve ning, assuming all goes well, the New York City Opera will have completed the relocation of Mascagni 's and Leoncavallo 's perennial verismo twins -- cartons unpacked, curtains hung, dishes put away, breakage and loss tallied -- from their ancestral homes in, respectively, Sicily and Calabria to New York 's Little Italy. <p> Actually, City Opera is becoming a practiced hand at these long-distance hauls. Only last night, Verdi 's " Traviata, " formerly resident in stodgy old Paris, was safely ensconced in present-day New York and Paris. <p> And perhaps it will all work out. There 's nothing inherently impossible in this business of transposing an opera setting. Still, the business shows signs of getting out of hand, and in the specific case of the verismo twins, the theory -- that transposition can make the subject matter more available to an audience -- seems especially dubious. <p> These are operas that openly aspire to reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Prologue to " Pagliacci. " To cite just the famous climax( better still would be to listen to it from the throat of a good baritone) : " And you, rather than our poor actors ' cloaks, consider our souls, since we are men of flesh and bone, and like you we breathe the air of this orphan world. " A worthy goal, one would think, for any kind of opera. <p> Nevertheless, the popular understanding of " verismo " seems to inspire attention mostly to those actors ' cloaks. For example, in a recent published interview, City Opera 's general director, Christopher Keene, ventured that verismo opera " should really shove your face in the grit and grime, " as if " truth " were equivalent to " grit and grime. " " No more happy peasants in pretty costumes, " Mr. Keene promised. " These will likely be the most violent productions of the two operas that New York has seen. " <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both operas if not " happy peasants " -- and at least in " Cavalleria, " on Easter Sunday morning, in their prettiest costumes. For that matter, the merchants and homemakers of " Cavalleria, " which takes place in the village square, would probably have something to say about this " grit and grime " stuff -- do n't you get the feeling from the score and the setting that this village glistens under the Sicilian sun? <p> Nor is it apparent what " violent productions " have to contribute to these operas. The world of " Cavalleria " is in fact one of extreme order. It certainly contains violence, but you would hardly know it from most of what happens in the opera, and even the act of violence in which it culminates is specific and contained -- Turiddu knows the inevitable outcome of his involvement with Alfio 's wife. The world of " Pagliacci, " apart from the demons lurking in Canio 's mind, is n't noticeably violent at all. <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any great work of art, you would surely want to start by discovering their worlds. Their concerns are closely linked to time and place : the orthodox social-religious values that permeate the Sicilian village depicted on this hot Easter Sunday in " Cavalleria " ; the entertainment-starved Calabrian village that provides a backdrop for the rootlessness of the traveling players depicted in " Pagliacci. " <p> The values represented in these operas, and the conflicts that grow out of them, surely have universal relevance. Is n't that why we have great composers? Transpose the setting, and what are the chances of finding sufficiently close and consistent equivalents? Is n't it likely to be harder rather than easier to to make an audience recognize and identify with those values and conflicts? <p> " Cav " and " Pag " were meant to be revolutionary operas, and they are. It should n't be held against them that the hoped-for revolution never really happened, that it was co-opted by cartoon images of " verismo. " It should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching this relatively youthful achievement.( Mascagni was 26 when " Cavalleria " had its premiere, in 1890 ; he died in 1945. Leoncavallo was 35 when " Pagliacci " had its premiere, in 1892 ; he died in 1919.) <p> So where might one look for the revolutionary truth of the verismo twins? An example from each opera may serve to show how a performer has found real life in the score, guided by the " Pagliacci " Prologue 's admonition that its author " was inspired by what is true. " Conducting ' Cavalleria ' <p> In 1940, the 76-year-old Mascagni accepted an invitation to conduct a recording of " Cavalleria, " complete with a wonderfully stagy spoken introduction. The recording is n't generally much admired. The performance is slow. There 's not much aural evidence of passionate involvement on the part of the orchestra and chorus of La Scala. The general explanation is that the composer was old and tired, not to mention 50 years removed from the act of composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> And yet, whether or not Mascagni would have conducted the opera the same way 50 years earlier, he seems to me in close touch with the compositional impulse. He produces a dramatic coherence and power unapproached by anyone else I 've heard -- the only conductors who even pursued this direction being Herbert von Karajan in his recording and Leonard Bernstein at the Met. <p> From the opening theme of the Prelude, sweet and sultry, Mascagni 's performance seems generated by the physical life of the village : the heat through which the inhabitants move with stength of purpose but economy of energy, the communal investment in the morning preparations for the Easter service and then the service itself. <p> The " Regina Coeli " can have such a monumental impact that one almost sympathizes with Francis Ford Coppola 's impulse to cheat in " Godfather III, " pretending that this great chorus is the climax of the opera rather than a relatively early event. <p> For the villagers, it may in fact be the climax of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic reality that provides context for subsequent events : the ringing affirmation that " the Lord is not dead " answers all the Big Questions for the villagers and binds them in answer, even as it excludes poor excommunicated Santuzza, for all the fervor of her prayer. <p> Excommunication in fact seems to have given Santuzza a shred of identity, however heartbreaking : " Sono scomunicata! " -- the central fact of her existence, which nobody in the village appears even to remember.( She has to remind both Mamma Lucia and Turiddu.) <p> Make Santuzza 's place in the community real, and she can be among the most heart-rending protagonists in opera. To hear how the opera 's gruesome climax emerges from the texture of daily life in the village, listen to the composer shape his own score. Singing Silvio <p> " Pagliacci " is a more straightforward piece, and comes with a built-in road map to reality in the form of the Prologue. So a different form of example may be helpful. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glut of wonderful baritones made his services unneeded at the Met, the Canadian baritone Allan Monk lent considerable distinction to the second-line principal roles in which he was cast. These came to include Silvio, the second baritone in " Pagliacci, " who has the great scene in which he persuades Nedda to " fly with me, " and then returns at the end to become Canio 's second victim. <p> Essentially no information is provided about Silvio. There 's just what can be gleaned in the passionate utterances of the duet. Since lovers in the throes of infatuation tend to sound similar, it 's easy to think of Silvio as a more dashing and gallant alternative to the outwardly charming and inwardly raging Canio. <p> And then there was Allan Monk : a somewhat dumpy looking fellow with a lovely, cultivated voice and a highly developed sense of truth in his singing -- the instinct and ability to sing as a human being. And for once the scene made real sense. Silvio is offering Nedda peace, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with Canio, of which the audience has just seen a fairly brutal sampling. <p> " The author has sought to paint for you a slice of life, " the " Pagliacci " Prologue sings. " His only maxim is that the artist is a person, and that he must write for people. " The authors of both these operas have done their job too well, in that both operas have a built-in emotional power that 's hard to spoil. But if their inspiration were to be found in " what is true, " they might then rise to a whole other kind of power. ' CAV/PAGS ' ON CD, AND OTHERS MISSED <p> As a group, the " Pagliacci " recordings are stronger than those of the trickier " Cavalleria Rusticana. "( All available recordings cited are on CD only.) <p> First, some overall choices. For " Pagliacci, " a pair : the low-key but well-sung 1954 New York recording with Jussi Bjoerling, Victoria de los Angeles, Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), and the vibrant 1961 Scala recording with Franco Corelli, conducted by Lovro von Matacic( Angel ; currently unavailable). <p> For " Cavalleria " : Bjoerling 's 1958 Florence stereo remake, with Renata Tebaldi and Ettore Bastianini( RCA, then London ; currently unavailable). <p> Among the available stereo versions, tread carefully. Herbert von Karajan 's 1965 Scala coupling( Deutsche Grammophon 419 257-2), while somewhat overrefined, is beautifully played and well enough sung. London 's 1960 recordings( 421 870-2) offer slightly stodgy but idiomatic performances with forceful singing by Mario del Monaco and Cornell MacNeil, plus capable colleagues. London 's presentable 1967 " Pagliacci "( uncut) with James McCracken, Pilar Lorengar, Robert Merrill( now Tonio) and Tom Krause has been reissued by Innovative Music Productions( IMPX 9017). <p> Finally, some interesting supplements, beginning with the Canio and Turiddu of Beniamino Gigli -- still in ringing form in the 1934 " Pagliacci "( Angel CDH 63309 ; mono) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavalleria, " with Gino Bechi( Angel CDHB 69987 ; mono) ; Bongiovanni has issued a listenable 1938 composer-conducted " Cavalleria " from The Hague( GB 1050-2) -- also slow but more urgent. There are points of interest in the work of Callas and company in their 1953-54 recordings( Angel CDCC 47981 ; mono).
