3058641 <p> My two closest encounters with death have come as a traveler - once in London, another time in Nairobi. The incidents were separated by 3,000 miles and five years, but they had a common genesis. <p> In London, I turned a corner in my compact rental car and found myself within inches of the grill of a huge lorry, whose driver had braked sharply and was shouting at me in bulged-vein anger. Fear lay in my stomach like a load of wet clothes in a dryer. <p> In Nairobi, I stepped off the curb directly into the path of an onrushing bus, whose driver swerved to avoid me. The bus was as unexpected as a snowflake, and I stood terror-frozen into an exclamation point, my heart rattling in my rib cage. <p> Whoever said there 's no adventure left in traveling has n't been a driver or a pedestrian in Great Britain or Kenya. Or Japan, Ireland, Cyprus, Australia - or any other of the 51 nations where driving is done on the left side of the road - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and most of the world. In these other places, which we shall call left-drive, getting there is half the effort. <p> I do n't consider myself a slouch behind the wheel. My driving skills were developed largely on the sink-or-swim streets in and around New York City and honed over 35 accident-free years. But they did me little good in the left-drive world. <p> In London, my jet-lagged brain simply got jammed with confusing images( perceived from the right side of the front seat) and I reacted instinctively ; I turned right into the right lane - right into the path of the lorry. <p> In Nairobi, I was in a hurry. As I began crossing the street, I unthinkingly did what I always do back home in Philadelphia - looked to my left. The bus was coming from the right. <p> Many people are hopeful that two pending developments - the emergence of a united Europe and the opening of a tunnel across the English Channel - will set Britain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Not bloody likely. <p> Driving on the left is right up there with Parliament, the Magna Carta, the English language, the proper British passport, dogs, gardens, clotted cream and the pint in terms of British reverence. I ca n't help wondering, however, if it 's mere coincidence that the dissolution of the British empire began just one generation after automobiles became widespread. <p> Several years ago, European police chiefs pressured the British to change their ways, but they were told by a senior traffic official that the idea was " absurd. " Last February, a European Community committee recommended a " uniform " highway code for Europe ; but it allows the British to continue driving on the left. European freedom of movement <p> Now European unity is supposedly not far around corner as the 1990s unfold, despite the potential roadblocks that loom. No more trade barriers, national borders, customs officers, or any hindrance to unity. We will have the free movement of goods and people within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost. <p> The 31-mile Eurotunnel, from Dover to Calais, is expected to open in December, 1993. It will have two rail tunnels, and that will be the easy part for motorists. They will drive aboard special freight cars at terminals in Folkstone, England, or Sangatte, France, and remain in their vehicles while the train makes the 20-minute crossing. <p> But once they get through the tunnel, what will they do? The planners are working on how to prepare drivers, both mentally and physically, for driving on the opposite side of the road. <p> To prevent the terminals from becoming huge junkyards, tunnel officials plan to issue " Drive Right " and " Drive Left " windshield stickers, which they hope will remind foreign motorists to keep to the appropriate side of the road. They also hope the drivers will remove the stickers for the return trip. <p> While in London recently, I posed some questions to the Royal Automobile Club and its rival, the British Automobile Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving continental drivers occur within the first few miles of channel ports. In England, pedestrians are more likely to be killed by a car than in most any other part of the world. This largely has to do with tourists looking the wrong way( left) instead of the right way( right) before stepping off the curb. Studies show that the highest concentration of road accidents involving Britons in Europe occurs during the first 60 miles after they drive off the ferry boats in right-hand France. <p> Back home, I called the British Tourist Authority in New York, and a representative gave me the old " Problem? What-problem? " response, professing to have absolutely no information or insights on the problem. <p> But tourism is a huge business in Britain, and Americans are the biggest customers. A poll by the tourist industry found that Americans ' biggest gripes about the place were expensive food, the weather - and driving on the left. <p> Most American tourists touch down around London, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets. Not only do London 's streets not run parallel and perpendicular, they often change names without warning. And the names of the streets are often on the sides of buildings, sometimes on the sixth floor. All over Britain there are " roundabouts "( traffic circles). Under British law, or so it would seem, all car-rental locations are within one mile of a busy roundabout, where at least three hired assassins are circling waiting for an unwary American to enter. <p> The rule for ships at sea is uniform worldwide - vessels pass on the right - and it seems curious that mankind would not have settled on one side of the road for land vehicles. How we reached our present state of confusion on this matter is in itself rather confusing. <p> Way back in early Roman times, an edict went out that in order to stop congestion on the Tiber Bridge, all traffic should go on the left. Why left instead of right has been lost to history ; but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as it was, moved on the left side of the roads, such as they were. <p> The rule of left was reinforced by knighthood. Fights on horseback were practical only when the knights traveled to the left because the reins and shield were held in the left hand, the weapon with the right. This, of course, applied only to right-handed knights. The mortality rate was probably higher for southpaw knights in merry Olde England, just as it is today for American motorists of either manual persuasion. <p> Left-hand travel was extended to wagon drivers and coachmen, who sat on the right side of their vehicles. If they rode on the right side of the road, their use of the whip was impeded by narrow city streets. This does not explain why these drivers did n't shift over to the left side of their vehicles - thereby making it imperative that they drive on the right side of the road as civilized people do today. The role of Robespierre <p> Which naturally brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robespierre, an atheist who was determined to break the power of the church and Rome. He set out to display freedom wherever possible. One way was to abolish the papal traffic law and make the French people switch over to the right. <p> When Napoleon started conquering Europe, he attacked from the right flank in violation of principles of combat that had been in place since Richard the Lionhearted. By the time Napoleon was idling on St. Helena, only Britain and Sweden - the two countries he did n't reach in western Europe - were still driving on the left. In most of the nations of eastern Europe, the rule of the left prevailed until the Nazis imposed their will during World War II. <p> Thus ask a Briton on the street why he drives on the left, and he may tell you it 's because Mother England was never conquered by Napoleon or Hitler. And that goes for former colonies, he 'll likely add. <p> But wait a minute. The United States is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left? There 's one convoluted theory about the teamsters on the Conestoga wagons, but a more likely reason is the smoldering opposition among the colonists to any custom of the Old World. Laws requiring that drivers of vehicles keep to the right side of the road were among the earliest traffic rules in America, and the first state law requiring right-side travel was passed by Pennsylvania in 1792. <p> On Sept. 3, 1967, at 4:50 a.m., all traffic came to a halt in Sweden. Drivers paused for a minute, then changed over to the right side of the road. Then they paused again and waited until 5 a.m. It was probably the most complex single highway operation ever undertaken. <p> It took four years of intensive planning, $ 120 million in public funds, and an ingrained desire to conform with the rest of Scandinavia, but the Great Swedish Switch was achieved safely. Indeed, there were fewer than normal accidents on Hoger Dag( Right Day). <p> The decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They said it was like turning on the cat and putting out the radio. The joke was that buses and trams would make the change first, cars and trucks a few months later. <p> When the Canadian province of British Columbia changed over to the right side in 1920, there were only a few accidents, but horses had a lot of trouble. Nobody told them about the new law, and since they were used to moving on the left side of the road, they kept doing it for several months. <p> The Italians drove on the left in the countryside, on the right in the cities until Mussolini standardized rightside travel. You know what happened to him. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek ordered in 1946 that all of China be required to drive on the right. Where else? <p> Other nations that have changed from left to right include Austria( 1937), Czechoslovakia( 1939), Hungary( 1939), Panama( 1943), Argentina( 1946), the Philippines( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946), Gambia( 1965), Bahrain( 1967), Iceland( 1968), and Burma( 1970). <p> The British Automobile Association concedes there is no record of any nation changing from the right to the left. <p> Among the 51 nations where traffic keeps to the left are Ireland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, U.S. Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Bali, Malaysia, Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua, Saint Lucia, and Hong Kong. Call for World Uniformity <p> The only call for world uniformity came in 1913 when an international committee reported that the dual system was " an outstanding source of danger and difficulty " and recommended one rule for all nations. <p> In 1985, Horst Seefeld, a German member of the European Parliament, suggested that the multi-national assembly commission a study of what advantages there would be to having Britain change over to the right. <p> " Most of the British members attacked me, " he remembers. " They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like it, they could also switch to the left. " <p> Feasibility studies in the 1970s, when Britain joined the Common Market, concluded the switch would be prohibitively expensive : $ 20 billion for such things as new road signs, bus doors and auto steering wheels. <p> Perhaps drive-left Bermuda has the best solution to this global problem : It does n't allow foreigners to drive at all. <p> Writer William Ecenbarger lives in Lebanan, Pa.
