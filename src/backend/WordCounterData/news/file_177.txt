3034241 <p> It has gotten to the point where some opponents do n't even hope to beat the No. 1-ranked University of Tennessee 's women 's basketball team. They only hope to survive. <p> " I thought before the game, ' Oh Lord, please do n't let us get beat by 59 points, ' " Alabama point guard Brittany Ezell said after the Crimson Tide played here on Sunday. " I was shocked by that Georgia game. I never thought I 'd see an SEC team beat another SEC team by 59 points. " <p> That Georgia game occurred four days earlier, and the Lady Bulldogs -- ranked 17th at the time -- absorbed a 102-43 hammering, the worst loss in the program 's history. By halftime, all-American forward Chamique Holdsclaw had outscored the Georgia team, 22-21. <p> But the Crimson Tide gave Tennessee its sternest test of the season in a 73-66 defeat. It was the first time this season that the Lady Vols, who lost starting guard Kyra Elzy to a season-ending knee injury in the first half, did n't win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best loss we 've ever had, " Ezell said with a mixture of glee and relief. <p> Such is life these days against Tennessee( 24-0), which has won 30 consecutive games and is seeking its third consecutive national championship -- an achievement that would be unprecedented in women 's college basketball. <p> With a team that has no seniors and is starting three freshmen, the Lady Vols are averaging 90.1 points per game and winning by an average of nearly 33. <p> And they are not doing it by running up scores against small-time opponents. Their conference, the Southeastern, remains the nation 's toughest, with six teams other than Tennessee among the top 35 in this week 's Associated Press poll. <p> In addition, the Lady Vols are n't compensating with a weak nonconference schedule. Saturday 's game against No. 3 Old Dominion -- a rematch of last season 's NCAA final -- will be their 11th of the season against a ranked team, their sixth against a team in the top 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top 10. <p> About the only dent that can be made in their schedule is that they 've played only one ranked team as a visitor -- then-No. 19 Georgia, which they beat, 96-71, in Athens on Jan. 14. Two of those games were on neutral courts, the rest -- like Saturday 's -- at home. <p> Still, dominance is dominance. <p> Things got so out of hand when Tennessee was in the midst of a 45-6 run over No. 12 Florida on Jan. 10 that Gators Coach Carol Ross said, " I closed my eyes. " It was 57-18 at the half and Ross said after a 99-60 loss, " That 's the first time I 've told a team at halftime we were not going to win the ballgame. " <p> The big reason Tennessee has become so dominant this season is that Pat Summitt, in her 24th season as Tennessee 's coach, has not stood in the way of her talent. Her Tennessee teams in the 1980s and early ' 90s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, rebounding and fierce half-court defense. <p> This Tennessee team feeds on speed. It plays an end-to-end game fueled by a press that does n't leave a safe spot on the floor. Opponents are averaging 27.3 turnovers per game. <p> The 45-year-old Summitt said of the transition : " It 's like me going from a meat-eater to a vegetarian. It 's been a big change in style. " <p> The resulting fast-paced games, and big victories, have electrified the town and set off a frenzy of ticket buying. Saturday 's game has been declared a sellout at 24,535-seat Thompson-Boling Arena -- the first time in Lady Vols history that a game there has been sold out in advance. The crowd may become the largest to see a women 's college basketball game. The mark was set here Jan. 3, when Tennessee met Connecticut and drew 24,597, with standing-room tickets sold. <p> For the season, the Lady Vols are averaging 13,758 per game. The arena -- where Tennessee has won 103 of its past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open an hour before tip-off. Now it opens 1 1/2 hours early to accommodate the crowds, particularly the young fans who flock to the bottom row to watch warmups. Many cars lined up along Neyland Drive waiting to get into parking lots carry the bumper sticker : " In Tennessee, men are just men. Women are champions. " <p> Even Michael Jordan has taken notice. When the Lady Vols were in Chicago in January to play DePaul, a 79-point victory for Tennessee, Jordan invited them to his downtown Chicago office for an afternoon visit. He asked Holdsclaw, who also wears a No. 23 jersey, when they were going to play one-on-one. <p> Five-on-five with the Bulls may be the only way the Lady Vols lose a game this season, said Alabama Coach Rick Moody. <p> " They have the most talent of any women 's team I 've ever seen, " he said. <p> Holdsclaw, the national player of the year as a sophomore last season, is the most talented of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points per game and is already second in all-time scoring at Tennessee. <p> She can play inside and outside and has become the best one-on-one defender on the team. Holdsclaw, who carried Tennessee to the national title in 1997 almost single-handedly, has plenty of help this season thanks to a four-player freshman class that is being called by some observers the best ever in women 's college basketball. <p> Tamika Catchings, the daughter of former NBA center Harvey Catchings, is averaging 18 points per game. The 6-1 forward has been unstoppable with short jumpers around the lane. Semeka Randall, a 5-10 guard from Cleveland who was rated the best high school player in the country last season, comes off the bench and averages 16 points per game. She also sparks the suffocating full-court press. <p> Teresa Geter, a 6-3 center, also starts and averages seven points and five rebounds a game. Kristen Clement, a 5-11 guard and sometime model, averages 20 minutes and six points per game. <p> " When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we had to play like veterans right away and play like we 've been here two or three years, " said Randall, who turns 19 Saturday. " I 'm glad we got a chance. We 've been able to step up and show what we 're capable of doing. " <p> Even Summitt has been in awe of the way the team has come together without a senior starter. <p> " I do n't think I expected us to be this good to this extent, " Summitt said. " I thought we had a chance to be a good basketball team. I knew we were not that strong on the inside, but we had some excellent team speed and quickness. You never can tell when you 're playing freshmen. " <p> There have been only two blemishes on this otherwise spectacular season. The first was a spat with Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma, whose second-ranked Huskies were overwhelmed in the second half here Jan. 3 and lost, 84-69. After the game, Randall blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " scared " when the Lady Vols took control of the game with their full-court press. <p> Auriemma angrily called Tennessee " trash talkers " and said the Lady Vols " choked " in 1995, when the Huskies beat Tennessee in a national semifinal. Summitt said Auriemma " overreacted. " <p> More serious is the injury to Elzy, who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee. The 6-1 sophomore was one of the main cogs in the full-court press because of her long arms and quickness. Without Elzy, the Lady Vols forced just three turnovers in the second half against Alabama, and a close-knit team clearly was shaken by the injury. <p> " It gets you back down to reality, " Holdsclaw said after the seven-point victory over the Crimson Tide. " It hits your team pretty hard. " <p> Not as hard as Tennessee has hit opponents this season. On Wednesday night, the Lady Vols had to pull themselves together and play at Mississippi. The halftime score was 54-17, @ @ @
