4085841 " Cats &amp; Dogs : The Revenge of Kitty Galore " # B This is a spy send-up, specifically of James Bond movies. The opening titles alone are super clever, an indication of the kind of eye for detail that 's in store throughout -- - and from there, the jokes fly fast and furious along with the fur. Surprisingly, most of them work. But the mix of live action, puppetry and computer animation makes a jumbled look that is the movie 's chief weakness.( Christy Lemire, Associated Press) Rated PG for animal action and humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 27 minutes. # PARENTS GUIDE There are chase scenes with cats and dogs flying through the air and falling and seeming to be in jeopardy. # " Charlie St. Cloud " # C " Charlie St. Cloud " ably packages Zac Efron in a teen weeper, a transitional romance that takes the " High School Musical " star into his 20s, with adult concerns and emotional issues and a romance that accepts adult consequences.

Anna Mouglalis and Mads Mikkelsen play the title roles with elegance, and between them stands Stravinsky 's wife, Katarina( Elena Morozova), who sees everything and perhaps understands better than they do. Fascinating, gorgeous, but of course not heartwarming.( Roger Ebert, Universal Press Syndicate) Rated R for some strong sexuality and nudity.

At Landmark Midtown. 1 hour, 31 minutes. # " Dinner for Schmucks " # B Like the French film( " The Dinner Game ") it is based on, " Dinner for Schmucks " takes a leisurely gambol up to the party in which a bunch of arrogant rich twits each bring a dolt to dinner so that they can mock them. But like a four-star dessert at the end of a hit-or-miss four-course meal, the finale is worth the wait.( Roger Moore, McClatchy / Tribune) Rated PG-13 for sequences of crude and sexual content, some partial nudity and language.

But as nice as the images are, there 's not much in this film that screams out " large format "( IMAX, Omnimax, etc.). Still, there 's elegance in the film 's unsentimental treatment of these animals and this world, making this a useful bit of film education for children who are just now outgrowing their DVD of The Lion King.( Roger Moore, McClatchy / Tribune) Unrated. At Fernbank. 40 minutes. # " The A Team " # D- An incomprehensible mess with the 1980s TV show embedded. At more than two hours of queasy-cam anarchy, it 's punishment.

At first glance " Agora, " a rousing, finger-pointing drama from the Chilean-born director Alejandro Amenabar is a bit of a puzzle. This is a good thing, because most movies plop down in easily recognizable categories and stay there.( A. O. Scott, New York Times) Unrated. At Landmark Midtown. 2 hours, 6 minutes. # " Best Worst Movie " # B Anyone can make a bad movie. It takes a unique set of circumstances to make a movie so horrible that people celebrate its badness two decades later.

At metro theaters. 1 hour, 31 minutes. # " Despicable Me " # B A villain instead of a hero is rare in an animated comedy, but the villain is worth his starring role. He 's Gru( voice by Steve Carell), who hatches a dastardly scheme to steal the moon. Supported by countless little yellow Minions and challenged by three plucky orphan girls, he does battle with his arch-nemesis, Vector( Jason Segel).

Contains obscenity, violence, nudity, sex, rape and smoking. At Landmark Midtown. 2 hours, 32 minutes. # " Grown Ups " # C A pleasant, genial, good-hearted, sometimes icky comedy, not very funny, that 's like spending a weekend with well-meaning people you do n't want to see again anytime real soon.( Roger Ebert, Universal Press Syndicate) Rated PG-13 for crude material including suggestive references, language and some male rear nudity.

At metro theaters. 2 hours, 5 minutes. # " The Karate Kid " # C Director Harald Zwart( " Agent Cody Banks ") hits all the same notes and adheres closely to Robert Mark Kamen 's original script.

At metro theaters. 1 hour, 44 minutes. # " Knight and Day " # B Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in a goofy action-comedy-romance. The goofiness and the charm they bring to it works, but the film miscalculates on the proportion of rom-com to action, and has so much special-effects violence it throws the balance off.( Roger Ebert, Universal Press Syndicate) Rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence throughout, and brief strong language.
