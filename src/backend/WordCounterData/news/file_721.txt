4194141 <p> Tigers manager Brad Ausmus parked in the Tigers dugout Monday afternoon talking about various team matters as his team got ready for a six-game homestand. <p> It was mentioned to Ausmus that a dramatic falloff, in a megastar 's hitting timeline, was so rare as to seem inexplicable. <p> " I think there 's unquestionably superstars that have had down years, I really do, " he said, recalling that Jeff Bagwell, a Hall of Fame slugger for the Astros when Ausmus played there, had a " down year in the mid- to late ' 90s when he was awful. " <p> In fact, Bagwell dropped from.368 in 1994, when he was the National League 's Most Valuable Player, to.290 in 1995, although his 1995 OPS was still a robust.891. <p> Bagwell had other, subsequent years hitting beneath.300. But his OPS remained.900-plus. <p> Cabrera 's 2017 season is not remotely close to those Bagwell off-seasons. <p> Ausmus agreed this summer is not to be confused with Cabrera 's past. <p> " It 's definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's chasing pitches out of the zone. Sometimes he 's fighting himself. And like any hitter who 's not performing the way they 'd like to, he gets frustrated at times. " <p> Miguel Cabrera( Photo : Robin Buckson, Detroit News) <p> One theory about Cabrera : his health. It is suspected something must be crimping his swing, perhaps related to a back strain he acknowledges happened in March during the World Baseball Classic. <p> If he has a back issue, that could easily explain why Cabrera 's power has slipped noticeably, particularly to left and to center field, where he once regularly bombed sky-scraping homers. <p> Ausmus says medical reports are consistent. Cabrera is not visiting the trainers. There are no reported issues. <p> His words were meant not as doubt but as accepting possibilities Cabrera, who during past seasons has played with groin and ankle issues he often minimized, could, conceivably, be toughing out another season. <p> But there simply is no evidence of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for so long been so extraordinary. <p> Cabrera 's pure and obvious love for playing baseball can be seen in the way he kibitzes and kids with baserunners, fans, with anyone he encounters, spontaneously, during a game. <p> But his at-bats have not been pleasant. For him, or for those accustomed to a certain Hall of Fame hitter 's particular brand of annual batting prowess. <p> Cabrera, though, is not talking. The Tigers are not questioning. And so a season out of kilter and difficult to comprehend continues, with answers as elusive as those crushed home runs and doubles in which a superstar once specialized.
