3040441 <p> Atlanta Journal editorial columnist Dick Williams spoke with President Bush by telephone Monday afternoon. The president admitted that his 1990 agreement to raise taxes was a mistake and commented on his political strength in the South, defense cuts, family issues and the 1988 Willie Horton television commercials. An edited transcript of that conversation follows. <p> Williams : Let me ask you about your message in Savannah. Did I detect a switch to a more traditional form of cultural conservatism? <p> Bush : No, it is not a switch but a reaffirmation. In other words, the values I talk about there are some of the same things that I pointed out in New Hampshire - family and faith, American 's predominance in the world. These themes I feel very, very comfortable about and I hope I 've tried to stand for them as president of the United States. It was a little more emphasis, although I do n't know that it varied very much from what I said to the party people in Atlanta. <p> Williams : I think I was struck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on family. <p> Bush : Well, it could have been there, because the speech was a little shorter and we left out the defense segment and all of that but it is not a new theme with me. It is something I feel very strongly about and that we have tried to emulate in various ways. For example, I strongly believe in school choice. That, I think, is a family strengthening principle. Our whole child-care approach... was based on choice strengthening the family, letting grandmothers who stay home do some of the child-care work. So it 's a theme I have campaigned on and feel strongly about and still do. But I noticed the coverage on it and perhaps I do n't have any problem with it because I liked what I saw in terms of the points they emphasize. <p> Williams : Do you regret not putting the tax credit for children into the March 20 package that you gave Congress for immediate action? <p> Bush : Well, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill on the same day the seven-point plan went up. But what I tried to do is set aside the politics. I recognized it would be up competing with the middle-income tax cut, for example.... And my view is the first thing we have to do is to stimulate the economy through investment measures. That 's why it was not there. But for some to say that I moved away from it is just not the case. I wanted it in there, it was in there, it is just not a laser-like point of stimulation. <p> Williams : I was at the Republican affair in Atlanta Saturday and I was struck afterward talking with a lot of Georgia Republicans, who are all by nature conservative, suggesting that their biggest beef with you is that no-tax pledge thing in the 1990 budget. Ronald Reagan, for example, after his agreement to a tax increase in 1982, later called that the greatest mistake of his presidency. <p> Bush : Exactly. I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Look at all the flak it 's taken. That agreement was the only constraint on domestic spending we have ever had and it 's there and it 's working. But it is just overwhelmed by the fact that I went for a tax increase. It 's political grief.... Most of it was in the gas tax. It 's not a drag on the economy as such, but listen, if I had it to do over, I would n't do what I did then for a lot of reasons, including political reasons. However, I would love to have that in place - without the tax part - what they call the spending caps. <p> Williams : Pat Buchanan said he had an office down the hall from you and in interviews with me he spoke of his respect for you. After you win, and you soon will have enough delegates to win the nomination, how do you intend on healing any rift that exists because of the Pat Buchanan campaign. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against me is " send Bush a message. " Voters are n't sure the president understands the people are hurting. They 're not sure the president understands what to do about the economy. I will redouble my efforts to make clear that people do understand that I know what 's best for the economy.... I would just reach out my hand and say, " Come on, look what we 're up against in the fall. " <p> Even those who might be bitter about it know very well that I 'm better than what we have to contend with. I do n't think there 's a broad defection in the sense of my major policies like on education, crime, world peace or on Desert Storm or any of these individual issues. And I also think a little bit of improvement in this economy certainly would help enormously. But I would reach out my hand right away. I 've always tried to do that. I 've tried to conduct myself in this campaign so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be. <p> Williams : And do you think that Buchanan will do the same thing? He told me he will. <p> Bush : Well, I will accept his word for that. He has been pretty ugly, though. <p> Williams : I know that NEA ad is pretty rough. <p> Bush : Some of the things they do, they teach young kids to play the flutes and violins... but some of this stuff, I 've spoken out strongly against it. <p> Williams : Senator Wyche Fowler said this morning in the Georgia General Assembly that he believes we 're going to have to cut more than $ 100 billion out of our defense budget. Does that give you a good gut reaction, Mr. President? <p> Bush : That gives me a violent gut, even regurgitory reaction. I think that will be a disaster. I think that if Mr. Fowler, if he really believes that, ought to explain two things. One : How does he think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Go back a year ago to Desert Storm. And how he would explain this purely on the job front. <p> My responsibility as president is to the national security of this country. This is one of my most fundamental responsibilities. I went to the Joint Chiefs, and the chairman, Colin Powell, and the secretary, and said " We 've got to cut defense. Now let 's do it in a prudent way. " And we 've come up with $ 50 billion. And if we had to go to $ 100 billion or $ 150 billion I think we would have knocked the muscle out of our defense and I as president would not be able to certify to the American people that their national security was guaranteed. <p> So to me there are many irresponsible proposals floating around that would double or triple our defense cut and I do not think they are based on solid ground. I, as president, can not enjoy the politics that comes with paying for every social program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " And while Fowler is at it he should go to Fort Stewart or wherever else or Valdosta or a lot of other places and say, " And by the way, you 're all going to be out of work here. " And say to this heroic and wonderfully efficient volunteer Army exactly who he would cut and how. I think it is easy politics, but I think it is bad national security to make some of the ridiculous and overstated claims on defense that I 've seen. Now I have not seen what Senator Fowler said so I 'm speaking in the generic sense here.... <p> I challenged the governor of Colorado the other day when he said, " Well, we ought to take it out of defense. " I said, " You tell me where, what basis, how, and how can you certify that our security is intact? I really feel strongly on this point. I think we saw in Desert Storm an unforeseen challenge and we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do n't know where the next crisis will come, but inevitably there will be one. <p> Williams : I want to ask you the last question, sort of a political question. Lee Atwater said the South was your fire wall. Is it still your fire wall? <p> Bush : Well, I ought to be humble enough to wait and see what the vote is, but I think I 'll win all of the Southern states and I think that 's good. I think my policies are understood and I think... this " Send Bush a message " is because of the economy in this country. I think that Barbara and I still retain a certain degree of affection from the people there. I hope so. I hope I 've earned it, but I know I 've got a lot of work to do on the economy but I 'm going to keep plugging out sensible ideas and thus before the Super Tuesday part of the fire wall comes into effect, make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel good about the South. I feel comfortable there. The Southern Republican Party is not built on some basis of discrimination or making one feel inferior to another. It was never built on that. I was a pioneer of the Texas Republican Party and we never built the party on ugly racial appeals. We built it on trying to keep the federal government under control. We built it on the family, built it on these values that I tried to talk about yesterday. So I do view it as familiar ground to me and I view it as friendly ground and I hope I 've earned their merit. I hope I 've earned the confidence of the voters to win their Super Tuesday and to win there this coming Tuesday and to win there in the fall. <p> Williams : It is a long campaign( and there is time to confront the Democrats). <p> Bush : And in term of values, people do n't like it when I raise the question of values as we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race. Willie Horton was about a failed furlough policy where a guy grabbed a 17-year-old, threw him in a garbage can. The state let him out when he was in life imprisonment. The guy then goes down and rapes a woman and makes a stabbed fiance watch. And that is an issue, that kind of thing. Do you back your cops or do you try the lenient approach? It not even in focus yet and it 's damn sure is going to be. These are values. These are things people need to know.... In terms of that issue - a furlough policy - I do n't apologize at all. <p> Williams : Thank you, Mr. President, and we hope to see you next time you 're down here. <p> Bush : I 'll be back down.
