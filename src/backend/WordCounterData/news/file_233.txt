3043541 <p> When Cleveland Scott was 10 years old he already had an airport in the front yard. Whittling wood with a pocketknife, Scott carved, painted and flew a fleet of small planes. His airport had wires strung across the air and runways for takeoffs and landings. <p> Now more than 50 years later, Scott still plays at an airport, but this one is the Cherokee County Airport in Ball Ground. The general aviation airport leases space to 100 airplanes, two flight schools and a fixed-base operation called S &S; Aviation Corp. <p> " I 've been interested in airplanes ever since I knew they existed, " said Scott. " I go up there all the time. It 's surprising how many people you can have a conversation with when you 're at the airport. " <p> A lifelong resident of Cherokee County, the 68-year-old began flying at 19 and belonged to the Cherokee Aero Club. The 20-member club owned a sleek two- passenger Piper Colt and a four-passenger Piper Tripacer. Members flew to Chattanooga and Birmingham for breakfast and went airport hopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, before the Cherokee County Airport was built in 1966, their landing strips consisted of grassy fields. <p> " We called that ' flying out of the cow pasture, ' " Scott recalled. " Often the grass was long and you would need a longer runway. Long grass slows you down. It 's good for landing but not for takeoffs. <p> " We had to be careful. We just about dragged our tails in the trees at times. " <p> Times have changed <p> Small grass and dirt strips are still located throughout the county, including the strip off Stringer Road in Hickory Flat that Cherokee Aero Club members used, but for the most part such strips have been replaced by the 3, 400-foot-long asphalt runway at Cherokee County Airport. <p> The airport, small by commercial standards, is run by the Cherokee County Airport Authority. County commissioners and the grand jury appoint the seven- member board. For years the authority and the airport were inactive, but now the airport is bursting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate its growth. <p> Last year, county commissioners paid for a $ 10,000 master plan that calls for the authority to extend the runway, add another taxiway and upgrade facilities and equipment. Board members submitted the master plan and a proposal to the FAA as a pre-application to the Airport Improvement Program grant in February. <p> The plan calls for construction of a 700-foot extension to the existing runway at the north end, followed by a 900-foot extension in 2005. The cost of the initial extension is estimated at $ 12.6 million. <p> If the plan is accepted, the federal government can fund up to 90 percent of the cost of one or all phases of construction. The county and state each will chip in 5 percent of the total. The county commissioners have included $ 80,000 in this year 's budget, contingent on the authority 's receiving federal funding. <p> " Right now we 're waiting on the FAA, " said authority Chairman George McClure. " The airport fills a niche for corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the county more accessible and attract more industry. It will be good for the county. " <p> The long and short of it <p> The short runway ca n't be used by larger commuter planes, McClure said. But as short as the runway is, the wait for funding could be a lot longer. A Cherokee Airport Authority proposal for a runway extension and taxi lane has been sitting in FAA files for more than 10 years, according to FAA Manager of Public Affairs Kathleen Bergen. <p> " There are 10 times more requests than funds available, " Bergen said. " I would n't anticipate anything in this fiscal year, and I do n't know if it will become a reality next year. It 's( the proposal) been on the drawing board, so to speak, for a long time. " <p> One reason the authority may be put off again is the recent completion of a runway extension at the Pickens County Airport. That runway extension, from 3, 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it 's fewer than 20 driving miles from the Ball Ground airport, Pickens could be considered an alternative for planes that ca n't land on the shorter runways. <p> Bergen said the hilly terrain of the Cherokee County Airport made the proposed project costlier. A steep slope and a stream are only several feet past the north end of the runway and would require fill dirt. The airport is all but surrounded by hills and valleys. <p> " Other issues come into play, too. " Bergen said. " We look at other airports in neighboring areas, and if they have similar facilities, that would be a factor we 'd consider. " <p> County Manager Lamar Hamill said that if the authority does not receive federal funding by Dec. 31, the end of this fiscal year, the allotted funds will be returned to the general fund. <p> That could spell more trouble for the proposal. FAA officials will not begin to look at submitted plans for fiscal year 2001 until after the new year, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be before the authority would be contacted. <p> However, authority members and airport personnel are optimistic that some funding for the projects will be realized. The master plan showing improvement over a 10-year period has been stamped " conditionally approved, " a first step on the long road to getting funded. <p> And the airport has received federal and state funding in the past. The FAA paid for site preparation for construction of new hangars and a new road in 1997. State funding paid for a new rotating beacon and repair of the ramps where planes park. State funds are also scheduled to purchase a new weather warning system, an All Weather Operating System, in 2001. <p> " The authority is very progressive, " said Jimmy Garland, airport manager and a partner of S &S; Aviation. The authority has charged Garland with overseeing ongoing projects at the airport and day-to-day operations. " We 're constantly getting grants. I know this whole thing is a pie in the sky, but folks at the FAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Coleman Sutton, Garland 's partner and chief executive officer of S &S; Aviation, agrees with Garland. <p> " This airport is an asset to the county, " Sutton said. " When I came here in 1984, the grass was high and there were five airplanes here. Now there are over 100, and all the hangars are full. Even in 1990, there were only 25 planes here. It 's changed a lot. " <p> Still flying after all these years <p> The airport began as a community endeavor and a symbol for progress and in many ways still is. In the ' 60s, the Canton Jaycees were instrumental in making the airport a reality. They helped build the runway, and the aero club financed the fuel pumps. <p> " We were all excited when the airport opened, " Cleveland Scott said. " We had felt that Cherokee County was somehow being overlooked, and this really felt like growth. " <p> For Cleveland Scott and his two sons, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life. Jobs, passions and hobbies are all wrapped up in the small rural airport. <p> Tony Scott, 26, and Brad Scott, 33, work as airplane mechanics at S &S.; Cleveland Scott is a retired Cherokee County building inspector and now works as an aerial photographer. Tony Scott owns his own plane and flies as much as possible. Brad Scott and his father are currently without a plane, an unusual situation. They are restoring a two-seater 1947 Veronica Champion, a classic no longer manufactured. <p> Brad Scott 's two young sons, ages 3 and 6, have flown. He readily admits his passion for flying and says his wife accuses him of eating, breathing and sleeping airplanes. But just like his father before him, he 'll let his children make their own decision. <p> " I 'm not going to force flying on them( my sons), Scott said. " And they do n't know much about it. They just grab the wheel. " <p> But whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business, the airport is a vital commodity to a small group of people. It will be up to the FAA to decide whether the numbers justify a monetary award.
