5023141 <p> Tim Eubanks has been breeding dogs -- specifically collies -- for 44 years. He started in Sunray, a Chesapeake subdivision, when he was 10 years old. <p> " I grew up on ' Lassie, ' " Eubanks said. The Lassie that Eubanks watched in the CBS television series and in the movies had certain markings that Eubanks sought to duplicate in his own breeding line. <p> But the collie breeder announced at his annual Timmy 's and Lassie 's Dog Day at the Park event on Nov. 10 that he will be retiring because of his and his wife 's health. His last litter arrived on Oct. 22. <p> For the past decade, Eubanks and his wife, Marcie Eubanks, have hosted the event at Sleepy Hole Park in Suffolk as a sort of reunion for the dogs that have been adopted from them. The Eubankses pick up the tab for the refreshments, and each year they award a plaque to the owner of the dog of distinction, the " dog who shines the most. " <p> The markings that Eubanks desires for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had. <p> " Lassie has to be a sable white collie with a full white collar, four white feet and a powder puff on its nose, with a blaze that runs up in between its ears, " he said. " Those are the markings that Rudd Weatherwax( actor, trainer, breeder) specified as every dog that he designated as his current Lassie. " <p> Eubanks has had six Lassies in his lifetime. Every time a litter produces a collie pup with the correct markings, Eubanks picks that one to be his next Lassie. He puts the other pups up for adoption. <p> " Lassie five is supposed to be here today. He 's my current reigning Lassie, " Eubanks said. " In this last litter, I 've got my eyes on Lassie seven. That will be my finale. " <p> Eubanks ' collies are so special that most members of his extended " family circle " own more than one of his collies. <p> Frances Halcrow of Chesapeake owns four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justin is the most recent addition. Ziva was named after a character on the " NCIS " television series. <p> Halcrow got her first collie -- Happy -- when she was 10 or 11. She went out into the garage and discovered that her parents had bought her a white collie. <p> " They are the most loving dogs I 've ever seen, " Halcrow said. " They are characters. They all have personalities. " <p> Graydon Andrews of Norfolk has owned six collies during his lifetime. He now owns two collies bred by Eubanks -- brothers Barclay and Gavin. The dogs, with Scottish names, are sable and white with lots of mahogany. <p> " They 're good dogs. I 've never seen a biting collie, " he said. <p> Chesapeake residents Jack and Meg Kintzing have owned collies throughout most of their married life. <p> " This is Remy LeBeau, " said Jack Kintzing, who named his dog after a fictional character associated with X-Men. <p> Collies are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Meg Kintzing. She tries to get her collies outside in the yard to throw the ball, play catch, and walk. <p> " Mine are really good about knowing their yard -- their territory -- because I will walk it with them, " Kintzing said. " Even outside our gate, they will stay right with me. They are smart. They 're easily trained. " <p> Katie Sanford drove up from South Mills, N.C., to attend Eubanks ' collie family reunion. She owns two of Eubanks ' collies. Blitz is a blue merle. J.J. is a tricolor. <p> She recalls watching the Lassie TV series in black and white with June Lockhart on Nickelodeon when she was in elementary school. Her family got their first collie when she was in middle or high school. <p> " I do enjoy these events. I 'm glad I got to come this year, " she said.
