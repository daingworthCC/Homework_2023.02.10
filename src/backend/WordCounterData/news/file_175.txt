3034041 <p> Michael Westbrook has dominated just about every defensive player he 's faced the past three years at the University of Colorado. But there is a weakness in his game. There is something he ca n't master. <p> " I have to pass chemistry first, " Westbrook said recently. " I have 12 hours, but it 's in there. It 's like I do n't even have those other classes. I 'll pass those classes. But chemistry is kicking my butt right now. " <p> That 's something few college football players have been able to do. And Westbrook, the Buffaloes ' 22-year-old wide receiver and all-time leader in receptions, yards and touchdowns, is considered by just about all NFL scouts and front-office personnel to be the top wide receiver available in next weekend 's draft. As the Washington Redskins just happen to be in the market for a receiver, he 's their number one choice at the moment if they keep the fourth pick in the first round. <p> Westbrook is the biggest prize in a deep group of talented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's J.J. Stokes, Miami 's Chris T. Jones, Auburn 's Frank Sanders and Vir ginia 's Tyrone Davis. There are smaller guys who are big playmakers, such as Ohio State 's Joey Galloway and Florida 's Jack Jackson. <p> Stokes has the ability to take over games by himself. Even though he 's been hampered by injuries, he seems to run faster in pads than in shorts. Sanders is a bit more developed as a receiver than Jones, but both have the size( 6 feet 2 and 6-3 1/2, respectively) that NFL teams are looking for in receivers. Galloway was suspended by the NCAA for the Buckeyes ' first two games last season because he accepted $ 200 from a financial adviser he hired to help him decide whether to come out for last year 's draft. But Galloway has blazing speed and great strength -- he bench presses 435 pounds -- and is high on many people 's lists. <p> But Westbrook seems to be the best combination of everything. <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical receiver, " said Tom Donohoe, director of football operations for the Pittsburgh Steelers. " The guy 's a devastating blocker. He can wipe people out in the secondary. He 's been very productive.... He 's a big-time talent. " <p> If Westbrook is taken in the first few picks of the draft, it would be flouting recent history. Only three times in the past 15 years has a team taken a wide receiver within the first five picks of the first round( Johnny " Lam " Jones, taken second overall by the Jets in 1980 ; Irving Fryar, taken first overall by the Patriots in 1984 ; and Desmond Howard, taken fourth by the Redskins in 1992). <p> Only 10 receivers overall have gone in the top 10 of the first round over that same period, but they include stars such as the Raiders ' Tim Brown, taken sixth overall in 1988 ; Sterling Sharpe, taken with the next pick that year by Green Bay ; and Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1991.( The Jets forfeited the eighth pick in the 1991 draft for having taken wide receiver Rob Moore the year before in a special supplemental draft.) <p> Washington last season had just 10 scoring plays from scrimmage longer than 25 yards, and just four during the final 10 weeks.( By contrast, the 49ers had four in the postseason alone, 19 for the season.) The Redskins have spent millions of free agent dollars bolstering their defense, but have yet to do anything for an offense that finished 17th in the league. <p> The Redskins think they have their quarterback of the future in Heath Shuler. The next offensive pieces are a dominant running back and a playmaker at wide receiver. If the Redskins ca n't trade up to take Penn State 's Ki-Jana Carter, they 'll take someone who can put the football in the end zone another way. <p> Westbrook can do that. But just as importantly for a team with a young quarterback, Westbrook can go over the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrimmage, something that other Redskins receivers have had trouble with in recent years. He can go get the football. He has become a strong downfield blocker. <p> Sounds an awful lot like Art Monk. <p> And over the past two years Westbrook has matured quite a bit as a person. Midway through his freshman year he was on academic probation, with less than a 1.3 grade point average, and had to redshirt. Now he 's close to graduating with a degree in sociology. <p> " He 's got size and speed, " Redskins General Manager Charley Cas serly said recently. " He 's physical. He had a hell of a sophomore year catching 76 passes but the last two years the system did n't dictate as many catches. " <p> Indeed, when Westbrook was a sophomore in 1992, he was the chief beneficiary of Colorado 's one-back offense. While Charles Johnson, the Steelers ' first-round pick last year, and Ray Carruth or Eric Mitchell played outside, the 6-3 1/2, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against linebackers and safeties. He finished fifth in the country in receptions. <p> " I kind of realized that I was dominant in ' 92, " Westbrook said. " There were very few people that could stop me, and I was like, ' I 'm kind of good at this. ' " <p> But the following season, Colorado abandoned the three-receiver sets in favor of run-oriented schemes that would feature the abilities of quarterback Kordell Stewart and tailback Rashaan Salaam. And what passes that were being thrown mainly were going to Johnson, by then a senior. Westbrook 's catches plummeted to 33, and people wondered what happened. <p> Actually, nothing had. Nothing that Westbrook could control, anyway. But the experience forced him to change his personality. <p> " I let myself down and I let some of my teammates down with my attitude, " he said. " I did n't talk bad about anybody ; I do n't talk about anybody now. But I was... in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anymore, they do n't throw me the ball. And then I dropped a pass at Stanford, and I was like, ' I 've got to straighten my act up. ' And I did. " <p> He took out his frustrations by battering defensive backs as a blocker. He became more team-oriented, a verbal leader. And, goaded to no end by former offensive coordinator Les Steckel, Westbrook began to improve in the classroom. A mentor tutoring program at the university helped. <p> " When he first came here he struggled -- he struggled desperately, " said Erin Hoag, the university 's assistant academic coordinator. " But in the program he learned life skills, how to plot a time/management calendar, speaking to professors, where to sit in class. Because Michael was a great student of life he picked up those things very quickly and used them to his advantage. He understood a lot. That was sort of an area that came naturally to him. He just dedicated himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Still, after that season, Westbrook weighed the pros and cons of leaving school. He interviewed potential agents. He talked about it with Johnson, one of his best friends. And to the surprise of many, Westbrook decided to return. <p> Colorado continued to run Salaam and Stewart, however, and Westbrook 's numbers did n't rise dramatically. But his best afternoon last season was the stuff of legend. At Michigan, he caught a 27-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, but the Buffaloes trailed 26-14 with 2 minutes 20 seconds left. Colorado drove 72 yards for a touchdown, held the Wolverines and had just 14 seconds left when it got the ball back -- 85 yards from a touchdown. Stewart found Westbrook over the middle for 22 yards, leaving Colorado at its 37 with six seconds left. On the game 's final play, Stewart threw the ball into the Michigan end zone. Colorado 's Blake Anderson leaped up and tipped the ball behind him, and Westbrook was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary score, giving the Buffaloes a 27-26 victory. <p> Westbrook finished that day with seven catches for 157 yards. <p> " It was slow motion, " Westbrook said. " It seemed like it was up there forever. Everything got kind of blurry. And when I caught the ball I felt like I was on the ground two or three hours. " <p> He played the last half of last season with a mid-foot sprain and finished with just three more catches than he had his junior season. But he also had almost 200 more yards and was an all-American selection by The Sporting News. After an outstanding workout at the NFL 's scouting combine in February, and another strong individual showing for scouts at Colorado last month, Westbrook 's stock has stayed high. <p> But there are a couple of questions. Westbrook will drop a pass every now and then. And, in the words of one scout, Westbrook has " a bit of a temper. " This may have shown up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university maintenance worker whom Westbrook claimed had hit his girlfriend. The Boulder County district attorney 's office filed third-degree assault charges against Westbrook on Sept. 16, 1993, after not finding enough evidence for second-degree charges. <p> In July 1994 Westbrook accepted a six-month deferred sentence for the third-degree assault charge, which was expunged earlier this year after Westbrook did n't get in any additional trouble after six months. Nonetheless, then-Colorado coach Bill McCartney, keeping with previously established team policy, suspended Westbrook from the Buffaloes ' season opener last September. <p> NFL teams are aware of the incident but think it will have no impact on Westbrook 's draft status. And a week from today, he may be in burgundy and gold. But several other teams are interested, too. Houston, where Steckel has landed as an assistant coach, could go after Westbrook with the third pick if it can not re-sign veteran Haywood Jeffires. The Rams, picking sixth, are looking for a receiver. So is Seattle, which has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But the Redskins remain hopeful, and can imagine a day when Shuler steps back and throws that 18-yard out pattern to a big, fast target who can do something with it afterward. <p> " If you 're going to throw the ball around me, I do n't care how big the defensive back is, I 've got pretty good jumps, and I 'm going to go up and get the football no matter where it is, " Westbrook said. " I do n't care about the ideas people have. All I know is about my ability and my confidence in my ability. When the ball 's up there, there 's nobody but me on the field. "
