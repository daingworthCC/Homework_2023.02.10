4190541 <h> Share story <p> Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer. To help you get in a sunny frame of mind, here are three songs you can fire up during your next barbecue or trip to the beach : <h> ' Summertime ' by DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince <p> Before he was Will Smith, SERIOUS ACTOR, he was the fly Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Along with DJ Jazzy Jeff, he produced the classic summer jam " Summertime "( 1991). It 's a laid-back ode to summer that perfectly captures a lazy summer day -- playing hoops, washing your ride and cruising the neighborhood. <h> ' Summer Nights ' by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John <p> You may call it cheesy, but I call it a classic. A new generation was introduced to the joys of the musical " Grease, " courtesy of the Fox network 's recent live remake. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John reminisce about the rosy glow of first love and those oh-so-hot( non-Seattle) " Summer Nights "( 1978).
