3040041 <p> A week from Tuesday, voters will decide whether to evict George Bush from the White House as punishment for the sluggish economy, or to trust in his plan for reviving growth. <p> But whether Mr. Bush remains as chief executive or passes the mantle to either Bill Clinton or Ross Perot, the next president will inherit an economy struggling to break free of a host of seemingly intractable ills. <p> Those troubles - the global economic downturn, the federal budget mess, the defense build-down and massive strategic corporate layoffs, to name just four - are facts of life. They have hamstrung growth for the past two years, and most economists agree that they threaten to remain an anchor on the economy for at least two more years, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. <p> In short, cleaning house at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. wo n't sweep away the pain on Main Street. <p> Off the stump, some of Mr. Clinton 's own policymakers have begun to recognize this. They are bracing voters for a long and perhaps difficult hike from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no magic wand, " said Robert Shapiro, a key economic adviser to Mr. Clinton. " You ca n't send up one piece of legislation and bring the American economy back to the health of the ' 60s. " <p> Economists say the challenge for the next administration will be to manage the economy 's problems without jinxing the seeds of growth that have been so painfully sown during our recent difficult times. <p> Businesses and households have been paying down debt, inflation has been put to rout, and interest rates have glided to a generational low. Those conditions might well have set the stage for future growth. The question the candidates have put to the voters is what role the government should play in trying to nurture that growth. <p> As with most political judgments, this will require a leap of faith : The economy is plying uncharted waters. <p> " No models can explain the types of patterns we are having, " Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said earlier this month. " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It 's an environment in which economists are just as divided as the candidates in their policy recommendations. <p> There is general agreement among investors, economists and market analysts that the basic pragmatism of Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton is far preferable to Mr. Perot 's swaggering, lemme-at-'em approach to problem- solving. <p> But on the central issue of choosing between the radically different prescriptions of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, there is no clear consensus. <p> Most economists from the free-market school agree with the basic thrust of Mr. Bush 's approach - to put great faith in the private sector to sort out its problems with a minimum of government input. <p> These are tough times, the president concedes, but the economy is undergoing essential changes. Let the market do its work, he implores, and the economy will emerge the stronger for it. <p> The economists who agree with him point out that government can not create growth, output, jobs or anything else. What it does instead is to confiscate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and reallocate those resources along politically expedient lines. <p> All too often, these economists warn, politicians spend money inefficiently, thus denying the private sector precious resources needed to create its own jobs or to improve wages and benefits for existing workers. <p> But Mr. Clinton sees a far broader role for government - one in which government steps in with a combination of incentives and requirements to help direct the private economy along the lines of a long- term growth strategy. <p> And he misses no opportunity to point out that 556 economists, including nine Nobel Prize winners, have endorsed the basic ideas of his plan. For doubters, he will provide a list of their names. <p> Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, for example, is a recent convert to Mr. Clinton 's proposal to help jump-start the economy by injecting $ 20 billion per year of additional spending into public works projects such as highways, bridges and railroads. <p> Dr. Blinder says he used to reject such schemes as budget-busters. But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates alone wo n't get the economy going again. The government must step in, he believes, to try to spark vigorous growth in the short term, and follow up with efforts to improve long-term productivity through programs like worker retraining and apprenticeships for high school students who are n't going to college. <p> " The main engine of economic growth is going to be private business. Nobody questions that, " said Dr. Blinder. " But government can help smooth the path. " <p> Mr. Clinton blames Mr. Bush for neglecting problems that lie near the heart of the economy 's ills. A better-educated work force, for instance, could improve living standards for everyone, he argues. <p> The Democratic nominee also appears to have sold the electorate on the idea that Mr. Bush has overseen the wholesale export of American jobs to foreign factories, and he speaks in vague terms of curtailing that movement. Many economists wonder, however, how government might usefully throttle corporate decisions to move production where it is most cost- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And, as Mr. Bush began pointing out last week with renewed fervor, the global economy is a two-edged sword. U.S. manufacturers exported $ 422 billion worth of goods last year, a record high, and are on their way toward hitting $ 440 billion this year. <p> Yet there 's a problem with Mr. Bush 's touting of America 's export potential : The much-heralded global economy is not faring so well. <p> The United Kingdom is staggering through its second year of contraction, and growth rates in both Germany and Japan are trailing the U.S. rate. Overall growth for the world 's 24 richest nations is projected to reach somewhere between 1.5 percent and 2.1 percent this year and next, about the same range as is forecast for the United States. <p> " We 're all in it together, " said Stephen Waite, vice president for international economics at Merrill Lynch &; Co., the New York investment firm. <p> Phasing out jobs <p> The old rule of thumb was that each billion dollars worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always hold - especially with major corporations demanding expanded output from a shrinking work force to remain competitive with foreign rivals. <p> The IBM Corp., Caterpillar Inc., the Compaq Computer Corp. and the Du Pont Co. are among dozens of major corporations phasing out jobs by the thousands, either scaling down operations or replacing workers with new machines and methods. They must streamline to compete with aggressive foreign rivals, or downsize because they 've lost market share, or a combination of both. <p> Does that mean that it 's time to stimulate growth and put people back to work with the kinds of public works programs that Mr. Clinton has advocated? <p> Critics of the Clinton approach warn that such government stimulus is like a drug ; the more it 's used, the less effect it has on the patient. <p> Wake-up call <p> Indeed, Mr. Clinton got a rude wake-up call from the money markets last week. After the governor 's repeated emphasis on stimulating the economy through his $ 20 billion-per-year " Rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own : Do n't break the bank with opulent spending, or interest rates will rise. <p> " The financial markets are recognizing the fact that with a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, it 's going to be very hard to hold the line on spending, " a Treasury Department official said. " A Democratic Congress is going to control a Democratic president. They 've been stifled for 12 years, and there are a lot of programs they want to fund. " <p> Little Rock took notice. <p> " There is no short-term stimulus package, " Mr. Shapiro of the Clinton campaign insisted Tuesday, after three days of rising interest rates on the bond market. " There 's not one sitting on the shelf, there 's not one in planning. <p> " It 's not as if we are theologically against stimulus, " Mr. Shapiro added. " The question is, how can you stimulate when you 've got a $ 330 billion deficit? " <p> Depressed confidence <p> All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazed by small, medium and new businesses. That 's where the most dynamic job growth has come from in recent years, and each candidate has developed his own formula of tax breaks and other measures aimed at helping to expand the sector. <p> But slow growth, high unemployment and a general mood of anxiety have depressed confidence for consumers and business leaders alike - not the sort of environment that encourages risk-taking. <p> That 's why psychology could prove just as important as economic theory in getting the economy back on track. <p> As Michael J. Boskin, the president 's chief economic adviser, has grown fond of saying, " Economics is not an exact science. " No one can rightly tell what it might take to reverse the pessimism and gloom that perpetuate a self-fulfilling prognosis for a sputtering economy. <p> ' Table 's been set ' <p> Ironically for Mr. Bush, some observers now say it could take a new administration - a change in strategy, substance, staffing and style - to ignite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental strengths. They argue that consumer confidence might improve in the early months of a Clinton presidency, simply because people would perceive a top-level effort to do something about the problems besetting the economy. <p> " The table 's been set, " argues international financier and bestselling author Paul Erdman. " All we need is a dynamic host. " <p> Bob Deans is a Journal-Constitution staff writer.
