3054641 <p> CALCUTTA, India - The truest tribute to Mother Teresa Saturday was in the streets of her adopted city. <p> While cardinals, queens, diplomats and politicians paid homage in a state funeral that stressed her devotion to the have-nots of the world - but included few of them - tens of thousands of poor and working-class Indians assembled behind barricades to watch her cortege pass. <p> Cardinal Angelo Sodano, second to the pope in the Roman Catholic Church, led the celebration of Mother Teresa 's funeral Mass, and praised her devotion to the gospel of love. <p> " She understood it with every fiber of her indomitable spirit and every ounce of energy in her frail body, " he said. " She practiced it with her whole heart and through the daily toil of her hands. " <p> He spoke to an audience that included scores of dignitaries - including three queens and three presidents - as well as hundreds of nuns, dozens of priests, squadrons of military officers and their wives, legions of volunteers who managed to get one of the 12,000 tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and one leper. <p> Outside, richshaw puller Ram Lakhan Yadav spent half a day 's wage - 25 rupees, about 70 cents - to buy a garish poster of Mother Teresa printed on slick paper. He will post it to a wall next to the sidewalk where he sleeps. <p> " Who knows? She may save me from poverty, " Yadav said. " Maybe, if I put up her picture, the police will stop harassing me, thinking me to be one of her subjects. " <p> Yadav was one of an estimated 150,000 people who gathered under sullen skies, beginning about 8 a.m. local time, to watch the funeral procession. Two hours later, the air was soupy with humidity and car exhaust. A downpour from thunderstorms later in the morning did little to clear the air ; by the time the funeral cortege had returned Mother Teresa 's body to her home, the line between high humidity and drizzle was hard to discern. <p> Mother Teresa 's body, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried on a military gun carriage to Netaji Indoor Stadium for the funeral. The same gun carriage was used to carry the bodies of Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru to their cremations. On the way back from the service, her coffin was draped with plastic, to keep out the rain. <p> " Mother Teresa Zindabad! " shouted the sodden crowd, as the cortege passed. " Long live Mother Teresa! " <p> The stadium, which was chosen in part because it is air-conditioned, remained comfortable - although several dignitaries, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, took out fans during the final hour of the three-hour service. <p> The wooden floor of the stadium, built in 1975 for an international table-tennis tournament, was carpeted for the occasion. Red plush couches and armchairs were brought in for the highest-ranking dignitaries. <p> A simple plywood bier was covered in white cotton and painted with the blue-stripe trim of Mother Teresa 's sari. The backdrop to the altar was white satin with the same blue trim. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singh, a longtime associate of Mother Teresa 's, completed the painting on 24 hours ' notice. The light dusting of glitter in Jesus ' loincloth, she said, would give the painting depth. As to her part in the funeral : " I 'm just a little teardrop. " <p> The service capped eight days of grieving for the 87-year-old nun, who earned the nickname " Saint of the Gutters " for her devotion to the destitute and dying. About 500,000 viewed her body during the week at St. Thomas ' Church ; when the doors to the small church were finally closed to the public, Mother Teresa 's religious community prayed there through the night, with back-to-back Masses. <p> After Saturday 's ceremony, she was buried in the foundation of her order 's Mother House - a place that is now expected to become a shrine. <p> The funeral combined the Catholic rituals that Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity desired and the state funeral that India 's prime minister insisted she deserved. <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military ceremony and the mystery of the religious service - as well as tedious moments drawn from both traditions. <p> The laying of wreaths by about four dozen diplomatic guests consumed 45 minutes. Military honor guards goose-stepped to Mother Teresa 's coffin carrying white flower wreaths( white is the color of mourning in India) and thrust them at the dignitaries, who were called up one by one. <p> The president of Albania was first, then the presidents of Ghana and Italy, next the prime minister of Bangladesh and the queens of Spain, Belgium and Jordan, down through the ranks of ambassadors and ministers and personal representatives. Each VVIP - very, very important person, as they are called here - propped a wreath against Mother Teresa 's bier. As soon as the VVIP turned away, the wreath was removed to make room for the next. <p> The service was conducted in three languages - Hindi, English and Bengali - which slowed the pace. Hindi and English are the most commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calcutta. <p> Despite the crowd 's size, participation in the prayers and songs was light - perhaps because Catholics are a tiny minority in India, and many of Mother Teresa 's supporters were not of her faith. During Communion, in which Catholics eat bread and drink wine, several people in the crowd were heard to ask, " What are they eating? " <p> But there were moments of warmth. <p> Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa 's successor as head of the order, came to the podium barefooted after making a symbolic offering of an empty chalice at the altar. Slight and bespectacled, she worked 39 years with Mother Teresa. <p> " With this empty chalice, Lord, we offer you the emptiness of our hearts, " she said. " Fill us all with the fullness of Mother Teresa 's spirit, so that we may live her vision that recognized the preciousness of human life. " <p> On her way to her seat, Sister Nirmala tenderly laid her hand on Mother Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth as she walked away. <p> Sister Nirmala 's chalice was the last of eight offerings meant to symbolize elements of Mother Teresa 's work - and to give her flock, " the poorest of the poor, " their only official role in her final farewell. The official program specified that offerings would be made by a leper, a mentally ill woman, an orphaned child and a handicapped person. <p> Mother Teresa, noted Calcutta Archbishop Henry D'Souza, lived by the Gospel according to Matthew : " I was hungry and you gave me food ; I was thirsty and you gave me drink ; I was a stranger and you welcomed me ; I was naked and you clothed me ; I was sick and you visited me ; I was in prison and you came to me.... As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me. " <p> Sister Nirmala picked up on the theme : " God loved the world so much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " And Jesus loved the poorest of the poor so much, he gave us our Mother, Mother Teresa of Calcutta. " <p> Mother Teresa had an unbroken commitment to the destitute, Sister Nirmala said : " The hungry, the thirsty, the sick and the dying, the orphans, the leprosy sufferers, those of broken bodies and broken minds and broken hearts - these were the special objects of Mother 's love. " <p> At the end of the service, leaders of the six major religions in India offered their prayers, the wreaths were laid, and the five celebrants of the Mass sprinkled Mother Teresa 's body with holy water and smoked the air around her with incense. A choir of nuns sang lamentations. <p> Outside, the crowds surged forward against stout bamboo barricades for another look at the coffin bearing the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as her cortege passed. Many offered namaste - a prayerful lifting of the hands - as it went by. <p> At an intersection that was a prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throngs. He had shaved his head for Mother Teresa, a common Hindu mark of respect and sacrifice. Less traditional was the paint job. Giri had painted blue stripes - one wide, two narrow - around his face, in imitation of Mother Teresa 's sari, and had written " I love you, Mother Teresa " in blue and white across his skull. <p> A group of small boys, Muslim orphans, held handmade placards that said " Long Live the Goddess of Humanity, Mother Teresa. " <p> Kalpana Mondol pushed through the crowded sidewalks, clutching a hastily gathered bouquet. She lives an hour away by train, but she said she had to come. <p> " I just could not sit at home - the Mother called me here, to pay my last respects. May her soul find everlasting peace and happiness. " <p> Near the Mother House, Albert Bapi Das cried. <p> " I was not as pained when I lost my parents - they were humans and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?
