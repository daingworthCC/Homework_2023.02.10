4115141 Is credit union chief 's compensation really so bad? # Re : " Credit unions have strayed from their mission, " April 15 letter to the editor. # Don Childears, president and chief executive of the Colorado Bankers Association, correctly states that the Public Service Credit Union has strayed from its mission by awarding $11 million in compensation to its CEO. However, Mr. Childears then obfuscates his point by inferring that all credit unions are similar to PSCU, and their non-profit status should be challenged. That could not be further from the truth. The overwhelming vast majority of credit unions are serving customers in a fiscally sound manner, providing vital services that banks can not or will not provide, unless they charge the customer an arm or a leg for them. I would welcome a comparison of the compensation packages between credit union CEOs and bank CEOs. It might embarrass Mr. Childears. # Painting all credit unions with the PSCU brush is both disingenuous and terribly misleading. # Ray Ingraham, Colorado City # * * * # It 's not surprising the Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face it : This one-time payout for 33 years of dedicated and visionary service pales in comparison to a banking industry plagued with excessive pay and bonuses. Bank executives still receive far greater compensation than credit union leaders. Banks were one of the contributors to the financial collapse spurred by questionable lending and less than sound business decisions. # Credit unions have never strayed from their original intent of serving the interest of their members and being safe financial harbors, formed to serve people of all walks -- including those of modest means that the banks have turned their backs on. This has resulted in more than $83 million of savings to Colorado families in the past year through lower fees and better rates. # Scott Earl, DenverThe writer is president and chief executive of the Mountain West Credit Union Association.Read another letter on this topic at **29;7882;TOOLONG # One-size-fits-all fracking regulations wo n't work # There is no way that geologists and engineers can form regulations and procedures that apply to the myriad geologic basins throughout the United States.

What about the right to clean air? # Re : " Smokers should n't have to walk a mile, " April 17 editorial. # In your editorial, you take the interesting position that science is on the side of smoke-free policies ; you give arguments supporting the cost-effectiveness of smoke-free policies ; you show evidence that exposure to even trace amounts of secondhand smoke can negatively impact health ; you encourage municipalities to expand areas outside of doorways that must be smoke-free ; and you claim you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then you advocate for policies that will allow smokers to continue smoking in outdoor public places.

" # Those of us " smoke-free types who are pushing our freedom to breathe clean air " enthusiastically support that argument, and the default position should be one of clean, smoke-free air -- especially in a state known for its pristine environment, for which many of its citizens chose to make it their home.
