3001741 <p> On Arden Street, people begin to climb out of their windows and onto their fire escapes in the morning, to take that first sip of coffee, to make that first check of the northern Manhattan weather. Afternoons, they come out in greater numbers and for longer spells, cultivating plants, draping laundry and gazing down at the children playing volleyball or stickball. <p> The nurses, doormen and transit workers of Arden boomerang back to Inwood just before sunset. They unwind on their fire escapes, a cold Corona or a warm plate of rice and beans in hand. Then, as the slatted shadows of the escapes thicken with the encroaching darkness, their children observe their own fire escape rituals : undulating to Dominican music and hip-hop, bantering with earthbound friends below and barking into their cellphones, their faces bathed in a warm blue light. <p> For many a summer, New Yorkers have gravitated toward urban platforms like rooftops and balconies to rise, quite literally, above the din of the sidewalks so that they can repose and reflect. But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooftop access, the humble fire escape has always been the next best thing. It is their makeshift stoop in the sky. <p> How much longer that tradition will thrive remains to be seen. Fire escapes are gradually becoming obsolete because new buildings must typically have fireproof interior stairs. Fire escapes are also rarely used anymore as outdoor sleeping spaces in the stifling heat, because of air-conditioning and other comforts. <p> But in many pockets across the city, people still do their resourceful best to transform their fire escapes into practical, personalized annexes. And one of the best places to observe such devotion and ingenuity is a one-block stretch on Arden Street, between Sherman and Nagle Avenues. <p> Even in an unseasonably cool summer, people on this predominantly Dominican street have taken their rightful places in the " box seats, " as they are called by Robert Diaz, a longtime resident who is, by acclamation, the street 's biggest Yankees fanatic. For the past few summers, as well, the Police Athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's activities, thereby attracting even more residents to watch from their escapes. <p> It is almost as if each fire escape, with its vertebrae of landings and ladders, functions as an exterior spine, reinforcing safety and stability, while nurturing the lives of its hosts. <p> " These fire escapes are like lifelines, " said Donna Joseph, a 43-year-old nurse who lived on Arden Street all her life until moving last month. " That 's our terrace. Terrace of Arden. " <p> The fire escape has been an icon, good and bad, since it emerged in mid-19th-century New York as the embodiment of the city 's inescapable density. It gained wider acceptance in the late 1920 's, after a series of deadly fires, when the city began to enforce tough rules requiring that all buildings be outfitted with a fire escape or a second, enclosed stairwell. <p> The New York Times reported in 1927 that " a hot night reveals hundreds of east siders sleeping alfresco " on their escapes and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own level, laughter and the latest gossip float pleasantly up and down. " Later, Broadway and Hollywood associated the fire escape with the city 's dangerous and romantic possibilities in classics like " Rear Window, " " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " and " West Side Story. " <p> But by the 1970 's, fire escapes fell into disfavor because of complaints about burglaries, aesthetics and obstructed views. The city 's 1968 building code did not allow fire escapes for new construction projects, with a few exceptions, because interior stairs were deemed superior. <p> No one is sure exactly how many fire escapes are left ; Vincent J. Dunn, a retired deputy chief with New York City 's Fire Department, guesses there may be 200,000. But only a few places -- including Washington Heights, in the vicinity of Audubon Avenue near 190th Street, and Inwood, east of Broadway -- appear to have a critical mass of habitues. <p> The Ups and Downs of 45 Arden <p> It is easy to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-way thoroughfare that looks no different from the typical Inwood block of four- and five-story residential walk-ups. On the ground level, throngs of people, young and old, always seem to be socializing outside, either in their chairs or on the sidewalks. Above them, apartment dwellers bob their heads in and out of their windows and see who is doing what on the street. <p> There are 28 street-side fire escapes lining 22 buildings that face each other. They come in hues of maroon and chocolate, aquamarine and sea green. But the fire escape with the most traffic, hands down, belongs to 45 Arden, a five-story walk-up, which is part of a bigger complex of about 70 rent-stabilized apartments. <p> Each landing is shared by two apartments, though one apartment usually dominates the space. On the first floor, there is Kathy Santos, who has lived on the block for 27 of her 34 years. Ms. Santos, a stay-at-home mother, often heads out with a cup of morning coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach. <p> Later, she waters her plants and watches her three children play on the escape. Even later, she allows her oldest child, Josyline Guzman, 11, to stay out there until 2 a.m. or later and mingle with friends on the street. <p> The fire escape landing is almost like an extra room measuring 3 1/2 feet wide by 10 1/2 feet long, wrapped by a 2 1/2-foot-high railing. <p> " That 's my little place, " Ms. Santos said. " When I 'm into a conversation, I 'll sit on the fire escape, talking on the phone. " <p> Sometimes, Ms. Santos or Josyline ends up talking with Janina Tias, the de facto inhabitant of the next escape up. De facto, because Janina, 15, actually lives in another apartment in the same complex, with a fire escape that unceremoniously faces the rear. But Janina is so close to the people on the second floor that she uses their escape constantly to do her homework or braid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow out there. <p> The third floor is the quietest, even though the tenants there do air-dry their laundry. But one floor up, on the right side of the escape, is Veronica Tirado, 21, who sometimes climbs down to chat with Ms. Santos.( But not vice versa, Ms. Santos said. " I 'm afraid of heights. ") <p> On the other side is the family of Ivan Caseres. Mr. Caseres frequently leans out the window to look and smile at friends ; his father, Juan, grows tomatoes on the fire escape, and sometimes sits there at dusk to meditate. <p> Finally, the top floor belongs to the extended family of Miguelina Uribe, 11. Almost every evening, Miguelina and her cousins -- chiefly Coco Pimentel, 13, and his sister, Lisenny, 11 -- go outside on the iron balcony. Sometimes, they scribble notes and toss them to eager friends who look like specks on the sidewalk. Other times, they drop packets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are eating outdoors. <p> Follow the dialogue, for instance, on a recent Saturday night, when the cousins engaged in a three-way conversation with Josyline, on the first-floor fire escape, and some friends on the street. <p> JOSYLINE : Miguelina, you 're too loud! What are you doing? <p> MIGUELINA : Nothing! <p> JOSYLINE : Call me! <p> MIGUELINA : Daniel!( She was calling down to Daniel Parker, 14, another Arden mainstay.) Stupid! <p> DANIEL : Miguelina, write me a letter! <p> According to the city 's Department of Buildings, a building 's fire escape should accommodate up to 30 people. Although many fire escapes, which are the responsibility of the landlord, appear to be in raggedy condition, veteran housing and building inspectors say that they can not recall any collapses because of structural weaknesses or neglect. <p> On Arden Street, most escapes are devoid of clutter. Only a handful on the entire block hold as much as a few toys, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird cage. No one can recall seeing a neighbor barbecuing on the fire escape, an illegal activity that the Fire Department warns is dangerous, and subject to immediate enforcement. <p> In the past year, code inspectors from the city 's Department of Housing Preservation and Development issued 1,013 violations throughout the city for items blocking the way on a fire escape, like bicycles, flowerpots or clotheslines. Earlier this summer, an inspector did ask Ms. Santos to remove some of her 20 or so plants. <p> Ms. Santos readily complied because she wants to keep the fire escape open for safety reasons, and for her own enjoyment. A storage locker, the fire escape is not. <p> Happy Hours and Alfresco Dining <p> They venture out during the baseball playoffs -- especially if the Yankees are involved. They do so at Christmastime to refrigerate soda and food, and to mount holiday lights. But the season with the greatest mileage, of course, is summer. And the busiest time of the busiest season is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak. <p> It is the neighborhood 's answer to happy hour, with alfresco dining and drinking always an option. <p> It is a time for stickball, courtesy of the men and boys of Dominican and Puerto Rican heritage. They live on the more established northwestern half of the block, closer to Broadway and the Hudson River, away from the soccer-partial southeastern half of recent Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants. " It 's like you 're in the stadium, in the bleachers, " said Mr. Diaz, the Yankees fan. " You 're yelling, ' Hey, you ca n't hit! You stink! " ' <p> It is a time for loud music. This summer, Ms. Santos has been obsessed with " Pobre Diabla " by Don Omar, a popular Puerto Rican singer. " That 's the national anthem, " she said. " I play it every day. " <p> It is a time for people like Miguelina. On a recent Friday, with the sun slowly fading, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining them on her friends. <p> What, pray tell, did she write? Her friend, Leslie Grullon, who moved away from the block to the Bronx last year, revealed that they touched on " what to wear, " " when are you going to the pool, " that kind of thing. <p> And it is time, too, for people like Iris Miranda of 35 Arden, who is a fixture up there on Fridays and Mondays. She is off those days from her job at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, where she scans medical information. <p> Ms. Miranda, 44, an Arden lifer, calls the fire escape her penthouse, with its pleasant breezes and lovely views of Fort Tryon Park. A serious Mets fan, she hangs a team banner over the fire escape every baseball season. <p> Her younger daughter, Amanda, who is 11, has whiled away many hours up there with her cousin and best friend, Natasha Ortiz, 15. Amanda knows that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should hang on to the railing. <p> Oh, and one more safety rule, her mother adds : " No partying! " <p> On one recent afternoon, the two girls slurped ice cream sodas, legs swinging from the fire escape, eyes glued to the clothes that their neighbors were wearing on the street. Natasha was playing her own brand of commercial-free FM radio, constantly switching between hip-hop and Top 40 stations. <p> Another afternoon, Amanda was reading a book assigned to her for her coming seventh-grade class at Mott Hall, a school in upper Manhattan for gifted children. Her mother came outside later. <p> " Right now, I 'm so happy, just sitting out here, " Ms. Miranda said. " This is the best thing you can get. It 's like our home. " <p> She looked at her watch. " Oh, I have to make dinner. That 's what happens -- time just goes by. " <p> The Last of the Mohicans <p> On Arden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even those who do n't have them want them. Those who do, meanwhile, say that the escapes are conducive to daydreaming and help to foster neighborhood loyalty. <p> Mr. Diaz can relate to all of that. As a bachelor and the unofficial mayor and neighborhood watchdog of Arden, he lives on the ground floor of 45 Arden. But he has visited just about all of the fire escapes, since he helps his brother-in-law, Carmelo Ortiz Jr., the building superintendent, with maintenance. <p> " I got to get me settled, get a wife, get a fire escape, " said Mr. Diaz, who, at 39, has had three heart operations. <p> Like just about everyone else on Arden, Mr. Diaz fondly said that the culture of fire escapes may have peaked last summer during the blackout, when neighbors ate, drank and slept outside. And yet, for all of that short-term community bonding, some longtime residents sense that the street is on the cusp of transition. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arden was addled with drug dealing and other troubles. But after the police cracked down, and the Police Athletic League established a summer presence, residents began to reclaim their fire escapes. And now, artists and white-collar professionals from Greenwich Village and Chelsea are gentrifying the neighborhood, attracted by the advantageous rents, the proximity to the 1, 9 and A subway lines and the beauty of Fort Tryon Park. <p> The median household income in the area is $20,300 ; the city 's is $38,300. The median rent is $600, according to census data. But already, some three-bedroom rentals on Arden Street cost as much as $1,800 a month. <p> Soon, a new tenant will also replace Ms. Joseph, the last member of her family to leave a block where they first settled in 1940. At the end of July, she ; her companion, Al DellaValle ; and her twin 13-year-old boys left their $675-a-month apartment at 44 Arden for a comparably priced one on 168th Street affiliated with her employer, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But she misses her friends. <p> And few, if any, of the newcomers have embraced the fire-escape tradition. <p> " We 're the last of the Mohicans because 10 years from now, they wo n't have this as much, " Ms. Joseph said. <p> Ms. Miranda is preparing to move on, as well. She is sorting out the family 's finances, and hoping to buy a two-family house within a few years : half for her, her husband, Ralph, and Amanda ; the other half for her 26-year-old daughter, Janice, an administrative assistant at J.P. Morgan. <p> Not long ago, Mr. Miranda took Amanda to his job as a doorman at 70 East 10th Street, in a Greenwich Village neighborhood where two-bedroom apartments can top $1 million. He escorted her to one resident 's outdoor terrace, and taught her how to water the plants properly. <p> He also told her that if she studied hard and chased her dreams, then maybe someday she would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one, and not just on her beloved fire escape. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Amanda Miranda, 11, whiles away the hours on a fire escape above Arden Street in Inwood. Her mother has set a few rules for going out on the landing, stressing an important one : " No partying! " Residents of the neighborhood have resourcefully turned their fire escapes into personalized annexes. Although some fire escapes on Arden Street are used as open-air clothes dryers, most on the block between Sherman and Nagle Avenues are devoid of clutter. Only a handful hold as much as a few toys, a folding chair or, in one case, a bird cage.( Photographs by RUTH FREMSON/The New York Times)( pg. 38) Above, a family looks out on a Monday morning on Arden, the fire escapes seem to have a gravitational pull.
