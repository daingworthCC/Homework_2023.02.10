3029141 <p> NEW YORK -- He 's a former chief Navy chaplain and one of Catholic America 's most prominent conservatives ; she was a pacifist and one of its most prominent radicals. <p> Yet Cardinal John O'Connor says he thinks Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker movement, is a saint. <p> And he 's trying to make her one. <p> In an interview, O'Connor said his belief in Day 's saintliness was bolstered last month by a private meeting with some of the people who shot down her cause when it was first raised in the mid- ' 80s : Day 's own followers. <p> They were only following her wishes. <p> " Do n't call me a saint! " she 'd snap. " I do n't want to be dismissed that easily. " <p> Saints, she feared, were regarded as good enough to be admired, but too good to be emulated. <p> Day, too, was a hard act to follow. She spent a half century in bad New York neighborhoods, caring for and living with people everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane, the penniless, the aged and the broken. <p> She inspired many others across the nation to found their own Catholic Worker " houses of hospitality. " There are now about 140 such shelters and soup kitchens. <p> But was she a saint? Her horror at being called one, O'Connor says, is itself a saintly attribute. And now, 18 years after Day 's death, Catholic Workers like those O'Connor met last month seem to agree. <p> " In the ' 80s, her words still echoed in my ears : ' Do n't make a plaster saint out of me, ' " says Tom Cornell, 64, who met Day in 1953. " But we see things differently now. She seems more and more clearly to be a model of holiness that should be held up. " <p> Which seems to explain why O'Connor, who served as chaplain with the Marines in Vietnam and wrote a book justifying the war, would champion a woman who was jailed for protesting it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day 's life before formally contacting the Vatican to begin the long process of canonization. And, while he promises to keep an open mind, he says : " My bones tell me that now is the time for presenting her cause.... If anybody in our time can be called a saint, she can. " <p> Day died in 1980, a half century after she co-founded the Catholic Worker movement. Its most visible symbols are the Catholic Worker newspaper, a monthly that charges 25 cents for a year 's subscription, and its houses of hospitality, famed for taking the most wretched off the streets. <p> The Catholic Worker ideal, espoused by her as editor of the Catholic Worker, attracts many volunteers, most of them young, who work at a house of hospitality for a few years and move on. They leave something of themselves behind, and take something of Day with them. <p> In her day, she offended conservatives with her critique of American capitalism( " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals with her obedience to church teaching and leaders( " If the bishop told me to shut down, I would do so today "). <p> Almost no one could stomach her absolute pacifism. She even opposed America 's battle against Hitler, and was ostracized by mainstream Catholicism for more than a decade. <p> It came as a surprise, then, when Cardinal O'Connor -- a retired rear admiral with a hawkish reputation on military issues -- announced in November that he was thinking about proposing Day for sainthood and would meet with her followers and friends to discuss it. <p> The meeting was more than a formality. When a religious order first suggested Day 's canonization a few years after her death, mail ran only 4-3 in favor -- hardly the kind of popular support needed for such a cause. <p> Many Catholic Workers viewed the saint-making process as a distraction ; time and money, they said, would be better spent on soup kitchens. <p> How did they feel now? As his seven guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure. <p> ' A great model of a Catholic ' <p> O'Connor 's view of what constitutes a " just war " under Christian doctrine had narrowed. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991 and spoke out against the use of force against Iraq this year. <p> Part of that, he said, was the influence of Dorothy Day. And now, he told her followers, " I do n't want to have on my conscience that I did n't do what God wanted done. " <p> He found they felt the same way. <p> " It 's good that the question sat for a while, " said Robert Ellsberg, a former editor of the Catholic Worker. " Now it 's possible to see that she had a message for both conservatives and progressives. " <p> Conservatives, once outraged by Day 's leftist economics, increasingly agree. " She 's a great model of a Catholic who valued church teaching, " says Curtis Martin, president of Catholics United for the Faith. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals to live a principled life. " <p> It typically takes decades, or longer, to make a saint. A candidate 's cause must be advocated by a local bishop and move through a slow, quasi-judicial process designed to determine if the person is really a " heroic model of Christian holiness, " as church doctrine requires. <p> If such evidence is found, it is passed on to a Vatican tribunal. Usually, there must be evidence of several miracles, usually inexplicable healings attributable to the candidate 's intercession with God. <p> Only three Americans have been made saints -- a bishop and two nuns. Dozens of others are at some stage of the process. <p> None, however, was like Dorothy Day : a laywoman who, at various points before her conversion, had an abortion, got divorced and bore a child out of wedlock. <p> After a hedonistic youth in Greenwich Village, Day converted to Catholicism in 1927. Six years later she and a French immigrant named Peter Maurin founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with a global circulation. <p> Day put out the newspaper and lived its credo. She stayed in cold water flats and wore secondhand clothes. She said caring for the poor was not a burden, but a privilege. <p> Her last public speech was to decry, in front of patriotic Catholics gathered in Philadelphia for the nation 's Bicentennial in 1976, the selection of Aug. 6, Hiroshima Day, to honor Catholics in the military. <p> She loved the church, even though, she said, " it was so often a scandal to me. " She sided with striking grave diggers at cemeteries run by the New York archdiocese, bringing her afoul of Cardinal Francis Spellman, a power broker who had crushed far mightier churchmen for far less. <p> Spellman never raised a finger against Day, and everyone knew why : He was afraid he might be dealing with a saint. <p> She was an orthodox Catholic who went to communion every day and to confession every week. She said the Rosary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking for Lent. <p> Once, when the radical Jesuit Daniel Berrigan tried to say Mass at a Catholic Worker farm in New England dressed only in street clothes, she refused to allow the service to begin until he had donned the proper vestments. <p> " On this farm, " she reminded him, " we obey the laws of the church. " <p> Not a well-known figure <p> Her many uncompromising stands have left Day, for all her admirers, marginal and obscure. <p> She was never invited to address the national bishops ' conference, and not one Catholic prelate attended her funeral in 1980. <p> The writer Coleman McCarthy speaks frequently at Catholic schools. " No one knows who she is, " he complains. " They say, ' Oh yeah, she was in Pillow Talk with Rock Hudson. ' They think she 's Doris Day. " <p> Advocates say her canonization could help change that. <p> O'Connor, for instance, says Day could become " the patron saint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but who later converted and came to oppose the practice. <p> What miracles might be attributed to St. Dorothy of the Bowery? <p> As a student, Harvard psychologist Robert Coles worked with Day. Years later, when his wife, Jane, was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor, he wrote his old mentor. <p> Although Day was busier than ever -- Vietnam was raging and drugs had invaded her neighborhood -- each day she mailed the Coleses her prayers for Jane 's recovery. <p> Months became years, and Jane Coles ' doctors started talking about her miraculous recovery. <p> Looking back, Coles has written, " The only one who did n't tell me my wife was going to die in six months was Dorothy Day.
