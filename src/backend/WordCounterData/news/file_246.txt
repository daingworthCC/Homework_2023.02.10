3045541 <p> REGION 8-AAAAA <p> 2004 Gwinnett playoff teams : Brookwood, Central Gwinnett, South Gwinnett, Grayson <p> BERKMAR PATRIOTS <p> Coach : Mike Lancaster( fourth year) <p> 2004 record : 11-22 <p> Returning starters : 5 <p> Key players : Brittany Boeshore( Sr., 3B), Samantha Boeshore( Jr., C), Erica Joseph( Jr., SS), Carrie Smith( Jr., 2B), Catherine Tarvin( So., P) <p> Outlook : Four-year starter Brittany Boeshore leads a solid returning cast. The Patriots, however, need to find capable players at first base and the outfield. Tarvin is a college pitching prospect who again will start almost every game. " Without her last year, we may not win a game, " Lancaster said. " How she goes will determine to a great deal how we go. " <p> BROOKWOOD BRONCOS <p> Coach : Bill Batchelor( fifth year) <p> 2004 record : 41-3, region champs, most wins ever in Georgia, state runner-up <p> Returning starters : 2 <p> Key players : Alex Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1B), Karla Alt( Sr., P, 6-0), Alex Erisman( Sr., 3B), Richele Pugh( Sr., LF), Jade Littleton( Sr., C), Vanessa Roman( Sr., CF) <p> Outlook : Losing Player of the Year Lisa Norris -- now at North Carolina after posting a 0.11 ERA and striking out 389 last year -- and a slew of other starters evens the playing field for the rest of the region. Still, Brookwood has built the kind of program that wo n't suddenly fall apart. " After graduating 18 people in two years, I think people have written us off, " Batchelor said. " Our goal is still to make a run at the playoffs. Once you get in, anything can happen. " <p> CENTRAL GWINNETT BLACK KNIGHTS <p> Coach : Kris Daniels( first year) <p> 2004 record : 20-15, reached North sectionals <p> Returning starters : 6 <p> Key players : Klair Wells( Sr., SS,.390, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessica Skeels( Sr., CF,.290, 9 RBIs), Lacy Reck( Sr., P, 11-4, 1.28 ERA), Ashley Razey( So., P/1B,.288, 15 RBIs), Katie Chamness( Sr., C) <p> Outlook : The Black Knights have set a goal of winning the regular-season region title, and with their talent that 's possible. Wells is the catalyst. She puts opponents on edge with her rare combination of speed and pop. Look for Central to play an aggressive, entertaining style. " I want them to be aggressive at the plate, on the bases, playing defense, " Daniels said. " Make the other team make plays to beat us. " <p> GRAYSON RAMS <p> Coach : Troy Pirkle( second year) <p> 2004 record : 20-18, reached North sectionals <p> Returning starters : 7 <p> Key players : Melissa Davis( Jr., 3B, 9 RBIs), Mallory Johnson( Sr., 1B, 10 RBIs), Shelley Bender( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RBIs), Megan Matuszak( Sr., OF), Nichole Payne( Sr., C), Amanda Hutcheson( So., C/IF), Mandi Burns( So., P/OF, 1.50 ERA in 37 IP, 10 RBIs) <p> Newcomers to watch : Ally Winham( Jr., SS/2B), Amber Russell( Jr., OF), Hannah McKay( Jr., OF), Shannon Bear( So. 2B/SS/OF), Blake Wilson( So., OF), Lauren Mathis( So., 1B/DH) <p> Outlook : The biggest question is whether Mandi Burns can replace Brittany Minton, who set every pitching record at Grayson before leaving for Chipola College in Marianna, Fla. Burns got off to a great start by throwing two complete-game wins without allowing an earned run. " She 's talented, but she 's just a sophomore, " Pirkle said. " She 's just going to have to get game experience. " The Rams are an excellent defensive team that will contend for a playoff spot. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) <p> 2004 record : 1-15 <p> Returning starters : 3 <p> Key players : Chandra Shpak( Jr., P/SS), Kasey Murray( Jr., IF), Helen Bisrat( Sr., 3B/P), Brittany McCain( So., C) <p> Outlook : May inherits the toughest situation in the county. Several players have transferred, and the Mustangs again will be very inexperienced. <p> PARKVIEW PANTHERS <p> Coach : Steve Westmoreland( first year) <p> 2004 record : 12-22 <p> Returning starters : 5 <p> Key players : Kim Stercay( Jr., SS,.297, 15 RBIs), Katie Kenady( Sr., 2B, 11 RBIs), Kelly Croxton( So., P), Regina Purvis( Sr., OF), Courtney Folsom( So., 3B), Katie Roling( Sr., 1B), Anna McCray( Jr., 1B/3B) <p> Outlook : Westmoreland, who led Elbert County to a Class AAA third-place finish in 2003, takes over a team coming off a down year. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best players, who started as a freshman on the Panthers ' squad that finished fourth in the state. Defense will be a team strength, offense a question mark. <p> SHILOH GENERALS <p> Coach : Kristy Dermid( first year) <p> 2004 record : 8-15 <p> Returning starters : 8 <p> Key players : Megan Wiggins( Jr., SS,.380, 9 RBIs), Natalie Jones( Jr., P), Danielle Tippins( Jr., P) <p> Newcomer to watch : Amber Piatt( Sr., C, missed last season) <p> Outlook : This could be the region 's surprise team. They 've got a rising star in Wiggins and a savvy new coach in Dermid, who took over after leading Shiloh 's successful volleyball program. And there 's an experienced core that 's tired of losing. If Wiggins gets some offensive help, the Generals will contend for a playoff spot. <p> SOUTH GWINNETT COMETS <p> Coach : Ryan Queen( second year) <p> 2004 record : 21-17-1, reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jenny Side( Sr., C,.433, 2 HRs, 19 RBIs,.619 SLG), Samantha Russo( Sr., 1B,.324, 27 RBI), Sasha Philpot( Sr., P, 1.96 ERA, 88 Ks) <p> Newcomers to watch : Aimee Koehlke( So., 2B), Erin Jones( Jr., RF, injured last season) <p> Outlook : Side and Russo comprise a fearsome middle of the order, but the Comets have only four seniors and must find replacements for standout outfielders and table-setters Myesha Finney and Tori Fobb. Queen will rely heavily on Philpot, an ace in the making. " With Sasha coming back as a senior and our No. 1 pitcher, I think we 'll compete and make a run in state, " he said. <p> Region 7-AAAAA <p> 2004 Gwinnett playoff teams : Collins Hill, North Gwinnett, Mill Creek <p> COLLINS HILL EAGLES <p> Coach : Amy Cook( third year) <p> 2004 record : 23-12, region champs, reached North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Peters( Sr., SS,.393, 18 RBIs), Jessica Martin( Sr., OF,.374), Libby Munson( Jr., P), Kara Pollock( Jr., 1B/P/OF), Rebecca Roles( Jr., 2B), Tamara Perkins( Sr., 3B), Shelley Jenkins( Sr., C) <p> Newcomers to watch : Amber Baylor( Sr., OF), Kelly Edmondson( So., OF), Lindsay Ellenburg( So., UTL), Michelle Broderick( Sr., OF/P), Angela Clay( Jr., 2B/C), Katie Fidler( Jr., OF), Carmen Fowler( Jr., SS/2B), Kaleigh Dyer( Sr., OF) <p> Outlook : The Eagles are loaded -- again. After finishing third in the state two years ago, Collins Hill was eliminated in sectionals last season. Now the Eagles, who have no obvious weaknesses, are primed for a return trip to Columbus. But first they 'll have to get by North Gwinnett to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy Keefer( 10th year) <p> 2004 record : 21-7 <p> Returning starters : 4 <p> Key players : Adele Voigt( Sr., OF,.333, 11 runs), Chelsea Garrett( Jr., SS,.288, 17 runs), Shelby Robinson( Jr., 2B, 9 RBIs) <p> Newcomers to watch : Alanna Hadley( Jr., P, transfer from Central Gwinnett), Sarah Bentley( Fr., P) <p> Outlook : After barely missing sectionals last year, the Falcons have a good chance to make it this season. Hadley 's arrival bolsters not only the pitching staff but the offense -- she drove in 19 runs last year at Central Gwinnett. But Dacula will miss outfielder Brittany Rogers, now at Alabama. With just four returning starters, Keefer said Dacula has " a good group of young talent that can get the job done. " <p> DULUTH WILDCATS <p> Coach : Dawn Marsh( 10th year) <p> 2004 record : 16-15 <p> Returning starters : 4 <p> Key players : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Sr., 2B), Emily Chavis( Jr., SS), Olivia McGehee( So., C), Kristin Colburn( So., 1B/OF) <p> Newcomers to watch : Kristin Perez( So., 1B/2B/OF), Paula Manowski( Fr., P), Courtney Conley( Fr., P), Stephanie Ottimo( Fr., P) <p> Outlook : Marsh is counting on a lot of freshmen to contribute immediately. " With a very young team, we are going to build team unity and depend on all the upperclassmen to lead by example, " she said. " We 'll try to improve every day so we can be competitive when the region tournament gets here. " <p> MILL CREEK HAWKS <p> Coach : Kelly Murdock( second year) <p> 2004 record : 14-15-2, reached North sectionals <p> Returning starters : 6 <p> Key players : Bethany Ullrich( Jr., P/OF), Erica Moore( Jr., SS), Maggie Davis( Jr., IF), Katy Hackett( Jr., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Brittany Singer( So., OF), A.D. Samaniego( Sr., OF) <p> Newcomer to watch : Brittany Owen( Jr., IF) <p> Outlook : After Mill Creek 's surprisingly successful first season, pitchers Bethany Ullrich and Katy Hackett are looking to lead the Hawks back to the sectionals. Role player Samaniego has become a leader because her team-first attitude rubs off on the younger players. If the Hawks maintain that mind-set, Murdock believes they can advance further than last year. " Our strengths are the kids ' hard work and dedication, " she said. " This group is setting high expectations for work ethic and sacrifice, and it pays off. " <p> NORCROSS BLUE DEVILS <p> Coach : Michelle Bowden( first year) <p> 2004 record : 13-10 <p> Returning starters : 4 <p> Key players : Tiffany Jones( Jr., C), Nina Iduate( Sr., SS), Sadie Lingsch( Sr., P), Allison Klibanoff( Jr., OF/2B) <p> Newcomers to watch : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Sr., 2B/1B) <p> Outlook : Bowden, returning to Gwinnett County after coaching Chattahoochee 's girls basketball team last year, takes over a team that could compete for a playoff spot. " We have a team that has not played a lot together, but we have some key returning players who have shown a tremendous amount of leadership, " she said. " I feel like our hustle will help overcome some of our inexperience. " <p> NORTH GWINNETT BULLDOGS <p> Coach : Mike Cavey( second year) <p> 2004 record : 27-13, reached North sectionals <p> Returning starters : 7 <p> Key players : Jessica Batten( Sr., P, 17-8, 0.86 ERA), Christie Thompson( Sr., 2B,.316), Brianna Hesson( Jr., 1B, 24 RBIs, 10 doubles), Stacey Condra( Sr., P/OF, 0.72 ERA, 14 RBIs) <p> Outlook : An extra-inning loss kept the Bulldogs from the final eight in Columbus last year. With seven returning starters led by ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for region supremacy and make a run at the state title. " We got a good taste of what it was like to be one inning away from going to Columbus, " he said. " We feel we have a great shot this year for a state championship. " <p> PEACHTREE RIDGE LIONS <p> Coach : Duane Wilson( first year) <p> 2004 record : 14-14 <p> Returning starters : 8 <p> Key players : Natasha Willemse( Sr., C), Jackie Samuels( Jr., P), Jackie Gonzalez( Jr., OF), Megan Gourdeau( Jr., SS), Allysa Hinger( Sr, OF), Jenna Bearden( Jr., OF/1B), Kayla Miller( Jr., 2B), Kim Miller( Jr., OF), Rhea Taylor( Jr., OF) <p> Outlook : The Lions return eight starters from a team that lost a mind-boggling 12 one-run games last year. They 're determined to make sectionals and, behind the nearly unhittable Samuels, they could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be solid, " Wilson said. " We are hoping to improve our hitting, bunting and our ability to move runners.

Brooks and Shannon Wilson key the offense, the defense is outstanding and Groves continues to get better on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Judy Tenney( 21st year) <p> 2004 record : 29-5, region champs, third in state <p> Returning starters : 8 <p> Key players : Jessica Coan( So., P, 29-5, 0.33 ERA, 18 shutouts, 407 Ks,.339 BA, 2 HRs, 23 RBIs), Stacy Elrod( Sr., SS, 17 RBIs), Rebekah Osteen( Sr., LF), Julio Stephens( Jr., OF/1B), Kinsey Davis( Jr., OF/2B), Janey Elrod( Jr., 3B), Mollie Mitchell( So., C, 17 RBIs), Reagan Page( So., 2B/OF) <p> Newcomers to watch : Austin Macenzak( So., IF/OF), Kensi Weir( Fr., CF/3B), Madeline Baker( OF/1B) <p> Outlook : Despite losing some top hitters, the Spartans seem a good bet to return to Columbus behind the overpowering Coan. Tenney said her team is intent on outdoing last year 's, which finished third in Class AA. Whether the Spartans fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors together had 17 extra base hits, " Tenney said. " We 're going to have to find a way to manufacture runs.

But Strong is n't judging them on wins and losses. " One of my goals is to enjoy the season this year, win or lose just enjoy the competition and enjoy coaching these girls, " he said. " So far, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me everything they can so far.
