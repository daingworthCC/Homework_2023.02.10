3068441 <p> What John Gray did for marrieds and others in committed relationships, he now wants to do for singles. <p> Gray, a onetime monk and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi devotee turned marriage counselor who now commands a multimillion-dollar relationship industry, is a matchmaker for the ' 90s and beyond. His goal is to help men and women bridge what he sees as an astronomical-sized gulf between the sexes. <p> His new book, " Mars and Venus on a Date "( $ 25, HarperCollins), is chock-full of the finer points of dating etiquette - like a detailed explanation( in case you missed it during high school) of " getting on first base, " and even " sliding into home base. " <p> He advises women that it 's not a good idea at the outset of a date to reach over and unlock a man 's car door after he 's just gotten her tucked into her seat, because this is " overgiving " and " compromises her position. " <p> And there 's a whole chapter on that nemesis of many a burgeoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you " but does n't ; causing the woman to call him and start ragging him about what 's wrong.( Ladies, do n't do this. It 's what Gray calls " calling for a weather report every day. " It indicates desperation, even if you think it 's just good manners. And besides, " A man does n't instinctively understand Venusian manners. In many cases, as we will continue to see, he is clueless, " writes Gray.) <p> The new book follows five other Mars/Venus tomes and two relationship books written before Gray came up with the planetary metaphor to explain the communication chasm between the sexes. <p> The catchy-titled books spawned infomercials, audio and videotapes, a CD-ROM, weekend workshops, Mars and Venus vacations, and an institute that franchises seminars in cities around the country, including Denver. <p> There 's also a one-man, Broadway-style show that 's part education, part entertainment and, say critics, a lot of parts of John Gray 's ego. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buell Theatre( tickets are $ 20-$ 45, plus handling fees ; call Ticketmaster, 830-8497). <p> For those who just ca n't get enough of the Gray philosophy, there 's also a Saturday workshop at the Westin Hotel - not starring Gray, but led by " specially-trained Mars/Venus facilitators. "( Cost is $ 69 plus fees, unless you buy a joint ticket for the Friday show, $ 69-$ 94 ; either event can be attended separately.) <p> Gray says he never intended to become the guru of male-female relationships. <p> " I do n't even have a PR firm, " he said in a recent phone interview. " It( the Mars/Venus concept) just sells itself. " <p> Gray 's shtick, boiled down, is that men and women are so different when they try to hook up, it 's as if they were raised on different planets. <p> " Not only do men and women communicate differently, but they think, feel, perceive, react, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes in his first book, " Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus " - the best-selling nonfiction hardback ever, at 6 million copies so far. <p> And when each sex expects the other to feel the same way they do, conflict ensues. <p> He writes of what " life on Mars " is like( " Martians value power, competency, efficiency and achievement ") while noting that " Venusians have different values. They value love, communication, beauty and relationships. " <p> It 's nothing too profound ; these seem like the same " truths " that come from a raft of other relationship books, with a little celestial geography thrown in. The Mars/ Venus books go on to explain how men typically act in a situation, then how women respond, or vice versa, and how this sets up a misunderstanding. <p> He goes on to offer tips on how both sides can change those patterns, or, in some cases, just realize that this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Gray bristles a bit when it 's suggested that this is pretty basic, common-sense stuff. <p> Then again, perhaps people did n't know it, or they would n't be snatching up the Mars/Venus library at such a clip. <p> In fact, some of what he 's saying is knowledge we already have, said Gray, like the ability to know when we 're with a person who seems " right " or is a potential " soul mate. " What people do n't know, and where the problems come in, is how to properly move through stages of a relationship, so they can come out on the other end with a successful marriage, he says. <p> Gray 's new book says those stages are attraction, uncertainty, exclusivity, intimacy and engagement. Skip any one, and you 've got a recipe for a busted relationship - either before or after you make it to the altar, he says. <p> He 's not claiming that if we could all just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce - just less of it. <p> " People do get divorced, even though they might be with the right person, " he said. He 's had clients near divorce who come for counseling or a workshop and go back to Stage One - attraction - and start all over, successfully. <p> He 's also had clients near divorce who took the workshop and still split. But their breakups were " smoother, " Gray contends. <p> " I firmly believe that if people were better educated( about relationships), if they took classes on dating and pre-marriage training, divorce would strongly decrease, " he said. <p> " But would there still be divorce? Sure. It 's like skiing lessons : If you take a class, you 're probably less likely to break a leg. And even if you do learn first, you might still fall and break a leg. But if there were no instruction at all, there would be lots more broken legs. " <p> Gray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so appealing to the masses. His books are full of what some might call platitudes, but which he just considers good advice, like this gem, from the chapter about Stage Two, when both sides are feeling uncertain : <p> " If he pulls away, she should gracefully allow him to take his distance. A woman needs to remember that men are like rubber bands. They pull away. If you do n't run after them, they will spring back. " <p> If men are springy, well, " women are like waves, " he writes. <p> " As a woman becomes more vulnerable in the relationship, then quite naturally her feelings tend to rise and fall. For many weeks she may feel loving and happy, but then suddenly, after the wave reaches its peak, the wave crashes and she hits bottom. When the wave crashes, a woman needs a man 's love the most. " <p> Does all this help people navigate the rough relationship waters any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly modest on that topic. <p> " It does work better, and that 's why it 's still No. 1( on best-seller lists). It helps people find what they 're looking for : greater intimacy, better communication and more romance, " he said. <p> Ask how his technique differs from others - like Dr. Laura Schlessinger 's books on the stupid things women do and the mistakes men make, or last year 's touted " The Rules, " which advocated women waiting for men to pursue them - and Gray is n't shy. <p> " Dr. Laura helps people understand values there are many pieces of the puzzle, and some people need that. I teach the piece of the pie that teaches romance and communication, " he said. " ' The Rules ' apply to single women who are desperate and they can help many women, for one thing because it teaches aggressive women not be so aggressive. " <p> Gray also occasionally sounds this theme, advising women to pull back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things like unlocking car doors - because pleasing women is what makes men happy. <p> It is precisely because of his own marital downfall that Gray can be so empathetic, he says. He was a monk in his 20s( Time magazine recently explained those years as Gray being " personal assistant " to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the late ' 60s guru to the Beatles and other celebrities), then went on a sexual binge in which he admittedly bedded numerous women. <p> His first wife, Barbara DeAngelis, herself now turns out books like " How to Make Love All the Time. " The two gave relationship workshops together. <p> As Gray tells it on the phone, the marriage broke up because he wanted children. As Time magazine 's profile has it, she left him for another man. <p> Either way, he was " shocked, " but he eventually started seeing Bonnie, a woman he 'd dated during the binge days. They married and have been together 12 years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to terms with his own marital breakup, Gray read a lot and went to workshops. Then he decided to cull it into his own unique Mars/Venus approach which, in hindsight, was a sign of marketing genius. <p> " My gift is to take all this information that 's out there and put it into common terms that people can understand, " he said. " That 's my expertise. " <p> For information on workshops other than this weekend 's, call 604-2222. PLACES TO MEET A SOUL MATE <p> Call up a friend 's date if and when they stop seeing each other. Be certain your friend is no longer seeing the person. <p> At a party, continue to move around ; a prospective date has an easier time approaching you. Avoid getting stuck on the couch. <p> Go to places where you are not very competent and need the assistance of others <p> If you 're not a morning person, get up earlier and go for a walk or jog and meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses in a sexy manner and attracts the attention of many men, she should try dressing in a less provocative manner and attract the attention of more discerning guys who are also interested in getting to know her. <p> Babysit for friends and stroll with their children through the park, or borrow a friend 's dog for a walk. Women are particularly attracted to a man who can care for a child or a pet. <p> On an airplane, hang out near the rest rooms and strike up a conversation while waiting in line. Be sure to walk up and down the aisles to be seen and to see if your soul mate is there. - From " Mars and Venus on a Date. "
