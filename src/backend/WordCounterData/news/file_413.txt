3069841 <p> Limbaugh made choice <p> Re : ' Limbaugh should pay full price, ' Oct. 19 Ken Hamblin column. <p> Hear! Hear! Ken Hamblin got it right : ' Rush Limbaugh is a junkie. ' It seems Limbaugh would have us believe he could n't help it because his pain pills were prescribed. It 's highly unlikely that he was getting a sufficient supply just from a medical professional who wrote a prescription ; there were other sources. <p> Those of us in the field of treating chronic-pain patients know that long-acting narcotics, when taken as prescribed, are not only quite effective in helping individuals manage their pain, but do not produce some type of emotional/mental ' high. ' By choosing to use the phrase ' prescription pain medication, ' Limbaugh seems to be attempting to reduce his responsibility and culpability. It is extremely rare that an individual with chronic pain who follows a plan of using a long-acting narcotic gets addicted. Limbaugh 's drug habit was a behavioral choice that he made, over and over. <p> JOSEPH C. ROOK <p> Denver <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters are key to democracy <p> Some of us will soon be voting for officials to represent us in government. Constitutions and statutes require that anyone can be elected to office, with certain very limited restrictions, mostly dealing with age. There are no restrictions as to mental capacity, learning or experience. Yet, elected individuals have to deal with a gamut of complicated financial, legal, judicial, administrative, economic, personnel, social and other issues. As we have seen, from the experience of some school districts, relying on the ' expertise ' of appointed administrators is not a substitute for knowledgeable oversight by elected officials. <p> The American Civl Liberties Union and strict constitutionalists will argue that the guaranteed rights to hold elective office overrule any negative impacts that may result from a lack of expertise. With no judgment on the school board intended, elsewhere, this has contributed to, in worst-case scenarios, the election of incompetent, undedicated individuals or ones not working in the public interest. <p> It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some knowledge of the aspects of the governmental functions they are elected to oversee. Unfortunately, in some cases, legislators vote on bills based merely on their party affiliation rather than the merits of the proposed legislation. <p> The problem does not only lie with the qualifications of the candidates, but also with the voters. Many make their selection based on political party, ethnic origin, word of mouth, name recognition or other motives rather than qualifications of the candidates. <p> Add to this the fact that the current popularity of term-limit restrictions forces out of office those who have, hopefully, gained some learning experience while in office. <p> In this ' off year, ' only candidates for local government will be on the ballot, some unopposed. However, the few of us who do vote may be voting for candidates with little more chance that our selections are the best candidates than winning at a Black Hawk casino. <p> Does this lack of knowledge by both the candidates and the voters serendipitously lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not to suggest that other forms of government are superior in their effects. However, we must seek the reasons for the success of this country elsewhere, and more in spite of some of our elected officials than because of them. Although all the ramifications ca n't be considered here, it might suggest that, just as when seeking employment in the private sector, qualifications are essential, in the public sector the same might be beneficial. <p> JOHN FOLSOM <p> Longmont <p> What about victims? <p> Re : ' CEO finds ideal boss in Buffett, ' Oct. 19 Al Lewis column. <p> I 'm ecstatic to learn that Johns Manville is doing so well under Warren Buffet and Jerry Henry. Revenues were up over a half-billion dollars in just seven years. Al Lewis ' column does n't say what the profits were, but considering that Buffett told Henry, ' We can afford to lose a lot of money, ' one would have to assume they were substantial. Ironically, since 1982 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigation was threatening to liquidate the company. They simply put a pittance in a trust for the victims, and once that was gone, they were under no further obligation. <p> By their own admittance, they now have one of the cleanest balance sheets in the state. How very nice for them. Not so nice is that they left scattered in their wake victims like my brother, who contracted mesothelioma while working there. His ashes are now spread in the mountains of Colorado. Companies like Johns Mansville, Haliburton and Owens Corning knowingly exposed thousands of people to cancer-causing asbestos. These same companies have convinced the courts to go easy on them and are now working on a plan that would have the federal government further shield them from their liabilities. The whole scenario makes me sick. <p> JACK WERNET <p> Grand Junction <p> How much abuse? <p> Re : ' Sex charges shadow girl 's coach ; Hoopsters ' Lopez denies ex-players ' allegations of improper contact, ' Oct. 12 news story. <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Colorado Hoopsters and has measured its own success on how well it competed against them in the past. On those rare occasions when they were able to beat the Hoopsters, it gave our girls a sense of pride and joy and feelings of accomplishment. <p> Based on The Post 's story, it also now gives me feelings of regret. How much abuse - emotional and possibly physical - did Lopez inflict on the Hoopster girls as a result of those losses? <p> The article raises a far more important question : Who is the more abusive party - the coach who lives vicariously through his teams or the parents who allowed, and continue to allow, their children to be emotionally and possibly physically and/or sexually abused in their pursuit of a scholarship? <p> JAMES P. DOHERTY <p> Denver <p> Fortune on unfortunate <p> Re : ' Billionaire a soccer mom ; Low-key Ft.

How ironic that one of the most common reasons for bankruptcy in the U.S. today is health care, and yet we have made medical-equipment company heiresses rich and enabled them to become heroes for their ' cultural contributions to society. ' I suggest she got rich on the backs of millions of Americans, since each one us pays for the rising cost of health care. <p> Just when will the average American demand basic, universal health care instead of these kinds of ' success stories '? <p> STACY MANGOLD <p> Centennial <p> ' Yes ' on Boulder 's 2C <p> Re : " No ' on Boulder 2C, ' Oct. 14 editorial. <p> Boulder Ballot Question 2C is not about needing an urgent change. It is about having a system of government that gives a more effective voice to all its citizens, holds representatives accountable and diminishes the power of special interests. <p> The current system has allowed the Crossroads Mall debacle, wasteful debates on national problems, and comical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven by special interests, not by most citizens ' desires or concerns. <p> This happens because accountability is greatly diminished when individual council members can hide among their eight colleagues, dispersing the vote and spreading the blame. <p> Like every other system of government, 2C is neither perfect nor a panacea, but it goes a long ways towards curing the systemic flaws that have resulted in astonishingly poor decisions. <p> MATTHEW K. HOBBS <p> Boulder <p> Water key in Boulder <p> In the coming council elections, Boulder voters need to evaluate candidates ' understanding of water issues. Last year 's drought was a wake-up call. The dead trees and other plantings in Boulder are a consequence of our inadequate water allocation strategy. We need to adopt a water budget instead of the current increasing block rate structure. <p> The city is currently conducting a rate study to investigate alternative water rate structures, including water budgets. This study was proposed by me and several other members of the Water Resources Advisory Board. We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a council that can understand the issues and make the right decisions. <p> Water is a vital resource for Boulder and for the entire arid West. We need leadership that understands water use and water conservation. I know that Mark Ruzzin is one candidate who advocates sensible water policies. He has a good environmental record and has supported water budgets. Voters need to ask the other candidates where they stand on this important issue. <p> JIM KNOPF <p> Boulder <p> The writer is a member of Boulder 's Water Resources Advisory Board. <p> Vickrey for Aurora <p> Re : ' Vickrey reveals bankruptcy ; Aurora mayoral candidate ties Feb. filing to husband 's health woes, ' Oct. 14 news story. <p> I want to express my continuing support of Debra Vickrey for the position of mayor of Aurora. <p> Vickrey 's having to file for bankruptcy in no way reflects on the job she would do as mayor. The decision to file for bankruptcy is not something a person does without a lot of thought. When that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay with your credit history for 10 years. <p> This issue has now been brought forward and explained. It therefore has no further need to be discussed in any future political forums. Debra has my vote, and her husband has my wishes for a full recovery to good health. <p> NANCY DELONG <p> Aurora <p> Pierce for council <p> Among the field of seven at-large candidates for the Aurora City Council, one of them is way above the others in his commitment to and knowledge about Aurora. That candidate is Brad Pierce. Brad has served on numerous city committees and task forces, has been president of his neighborhood organization and therefore truly understands the issues that need to be addressed at the council level. Brad works quietly but persistently. When confronted by a divisive issue, he brings all sides to the table and guides them to a solution. His problem- solving skills have made my life as a City Council member much easier, since he worked the issues in his neighborhood and got them resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valuable addition to our City Council. <p> INGRID LINDEMANN <p> Aurora <p> The writer is a member of the Aurora City Council. <p> Vote ' no ' on 32 <p> As an elected county treasurer in Colorado, I hope that homeowners will vote a strong ' no ' on Amendment 32 in this election. <p> Amendment 32 is bad for homeowners. It is designed by big business to overturn the Gallagher Amendment, which has protected Coloradans for more than 20 years. This will shift the business share of property taxes to homeowners. <p> It is bad for schools, law enforcement and other local government. It will permit big-business owners to exempt their own personal property taxes through legislation they have pushed for several years. This will reduce total property tax revenue by up to 15 percent without reducing homeowners ' property taxes by a penny. <p> It is bad for Colorado politics. The largest contributors to passing Amendment 32 are out-of-state tobacco companies. We do n't need whatever they have been promised in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence our elections or our legislature. <p> The best thing voters can do for Colorado this November is vote ' no ' on Amendment 32 and return their mail ballots early and with extra postage so they will be received before Election Day. <p> ROBERT HULLINGHORST <p> Boulder County Treasurer <p> Ref. A is a no-brainer <p> Re : ' Should we OK revenue bonds for water projects? ' Oct. 19 Perspective cover articles by Gov. Bill Owens and Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar. <p> Voters should n't have to think twice before approving Referendum A. The severe drought of the last several years should be enough incentive to take Gov. Owens ' plea to save Colorado 's water. <p> Attorney General Ken Salazar 's third point in his opposition to the referendum is a suggestion to conserve water. I do n't think Salazar took a good look at the reservoirs last year when the water marks had dropped to historic lows. Last year, residents across the state did conserve the little water that was left in our reservoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. First and foremost, we have to build the necessary facilities to hold water. <p> PAUL E. PRICE <p> Denver <p> First, conserve water <p> Gov. Owens and other supporters of Referendum A want new waterworks to ensure economic prosperity for future generations. If I read the governor 's argument correctly, Colorado currently has sufficient water storage facilities, and any new ones would simply guarantee that Colorado 's entitled share does not leave the state. Greed aside, this argument fails to address the central historic problem with regard to scarce resources in the West : Public investment in resource management encourages speculation, which in turn promotes explosive growth. Colorado 's problem is not that it lacks an adequate supply of water ; it is that it has always based its economy on the exploitation of its resources. Additional water storage will not solve this problem. It will only continue it. <p> I agree with Attorney General Ken Salazar that conservation measures will do more to solve Colorado 's ' water problem ' than will Referendum A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection for basin-of-origin under Referendum A. Let 's hope our attorney general is never called upon to litigate a basin-of-origin dispute, since he believes the Rio Grande and Arkansas Rivers to be tributaries of the Colorado. <p> DON LOVE <p> Windsor <p> Einstein or Owens? <p> Albert Einstein, the greatest mind of the last century said, ' The problems of today are so enormous, they can not be solved by the level of thinking that created them. ' <p> Therefore, you have to question Gov. Owens ' support of Referendum A that would build more dams in Colorado but not solve the problem. If we build more dams, the developers will build more homes and more people will flood into Colorado. It would only delay the inevitable crisis and create an even greater crisis for future generations. By building more dams, Owens and his cronies will add several million more people to Colorado - and, given time, we 'll have even greater catastrophic consequences as those people overwhelm our mountains and our rain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be a minor inconvenience of not being able to water your lawn. It will be a major disaster with deadly results for all of us. <p> Hence, would you put your trust in Owens and developers whose only god is money and power - with a total lack of common sense or concern for our children and future generations? Or, would you put your trust in Albert Einstein or anyone with common sense? The only logical, reasonable, rational, realistic and responsible vote for more dams in Colorado which will give us millions of added people is to vote ' no ' on Referendum A. <p> FROSTY WOOLDRIDGE <p> Louisville <p> ' No ' on Douglas 1B <p> Douglas County citizens, did you know that your commissioners placed a question on the ballot that, if passed, will allow them( along with other elected officials) to extend their time in office from two consecutive terms to three consecutive terms? Also, did you know that a single petition signed by about 1 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on the ballot? <p> How much prior information about Ballot Question 1B did you receive before getting your ballot in the mail? Our elected officials must encourage voters to learn about the good, bad and ugly of all countywide ballot issues. A large information gap about Ballot Question 1B now exists, because there were no extensive public debates and/or published information by county officials about why changing the current law on term limits is needed for Douglas County. <p> Lack of accountability by our commissioners on this important issue prompts me to recommend all Douglas County citizens vote ' no ' on Ballot Question 1B. <p> JERALD S. FIFIELD <p> Parker <p> -- Upset about symbol, not its publication <p> Re : ' Students stir Pledge debate with controversial image, ' Oct. 19 news story. <p> I was astounded to read your article, which inaccurately reported that I was upset about the lack of sensitivity in Grand Junction High School 's Orange and Black newspaper printing the Pledge photo. I was upset that the Nazi ' Seig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were not for the Orange and Black publishing the photograph and accompanying article, the Nazi salute would still be displayed, as it had been since the beginning of the year.

And, third, hanai is a very serious and controversial practice, used by Hawai'ians for thousands of years, of giving away one 's children to relatives or friends with no legalities involved. It is offensive that the term has been used in such a cavalier manner to perpetuate a continued and blatant cultural misunderstanding of the Hawai'ian people. <p> Whether The Post is aware or not, there is currently a serious and heartfelt struggle within the Hawai'ian islands for sovereignty and recognition of kanaka ma'oli, or people of Hawai'ian blood. For years we Hawai'ians have stood by and watched our lands and racial representation be taken over by outsiders - it is still very difficult to convince mainlanders that native Hawai'ians are tall and slender with frizzy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the media has faithfully and inaccurately represented us as Asian. <p> MANULANI APAU <p> Littleton -- Left speechless <p> Re : ' Can you spell ' insult '? Cop transcripts do, ' Oct. 19 Jim Spencer column. <p> Thanks to Jim Spencer for informing us of the Denver Police Department 's incredibly demeaning and divisive practice of typing phonetic representations of the mispronunciations made by interviewees. This practice serves to devalue the speaker 's testimony and concerns. <p> I am a white professional.

Then I turn the page and I 'm supposed to feel warm and fuzzy about the Sistah Pride Conference( ' Empowering ' sistahs ' ; Conference aims to build up self-esteem of African-American girls '). Were n't they embarrassed to spell it wrong like that? Do n't they feel tagged as being dumb, as Rev. Gill Ford said in Spencer 's column? <p> Puh-leeze.

Why 's it that phonetically transcribed statements made to the cops are deemed racist, but the article on the following page that uses the word ' sistah ' is not? <p> As a ' sistah, ' I have seen court transcripts ; and phonetic transcription, while strange to read, is just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change what he/she thinks the person said, because doing so would compromise the integrity of said statement. IN-TEG- <p> RI-TY.

OLIVER <p> Denver <p> Jim Spencer quotes University of Denver English teacher Barbara Wilcots as saying, ' It becomes racist if you accept deviations( from standard English) from majority people, but not minorities. ' <p> If you look at the segments of transcripts from the Paul Childs case, as printed in The Denver Post, you 'll see the transcripts of Caucasian police officers transcribed with the use of non-standard English. I assume from Spencer 's column that Wilcots meant Caucasians when she said ' majority people. ' <p> Deviations from standard English seem to have been transcribed accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case.

The source of the problem is Mexico 's economy. Despite being next door to the world 's biggest economic powerhouse, it has not learned the basic lessons of how to have a successful economy. It has resources, an industrious people, probably a reasonably well-educated populace, American factories, and still it ca n't provide work with adequate wages. This failure is due to an incompetent government and the Catholic Church. It should be clearly obvious by now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed, and it should be obvious that Mexico is unlikely to change them by itself. <p> These hordes of people willing to risk their lives to come to the U.S. to work for less than minimum wage represent a real threat to the stability and security of the U.S., a threat more real and more imminent than Iraq ever was. <p> We should offer to go to Mexico and relieve it of its present government and install a new one. That would be a regime change that we can all get behind. <p> D. H. NEAL <p> Arvada -- Send in the U.N. <p> The Denver Post is missing the ' why ' in its report on the dangers illegal migrants face. <p> You need to dispatch a crew to Mexico to uncover the obvious corruption, fiscal mismanagement, racism and hatred that is forcing these poor peasants to flee Mexico at any cost. <p> The situation seems so grave that the United Nations should send troops to Mexico to help that country stabilize and create equal opportunity for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood. <p> These poor unfortunate are fleeing their native land - and we should all be told why and how to fix it. So go to Mexico - start at the source. <p> DANIEL CUNNINGHAM <p> Aurora -- Return illegals <p> Illegal immigration has become such a horrid and emotional issue in the U.S. that the time has come for a national debate on this subject. <p> Arresting the culprits - employers who hire them - is one way of destroying illegal immigration. Imposing huge fines on employers would help, as would jail time. Criminal Americans seem to only respond to the fear of authority. <p> Ordering illegal aliens out of the country would not hurt.
