Gadgets that used to do just one thing are beginning to offer full menus. <p> Now teens can check their e-mail or research Thomas Jefferson on their cellphone or PDA, translate Spanish homework with their Cybiko, and play games or listen to music while they do all the above. <p> Whether or not this is a good thing may be moot because the technology is making it, in a word, inevitable.

" The additional cost for Internet access is also an issue. " <p> Monitoring is an issue schools are just beginning to handle as portable, multipurpose devices crop up in classrooms, says Craig Barrows, headmaster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth grade. <p> " We 've had to ask kids to take the games off their PDAs or leave them at home, " he says, but he acknowledges that policy may not work for long. Sooner, rather than later, students will be toting single multipurpose **33;1888;TOOLONG. When that day comes, says Mr. Barrows, the policy will be simple : " As long as they learn to keep the distracting stuff like games under control, we 'll be OK. " <p> Teen Allison Wolf says the future will have arrived when she and her friends can go online anywhere. <p> " The Internet is what we all want to use, " she says. " When that comes on all our other devices, that 's when it will all explode.
