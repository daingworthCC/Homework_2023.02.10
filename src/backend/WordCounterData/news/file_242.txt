3045041 <p> A Waffle House on the top end and a toll booth near the bottom stand like sentries. <p> In the 54 miles in between, Ga. 400 has transformed the communities through which it passes. From Sandy Springs, through Forsyth and Dawson counties and up to Lumpkin County, the $310 million highway is a conduit for growth. <p> The Ga. 400 extension linking Buckhead to the highway north of I-285 opened as a toll road in 1993. Construction had begun on the northern part of the highway in the early 1980s. <p> Every community along the highway has gained the people and jobs hoped for when the Appalachian Regional Commission sank its economic development dollars into the highway. But mention Ga. 400 to commuters, and they 'll groan about white-knuckled drives when the road of prosperity looks more like a parking lot. <p> It is a lesson in road-driven development that could signal the future of undeveloped land along a proposed $1 billion tollway on Ga. 316 linking Gwinnett County to Athens. <p> Even at its farthest end, Ga. 400 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahlonega to turn into a day-trip destination. <p> Dawson, the next county south, has become retail heaven, with a half-million square feet of shopping at the North Georgia Premium Outlets alongside the highway. <p> In some areas of Forsyth, mansions replaced chicken houses, vestiges from when the county was known more for poultry than Porsches. <p> Ga. 400 's four exits in Alpharetta helped convert a farming town into a center for high-paying, white-collar jobs. <p> Thick traffic <p> Just one driver, looking the wrong way at the wrong second, can turn Ga. 400 into the nightmare commuters fear most. <p> Brake lights. Cars inching forward. Nowhere to go. <p> Rush hour on the highway north of I-285 is thick with cars crammed into eight lanes, four going each direction. During the morning commute, workers head south toward Atlanta and stream north into Alpharetta. <p> The north Fulton city has a daytime population of more than 100,000, about triple the number of people who live there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tollway offers four exits within the city limits, said Mayor Arthur Letchas. <p> Near the offices are large houses suitable for executives, and many telecom, tech and biotech companies have picked Alpharetta as a base. Lucent Technologies and AT &T; have offices there. Data consolidator ChoicePoint and undergarment maker Vanity Fair have headquarters in the city. It is home to State Farm Insurance 's regional office. <p> Letchas is a comparative old-timer. He arrived in 1949 when his father moved the family from Auburn to coach football at Milton, then the only high school in a town of fewer than 1,000. Today students from Alpharetta go to three high schools -- a fourth will open in the fall -- but that growth took decades. <p> " No one knew where Alpharetta was 15 years ago, " said Letchas, who served as a city councilman for 20 years before becoming mayor two years ago. " You 'd drive along 400 and you 'd never see a car all the way down to Sandy Springs. Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was. " <p> Now the city is one of the most expensive suburbs in metro Atlanta, with a median home price of $212,000. But in some ways it 's still a small town. <p> During football season, Letchas leaves the downtown City Hall on Main Street by 3 p.m. to coach high school football. For the last three years, he 's worked as offensive coordinator at Centennial, a high school that opened in 1997 to accommodate the influx of students. It has more than 2,000 students on its rolls. <p> Letchas took the coaching job soon after he retired from the Fulton County school system in 1997. He had worked there 30 years ; his last job was as executive director for facilities. <p> His decision to retire had much to do with Ga. 400, Letchas said. He wanted to avoid the 35-mile one-way drive to the school system 's office in College Park. <p> " That kind of made my decision for me, that long drive, " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do n't know that I needed that much thinking time. " <p> Growing Forsyth <p> In Forsyth County, expensive housing a few miles from Ga. 400 is big business. Lake Lanier already drew people, and after the highway was extended, people who had shopped for high-end houses in north Fulton started looking farther north. <p> Planned communities bring in new families by the hundreds. The median home price is about $185,000 -- 92 percent higher than in 1990 -- and homes can cost $1 million or more in posh golfing developments in the southern part of the county. <p> Retail space along nearby Ga. 20 has given Forsyth restaurants and shops, gas stations and a Target with a Starbucks coffee shop inside. Census figures show that since 1990 Forsyth 's population has grown by 165 percent, to 117,000. <p> While much of the growth has happened in south Forsyth, developers are starting to look at the county 's largely undeveloped northern end, where land is cheaper. <p> This month, Roswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 866 townhomes and 33,600 square feet of office and retail space. It would be near where Ga. 400 has stoplights and intersections that allow more entrances to the highway. <p> Mary Helen McGruder was born in Forsyth County 57 years ago. For decades, her only direct route to Atlanta was down two-lane Ga. 9. <p> " I was a small child, so it took forever. It was an all-day excursion, " said McGruder, past chairman of the county 's chamber of commerce. " And now, again, it takes forever. We 've come full circle. " <p> Even though Ga. 400 is Forsyth 's yellow brick road, McGruder worries that traffic could hinder further development. <p> " I think what did us the most good may now turn into something that will do us a lot of damage, " she said. " If people ca n't get in and out, they 're going to quit coming. " <p> Dawson ' destination ' <p> On weekends, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work, but to shop. The North Georgia Premium Outlets opened in Dawson County in May 1996, and the county has n't been the same since, said Linda Williams, president of the county 's chamber of commerce. <p> Before the mall, " we would be a pass-through for people headed further north into the mountains, " she said. " We would n't be a destination. " <p> Now it seems like the 140-store mall is reproducing. A Home Depot opened across from it. Ruby Tuesday 's is next door. A new strip center anchored by a Kroger is just to the north, as are two retail developments under construction. <p> The mall has created as many as 1,200 jobs, some seasonal and part time. Sales taxes collected there pay for roads, schools, police and other services for Dawson 's 17,500 residents. Last year the county collected $9.5 million in sales taxes, 13 times what it took in the year before the mall opened. <p> " Ninety percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here to shop, " Williams said. More than 5 million visitors come every year, thousands on tour buses. <p> " Most are day-trippers, " she said. " But we 've had folks call and say, ' I 'm flying into Atlanta. Tell me how to get there. ' " <p> Stores sell designer clothing, shoes, luggage and housewares. Movado watches. Le Creuset, Waterford and Wedgwood kitchenware and dishes. Geoffrey Beene, Jones New York and Tahari clothing. <p> Before she got a job at the store, Cecilia Trotter had n't heard of the women 's apparel line Escada, where a European-size 38 black wool jacket with a rose on the lapel sells for $336. A tag lists the original price as $1,800. <p> Trotter, 23, has lived in Dahlonega for five years. She moved from Dacula to attend North Georgia College &; State University, and her husband is earning a master 's degree there now. Without the mall, Trotter does n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could work at the college, but there are not many job options, " she said. <p> For Jamie Johnson, a 20-year-old nursing student who makes about $7.50 an hour at her part-time job at the Tommy Hilfiger store, work gives her a connection to the big city to the south. <p> " A lot of people from Atlanta come up here, and you get to talk to them, " said the Royston native. " I love it here. " <p> Golden Dahlonega <p> At the end of Ga. 400, tourists turn left and head to the historic gold-mining town of Dahlonega, the commercial heart of Lumpkin County. <p> Business at the Smith House, an 18-room inn and restaurant off the shop-filled town square, has been good for decades. But Ga. 400 made it better. Revenue at the restaurant, which opened in 1922, has increased by 30 percent since the highway extension opened in 1993, the owners say. <p> The eatery 's Southern dishes, served family-style, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pass around hot serving dishes, delivered in succession from the nearby kitchen. Fried chicken. Barbecued pork. Mashed potatoes. Black-eyed peas. Creamed corn. Fried okra. Broccoli casserole. Strawberry shortcake for dessert. <p> Bobby Woodard and his wife, Kim, help fill the plate of their 4-year-old daughter, Rylee, on a Saturday afternoon in February. The family traveled north from Newnan in Coweta County, along I-85 to I-285, and up the toll road. <p> " It was an easy drive, " Bobby Woodard said. " It wo n't wear you out. " <p> At a nearby table sat members of Neriah Baptist Church in East Point who caravaned 75 miles north for a weekend retreat. The group chose Dahlonega for a second time because it 's not too far, but far enough away from urban life, the Rev. Albert J. Lindsey Jr. said after eating lunch with several couples from the congregation. <p> " It 's a straight shot from where our church is, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith House with her husband and two grown children, keeps serving sweet tea as the lunch crowd thins late in the afternoon. Because of Ga. 400, the restaurant is no longer just a seasonal draw, Welch said. <p> " It 's even 12 months out of the year, " she said. " They can get here and be back in Atlanta by night. " <p> Growth keeps going <p> A few miles back east is Ga. 400 's finish line. It 's a four-way crossroads that 's nothing like the raging multilane artery where the highway starts in Buckhead. <p> Lynn Nesmith, a 20-year-old cashier at the Chevron on the northwest corner, said she expects growth to continue in Lumpkin, where population has increased 55 percent since 1990 to around 22,700 residents. <p> " We do n't want it to, " said Nesmith, who lives in Dahlonega, population 3,700. " When you live in a little town, that 's what you want. " <p> Outside, a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just beyond, a two-lane road continues north with a view of the distant Appalachian foothills. <p> A look around is a peek at the future. <p> At the corners stand Nesmith 's gas station and one other, a bank, and the ubiquitous Waffle House. They serve tourists and people beginning to settle on largely undeveloped land a little farther up. They hint that development may not stop where the road does.
