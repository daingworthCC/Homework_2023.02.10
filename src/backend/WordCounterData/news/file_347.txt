3058841 <p> It was raining so hard when we landed that we could n't deplane immediately. But even the downpour could n't dampen our spirits. <p> It was our 10th anniversary and our first real vacation away from our three kids. We were headed back to Curtain Bluff, the intimate 62-room luxe resort on the south coast of this small Caribbean Island in the middle of the Leeward Islands, 300 miles southeast of Puerto Rico. <p> Andy and I had honeymooned here in 1982 and promised ourselves that someday we would return. That was three children and what seems like a lifetime ago. I was excited but nervous, too. As we bounced along the rutted road for 45 minutes after midnight through a rain forest, I wondered if the place could possibly match our romantic memories. Unlike many couples, we 'd truly had a perfect honeymoon - basking in the sun, dancing under the stars, eating drawn-out gourmet meals amid hibiscus and bougainvillea. <p> It 's dangerous, I knew, to return to the site of such wonderful memories. We should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fretted. But we never even had considered that. We 'd always promised ourselves we 'd return to Curtain Bluff, and finally, thanks to willing grandparents, a break in our schedules, and frequent-flier plane tickets, we 'd grabbed our chance. Now we 'd see if a second honeymoon could possibly live up to the first. <p> I relaxed as soon as we drove through the stone gates. Although it was past 1 a.m., we were greeted warmly and accompanied to our room, the formalities of check-in left for the morning. Sandwiches and beers were immediately sent to our room. We sat on the terrace overlooking the beach and the sea - every room overlooks the water - listening to the crashing waves and the crickets, savoring the warmth and the quiet. Not a single child was begging for anything. <p> Curtain Bluff is everything a Caribbean resort should be - seamless service, beautiful grounds, spectacular beaches, white airy rooms, each with a private terrace. <p> Howard Hulford, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot more than 30 years ago while flying over it as a pilot for Texaco.( He had been a World War II ace.) On one side is a calm lagoon beach with clear blue water and white sand ; on the other, the rough ocean surf. The land was so named, Hulford explained, because the water breaking on the sand resembled a curtain rising and falling. It still does. <p> Hulford wanted to build a home there. But the government wanted more tourists, not private homes and refused him permission. A graduate of Cornell University 's hotel school, he was n't going to give up his piece of paradise that easily. He would open a hotel. <p> Curtain Bluff opened in 1961 with 27 rooms, and Hulford has n't looked back since - despite 1989 's Hurricane Hugo, which did almost $ 2 million damage. The resort reopened two weeks later. <p> " People want quality, and that 's why we 're here, " Hulford says, offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest in the Caribbean. He does the buying himself. Many of his staff have been with him all their adult lives ; his Swiss chef, for 27 years. <p> Hulford and his wife remain a presence on the beach and in the dining room - really a terrace overlooking beautiful gardens. They live in a spectacular house high on the bluff on the grounds. Each season, weddings are held on Hulford 's balcony, which juts out over the sea. " Can you imagine a more romantic setting? " he says happily. <p> He runs the place as if it is one large house party. In fact, so many guests have been here so many times, it feels exactly like that as people greet friends made in past years. To foster the feeling, Hulford hosts a cocktail party every week for the guests. Another lunch beach party - complete with steel band - is also a weekly event. <p> Curtain Bluff is a place to kick back, soak up some sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> There 's no need to carry money at all while you 're here, because the rates are all-inclusive( with rooms starting at $ 425 a day for two). If you want a drink, you order one. If you want to go snorkeling, you check out the equipment. If you want to work out, even the gym offers spectacular views of the ocean. You order what you like from the menu. <p> Even the extra-cost items - deep-sea fishing, scuba diving, a taxi into St. John 's to shop - are arranged without money changing hands : They simply are added to your bill. <p> Ten miles north of Curtain Bluff, the national capital - St. John 's - offers the requisite duty-free shops with prices no better than can be found in major U.S. cities, plus a few others stocked with native crafts. Everywhere, Antiguan women try to sell you necklaces and bracelets made from shells and colored stones. When I told one her prices were too high( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sly smile, " Is n't your mother worth it? " <p> Antigua is n't a particularly good place for visitors who want to explore or shop. For one thing, the poverty just outside the gates is a jarring contrast to the luxury. Hulford is all too aware of that. He started an Old Road Fund, named for the town, and raises money for civic improvements( rebuilding a church after a fire) and to send local youngsters on to secondary school and college. <p> Christopher Columbus first sighted the 108-square-mile island on his second voyage to the New World in 1493 ; in the 17th century, the British claimed it for their own, cultivating sugar and tobacco. Antigua has been fully independent since 1981, as the largest of three islands making up the nation of Antigua and Barbuda. <p> One cloudy morning, a local cab driver drove us east to Nelson 's Dockyard. It was here at English Harbour more than 300 years ago that the British Royal Navy established headquarters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boutiques in some of the restored buildings. <p> A stop at Shirley Heights offers a spectacular view of the entire harbor, crowded with yachts. Named after Gen. Shirley, the place was a primary signal station from which message flags were flown to warn the dockyard of approaching ships. <p> Other than a couple of brief forays, we were content to spend our time on the beach at Curtain Bluff, reading and swimming and snorkeling, spectacular as ever in the Caribbean. There seemed a conscious effort among all our fellow guests to leave the workaday world behind. All week no one even asked me what I did for a living. <p> We usually ate lunch in our swimsuits at the Beach CLub. And except for the Sunday-night barbecue at the beach( fantastic grilled swordfish, among other things), dinner was a more formal affair - cocktails first followed by five courses, accompanied by entertainment. The food was as good as we remembered - grilled fishes, wonderful cold soups, tempting desserts. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only disappointment. " Music from the ' 70s for people in their 80s, " my husband concluded. <p> But we really did n't mind. We luxuriated in the time alone, away from the demands of work and the kids.( Curtain Bluff really is n't a " kid 's place, " although there were a few babies and the hotel obligingly will provide sitters.) <p> We were content, actually, to do not much of anything at all. We snorkeled. We worked out. My husband fished, catching a barracuda. We read novels. We talked, pleased to learn that we still had plenty to say to each other. <p> There 's a lot to be said for a kick-back vacation like this one. The trip was as perfect as our honeymoon - even better, it seemed, because this time, we really needed a rest, as well as time to ourselves. We savored every hour of freedom. <p> Too bad it could n't have lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally syndicated Taking the Kids column that appears regularly in the Sun-Times Travel section.
