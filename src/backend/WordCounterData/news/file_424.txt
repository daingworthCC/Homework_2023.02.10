3071441 <p> Headline was in error <p> In the Aug. 31 Sunday Denver Post appeared a headline that read, ' Oldest lawyer stays in practice, ' referring to 87-year-old Joe Berenbaum of Denver. <p> Just to set the record straight, I am Julio Zamagni, attorney registration number 005395, and am 91 years old. I still practice law and give legal advice on ' Law Nine ' on Channel 9 News. <p> JULIO ZAMAGNI <p> Lakewood <p> Editor 's note : The error occurred only in the headline. The article itself said only that he ' may be the oldest practicing lawyer in Colorado.

If the citizens of this country do n't wise up and vote this administration out in 2004, we deserve the fiscal nightmare that 's being foisted upon us. <p> PENNY VISALLI <p> Elizabeth <p> Utility companies should reward consumers <p> Re : ' Denver Water targets laundry ; Common wash areas studied, ' Sept. 9 news story. <p> It 's great to see that Denver Water is planning additional water conservation programs. Resource-efficient ' Energy Star ' clothes washers use about half as much energy and water as conventional washers. If every household in the Denver metropolitan area used an Energy Star clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area, we would save more than 4 billion gallons of water each year. <p> Denver Water, like other progressive utilities, should offer rebates to encourage more households to purchase Energy Star clothes washers and dishwashers. <p> And Xcel Energy should expand its energy conservation programs, providing rebates to households that purchase energy-saving clothes washers and other energy-efficient appliances. Doing so will reduce the need for costly and controversial new power plants, as well as help save water. <p> HOWARD GELLER <p> Boulder <p> The writer is executive director of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. <p> Welfare reform has been a resounding success <p> Re : ' Welfare caseload up ; fewer comply with work rules, ' Aug. 22 business news story. <p> I read, with great interest, your article on a recently released welfare reform study by the Urban Institute. I must confess how incredulous I am that anyone can look at welfare reform since its inception in 1996 and see anything other than a resounding success. <p> The evidence is overwhelming. First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of former recipients currently engaged in work. Second, the earnings of single parents are up. Third, and not coincidentally, child poverty has dropped dramatically. Indeed, black child poverty has reached record lows. Moreover, welfare reform has proved to be relatively recession-proof. Even as unemployment began to rise in 1999, welfare caseloads dropped - not rose - from 2.5 million then to just over 2 million earlier this year. <p> The one thing in the report with which I agree is that the percentage of the welfare caseload currently engaged in meaningful activities leading to self-sufficiency is going down. That 's because due to a quirk in the 1996 law, the current work participation rate for states is effectively zero. <p> The challenge, then, is not to maintain the status quo, but to help states lift even more families out of poverty by setting a more challenging work standard and emphasizing full-time, and not just part-time, work. Given the improving economy, now would be an excellent time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington, D.C. <p> The writer is assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. <p> Why we download <p> Re : ' Music industry sues 261 over file-sharing on Net ; 20 from Colorado among the targets, ' Sept. 9 news story. <p> How many records did you have to replace when 8-tracks came out? Then cassette tapes? And then CDs - and the CD player for them? <p> Did the artists or recording companies ever care about the consumer then? Heck no. They laughed all the way to bank. So now people share music. The Recording Industry Association of America needs to back off. <p> JOEL CLINE <p> Colorado Springs <p> Print the good news <p> Re : ' Get tough on DIA gates, ' Sept. 6 editorial. <p> The Post states in its editorial that if Frontier Airlines is not given everything it demands from the city of Denver and moves some of its future growth to another city, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever city gets Frontier 's additional business. Denver would be nuts not to try to land that growth for its own airport - and for Colorado 's economy. ' <p> Where were you the past two years when thousands of much higher-paying jobs at United were lost, robbing the city and state economy of millions of dollars? As usual, you were bashing United while it was down and trying to drive it out of business so that it could be replaced by much lower-paying jobs at Frontier and other start-up airlines. And now you have the nerve to shed crocodile tears over the potential loss of future income if Frontier expands to another airport. Could you be any more biased? <p> United Airlines has some of the lowest fares in the industry today, and is leading all major airlines in on-time arrivals over the past year and a half. But most people in Denver will never know this, because you never publish good news about United. The airline will emerge from bankruptcy next spring, and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A-concourse expansion over the B-concourse small-jet terminal. <p> MARK CASTELLANI <p> Aurora <p> Do n't play both sides <p> This editorial is typical of the kind of thinking and ' logic ' at The Denver Post. <p> On the one hand, according to Post editors, Denver city officials should ' take action ' to provide Frontier access to gates at Denver International Airport in spite of their contracted agreement with United to the contrary. On the other hand, according to the illogical Post editorial board, ' Frontier Airlines is hardly blameless ' - since they have taken action. Frontier, who has a business to run, has ' ordered new jets and announced an expansion without knowing where it would put the planes and passengers. ' <p> Frontier has taken action and has many options. Gates at DIA is only one. <p> The Denver Post conveniently uses both sides of an argument to support its position. It just does n't work that way. <p> DON R. SHERWOOD <p> Boulder <p> Better bet : Southwest <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served if Mayor John Hickenlooper and his staff play hardball with both Frontier and United. <p> But if The Post sees profitability, plans to expand and competitive fares as attractive reasons to accommodate Frontier, then it would be even better to recruit Southwest Airlines. Southwest is more solidly profitable, better positioned to expand and has consistently low fares in the markets it serves. Denver is nuts not to try to land that for its own airport - and for Colorado 's economy. <p> MICHAEL DARLING <p> Centennial @p#
