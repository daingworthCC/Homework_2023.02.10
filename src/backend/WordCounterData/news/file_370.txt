3063241 <p> In a town like this, a smudge on the boot heel of a rural county road, with no traffic light, or even a village sign, where you can holler from one end to the other, it does n't take long. <p> There, choked in the embrace of sprawling vines, it rises like a tombstone, gray and spectral, the last store standing in a town that is as withered and dry as the wisps of cotton that skitter up from the fields and drift across the road like small ghosts. <p> Is this really it? It is certainly no shrine. <p> Piles of splintered wood and cracked beams, taller than a man, form a tangled nest in the middle of the floor. The roof, or what was the roof, gapes like an open wound. Sunbeams have bleached the broken boards gray as bones. <p> It is a forgotten place, neglected, shunned. And yet, as you stand alone in front, eyes closed and imagining, you feel the weight of the history of what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a 14-year-old boy visiting from Chicago who wanted a two-cent piece of bubble gum and a joke or two with some friends. <p> They say he whistled at a white woman -- the wife of Roy Bryant, the man who owned the store. <p> They say Bryant and another man, J.W. Milam, found out and, deep in the night that August of 1955, burst into the house where Till was staying, a shack on the edge of town owned by his uncle, and took him away. <p> They say that just up the street from here, those men so cruelly beat Till that his own mother would barely recognize him. <p> He would have a laceration from where the cord of a heavy fan tied around his neck had cut into his flesh ; his body would be bloated from days immersed in the same Tallahatchie River that flows a hundred yards behind the store. <p> You look in again, at the sagging boards and dangling wires, and you glimpse an old ice box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And you realize all over that this is where it all started. Nearly 50 years ago, a case that would become a symbol and a rallying cry. <p> And you can scarcely believe it, because on a late afternoon of a beautiful autumn day, all that 's left are ghosts and echoes -- and this forgotten forlorn building. <p> ' The untold story ' <p> You have come here in search of connections, to unearth the tangible. <p> It has been nearly a half century now, but Till 's murder has only tightened its hold on the imagination of Chicago, and of the people who still seek answers about what really happened. <p> Books have been written, films made. And just this weekend, a new documentary has been released that hopes to tell " The Untold Story " of the notorious lynching and acquittal of the men charged with the killing. <p> Few people ever thought just two men carried out the slaying. And filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, working with Till 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Loggins, who may shed new light on who else participated. <p> It is dramatic enough information that authorities here may yet reopen the case -- and well worth going to Ohio to find Loggins, Beauchamp says. <p> But it is here in the Delta, where it all happened, that the case still hovers like a unexorcised spirit, he admits. And it is here where, on another fine fall afternoon, it sometimes seems you can hear a whistle from an abandoned store, or a boy 's laughter echo, or screams across the river. <p> ' What were you shooting at? ' <p> And so you start in Money, a town whose name is its sharpest irony. <p> The median income here is half that of the rest of the country. And jobs, plentiful before machines began threshing the cotton, are now scarce as the people who left to work in the fast-food joints and hotels of Greenwood, a few miles down Route 3. <p> But Jack Pittman is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch of the Money gin mill. <p> In his saggy brown work pants and tall brown tractor cap, Pittman says he is 45, but he could sadly pass for much older. <p> His teeth are jagged ; his dark skin wrinkled and grizzled. He lives across the track and does odd jobs around Money for a white landowner who lives nearby. <p> Yes, he heard about Emmett Till -- " a long time ago, " he says, but he flinches a little when he 's asked to talk about it, and, no, if it 's all the same, he 'd rather not. <p> As he starts to go back to work, a pickup truck rolls to a stop about a hundred yards away. A white man gets out with a shotgun, hoists it to his shoulder and leans the barrel on the open door of his truck. He pulls off a couple of rounds, then gets back in. <p> He pulls over to where you are standing, rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick once-over. " How you doing? " you ask. " Fine. " <p> " What is this all about? " he asks. You tell him why you are here. " What were you shooting at? " you ask. " A hawk, " he answers. " He 's been killing all the wildlife. " <p> Pittman, gripping the broom, looks over his shoulder, and as he sweeps he flicks his eyes up, then back down. <p> " So how do people get along around here now, blacks and whites? " he is asked. <p> The man, who wo n't give his name, glances at Pittman, then back at his inquisitor. " Bout halfway all right, I guess, " he says. <p> ' Smart-aleck Yankee black ' <p> The man behind the counter wo n't give his name either, but he does n't mind talking. <p> He works at one of the last jobs in Money. And he remembers the Till case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heyday, he says, when it was a cotton-picking town in the heart of the cotton capital of the world. <p> Paunchy now, wearing a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap, and a faded striped shirt under a knit sweater, he looks like a favorite grandfather, the kindly sort you 'd like to fish with in the Tallahatchie out back. <p> " Let 's see, " he says. " Used to be seven stores in Money. There was a grist mill, and across the street there was a juke joint for the blacks. They had a high old time in there. But when it went from mules and wagons to tractors and mechanical harvesters, they just did n't need the help anymore. " <p> He recalls going in the fateful store once or twice. " It had wide shelves and wood floors, " he says. Truth be told, though, he does n't remember much about the case -- " Other than that smart-aleck Yankee black came down here and insulted that feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can tell, one thing led to another and the boy got his head bashed in, and they hauled him off. I worked in Greenwood, and I did n't fool with it. " <p> To him, it was a lot of to-do about nothing. <p> " We did n't have any problem with the local blacks, " he said. " It was just like two different societies. " <p> He pauses for a minute and ruminates. Outside, two large grain elevators hum as they dry out beans and corn. <p> " To me, you got two types of blacks, " he says. " There 's what I call the **29;1693;TOOLONG types. Then there 's these cotton-patch folks. They do n't have no hygiene. I 've been down to the bank and they keep a can of deodorant spray for them, white and black. " <p> But things have changed, he says. " Why, I 'll hold the door open for a black behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one hold the door open for me and my wife. " <p> As he speaks, a young black woman steps inside. She is pretty with a red scarf tied around her head. The man looks up over his glasses. <p> " Mornin, " he says brightly. " Good mornin, " she answers. <p> She is quiet as she accepts a parcel from the man, who goes back to leaning on his elbows as she walks out of the trailer office. <p> " Come back and see us when you can stay longer, " he calls after her. <p> ' That was a rough time ' <p> Around 2 o'clock on the morning of Aug. 28, 1955, the men drove to Preacher Wright 's home, where Emmett Till was staying. After they took the boy, they headed across the Tallahatchie Bridge, Bryant would later tell a writer for Look magazine. They beat him at a plantation, then drove him to a gin near Boyle where they made the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pickup. They shot him in the head and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie, tying the fan around his neck so that the body would n't float up. A few days later, Bryant and Milam were arrested. <p> The way to the courthouse winds through the vast cotton fields, past churches with names like Antioch and Little Zion, past harvesters so wide that they take up two lanes. Cotton is everywhere. On the sides of the roads, strewn across the highways. <p> The summer of ' 55 was like any other here -- hot beyond belief. Those who have experienced it call it an unholy hotness, one that smolders over the Delta like a blanket of fire. <p> In the small town of Sumner, 25 miles up the road from Money, it was the kind of heat that dominated the days of the trial of the men charged with lynching Till. <p> It is a pleasant day today, however. And the courthouse, which still stands, where the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, seems charming. A statue of a confederate soldier, standing tall on a pedestal, gleams white on the corner, as if guarding the town. <p> The clerk here does n't mind a bit if you go to the second floor and look around, so you do. And you see how cramped it must have been with its handful of short pews and jury box so close to the witness stand you could reach out and pat the shoulder of the person testifying. In the days of the trial, Teletype machines from the outside press were set up in the lobby. <p> There was no rule against smoking, so a thick pall hung in the air. <p> They were tough days for Sumner. Dozens of reporters had descended on the town, put up in the Delta Inn, a now-condemned hotel that slumps on the corner across the tracks, and at a boardinghouse that collapsed long ago. <p> " That was a rough time, " says a black woman named Carolyn, who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was at home, a little girl. I was scared to go outside. " <p> " They were whoopin ' ass, " adds Willie James, standing next to Carolyn, shifting the toothpick in his mouth. " Whoopin ' black people 's ass. " <p> Yvonne Smith, who is in her 70s, remembers her husband telling her to stay away from downtown, too. She is a white woman with white hair who runs a machine shop. " It was just the idea of do n't go running around town, " she recalls. " There was all this press here and all this to-do. <p> " It was a terrible thing, " she says. " The whole community was shocked. " <p> The people of Sumner are proud of their town and rightfully so. The houses are pretty. The downtown square, with its W &; D Drugstore, is peaceful. You try to imagine what it was like, though, and whether any other monuments to that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that they do. The offices of Breland and Whitten -- two of the men who successfully defended Bryant and Milam -- still occupy the little brick building. J.J. Breland died long ago, and Whitten 's secretary, eyeing you warily, says her boss has Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's and " would n't know the case if you told him about it. " <p> And so you leave the little town, with its little tan-brick courthouse, and confederate soldier statue, and notice that the clock on top of the building is frozen. <p> ' Let the thing go ' <p> You came in search of connections, so before you go, you find yourself in Ruleville, standing at the door of a tiny brick ranch house near the River City Restaurant. The elderly woman answers the door in a faded pink bathrobe and she asks you in, even after you tell her why you 're here. <p> The woman, named Mary Jo, was married to Bryant. She wed him long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who had been whistled at, and lived with him here, where Bryant sought refuge after his acquittal. <p> Mostly poor, mostly black, it 's the last place you 'd think a man would seek refuge if he 'd admitted lynching a black boy, as Bryant did to Look magazine, but this is where he came and where he spent his last days. It is a cluttered house and a soap opera blares from a color set on the mantel. Bryant 's sister, Doris, also lives here, but she does n't seem to remember the case, or even her brother, until her sister-in-law loudly reminds her. <p> The wife, Mary Jo, says she changed her number long ago -- too many awful phone calls. Which is a shame, she says, seeing that she did n't have a thing to do with the case. <p> As far as all that goes, she does n't have anything to say, she tells you, other than this : She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the horrible things they say he did ; and she wishes people would just " let the thing go. " <p> Her face is pained saying even this, and though she 's polite, she 'd rather you go, too. And so you leave Ruleville, heading past the place where Bryant ran a country store in his last few years, headed back to Money. <p> ' There 's a lot of resentment ' <p> Racism and poverty have been -- and remain -- the two things that plague Mississippi in general and the Delta, specifically. And they 're the two things the people here least like to talk about. It was -- and is -- a complex topic, fraught with misunderstanding and hard feelings. <p> " There 's a lot of resentment among whites down here, when things are stirred up again, " says Annette Morgan, standing in front of the store she owns, the little country grocery in Money that has all but fallen down. People always fear something else bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugs and looks at the store. She has heard all the rumors of what happened there. She even saw Mamie Till Bradley Mobley walk around the place with some historians not long ago. But for all the trouble owning the building -- the questions and the gawkers -- she says she just ca n't seem to bring herself to tear the old store down. <p> " I 'd hate to do it, " she says. " We thought about making it into a store again. Maybe an antique shop. I do n't know. " <p> As she talks, Jack Pittman stands a couple of hundred yards away, holding his shovel, sifting through some ashes, his head down. <p> It is quiet, but for an instant, in the silence, you think you hear a whistle, see a young boy, a Chicago boy not used to Southern ways, in the fading light. But it is only Pittman, and a mockingbird, and the store, though still standing, @ @ @ @ @
