4114841 U.S. regulators, retailers and manufacturers are growing increasingly concerned that a surge in the number of products being recalled is resulting in " fatigue " by the public -- increasing the chances that consumers could ignore or miss a recall of a product that could ultimately endanger their health. # Consumers last year were deluged with 2,363 recalls, or about 6.5 recalls each day, covering consumer products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, according to data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recalls announced represent a nearly 14% increase from 2,081 in 2010 and compare with about 1,460 in 2007. # Experts say the increase is the result of a combination of greater oversight by regulators, better testing procedures and the use of social media, where consumers can quickly point out and discuss problems with other people. # " We 're experiencing recall fatigue in my mind at the consumer level and also perhaps at the business level, and we all have to worry about that, " said Mike Rozembajgier, vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided advice and helped major U.S. companies, including Merck, General Electric and Wendy 's, carry out recalls. # " We have this growing concern for safety, but with there being so many recalls going on,( is the public) paying attention to them and responding to them in a manner that is necessary for the recalls to be handled effectively? " he said. # This year alone hundreds of recalls have already been announced. Pfizer recalled birth control pills after it was found there may have been an inexact number of pills that also could have been out of sequence, increasing the chance of an unintended pregnancy. IKEA asked its customers to return about 169,000 high chairs because the restraint buckle could open unexpectedly. And Dole warned the public not to eat a lettuce salad mix due to a possible health risk from salmonella. # Retailers and government regulators are increasingly struggling to reach people who may not know about a recall, or choose to ignore it despite the potential dangers. A 2009 study conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew had been recalled and 40% admitted never having looked for recalled products in their homes. # Expanding communication # Increasingly, retailers and government agencies are expanding the methods they use to communicate with the public -- from social-media technologies such as Twitter and Facebook to more traditional methods such as phone calls and postings within their stores. But the same methods that prove successful in reaching one customer could just as easily be ignored by another. # " We do n't feel that our members are getting bombarded, but certainly the general public is, and sooner or later you do n't know what to believe, " said Craig Wilson, vice president for quality assurance and food safety at warehouse giant Costco. # The 602-store warehouse chain uses data supplied from its 60 million members and notifies them within 24 hours if they 've purchased a recalled item. It then follows up with a letter. The result : Customers return about 90% of recently recalled products. # But Wilson says the national recall system " does n't work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a single, uniform network. He says the CPSC, USDA and FDA each have a different recall system with unique requirements, making it more difficult for companies like his to make sure they are complying with the rules. # The Rochester, N.Y.-based Wegmans grocery chain has a detailed recall plan that can require hundreds of people to carry out. The 81-store East Coast chain follows a recall protocol increasingly common among retailers : posting information on its Web page and within stores for customers, notifying its followers using social-media tools and, when possible, calling individuals who may have used a store card for the purchase. # " We do what we can to protect our customers, but then our customers have to protect themselves, and they ca n't do that unless they have the information, " said Jeanne Colleluori at Wegmans. Colleluori said that last year alone Wegmans participated in about 40 recalls, and the retailer was ahead of that pace in 2012 with about 16 recalls as of early May. # Businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottom line by being honest and upfront with customers and crafting a response plan, before any recall occurs, that outlines what they will do with the public, media and regulators, industry watchers say. # " Many companies are being criticized not because they are not doing the right thing but because they are taking too long, " said Sophie Ann Terrisse, chief executive of STC Associates, a brand-management firm. # She said some firms fail to estimate the work needed to conduct a recall and quickly become overwhelmed, leading to slow responses or poor customer service from representatives who do n't have the time or know how to respond properly. " Things can get out of hand very quickly, and it 's hard to recover from that " for the brand and the company 's core audience, said Terrisse. # Protecting the public # Companies involved in recalls say their primary concern is protecting the public -- but they also have a business interest. " Our concern is for our customers, but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much aware that when there is a recall if it is a Wegmans brand product our reputation is at stake, " said Wegmans Colleluori. # Some businesses have managed to take a recall and turn it into a marketing bonanza that benefits the company. # Two years ago, McDonald 's took the unusual step of paying customers a premium to return Shrek glasses to the restaurants after concerns that paint used to depict characters on the glasses contained cadmium -- a carcinogen known to cause kidney problems. " Mistakes can be made, but the way they are dealt with is by being completely open and letting the customer become part of the recall, " said Terrisse. # The government operates a website, Recalls.gov, which offers the public information on all recalls including cars, boats, food, consumer products, medicine and cosmetics. # The U.S. Agriculture Department 's Food Safety and Inspection Service improved its recall system in March by rolling out a Twitter feed that targets consumers only if their state is affected. # USDA Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, considering the number of products that are produced, items that are sold and meals consumed each day. # " I think people want to know and need to know and have a right to know if there is a problem with a particular product, " said Vilsack. " We 're going to look at ways in which we( communicate) and constantly improve how we communicate, but we 're not going to stop communicating. " # #
