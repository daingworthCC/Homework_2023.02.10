3056841 <p> PRAIRIE VIEW - Tracy Andrus hovers in front of the classroom. He is probing the reasons people commit crimes, reading criminology theories from a textbook, which he recites word for word. One definition argues that people who associate with criminals are likely to become criminals themselves. <p> He pauses. <p> " But you know, let me tell you, " he says. " When I went to prison it was n't the first time I was in trouble. When I was in high school me and some friends on the football team decided to break into a gas station. Some of the kids on the team decided not to do it. So I wonder what that says about that theory? " <p> His students nod, then hunker down into their notebooks with pens in hand, no doubt adding Andrus ' personal history to part of their notes, to the day 's lesson. This is introduction to criminal justice on a Friday morning, and many of these students say Andrus ' teaching style - part preacherman, part stern papa, part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier. <p> " He makes me wake up every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, " said Nakesha Francis, 21, a senior business major. " On the first day of class I thought it was a joke. I was like ' Is this for real? Is this guy a real teacher? Where did this guy come from? ' " <p> From the streets, that 's where. <p> Andrus tells his students about it all : his years in prison, the struggle to rebuild his reputation, the need to stay focused on the big picture. <p> The 40-year-old Andrus is a graduate student at Prairie View A &M; University. He is also a role model for students, administrators and his family, and is active in the community. He has used his classroom at A &M; to teach lessons that are not only academic, but also realistic. <p> He does not hold back. <p> " I 've never made excuses, " Andrus said. " I 've never said the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did was wrong. I was guilty. I 'm trying to get certain messages across to my students. " <p> Messages that are simple, yet complex : Get an education ; work hard at an honest job ; keep your word ; do n't get caught up in the high-rolling, instant-gratification attitude of the streets. <p> " Patience is power, " Andrus said. " I tell that to my students all the time. If something is not coming at normal speed, you ca n't do anything about it. Delayed gratification is a good thing. But not enough of our young people know that. If you want a quick buck, you can go out and sell drugs or rob a bank or whatever, but what do you really gain? " <p> He should know. <p> Andrus was living in Shreveport, La., in the 1980s when an H &R; Block course on tax preparation caught his eye. Tax season was coming, and Andrus figured helping people with their returns would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the course, passed it and set up shop in a small office in a strip mall. <p> He was soon helping people with other financial matters. Friends asked for help juggling debt, family members sought advice on buying a house, strangers wanted to know how to pay off credit cards. <p> Business soon expanded to include consumer counseling. He helped negotiate repayment plans to creditors. His face was all over : on televisions, in phone books, on billboards. Need help paying bills? Creditors harassing you at home? Call Tracy Andrus. <p> They called. <p> Business was good, and at one point he was making $ 5,000 a month. <p> A fortune, in his eyes. <p> " For me, coming from a poor family from southern Louisiana with 12 kids, I was just blown away, " Andrus said. " That was a lot of money for somebody like me. " <p> He was 23 years old then, married with two children, and it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything he wanted. <p> He took trips. He bought clothes. He purchased four luxury cars, a truck, a boat and a big house for family. <p> " I decided that I wanted to be a playboy, " Andrus said. " I felt that I needed to take trips and do things and buy things. " <p> During a trip to Florida, Andrus decided to take a cruise. He called his assistant in Louisiana and asked her to wire him $ 500. His assistant warned him that the company account was low. <p> " I had spent all that money and did n't even know it, " Andrus said. " And that was the money for everything, the business, my family, everything. And we had all those car notes and that big mortgage. I did n't know what I was gon na do. " <p> He wrote a check for $ 4,000 drawn from his empty business account and placed it in his personal account. <p> He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd replace the money as soon as fees started rolling in, hopefully before the bank discovered that the check was bad. <p> That did n't work. In fact, Andrus opened accounts at several banks in Louisiana and Texas before getting caught. It was n't long before he had written $ 40,000 in bad checks. <p> Next? Prison. <p> After being arrested in 1992, he was sentenced to six years in the Wade Correctional Center in Homer, La. After prison, he eventually found work in real estate, convincing the owner of the real estate office that he could do the job. He did this for a few years, then enrolled at a community college in Louisiana. <p> After completing an associate 's degree, he transferred to a four-year university. He eventually made it to Prairie View, where he is scheduled to receive his doctorate in juvenile justice in June. He chose Prairie View because of its graduate program in juvenile justice. <p> He has become so well-known at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students, faculty and staff members to stop for chats, handshakes and pats on the back. He can barely walk a few feet before hearing someone yell, " Hey, Mr. Andrus! " <p> " He just radiates positiveness, " said Elaine Rodney, dean of the School of Juvenile Justice and Psychology at Prairie View. " Other faculty members know the system from a theoretical point of view, but he really knows the inside and outside of the system. That 's invaluable experience that our students can learn from. " <p> Jeannie Davis, 22, a senior business major, said she took Andrus ' course as an elective. If she were n't a senior, she 'd change her major to criminal justice, the aspiring attorney added. <p> " Most professors come in and tell you the same corny jokes and use the same dull, tired voice, " Davis said. " They talk straight out of the book and do n't really add anything to it. But he teaches us things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our say and opinion on things. " <p> Andrus sees himself as a big brother to the students. He wants them to be able to come to him with problems or issues. He has invited several of his students to attend his church, and a few of them have become members. He regularly meets with students during nonoffice hours, and he is a fraternity adviser. <p> He wants to teach and study why young people commit crimes and how society handles juvenile justice. He has been married for one year to Sonya Burnett-Andrus, a teacher in Fort Bend County. He has two sons - Tracy, 19, a student at Prairie View, and Desmond, 17, a senior in high school. <p> The lessons he teaches in the classroom are the same lessons he teaches his sons, Andrus said. <p> " Thinking that life is all about money can get you into serious trouble, " Andrus said. " And even if you do get into trouble, you can experience bad things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not letting those things stop you. " <p> NOTES : Andrew Guy Jr. can be reached at Andrew.Guy@chron.com
