3044541 <p> Strom Thurmond is the latest centenarian who was honored for working until well beyond retirement age, but finding 100-year-olds who are still active and vital is not that unusual anymore. <p> George Burns was still cracking jokes and smoking cigars approaching 100 and pianist Eubie Blake gave a concert a few months before he hit the century mark. <p> Louis Goodman, who was 5 when Thurmond was born, celebrated his birthday last June by going up in a hot-air balloon. At 101, Hazel Craytor fills in as a ceramics teacher at Wesley Woods Towers. Annie Brye, 104, regularly attends church services after a teaching career that lasted until she was 93. And Dr. Leila Daughtry-Denmark, 104, was a practicing pediatrician in Alpharetta until well beyond her 100th birthday. <p> These metro Atlantans are part of the fastest-growing segment of the population -- and the generation researchers are studying intently to learn the secrets of a long and relatively healthy life. <p> Recent U.S. census figures show that the number of American centenarians doubled during the 1990s to an estimated 70,000. By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 834,000. Many of these do not fit classic stereotypes of the very old. <p> " We live in a culture that thinks the older you get, the sicker you get. But virtually all people who live to be 100 were living completely healthy lives at age 90, " says Dr. Thomas Perls, associate professor of medicine at Boston University and director of the New England Centenarian Study. <p> Interest in centenarians is growing as aging boomers look for ways to remain healthy and expand their life spans to triple digits, says Perls. So far, possible clues range from everything from good genes and staying mentally active to clean living and just plain luck. <p> " A lot is pointing to genetics, " he says. " There are longevity-enabling genes that help them age more slowly. There is also the possibility that these genes limit the activities of free radicals unpaired electrons that corrode human tissue. Free radicals are a key mechanism in aging. " <p> Other clues may be found in biochemical research being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Barzilai 's study of 200 Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians and their children shows that the subjects all have high levels of HDL, or " good cholesterol. " While the average woman has an HDL level of 55, Barzilai says, the adult children of his centenarians have levels as high as 140. <p> " The reason we 're doing this research is not to help everyone live to 100, " Barzilai says. " Our goal is to understand why centenarians remained healthy in their 70s and 80s when their friends were getting sick and dying. If someone dies between the ages of 60 and 70, the medical costs during their last three years is $24,000. When a centenarian dies, the cost for the last three years is $8,000. " <p> Helping more people avoid age-related diseases will mean lower medical costs and longer productive years in the work force for the elderly, he says. <p> In other studies, researchers have found that not only does severe caloric restriction extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced their chances of getting diabetes, cancer, cataracts, hypertension and other diseases related to aging. <p> And, statistically, you have a much better chance of reaching 100 if you 're a woman. Four out of five centenarians are women. Researchers attribute their longevity to an evolutionary drive to not only pass on their genes, but to stay healthy long enough to raise their children and grandchildren. <p> Another factor in longevity is personality features. <p> " One thing centenarians scored low on was neuroticism, " says Perls. " They did n't dwell on problems and they managed their stress well. We know that stress is an age accelerator. It 's related to heart disease and stroke and maybe Alzheimer 's. " <p> The ability to roll with the punches is one of the traits University of Georgia researchers found in the Georgia Centenarian Study conducted from 1988 to 1998. " These were people who could successfully adapt, " says Leonard Poon, director of the University of Georgia Gerontology Center. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Beyond that, they have no idea what their magic formula might be. <p> " I ca n't say that I do n't worry, " says Craytor, who worked for 52 years as a private secretary after her husband was killed when her son was 3 months old. " But I realize it does n't do any good, so I just pass it on. If I have a secret, it 's good clean living. " <p> Brye, too, says she does n't dwell on problems, even though she admits to having had a hard life. The granddaughter of slaves, she worked in the Alabama cotton fields from sunup to sundown, lived in a cabin with no plumbing or electricity and washed clothes in an iron pot with homemade lye soap. <p> " The first school I went to was a log building, " she says. " We did n't have desks like they do now. They cut down a pine tree and split it and smoothed it off to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to graduate from Alabama State College in Montgomery and begin a teaching career. After she retired from the school system, she worked for a community action program and taught adult education classes until she was 93. <p> " It is the goodness of God that has kept me here these many years, " she says. " If I have any worries, I take them to the Lord and let him fix it. And I never smoked or drank. " <p> Goodman, however, did both. " I smoked Camels for 50 years until I got emphysema, " he says. " My doctor told me if I did n't quit, he would n't see me anymore, so I did. I was 70 and it was the hardest thing I ever did. I drank, too. I had all these bad habits. " <p> A former linotype operator for the Philadelphia Ledger, Goodman moved to Atlanta in 1945 to run a variety store. He did that until he was 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything, " he says. " I was always happy-go-lucky. I did n't care when I was younger and I do n't care now. " <p> Neenah Ellis, author of " If I Live to Be 100 "( Crown, $22.95), found many of the same qualities among the centenarians she interviewed. <p> " These are passionate people who are resilient to stress and anxiety, " says the Takoma Park, Md., author. " They do n't worry about things they have no control over. They 're optimistic and they are not just sitting around talking about the past. I interviewed one professor who was still teaching at 104. I 'm glad Strom Thurmond got all this attention for making it to 100, but there are a lot of regular folks out there who are still making a contribution. " <p> Boomers who want to reach the century mark would do well to begin practicing healthier habits now instead of relying on " fountain of youth quackery, " says Perls. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote their human growth hormone hucksterism, " he says. " If people are looking for a magic potion, it already exists. Most of us have the genes to get to our 80s in good health. The problem is that instead of taking advantage of these genes, we fight them with bad health habits. Far too many people smoke and far too few people exercise. If we changed our habits, we would add 20 to 25 years of good health beyond the age of 60. " <p> Would you like to know your chances of living to 100?
