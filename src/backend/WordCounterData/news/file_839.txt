While his friend watched, she told The Washington Post, " Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. " She eventually escaped from the room when the friend, identified as Mark Judge, jumped on them and then tumbled on the floor. She said she did not tell anyone about the attack at the time.

He said in a statement that while " I did not observe the specific incident in question, but I do remember Brett frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk.

" She added that in 1982, she was a victim of a " gang rape " at which Kavanaugh was present. But she did not say he participated in it and provided no details about where the alleged rape took place. <p> Possible related allegation : Elizabeth Rasor, a former girlfriend of Judge at Catholic University, said that Judge told her about an incident in which he and other boys took turns having sex with a drunk woman.
