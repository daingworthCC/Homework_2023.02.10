4194841 <p> At a Thursday AFT conference, Weingarten argued that the charter and school choice movements are motivated by little more than segregationist racism. <p> " This privatization and disinvestment are only slightly more polite cousins of segregation, " Weingarten said. " We are in the same fight, against the same forces who are keeping the same children from getting the public education they need and deserve. " <p> In validating that claim, Weingarten drew parallels between the current school choice movement and efforts by white racists to create private but publicly funded schools to resist integration in the 1950s. <p> Bradford said her tone is intensifying because teacher unions sense receding influence. <p> " That impotence makes you act out in ways that are not smart, " Bradford told The Post. " One of the ways that is not smart is to be a white person who runs a white organization talking about segregation that you foster. " <p> " For me and other people of color who lead organizations like I lead and care about kids in The Bronx and Bed-Stuy -- it 's not helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frankly her members deserve better than this sort of inflamed rhetoric. " <p> Bradford noted that New York 's schools -- Weingarten 's former seat of power and influence as head of the UFT -- are marred by rampant segregation. <p> " Randi Weingarten is a chief architect of that system, " he said. <p> " Over the last five or six years you have people who are defenders of the status quo -- people who have given us schools that are mediocre at best and life-crushing at worst -- frustrated that their arguments do n't work anymore, " Bradford said. " One of the ways they try to grab back the spotlight is through hateful hyperbole that helps no one. Ms. Weingarten 's remarks are a master class in that. " <p> Bradford theorized that the election of Donald Trump has intensified a sense of threatened influence on the part of teachers unions. <p> " If you are a leader of one of these organizations, the first thing you have to do is rally your base -- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things, " he said. <h> see also <p> " Maybe it 's smart tactically but if you actually care about the education of kids it 's just self-interested, selfish and destructive. " <p> Weingarten 's comments also drew censure from the Center for Educational Reform who called for her resignation. <p> Weingarten has argued that Trump 's education agenda seeks to contract funding to public schools. <p> She has also hammered Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, branding her a " public school denier " bent on crippling the system. <p> " The moment we 're in is the result of an intentional, decades-long campaign to protect the economic and political power of the few against the rights of the many, " Weingarten said in her AFT speech. " It has taken the form of division -- expressing itself as racism, sexism, classism, xenophobia and homophobia. "
