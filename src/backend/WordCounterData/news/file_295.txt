3051041 <p> Cutting edge / German engineering comes to the American garden <p> Garden advice from Europe tends to come from England, where gardening is the national pastime ; France ; or Italy, where expatriate Americans dip their spades into the rocky soil of Provence or Tuscany. But garden tools are another matter : For some of the best European imports, we look to Germany, home of Gardena, one of the world 's biggest lawn and garden products companies. <p> The company 's Adjustable Grip Professional Bypass Pruner( No. 609) proved to be just the thing to cut the mustard. Now cutting mustard, which was growing wild between rows of vines, proved to be a daunting task that took two of us most of one day to harvest enough to dry for kitchen use. The pruner, which adjusts to fit the gardener 's hand size, is lightweight enough that my hands did n't get tired, while strong enough to cut through the tough half-inch mustard stems. <p> The handles of many pruners that will cut up to 7/8-inch branches open so wide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-handed tool, but by turning a dial, I could adjust the pruner to fit my grip. A couple of times when facing a huge stem, I opened the handles up full and used both hands. <p> I ca n't say any pruner is going to be comfortable after four hours of constant cutting, but I managed to cut half a pickup load of mustard without a blister, and the precision-ground, hardened steel blade was still sharp when I moved on to cutting lilac branches the next day. That 's good enough to justify the pruner 's rather hefty $24.99 suggested retail price. <p> Although the latest to be introduced to the American market, the cutting tools are n't the only Gardena products you may want to try. Along with a five-ply garden hose system that features a Quick Connect Automatic Shut Off, the company 's 2-in-1 watering system -- called the Flower Shower( $9.97) that was reviewed here last September -- really is a cut above the ordinary adjustable hose nozzles and wands, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flower Shower 's spray mode offers a gentle rain of large drops, rather than the hard, fine spray of most nozzles, that did n't knock over my sweet pea seedlings. The water can be shut off at the wand, or adjusted to a single stream -- also gentler than a regular nozzle offers -- that makes it easy to water even overhead hanging plants. <p> The wand can be used with a regular garden hose, but I have to admit the Quick Connect feature of the Original Quick Connect Garden Hose( $19.93) -- a plastic gizmo that pops connections on and off with the flick of the sleeve, thus eliminating the need to unscrew the nozzle -- is really a handy device. A caveat : The Quick Connect is plastic and, at one point in my test, the water pressure was great enough that it forced the hose out of its connection, soaking me thoroughly. <p> Gardena products are available at major home improvement store garden shops.

Not because they do n't work. The ' French Breakfast ' radish, ' Merveille des Quatre Saisons ' lettuce, ' Nantes Primo ' carrot and chervil tapes in the French Market Culinary Collection were easy to sow( all you do is lay one of the biodegradeable, seed-impregnated paper tapes in a prepared row and cover it with soil and water) and germinated well( although more slowly than plain seeds of the same variety sowed nearby). They 're growing fine. <p> The problems are cost and choice. The packages consist of two 7 1/2-foot tapes of each seed variety( 3.99 grams total of seeds in the French Market package). Until they went " on permanent sale " last week, the company was asking $20 for the equivalent of four small packs of vegetable seeds( packaged in a quart canning jar) that, even at premium nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $9.99 for the French Market and Italian Market Culinary Collections( the latter consisting of ' San Marzano ' tomato, ' Lolla Rossa ' lettuce, ' Genovese ' basil and ' Bloomsdale ' spinach), the packages are more reasonably priced, but choice is still a problem, not to mention the fact that those tomatoes should have been started indoors months ago. The canning jar is just plain silly. What is the gardener going to do, fill it with radishes? Can one quart of tomatoes? <p> A third, the Cutting Garden, consisting of ' Miss Jekyll ' nigella, ' Persian Carpet ' zinnia, ' Red Sun ' sunflower and ' Tithonia ' Mexican sunflower packaged in a glass vase, has gone down from $22 to $10.99. <p> Similarly, Smith &; Hawken 's English Cottage Garden, Herbal Knot Garden and Checkerboard Parterre kits of seeds embedded in shaped tissue paper mats have been reduced from $26 to $12.99. <p> The parterre consists of eight mats -- four each of Roman chamomile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a 4 1/2-foot square( the center square left up to you). The cottage garden -- five mats planted with Flanders and Shirley poppies, lilac godetia, cosmos, cornflowers, godetia, rose mallow, Queen Anne 's lace and love-in-a-mist -- is intended to be planted in a 9-foot square with lots of space between mats, and the herbs -- a circle of chives, squares of ' Genovese ' basil, Italian parsley, cilantro and ' Bouquet ' dill and four rectangles of hyssop -- are meant to be planted in an 8-foot square section of the garden.( I planted the chives, basil, dill and cilantro mats but had no use for all that hyssop, a problem I suspect many gardeners will have with one or another of the seed selections Smith &; Hawken has made in advance for us.) <p> The real labor in growing plants from seed is not in the seed planting. Most gardeners are perfectly capable of -- and enjoy -- pushing individual seeds into the ground. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground be properly prepared, watered and weeded. <p> Still, now that they cost less than a decent bottle of wine, one of these prepackaged gardens might make a fun house gift the next time you 're invited to dinner. Just do n't expect the hostess to actually get around to planting it. <p> Seed tape and mat packages are available at Smith &; Hawken stores, through the company catalog and through the Web site : www.smithandhawken.com.

I like that rotary models can spread vast amounts of fertilizer in just a short time. I curse the fact that I ca n't keep the fertilizer from invading sidewalks, driveways and plant beds. I end up using a slow, tedious drop spreader on the borders of my lawn, then finishing with a rotary spreader. Scotts EdgeGuard combines the accuracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> EdgeGuard contains a landscape protection shield that keeps fertilizer and other nutrients on the lawn. The shield prevents fertilizer from invading unintended areas and from spreading backward onto the shoes and pants of the operator. The EdgeGuard has an extra-large hopper that holds enough fertilizer to cover up to 15,000 square feet. It also features one-touch activation of the landscape shield. EdgeGuard is available at home centers, hardware stores and nurseries. Suggested retail price is $74.99. <p> For more information visit www.scotts.com or call( 888) 270-3714. <p> -- Newsday
