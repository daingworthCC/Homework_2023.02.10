4024741 Mars buying gum maker Wrigley with financing from Buffett // CHICAGO( AP) The Oracle of Omaha is betting that the country 's candy jar is recession-proof. // With financing from Warren Buffett, candy maker Mars Inc. sings in the theme song of her hugely popular Disney Channel show, " Hannah Montana. " It 's a reference to her character 's secret double life as both a rock star AND a normal schoolgirl. // Offscreen, though, this 15-year-old phenom is starting to learn how hard it really is to have the best of both worlds : as a G-rated Disney superstar AND a real-life, growing teenager with an eye on a long career. // Cyrus, whose fresh, easy charm and down-home southern appeal have catapulted her to an astonishing level of celebrity, especially in the past year, found herself having to apologize Sunday for some entirely un-Miley photos in Vanity Fair magazine. // At a moment when she otherwise would have been relishing an amazing week a deal for her memoirs( reportedly seven figures), the cover of People magazine and a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was. This came almost certainly at the behest of worried executives at The Walt Disney Co., " available to speak for this article. // Unfortunately for Cyrus, the photos, taken in February, might not have made nearly such a splash but for a bit of awkward timing : They emerged just days after some attention-getting amateur shots of Cyrus hit the Web. In one, she tugs down a tank top to reveal a bright green bra. In another, she lies languidly on her back across a male friend, shirt raised to bare her midriff. // So the timing was terrible. But some celebrity watchers saw the developments as an attempt by Cyrus and her handlers while not necessarily calculated to look ahead a few years, beyond the tween audience. // " She has to find a way to gain a new following, " said Peter Castro, deputy managing editor of People magazine. He likened her situation to that of a butterfly still trapped in the cocoon. " She began as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but now she does n't know which way to go. She 's thinking, soon I 've got to be a butterfly. " // Biological analogies aside, Cyrus ' predicament evoked plenty of references to the cautionary tale of Britney Spears, who started on the Disney Channel about the same age as Cyrus and had her first huge hit, " Baby One More Time, " at age 17. // " Britney was in a Miley place, " said Castro. Then she decided to break out, making her persona in " Baby One More Time " a sexy schoolgirl, and doing a provocative photo shoot for Rolling Stone. " She alienated parents, but gained a whole following of older kids, " says Castro. // But, he added, " I do n't know that Miley could get away with that. I think her dad and management team are closely following Britney 's career, saying, ' Do n't let this ever happen to you. ' " // Unlike the 26-year-old Britney of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become an unwelcome cliche, the self-possessed and upbeat Cyrus has worn the title of " role model " easily. She has been utterly scandal-free until now, unless you count her failure to wear a seat belt during a car ride in her concert movie( her dad apologized for that, too). // " Miley 's at the very top of our celebrity list, " said Joanna Saltz, executive editor of Seventeen magazine, whose average reader is between 16 and 17. While Spears never appears in Seventeen, readers love Cyrus, Saltz said, because she seems genuine, unproduced, comfortable in her own skin. // " And she 's just exploded, " said Saltz. " A year ago she was the queen of tweens, and now she 's a favorite of our readers. She 's crossed all age groups. " // Just how big is this young lady, whose 70-date concert tour in 2007 sold out within minutes, who had desperate parents filing lawsuits and entering wacky endurance contests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get tickets, who herself took home $1 million a week and something close to $20 million from the tour? // " Honestly, it 's astounding, " said Rolling Stone editor Andy Greene. " She was selling 20,000-seat houses. She could have sold 80,000 a night. I spoke to one dad who said the atmosphere in there was like nothing since the early Beatles concerts. It 's hard to think of anything quite like this. " // " Hannah Montana " is the No. 1 cable series for kids aged 6-14, and if you include the networks, second only to " American Idol. " And even Cyrus ' consolation prize to fans who could n't get concert tickets, the " Best of Both Worlds Concert " 3D movie, grossed more than $60 million, a rare hit for a concert film. // Her two soundtrack albums have sold 3.5 million and 3 million copies respectively in this country, according to Nielsen SoundScan. And according to People, " Hannah Montana " merchandise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake in $1 billion this fiscal year. // Janet Koch has made her own contribution to that sum. The mother from Weston, Conn., has bought her 9-year-old daughter, Cayla, a Hannah necklace, wig, hairband, and a microphone that plays Hannah songs. Pocketbooks in every color. A cute black hoodie. A belt. Posters to cover the walls. " I draw the line at the bedding, " she quips. But Cayla can forgive that, because Mom managed to score a pair of tickets to the Cyrus concert in Hartford. // Like so many other young girls, Cayla adores Cyrus, says her mother, " because she 's someone she could see going to school with. She 's not a diva. She 's real. " // " She wants to be Miley, " her mom says. " She wants to do exactly what Miley 's doing. " // And while Cayla has n't seen the Vanity Fair photos, her mother does not think she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot worse to lose these fans. // Ultimately, whether Cyrus ' career will be hurt by these photos will come down to parents like Koch after all, many tweens wo n't even see them. // Certainly Seventeen magazine will be staying on her side. // " What happened this weekend is part of what makes her such a great role model, " says Saltz. That 's very rare to see in young celebrities today. " //
