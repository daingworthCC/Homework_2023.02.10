3047041 <p> AT age 4, most little girls adore dolls. Lynn Ahrens adored words. Now over 40, she is half of the hottest songwriting team in New York. Last season, Stephen Flaherty( music) and Ahrens( lyrics) sent the musical " Once on This Island " to Broadway and earned eight Tony nominations. <p> This week the 90-minute nonstop song-and-dance show with its 11-member cast opens Wednesday at the Curran Theater. The animated Ahrens -- with wide, velvet-brown Bambi eyes and a welcoming smile -- talked about the creative seedlings of the show. <p> Ahrens and Flaherty 's off-Broadway show " Lucky Stiff, " a musical detective farce that earned mixed reviews, had just closed and " we were getting edgy about finding something to work on, " she said. One day at Barnes &; Noble -- a well-known New York bookstore, noted for its secondhand books -- she plucked a thin volume from a shelf. Familiar with the writer, she paid her $ 1.50, took it home, read it, grabbed a cab to Flaherty 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got it. " <p> The book, " My Love, My Love, " by Trinidad-born Rosa Guy, is set in a luxuriant island in the French Antilles. <p> " I was so in love with the colorful Caribbean milieu, enchanted with the characters, the emotional quality of the story, the lyricism, that I was ready to charge forward, " Ahrens said. " Stephen, though, who is more thoughtful, held back, saying, ' Well, I do n't know too much about the Caribbean. ' But he was the one who came up with the rollicking, passionate calypso music. He is a brilliant composer. " <p> Critics agree that the songwriters have caught more than the tone, color and rhythm of that culture. They have even achieved the more difficult task of defining the socio-aesthetics of it. <p> Beguiled New York Times reviewer Frank Rich wrote, " This show is a joyous marriage of the slick and the folkloric, of the hard-nosed sophistication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical isle. Most everyone is likely to emerge from the theater ready to dance down the street. " <p> There 's an interesting added strand in the weaving of the cultures. It was Hans Christian Andersen 's " The Little Mermaid " -- the sad and beautiful tale of a mermaid and her landlocked prince -- that inspired author Guy to write her own modern interpretation of what happens when two young people from different worlds fall in love. She found it on the Caribbean island of Haiti. <p> " Yes, it 's about loving the wrong person, " Ahrens said, " a folktale of a peasant girl named Ti Moune and her passion for Daniel, the wealthy landowner 's son whom she 's saved from death. But it is n't water that keeps them apart. It 's class and skin tone and privilege and wealth and social structure and even religion, because the wealthy have Catholicism and the peasants have their gods. " <p> It took Ahrens and Flaherty six months to write the script and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent to negotiate with Guy for the rights. <p> " Eventually what Rosa asked of us was to give her an outline and perform four songs. Then she gave her permission. If she 'd said no -- well, we did n't even think of that. " <p> Ahrens believes that the musical adaptation is true to the feeling of the book, except for the ending, which is closer to the life-affirming spirit of " The Little Mermaid. " <p> " Rosa 's book ends with a harsh lesson of life in the differences between the social classes. The aristocratic mulatto Daniel takes dark-skinned unsophisticated Ti Moune as his mistress but rejects her as his potential wife, because he is committed to marry a girl of his own class. " But Ahrens and Flaherty thought that their work was n't satisfying unless they could show that something hopeful and healing could come out of their story. <p> TO MAKE the rhapsodic fable even more lyrical, the team framed the continuous song-and-dance with storytelling. During a violent thunderstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frightened child by recounting what happened on another earlier stormy night and how Ti Moune left her village seeking her love, never to return, and of the gods who presided over her destiny. <p> " I have to tell you that I think ' Once on This Island ' is a terrible title, " Ahrens admitted. " But we were in title hell for the longest time -- nothing else was even that satisfying. It 's a hard show to define. A dance piece in which song is important, a folktale, a myth, a fable. Not a musical comedy but a musical with comedy. " <p> To stage this hybrid work, all of the creative contributors had to find flexible forms of their own. Designer Loy Arcenas ' colorful minimal set gives an intimate feeling, and Judy Dearing 's folkloric costumes complement Arcenas ' simple setting. Most of all, it has been staged and choreographed by Graciela Daniele in an imaginative and animated way that uses dance and mime as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first was staged off-Broadway in sold-out performances at Playwrights Horizons and then made a chasmic leap to the Booth Theater on Broadway. <p> Neither Ahrens nor Flaherty had thought seriously of writing for Broadway until they were accepted -- separately -- at the 1982 BMI( Broadcast Music Incorporated) workshop for lyricists and composers. <p> SHE HAD DONE a lot of writing for advertising and television, including lyrics for TV 's " Schoolhouse Rock. " He had just graduated from the University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music, where he majored in composition. Writing one song together for a workshop assignment, they immediately discovered " that was it. " <p> Some people think of them as musical theater 's odd couple. Ahrens, 42, is Jewish and from New Jersey. Flaherty, 30, is Catholic and from Pittsburgh. She is married ; he is not. <p> Since both can write music and lyrics, collaboration is not always easy. " He 's a night person and I 'm a morning person. I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking until noon. So we work in the early afternoons, every day for a couple of hours. We enjoy each other 's humor. Our personalities are complementary. So we sit and talk and pace and improvise around characters and situations. I 'll ask Stephen to play something -- anything -- and I begin to hear words coming out of the music. " <p> If one were to write lyrics about Ahrens, they would tell about her birth in New York City and an early move to New Jersey, where her father is still a photographer. She grew up with a love of theater. She could sing, dance and play the piano. She is a graduate of the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University, and worked as an advertising and jingle writer. It was during that phase of her career that she met her husband, Neil Costa, an advertising art director. <p> She then honed in on television, composing and producing children 's shows. One of them, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted to write in one form or another but lyric writing was what I did for fun, " she said. <p> She and Flaherty have had three shows produced and just completed a new musical, " My Favorite Year, " which will be produced by Lincoln Center this fall. It is based on the film of the same name that starred Peter O'Toole as an alcohol-soaked Errol Flynn prance-alike. <p> For Ahrens, success and recognition have meant that more doors are now open. " I do n't mean like getting a better table at restaurants or things like that. I mean more creative opportunities, " she said. <p> " For instance, the first musical we ever collaborated on was based on the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore film ' Bedazzled, ' about a short-order cook who sells his soul to the devil for seven wishes. We worked on it for a year without even thinking about whether or not we could get the rights. And we could n't get them. We were nobodys then. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- later, their agents are negotiating. <p> " And, " Ahrens said, eyes sparkling, " we may get it after all. "
