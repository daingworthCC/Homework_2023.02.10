5121741 <h> Get Out Of My Life <p> Be yourself. Life is precious as it is. All the elements for your happiness are already here. There is no need to run, strive, search or struggle. Just Be- <p> Over the years, injury after injury. One hardship after another... Healing and building strength slowly yet again We learn something rather important about ourselves : What others think about you does n't matter. <p> Take a moment today to ask one of your friends who has ever obsessed over wanting to lose just ten more pesky pounds. You could also ask them about the time they were trying to lose that little bit of extra " stuff " around their waist. When loosing just ten more pounds is all that we focus on... Those pounds and extra " stuff " become larger and more profound daily until they fill every nook and cranny in our minds. We do this over and over again until we are convinced that it 's all anyone else can see when they look our way. <p> There are reoccurring themes and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-told quite often. One of which is making an honest( &lt; -- Key Word) effort to stay positive and making healthy choices daily. The way you present yourself deep inside has a ripple effect on those around you... <p> Set aside 30 minutes of your precious time and start rolling through this series, this is not AMRAP in 30 minutes peeps! By the time you get to your tenth set you should find yourself moving through this program effortlessly... <p> It 's been a while since I 've done something for the first time -- i.e. in my monthly goals I have a goal of finding a new interest. It 's something that obviously has to come naturally to my mind, not planned. Now that I 'm almost 100% recuperated from doing the test for both history courses, I can learn how to use Illustrator, MS Windows Movie Maker, and writing fiction. <p> The thing about me being fat -- a guy who liked me for me( and not my looks) never cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair -- or wore whatever. <p> Yeah I know... I need to stop being a people pleaser and do what 's in my best interest and only care about what I think about myself. <p> I know I 'm not a jerk so I have no worries that I 'll talk and treat others awfully. <p> Of course... there is that communication style -- different from one person to the next. <p> Thanks for this post... it almost feels like you have read my recent post and instead of responding to it on my page, you have added it as a post on yours. Either way is great! I like to be able to contribute my thoughts on your pages. <p> You are such an amazing and empowering woman, thank you for your continued support. I like to think that there is a sense of community over here, where we are free to share our thoughts and be who we truly are. Take care once again and be well!!! <p> great messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log on and read something that makes sense and that can be reflected upon and hopefully applied to make
