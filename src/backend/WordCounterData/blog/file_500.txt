5158441 <h> Actually Romney is the face of Mormonism <p> He is a faithful husband. He and his wife were willing to bring children into the world. There seems to be plenty of evidence that he has provided for their well-being and protection. He and his wife cherish the family. <p> He is loyal to his country. <p> He pays an honest tithe and generous offerings to help those in need. <p> He has taken care of his health. <p> He attends his Church meetings. <p> He has served in a variety of capacities in the Church without pay or much recognition. <p> He has shown that he can teach and speak and be a counselor. <p> He reads and enjoys the scriptures. <p> He meets the standards to attend and participate in temple worship. <p> He prays personally, with his wife, with his family, and with others. <p> He has a witness of Father in Heaven 's ruling hand and recognizes the role of Jesus Christ as Savior, Redeemer, and Deliverer. <p> So we ought to consider this statement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nation be safe under the leadership of arrogant, profane, puny little men without faith in God, no matter how much material or military power is put into their hands.... Would that we could again see a modern General George Washington who kneels at his Valley Forge, or see again through the half-open door into a modern Abraham Lincoln 's room in the White House the anguished form of a man kneeling in prayer and hear the low tones of that prayer : ' Oh, thou God that heard Solomon in the night when he prayed for wisdom, hear me. I can not lead this people ; I can not guide the affairs of this nation without thy help. I am poor and weak and sinful. Oh God, who did hear Solomon when he cried for wisdom, hear me and save this nation. ' " <p> Romney is much more than a face. There is a strong indication that a purposeful life, a spirit driven life, reached his heart and mind at an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( the face so to speak) and will never look much further. <p> There are good men like Romney on the earth. Actually he is only one face out of many faithful and loyal men inside and outside the Mormon Church. I think part of what makes this election intriguing is we have n't had such a man this close to the presidential chair in a long time. <p> I 'm with the previous commenters. I worry about the character of a fellow high priest who so enthusiastically spouts verifiable lies. This is the man the blogger wants running the nation? Not me. Why did this Mormon have to be the first to get a major-party nomination? Why could n't it have been a more honorable, honest Latter-Day Saint? <p> The press says he lies( and the Democrats) but that does n't make it true. They 're all in the same anti-Republican bag. Read more sources including personal accounts of Romney and you 'll be satisfied as I am that he is what Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel in action in some very personal ways, especially at the RNC. He paints a positive( and stark) contrast to the image of the gospel that Harry Reid projects! Looking forward to more columns. <p> You 're so correct. Sen Reid actually understands the gospel and lives it by working tirelessly for the everyday common man. Whereas Gov. Romney works for the 1% and the wealthy of the world. Unless I missed something in the scriptures, Christ takes a dim view of worshipping Mammon. <p> Making money does n't make you worship Mammon. It 's not like Romney made his millions while serving in public office, like Harry Reid. And he sure donates more than anyone could expect. I 'd like to see if Harry Reid donates his own money as much as he spends taxpayers ' money! <p> It seems that many commenters believe the press about Romney. This is a mistake. The media reference polls weighted unrealistically towards Democrats -- above even 2008 levels. They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't report many available personal accounts of Romney that sing his praises. How many anti-Obama headlines have you seen compared to anti-Romney ones? The answer does n't say as much about the two men as it does about the bias of those who write about them. <p> You have to read both sides for balanced coverage because it does n't exist in one place and both sides leave stuff out. How can you make an informed opinion about Romney or any other subject if you consider only one( flawed) point of view? You ca n't. Thanks for listening. http : **35;1650;TOOLONG... <p> The issue, for non-Mormons, is the scenario that is quite obvious to them : Romney 's primary allegiance is to his God &; church. That is not questionable. Also, his history with Bain shows that he will gut a failing business without remorse, profit greatly, and not care for the damaged people left in his wake. What he did was legal, and very profitable to him and the Mormon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all American should be aware that he will *legally* do everything in his power as President to 1) move the country towards the hoped-for theocracy, and 2) profit greatly while appropriately tithing to his church. After that -- the fate of America is irrelevant to him, like the fate of those left in the wake of Bain. <p> Funny how those who attack Romney about Bain Capital NEVER talk about the many companies he was able to save along with 10? s of thousands of jobs. No, they have to pick the ones he tried to save but were too far gone. Those companies would have caved in regardless of what Bain could do for them. What 's important is Romney tried to help those companies anyway even though he probably knew they could not survive. <p> Las Vegas Richard, who says Reid works tiredly for the poor? Where do you have proof of this? Was GM or the Banks that were bailed out by Reid, Obama and Bush poor??? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained great wealth through his public service. Romney did it in the private sector, not taking wealth from the poor. And, you do know Obama just bought property worth $40 million dollars in Hawaii. Why did n't Obama give that money to his government to spread his wealth around??? Sounds like Obama is working for the 1% including him and Reid while Romney will give real opportunity back to the poor and middle
