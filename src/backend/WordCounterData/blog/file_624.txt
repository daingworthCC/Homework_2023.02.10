Webster <p> RATING : 3 / 5 I love space, and I love horror. Therefore, I love space horror. The Dark Side of the Moon is definitely not a great film( which is a given considering it is a straight to video B-movie) but it was still endearing enough to like and have fun with. <p> The year is 2022. A spaceship is sent to lunar orbit to do maintenance on a satellite carrying nuclear missiles. While up there, something goes wrong with the engine, and the ship has 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon. Even stranger, one of those " old " US shuttles, the Discovery, which has gone missing 30 years earlier, floats up to the ship out of nowhere and docks with them, but no one emerges from it. The crew must go investigate the shuttle and find out what has happened to it. <p> In a way, The Dark Side of the Moon is a bit of a spiritual precursor to Event Horizon( do n't expect anywhere near the quality though, this is a B-movie after all). It blends genres in virtually the same way that Event Horizon did, it just presents the concept slightly differently. It has some funky ideas, like extending the influence of some common Earth lore up to space. It does get pretty damn cheesy as it progresses but you could at last envision that the idea would be cool with a bigger budget. <p> Surprisingly, I actually did n't mind the actors. They did pretty well for a B-movie, and had some fun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did " cold machine " well, and delivered the most hilarious final line. The main character was n't great but he was still likable. There was only one actor who was pretty damn terrible. I do n't need to mention who it is, you will know if you watch the film. <p> The Dark Side of the Moon wo n't provide you with a very poignant horror experience or anything, but it is a great fun movie to watch on a sunny Sunday afternoon when you do n't want
