5108841 <p> I 'm an unabashed fan of Devin Faraci, and I do n't care who knows it. I think he has a really great prose style, and even when I do n't agree with him I always know how he came to his conclusions. That said, if you do n't know him socially he can come off as caustic and abrasive. Passionate people often are. <p> Last night, Devin challenged Joe Swanberg, the " King of Mumblecore ", to a very dry, reasoned debate on the quality of the genre. Oh, who am I kidding - the Fantastic Debates are never about the intelligentsia calmly discussing in a rational manner about their intellectual prowess. There 's insults, impassioned discusion, more insults, and then they beat the shit out of each other. Devin holds the strongly held opinion that mumblecore as a style of filmmaking is essentially worthless, and Swanberg, of course takes the opposite view. I admire Devin 's wit here, but I also think Swanberg raised some good points and spoke from the heart. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fighting was pretty decisive. Swanberg, to put it mildly, cleaned Devin 's fucking clock. <p> Personally, I can take or leave mumblecore, depending on how well each particular movie works. But judging from this fight, the decision has been taken out of our hands - mumblecore will be here to stay. <p> Hell, even the trailer for Vamps was kind of cool. I have no fucking idea what this article is about, nor do I care. Maybe the people bitching about the state of this site are actually onto something.. <p> Laws are just something old people and fat unfit douchebags made up so they would n't get killed by all the strong and powerful young people. <p> I 'm so sick of our society where no one can lay a hand on another without potentially going to jail for it. People deserve to get their ass kicked all the time, and if they did the world would be a lot better for it. <p> I really wish I lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing some of your shit, or banging your wife, you were heralded as a champion and an honorable man rather than getting shit on and thrown in jail. <p> Laws are just something old people and fat unfit douchebags made up so they would n't get killed by all the strong and powerful young people.

I really wish I lived in another era, where if you killed someone for stealing some of your shit, or banging your wife, you were heralded as a champion and an honorable man rather than getting shit on and thrown in jail. <p> I 've honestly never heard of Swanberg, but seeing him beat the shit out of Devin has certainly made my day. <p> I do n't care how good of a writer Devin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), he 's pretty much a professional troll at this point, not a film critic. And it 's about time someone put him in his place. <p> I 've honestly never heard of Swanberg, but seeing him beat the shit out of Devin has certainly made my day.

And it 's about time someone put him in his place. <p> It 's just more cinema done, outside Holywood 's compartimentized system. Who knows where the next Kubrick might show up? Perhaps there already is one doing his first steps in mumblecore. So why should anybody oppose it? And what 's the deal with Faraci 's enemity of movies with more free form type of narratives? Does he think that the only type of narrative that matters is where things happen by going A to B to C? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to see it that way. I mean, look at Bethoeven, he did n't give a fuck about the nobility who up to then used musicians and composers as their private employees, Bethoeven composed for himself, and look at what he did! He was being self-indulgence, you could say, but he create masterpieces of world music. <p> I just do n't get this Faraci dude. What does he really want from movies? <p> It 's just more cinema done, outside Holywood 's compartimentized system. Who knows where the next Kubrick might show up?

What does he really want from movies? <p> while a lot of current indie movies have great stories, there some times annoying to watch at moments because they will be set in modern times yet you will see 70 's clothing style, 70 's technology, and 70 's interior design. 90 's indie movies did n't have that. <p> while a lot of current indie movies have great stories, there some times annoying to watch at moments because they will be set in modern times yet you will see 70 's clothing style, 70 's technology, and 70 's interior design. 90 's indie movies did n't have that. <p> I 've been a fan of Devins a long time, so sue me. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, yeah, he 's kind of a prick at times, but one I can tolerate, and I would say I do find myself agreeing with him more than I do disagreeing with him. <p> Mumblecore is a shit genre that is exactly as he describes it. I often refer to it as being indie excess crap. Basically, you take all that 's bad and those sort of true stereotypes about indie, wrap it up into a ball, and yeah, any asshole can take a camera and shoot things with it, but it takes a master craftsman to make something outstanding. <p> Yeah, anything with core at the end, should be something awesome, as Devin puts it. Mumblecore is not. It 's boring and pointless and no real story or structure to it. Narcissistic self indulgent crap, which may not nec always be a bad thing, but mumblecore is not a good example of such. It is pretty bland. <p> Now, you could say, and I tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core, Linklatter, Jarmusch, and Smith. Thing is, while their camerawork or direction might not be the greatest, and that 's not a putdown, their writing and storytelling is very good, and that 's good enough for me. I 'm not blaiming them for it, it was something inadvertant that happened, but it had an influence. Blaiming them for it is like blaiming Faith No More, an awesome band, for shit like rap-rock and nu-metal, two totally un-connected things. <p> Round 1, Devin. <p> Swanberg just sounds like your typical indie nerd, trying to make his " important personal work ", out to be than it is. Really? Age of technology that gives us a voice, but you use it to squash those. Oh man, I do n't know whether to laugh or roll my eyes at that one. Swanberg, and those who think like him, time to put on the big boy pants, grow a little thicker skin, and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basing your whole view/point/movement, and whether it suceeds or fails, on some critic? Wow. That 's a load of week b.s if I ever heard it. <p> Here 's the thing too, and I hate judging movies and entertainment based on this cause it 's so superficial, however, it 's reality. If mumblecore were this groundbreaking revolution that those who identify as such types of filmmakers, was this big thing, it would be making more money and be all the buzz. But it 's not cause people tend to know crap when they see it. <p> But for the fight its self, now, I do like Devin and I 'm on his side on this, but uh, it makes him look like the stereotypical know it all nerd who can talk a big talk, but ca n't really say anything with his fists. But I think that can account for alot of people. <p> Also Swanberg, Uwe Boll, who some say is the worst director ever, did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, took what his critics said WAY too personal, and fought them. Now, Boll surprisingly cleaned there clocks, and that 's not a congratulation. No, no, you just did something as low as Uwe Boll. How does it feel? <p> I 've been a fan of Devins a long time, so sue me. I think he 's a very keen, observant and smart writer, yeah, he 's kind of a prick at times, but one I can tolerate, and I would say I do find myself agreeing with him more than I do disagreeing with him.

How does it feel? <p> Idk if i 'd nec say I thought it was better, but I did enjoy Terminator Salvation more than Avatar. Look, Avatar is Dances With Wolves set in space, just accept it.

Biggest domestic gross of all time for a superhero movie, and it bypassed Comic-Con altogether. Preaching to a choir and spending what can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege might not be the best way to go. Especially since a big, splashy presentation has become far less special. It 's now the norm -- hardly even a news event. After you fly in your A-list movie stars, put them up in a Hard Rock Hotel suite and pay their $2,000-a-day makeup person and stylist, is their 45-minute appearance going to translate into global ticket sales six or 12 months later? Probably not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by buzz and big box office( Avatar in 2009, Avengers last year). <p> But you could probably still generate that same media attention from a strong trailer or viral campaign via a team of hardworking marketers and publicists. And less competition fighting for ink. Now, if studios want to support Comic-Con as a gift to the fans, good for them. But if they 're trying to sell movie tickets -- and is n't that the point? -- save your money for a broader campaign. And may the force be with you. <p> from whogottherole.com : Things did n't go well for Lionsgate Dredd. Showing in 2,506 locations, the film was only able to make a depressing $6.3 million. That 's just half of what the original Judge Dredd, starring Sylvester Stallone made. Despite fair reviews from critics and a B CinemaScore, Dredd is on track to make less than $20 million for its entire run. <p> from joblo.com : After its premiere at Comic Con this year, fans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular British comic book created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra and starring Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, and Lena Headey. Directed by Pete Travis, the ultraviolent, slick, and brutal pic was primed to be a solid hit in the hard-R action genre. Sitting at 77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and with most fan reaction being positive, DREDD 3D looked to have it in the bag. <p> Then, the numbers came in. A paltry $6 million over a slow weekend in September, competing with the likes of a Clint Eastwood baseball movie, a cheesy horror flick, and a cop drama, DREDD 3D was buried, making only half of what its competition pulled in, which, aside for END OF WATCH, had negative reviews. Audiences were loud and clear that they did n't much care for what DREDD 3D had to offer or they simply did n't know enough about it to give a shit. Even with an aggressive campaign by Lionsgate, the trailers and TV spots did little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell happened? I left the theater feeling fully satiated by what I 'd seen. DREDD 3D felt like an issue of the comic brought to life, with all the character, blood, gore, brutality, and deadpan comedy one could ask for. In my mind, it was one of the best comic adaptations I 'd seen to date. When I saw the numbers on Sunday I was floored. HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET and TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE beat DREDD 3D? They 're sitting at 11% and 52% on Rotten Tomatoes! <p> DREDD 3D 's failure brings up a number of questions : Are audiences tired of comic book flicks? They 've certainly been inundated with them recently( and will continue to be). Are audiences playing it safe with go-to genres and established names? Jennifer Lawrence is hot off THE HUNGER GAMES and Eastwood is hot off his RNC " chair " speech, so why not? Are audiences " tamed " to PG-13 movies? Have they simply learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? In recent years, we 've seen the R-rated action genre take a hit, while the comedy genre got a boost. Too many questions with no solid answers. <p> THE EXPENDABLES 2 originally was shooting for a PG-13 before an R, adding some CGI blood( with almost no profanity) to give the fans " what they want. " Did it make that big of a difference to audiences in terms of ticket sales? Well, it still has n't made back it 's $100 million budget, so there 's that. A PG-13 almost always adds a bigger tally, since it opens up to a wider audience. That said, it 's always possible that HOUSE and CURVE are counting money that actually belongs to DREDD 3D, as kids will typically buy a ticket for a PG-13 movie and sneak into an R-rated one( I know I did). I 'll give END OF WATCH its due credit as it earned the top spot with an R-rating and great reviews. <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-rating. Without the hardcore violence it would 've lost all edge as the badass film that it is and robbed it completely of its source material integrity. A PG-13 would 've been a sell out. However, that sell out may have been a prettier picture for Lionsgate 's returns. So, who really wins? Which brings me to my next train of thought ; Are some movies destined to be cult films? When you consider the box office of movies like THE EVIL DEAD, FIGHT CLUB, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, OFFICE SPACE, etc., one of the most common traits is their box office failure, with each of them carrying an R-rating. <p> To me, DREDD 3D seemed to have a wider appeal than cult status, but I 'm biased as hell. I 'm a comic nerd/film geek, so my thoughts on the matter can be jaded. The average moviegoer seeing a **40;5314;TOOLONG... may view the concept as far too odd. DREDD 3D, after all, is n't a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as THE AVENGERS or Batman. As a character, he 's low on the totem pole in terms of popularity ; so to sell him on the heels of his comic roots was always going to be tough. <p> Then, there 's the issue of the female audience. Let 's face it ; most women are n't into blood-soaked action flicks. Call me sexist, but it 's true. I 'm sure a poll in Cosmopolitan would reveal the truth. Chicks want romance, love, and comedy for the most part( which is n't to say they ca n't appreciate some badass action) of which DREDD 3D has none. There is n't the slightest hint at romance, with Dredd playing it straight from start to finish. Regardless, Olivia Thirlby as Judge Anderson is awesome, exuding strength, vulnerability, and perseverance in a role that easily could 've been a cheesy annoyance. In the ads, however, she 's played off as nothing more than a presence in the film, rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good film is a hard thing to figure out and the consequences of that failure can be far-reaching. I 'm not upset about the loss of sequel potential as much as I am about an R-rated action flick done right being punished for doing so. It 's a slap to the studio for taking the risk and a signal that audiences do n't want R-rated action movies, but PG-13 warmed over dogshit. It 's harsh, but true. The truth is in the numbers and unfortunately, when it all comes down to it, the numbers will determine what we 'll see next. I 'm hopeful that more filmmakers and studios will continue to take the risk in the future, but sadly, I think we 'll be seeing more trite PG-13 schlock than kick ass R-rated paragons, like DREDD 3D. <p> I say : Enough geek-pain, I think, as the geek audience is resoundingly told " NO! WE HATE THAT Y0U EXIST! " yet again with this weekend 's box-office. <p> from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombed with just $6.3 million from 2,506 locations.

PHOTOS : Comic-Con 2012 : 6 All-Stars Talk Knife-Wielding Fans, Mortifying Auditions and How Their Shows Should End at THR 's Roundtable After all, many would argue that the people who attend every year would see a genre movie or superhero tentpole no matter what.

Preaching to a choir and spending what can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege might not be the best way to go. Especially since a big, splashy presentation has become far less special. It 's now the norm -- hardly even a news event. After you fly in your A-list movie stars, put them up in a Hard Rock Hotel suite and pay their $2,000-a-day makeup person and stylist, is their 45-minute appearance going to translate into global ticket sales six or 12 months later? Probably not. Sure, there are examples of Comic-Con presentations that were followed by buzz and big box office( Avatar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 : First Look at Posters for ' The Vampire Diaries, ' ' Supernatural, ' ' Following ' and More But you could probably still generate that same media attention from a strong trailer or viral campaign via a team of hardworking marketers and publicists. And less competition fighting for ink. Now, if studios want to support Comic-Con as a gift to the fans, good for them. But if they 're trying to sell movie tickets -- and is n't that the point? -- save your money for a broader campaign. And may the force be with you. from whogottherole.com : Things did n't go well for Lionsgate Dredd. Showing in 2,506 locations, the film was only able to make a depressing $6.3 million. That 's just half of what the original Judge Dredd, starring Sylvester Stallone made. Despite fair reviews from critics and a B CinemaScore, Dredd is on track to make less than $20 million for its entire run. from joblo.com : After its premiere at Comic Con this year, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reboot of the popular British comic book created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra and starring Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, and Lena Headey. Directed by Pete Travis, the ultraviolent, slick, and brutal pic was primed to be a solid hit in the hard-R action genre. Sitting at 77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and with most fan reaction being positive, DREDD 3D looked to have it in the bag. Then, the numbers came in. A paltry $6 million over a slow weekend in September, competing with the likes of a Clint Eastwood baseball movie, a cheesy horror flick, and a cop drama, DREDD 3D was buried, making only half of what its competition pulled in, which, aside for END OF WATCH, had negative reviews. Audiences were loud and clear that they did n't much care for what DREDD 3D had to offer or they simply did n't know enough about it to give a shit. Even with an aggressive campaign by Lionsgate, the trailers and TV spots did little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell happened? I left the theater feeling fully satiated by what I 'd seen. DREDD 3D felt like an issue of the comic brought to life, with all the character, blood, gore, brutality, and deadpan comedy one could ask for. In my mind, it was one of the best comic adaptations I 'd seen to date. When I saw the numbers on Sunday I was floored. HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET and TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE beat DREDD 3D? They 're sitting at 11% and 52% on Rotten Tomatoes! DREDD 3D 's failure brings up a number of questions : Are audiences tired of comic book flicks? They 've certainly been inundated with them recently( and will continue to be). Are audiences playing it safe with go-to genres and established names? Jennifer Lawrence is hot off THE HUNGER GAMES and Eastwood is hot off his RNC " chair " speech, so why not? Are audiences " tamed " to PG-13 movies? Have they simply learned to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent years, we 've seen the R-rated action genre take a hit, while the comedy genre got a boost. Too many questions with no solid answers. THE EXPENDABLES 2 originally was shooting for a PG-13 before an R, adding some CGI blood( with almost no profanity) to give the fans " what they want. " Did it make that big of a difference to audiences in terms of ticket sales? Well, it still has n't made back it 's $100 million budget, so there 's that. A PG-13 almost always adds a bigger tally, since it opens up to a wider audience. That said, it 's always possible that HOUSE and CURVE are counting money that actually belongs to DREDD 3D, as kids will typically buy a ticket for a PG-13 movie and sneak into an R-rated one( I know I did). I 'll give END OF WATCH its due credit as it earned the top spot with an R-rating and great reviews. I do n't think DREDD 3D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardcore violence it would 've lost all edge as the badass film that it is and robbed it completely of its source material integrity. A PG-13 would 've been a sell out. However, that sell out may have been a prettier picture for Lionsgate 's returns. So, who really wins? Which brings me to my next train of thought ; Are some movies destined to be cult films? When you consider the box office of movies like THE EVIL DEAD, FIGHT CLUB, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, OFFICE SPACE, etc., one of the most common traits is their box office failure, with each of them carrying an R-rating. To me, DREDD 3D seemed to have a wider appeal than cult status, but I 'm biased as hell. I 'm a comic nerd/film geek, so my thoughts on the matter can be jaded. The average moviegoer seeing a **40;5356;TOOLONG... may view the concept as far too odd. DREDD 3D, after all, is n't a well-known comic in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batman. As a character, he 's low on the totem pole in terms of popularity ; so to sell him on the heels of his comic roots was always going to be tough. Then, there 's the issue of the female audience. Let 's face it ; most women are n't into blood-soaked action flicks. Call me sexist, but it 's true. I 'm sure a poll in Cosmopolitan would reveal the truth. Chicks want romance, love, and comedy for the most part( which is n't to say they ca n't appreciate some badass action) of which DREDD 3D has none. There is n't the slightest hint at romance, with Dredd playing it straight from start to finish. Regardless, Olivia Thirlby as Judge Anderson is awesome, exuding strength, vulnerability, and perseverance in a role that easily could 've been a cheesy annoyance. In the ads, however, she 's played off as nothing more than a presence in the film, rather than a major player with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard thing to figure out and the consequences of that failure can be far-reaching. I 'm not upset about the loss of sequel potential as much as I am about an R-rated action flick done right being punished for doing so. It 's a slap to the studio for taking the risk and a signal that audiences do n't want R-rated action movies, but PG-13 warmed over dogshit. It 's harsh, but true. The truth is in the numbers and unfortunately, when it all comes down to it, the numbers will determine what we 'll see next. I 'm hopeful that more filmmakers and studios will continue to take the risk in the future, but sadly, I think we 'll be seeing more trite PG-13 schlock than kick ass R-rated paragons, like DREDD 3D. I say : Enough geek-pain, I think, as the geek audience is resoundingly told " NO! WE HATE THAT Y0U EXIST! " yet again with this weekend 's box-office. What to expect in the future : *the shuttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) *no more DREDD movies( HAHAHAHAHAHA!) *few obscure comic properties( HAHAHAHA!) *No more " From the Mind of visionary ' x ' " *no more R-rated actioners( HAHAHAHA!) *PG-13 horror/action trash( HAHAHAHAHA!) *ROBOCOP remake PG-13( HAHAHAHAHA!) *ALL future sci-fi/fantasy PG-13( HAHAHAHA!) ca n't stop laughing at you all.
