5164941 <p> Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, who teaches at the Stanford University School of Medicine, writes from Etosha National Park in Namibia, where she is studying elephant societies. <p> Wednesday, July 18 <p> I was caught in the eye of a female elephant storm at the bunker this afternoon while trying to engage in an interview about Wynona 's family with members of a film crew who were parked with their long lens near the tower. Suddenly, Zena, from Left Tusker 's family, came barreling in from the southeast like a steam engine, aggressively forcing Wynona 's family away from not only the prime drinking spot, but the entire water hole. I was amazed by Zena 's determination to keep the others at bay while her family drank in peace -- that was until Smokey arrived and added to the chaos by inspecting very vocal females for estrus and chasing away any adult bull that might be a potential threat, even though none of the others were in musth, as he was. <p> The clearing was packed full of elephants, the younger bulls taking advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to test their strength and dominance by mounting each other. It was all-out elephant mayhem, and I was in the thick of it, not wanting to leave despite the sun 's disappearance. But it was too dark to film so we called it a day and headed back to a very quiet camp, where my students were holding down the fort. <p> A long-term research project of this scale could not be done without a talented team of dedicated students and volunteers. The duties in camp include maintaining individual photo ID 's on our study elephants, dictating and entering behavioral interactions into an electronic data logger, videotaping all interactions, mapping and processing fecal samples, running and troubleshooting acoustic and seismic playback experiments, and maintaining a complicated camp run on solar energy -- not to mention cooking with very few resources. The film operation is on top of all this, so we needed extra solar panels and 220-volt power inverters to deal with the extra load. So far, all of our energy requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink at sunset. We are running a fully green operation, from research to filming to kitchen, right down to camp security and the electric fence. <p> The team members and their skills weighed heavily on my mind as I watched half of them leave this morning. The past two weeks have flown by. Four members left and only one additional person will join us for the next two-week session. It will be a lot quieter in the camp, but I anticipate that with fewer hands on deck, we will be even busier with the elephants, particularly without Tim, who could stay for only half the time, to help me troubleshoot equipment failures. But every season is like this. It 's just never easy to have to say goodbye. <p> As the season progresses, several new bulls have been identified, documented and named. A brief word on naming : We keep a running record of all of our elephant sightings and keep a catalog of identifications for each individual. We look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawings of each ear, the tusks and tail, as well as age class and overall appearance. Bull No. 38 is the 38th bull that we cataloged back in 2004, nearly nine years ago. We now have more than 160 bulls on record from this region. My research assistant nicknamed No. 38 Willie Nelson, because of his raggedy but impressive appearance and long scraggly tail. <p> The dominant bull, Greg, was named in 2004 after the lead elephant keeper at the Oakland Zoo, where we conduct some of our seismic studies. It was clear from the start that he was dominant, so he got his name because of the status of his namesake. Smokey was named after the Oakland Zoo 's musth bull because he was the first musth bull we documented at Mushara. <p> Many of the names we use were given based on physical characteristics, a few were based on namesakes and a few on character as originally documented on first sighting. Although the naming of research subjects has an inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naming subjects for a very long time and it does help in remembering individuals. In order to avoid biases in naming, all of my original names for family groups were based on some kind of aberration that was easily recognizable within the group, hence the names Bent Ear, Slit Ear or Left Hook. Finally, my research team had had enough of my defect-naming strategy and started to have a little more fun with names that were overall more kind to the subject. Eventually, I relented. <p> Caitlin O'Connell and Tim Rodwell The observation tower under the Milky Way on a new moon night. <p> As rhinos grumble in the pitch black night, a new elephant family that I ca n't identify, even with night vision, arrives at the water hole. It 's just too dark out there. From the third floor of the tower, it seems as if the Southern Cross in the sky is right in front of me, that I could reach out and grab hold of my nightly kite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Mushara. Tomorrow is another day of hope and restocking of the camp when the rest of the researcher interested in writing about your own field work? Send
