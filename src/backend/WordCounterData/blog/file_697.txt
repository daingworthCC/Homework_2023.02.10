5178241 <h> Share this on : <p> One man 's " disgusting " is another man 's really rockin ' dim sum. I ca n't say I 'm completely at one with the choice of the wording for this CNN Go iReport assignment " The most disgusting foods in the world, " but then, it points to a longstanding problem with terminology for the category. <p> TV host Andrew Zimmern, who sets the gold standard for adventurous global eating, goes with " bizarre. " Others opt for " oddity, " " exotic, " or the often euphemistically-employed " delicacy " to describe highly-localized, often animal derived( though there 's always natto), sometimes fetal, fermented or pungent or deliberately rotted or maggot infested... Okay, some of it is pretty gnarly, but if we 're gon na go with the word " disgusting, " I would choose to eat the aforementioned natto( gooey, fermented soybeans), savory haggis( spiced sheep heart, liver and lungs mixed with oatmeal and cooked in the animal 's stomach), blood pudding, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or innards before I 'd even think of jamming down any manner of Pocket, brick or Hungry Girl-sanctioned cheese replacement. <h> We recommend <h> From around the web <h> sound off( 375 Responses) <p> BearAttack <p> As a chefof thirty years, I have prided myself on trying unusual foods. Testicles, hearts, tripes, intestines, I 've eaten them all no problem. BUT they need to be well-prepared by the cook, or it can be a really evil and traumatic experience. When I was eight years old, good ol Moms decided that we needed to have some beef liver. She basically just fried it up in a pan, and it even smaelled bad. She tried to force me to eat it. I got through the second bite and threw up all over the dinner table. For some reason we never saw liver again... to this day, when I make pate I have to add enough booze to it that you ca n't taste the liver. NOW I KNOW people love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Deep batter fried Baby Ruth bars at a Georgia country fair. For some obscene, twisted reason my daughter forces me to buy these atrocities for her and then makes me watch her eat them. The sickening combined smell of the three-day-old frying oil, cloying burnt chocolate and the sight of the stretchy, warm caramel innards( which seem to have the consistency and color of half-dried intestinal mucus) make me dry heave and get blood pressure/insulin spikes ; I try to avert my eyes... <p> I 'm surprised, well I guess really not given what most Americans often eat, that so many would choose a processed frozen meal over animal heart. Heart is just muscle like almost every other " meat " we eat. I 've long loved chicken hearts and recently had a meal of beef heart and liver chunks sauteed with vegetables which was absolutely delicious. I 'm sure if more people tried heart with an open mind they would prefer it over frozen processed who-knows-what's-in-it meals. <p> I was raised on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a chance to eat real food, I took it. My favorite new food acquisitions are Portuguese cod tongue and eggs, Spanish blood sausage( if you can find morcilla enchorizada, do it! With some onions before you add the crude rice to fry and boil, heaven), and here in Mexico head tacos( eyes, ears, mouth palette, and cheek), casadillas of brains( go to the mountains around Mexico City), and spine soup( the spine liquid gets like pasta when cooked). Unfortunately, I still do n't dig on chicharon or panza, and Sicilian paninni di cavallo tasted( and was chewed) exactly like it sounds. Anyone else tried these guys? What 'd ya think? <p> God told the Jewish nation to tell the other nations in the world what humans should eat. I do nt think they did a good job. Many have died because of diseases caused by wrong dietary habit. God hold them responsible, and those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know. What are you going to do? <p> Nobody ever taught me in Sunday school class that God said you shouldnt eat certain things. The Christians say that the Old Testament laws have been done away with. This is a new day. RIGHTTTTT. Now we can eat anything we want, Andrew Zimmer. Why would God tell you that something is not good for you then say its alright now. God " meant what He said and said what He meant " <p> So we should start sacrificing animals again, too? Specific instructions were given for certain reasons in the Old Testament. When we FAILED as a human race( several times) is when Jesus was introduced and the " rules " changed. The purpose of the Old Testament is not only for spiritual health, but also a very stark reminder of how much we suck as humans and that only God is perfect. He knew it would happen all along, but we did n't so He allowed us to fall flat on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid not to touch the stove and they argue with you, touch it, and come crying back to you apologizing that they were wrong. <p> Okay, folks, here is the grossest : In Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries, you can go to a local market and find big vats of deep fried waterbugs. That 's right, we 're talking enormous roaches. And they eat them by the bagfull, just like potato chips. <p> In Mexico they like the bugs, too. Roasted crickets are common in local markets, and so are little rolled paper cones of live bugs( they sell several different kinds alive, so I could n't give you a name). The crickets were crunchy like stale popcorn and the legs which get stuck in your teeth require serious flossing, but the live bugs remained beyond my sense of adventurous eating. How were the water bugs? Did they put spices on them? Chili, lime, and salt are popular with the crickets here. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way. It was all I could do to even look at them. Years ago I had a basement apartment in NYC and every now and then a waterbug would find its way inside. I 'm sure they heard my screams in New Jersey. <p> Living abroad will certainly change your mind about what is disgusting to eat and what is not. <p> I used to be grossed out by even looking at snails, now I ca n't get enough when there in season here in Southern Spain. They latest thing I 've tried and struggled to get through was pig ear. It was the texture more than anything. I 'm sure I 'll try it again next year when my mother-in-law makes her wonderful winter soup, and I 'm sure that eventually I 'll get used to it and actually start to like it just like I did with snails. <p> Of course, I used to think tomatoes were disgusting too( another thing that 's changed since moving to Spain). Maybe I 'm not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> I know this article is standing in one personal opinion, but still the word " disgusting " is not suitable. To you it might be disgusting to eat feet of pigs or chicken, but to them it might be also disgusting that you are eating frozen microwaved maded food everyday. To some religions, it is big tabboo to eat pork, or cow because pork is " disgusting " and cow is " holly ". But here in US, most of people eat pork or beef every single day. Before using the word, think WHY these foods have been so popular and accepted by the peopl in hundreds years. In turkey, they eat brain of sheep after couple drinks. Because they know it prevents you from terrbible hang over next day. In Japan, they eat Natto because it contains a lot of nutritions and decreases the rate of cancer and other diseases. These foods are not disgusting, these foods are culture and wisdom of ancient people. <p> I 've concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seeming " cool " in front of one 's friends. It also pretty much sums up the French culture. " This is the most disgusting thing I 've ever seen! I 'm going to put it in my mouth! " I will NEVER be that hungry. These people need to find hobbies. <p> They say that pigs are pretty much the closest animal to humans, genetically. That 's why you can have pig parts used to fix things like your heart( Arnold Schwarzennegar has a pig heart valve). I wonder if that means that humans would taste like pork? Where 's Jeffrey Dahmer when you need ' em.... <p> I love gizzards. I sometimes get a craving for them so I buy a package of chicken gizzards and flour them then deep fry. Lots of salt. I normally eat very healthy but sometimes... nothin else will do! :) <p> my dad said he ate dog while he lived in Vietnam. i thought it was beyond weird. especially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when i was 12. while explaining the necessities like feeding and bathing etc, he found it necessary to clarify that he was not " feeding " me. <p>... frankly, I think a person should try anything once. You never know what you might like. I 've tried all sorts of weird things, from pig ears stewed in green chile, to grey Chinese-style chicken feet, or even chicken-head soup, and I have to say, just because it looks/sounds disgusting, does n't mean you should n't try it. Personally, I really want to try Giant Asian Hornet honey... but I 'm saving it until I 'm sure I 'm about to die, since I 'm 99% sure that I 'd go into anaphylaxic shock from it...( http : **35;4394;TOOLONG...) Still, it looks so interesting, I ca n't help but want to try it... <p> It really depends on the culture. Meat is basically cooked muscle and fat, it 's disgusting too, if you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially goose liver, it just needs to be washed very carefully, otherwise it can be unbearably bitter. I 've had pork blood sausage a few times, it 's baked like normal sausage, and is not fluid at all( it 's like a sponge). It just needs to be processed immediately after the animal dies, because it spoils easily. I would completely avoid bugs, they 're very smelly. Almost as bad as sea food. : -) <p> What 's " disgusting " and what is not is mostly a matter of perception. I think most of these " challenging " foods actually taste pretty good. Take lobster, for example. If lobsters were land animals nobody would touch them. Eating a tarantula spider would make most people puke, but I 've read that they taste like lobster, which makes a lot of sense. Not too many people eat beef tongue. Makes sense as eating something that used to lick cattle butt is n't that appealing. But beef tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steer. <p> The sad part is most everyone that will point and ridicule one culture 's food will happily down some nasty mess from some fast food chain that 's probably less healthy than the food they 're takling negatively about. <p> A resounding " NO!!!! " to organ meats. I remember, I was eight years old, my sister was six. We spent the night with an " elderly " aunt.( She was probably all of 55 years old!) She was excited about a kidney pie she made. My sister and I looked at each other. Suddenly, my sister said, " We 're little girls! We ca n't eat that. " She saved the day, and we had peanut butter sandwiches!!! When it was my turn to cook dinner, and dinner was liver. I would cry, and cry, and cry until my Mother said I could have a PBJ. Ca n't stand liver( an organ meat). The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes, but not all " disgusting " foods are meats. Some people have mentioned the durian fruit as disgusting for a lot of people. I 've never seen or tasted it, but it does n't sound like I 'd like it much. Also, I hated tomatoes growing up because the grossed me out. There has to be other fruits and veggies that people find hard to eat! <p> I do n't have a problem with animal hearts. The heart of any mammal is just a muscle. Chicken hearts are good, for instance. Brains? No. Fry one in your own kitchen and you 'll hear the neighbors gagging in theirs. <p> I 'm 54 years old, so old enough to know better than to shovel filth into my mouth. For about the last 20 years I 've maliciously defined the " sophisticated palate " as a silly willingness to eat garbage. That 's my truth. <p> Caviar is fine, in my book, but not snails. Too dangerous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that stuff. On a side note, once in my early twenties my drunk room mates and I decided to pick the snails off the sidewalk when it was raining once and boiled them. Bad idea. Had to toss the pan, though we did try at least one each. lol <p> I remember my grandmother standing at the stove stirring a huge pot of blood to make blood sausage. Between the goulish look of it, and the stench, I had to pass...... Raw octopus in Greece was " tasty " but to rubbery to chew. I could n't get it down. Other things I just ca n't get past.... tongue, brains, kidney pie, insects, snake, eyeballs, and tripe. UGH... wierd though, coz I 'll eat things like eel, frog legs, and raw oysters withouth question!! <p> Rice birds in China. Basically stir-fried whole baby birds without feathers. The heads crunched like a pork rind and the legs and feet were like small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!! <p> I had " shirako " in Japan, and I thought it was fish brains. After I looked up shirako in a dictionary, I was disappointed to find out that it meant " fish sperm or sperm-producing organ. " After that, I wished it had been brains. It did n't taste bad, though. It 's just the association that got me. <p> After re reading the little chain here I realize my bf quip is a bit of a non sequitur. Apologies. I was sort of going random and free associating which probably tells WAY too much about my warped mind....( sigh...) <p> My husband, who is an adventurous eater, while traveling in Korea was served thinly sliced pig snout wrapped in lettuce leaves. He 's eaten live baby octopus, any number of feet of various animals, all sorts of innards, but he returned to his hotel and ordered a hamburger after that experience. <p> My wife is Taiwanese and the food that separates the Taiwanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ". You can smell it from 100 yards away. At every Taiwanese fair there is a line up an hour long to buy the stuff! <p> I 'd eat anything as long as it 's good and will not kill me and if the animal is not in the endangered list. I 've travelled to other countries and I always make a point to try what the locals eat. You 'd be amazed at how those things look yucky but they 're actually benign and most of them really taste good. Balut( duck egg) and dinuguan( pork blood stew) in the Philippines, camel stew in the Middle East ; frog legs, century eggs and cow brain in China, puffer fish in Tokyo ; goat innards in Guatemala and PB &J; in Baltimore <p> Andrew Zimmern and his terrible show promotes cruel exotic eating for entertainment. His show had the beating frog heart. There is simply no reason to eat like that. Poor people do n't do horrible things to animals because they think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts. Big difference. <p> If I recall that show, it was a shop that sells " medicinal " foods. In some parts of the world, you eat the " still alive " creature in order to take in its strength. In places like Japan, you can eat still living fish. In some places in India( if I remember correctly), you can order fresh monkey brains. Mildly put, it 's called a " food chain. " It 's the reason I do n't go in the ocean, and I do n't wander the Serengeti ; eat or be eaten. Darwinism at its best! <p> Indians are mostly vegetarian doubt they eat monkey brains. Eating food for anything other than hunger and nutrition is not part of the " food chain ". People are doing ti for entertainment and that 's weird. <p> Are hamburgers really that fattening when you make them using lean meat and fresh toppings? But I 'm sure there are plenty of people that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how lean... <p> what the hell is so wrong with hamburgers? Its ground up steak and nothing more, most commonly chuck for its fat content. Do you have ANY idea what it is you eat? Its shocking that you do nt even know how a hamburger is made. <p> Hotdogs &; haggis? That 's the best you can do? Check out any night market in China or Taiwan for infinitely stranger stuff... Really, these are all items that stem from a history of starvation &; having nothing left to eat but bugs, entrails &; garbage that was already starting to rot. Why on earth does anybody continue to eat these when there 's fresh food available? <p> Andrew Zimmern( of Bizarre Food fame) makes the point that innards of animals are eaten all over the world because animal protein is simply too valuable and rare to waste. Most of the world can not afford to eat the way we do in the West. They are shocked and distressed at how much food we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is enough for them to live on completely... and they would be grateful for it all. <p> The most likely source of protein for the starving( and almost) starving world are insects. In fact, many societies routinely include them on the table. They are high in protein, plentiful, easy to prepare and when combined with other recipes can be delicious. <p> Until or unless you have gone for weeks or months without( adequate) calories, you simply can not understand what it is to starve. And when you do, almost any form of protein looks delicious, including bugs. We all eat plenty of bugs( which occur naturally) in our foods, but just do n't know about it. " Disgusting " food is no such thing if and when you are starving, count on it. <p> We only find some foods " disgusting " because we are so very well fed. We are ghastly spoiled, myself included. <p> Well said. I recently received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one week. The Americans pictured only consumed highly processed foods and a lot of it. To me that is disgusting. <p> Most of the disgusting foods come from areas of the world where nothing went to waste. They did nt have the choice of " good food ", you did nt eat what you had you went hungry. Makes one thankful for what you have now. <p> Oh you guys are so dumb. Pigs feet stew is dilicious and its the main ingrediant in making Jello. Although its from cows feet. The most unapitizing is the embyo eggs that the filipinos bury in the ground and it it so many days later. Although a friend of mine tasted it in a do or dare and said it was delicious and tasted like chicken soup. <p> There 's exotic foods that are just sick and cruel that first world people eat for entertainment like the beating heart of a frog and twisted stuff like that. Then there 's third world people who use every inch of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything? My family in another country used the nuts of a male sheep for soup. <p> my aunt always loved to chew on the chicken feet, after they were cleaned and cooked of course, i prefered to pull on the tendon to see how the toes worked.i 've eaten pickled pigs feet when i was a kid, but would'nt now.my dad used to fix beef kidneys and fava beans for he and i,( not my mother though she would leave the kitchen,, dad said " you boil once, throw that water away, then boil again, in other words you boil the p... out of them, dredge in flour, lots of pepper, and fry ' em up, delicious, would'nt eat those either, but if my father was alive i 'd like nothing better. <p> All the usual suspects are " gross ", i.e. cheese full of squirming maggots, brains scooped out of a living trepanned monkey, etc., but for me, the simple Hot Pocket will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arizona, my parents were shopping at a local grocer and found, next to the ground beef, whole and ground sheep dicks and nuts, packaged sealed and priced. Needless to say, this was passed up. Something I did try, however, and would love to again came from Thailand. It looked like a Rice Krispies Treat, but instead of rice cereal and marshmallow fluff, it was tiny little fish and very thick honey of some sort. It was brought to me by a teacher in high school who went to Thailand on vacation. I ca n't remember what it was called, but it tasted awesome and I would love to try it again. Can anyone help me out on this? What is it, and where can I get it? <p> Yuck.. that 's gross. I am vegetarian by choice and it is hard to believe why would we have such an article on CNN. With that I mean, an article which is an emblem of inhumanity. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one of us. <p> With the exception of plants( though a few of them too), all living things eat other living things. It 's nature. Accept, better still embrace, your natural place in it. We evolved as hunter-gatherers for millions of years, and that is our basic human nature. <p> I respect the principal of not eating meat because you 're eating something that once lived. I do n't share the opinion, but I respect it. <p> However, eating meat is n't inhuman, its actually very, very human. So, it would be more of an emblem of humanity than one of inhumanity. <p> One of the great parts about living in highly developed countries in the modern world is that it offers us the luxury of choosing what we eat based on principals and tastes. I think it 's great that you believe so strongly about animal rights, but I just do n't agree that eating meat is inhumane. <p> I have read and laughed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trully amazed at some of your bravery. Let me describe my expereince with the only food I coud not force myself to try. On a trip to Taiwan I learned about a local delecay called " Stinkey Tofu. " It is reported to smell bad, but taste great kind of like a strong smelling cheese. With the bravery of a fool I made my way to downtown Taipai to locate a " Stinkey Tofu " stand. On my way there I commented to my friend that I thoght he had stepped in some kind of animal droppings because he smelled like... well.... discarded defication. Upon checking each of our shoes we realized that my assumption was false. I then realized that we must be walking close to somekind of open sewage pipe because the smell had begun to a lack of a better word RAPE my naustrals. Upon voicing my distict displeasure our guide informed that I was a silly tourist and I was actually enjoying the sweet aroma of a stinkey food stand located some 30 meters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every meter brought my nausia to new hights. At last I admited defeat and fled behind a dumpster to vomit in bitter agony. In the next few minutes i stood recovering and for the first time trully enjoying the smell of rotting garbage over that of food. I bow to those tourists who have braved this food. Bravo Bravo <p> I 'm Taiwanese so have definitely had stinky tofu. Sorry you had such a bad experience with it! I definitely can attest to some having ridiculously putrid smells but that 's probably more of a function of the vendor you were approaching not using quality ingredients and probably was cooking it in very old/dirty oil. Really good stinky tofu has a nice pungent, but not totally unpleasant smell to it.( analogous to old cheese, like you said). It 's usually served with some pickled cabbage and carrots so the acidity cuts away some of the smell. usually served with some sort of soy sauce and hot chili paste. I hope you give it another go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed bread/potato filling, beef liver, chicken livers, the unborn egg yolk found in a chicken, dandelion greens from your yard with cooked bacon dressing( yuk), and tripe,. I grew up in a PA Dutch home in Pennsylvania. My grandmother was a frugal woman and the time was during WWll. We also ate pretzel soup-a cream based soap with butter and pretzels floating in it.( we lived near a pretzel factory). We also ate with the seasons, grew herbs in a cold frame in our yard. If you ate some of the odd stuff you then got to eat the homemade cinnamon buns, homemade bread, homemade cookies, cakes, pies, homemade puddings, Home preserved sauerkraut. Fruit that was canned for the winter, The grown ups drank raw milk and raw oysters, the kids had pasterized milk and cooked oysters. We had fish of all kinds always served on Fridays because that is when the fish in the local fish market was freshest. Nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did see homemade acrapple and mush( sliced and fried with syrup) -(blech). Then there was the " squab " dinner. During WWll we had a boarder and he like to hunt. One day he brought a whole bunch of small birds home for our dinner. They were cleaned and cooked. I was very young so I asked what they were. My grandmother said -- Squab! Turned out the Squab was Pigeon. My grandmother also had a way to deal with " picky " eaters. You sat at the table until you ate all of it. If you were consistantly well behaved at dinner she would take you on the train to Philadelphia to the Crystal Tearoom at Wanamakers. Afterwards she would buy some Limburger Cheese and we would go home. One winter day she bought the Limburger Cheese, we got on the train, she put her packages on the floor next to the heater. Suddenly the entire train car smelled like the dreaded Limburger. It was a day to remember because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phila. <p> I think the weirdest thing I have ever eaten was an oven-baked guinea pig( call cui). It 's a delicacy in Peru, and I was really curious to try it, and it actually turned out to not be that bad. It sort of tasted like grilled and marinated chicken. <p> I 'm american. Now go eat some good old fashioned animal " byproducts ". LOL and before you thumb your noses at pigs feet and the like take a look at your own backyard and the antibiotic sucking, mutated, tortured, disgusting looking livestock you call meat! Anyone up for TACO BELL? LOL Silly... i mean, dumb rednecks! <p> Haggis is fantastic. If you like pate, give it a whirl. I lived in Redmond, WA for three years, and had the luck of living next to two very asian stores. There were " delicacies " like Duck Heads, Pig Uterus, and Chicken Feet available by the pound, and that 's just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, by the way, are delicious) was easily one of the most traumatizing cooking experiences I 've had. Try clipping the first knuckle off of four toes 50 or 60 times, and tell me it 's not. <p> I 'm half filipino so you can imagine some of the things I 've seen. The worst is what is called ' chick-chick ' - one day old chick cooked in a fire on a skewer from what I was told. Never had it but it sounds not only gross but kind of cruel as well. Balut( chick/duck egg embryo) i 've actually had and was pretty bad - had to wash it down with a 24oz beer. <p> It 's ridiculous that so many people include haggis with " bizarre " or gross foods. It 's a pudding-style sausage - that 's all. There is nothing in it that would n't turn up in most other sausages. I do n't eat meat now, but I used to, and I ate haggis and found it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mason has a wonderful one. <p> Liver is the only organ meat I like to eat. The rest just does n't taste or smell good to me -- so in answer to the little survey I have to go with a plop of Stouffers Mac &; Cheese. Having said that -- I 've always thought Zimmern would be a great guy to go on vacation with. I love to sample different food -- the only place I have to draw the line is at worms and larvae. I 'm sure I 've ingested a few in my life -- most of us have -- but knowingly? Uh-uh. I KNOW I 'd starve to death first. That maggot cheese they eat in Italy -- people even have preferences about it. Some like the maggots alive, some prefer them dead. I 've heard eating live maggots can actually be dangerous to ones health on the off chance it survives stomach acids, or gets hung up along the way down. I also would avoid vcertain foods on principle -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asians eat for " medicinal " reasons. <p> We eat things that are n't even really " food " even if our stomachs can still digest it, but we think that 's not disgusting because it " looks good ". The universal perspective of the world is " we fear what we do n't understand ". <p> I suppose if you really want to be disgusting you can eat roasted pig penis with a side of mountain oysters... but now that you know that I find that disgusting, you also know why Bill was able to be tempted by Monica. <p> So me people do feed dogs and cats, natural carnivores, vegetarian or even vegan diets, which I consider animal abuse. Dogs can survive without meat though it 's far from their optimum diet, but " vegan " cats must be supplemented with taurine, which is only found naturally in animal products. That should be a clue that they should be eating meat. No top performance dogs that I 'm aware of are not fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " disgusting " foods are extremely nutrient-dense and will therefore bestow superior health benefits almost unheard of by westerners. Such is the sad state of our modern food culture, which is overtaken by government guidelines and corporate food products. I discuss nutrition and the politics of food in my blog, http : //www.nationalfork.com. I 'd love for anyone interested to check it out. <p> I do nt think of any food as particularly disgusting as long as its not bad for you. I cant stand greasy, fatty, vinegary, or salty foods. It just tastes bad. And do nt spice up my steak till I cant taste the steak. When I order steak I want it to taste like steak not spices and not sauces. And if you think a dish needs salt just put a shaker on the table and Ill handle it. <p> Baloot( sp?) -- Fertilized chicken eggs, " fermented " while buried in the ground until " developed "( just a little) -- could n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the bones crunching when others ate them -- then had to pick the feathers out of their teeth. I stuck to the pigs feet. <p> If you 're not familiar with natto, it is sticky fermented soybeans found in Japan. I lived in Japan for a year, and wanted to try natto when I first arrived. I knew about it before I went, but I wanted to try it anyway. Many of my foreigner friends were disgusted by it, particularly disgusted by the smell and texture, but I thought it was SO GOOD. <p> It is traditionally served on top of steamed rice, and is mixed with a raw egg and sliced green onions. A flavored soy sauce and a spicy mustard packet, which are included in each packaged serving of natto, are also combined in the raw egg and onion mixture. This ' dish ', if you will, is typically eaten at breakfast. And as a side note, because soybeans are a staple in Japan, natto is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as it is rich in protein. <p> Natto has been likened to many types of putrid smells and horrible tastes and textures. Even how it looks has been described in the most foul of ways. But TO ME, it just smells of cold, day-old black coffee, and how it looks and tastes does n't bother me in the least bit. In fact, when natto is mixed with everything I described above( and in my opinion, it 's how it really should be eaten), it tastes that much more delicious. <p> So if you ever go to Japan, or are feeling adventurous while browsing through your local Asian supermarket, give natto a try. You 'll like it a lot more than you think. <p> Feet. It smells like dirty feet. I 've had it, and it does n't taste as bad as it smells. But anything strong-smelling before noon makes me heave. I 've never understood the old-school British thing of having kidneys for breakfast. Ureic acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If it is food and wo n't kill me, then I will usually have a taste. I find some pretty ordinary foods disgusting. I ca n't stand pimento cheese, sweet pickles, or celery for instance. <p> When I was in college they served something we called " surprise in a bowl. " If it was served with rice, it was " Chinese surprise in a bowl. Whatever it was, it looked. smelled, and tasted vile. On the other hand, it did usually provide some hysterically funny conversations about what was actually in it on the way out for pizza or burgers. <p> Sadly, they 're still serving it -- complete with same name and same reactions by the students. <p> I have n't met many foods I would n't eat at least once. If trotters are good enough for Joel Robuchon, they are good enough for me. I 'll have a big bowl of pho complete with chicken tendons and tripe before I 'll have a chicken " finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death! And of course, I ca n't refuse boudin noir. <p> Kind of funny how the mental side hangs people up. Had some mountain lion meat a while back, diced some back strap up as a tooth pick appetizer for my daughters b-day party, 2 out of 20 or so adults tried it, the little girls ate all of it after that, defintely a mind set more than taste issue. For those that have n't tried cat, it is nothing more than lean pork in taste and consistency, good stuff. <p> In 1989 my grandmother &I; cleaned out her freezer. We found a package of lutefisk dated " 1969 ". We decided to cook it up. It tasted as good as... fresh stuff. Of course, we also raised &; killed our own chickens, cattle &; pigs so a little 20-yr-old lye-soaked fish was n't going to put us off. : -) <p> Au Contrare. After hearing what goes into haggis, I 'll not seek it out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me and tell me to try it, I probably will. Same with rabbit. Do n't tell me what it is ahead of time. Ignorance is bliss. <p> I was treated to a so-called delicacy some years ago by a friend( or so I thought). It was called Ludafisk and, as it was explained, has it 's origins with the Swedes and other Nordic tribes that immigrated to North America over the many years. Plainly put, ludafisk is a kind of putrified or pickled fish. Do n't really know and do n't really care. All I know is that when I got it within a couple of inches of my nose, all bets were off. I hurled all of the beer that I had drank that evening and would n't revisit that moment in my life for anything. <p> lutefisk is Scandinavian and translates to lye-fish. it 's just air dried cod with lots of salt to preserve it. not all the different than how you would preserve pork and call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no chance with Icelandic HAkarl which is shark meat fermented( rotted) in a hole in the sand :) <p> Even so, I have to be in a mood to eat eggs, and I have to temporarily forget that I 'm eating something that came out of a chicken 's hoo-hoo. Plus, the egg industry( i.e., factory farms) are really cruel to chickens -- probably one of the most animal-abusive industries on the planet. <p> So long as the quality and cleanliness of the meat is okay, I 'm good. I care absolutely nothing about the " feelings " or " comfort " of the chickens at a factory farm. Maybe in mamby pamby land, where everyone eats marshmallows and clouds, chickens live in chicken heaven. I am a CARNIVORE. That 's my food and if I 'm hungry, its time on this earth is over -- however that needs to happen. <p> I 'm the same way with eggs.... I have to be in the mood to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs.... which we always called " dippy " eggs b/c you would be able to dip your toast in the warm gooey yolk. YUM! <p> Wow! Balut -- only when I was a kid, and only in a dark closet. Dog and lizard taste like chicken. Btw, was n't there a CNN article about hotdogs having the least amount of carcinogenic toxins compared to some meats and chicken( with and without skin)? <p> I ate Balut in the Philippines. It is not so much the taste, as the texture that is bothersome. We were in a VERY dark bar and they shoved some at me. I could n't see it, but I had heard about it, and when I put it in my mouth, I knew exactly what it was! Not too bad, at all -- but you can not THINK about it! <p> Growing up in Alaska allowed me the chance to fish A LOT. I really like chicken hearts and gizzards for some reason, always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutting one a certain afternoon. <p> In Korea the ones I got from the " street vendors " /small sidewalk restaurants( yes, they were gizzards -- I could tell, lol) were really salty and fried. I like mine boiled until about done, then sauteed in cheap brown gravy. MMMMmmmm. <p> And they 're only about $1.50 or so for a package of around a pound or so, if I recall. <p> A hot dog is so processed into homogeniety, that it could be anything. Slice open a hot dog -- it 's got the consistency and look of pink tofu. And hot dogs are essentially salted meat flavor. Disgusting? To a Vegan, maybe. A hot dog is world 's apart from eating larvae or brains or offal -- which a hot dog could well conceal, but no one can tell. <p> I 've been inside several meatpacking plants as part of my job, and I 've seen what goes into hot dogs. It 's really not disgusting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too small to become a steak, filet, etc. I 'm talking about meat from the skull, jowls, legs, back, etc. It 's no different than the meat in your burger or pork chop. It 's just small and shaped different, so they process it into hot dogs. The horror stories people tell about hooves and eyes going into hot dogs are relics from the 19th Century and early 20th. That stuff all went away when Upton Sinclair wrote " The Jungle ". <p> The same color it is raw? There is no dye in hot dogs, at least not the pure beef ones that are meant for consumption by humans. Not sure whats in a Ball Park or Oscar Meyer hot dog as those are too disgusting to eat. <p> Theres nothing strange about a 100% beef hot dog, they use normal large cuts of beef and then emulsify it which is what gives it its smooth texture. Hot dogs are not made of scraps, hair, or rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra emulsification process. <p> mikewoodhall, that is definitely true in this day and age. however, I think your father spoke in the context of the the gore of butchering, whereas what really makes his statement true is if we could only see how much chemicals and processed filler go into our foods. <p> I actually love natto! Some Japanese restaurants will offer natto rolls, and waiters have actually discouraged me from ordering them, I guess because I 'm not from their culture. When I tell them I like natto and order it regularly, they 're shocked. I do n't see why it would make a disgusting list, but each to his or her own. <p> Here in my area of the country, we have livermush! Despite the name, it 's actually wonderful! Enough to warrant an annual festival in its honor in Shelby, NC. It consists of pig liver( and verious other parts) ground up to a very fine consistency, then mixed with corn meal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilled, and sold in blocks at the store. It can be deep fried, pan fried( my favorite), or even baked( but if you bake livermush around here, you 're likely to be verbally berated). <p> A group from my hometown went to a camp in Wisconsin and brought 2 lbs of livermush with us. Calling it " southern sausage "( which is n't far off!), we served it on the day we had KP. It was a hit and has been requested every year since. It does n't look spectacular, and the name, in modern days, turns most heads from it, but it tastes phenominal! <p> High five! I 'm married to a Tarheel and in his neck of the woods, it 's Liver Pudding. Slightly differently spiced, but MAN is that good eating. I bring it home from North Carolina every year at Christmas. <p> My mother LOVES scrapple!! I was born in PA and lived there until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make myself eat scrapple! I remember my mom ordering scrapple at the diner all the time. I usually settled for chipped beef! <p> Like Blah, I am not a Scot, but traveled in Scotland when stationed in the UK and ordered Haggis several times in back-country Scottish pubs. I LIKE IT. I do, however believe the bravest person in the world was the first person in history to eat cheese. I read once that cheese was likely discovered on a schlep through the desert with milk carried in a bag made from a sheep 's stomach. The combination of heat, the motion of the animal bearing the bag and pectin left over in the animal stomach bag made the milk congeal into cheese -- must have been delicious! <p> Haggis sounds unpleasant but when I saw it prepared and eaten on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern I was like, " Oh, okay, I 'd eat that! " I just did n't know how it was prepared -- it 's basically just like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can eat a hot dog, you can probably eat haggis is my guess. <p> This may be sad to say but I love Haggis, have it for breakfast and dinner( with tatties and nips). Ate blook pudding on recent cruise every morning, steak &; kidney pie is excellent. Just keep the asparagus away from me. <p> I hate liver in all its forms. I have tried to eat lungs and beefheart as well. Yuck! Nevertheless, when it 's all put together with a wee bit of onion and some oats in a wee sheep 's stomach, it 's delightful. Haggis with neeps and tatties make a feast fit for a king( i.e., a king who does n't care what his cholesterol level is). <p> The worst thing about all this is when you realize that every one of those foods is somebody 's favorite. Plus it 's popular enough to be sustained by a culture and in some cases popular for thousands of years. <p> I 've prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hocks( wrists), as they have some meat on them, but the fat flavors pasta sauce beautifully. I 've had cows hoof broth, but am unable to digest it, since my gallbladder was removed. My grandmother, an off the boat from Sicily woman, ate the chicken 's feet and nibbled what meat was on the head. I 've used the duck 's head, feet and neck to flavor duck soup. I 'm completely unable to digest brain, do n't know if it 's the fat level or what, but it sits like lead in my stomach and does n't feel very good. I HAVE wanted to try haggis, just to see what the taste and texture is like, though I suspect I 'll not like it, due to the offal present( SOME offal and I rather disagree with each other). But, I 've also gone hungry for an extended period. So, I find NO food disgusting, I may not care for the taste, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, again, disgusting, no. Still, to each his or her own. I currently eat in 27 languages. I 've brought spices home from the middle east, where I was deployed for nearly 5 years and introduced my neighbors to new flavors. Now, I have a friend in Saudi send my packs of spices I can not get here OR are crazy too expensive here. Expand your horizons! The worst case scenario is that it 'll taste like old sweatsocks, the best case scenario, you 'll find a new dish you will love. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to stir the pasta sauce, with pork hocks and ox tails. And yes, I HAVE made that work. <p> I used to be an adventurous eater when I was a kid. Brain, tongue, snail, eel, frog legs, turtle eggs, bugs... Oxtail was amazing. My grandma was the best cook in the universe that could make anything like that smelled and tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I could n't get myself to gnaw on chicken feet. My sister loved it, but it was too rubbery for my taste. <p> Now, I think I 'll be sick just thinking about eating those things. Ca n't believe I had turtle eggs... now they 're endangered... sigh. <p> It 's refreshing and smile-forming to know that a sense of adventure is still had by some people. I agree with you, Wzrd1 ; expand your horizons. I do n't much think I 'd like the taste of sweat socks but, by at least trying a food, I can say with honesty and conviction that I do n't like it. <p> I quite agree with you. I routinely use sweetbreads, natto, seaweed, octopus, chicken feet, beef bones and other good things. There 's a lot more out there that is good than fried chicken and hamburgers. <p> The truth of the matter is, dishes such a haggus, kidney pie, etc came out of need, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scraps left over from the butcher-things the upper class threw away. They found creative ways to feed hungry children with it. Many of these dishes have become the staples of working class families. In England, bread pudding was served before the meal, so that bellies would be so full, they would n't eat as much meat. <p> I had a really big family so we ate what money could buy, all the ingredients for soul food. Ham hocks with greens or beans, neck bones &; cabbage, oxtail stew, turkey necks &; rice, pig?? s feet, ears, snout and chitterlings and of course every part of the yard bird. The only part of a cow I knew was the tongue, and stomach( tripe). Cooked for hours until it melted in your mouth. <p> Actually the REAL truth is that most dishes involving offal substantially predate the very recent culinary development of not using the whole animal. Socio-economic status has always, and still does, have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not invented on the leavings of an upper class, they were a way of not wasting anything in a primitive society where every resource had to be maximized. <p> Actually, you have it backwards. Wealth allowed us to become finicky and pick and choose the bits of the plants and animals we want to eat. The wealthier a society gets, the more limited its diet becomes. That is actually to our disadvantage because we 've stopped eating a lot of good things. <p> The most disgusting food out there is SHMEAT in all its forms. That 's not just because of how it looks on the plate - but how it got there. If you du n no what that is, check out NOSHMEAT.COM - the ' most popular ' article there. <p> SHMEAT is a pile of disinformation and half-truths designed to ignite people 's emotions. It is completely without credibility because of the agendas of the people behind it. Ignore the nutters and stick to the real science. <p> Hey now.... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration towards the militant &; in-your-face V-dieters, not all of us tree-huggers ' are vegan or veggie-tarians. Some of us huggers are omnivores, too. <p> Marshmallows. Throw pig hooves into a pot of boiling water. Wait for the scum to rise. Scoop off the scum and use it as the gelatin base for marshmallows. Marhsmallows and Jello are nothing more than flavored gelatinous pig toe jam.( or
