That is almost like asking me to pick out which two of my children were to appear in a " best of the family " household anthology. In fact, it is exactly like that because. although like most writers I try to maintain a pose of public professionalism, also like most writers I bleed and die with every story I write. <p> So when Ballantine books suggested that someone else make the selections for me, I was ecstatic with relief.
