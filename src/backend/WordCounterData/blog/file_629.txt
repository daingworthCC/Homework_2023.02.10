5171341 <h> What it is NOT <p> Sometimes in order to find out what something IS it helps to recognize what it is not. <p> I 'm exploring the idea of rest this month. When we think of it I 'm pretty sure that for some of us it includes a spa pedicure, or a walk on the beach. Maybe it means your husband taking your toddler to the park so you can nap for 30 minutes or maybe it means knitting and watching Downton Abbey. Rest for you might mean tea with a friend or a book by a campfire. <p> These things suggest rest to us, perhaps, but we all know that rest is different for each person. <p> I 'm learning what rest is not. <p> It is not the absence of activity. I believe wholeheartedly that we can be actively doing something and be at rest. <p> I also know that rest is not the opposite of energy. Sometimes in order to rest, it takes a lot of energy. Rest for me sometimes means expending energy and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest is also not the opposite of work. There are times when my body is at rest and even my mind, but my heart is hard at work. Maybe even God is working, others are working or I 'm working in order to be at rest. Work is n't necessarily contrarian to rest. <p> Just observe two children : one who loves to read and one who does not. This is my family, for the record. For the lover of books, reading is an escape and for her it is sweet joy without a shred of work in it. For the daughter who does not enjoy it, every word is scraped preciously and piled up as work done with much effort. <p> I believe that the opposite of rest is worry. It is anxiety. <p> Think hard : it 's why it takes us 3 days to begin to feel like we are on vacation when we leave for a trip. And its why for many of us vacation is n't really rest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home. <p> Anxiety steals our quiet. It steals the softness of soul and takes away our ability to close our eyes to the world and simply be with our own selves and with the God who made us. <p> I 'm going to tell you a secret : <p> Up until about six months ago, I used to wake up in the middle of the night several times a month with intense anxiety. Everything I had n't done during the day previous, everything that was waiting for me tomorrow and everything in between crept up at 2 am and stayed with me for hours. Praying sometimes helped but did n't cure it. <p> It happened often and the next day I 'd walk around worried and exhausted from the night before. <p> I know now that God was with me in the worry, but was teaching me something. He did n't teach me how to manage it, but how to give it away. He did n't take the anxiety from me but stayed with me while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how I began doing this, but when I would wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning and fully expected a night full of tossing, turning and anxiety, I began to picture in my mind a warm and cozy cottage near some mountains. In my mind 's cottage, I began to scoop up all the things that were bothering me, actually picturing myself picking up people that had hurt me or things I had to do or fix. Once I had hoisted these things one-by-one, I might add on to my back, I walked to the front door of the cottage and looked out. <p> Outside the front of the cottage was a friendly little stream that ran down a hill. I gently placed these things that gave me worry into the stream and watched as they floated away. <p> And then I did it all over again. The first time I did it, it took me awhile, but eventually I fell asleep. <p> Maybe you think it 's silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage filled with woodsmoke and braided rugs, but after having done this nearly physical releasing of my worries, the nighttime worry is almost non-existent and whenever I begin to feel it again, I know exactly where to go and what to do. <p> I know this is n't a cure for true anxiety disorders( and would never suggest that), but for me, the worry that I was keeping inside all day? God came to me at night and showed me how to let it go. <p> I still am not quite sure I have a grasp on what rest is, but I know what it is not. <p> What do you think? Are you a worrier? Does it keep you from truly resting? How do you " give away " your worry? <h> Comments <p> It amazes me... in the night how the enemy comes and brings fear... and things that would not have bothered me during the day... or things I could think through more rationally in the day... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be racing before I could even recognize what was happening... now most times I can feel it and like you calm my spirit by laying each one down... giving each one to Jesus and actively choosing to entrust them to His loving care. I love the picture of placing those burdens in a stream... very peaceful thought. I hope you back is doing better.... happy rest <p> Ironically, I started having anxiety attacks, when I was hired to be on staff at our old church. I had panic attacks, weekly, for my entire seven years working there. I fooled myself into thinking that it was the price you pay, doing God 's work and it was because I cared so very much about what I was doing. When I quit, the panic attacks stopped, even though I had an infant and less sleep. Three years later, they began again and it was in conjunction to hosting a large " Christian " event and continued for about a year. They have stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always bed fellows with my lack of peace and reliance on the Lord. Where there is no peace and rest, there is no sleep at least for me. <p> Of all the " 31 days " series, I am so grateful for yours! Looking forward to the month of wisdom! <p> Why is it that my body sometimes literally ACHES for rest, yet if I dare to put my feet up or try to enjoy some " down time " my mind begins to make me feel guilty? It takes such conscious effort to turn my brain off and to allow myself to rest without feeling like there is something around the house that I need to be( SHOULD be) doing. If only women had the ability to compartmentalize like men do, huh? <p> Sarah, I have been a worrier ever since I was a little girl, and after my dad died of cancer at the age of 52 over 13 years ago, my worrying has increased exponentially. I have been suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early morning hours are the worst. I have been keeping a gratitude journal and it is helping a bit, and I read 50 scriptures on what God says about worrying before bed. I am praying that I can feel His peace and comfort and learn to release all my worries into His care, and I pray for anyone else who suffers with anxiety as well. <p> i deal with anxiety -- both the kind that you are describing and the kind that requires medication. neither are easy. when my anxiety stems from a lack of faith/trust in God I 've found all I can do is ask Jesus to intercede for me. For him to take the worries that are consuming my heart and turn them into a beautiful petition to the Father on my behalf. <p> i 'm so sorry Brooke! I love it how you 've seen Jesus as the true Advocate for us, taking our petitions to the Father. I 've never experienced the kind of anxiety that requires medication. Thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story. <p> Thank you for these thoughts.... I tend to think anxiety comes from hurry AND worry. They seem to walk hand in hand! When I turn it all off and begin to worship Jesus for who He is, amazingly I sense the rest and peace begin to settle over me. Lovely post, Sarah! <h> Looking for something? <h> Hope is the thing with feathers <p> " Fairy Tales are more than true ; not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. " -- GK Chesterton It never really does end happily ever after. At least not for middle-life-me : kids in school, husband working long hours, me tumbling into bed late at night in... <p> I 'm a happy part of the jumbly-reorganization of the storytellers over at a Deeper Story. Did you know we added two more channels? We added A Deeper Church and A Deeper Family to the collection of story-givers over there to make three amazing places to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... <p> " Hope " is the thing with feathers -- That perches in the soul -- And sings the tune without the words -- And never stops -- at all --... It was Emily Dickinson who made hope out to be a little bird, singing proudly and sweetly in
