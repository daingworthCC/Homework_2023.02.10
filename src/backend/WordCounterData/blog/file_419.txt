5150141 <h> 49. Nikki Beach, Miami, United States <p> Reservations and good-lookers only. This cool club with a rep for its strict door policy -- be irresistibly beautiful or do n't turn up without a reservation - -- did n't invent the beach bar, but it did reinvent the genre for a generation who may never have felt the sand between their manicured toes. <p> St. Trop-style chill joint by day, with raised " opium beds " and linen-covered loungers, it turns into an alfresco nightclub after dark, when international DJs man the decks at weekends. <p> There are now Nikkis from Koh Samui to Cabo San Lucas -- not to mention the desert resorts of Las Vegas and Marrakech, where Nikki has created a modern-day mirage. <h> 48. Tortilla Flats, Dominical, Costa Rica <p> The two-story establishment is located right on the sand in the laid-back surf town of Dominical. During the day, the crowds( mostly comprising dripping wet surfers) flock to Tortilla Flats for the surprisingly good food. <p> As the day winds down, you can grab a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in against the sunset. <h> 47. Pelican Bar, Jakes Treasure Beach, Jamaica <p> One drinking session you can never claim to have forgotten. When a place claims to have " the best cocktails in the sea " it 's easier to be cynical. But Pelican Bar really could have the best, because it really is in the sea. <p> Part of the Jakes Treasure Beach resort, the Pelican is built out on a shoal requiring a short boat ride for a visit. <p> No Internet, no TVs, no pool tables -- just thatched roof, seats and booze. No wonder it 's considered by fans to be the single best beach bar in the Caribbean. <h> 46. Purobeach, Mallorca, Spain <p> A beach bar for the aesthetically minded. If, upon setting foot in Mallorca 's Purobeach, you feel as if you 've stepped into a design magazine, you 're exactly right. The gorgeous beachfront property, run by Swedish entrepreneur Mats Wahlstrm, has been featured in countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity among the international jet set. <h> 45. Tamboo Tavern, Rincon, Puerto Rico <p> Sometimes beaches are better at night. Imagine a bar where you spend lunch time bathing on the sands and drinking pina coladas, the afternoons watching old black and white movies in a cozy corner and the evenings listening to live Latino music while humpback whales break the ocean surface in front of the glowing sun. <p> It 's not a dream -- this place exists on the idyllic coastline of Puerto Rico. It 's chilled out, but lively, it 's popular but roomy. If you 're planning a visit to the Caribbean, make sure you visit. <h> 44. Cary Arms, Babbacombe, England <p> It 's England ; the beach umbrellas are in case it rains. Now into its third summer as a posh people 's gastropub, the once-derelict Cary Arms is like a little glimpse of English heaven -- as long as the sun 's shining. <p> One part traditional British watering-hole with beamed ceiling and stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ale or Bays Gold among the specialty beers. <p> For the hungry there 's lobster and chips, the best crab sandwiches in Devon, all manner of gourmet fish dishes and the county 's famous Devon cream teas. Chill to a view of the coastline in one of the Adirondack chairs on the terrace, or move fast to grab a lunch table in the high-perched pergola known as the Captain 's Table. <h> 42. Nammos beach club, Bali, Indonesia <p> A private inclinator -- to get rid of those who ca n't walk home afterward. Kudos for effort -- this lively watering hole aims to recreate the ambiance of a Greek island, despite being based on a bamboo platform with a roof of indigenous grass. <p> The only access to its home on a tranquil turquoise lagoon fringed with white sand is via a private inclinator, which transports guests up and down 100 meters of sheer limestone cliff. <p> While the beach is the star by day( not to mention the waiters who dive into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order), by night the bar turns on the romance with Champagne and cold beer to lubricate the prawns and lobster. <h> 41. Tanjong Beach Club, Singapore <p> A gritty piece of fun. Who called this island sterile? This hideout on the sands does its best to recreate a relaxed beach attitude on the outskirts of the uptight city-state. <p> It came into existence thanks to a pair of not-so-uptight Aussie brothers who saw the sands of Sentosa as the perfect environment for seafood platters, tropical cocktails and good healthy fun like beach volleyball. <h> 40. Senor Frog 's, Acapulco, Mexico <p> Great -- if you do n't mind college kids and all-night parties. " Where anything can happen " is the motto of this utterly mad, love-it-or-hate-it, Spring Break vibe bar and restaurant overlooking the magnificent curve of Acapulco Bay -- and it really can. <p> Staff are primed to loosen visitors ' inhibitions - you could find yourself drinking Campari through a straw straight from the bottle, or dancing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me sideways steak " you 'll have to talk sideways to the waiter -- it 's not listed on the menu despite being a signature dish. <p> The town of Hvar where Hula Hula is located has an Ibiza-like party feel, but is considerably more low-key and friendly. <p> Located in West Hvar, a 15-minute walk from Hvar city center, open from June to September, Praia do Rei Costa da Caparica, Croatia, +351 967 777 424 <h> 37. Basil 's Bar, Mustique, The Grenadines <p> Let 's face it, a bar anywhere on this island would be better than most. Perhaps Mick Jagger comes for the lobster, perhaps he comes to get down with regular Joes -- Basil 's prides itself on being a place where " sailors party with business moguls, fashion models, gardeners, rock stars and schoolteachers. " <p> They open at 8 a.m. for banana pancake breakfasts and the place is still hopping late at night, when DJs and house bands join the party. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Extravagant and plush, but sometimes that 's OK. Guests of the St. Regis hotel have to climb out of their over-water villas and take a golf cart to the over-water Lagoon Bar. Non-guests are also welcome. <p> The restaurant and bar is suspended on stilts over the turquoise water so look down and you may catch a glimpse of dinner darting beneath your feet. <p> World renowned celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongetrichen offers a menu of local seafood with some European influence. <p> It 's one of the most extravagant beach stays on this list, with a hotel room running to US$1,000 a night. So save this one for the honeymoon. <h> 34. The Beach Bar, Asbury Park, United States <p> Shirts optional, but the white shades break all the rules. This ocean-side establishment does its best to bring the spirit of the tropics to the jam-packed conurbation of the northeastern United States. <p> Tempting offerings include strawberry mint " lemonade " underpinned with Absolute Citron and a cucumber lime gimlet. Tequila aficionados hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just US$5. <p> A new menu promised for this summer may yield expanded choices on the current, somewhat limited fare of chips with salsa, hummus with pita, shrimp cocktail and Mexican snacks. <h> 33. Little Ochie, Alligator Pond, Jamaica <p> These boats never sail, but that 's OK because you wo n't want to leave. Seafood and Red Stripe are the twin raisons d ' tres of this colorful and gloriously ramshackle operation on Jamaica 's south coast. <p> City dwellers drive for miles to eat jerked crab and other crustaceans in thatched boats on stilts as well as tables and chairs set out on the beach. <p> Reggae and Dance Hall blast from the jukebox, attracting the odd beachcombing mutt and roaming pig. <p> There 's beer aplenty, but do n't expect to find any alcohol in the signature Fish Tea -- it 's a fiery warmup broth to precede the likes of snapper simmered over pimento wood. <h> 32. Wreck Bar, Cayman Kai, Grand Cayman <p> The color scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hour from the tourist strip of Seven Mile Beach, whose visitors rarely make it out there unless they know about this place. <p> At the weekend it 's abuzz with regulars arriving by private boat, but on weekdays it regains a sense of placid nonchalance. <p> The thatched bar is a replica of one that first went up 60 years ago, when bartender " Old Judd " invented the frozen mudslide which became the national drink. Sip this heady mix of kahlua, vodka, Baileys and ice in a hammock strung between casuarina trees, and get up only to taste a really fine conch fritter, served with jerk mayo made to a secret recipe. <p> Rum Point, Cayman Kai, Grand Cayman <h> 31. The Star of Greece, Port Willunga, Australia <p> The coolest beach bars face Antarctica. For lunch on a sunny day, few places can match this colorful beach shack named for a nearby shipwreck in 1888. It 's attracted celebs from Kylie Minogue to Sting, yet displays no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Best of all, it 's on a beautiful broad stretch of clean, white sand which seems largely deserted, in spite of being fewer than 15 minutes from the vineyards of Maclaren Vale. <p> Expect divine gourmet dishes strewn with edible flowers as well as good fish and chips, top local wines and cold beer and cocktails. <h> 30. Bar de la Plage, Juan-les-Pins, France <p> You know life is good when your beach bar offers massages. In a happening little resort where every private beach has a bar, this new entry has injected a little chic into the genre. Even better than the sand within a toe 's reach are the private cabanas set out for spa treatments along the jetty. <p> Built on the site of the legendary but long-gone Maison des Pecheurs disco, it remains to be seen whether DJs will be hounded to create a St. Tropez-style vibe -- for now the sofas are there, and cool sounds emanate from a decent sound system. <h> 29. Da Conch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postcard perfect -- the only stamp you need is in your passport. With more seafood than you can stare at and more rum than you can throw up, Da Conch Shack in Provo, Turks and Caicos stakes a solid claim for the greatest beach bar in the British West Indies. <p> They 'll pull conch right out of the sea and slice it up for you there and then, they 'll keep pouring you rums till you beg them to stop and they 'll even serve a great grilled jerk chicken dish, if you overload on fresh seafood. <p> It 's unpretentious, fun, and casual, and for an island that 's not overrun with places to choose from, the prices are n't too stepp either. <h> 26. Ushuaia Beach Hotel, Ibiza, Spain <p> Ibiza -- the land of lounging ladies. The Ushuaia Beach Hotel has taken the beach bar residential. A combination of chic beach club, dance venue and stylish hotel, it aims to celebrate the heyday of outdoor Ibiza, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party scene. <p> Ushuaia lives up to the tradition by hosting some of the best parties on the island, with club nights both on the beach and around the pool. <h> 24. Margaritaville, Pensacola Beach, United States <p> It gave up trying to be cool -- and that 's when we fell in love with it. Love it or hate it, there 's no denying that this familiar chain bar is close to the heart of millions in America. We like Land Shark Landing, a pavilion that 's part of the Margaritaville Beach Hotel on Pensacola Beach. <p> A rotating menu of activities including beach-blanket movie nights, beach ping pong and volleyball on the sand. <p> A giant, fin-shaped fire pit, hammocks under palm trees and live band performances all contribute to the bar 's kitschy charm. <h> 23. Tabon Te Keekee, North Tarawa, Kiribati <p> A beach bar, but not as you know it. Whatever you thought you knew about beach bars, you better forget it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island in Kiribati, up to North Tarawa, cross the water in a traditional canoe( for US$1) and find yourself in Tabon Te Keekee. <p> Yes, it has the usual amazing ultra-marine water, the traditional Pacific kiakia stilt huts in the sea and more sun than you can lube up for. But you do n't know it 's even a bar till you 've fallen into a hammock and Karea, the half-English, half-I-Kiribati businessman saunters up and asks what you 're having. <p> If you 're drinking like the locals you 'll order a XXXX, but try the sour toddy made from coconut sap. It tastes awful, but packs a punch and if you ask Karea nicely he 'll probably give you some for free. <p> North of Tarawa island, cross the water and it 's the first stop in North Tarawa <h> 21. The Beach Club @ ME Cancun, Mexico <p> The only beach bar where you can dive from the pool to the sea. This South Beach-style high energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach via an amphitheatre of Bali-style day beds. <p> DJs mash it up on Fridays and Saturdays, while Chilled Strawberry Sundays provide a more soothing drop-in. You 'll never go thirsty as there 's a swim-up bar, a poolside bar, and a lounge open for drinks. <h> 20. ' C ' Beach Club, Mauritius <p> Extra points if you can find Domaine de Bel Ombre on a map. On the unspoiled south coast in Domaine de Bel Ombre, this is the first beach club on Mauritius. Taking some inspiration from Miami 's Nikki Beach and Bali 's KU DTA with cozy " love nests " and day beds, it also has a distinctively Mauritian feel. <p> A laid-back beach hangout by day with petanque and beach volleyball on offer, ' C ' Beach Club springs to life by night. Atmospheric blue lighting and a floodlit pool are the backdrop for parties hosted by international and local DJs. <h> 19. Bomba 's Shack, Tortola-Beach, British Virgin Islands <p> Looks even crazier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some to get turned off to Bomba 's Shack, with its signs imploring " Girls with big boops sic get naked for Bomba " and women 's underwear swinging from the ceiling. <p> But from its humble origins as a homely surfside shack, Bomba 's has become a renowned bar and party spot. <p> Made of driftwood, telephone poles and other mangled pieces of junk, this characterful bar is notorious for hosting epic Full Moon Parties and reeling in travelers from all around the world. <p> The crowd here is an eclectic mix of surfers, yachting tourists, and locals who might be sipping hallucinogenic tea, so Bomba 's is only for the open-minded. <h> 17. Flora-Bama Lounge, Florida, United States <p> Famed for mullets. Both kinds. Flora-Bama might be a total dive, but it has everything a beach bar needs. Live music. Wet T-shirt contests. Cold cheap beer, much loved by the solid mix of locals and out-of-towners. <p> If you 're feeling more refined, the crew will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> What makes Flora-Bama truly legendary, however, is the fact that it has hosted the annual Interstate Mullet Toss for 26 straight years. Flora-Bama straddles the state line of Florida and Alabama, and each April, thousands gather at the bar to party and watch intoxicated competitors throw slippery fish like a discus back and forth across the state line. <h> 16. Cafe Sofia Beach Bar, Cape Town, South Africa <p> Caf Sofia : Where " beach " is obviously more important than " bar. " Wedged between the hooting, honking city and the sweeping, sparkling ocean, Cafe Sofia Beach Bar in Cape Town manages to straddle the line between hectic party place and after-work chill spot. <p> The decor is warm and lounge-like ; the happy hour is generous ; the drinks are strong and plentiful ; the mezze and tapas platters are communal -- sit at the table, grab a fistful of calamari and discuss the best wave you ever rode with complete strangers. <p> This is a one of a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa -- but this, the flagship store, is staffed by the kind of people you wish you knew in " real life, " and therefore feels like one of a kind. <h> 15. Shalvata, Tel Aviv, Israel <p> A hop, skip and a long, but, eh, doable, jump from the Hamptons. Dubbed Manhattan-by-the-Med, Tel Aviv is lined with miles of white sandy beaches where locals and visitors party from April till October. The hub of nightlife is the regentrified Port area, and here there 's nowhere better than Shalvata to while the night away with sand between your toes. <p> Cocktails, cool sounds and low-slung sofas on the sands have made this the summer nightspot of choice for Israel 's beautiful people, but it 's also open for breakfast and does n't close till the last customer leaves. <h> 14. Bayside Beach Bar, Jalousie Plantation, St. Lucia <p> This is what you dream of when you dream of the Caribbean. The specialties here are mojitos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caribbean or right on the white sands of Sugar Beach. <h> 13. Cerritos Beach Club, Baja California, Mexico <p> There 's downtown Cabo, then there 's the rest of Baja. Family fun overlooking giant waves is what this laid-back club in a surfing town outside Cabo has to offer. A great indoor-outdoor bar serves classic cocktails and sipping tequilas with live jazz on Sundays. <p> There 's fresh seafood, an outdoor pool table, and no attempt to shut out 21st-century life -- plasma screens show the biggest matches simultaneously and the management lends guests laptops to check their email. <h> 11. Moonshadows, Malibu, United States <p> There are lots of beach bars on California 's Pacific Coast Highway, but only one Moonshadows. Although it now has a lot more competition than when it opened its doors 40 years ago, Moonshadows continues to score because no one else has quite such a dramatic outdoor bar perched right over the rocks and crashing surf along this stretch of Pacific Coast Highway. <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now pushes seafood, though carnivores will find Kobe burgers on the menu. <p> The Blue Lounge Bar is open seven days a week from before lunch to the small hours, though it may no longer serve the pina colada-ish Moonglow old hippies used to rock up for. <h> 10. Doyles on the Beach, Watsons Bay, Australia <p> World 's oldest beach bar? Leave it to the Aussies. Reportedly the world 's oldest beach bar, this family-owned operation first opened in 1885. A boat brings visitors to a strip of sandy foreshore where they can crack a frostie and grab fish and chips while enjoying the fabulous panorama of Sydney Harbour. <p> Not a late place, it 's much more about wine, beer, seafood and sandy vibes than cool sounds or cocktails. <h> 9. The Fish and Rhum Shack, Mauritius <p> Fish and Rhum Shack : If it were any more local it 'd be allowed to vote. This is a satisfyingly rustic hangout illuminated by lanterns, despite its home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coral reef competes only with the pulsing beats of Mauritian Sega dancers who arrive by night. <p> The rum is locally distilled, the beer hails from the village brewery and the menu for the daily barbecue depends on the previous night 's catch and morning market. This is as authentically Mauritian as it gets. <h> 8. Beach Tree Bar, Four Seasons Resort, Hawaii, United States <p> A bar that actually lives up to its name. Forget what you know about Four Season resort bars. This relaxed alfresco grill sits on the sand just meters from the ocean. <p> Besides the stunning sunset view and five-meter vaulted ceilings, Beach Tree Bar comes with a host of little after-thoughts. A spotlight from the building shines on the waves so you can see and hear the waves crashing as you enjoy your meal. <p> The wine list offers wines that all come either by the glass or the bottle for easier selection. <p> And while the prices are what you 'd expect from the Four Seasons brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those and you wo n't worry about a thing. <h> 7. Uxua Praia, Bahia, Brazil <p> You have n't had a proper caipirinha till you 've had one out of a reclaimed fishing boat. Set on Bahia 's Barra do Rio Trancoso, Uxua Praia attracts a laid back, music-loving, athletic crowd keen to sample one of the world 's most beautiful beaches. <p> Featuring vast, cushioned sofas and flat-roofed pergolas, this resort bar was built with reclaimed fishing boats that for years had languished on the site unused. <p> As well as partaking in the fresh seafood and caipirinha, you can try your hand at beach volleyball and sea kayaking, as well as capoeira. <h> 5. Babis Bar, Kalymnos, Greece <p> Ouzo shots every time someone says,? Mamma Mia! Babis ' lively local hive of activity is a well-kept secret on the unsung Greek island of Kalymnos. This rocky outcropping, which tragically lost many of its menfolk to daredevil sponge diving, is perched between the Turkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babis and his family field everything a beachcomber could want. <p> Once you 're done indulging in a hearty Greek breakfast, logging on to the free Internet, trying out all the various beers and wines and sleeping it all off by the free swimming pool or sun-loungers, you can hop on a boat and take a ride over to its own sub-island of Telendos for one of the most spectacular sunsets in the Med. <h> 4. Ponta dos Ganchos, Brazil <p> Beyonc not included. Usually. Brazil 's most exclusive resort, Ponta dos Ganchos, features a gorgeous beach bar with great views, daybeds to lounge on and signature cocktails like The Hook -- cachaca blended with physalis fruit and sugar. Located on a private peninsula on Brazil 's Emerald coast, this is where the local elite -- and foreign guests like Beyonc -- come to get away from it all. <h> 3. Shipwreck Hut, Cook Islands <p> Getting ready for church never felt so good. Hammocks, sunsets, barbecues, tropical fruit breakfasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's served in a recycled jam jar -- - Shipwreck Hut is the bar you dream of owning when you retire. <p> Situated on Arorangi beach on the west coast of Rarotonga, the barbecues are a favorite with travelers, not least because of the corny jokes and barely believable tales of affable owner Jim. <p> On Sundays after an omelet breakfast customers can join a trip to the local church to listen to the locals singing gospel in traditional colorful muumuus and woven hats. Or you can stay at the bar, swing in the hammocks and keep an eye out for whales( depending on the season). <h> 2. Baba Nest, Phuket, Thailand <p> Not couples only. But it helps. This stylish new rooftop venue on the highest pinnacle of the southeastern peninsula enjoys 360-degree views across Phuket, the surrounding islands and the Andaman sea. <p> A deck scattered with beanbags and low tables is surrounded by an infinity pool that gives bathers the illusion of being afloat between sea and sky. Tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature cocktails include a lemongrass and vodka sri-jito and a lychee martini as well as sake-based concoctions. <p> Below deck, ocean-front restrooms open to the elements are bound to become a talking point. <h> 1. Dune Preserve Beach Bar, Anguilla, B.W.I. <p> Good beach bars make you think of retiring. Great ones make you actually retire. Tell Demaria and Sohal we 're not coming back. Pieced together from driftwood, wrecked racing boats and seashells and owned by a gray-bearded, grizzly reggae singer, the Dune Preserve Beach Bar is the kind of place you dream of discovering on your first trip to the Caribbean. <p> And once you have, you dream of staying there forever, to revel in your addiction to jumpin ' reggae tracks and dripping ribs, and to argue politics, philosophy and the ingredients for the perfect rum punch with Bankie, the owner, who can be found at the bar often. <p> It counts ex-presidents, former pirates and Wall Street bigwigs among its fans, but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best beach bar in the world -- - the amazingly affable Bankie Banx and his cohort, who seem to talk in musical lyrics and will teach you not just how to build a boat, but how to build a lifestyle few would turn down
