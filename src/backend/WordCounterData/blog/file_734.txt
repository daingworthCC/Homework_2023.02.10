5182041 <h> Grant McAuley takes a swing at topics from around MLB. <h> Goodbye 2008, you will not be missed... <p> Based on the kind of fun and excitement generated by press conferences like the one above, there was no way that I could( in good conscience) call yet another to wish this calender year a fond farewell. But, believe me, I wanted to. This visual aptly sums up the theme of this season in Atlanta Braves history -- perhaps more swiftly and soundly than the glut of words to follow. A simple theory( if you will note the pictures) would be to blame all of this on those dreaded new blue alternate road jerseys. Suffice it to say, good riddance 2008! <p> There was a palpable excitement when the Braves reported to Spring Training this season. The return of Tom Glavine gave Atlanta a rotation that boasted four former 20-game winners. Unfortunately, Glavine, John Smoltz, Tim Hudson and Mike Hampton were unable to complete one full turn through the rotation at any point during the season. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic of their pasts, both falling to injury in April and combining for just 18 starts between them. When Hampton tore a pectoral muscle just prior to his first start of the season, Atlanta found themselves operating without three of their five regular starters. Hudson was not far behind. Those losses would prove to be crippling to Atlanta 's play-off hopes. <p> The rotation could have been viewed as a complete blackhole by the end of July, were it not for the sparkling work of rookie right-hander Jair Jurrjens. Acquired in a trade from the Detroit Tigers, Jurrjens finished his first full season in the majors 13-10 with 3.68 ERA in 31 starts. Not bad for a guy who was battling for the fifth spot in the rotation in Grapefruit League play. <p> Hampton would eventually make it back, returning in late July -- just as Hudson 's season was being cut short by Tommy John surgery. Settling in after a few rocky outings, Hampton contributed solid work and quality innings over the season 's final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since August of 2005. <p> None of the replacement hurlers were able to match the production of those they were replacing. Jo-Jo Reyes and Charle Morton both showed flashes of brilliance and increased lapses in command. Chuck James suffered a shoulder injury and was shelled in seven starts before a demotion to Richmond. Atlanta did see some quality work from Jorge Campillo, who gave the club 25 much needed starts and proved to be the only capable fill-in. <p> The Braves bullpen performed admirably in the face of overuse and injuries. Projected closer Rafael Soriano was a non-factor for much of the season with a mysterious elbow ailment. A success story in 2007, Peter Moylan was out by mid-April with Tommy John surgery of his own. Mike Gonzalez returned midway through the season to assume the closer 's role and re-established himself as a late inning force. Will Ohman, Jeff Bennett and Blaine Boyer provided the majority of the middle relief work, all making more than 70 appearances. <p> When it came to the offensive side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that Chipper Jones was going to win the NL batting title. As Chipper goes, so goes the Braves line-up. However, poor indicators would have been to reveal that Jeff Francoeur would regress to the point of being banished to the minor leagues and Mark Teixeira would be traded away prior to the July deadline. <p> Francoeur 's struggles were just a microcosm of the Braves season. His average dropped 54 points to.239, home runs fell from 19 down to 11 and RBI plummeted from 105 to 71 as compared to 2007? s numbers. The quick decline have put contract extension talks on hold and put Francoeur 's young star status in question. <p> Lost at the plate, Francoeur was sent to Double A Mississippi in hopes it would jump start his bat. Problems arose from the demotion, as Francoeur voiced his disapproval to several media outlets in the days that followed. It made little matter, because the trip down only lasted for three games. Francoeur was back to his regularly scheduled struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find himself, the Braves lineup hinged on the health of Jones and the production of catcher Brian McCann, who earned his third consecutive All-Star appearance. <p> McCann batted.301 with 42 doubles and a club-leading 23 homers and 87 RBI. His strong work may have been one of the only factors that kept the Braves line-up from coming apart at the seams. I would rattle off a few more statistical accomplishments of other members of the supporting cast, but Jones and McCann fill the star character roles nicely for this end-of-year exercise. <p> Pressing through a variety of injuries for the fifth season in a row, Jones average climbed for the fifth campaign as well. Jones grabbed the batting crown he had just missed in 2007, hitting.364 and belted his 400th homer to boot. That was n't the only time the number 400 and Jones would be mentioned in the same sentence last season. Flirting with a.400 average through most of June was hardly what most teams expect from their 36-year old third baseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age. <p> Though the season was a 72-90 disaster, a record which was a reversal of what many predicted the Braves to finish with at worst, there was hope that resonated through the off-season. General manager Frank Wren came into the winter with more than $40 million to work with in re-tuning the rotation and adding a power-hitting left fielder. <p> Trade talks for Jake Peavy fizzled, as did subsequent attempts to sign free-agent starter A.J. Burnett. Despite this, Wren was able to strike a deal with the White Sox to bring middle of the rotation stalwart, Javier Vazquez, into the fray. His track record of durability was something Atlanta was without in 2008. <p> Many have deemed the off-season a complete disappointment, with no bigger exclamation point than that of the negotiations that turned into a big game of Deal or No Deal with Rafael Furcal. What ever happened, intent to sign or not, the Braves came up short in yet another off-season pursuit. The pains of those dealings may carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to never do business with the Wasserman Media Group again. <p> Now that 2008 has mercifully come to a close, there is reason to hope that the next two months will see Wren make improvements to the club for 2009. It may not be a year of contention and World Series hopes, but with top prospects remaining in the system rather than heading to San Diego, the Braves could return to their play-off ways by resuming the tradition of cranking out young talent and promptly supplementing them with the right veterans. <h> 1 Comment <p> I too feel the pain. Last year was a complete disaster. I think Glavine 's time has about run out. I love the guy as much as anyone but to ask for 15 or so wins is just kidding yourself. I really want Smoltz to return but I 'm not so sure his shoulder will hold up. Hopefully it will. Jo-Jo Reyes needs to go, but Charlie Morton pitched well even while hurt. He deserves at least another year. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pounds. He gained a few and next thing you know his production plummeted. When he came up he was a skinny little guy but he had some speed on him. I think he should get that back. I 'm not a big fan of the big power hitter that
