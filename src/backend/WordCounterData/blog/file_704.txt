5178941 <h> Saturday, November 17, 2012 <p> If there 's one thing book-lovers( and by that I mean frequent readers, lovers of libraries, booksellers, and authors) ca n't seem to resist, it 's a book-themed book. From bibliophilic mysteries to books featuring lists of books, readers ca n't seem to read enough books about books. So I was a little nervous about Mr. Penumbra 's 24-Hour Bookstore, Robin Sloan 's first novel. It was recommended to me by booksellers and librarians and people who read about as much as I do, but that does n't mean much of anything : Those recommendations came with a huge side of bias. <p> I was pleasantly surprised to find a novel about books as they are right now : The narrator, who is not very much of a reader, gets a job at a used bookstore that seems to be losing customers to e-readers.

It 's a cute plot, full of adventure and puzzles, and the main character is suitably charming. Sloan ca n't quite make the central plot pay off in a way that lives up to the mystery he 's built. But with a book like this, the journey is the most important part, and Sloan has found a way to fictionalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more, he 's managed to make it hopeful, cheery, and youthful. That 's a lesson that a lot of book-lovers could take to heart. <p> Sloan first wrote this as an online novella that I stumbled on by accident and I stayed up late to finish it. If it 's still online, check that out. The novel was ok, but the effort to expand and
