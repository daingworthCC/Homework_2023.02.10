5109041 <p> Though much of the news is about Romney getting booed at the NAACP Convention today, not available, except on the convention webcast site( hope someone makes it into a youtube) is the man who spoke after Mittens. <p> But no where in the press have I read even one reference to the powerful preaching of the Rev Dr. William Barber, President of the North Carolina NAACP. <p> It is n't even easy to link to. <p> You have to go to the livecast archive, and once you get there, to the Plenary Session : Civic Engagement( Mittens spoke first) click on the link to " Introduction of Panel " Reverend Dr. William Barber, II. which is in a smaller box on the right below the main screen. <p> UPDATE <p> Thanks to dewtx we have video! <p> Rev. Barber gives a history lesson, brings the crowd to their feet, and tears Mittens a new one. <p> * I have found no transcript -- but even if I did there is no way that words on a page can capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activist preaching. <p> one main message, " if we ever needed to vote we sure do need to vote now ". <p> Do yourself a favor and listen to this brother. <p> I 'm pissed cause as usual, Romney gets a photo op, and the activist message of black folks is ignored. <p> If you have never heard him preach -- here 's a short sample : <p> He was one of the strongest voices in NC against Amendment One. <p> November 12, 2011 - Reverend Dr. William J. Barber responds to a proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment that would restrict the liberties of minority couples in the state. This video is an excerpt from Dr. Barber 's keynote address at the 2011 Equality North Carolina Conference which took place on the campus of UNC Greensboro. <p> So if you get a chance -- go listen. <p> I 'm headed back to listen to it again, and praying someone will find a way to get his message out to folks who did n't hear him today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't figure out, and I am getting sleepy now. But this speech was so inspiring I just listened to it over and over and made this transcript in the hope that we can get some attention for this diary and this speech tomorrow <p> Put it in the body of the diary if you want. <p> The Rev. Dr. William Barber, II Charge to the 103rd Annual Convention of the NAACP July 11, 2011 <p> Good morning, NAACP we certainly thank God for his grace and to our Chair who has called us to be the face of hope our President and CEO who has charged us to remind ourselves that there are more with us than there are against us to all the members of the National Political Action Committee and to all the members of the staff and to our vice chair and this convention chairman <p> Why are we here this morning in this plenary and not in a workshop on voting rights? <p> In the testimony circle of my faith tradition the saints often declare if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to in the tradition of the hip hop from that faith tradition and say if we ever needed to vote we sure do need to vote now <p> for us the right to vote is not just a constitutional matter but a right borne out of struggle out of sacrifice and a gift from the God of justice who 2600 years ago had his prophet say to every nation you must do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before your God and 2000 years ago had his Son say that the least of these must be at the center of public policy <p> think for a moment where we are in the time in which we are and you will understand why if we never ever needed to vote we sure do need to vote now here we are today, Sister Dukes 393 years since the first ship landed in Virginia to bring slaves here we are Sister Coleman where 242 years ago Crispus Attucks was the first African American to die fighting for this country 236 years since the signing of the Declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since we were fractionized in that Constitution and called three-fifths of a person 183 years since Mexico outlawed slavery and 176 years since Texas revolted because they wanted to keep their slaves 163 years since Harriet Tubman escaped slavery 160 years since Frederick Douglass since somebody just quoted him actually delivered in his... actually delivered in his 4th of July speech that America 's July 4th celebrations were fraud bombast hypocrisy until America did right by the sons and daughters of slaves 149 years since the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation 147 years since the end of the Civil war 142 years since the ratification of the 15th Amendment 118 years since the riots of Wilmington North Carolina to stop black political power 108 years since the riots in Springfield Illinois 68 years since Smith v.

A tag like " reform " alone is probably not meaningful. <p> There are a couple of words and names I could n't figure out, and I am getting sleepy now.

To go forward put it in D. " DEMAND CREATES JOBS <p> Here is a YouTube link to William Barber 's NAACP address on July 11. Note that the length was trimmed at the end to meet YouTube 's 15-minute time limit, but not too much is lost. The video is also embedded below( although the video was made in 16:9 widescreen format, it embeds here in 4:3 standard format for some reason I do n't know how to fix--to see the widescreen version, use the YouTube link above.) <p> Liberals think the glass is half-full. Conservatives think the glass is theirs. <p> And I mean that sincerely. I had never heard Rev. Barber speak before, but I felt shivers listening to him roar through this magnificent call to action. If anyone deserves an opportunity to speak at the Democratic Convention in Charlotte, he certainly has earned it many times over. Are you listening Democratic leadership and President Obama? <p> Liberals think the glass is half-full. Conservatives think the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some overprivileged, overentitled, paternalistic, carpetbagging little sociopath not fit to lick his own daddy 's boots thinking he can come in and tell Black people how he 's gon na save them and then whine when they let him know politely that they do n't need his brand of " saving. " <p> to see that this was from last night. Of course, I was here for a few minutes this morning, and then out until now. But I just T'd/R'd/FB 'd your two Biden keynote diaries, so I think I 'm caught up.... : -) <p> Which is good - when the opportunity presents itself, he talks to customers at the gallery about things like this. <p> Sigh the other thing that 's on his radar right now, and not in a good way, is Syria. I seldom see him as thoroughly, coldly furious as he was a few minutes ago, watching a news report showing a young man grieving over the body of his dead father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this reverend 's sermons and find him almost saying something against racial injustice which APG can then edit and twist to look as if he hates white folks and maybe, just maybe this guy will have a national audience. <p> I was n't alive during the civil rights era and I 've seen MLK from this angle of benevolent martyr that no one would ever speak against. I 've always felt the regret and the shame of this country to destroy such a good person who never did anything bad except try to get people to have the rights that we all enjoy today and even take for granted. Even white kids can smile and say that they 're glad that they can eat lunch at school with their black friends. Good on him, that MLK guy. We can say that in retrospect. It 's not even retrospect for us. It 's always been this way. <p> Of course, there 's a whole other dynamic to this when you consider that his death is what made him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die for the normality that most of us enjoy. But I digress.... <p> I can imagine the poutrage and the hate that would have been directed at a MLK back then when I see what abuse is heaped on us every time a black person is first at something huge. This is almost like another civil rights era with racism I 've only read about in history books. This mutherfucker Romney got in our faces and provoked us so he could go back and brag about how he told those lazy nwords off. Here we go again, like when Reagan decided to show his assholishness in the 80s. " Welfare queens ". Fuck you, Reagan. " Tear down this wall! ". Fuck you, it 's already coming down, you fake ass D-list cowboy actor. That 's what I would have said if I was Gorbie. <p> /rant <p> I do n't even know where I was going with this. I just got off work and read everything on DKos about Romney and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pissed. lol <p> " It 's not enough to acknowledge privilege. You have to resist. " -soothsayer <p> Thank you for beating this drum as I had not even given a thought to the rev. So incensed I was about the racist liar using black people as props. Again, just sorry the Sandman had not kicked off his sorry ass. Thanks again, sis. <p> I checked C-Span, but all they had on their site was the speech by Romney. <p> As Chief Justice John Marshall observed almost two centuries ago, " we must never forget it is a Constitution we are expounding... intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. <p> I believe we help each other in times of need. I want all our children to get an excellent education. Every American deserves health care. I love my country. I am a patriot. I am a voter. I am a Democrat. <p> online for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They can extract just that sermon and post it on their channel. <p> They 've already posted Eric Holder 's speech, and Mitt Romney 's speech. So, they have the ability to post this too. It 's just a matter of asking them and getting them to do it. <p> I just watched it, and it 's awe inspiring. If they could post it on Youtube and get people sharing it via email, twiiter, facebook, I think it will inspire a lot of people. <p> Once it 's on YouTube, somebody should send it to the people at Upworthy.com and ask them to promote it too. <p> For me, Mitt reminds me of Jeff Bridges in Starman. He 's like an alien that has n't read the entire manual. You know, he 's going, " Nice to be in a place where the trees are the right size. " -- Robin Williams on Letterman 26 Apr 2012 <p> Thanks so much for this diary, Dee. I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One battle, and was glad to hear him speaking out so strongly and eloquently. But I would have missed this. " These are troubling times. Corporation are treated like people. People are treated like things.... And if we ever needed to vote, we sure do need to vote now. " -- Rev. Dr. William J. Barber <p> I recall as a white dude going to grad school in Southern Louisiana. Going to church there not cause I was religious but cause I wondered what was going on. And to hear this and think to myself, ". " <p> When opportunity calls pick up the phone and give it directions to your house. <p> which is really sad. My parents are not remotely liberals but they could offer up a speech far superior to what Romney did. Maybe at the start of it they 'd say my family owned slaves and we us. <p> When opportunity calls pick up the phone and give it directions to your house. <p> " The fundamental curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other people 's business, and impose its notions, and its will, on people who do not freely accept them. " -- The New York Freeman 's Journal, 1861 <p> But I recall the first time the church I went to had an African American couple come to it. We wanted others to come to our church. I recall them leaving and a long line of folks thanking them for coming as they left. <p> I do n't go to that church anymore, but they now openly welcome gag and transgender folks. I guess Methodist are kind). <p> When opportunity calls pick up the phone and give it directions to your house. <p> MLK stuff. ; -D A few ignorant clergy does not " the black Christian community " make. And then, some preachers are completely apolitical and totally esoteric. They 're all different. This is the kind of guy that can pull ME into church just for the sermons about politics. <p> Nobody says anything quite like a black preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Rev. Wright all those years. Some of Obama 's best speeches have the speech patterns like black church sermons. He took us to church with the DNC convention speech and sealed his destiny. ; -) <p> " It 's not enough to acknowledge privilege. You have to resist. " -soothsayer <p> if white churches were more like black churches, I might have to find a seat. Mom Catholic, Dad Presbyterian, attended Baptist Sunday school as a kid. Only in church for weddings and funerals. And an Espiscopalian church after 9/11 when W said we should all attend a service. It was the closest one to work. <p> This is the kind of guy that can pull ME into church just for the sermons about politics. <p> Nobody says anything quite like a black preacher. <p> There is just something different about it. And it 's better. Seems like more 1 is still infinitely higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. <p> but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. <p> churches that are n't Baptist-type black churches but it seems as if in the black Baptist church, you 're there to get your emotions in high gear. <p> Might have something to do with the Africanization of the Christian church. Slaves brought with them traditions of worship that the western world had n't seen yet. Like the difference between attending a symphony to sit and listen and then attending a rock concert and losing yourself in the excitement. For some, it 's a lot more satisfying to participate and rock out a little bit. That 's what the black church gave the world ; Rock n Roll. ; -) <p> " It 's not enough to acknowledge privilege. You have to resist. " -soothsayer <p> Like the difference between attending a symphony to sit and listen and then attending a rock concert and losing yourself in the excitement. For some, it 's a lot more satisfying to participate and rock out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stand up, sit down, shut up. The Presbyterian services are the same. And oh, give money!! Tried both when I was about 24. Got a call from one of them, they were most interested in what I did for a living. Did n't seem to give a flyin ' F about why I showed up. I was having a crisis and was looking for guidance. That did it for me. Never went back. <p> OTOH, But what from little I have seen, the message from the black church is much clearer and more pronounced. And it 1 is still infinitely higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. <p> my response can be emotionally overwhelming but it can be almost entirely internal or very physically expressed and I can not say that either one is automatically more uplifting or powerful than the other.... <p> It maybe that for some people they can not have one or the other and get emotional fulfillment and energy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of body experience or meditation high is better or inferior to a more physical experience... dancing... or runners high or gaining the summit of a peak after a challenging climb. <p> As for advertising to others... who can tell if a quiet person has just had the most amazing spiritual( of either religious or non-religious nature) or if an exuberant demonstrative person is having a less or more incredible moment in their life? I do know that some are good at faking orgasms... and a more reserved person is neither automatically more deep and wise or more shallow or neurotic... So for me there is no difference between an amazingly performed symphony where everyone is just sitting listening swept away by the experience or a totally awesome live rock concert with the band surpassing themselves before a really fired up appreciative audience. <p> but back to religious services. For me it is hard to have a large roomful of people all have an uplifting experience in a restrained manner... except for the music part but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature. And conversely having a rousing hosanna and hallelujah crowd losing themselves will have a lot of people swept up in true feelings along with some who just like the energy and participate in a group sharing in a less actually religious way. <p> Some just like being demonstrative in a cathartic way that is more about that than anything deeper and nothing wrong with that unless it is labeled as automatically a sign of real belief and emotion. And there is some reason to distrust some and I repeat only some religious leaders who can play the part of a revival tent meeting minister and make a good living at it and not have any actual faith at all. So mostly we can say that emotion is honest and we can trust it but... so too, there is a minority of sociopaths who can abuse emotion and strong feeling and appear to be genuine when they are not... the right wing has plenty of pastors on TV and radio as evidence of that. I sometimes distrust excess emotion and overwrought release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as genuine as the person wants not only other to believe but themselves as well. When it is routine it is more like a drug or a social event rather than a deeper experience. <p> And of course on the other side of things, for every Dalai Lama who can be amazing while just being understated and joyful in a relaxed way... there are other " serious " people who are just an act with their gravitas, presence and force of personality is a manipulation. So the reality of an experience and depth of emotion and understanding is not tied to how it is expressed externally. <p> When I was in high school I went on a couple of field trips to Glide Memorial Methodist Church in SF when Rev. Cecil Williams was preaching -- being in the midst of that crowd, with the choir all colors of the rainbow, made the sterile atmosphere of the conservative Lutheran church of my childhood even more apparent. I left that church shortly after I graduated, and even though I ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote we sure do need to vote now " -- Rev. William Barber, NAACP " These are troubling times. Corporation are treated like people. People are treated like things.... And if we ever needed to vote, we sure do need to vote now. " -- Rev. Dr. William J. Barber <p> MT @NAACP : Loved Rev. Dr. Barber 's address on Wednesday. So inspiring! Put that in a @YouTube video, and it will go viral! #NAACPHOU12 <p> That contains two mentions and a relevant hashtag. Should get their attention. Right now, all of Twitter has just half-a-dozen references to this speech, some of which are mis-tagged( #Obama2012, for instance). <p> --- <p> " The fundamental curse of the Republican party is its irrepressible disposition to meddle with other people 's business, and impose its notions, and its will, on people who do not freely accept them. " -- The New York Freeman 's Journal, 1861 <p> That what we really need to focus on in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us absolutely nothing. You 'd have thought that we 'd be talking about the inspiration and the charge ; instead we have all sorts of armchair psychology about what Mitt Romney( totally unimportant except as the person we need to get out the vote to keep out of the White House) might or might not have been meaning to do getting hisself booed at the plenary. Entertaining, to be sure - but in the end absolutely useless in terms of eyes on the prize. <p> Ahh well, at least folks can listen to what really matters now. Thanks for the link, Sis. <p> instructions were very easy to follow and I 've just finished watching this amazing speaker. Wow. After some sleep, I 'll be interested to go back tomorrow to also watch the strategy sessions. Thanks, again. <p> Dance lightly upon the Earth, Sing her songs with wild abandon, Smile upon all forms of Life... and be well. <p> begin my own day. It is so GOOD to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stays available for at least a while, so whenever I 'm feeling too frustrated, the good Dr. can help fire me up again. :) <p> Dance lightly upon the Earth, Sing her songs with wild abandon, Smile upon all forms of Life... and be well. <p> All day I 've felt really sad, angry, embarrassed, since Romney gave his condescending speech. I 'm swallowed up with sadness and anger that our country has been stricken by all the ignorance, selfishness and greed that is embraced still in all its ugliness. We better pray voter suppression does not win the day for Romney. So yeah, if we ever needed to vote, we sure need to vote now. <p> Thank you for sharing this information and video, the link to the Rev. Barber 's speech, and allowing me to peek into a conversation going on at the NAACP Convention. <p> It 's uplifting listening to how dedicated the NAACP members, activists are to the mobilization to get people out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for truth than live a single day within the comfort of a lie. John Victor Ramses <p> While I was reading your diary and listening to the speech, I was wondering who it could possibly be, when Romney said a number of AA leaders at the NAACP Convention told him they would not vote for President Obama. Is this one of the people he was referring to?( I give a hat-tip to doc2 for this info in his diary.) <p> And then today, there 's this from the Miami New Times : <p> " Carroll, Florida 's highest ranking African American official, spent the morning addressing the NAACP conference and explaining why President Obama was bad for the African American community. " <p> " I spoke with a number African American leaders after the event and they said a lot of folks do n't want to say they are not going to vote for Barack Obama but they are disappointed in his lack of policies to improve our schools, disappointed in urban policy, disappointed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree on some issues like Obamacare, a lot of issues we see eye to eye. " <p> could go to that convention and split to the side of Romney. But you are right, there will always be opportunists and yet I wonder, how much opportunity will they have once Romney &Co.; is done with them? Like making a deal with a snake. <p> I would rather spend my life searching for truth than live a single day within the comfort of a lie. John Victor Ramses <p> but if I did, I 'd remind them of Jeb Bush and Florida 2000 and why the hell would they want to even give that side a moment 's credence? Their answer would tell me whether I 'd want them back on our side or tell them to go take a flying..... <p> This is now easy to find with the link provided. I was knocked over by this amazing speech. <p> I am disturbed by the fact that a restaurant near me is flying the tea party flag. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. I asked them to please not to do that again and why. I 'm learning how to stand up to these asses. What the Reverand says is true. The Republicans say vote for me, and I 'll take away everything I can from you. Not if I can help it. <p> Politicians can say " elect me and I 'll take your healthcare " " elect me and I 'll take your voting rights " " elect me and I 'll take your social security " " elect me and I 'll resegregate your public schools " " elect me and I 'll ignore your poverty " and still get votes! <p>,,, back to every relative who emails me right wing talking points for the entire season. <p> Thanks for this diary. I 'm sending it to my young adult son who has many a political --ahem--discussion on non-political message boards with his peers, many of whom want to vote against their own interests this year. <p> Mitt Romney comes from a very evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are n't many included, but many excluded. Mitt Romney did make one good point, but that was how people might actually support his father, but he is n't his father. <p> Today, The GOP would not vote for George Romney. He would have been beat out by a tea party radical. Today the GOP would have treated George Romney as a traitor. <p> So, Mitt Romney, even your false framing of your intentions, through your intentional deceitful interjection of your own father, does not hold water today. In other words, you LIED. <p> Mitt Romney did not go to the NAACP to get their support. Mitt Romney was filming a commercial. Mitt Romney was using them as extras for his very red state commercials. <p> One day, someone is going to throw an egg at this creep. <p> Not a shoe, but an egg. Hopefully a free range organic egg. Let me tell you why. I had chickens. When you get an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really hard, and gives the egg itself a baseball like toughness. If you have a good arm, you can really get some distance. With commercially produced eggs, the shell is very thin, and will break as you release. There ya go, another reason to go free range, organic. <p> transcript... you Front Porchers must be rubbing off on me( or maybe it 's Led Zeppling doing When the Levee Breaks on my iPod, but I think not). <p> That is some powerful preaching. This was my favorite part : <p> Our parents did more with less than we have today with less they beat slavery with less they beat Jim Crow with less they beat lynching with less they beat the KKK with less Harriet Tubman got 500 slaves out of slavery she did n't have email she did n't have text facebook she did n't have??? she did n't have texting she even know what Twitter was she did n't have a car but she had faith in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a tree and a north star in the middle of the night she did more with less we must do more with more <p> Its a rough row to hoe living in some of the deepest red parts of Texas, but I still get out there, I still knock on doors. <p> I wish we had someone like Rev. Barber here. I 've tried to attend some of the churches in the area but they 've either been preaching Prosperity which is the antithesis of Rev. Barber or I 've been asked not to come back. <p> Great oratory, great message. Thank you for alerting us to Rev. Dr. Barber 's speech. What a fabulous rebuttal of Rmoney 's speech and everything he stands for. Ca n't help but stand up and want to holler myself. I think I have a new sig file ;) <p> his passion and his moving words. Even though I 'm an atheist, I 'm always impressed by the words of a truly passionate and caring religion figure such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right wing theocrats and milquetoast main line ministers. <p> I 've gone to the video archive page, I 've clicked on the appropriate video link, and then it just seems to lock up and forever be trying to load. Too bad - as I got chills just reading the transcript and would so much like to see the video. <p> Now off to scan the comments to see if anyone has a link that might work better for me. <p> and now I have just returned from viewing Rev. Dr. Barber 's address from the NAACP site and wow. His delivery hit me right in the heart, and in the gut and everywhere else. Thank you Sis Dee for bringing his incredible and profound message to us here. <p> I am moved to my core by this. Thank you, deeply. <p> And thanks very much to True Blue Majority for her beautifully done transcription. She captured his message so well on virtual paper. <p> I hope there will be some coverage of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks, but I do n't hold out high expectations on that score. I do hope it gets posted to YouTube, this is one for the ages and one that should be distributed widely. <p> Now that 's preaching! Thanks so much for this. I 've been on vacation and just saw your diary this morning. I am so glad it was still up. What a rebuttal to Romney. Dr. Barber is so right in everything he says in this speech. I am showing it to everyone I know. Thank you Dee! <p> Feminism is the radical notion that
