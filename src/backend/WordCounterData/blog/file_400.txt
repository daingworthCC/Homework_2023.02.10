5148241 <p> AVON LAKE, Ohio -- Mitt Romney began his final messaging push Monday, describing to voters the " real change " he hopes to initiate on day one of his presidency in order to fix the weak U.S. economy. <p> Described as his " Day One, Job One " plan -- a theme often seen on the campaign trail -- the message centers on Romney 's economic agenda in comparison to President Obama 's and the assumption that his proposals will spur growth. <p> " We have a president today who has a different view about where America is, " Romney said during a rally in Northeastern Ohio, a traditional Democratic stronghold.

The massive storm will impact 50 million people and has already shut down major cities throughout the Northeast. <p> Romney cancelled events Monday evening and
