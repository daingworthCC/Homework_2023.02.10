5112241 <p> I think it comes down to a simple " are you/and is the nation, better off today than when Obama took office four years ago? " With the doubled nation 's deficit, out-of-control spending, etc.( and let 's throw in that I lost my job two weeks ago), I have no choice but to vote for Romney for a fresh start. <p> Remember in your mind, that this came about through darling George who bankrupted every company he ever was put in charge of by his dad. Recovery is a day by day event. No politicial is perfect but I do not trust Romney, too many ties to big business and if you tell a fib long enough and hard enough does not make it true. This party has taken on a lunatic fringe that now controls the Republican party. Shame, it used to be reputable. <p> The country is bankrupt because of decades of policies that did not adapt to the new realities of the earth. The worst of which were the social nets put in place for populations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. At-Best-Average is not the answer, clearly. At least with Romney, Mr. Flip-Flopper, we wo n't get four more years of the same disappointment and he could n't possibly do worse. <p> I know we all have the right to disagree, but there has been so much racial and skin head hatred, I am appaled. Romney 's loyalties are with the very rich. Now rich people are not bad, but this is for all the people. I am in the Real Estate Industry and we were dead in 2008 and now we are busy, helping those who got ripped off by George 's legacy. Mitt Romney is the party of the rich and honestly the Republicans are not the problem, it is the new lunatic fringe in the bubble that is deadly and scarey. Politicians as evidenced by Romney will say anything that the wind blows. I can not believe that no one remembers how bad this was and it is improving, but moderately. There is no Santa Claus and Mitt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your part of the Real Estate industry then you were the ones who were part of the real estate bubble and not Bush who had nothing to do with Clinton 's loosening of regulations to let people who had no business buying homes do so at prices ridiculously inflated by people like you and banksters alike. By the way I 'm a dirt poor minority and I 'll earn my money thank you, I do n't need rich people to give me anything. I 'm just as smart as them and all I need is time and an environment that will let me accomplish that. <p> DeMaria, I do n't understand what your saying by hate? What about my comments are so hateful? Is it just cause I wo n't vote for Obama this time( I did four years ago), that now makes me hateful? You do n't make any logical arguments to support your candidate, all you say is Bush was bad and your 're hateful so vote for Obama. <p> Ms. DeMaria - the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats. As Mr. Rats indicated, it was Clinton that forced banks to loan people money that could not afford to pay it back and it was the Democrats that blocked the additional oversight of Fannie / Freddie sought by GWB &; Republicans back in 2004/2005( you can still see C-Span videos posted on YouTube). Your partisan hatred is telling. <p> We are much better off now. My husband lost his job and ended up with a better one. Our stock accounts are doing well again, both our sons got jobs after college during Obama 's presidency, and we were able to get an incredible interest rate buying a recent home. I say 4 more years! <p> After I left comments this morning I received this. Interestingly enough it says what I believe about one turning against another. I received this did not author it and believe it deeply in my heart. The quickest way to take over a country is from dividing and conquering. <p> You really should look at the numbers instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two years of W 's reign. If you look at the jobs report we lost many more jobs in his years, and by the way he had 8 to screw things up, than we have lost under Obama. The deficit the first year Obama was in office was paying off W 's debt. Since then the deficit has been shrinking every year. Debt still increases until we go positive again. Congress is the one that controls spending and it has been controlled by the people who blame Obama but are the real spenders for the last 2 years. Look at the facts, not the retoric. I can provide the data if you need it. <p> the most important events that will happen during the next 4 years affecting the next generation of americans will be the next presidents nominations for the supreme court. 3 justices will retire and need to be replaced. these jurist 's views will affect EVERY ISSUE that is being discussed in these reader comments. which of these 2 men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who is by far the most forward thinking choice. this type of thinking is required in dealing with avoiding climate change disasters such as the one that just happened on the east coast. <p> I do n't even know where to begin but the bottom line is if your doing well it 's despite Mr. At-Best-Average 's efforts to crush the middle and upper class to make them equal to the poor class. I know cause our middle class family was subjected to the same crap 50 years ago in Cuba. History repeating itself. I am partly to blame as I voted voted for the current guy four years ago. I 'm Sorry! <p> Republicans have blocked or held hostage almost every piece of legislation Obama has tried to enact. Whether good or bad legislation, the Republicans have consistently voted along party lines to make congress the least effective it has ever been. This is not what we elect our government officials to do. There is no compromise in Wasington, Republicans and Democrats need to work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeMaria. She talks against racial and skin head hatred and then blabs about lunatice fringe and then wants everybody to be peaceloving and finally ends with ' hate mongering is still here, sad '. Shes promoting hate mongering. What is sad that this woman is serious confused about everything and this is why she writes such contradictory stuff. <p> Do n't know what anguish you are talking about? I felt anquish in 08 when the stock market crashed and I saw my retirement savings dwindle. Now 4 years later, my accounts have recovered and we are in a much better situation. <p> Under Obama government has grown at an incredible rate, spending has ballooned and so has debt. The EPA, The SEC, The DEA, the FDA, and a host of other gov't agencies have passed hundreds of regulations restricting what Americans can and ca n't do. W are far less free now than four years ago, and poorer too. I am voting for Romney. <p> John, None of that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last four administrations. I would HIGHLY suggest people take just 3 mins- JUST 3- to check the facts and not rely on paid advertisers. www.factcheck.org <p> I hate more government, but you really need to check your numbers. The reason unemployment continues to be so high while private jobs are created is that government jobs have decreased. Check the numbers!!!! But I do believe both of the last 2 presidents have a terrible record on protecting civil liberties. <p> I will vote for Obama who walked into the biggest storm possible. Banks failing, Lehman closing, Merrill Lynch and a host of others broke, Citi near collapse, what did people think - the Presidency was like the clapper - new president - clap on all good? Additionally, aside from Romney 's position on cutting taxes I have no idea what this man stands for on any issue as he has been on both sides of every issue and that is a fact. <p> Mr. average-at-best-Obama did nothing to solve the banking crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they left saved the day. The Iraq pull out was negotiated by Bush. Mr average swelled the Afghan ranks to 100000 for nothing, just more dead GI 's. He blew 1 Trillion on crap stimulus. He added a few regulations, was forced to embrace( flip/flop) gay marriage, did virtually nothing for jobs and rammed through the ridiculous Obamacare. His main mantra now is " tax the rich! ". Even if you tax the rich at 100% it would n't even pay for 1/1000th of the debt we have. Other than tax the rich he has no other plan! <p> I have many reasons to trust Obama starting with the fact that a friend who attended law school with him and was in the same firm with him says Obama continues to hold integrity through and through. I trust my instincts and the fact checking that comes to me from the better informed. <p> And, by the way, Madeleine Albright questioned how any woman could support Romney and I question that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up for question after all these years is unbelievable. <p> Again no real reason other than a friend told you. Defend your man for Christ 's sake! Make some impassioned arguments and convince me. So far it 's Clinton said he 's not that smart and a friend told you he is. <p> I love the name calling by the poster Mr. Rats.... and I will not even comment on that. Now Bush gets the credit for the bail outs that Mr Romney is blaming Obama for? Great. I agree we need to reduce the debt and taxing the rich will not cure it, but it sure goes a long way to saying that the middle class should not bear the brunt of the burden, while our ex President goes down to the Cayman Islands to tell a bunch of rich guys how to avoid US taxes by storing their money off shore! <p> Bob it really does n't matter who wins Tuesday. 1+1=2 and no one can change that. Mr. At-Best-Average has already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Meaning say good bye to the cheese lefties. <p> Too many accomplishments on record with facts to back it up. Such as, ending the war in Iraq, improved medical rights for women, student loan reform and most importantly foreign policy. Why elect Romney when he has nothing but promise and no plan? Its really a no brainer who the middle wants. Obama all the way! <p> If you call an executive, someone who borrows money to buy companies, takes a giant profit, sends his money overseas to avoid taxes( still missing those returns Mitt), and then leaves the company bankrupt and employees outsourced or out of work. You 're right Mitt is your man. <p> I will be going with Obama :( 1) the economy is slowly coming back.( 2) as a product of the era where my friends had to go to sweden or NY for an abortion, or worse yet, a butcher- I am prochoice. I ca n't vote for a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is like to be hungry, and poor, and to depend on the charity of others. I do n't believe that Romney would know what to do if his money disappeared overnight. Healthcare - it worked as Romneycare- why is it a sin as Obamacare? We all need healthcare. Romney suggested we send them in a cab to the ER. Not a good idea. Obama is at least aware of climate change - Romney, not a clue. I am not crazy about either but for me, I will go with Obama. I also think it is despicable that some companies are using Obamacare as an excuse to raise insurance costs. Do I know this for a fact- yes. <p> I do n't think Mr. flip-flopper will win, although he may win the popular vote. But if you think it 'll be a renewed hope and change based on leftist principles time after the election then go back to smoking whatever makes you happiest. Mr. average-at-best will have to make a right turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 'll have no choice. In the end whether your left or right, math is math. In the end 1+1=2 and nothing can change that. <p> Deborah... I receive zero government aid... never have. I am gainfully employed... with the same employer for 25 years. In fact... I am financially far better off than I was 4 years ago. I have just purchased a new car with green backs... my partner bought a new one earlier this year... and we are vacationing in Barbados over the holidays. I am buying my partner a month at a spa in Arizona for the holidays. So how are you doin ' B****? Oh... BTW... do not answer... I do not care oh pathetic one. <p> Obama is a Huey Long reincarnate. A second rate Ward Healer propelled into office by resurrected Share The Wealth proponents. And while his Chicago Democratic Machine thuggery and Tammany Hall type tactics can assuage the fears of the misinformed, the truth is that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really believed he could lead the free world with cutesy catch phrases, fist bumps and smile points. His whole campaign has been little more than ad copy for Saturday morning cartoon cereal commercials. <p> I 'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican. I think the folks who run for office are full of dog doo doo. A lot of talk. A lot of promises, but nothing is accomplished. We already know what Obama has or has not done, but it would be interesting to see what Romney will and wo n't do. It 's a vicious circle, and without a doubt, if Romney wins, the same people who vote him in, will be complaining about him four years for now. Politics is a bunch of BS! <p> I was recently told that a certain percentage( both over 50%) of statements made by political leaders of Democrats and Republicans were untruthful. Could that statement equate that they are lies and politicians are not on the up and up? Are politicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their people "?! <p> How soon we forget! I too lost my job in late 2010 and it took me over a year to find a much lower paying job with twice the demands of my previous job. Some of you forget in 2008 the Stock Market was in free fall, the banks were on the brink of collapse, the Auto industry was near failure, we were fighting two unfunded wars, one was started for illegitmate reasons, and you can sit there and say were not better off today? You people need to wake up and stop drinking the Romney kool-aid! <p> Let 's see you lost your job in 2010 and got a lower paying job and you blame Bush or Romney? Based on your logic I think can understand why you lost your job. No one president was to blame for the 2008 collapse. This was due to paradigm changes to the global economy and policies( mostly social nets) that did not adapt to the changing demographic and global realities. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems. Go back to drinking your Obama-aid and stay off the boards. <p> D, Similar situation for me- tried to sell a house in ' 08, lost over half my 401k value and took a lower paying job. Today, my retirement accounts have more than regained that loss, my new house has increased in value at a reasonable rate and I am in a great job, making more than I had in 2008- 2010. Houses in my neighborhood get sold quickly, the Reinvestment Act fixed roads and highways here so my commute is awesome AND we 're getting the high speed rail that Ohio did n't want.( Yea!) <p> KBarber, none of that is Obama 's doing other than the 1 trillion for the " Investment " act that has done nothing to improve the situation over the long term. Just added more debt to future generations so some people could have a $12 an hour job for a few months and you can drive your car more comfortably. <p> QE1 will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. QE3 more of the same and no hope in sight. Remember congress flipped to democrat control January 2007. That congress started to downfall. Clinton was lucky because he had a republican congress to guide him. <p> A large part of being a leader is fostering cooperation between groups of people with different perspectives. Barack Obama has failed miserably when it comes to " reaching across the aisle ". During the Obamacare negotiations, Democrats LOCKED OUT the Republicans who should 've been part of those meetings. Americans have not forgotten how Obamacare, which is 1/6 of the entire American economy, was pushed through on a partisan basis. <p> He famously told Republicans who wanted compromise that " i won ", instead of trying to work with them. <p> Mitt Romney was a Republican governor in a Democrat run state. He knows how to work with ' the other side '. He also knows this from being a leader of a company and from being a leader of the 2002 US Olympics committee. <p> People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expediency. I see that as a strength in this current political environment.. he is not fixated on ideology. He is willing to bend and compromise to get things done. Is n't that what we want from our President? <p> I call him Mr. Flip-Flopper because no one really knows his true core principles as they change all the time. Reagan had core principles that no one could change but he could also be pragmatic without sacrificing those core principles. Obama is just plain average and is n't any smarted than my second grade child. So I 'll hold my nose and vote for Romney just like I held my nose and voted for Mr. At-Best-Average. <p> Dan, I did n't forget the 300+ filibusters in Congress and the 300+ missed opportunities for one half of our Reps to do something. How many bills for job stimulous did n't even get to come up for a vote? What about the incentive to hire US workers and do away with off-shoring tax breaks? Did n't even get a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act, the Violence Against Women Act, cutting funding for Head Start and the move to privatize Social Security. I know how many Millions of over 50 folks do n't have 401k 's and no salary to save anything meaningful for retirement after 30+ years of work. SS is insurance against poverty and it speaks to the heart of the kind of people we should be. No Romney please, if he ca n't be honest and just TELL us what his plans are, I ca n't hire him and just wait and see later. <p> Do you know why the Democrats got their butts kicked out of the House in 2010?... the last election? <p> Because Americans were sick and tired of them pushing all of their legislation through on a partisan basis. Did you forget about that? <p> The Republicans in the House were hired, by mandate, to STOP the Democrats from spending all of our grandchildren 's money, that we have been borrowing from China. Thus, the fillibusters. <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are two sides of Congress, right? Harry Reid 's Senate sat on over 20 bills that passed the House, that were related to improving the jobs situation.. THEY DID N'T EVEN VOTE ON THEM! Who is the obstructionist party??? <p> And since we 're talking about the Senate, where is the Democrat budget? They did not pass a budget in over THREE years! You want to talk about dereliction of duties? That 's the Harry Reid Senate. The ' do nothing ' Senate. The obstructionist Senate. <p> And ' plans '? What are Obama 's plans? He has run his campaign as though somebody else was in office... he is running like he is the challenger. Sorry, President Kardashian, you have been in office for FOUR years. You took a bad situation and made it worse. You are over matched for the job. <p> It amazes me that Obama gets blamed because he should have done more the first two years when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is it? He is blamed by his own party for trying to compromise too much and by the other for not compromising enough. I say let 's drown them all <p> Well Mr. At-Best-Average did n't win the popular vote at the Dem primary in 2008, it took a global economic collapse to beat McCain and a hurricane of cataclysmic proportions to beat Romney. He will become a republican after the elections to deal with the fiscal cliff. He already said so. <p> Let me also add a couple of personal reasons why i do n't like the way Obama has done his job.. <p> All of the tv shows, radio shows( Pimp with a Limp? really?), hosting celebrities at the White House( he has spent MORE MONEY entertaining than ANYBODY EVER)... there is a good reason why many refer to him as President Kardashian. <p> If things were going along well, then ok... you have time to do these frivolous things. But things are not going well. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our area.. millions and millions are underemployed, etc. <p> The other thing that bugs me is how this sitting president started fundraising in earnest and campaigning LAST YEAR! No other president has ever hit the campaign trail earlier than Obama. He did n't have any competition in primaries, yet he was still out fundraising in Hollywood and Manhatten and out stumping when Rome was burning. I find these behaviors to be reprehensible. <p> Mchenry county. Is full of selfish ignorant republicans. I am so tired of all the blah blah All you do is cut down and point fingers at people. Lets come up with solutions. You 've spent the last 2 years in a vicious attempt to destroy Obama. Instead of tell me how you are going to fix things..... Anyone that would put that much effort into being destructive is not American. Therefor the right choice the honest choice. The only choice for me is Obama!!!!! <p> As far as I know republicans have put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't matter who wins Tuesday, cause after the election it 's a turn to the right to deal with the fiscal cliff. CUT, CUT, CUT <p> Oscar, did you read the articles on Patch last week about how foreclosures are going UP in McHenry County? <p> There are a lot of people out there who are feeling a lot of pain. <p> Can you tell me how Obama is going to fix things? He has n't spelled these corrective actions out, maybe you have some insight? <p> Honest choice? really, Oscar? Obama just recently lied to us about what he knew about the terrorist attack in Libya. He lied, people died. True, Oscar.. The father of one of the men who was murdered says that " Obama murdered my son ". What do you have to say about that, Oscar? Obama is the ' honest choice '? God help us all. <p> Most democrats these days sleep walk throughout the day thinking " Obama is president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Gitmo is still open and will be 4 years from now. Four years ago is was hell on earth itself but now it 's not so bad after all. <p> I am not going to say one or the other. I just know that no matter what the outcome is, we all know that our country is in dire need of major changes. It is not just one man that can turn it around, it requires the support and dedication of all that are under him. We are at the mercy of others who will shape our lives and the lives of our children for the future. Whom ever gets elected has allot of responsibility to fix and find solutions for what has not worked in the past. Not an easy task to tackle. So I find the possitive of what has been done, what could be done, and hopefully a change for better things to come. <p> Victoria, that 's why Romney is the better choice. He has proven an ability to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a state that was mostly Democrats. <p> Some people criticize him for not being fixated on his conservative ideology. I believe that we need a guy like Romney who is not so set in his ways that he can compromise to get things done. <p> He is competent, hard working and presidential. You wo n't hear him on radio shows like ' Pimp with a Limp '... you wo n't hear about him hosting lavish parties in the White House every other week with celebrities. All he is going to do is work. He might not be as cool as President Obama, but being cool has n't helped too many people find good jobs and get off of foodstamps. <p> Who should be president?????????? Obama? amnesty and the dream act for 20 million illegals if elected and if he can get it approve by the GOP congress?? Giving 20 million illegals amnesty the best thing for unemployed Americans? no. Romney???? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rich?? is that good for America?? no.. Neither candidate is good for America. Not voting for the first time. <p> If you do n't want to vote for either of them, consider voting for a libertarian.( : This will open up a third spot for next election if Gary Johnson gets at least 5% of the nations vote. I 'm voting for Obama but I understand where you 're coming from.... if you vote Gary Johnson your vote will maybe at least make a difference in the future( : <p> Who are you? How can any intelligent woman vote for the right wing ticket? Do you have any empathy towards others? You better hope you or your significant other( if you have one) never lose your job, your health care, or get a life threatening illness. <p> Wow, only a loony leftist would think that all women have to vote for dems. I think women are smarter than that. Women vote just like men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best interest. <p> Gitmo was a good idea under Bush and Obama has done a good job keeping it open. Four years ago it was everything to the lefties, now not such a big deal. Only because Mr. At-Best-Average currently occupies the " seat " or perhaps not as you and Clint think. <p> I am voting for Romney. He is a better choice. Obama has done nothing for this country. He became President on a bet and people voted for him. Shame on you people. The guy had NO experience what so ever. He lied and cheated his way into jobs. He has not done anything for America but bring us down. He should keep his promise. He said if I do nt do a good job then I will become a one term president. So be it!!!!! Romney is our man!! <p> Obama has done nothing? Obamacare is NOTHING??? Obamacare has changed my life, and unfortunately, people whom it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the young adults, the generation that is SCREWED, benefits so much from Obamacare. <p> Also, Romney is probably a bigger liar than Obama is, AND he reminds me of a greasy car salesmen. Seriously, how can anyone believe anything he says? Why would any woman vote for Romney???? <p> These ' investigative ' journalists from ABC, NBC and CBS will go back to investigating fraud and reporting it instead of trying to cover for the president. <p> Do you know that NBC news has n't talked about Benghazi in over a week? and that 's with new information being released.. do you think they would do that for a Republican? No way. Elect a Republican so the media can go back to doing their jobs. <p> Obama keeps claiming that Bush caused the housing bubble. BS. It was caused by the constant insistence of Barney Frank, Chuck Schumer, and Harry Reid that lending restrictions needed to be loosened to give people unable to secure a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what then happened. People who were making $400 a week bought $250,000 homes with $1200 a month payments and quickly went into default. <p> The republicans fought against this but the dems, who had control of congress, pushed it through by threatening banks with a congressional investigation if the rules were not relaxed. Look it up. <p> Republicans tried to investigate / reign in Fannie / Freddie back in 2004/2005, but Democrats blocked it declaring the programs were " sound " and Republicans ' fears of a collapse were " unfounded " and " hateful ". YouTube has the C-Span videos of Maxine Waters, Barnie Frank, Chris Dodd, and the rest of the cast of characters. <p> Think about it - FOUR years before the collapse Republicans were warning of the problem, but were pushed aside by partisan democrats with the help of the MSM. If you want to look for blame in the huge crash, look there. The VIDEOS ARE STILL THERE with the Democrats speaking - their OWN WORDS. <p> Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion in debt One down grade and anothe looming 24 million need real jobs No plan for energy other then to attack coal industry and produce a car no one wants Foreign policy is a disaster Benghazi coverup Where is the transparency we were promised Where is the bipartisanship we were promised Where is the CHANGE? Obamacare is a disaster Fiscal cliff looming and the president does nothing Record low labor particapatiin Record numbers on welfare food stamps President never attends security briefings President has n't met with his jobs council in a year Time to FIRE the " empty chair " Vote Romney/Ryan. <p> Unfortunately, Illinois has been run so far into the ground by over taxation and spending that much like California, there is little hope regardless of who is in the White House. We are the poster child for the effects of long term democrat policies where the least productive are sustained by the most productive. The problem is that wealthy people and businesses are n't stuck here. They can and are moving in droves to offshore markets. So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to legitimize their aberrant lifestyles or failures through legislative acceptance. So, please vote for Obama, and continue to be lead to the gallows by his masters in organized labor. When the wealthy and their jobs are gone, you can work in a government salt mine or whatever is left. <p> The economy will do better once the tentacles of Obamacare are removed from the books. The looming taxes, fees and penalties on the middle class from Obamacare will help folks buy more, that changes everything. <p> One thing they couldnt buy is insurance. Many people would not be ale to buy insurance and the spiral of bankruptcy due to healthcare expenses would continue. Those of us payingour bills would continue to subsidize those without insurance through higher healthcare costs. The so called tax on the middle class because of Obamacare is based upon unfactual information, but that does not surprise me. The Republicans have tried to win at any cost, including many lies. Its embarrassing what they have done. Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago now lies about most everything he previously said. I want a President who is truthful and has a backbone. Obama is a clear choice. More so than when McCain/Palin was the choice. <p> Insurance premiums are escalating higher now that more is forced by law into policies, such as contraceptives, abortions, etc. With so many people out of work, the economy in turmoil, the Obama supporters can only claim lies at the truths thrown in their face. <p> McClown... My brother-in-law is a actuary for BCBS of Illinois. He is voting Obama. The big insurance companies are fearful that Obamacare will be repealed. At first they did not want it... now they see dollar signs and do. Barack will be re-elected and Obamacare will be safe from repeal... find your crying towel dude cake. HAHAHA <p> @Chris - exactly, Illinois is an example of what progressive policies will do at the national level. But people think everything is FREE because Obama said so. Illinois is bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do not care who will be the next President. I offer how to create jobs and fight climate change. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL GHGs HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE!!!!!!! 1. Government of Zimbabwe( 1990-2005) order to cut 21% of forests for crop production RESULT : area with drought history, became SEVERE DROUGHT. 2. From 2000 and 2012 killer beetles destroyed more than 100,000,000 acres of forests In USA and Canada. 2. Are these dead forests evaporate additional water from soil, or increase humidity in air and probabilities of rain? THESE DEAD FORESTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DROUGHT OF 2010, 2011, 2012, FOR HURRICANES LIKE SANDY!!!! <p> 1. We must build small power plants inside affected forests to produce electricity, hot water and heat from the cheapest wood energy. 2. We must clean our ponds, streams, creeks, rivers, lakes, build reservoirs to collect spring water, 3 We must build systems of relocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will create jobs with huge profit from electricity production and increasing crop production from farmers fields. <p> PREVENTION! PREVENTION! PREVENTION!!! Prevention is always cheaper than emergency spending. FEMA, EPA must be reorganized from spending organization to FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION!!! We could start these directions right now with huge profit, instead of disasters. These jobs will never go overseas despite globalization of today level. <p> Climate change is real. Been happening for a gazillion years. It 's cyclical. <p> Man made climate change is b.s. <p> When Michael Mann fudged the data because it did n't support the narrative, that was all the proof i needed.. Michael Mann is a liberal. Liberals lie, cheat and steal to support their narrative. If you know liberals, it 's ALL about the narrative. <p> Well everyone, it was n't bush 's fault for the economic fail, it was actually.... Clinton 's fault. He deregulated the banks in his last part of his term. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well it allowed banks to gamble with our money and make loans, a lot of loans, risky loans and it caused a housing melt down and it also caused banks to stop giving credit to business like small businesses that needed that to hire people, give benefits and so on. So it caused businesses to fail, layoff people stop buying new product. Which caused a economic collapse. You all make not believe it but bush tried 17 times to regulate the banks and the democrats refused to sign it 17 times. Look it up its a fact. Look I 'm not a bush fan but we have to stop blaming him for every thing. No president was perfect not even Clinton or Reagan. <p> As far as Obama ya it does take longer than 4 years but we are going the wrong way. Romney is a better choice based on the facts. I 'm sorry if you all want to ignore what 's been going on the last for years, but if you look at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mass.( Which is why people call him a flip flopper) and the fact he never took a dime from his job a govnoner or from the Olympics that 's character. He may be wealthy, but news flash so is Obama! Romney had a job and earned it, Obama was a????? What jobs has he had? Community organizer? Romney gave 100% of his inheritance to charity, yes 100%. The rest he earned. Listen I could go on and on. I am an independent and i did like what Obama had to say in 2008 I listened and I really thought he was different. But I 'm a women, a small business owner wife and mother and in not better off than 4 years ago and my customers are not. I 've read up and did my homework I do n't care about birth control or all that war on women I care about my future. My rights and my country and I think we 're in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all able to vote, make our on opinion and have freedoms other country 's do n't have and I think these rights are in jeopardy. Do everyone get out and vote either way. <p> Mitt is a flip flopper not by being " bipartisan " but by making a statement and then a week, more or less, later doing a 180 and changing his mind to say something else. That is not the sign of a decisive and strong leader. He should have had his platform and ideas in place so that at least he was consistant. <p> James do n't forget NO BUDGET plan ever!!!!! Our president and the democrat Harry Reid is required by law!!!! To have a budget! Every other siting president did it but not out current one. It 's against the law! But yet no one cares! Broken promises, telling us he will reduce our deficit in his first term! Oh ya blame bush. He knew what our deficit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into and made all these promises and yet you all think Romney 's the liar. <p> While all of you complain about which candidate will be worse for the country, I 'm going to waste my vote on Johnson. At least then I wo n't be voting for the status quo of more spending and debt and less freedom. <p> All I have to say is that if we are to believe any/all of the political ads on tv, in print, on line, on the radio... we should n't vote for anyone... they are all liars, tax evaders, frauds, flip floppers, deadbeats, anti someone or something like women, seniors, minorities... think you get the point. I wish there would be one candidate who would just stick to telling their point of view on an issue, stay consistent and not throw crap at their opponent.... just one... <p> If you were to forgive Obama for all his failed policies, the one thing that that should wake your @ss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies and the media does n't have the balls to call him out. Look at all the attention Cindy Sheehan got when her Marine son died... Nobody but Fox News picks up the story of Charles Woods... Anyone who votes for Obama might as well have the blood of four dead Americans on their hands... Anybody but Obama!!! <p> I like reading all these comments. Very entertaining and uninformative. You 've got both sides of the political spectrum arguing about who would be better, by saying that the other party/candidate/pundits are worse liars. If I choose to research numbers myself or with the help of sites like Factcheck.org, I find out that most of everything candidates tell me is a lie. Lying to inflate their numbers or lying about the records of their opponent. <p> Then we get into who is going to ruin/destroy America. Neither candidate is out to destroy/change America so the entire population is screwed. As the popular vote generally shows, the country is split at any given time roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little high... closer to 55-45ish. One side will always think the country is going on the wrong direction. <p> What it ends up boiling down to is the hot button issues( abortion, guns, civil rights.) No matter who we elect, our tax system is a mess. We need taxes to subsidize the government, but everyone wants/demands lower taxes. We overspend on everything, from the military( that spends a majority of it 's time not defending our direct borders or our democracy) to the so called entitlement programs that keep us from having a good portion of country in savanna style shanties. <p> What we could use is somebody who does n't treat reelection like his only job. Get in their and actually work to balance the budget by trimming from both sides of the aisle. <p> Not worrying about your base hating you for cutting one piece of their pie. Work to make a fair tax plan across the board. Get rid of some of the crazy positions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep our country safe, not liberate everyone who is n't like us. Revamp our welfare system to cut out abuse of said system. I know that is n't done overnight by any means, and it is n't as simple as just doing these things. But we all know we are on a bad track going down slowly. Until we can get someone who does n't just pander to the right( Romney) or the left( Obama) for four-eight years and treats the office as an opportunity to fix things and not a popularity position... nothing will change. We 'll just continue to teeter totter to the left and right every few years. <p> Yes Dan and mchenry county is run by republicans. And Deborah. Come say that to my face what are you making assumptions because of my ethnic name. Wow. You might wan na check yourself. And again that is a typically republican tactic. And. Obama did n't lie. He actually admitted he was wrong about 9/11/12.... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate is qualified. Neither candidate has the american people in their best interest. Period. Let 's be honest. The election is a joke. Either the socialist current leader will win, or Mr. Moneybags will. Regardless the country will continue to run itself into the ground while the rest of the world watches. <p> Lets all blame someone else for the problems instead of taking the initiative to fix them yourselves. Take a good look at this country. Really. Look at how people parent. Look at how there is no accountability. Look at how people buy their children. Buy their way to the top. Look at how so many people ca n't even fix a simple household problem. Lets just continue to point fingers at everyone else or the government. People have forgotten what 's important. People have forgotten what it means to be a family and work together towards a goal. America has become selfish and it shows. I 'm done arguing with ignorant fools. For Deborah to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is disgusting. I know slot of good hardworking Hispanic people deb you could learn a thing or two from them and. They work 2 or 3 jobs and no they do not collect government asst. adios <p> We gave Obama a chance in 2008. He is not able to live up to his promises. Look whats happanning in our community. Have we ever had so much crime? Obama is a failure. Lets give Romney a chance., at least he held a real job. We have to vote for Romney to save our country. <p> Why do the republicans Hate women so much? Why do the republicans Hate the elderly so much? Why do the republicans Hate the middle class so much? Why do the republicans Hate the American worker so much? Why do the republicans Hate our veterans of foreign wars so much? Why do the republicans Hate unemployment benefits so much? Why do the republicans Hate the poor so much? Why do the republicans Hate social security so much? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do the republicans Hate health care reform so much? Why do the republicans Hate public education so much? Why do the republicans Hate minorities so much? Why do the republicans Hate our public lands and our National Parks so much? Why do the republicans Love big corporations so much? Why do the republicans Love big oil so much? Why do the republicans Love big pharma so much? Why do the republicans Love hedge fund managers and CEO 's so much? Why do the republicans Love the 1% so much? Why does the 99% keep voting AGAINST THEIR BEST INTERESTS so much? <p> Obama / Biden 2012. " Continuing to clean up the mess of the Republican Great Recession. " It was a huge mess. It 's gon na take a while. <p> If it helps to keep being told that your failures are because of racism or some other " ism " then vote for Obama. Because someone else was successful means they were given preferential treatment over you? Does that make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has pretty much run everything based on blaming someone else for his failures. You can continue to delude yourselves into believing you 'll be successful if you 're given a " level playing field. " But, the truth is, you will always be a failure. Whether its under socialist policies or capitalist policies. One just gives you a better face saving excuse than the other. I do n't share your delusions. Successful people will be o.k. regardless of who is in power. And anyone can be successful regardless of who is in power. So quit wasting your energy looking for someone to blame cause at the end of the day, its all you. <p> It is interesting to see how Obama has tied so much of his campaign rhetoric, campaigning, advertising to Bill Clinton- so much so, that it seems like Clinton is running... oops, I guess she is... in 2016. It is also interesting to see how many women who support Obama are forgetting Bill 's indiscretions, impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was under Clinton, by Executive Order, which allowed Credit Default swaps which turned the mortgage business into a giant casino. I am not quite sure if Obama could/can win without his Clinton 's help- and, we all know Bill is doing it for his wife 's election run in 2016. <p> BTW, I do n't believe anyone has commented yet about how James Biden,( brother to the VP) company received a HUGE multi-million contract to build homes in IRAQ. What, you did n't know? And, should the President win, buckle your seats for a wild ride to the Fiscal Cliff during a lame duck session. And, David, you have obviously a lot of strong sentiment and feelings, but you should check your history books and facts. It is actually positions like yours which are polarizing instead of looking at the political spectrum as a complicated mosaic. <p> DeMaria, I too am part of the real estate industry, &; we all have to share the blame for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodd &; Barney Frank for their part, Fannie Mae &; Freddie Mac for insisting lenders make loans regardless of qualifications. Realtors bought into the bubbleas much as the lenders &; many Realtors made a lot of money during that time &; were happy to ride the wave. So we ca n't blame everyone else &; not take a close look at ourselves. BTW this post will show " reject " but it is not rejected by Patch. <p> I could list at least 40+ reasons why I am voting for Obama-not enough room here. And basically just one why I would never vote for Romney-he is a liar, or as some more delicately call a ' flip-flopper '. What no Romney supporter has ever been able to answer me is how do you honestly support a self proclaimed ' man of faith ' who lies thru his teeth at every opportunity, changes his mind on every issue of his platform based on the audience at hand, promotes scurrilous attacks despite being proven false, e.g. the recent Jeep ads, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lying for the Lord " Mormon premise so ingrained from youth that encourages this effortless and masterful performance or is the man really a sociopath? No one has yet to explain or defend the lies, so thoroughly documented-there are now 34+ volumes of them ; but simply deny the existence of them. How can you honestly believe him? Just what is it you are voting for? <p> Well, apparently Q, you are capable of responding to my post with an accusation but incapable of responding to the well stated question, demonstrating... hmmm... that Mormon teaching tool of ' do n't answer the question asked, but the one that you think should have been asked... " just proves my point. Thank you. <p> You have just proved the point about liberal intolerance. How dare you make snarky comments about anyone 's religion, who are you? Also, the jeep ad is true, claiming it as a lie over and over again does not make it a lie. Crysler did move its production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them on my dime. <p> David, You make it sound like Republicans hate everything. Do you hate ALL Republicans? It sure sounds that way. Do you have friends who are Republicans? Do you hate them because they are Republicans? You made blanket statements in your post which any intelligent person must kniw are untrue. Why do that? It refects poorly on you. There is a lot of vitriol in many of the posts. We all have our own opinions of who our next President should be. I am voting for Romney/ Ryan because I believe we need a real change. I am not rich, I am a fiscal conservative, &; 5 trillion dollars in new debt goes against everything I believe in. BTW this post will also show " reject " but it is not rejected by Patch. <p> Four years later and people are still blaming Bush which I ca n't believe. Obama has had plenty of time to right the problems of our country and he has not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some fresh blood. Vote Romney <p> Have you looked at the facts Kathy? It took 8 years to get us into this mess. Mr Romney has said he will fix it in 8-10 years but you think Obama should have fixed it in 4? Thin about it. 4 years ago the stock market was tanking and we all lost 50% of our retirements. The stock market is now back. I hear how gas was cheaper when Obama took office but it was the most expensive under Bush and came down when the economy tanked. 3 years of positive private job growth versus 3 years of mega losses under Bush. Yes unemployment is still too high but much of this is due to the reduction in government jobs( yes they get unemployment too), yet the republicans cry there is still too much government. Which is it reduce government or reduce unemployment? <p> Unfortunately we are at a point way down the road of collapse at the hands of activist politicians and interest groups, a point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case that would be Romney. Maybe he can start a turn around. Certainly Obama can not. He has demonstrated his lack of experience and incompetence and needs to withdraw quietly. <p> I will not vote for a president who lied and tried to cover up Banghazi and blame a video. I will not vote for someone who will not give the American people the truthful explanation of events. The media is clearly not reporting on this to help president Obama till after the election. This is a disgrace. The Economy is terrible and I do not feel safe with this kind of leadership. Give the families some answers. Why did you do nothing while you watched these brave men being attacked. Why did you blame this on a video for over 2 weeks when on 9/11 you knew it was a terrorist attack. <p> Tina, Any loss of life is terrible, but I am curious how you know the President lied or was just told things that turned out to not be true? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better but during the 8 years W was in office 43 Americans were killed in Councils or Embassies around the world. I think no one should die but it is a lot better under Obama than W. <p> Just remember, the tea party is alive and well. WIll Mitt have enough back bone to stand up to them? I do n't think so. If he is in offce, the Tea Party will exert pressure and he will cave. That will be extremely harmful to us all( except of course, the very wealthy). <p> Boehner does not, why should he. Any Republican that wants support of the party must sign a pledge to Grover Norquist to never raise taxes on the rich or they will suffer the consequences. They are all beholding and have sold their souls. <p> Eicy and Bob are 100% correct. Glad to see some people on here pay attention. People should take the time to read about Grover Norquist and learn about the Tea party 's agenda and their financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidders. <p> I was always told in school that to understand a word you need to break it down into the smaller parts. Let 's take Politics for example. Poli or Poly is defined as many. Tics or ticks, are blood sucking parasites. Therefore politics must be many blood sucking parasites. <p> I would like to recommend the Quarter Quarter policy.. Every Quarter we get rid of a quarter of the current politicians and replace them with new people. It would take 1 year and all the politicians that ca n't get things done will be replaced.. <p> Clearly a vote for Romney is a vote for a lack of integrity. One who cheats his church and nation out of revenue, one who flip flops at every opportunity and one who has a CLEAR record of screwing the working class. <p> Anyone who votes for Obama is clearly uninformed and did n't do their homework. They are delusional. This is n't a plug for Romney either. This is to call out these people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There are so many lackies out in this world it 's sickening. The number of votes Obama gets just shows how many of these delusional lackies are out in this country. And there are lots and lots of them. SICKENING! <p> Did Obama propose something different in how to improve on record unemployment, foreclosures, low GDP, credit downgrade and massive accumulated national debt? Not a word except tax the rich, how does that improve and grow an economy? It only gets worse folks. <p> Unfortunately libertarians will never have a chance, too many sheeple. Libertarians need to infiltrate the Republican Party. For example, If Ron Paul were younger and after the primary he worked his way to a VP pick, he could place himself next in line to the presidency. You can replace Ron Paul 's name with anyone else you see fit. I personally do n't like either candidate but, I 'm not willing to let Obama choose 2 liberal Supreme Court justices and the Benghazi debacle in unforgivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... <p> This is exactly why we need an Independent educator and technologist like myself in public office. <p> I was never a Democrat nor a Republican, however I am an American, first and foremost. Our Declaration of Independence is my foreign policy. Our US Constitution is my moral compass for making domestic policy decisions. I have witnessed premeditated voter suppression in a myriad of forms by both established parties. Any attempt to confuse, delay or deny voters to vote is an attack on our democracy. Period. <p> I am not perfect but I will try to do my best. I do n't have all the answers but I will thoroughly examine all possibilities with both Democrats and Republicans to reach the best solution. For me that means job creation. I refused all monetary campaign contributions for many reasons. <p> One reason is that I will not work FOR lobbyists, banks and unions but I will work WITH them. Most importantly, I will not put a price tag on our kids, especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not turn a blind eye to the foreign money laundering that is undermining our election process under the guise of super-PACs. <p> There is one singular promise I can make to my fellow Americans ; if I 'm privileged enough to become your congressman, I will make our US Government more accountable to the American people like never before in our history. <p> Once we all have the truth, and nothing but the truth, can we all become informed voters. <p> PS - I offered both of my fellow congressional candidates to an open and civil debate. The debate needs to be open because education is everyone 's concern and civil because personal attacks is paralyzing Congress in a perpetual bureaucratic gridlock. The budget needs to be balanced, jobs created and education improved. No more excuses! <p> Both the Democrat incumbent and Republican candidate refused. <p> For clarity, when I say refused I mean that I did not receive any reply or excuse whatsoever. <p> Wow, if this is a cross section of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess we are! Our politicians are just average people like us, they could be any of us... take 15 minutes and read the lunacy above... the Feds are n't the only sad state of affairs in this country. Intelligent conversations, sharing of ideas and ideals, compromise and working together for OUR Country... has been totally lost in the midst of lies, hate and ignorance.... from BOTH sides. You should all be ashamed of the the things you say to each other and the hate you spew out over the safety of a computer! How about letting your children read this nonsense? The left and the right have out of control extremist, they both lie, they both preach hate and they accomplish nothing that does n't benefit them in the long run. We as Americans must stand up and vote for what we feel is best for the country, not our " party ". Start rebuilding our country at home with the local vote, pitch in and help, train people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the greatest generation, before they are gone.... because we are a long way from being a great generation. Get out and vote, exersise your rights... then get ready to pitch in and help, no matter who wins. Do the right thing, not the easy thing. <p> Dear Bob The last time I checked this is not an election between W and Obama. The president knew that this was never about a video. The way the media has avoided this is a total disgrace. He ca n't have it both ways. If he said it was acts of terror in the rose garden then why talk about a video for over 2 weeks. He still wo n't talk about it. It is really very disturbing and sad. So many unanswered questions. The Vice President, Hillary and the President need to answer the questions. If any republican was in office the media would be all over this. <p> Right in todays news, Romney says that if elected, he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the mess they caused and weaken unions. Translation : Take money from the middle class and give it to the banks and corporate CEO 's. Romney will destroy the middle class. <p> Is there any truth to the rumors that Obama is moving the election night party from the McCormick Place to Murphy 's Bar &; Grill in Honolulu? You have a chance to win tickets, no airfare included, if you donate $5 to the Obama ' Real Change is coming, baby ' campaign fund today. <p> Hmmm.... is it true Romney 's election night party will be in the Hamptons, only a few miles away from people who homeless and shivering out in the cold from Sandy 's destruction. You know... the people that do n't count. BTW, Romney wants to get rid of FEMA, the agency out there helping these people, and let the states fend for themselves in disasters like this. <p> @Paul... Obama wants to take $900,000,000 from FEMA. You need to get out more. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a discussion about which one of these men is more charitable towards his fellow American? Romney has consistently given his time and money to charity. Obama likes to take my money and give it away. <p>.. and after this storm, which man was out there collecting relief supplies and actually help load the truck? Hint : it was the guy who does n't even have the job. <p> Dan, thanks I get out plenty. Obama does want to trim that amount from FEMA 's budget, which is 3% of their budget, vs. Romney wanting to abolish FEMA, which by my calculations would amount to a 100% reduction. In all fairness though, in the wake of Sandy, Romney is flip-flopping of course, suggesting that staes take the lead without abolishing FEMA. And Romney should be charitable, he is worth a quarter of a billion dollars.... maybe more, after all we really do n't know how much he has in those offshore accounts to avoid taxes. <p> The video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces behind the government programs, which were thousands of powerful banking and business lobbyists who spent billions of dollars pressuring congress to pass bills that helped them and in the end crippled us. In 1982, President Reagan persuded congress to pass a law authorizing the use of exotic loans, which in turn started the housing crisis. You tube videos can tell 3 minute snipets of whatever you want, try reading the many books available who are written by pulitzer prize winners, nobel laureates, economists and historians if you want a broad overview of what has really happened over the past 30 years to destroy the middle class and make politicians and CEO 's wealthy millionaires and billionaires. <p> Andrew Sullivan, leftwing blogger for the Atlantic, recently made the assertion that if you ".. are white and voted for Obama in 2008 but do n't vote for him in 2012, that vote in 2008 does n't count.. " <p> What he is implying here is that your vote in 2008 was some kind of proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you double down, maybe you really are. <p> Personally, i thought we used up a great portion of the white guilt out there in 2008, electing a man with an intellectually radical past and not much experience to hold the most important job in the country. <p> However, it 's apparent from statements like this one from Sullivan and other similar sentiments from Chris Matthews and Ed Schultz, etc.. that there are still a lot of people who are full of white guilt. <p> 95% of all black voters will vote for Obama. They are n't prejudiced in Andrew Sullivan 's eyes. <p> If 60% of whites vote the incumbent out of office, an incumbent who has led the sorriest economic recovery in history, there will be a lot of people saying that white people are still stuck on skin color. <p> This fits the liberal narrative... and if you know any liberals, it 's ALL about the narrative. <p> Do you ever wonder why we hold elections on Tuesdays? Australia holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have more time. Also, it is required by law there, that all citizens of voting age must vote or face a fine. There is 95% voter participation. Food for thought. <p> Paul, There is no more danger to the republic than when Congress is in session. If the Congress passed useful laws there would be less need for more laws. Mostly what they do is destructive. You should be happy that the Republicans are keeping us safe from the Congress. Or to put this another way, Paul, if you have problems, just let me know and I will tell you what to do and how and when. But it will cost you. Fair enough? <p> Jim, so the Republicans are keeping us safe by wanting to repeal the regulations enacted to keep the banking industry from running off with our money again? We need politicians that work together for the good of all Americans, not politicians that are owned by big business, special interest groups and the wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money spent by Obama, it is he who is running off with our money, but you 'd rather not recognize this. He bailed out banks, waived Obamacare requirements to friendly companies, funded green companies that turned out to be frauds, will impose taxes and penalties on middle class folks with IRS Obamacare fees, threatens rich people with higher taxes, eliminates any confidence in investment or consumption. Obama would rather redistribute welfare and food stamps to people for votes. <p> Gary, can you tell me what he spent it on and why? Perhaps it 's because the housing crisis decimated our economy and millions lost their jobs due to layoffs, or corporations outsourcing jobs oversees. It 's hard to take in tax revenue when there 's millions less jobs and multi-national corporations are sheltering their income overseas, not to mention that our military budget is more than all the other countries of the world combined! And yes, it 's not just the banks running away with our money, the Bush tax cuts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past decade, while CEO 's like Oracle 's Larry Ellison lined his pockets with $706.1 million in pay and stocks in just one year, Michael Eisner of Disney $575.6 million, abnd the list goes on. I 'm not saying that government does n't waste our money, just that there 's plenty of blame to go around. <p> Just to clear things up, the Bush tax cuts were for everyone. The economy under Bush was good, until the housing crisis started. The ill effects on the economy from the housing crisis is any easy play on morons when Obama packages fiscal policies as the cause of the financial meltdown. Just like when all the Democrats voted for the war in Iraq, only to step aside and later call it Bush 's war. Sorry, but I have a memory, like when Obama called the general a liar when he provided good news resulting from the surge of troop strategy. <p> Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress, Paul. Try to refinance or get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over three months. This after the government forced the banks to give bad loans to folks so that everyone could own a home. Now that same government is correcting the problem which it caused in the first place with more " laws ". And you are worried about the banks? Lawmakers are not like thieves who steal and carry off. They are more like cockroaches which fall into nasty stuff and make a mess. I suppose you point to Illinois as an example of how well a Democraticaly controlled state has done. <p> Jim, we tend to only see the laws as they are passed, not as they were originally constructed. Most laws, bills, etc. are radically different than first proposed. Lobbyists, big business and special interest groups control our government, and when a lawmaker, be it Democrat or Republican, trys to get a sensible piece of legislation passed, it is usually unable to get passed unless it is butched in the process because of the enormous pressure of outside money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tio go around, but let 's look at the underlying problems that are at the root of this. <p> McCould Bush did cut middle class taxes, we all got a huge $300 check..... remember? the millionaires saved an avg. of $100k in taxes, totaling A TRILLION dollars for the last decade. I 'm trying to have a fact based discussion while you resort to immature name calling... sad. Gary, to be clear, I was not blaming you, but rather the aforementioned politicians, lobbyists, CEO 's, etc. <p> Unfortunately you lack the knowledge necessary to correspond. You lack the ability to know what a budget surplus is, the national debt and a budget. The surplus that you speak of did not exist, but was a mere projection of ten years out with nothing else in the economy changing( Clinton trick). The national debt is something completely different, try reading more about it and get back to me. <p> I 'm so glad that Obama has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on making sure everyone has food, water and electricity. He certainly does lead by example, does n't he? <p> Oh, this did n't happen at a good time for him? Well at least he was able to do a flyover and have some pictures snapped of him looking presidential and acting like he cares before he decided to get back out on the campaign trail. <p> McCloud, I went back and found that the budget deficit/ numbers surplus varies according to the date the numbers were calculated, so I stand corrected. But they are certainly not 10 yr. Projections, but yearly projections. As for the national debt, every president <p> Since Reagan has increased the national debt. When Clinton left office it was at 5 trillion, when Bush left office it was nearly 10 trillion. Obamas first year saw a 3 trillion increase. Point is that runaway spendind started a decade ago. <p> Just a question for Paul? What do you do for a living? And are you financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama made lots of promises he did n't keep. Where I live I see lots of failed businesses. Lots of restaurants just hanging on by a thread. Do n't see many people better off. <p> There are over 20,000,000 out of work. Unemployment in black communities is up to 15% <p> it 's not all about you, Alice. <p> There are less workers in the job pool now than in any time in the last 30 years.. do you know what that means, Alice? Less tax revenue. There are millions more on permanent disability than in 2008. This means that these people will never contribute tax revenue again, but we will pay for all of their needs until they die. <p> Alice, this is n't all about you and YOUR family. <p> We are 16,000,000,000,000 in debt. We have gone 5,000,000,000,000 more into debt in the last 4 years. What did we get for that, Alice? <p> You have sons? Hopefully you will have some grandchildren. <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that, Alice? Is that ' fair ' to them? <p> I am so sick of people who do n't have the ability to look around them and read about the dire situation that this country is in and only look as far as their own front door. I 've got a word for these people.. <p> In my best Rodney King voice... " cant we all just get along? ". Lets sit in a big circle, hold hands, close our eyes and sing " kum by ya " while our world burns... to all of you NOT voting for Obama, do nt waste your time trying to argue your point with Liberals, Liberalism it a mental disorder with no know cure. When the day comes when we are the financial cliff, you know who to push first... <p> A tie... Maybe we can have co-presidents? :). One, an Alinsky- trained community organizer where no one remembered him at Occidental College, who voted " present " the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and who is more interested in golf and going on The View then coming clean on the torture and murder of diplomats in Libya and the other a former Governor who turned around a scandal and financial Olympics mess, a very successful pro business person who envisions a strong private sector economy. Obama 's only saving grace has been his symbosis with Bill Clinton 's campaigning. <p> There 's no way to spin this -- it 's pure, unadulterated, blatantly obvious media bias, in which information extremely damaging to Barack Obama was kept from the public, to protect the President at a moment of crisis. <p> CBS News has finally revealed the full contents of the interview Barack Obama gave to Steve Kroft of " 60 Minutes " on September 12, 2012 -- the day after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, which the President and his people would go on to misrepresent as a " spontaneous protest " for weeks, in addition to stonewalling every inquiry into their handling of consular security before and during the attack. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it all shakes out, they can say " hey, we released the information we had... we did n't cover up anything "! <p> Of course, releasing this info at this point in time is like a Friday afternoon news dump.. it will get lost in the news cycle and not get the scrutiny that it would 've if it would 've been released in a timely manner. <p> I give credit to CBS for at least talking about Benghazi.. NBC has n't mentioned it in almost two weeks. <p> I 'm a small business owner Tina, and I 'd have to say that I 'm not financially better off, but I am an Independent that has voted for both Republicans and Democrats. I vote for the person I think has all Americans interests at heart. All presidents make promises, and can keep them only if members of both parties work together to solve our problems. I simply believe that Obama has honestly tried to make this a better country for all Americans, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans. I also do n't trust Romney to help the middle class. We find ourselves with a strong possibility that whomever wins will not accomplish much due to the partisan gridlock in congress. I 've been trying to say that the whole dam system is the problem, that 's not liberalism, it 's reality. The political system is geared to, and run by big money, we all lose. I have my opinions, which are formed by research and reading.I try to back them up with facts, not campaign rhetoric. <p> Cooperation from republicans? What about when the democrats ruled the House and Senate? What did he do to help Americans then? I do n't think Mitt is out to specifically help any group - the 99%, the 74%, or the top 2%. A rising tide floats all ships. We all do well when the country as a whole does well. Obama is a failure. He is out of ideas, and his earlier ones have failed. Obama already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January. Even he has seen the reality of waning support. Leaders lead, losers blame. <p> I agree with you, Paul. For members of Congress, elected as servants of the people, to state that their single most important goal is to make this president single term is not only wasting tax payers money, but unpatriotic and dividing the nation. <p> And Fox is a mouthpiece for the conservatives. Have we covered all the pertinent networks now? I do nt pay attention to any of the networks nor the ridiculous attack ads that are run 24/7. I have no idea what half of these politicians stand for because they 're too busy trying to destroy each other. <p> Obama can work with the other party. They just single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president. " They felt by obstructing everything the president attempted to do he would not be elected. Well guess what, it 's looking like that strategy failed. <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his rear end kicked tomorrow by the voters in his home state? They know him and will not support him. Does n't say much for him " reaching across the aisle " not does it. Looks like romney/ryan 's going to lose WI as well. Say 's volumes about ryan 's standing in his home state. <p> You are making the huge assumption that whatever bills are being blocked would somehow be good. Seems to me just about everything passed into law has got us to over 16 trillion in debt, 23 million unemployed, 1% GDP, record foreclosures. What new ideas in these bills were we denied the privelege of experiencing? More jobs/stimulus bills? More entitlemets? How did they work out before? <p> Paul, I do not believe Obama has tried to help small businesses at all. Romney will work with everyone on both sides. He is a businessman. I do n't know how a small business person could think they are better off. Look at unemployment and welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses. How can you trust the president when he has n't come through with his last election promises? <p> 23 million unemployed has nothing to do with any legislation, but rather the fact that corporate america is sending jobs overseas so that they can reap historic profits with complete disregard of it 's affect on the economy or the middle class. As for foreclosures... that was on the horizon by 2006. You need to read the story behind it rather than say that some bill he passed caused record foreclosures, that 's just absurd. <p> Perhaps the bill that regulated banks from asking certain underwriting questions, which led to Fannie/Freddie Mae buying back the bad loans from the originator of the loan. Who would n't write as many loans as they could, since there was no downside or risk thanks to Uncle Sam. As for shipping jobs overseas, how does the burden of Obamacare fees resonate with keeping jobs here? Or was that something you need to google real quick. <p> No McCloud, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been paying attention. Stop reading headlines and start loking deeper into the problem. The bill you are speaking of was a watered down version of the original one proposed. Why was it watered down and thus largely flawed? Because of intense pressure on politicians from the banking and financial industries through thousands of lobbyists spending milions of dollars to keep any meaningful reform from occurring. Googling wo n't show you that, but you already know that, do n't you? <p> Frankly, I 'm lost, what is it that you are attempting to say? I conclude that you think anything proposed as a bill and blocked by Republicans would have helped solve the 23 million folks out of work, the 2% GDP, the record number of people now on welfare and food stamps, since the bills were Democrat sponsored? <p> More small businesses have closed down in the past 4 years than the Great Depression. The man has total disregard for American business. All he is concerned about is raising taxes to redistribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business! More government! The man has never signed the front of a paycheck in his life. He has no business acumen at all. None. Zero. <p> As for Obamacare fees, that had absolutely nothing to do with the millions of jobs that have been lost to China, India and other countries tbat offer subsidies, cheap labor and unfair trade practices. IBM now has more Indian employees than.American employees. That trend started long before Obama took office. <p> So, the 6 million jobs eliminated from the Bureau of Labor statistics since Obama was elected, and helped the unemployment rate remain at 8%, had nothing to do with employers uncertain about Obamacare penalties, cause you said so, right? <p> Romney reminds me of a greasy car salesman, and it seems to me that people only are voting for him because they want to see more " change " than we 've had with Obama. This is why the US goes back and forth and back and forth between Republic and Democrat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I can say that he has done one thing that has significantly changed my life, and that is with Obamacare. Obamacare makes sense. He 's also repealed Do n't Ask Do n't Tell, which was another big movement of his. It is hard to come by a president that will take actions that he thinks are right and not just actions that he thinks are going to get him re-elected. <p> In a global market labor costs are a big factor as you must know. If I am selling widgets for four times another manufactuer, I better get my costs down or I will be out of business. The fact is that the American standard of living went up way too fast after WWII to be sustainable mostly based on inflated dollars printed by your beloved government. If stuff was not made in China etc, we would have shoes at 500 dollars and all that stuff at Home Depot etc at ten times what it is now. The fact that your politicians pandered alot of this into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have American industries g out of business. Boy, that would really help. You sound like you are envious of people and/or companies with money. Not very useful. Maybe you should worry more about how you can become more successful. The only way my money can be redistributed is to have it taxed and then given to someone who did not earn it. My goal then would be to be one of the ones who did n't earn it and therefore get it from you. I seriously doubt that Romney wants to raise taxes for that purpose but changey hopey does. <p> Also, please keep in mind that it 's hard to totally change a country in 4 years. Give him a little longer and do n't just cut Obama off just when he 's started. If you think a job market can be turned around in 4 years, especially after Bush was president, then you are ignorant. <p> Anyways, Obama has had quite a recovery. I guess the people that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are going to get the job market back to ideal condition in 4 years. I do n't know if anyone could do it, there are so many factors to be considered. <p> I should have made myself clearer then. I do not believe that a single president can turn the job market around in 4 years. And by " turn around ", I mean get it to ideal conditions. This is what I specifically mean, and I still stand by my first comment. There are so many other factors that determine the job market, and to think one person can change it in 4 years, is still ignorant. Case and point! <p> Obama has now and had then 4 years ago no experience whatsoever to run a corporation as large as the US. Remember he was tutored in Crook County, State of Corrupt Illinois and City of Corrupt Chicago by some seasoned Democratic veterans, need say anymore. Vote for Mitt who has a proven track record of success and experience in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> KC- hate to burst your bubble but the US is NOT a business and it should n't be run as one. If you call shutting down businesses and profiting from it and shipping the jobs to China then yes he has a successful track record. <p> As I said, the standard of living here is comong down and will continue to go down. We might even have to cook, clean, do our own windows, lawns, snow shoveling, laundry, have only one car, not fly very often, have one or two pair of shoes and trousers, smaller houses or no house, etc. Even if the jobs " come back ", the wages will be lower. <p> Heading off to England. I just want to say to say I hope you really enjoy the next four years should Mittens win. And good luck- you 're going to need it. I would love to read your comments when the Mittster totally destroys what 's left of our democracy in order to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. Face it, Romney is the biggest liar to ever run for president, and if he is elected, he 'll soon prove it. No ethics, no morals, and no care for all of the sheep he 's fooled. Your taxes will be going up, the deficit will increase even more, and you will most likely be joining the ranks of the lower class if you 're not there already. And with no regulations, expect more pollution in the air and the water. And do n't expect the FDA to warn you about bad food or medicine. All that beauty you can find around the country? Sorry, the oil and coal industries will make sure they do n't exist anymore. And you know how much fun Sandy was? Do n't worry, another fun storm is sure to hit. McCloud, a special call out for you. A genuine member of the Fox electorate who knows less than people who do n't even watch the news. I really hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or my friends to bail you out when you 're broke. Why should we care when you ca n't offer us anything. You are simply too insignificant. You know, it 's all about ' me ' in this Ayn Rand world, right? What ever happens, you are responsible. Good luck there, little buddy. <p> Well said, Sully. If No Morals Mitt wins, I wish I could say, you all got what you wished for, now live with it, however, I will be stuck here along with my friends and family. With his allegiance to Rove &; the Koch boys and mostly to himself, I can only say if the worst should happen, I wish that I were going with you. <p> Rove? check. Koch Bros? check. you did forget to mention Bush, Cheney and Rush Limbaugh, but i 'll cut you some slack. <p> and tell you a story about ' no morals Mitt '. <p> Mitt Romney was CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one morning, an employee asked him for time off. His teenage daughter was on a road trip to NYC, went to a rave and came up missing. <p> Romney declined to give the man time off.. Romney gathered all his employees( around 30), explained the situation and then CLOSED BAIN DOWN and flew everyone to NYC to set up shop at a hotel and start a manhunt for the missing girl. <p> They put up thousands of flyers, went to ' raves ' and clubs and showed people the girl 's picture, etc.. they spent days there until they found her, unharmed. <p> That is the epitome of leadership and high morals. <p> Do you have any Obama anecdotes, other than getting stoned with his college buddies, that you 'd like to share with the group? <p> Anyone playing the race card is automatically discounted as an Obama hack. I do n't care *what* someone 's skin color is( I married a man of color, and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If you 're a terrible leader and President, that 's the bottom line. If they ca n't blame Bush, I guess these folks will try to blame just about anyone. As for me, I voted for Gary Johnson. Illinois will go to Obummer anyway, and I 'm happy to vote for a human being I actually agree with almost 100% on every issue. <p> It 's all about Ohio and I think the polls have it wrong, again. Mr. At-Best-Average( Obama) is in serious trouble. <p> Only 503,813 Democrats have already voted or requested for an absentee ballot. That number may seem like a lot, but that number is 181,275 fewer than in 2008. If 100,000 of those fewer votes came from Cuyahoga County, Obama will be in trouble. The problem for Obama is how much the Republicans have improved since 2008. The data suggests that 448,357. Republicans have either voted early or have requested an absentee ballot. That is an increase of 75,858 voters from 2008. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Romney has accomplished the first key to victory. <p> Second key is Hamilton. Romney carries a 7 point advantage in Hamilton county and he should win by at least 5. <p> Third key is Romney needs large turnouts from Putnam, Holmes, Warren, Auglaize and Union. He leads comfortably in those counties but can he mobilize enough of them to offset Cuyahoga, I think so. <p> Most pollsters are way too optimistic on Cuyahoga county coming out in droves tomorrow for Mr. At-Best-Average. It ai n't going to happen. <p> I agree with George Will, 321-217. Mr. Flip-Flopper wins and I know he ca n't do any worse than the current underachiever. <p> Damn, I regret voting for Jimmy Carter 2.0 but what was I supposed to do? Vote for a ticket that would have placed that loon Sarah Barracuda just one 80 y/o heartbeat away from the office? I love this country too much. <p> This year, our own federal government, through the Department of Health and Human Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer. " This unprecedented action could force the punishment or even closure of faith-based soup kitchens, schools and hospitals because these institutions would not fit under the federal government 's definition of " religious. " It is an ominous sign when the federal government issues the edict that Catholic Charities and other religious employers are not religious. The mandate is both illegal and unjust, and constitutes an unprecedented affront to religious liberty.1 As we did in the Fortnight for Freedom, we continue to ask the laity to pray and be active in opposing this mandate that we feel is a violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as other federal laws. <p> That is erroneous. In February, a workaround option accommodation was added for religious liberties regarding contraceptive coverage which was accepted by both the Catholic Hospital Association and Catholics United. Both organizations stated that the new regulation fully respected the religious liberty of Catholic organizations while maintaining access to contraceptive services for all employees. " <p> I am not incorrect nor do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition from bishops but was eventually strong armed into toeing the anti contraceptive line in June after vociferous debate ; Catholics United remain firm. They additionally stand against politics from the pulpit and the most outrageous threats and fear mongering coming from some of the bishops. I know my sources. It is the bishops filing suit. In case you have forgotten, sir, WE are the church, not just the hierarchy the bishops. <p> The Catholic church is not a democracy, you must be confusing your weak understanding of the Church with the US Constitution with your " We are the Church " slogan. In case you have n't paid attention, there is outcry every year regarding Roe Vs Wade in a march on Washington DC. Voting pro-abortion is wrong, accroding to the Church, end of discussion. <p> I would like to add, Bernie, that as a Catholic mother, I investigated the ACA and found the US Bishops feigned outrage and their response, the Fortnight for Freedom, a sham. Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest offense to religious liberty to be contraceptive coverage and marriage equality, while at the same time condemning &; chastising Catholic nuns for caring for the ' least of these ' to be the utmost in hypocrisy. I can not speak for the bishops nor attempt to explain their hidden agenda, but they lack moral authority as Shepherds in protecting the most innocent among us. Where was their indignation &; outrage during their 60+ year cover up of pederast priests? Or their outcry after Roe v Wade or every year since? They should have been marching in the streets. And apologizing constantly to every victim. Where was the Fortnight for Freedom then? What about routine, mandated vaccines made from aborted fetuses-their stance is that it is ' permissable for the greater good '. Our own Shepherds have let us down. Yes, we do need to pray. Fervently. For our church and our elected leaders. <p> To all you demented republiCONs... with a special shout out to McClown... as you all head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... just know... you will not be missed! Here is a big HAHAHA in your faces... good bye... and good riddance. <p> Hey... Deborah. ZERO. You might want to read up north in these comments to find where I first answered your obnoxious question. LoL... Oh and... a special bye bye to you too as you slither beneath your rock. <p> Well it looks like the Democrats DID have a solid election strategy in Pennsylvania. <p> Their method for trying to win involved kicking out 60 elected Republican poll watchers from Democrat area polling stations. <p> These are paid, elected, positions. <p> Who among us would disagree that at every voting place that there should be at least ONE Democrat and ONE Republican to witness the process and bring up questions of fidelity? Nobody. It 's totally fair. <p> Yet, in Philadelphia, the Democrats, supported by the election commissioner, who is also a Democrat, had the audacity to physically kick out all of the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happened early this morning and it is being overturned, but which party wants to suppress the vote? <p> Oh, and there are reports that one of the poll watchers was a lady who was assaulted as they booted her ass out of the polling station. <p> We know which party actually respects women.. and it 's not the Democrats. <p> Alice, is n't it about time that women stop whining about " women 's issues " and take responsibility and take care of themselves? Women complain that they want " equal rights " and yet they want candidates sympathetic to women. Which is it? You can not have it both ways. <p> I do n't need candidates " sympathetic " to women. I just need a candidate that does n't want to needlessly have me raped me with a foreigh object because I have a medical procedure. Keep your creepy christian noses out of my uterus, and I will go on just fine. Thank you. <p> For those filled with venom and hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln at his first inaugural, facing much darker times : " We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. " Let us all, citizens, elected officials ascribe to the better angels of our nature. <p> Hey Deborah... You are a idiot... a sour grape chewing idiot. Keep your mindless blather to your own damn self... no one cares what you think. Oh... BTW.... HaHaHa... you are on the losing side of life. Ignorance must be bliss!!! <p> Time to start working together on the multitude of challenges that we face. Congress and the Obama administration need to find common ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name calling, finger pointing or ideolgical rigidity that holds our country hostage. <p> I do n't know about ' hammered '... seems to me based on the below that Mr. Obama best see that nearly 1/2 the voters do not approve of what he 's been doing. The election is over, now all those newly elected and those re-elected can hopefully do something to get the economy back on track here in the USA. I 'm not holding my breath though. Seems the only ' stimulus ' that has created jobs, and also took away jobs, is Sandy. <p> The popular votes are still coming in, but Obama has a slight lead with 59,621,436 to Romney 's 56,989,709. <p> Could you explain that comment please. We are embarrassments because we are capable of taking care of ourselves and standing up for our own rights and do not need the Democrats to take care of the " little woman "? I am actually pretty proud of the fact that I can take care of myself. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishing that anyone who disagrees with him was dead. I predict we will be reading about your rampage in the paper some day soon. And sorry, my parents wanted me, unlike yours. You are obviously the product of a botched abortion. <p> What a bunch of sore losers.... Ca n't stand the thought of the black man getting another 4 years and just when you thought we might be able to return to the 1950 's! Boo Hoo. Your right wingers should get the message( your party is out of touch). <p> Sorry my guy lost, but I 'm not overly confident either one has the will to do what needs to be done to move the ENTIRE COUNTRY in the right direction. The wreck is coming regardless of who is living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We do n't need an ideologue from either side of the aisle, just a guy that would say " political philosophy be damned, I 'm going to rescue the country ". But perhaps a country only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We 've likely had ours already. <p> There is no doubt I 'll probably pay more in taxes over the next four years, just a little less beer money I guess. Maybe a good jobs program would be to teach Americans how to speak Chinese so we can all move overseas and work those jobs that got outsourced. Wo n't be many new ones here anytime soon. <p> At the end of the day, so long as all the politicians leave my rights intact( i.e let me go to church unencumbered, let me go to the woods and hunt with my boys ocassionally, and let me use whatever damn lightbulb I want - guess that makes me a clinger) I can pretty much ebb and flow with the political tide of the day. But, it is kind of like seeing your son fall in love with the hottest chick in town - you know she 's going to spend all his money, break his heart and when its over he 's gon na regret he even @ @
