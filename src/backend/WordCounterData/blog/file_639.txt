5172341 <p> A few years ago, I was able to take 15 days off or so and leave with my sister to South Africa which turned out to be an incredible adventure in so many different ways. I wish I could explain how it felt!! I spent the first half of my trip in the Kruger National Park( South Africa 's biggest) for a 4 day safari where I saw an incredible number of animals. I did find a few of my good pictures but there are so many more. It 's really quite a feeling to be standing a few feet away from these incredible animals and I truly hope that anyone wishing to see this in person will get the opportunity! :) <p> I personally went in the middle of June, so winter over there. It was very comfortable during the day but cooled off significantly at night. It 's a good period to go since there are less crowds! Other good periods are the spring( to see the little ones) and their summer where there are more crowds but animals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations looking for water :) <p> Here are a few of my pictures, hope you 'll enjoy :) <p> P.S : You 'll notice that I have no lions here... incredibly, while I saw many other animals including cheetahs from very close.. I did not see a single lion!!!!! Very disappointing obviously but it is nice that you do n't automatically see all the big animals and have to look for them,
