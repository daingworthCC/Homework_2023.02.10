The countdown starts now so vote today! <p> Voted for the options that will spoil the game the least! Do n't want to know anything about Liz 's protector! Or the handymen, although I do want to see more of skylines, seem like one of the best aspects of the game. <p> why would we vote for something we have already seen in other trailers and how much time is there until the trailer comes out, I ask @ @ @
