5191341 <h> The Sunday Sip The Fine Cooking Subscription Giveaway Winner, Pie, 350 for 7 Minutes and the Dish of the Week <p> Happy Sunday! Have you recovered yet? Even more importantly, are you having pie with your coffee( like me)? I love these days after Thanksgiving. Even Dudette 's been allowed to have French silk pie for breakfast. That 's what holidays and long weekends are all about. So, pull up a chair, grab a slice and a cup and let 's chat. It 's been a busy week. <h> Care Packages <p> Those who know me or have been reading this little piece of the Internet for any length of time know that chocolate and I do n't have a love relationship. I 'm not a fan. Unless it 's white. White chocolate draws me ; it sings me its siren song. So, when Adam and Cheryl from Picture Perfect Meals flashed a photo of White Chocolate Bark with Dried Fruit, Nuts and Candied Ginger across Facebook, I just about sprained my finger in my effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I left a comment. I might have mentioned the fact that Adam and Cheryl know my address. Not that it was a hint. <p> But it worked. A few days later, I received a care package via express mail. I am now the proud owner of White Chocolate Bark with Dried Fruit, Nuts and Candied Ginger. Well, I would be if there was any left. My friends, you need to make this. Christmas is coming. If you can resist eating it yourself, it 'd make the perfect gift. <h> The Pies <p> Thanksgiving dinner is nothing without pie and there will always be a pumpkin pie at my table. It 's my absolute favorite. The middle pie is blueberry and the one on the right is French silk. I know, I know ; chocolate in my house, that I made after what I just said above. Go figure.( It was pretty darn delicious.)( I make lots of pies so I can have pies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 Minutes <p> Ever since Dudette began coming home from school with drawings of turkeys, pilgrims and ears of corn, she insisted on ' assisting ' me in my menu planning. Unfortunately, her suggestion was singular and repeated( often). Boeregs. Again, boeregs. For weeks, boeregs. Those wonderfully delicious triangles of phyllo dough filled with six cheeses and other goodness. Thanksgiving came ; massive amounts of boeregs were eaten ; Thanksgiving went. <p> The next day, Dudette asked for boeregs. Seriously? She ate at least six the day before. As I was on my way out the door, I yelled to Hubby to reheat the leftover batch at 350 for 7 minutes and left. Dudette decided her Daddy needed reminding and left the instructions on his desk. That 's a keeper. <h> Another Care Package <p> Ninety percent of the packages that come to our house are from my mom for Dudette. Just this month she 's received a box filled with three kinds of gourmet popcorn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Twice. Remember the Kenmore Blogger Summit I attended some time back? I won a slow cooker in one of the team competitions. It was delivered yesterday and I 'm in love. Yes, that 's a mini-me next to the big 7-quart gorgeous, gleaming electronic gizmo. Imagine a bread pudding in the big cooker with caramel sauce simmering in the mini-me. <h> Lemonade Out Of Lemons <p> Was there bitterness that two packages showed up at the house and they were both for me? Yes. Dudette was very bummed. But she 's not one to pout for long. Instead, she and her friend Boo had loads of fun with the bubble wrap and box. And that up on the toes pose that Dudette 's doing ; that 's called Tiger Stance. It 's a Tae Kwon Do thing not an ' I want to be a swimsuit model someday thing. ' At least it better not be that. <h> The Next Giveaway <p> Chances are good that you 've used MyRecipes.com to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you were supposed to bring an appetizer.

All three of us thought it was very tasty and made a nice, healthy pre-Thanksgiving dinner prior to the big day. I do n't know that I 'll make the rice again, but the chicken will definitely have another appearance on the menu. <p> That 's my week. Other things did happen( like almost setting my broccoli casserole on fire), but I 've already talked about that stuff elsewhere. Life goes on and we have to roll with it ; do like Boo and Dudette did, make lemonade. So, have a fantastic week be good to each other. <p> What a fun week you 've had!! Mail, with actual things for mom! That does n't happen too often here, and when it does, yes, it usually causes a bit of jealousy even in my teenagers. So glad to see Dudette up and smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it going around here, lots of sick people this Thanksgiving. WE 've been doing lots of hand washing. That white chocolate is awesome!! I have a recipe set to make for my dad that is very similar, I will have to check their version too. I 'm not chocolate partial, as you know. Well, I do n't really like milk chocolate... but it will do in a pinch. Your pies are beautiful!! Ours are gone, but I 've already had requests for more. Happy Sunday!! Hope you are warm. <p> Dudette is WAY over her flu. In fact, I think she 's making up for her down time by having triple the amount of energy she had before. It 's like she 's mocking me with it. Thanks for the compliment on the pies. Pies are one bakery item I can do really well. And if I do mess something up appearance-wise, that star tip and whipped cream thing covers all sorts of glitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! =) Good thing your parcel included enough bubble wrap to make kid sized wraps, eh? LOL There 's just something about bubble wrap that lightens almost any mood. Glad you had a nice holiday! We went up to my daughter and son in law 's and had a grand time. I have n't gotten to really spend holiday time in the kitchen with her in years, so for me that was one of the best things of the whole trip! Well, that and going through old family pics on both her computer and my laptop. heeee! My youngest loves white chocolate, so I 'll have to go look that up. Thanks for the tip! =) <p> Congratulations to Brittany Renaldi enjoy trying out all the great recipes you will find. I love lentil soup, can hardly wait to see your recipe. Boxes and bubble wrap, can there be more fun toys to spark the imagination? <p> When you cook the bread pudding and caramel sauce please let us know.There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you. Just keep the bubble wrap away from Adam though, he 's too prone to a second childhood around these things. <p> Wow, just look at your gorgeous pies!!! My boys would like me to adopt your Thanksgiving tradition and have a slice of pie for breakfast.... I remember my mom eating pumpkin pie for breakfast many a time I love your Sunday recaps! <h> Copyrights <p> Please feel free to share any of the information you like here on your blog.
