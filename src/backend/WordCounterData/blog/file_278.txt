But no name change can deter people from turning to Google to find local businesses, so it 's important to understand the impact of these recent changes and how your business should alter its review strategy accordingly. <p> To cut down on the amount of potentially fraudulent reviews and fake accounts, Google has adjusted the amount of information you have to give before leaving a review. The biggest change is the requirement for users to have a Google+ profile with their picture in order to leave a review for a business. <p> Before, any individual was able to leave a review on a business ' Google+ Local page anonymously. This meant any person, could write anything they want about your business, while hiding behind a vale of anonymity. This also allowed for some shady competitive sabotaging. By requiring people to show themselves, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time. <p> On one token, the change made it more difficult for reviews to be faked. Plus, because people 's names will be displayed, it will most likely decrease the amount of flaming tirades against your business. However, now it will be more difficult for people to leave a review, which also affects positive reviews in the same way. So, some users wo n't want to create an account just to leave a positive review and will opt to pass. <p> The best way to combat this barrier to leaving a review is to educate your customers on both the process of leaving a review and the importance of your business getting good reviews on Google+ Local.
