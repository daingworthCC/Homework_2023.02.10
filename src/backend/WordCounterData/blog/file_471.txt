5155441 <h> How To Come Up With That " I Could Have Thought Of That " Idea <p> How many times have you caught yourself staring at a brilliant product on TV or in person that you use in your everyday life and sorrowfully thought to yourself " I could have come up with that!? " <p> It happens to all of us, and we all feel like idiots after the fact because sometimes the concept of this nature is truly so simple that anyone really could have thought of it. This is why the only difference between you and the person that did think of it is the boundaries you place on yourself that prevent you from being as open minded and creative as the product 's inventor. <p> Of course, that idea that you tell yourself you could have thought of was most likely a multi-million dollar innovation. But it 's not the amount of money generated from this creation that makes it so brilliant. All of the most successful inventions have come from someone taking a simple idea and going to extraordinary lengths to bring it to life. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and satisfaction from knowing one is sharing his or her vision with the rest of the world have no monetary value whatsoever. Here is how you can finally come up with your own " I could have thought of that " idea so other people, not you, will be wishing they put in the work to make their dreams a reality. <p> You do n't need to have a 100-person company to develop and execute a good idea. - Larry Page( Google) <p> 10. Find what frustrates you <p> Look for the things that annoy you, are hard to use and piss you off every time you touch it because you just know it 's such a piece of crap. Ideas come into fruition when there is a void in something that eventually gets filled by a solution that adds a new level of futuristic convenience. <p> 9. See what frustrates others <p> Now that you have found what annoys you, it 's time to pay attention to other people as well because you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they use the product you are about to alter or replace. Simply ask them what they would think of your plan and keep a journal with all the reactions. <p> 8. Build your team <p> At this point, if you believe in your idea and you believe in yourself without any self doubt, it 's time to start putting your team together. Your team is your backbone because each member will tackle a different obstacle in the way of you reaching your goal. <p> Surround yourself with like minded individuals who have the work ethic and aspirations as you because they will inspire you to take your vision to entirely different levels. You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with. <p> 7. Put the pieces together <p> You do n't have to reinvent the wheel, but at least put a rim on it. Think about it like this : Youtube 's creators did n't create flash, or invent digital cameras that can catch any computer-ready video. All they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't create fast internet, web hosting or the concept of embedding but what they did do was combine all of those aspects to invent a new resource that was incredibly easy to use. <p> 6. Test variations of the same idea <p> You would be surprised to find that your original idea might not be anywhere near as good as its modified version because the variation is more efficient and appeals to an even larger market. Think about the iPhone and the iPad. They are basically built off of the same, simplifying concept but are two different products that serve two different purposes. <p> 5. Fall in love with your idea <p> Money should never ever be your end goal because it is way too easy to fail in that regard. You need to fall in love with your idea, you need to eat, breathe and live your idea 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 365 days. When you really love your idea, it wo n't even feel like you are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to be healthy. Your goals should have more meaning than just making money. Your goal should be to change the world. <p> Sit with a blank sheet of paper in total silence for an hour, with " what is my purpose? " at the top and see what happens. Enthusiasm is the blood of creativity. Big ideas blossom when you 're passionate and enthusiastic about what you 're doing. <p> 4. Keep it simple, stupid <p> You are not the next Steve Jobs just yet so you should keep yourself humble and grounded. Do n't ever over complicate a good idea. Business marketing studies have shown that the more product choices were offered, the less products consumers typically buy. Your idea is just the foundation to what you will eventually build. <p> Richard Branson launched Virgin Records in 1973, and he is currently selling tickets to go to space on Virgin Galactic. This all started after he opened up a small record shop on Oxford Street about forty years ago. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times have we come across people with great ideas who never managed to do anything with them because they thought they did n't have the resources to make it happen. <p> If that ever crosses your mind, think about how Stevie Wonder 's blindness put such a unique feel on the music he created, and 25 Grammy 's later he proved to everyone how not having the necessary resources might not be a bad thing at all. If you pursue a new venture that involves leveraging your resources and skills, you 're already ahead of the game. <p> 2. Take constructive criticism but ignore the naysayers <p> Remember, there are always going to be haters and you should welcome their feedback because it is a sign that you are doing something right by bringing upon a potential change in people 's lives. <p> It does n't matter how many people hate your idea if enough people love it in return. Take in only constructive criticism that could help your chances for success and apply for further experimentation. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about executing to the utmost of your potential. Take a look at Google for example. Their idea was not at all revolutionary since there were already various search engines available such as Yahoo, AOL and MSN. What they did was find a void in what already existed before creating a better product and executing their idea before someone else would. <p> They worked hard and had more sleepless nights that you can imagine but have turned their simple idea of a search engine into a global powerhouse that our everyday lives depend on. Remember, it 's not the ideas themselves that count, it 's what you do with them. With the right execution, a simple idea can evolve into many dumfounded people saying " I could have thought of that! " and that 's the day you smile. <p> Some of the greatest ideas died with the people who were too afraid to move forward with their vision and believe in their own abilities. What we have now is so much mediocrity surrounding us because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea can change the world if the character
