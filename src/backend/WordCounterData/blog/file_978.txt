If a gay man made racist comments along the same lines( " Man, if your kid starts talking all ghetto, beat the shit out of him " would be a parallel), I have no doubt that most people would find that highly offensive and he would be punished. And I doubt the LGBT community would think it had to do with the person 's sexuality so much as their inflammatory words. <p> I will say, though, that Jacquie Hood Martin 's tweet reminds me strongly of the very unfortunate comment Dan Savage made after Prop 8 was passed, which was also very " us vs. them. "( I was critical of that at the time, as were many others.) <p> As I told Mrs. Martin and Ms. Nelson, the only us vs. them is non-bigots vs. bigots, not blacks vs. gays ; and need they be reminded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad statement that Mrs. Martin thinks gay people have used black history to get our rights -- first, it implies we do n't deserve them ; second, it overlooks the fact that many, many gay people( not only black ones) were deeply invested in the black civil rights struggle. <p> Ca n't we all get along? Maybe we can, but it 's so dispiriting that all it takes is something relatively minor like some unacceptable tweets to expose deep resentments. <p> P.S. Worst irony of all : Some black supporters of Martin decrying that " #PCSucks " and mentioning that " acronym activist " groups like PETA and GLAAD are the real bullies. Sounds exactly like what right-wingers say when attacking the NAACP. <p> Reframing this as a race issue is pretty low.
