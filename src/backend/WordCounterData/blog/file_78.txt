5115841 <p> Never enough time, never enough energy, never enough laughter, never enough love... trying to capture the memories in the middle of the madness! <h> Monday, November 15, 2010 <h> One of those things... <p> This blog has become one of those things... you know the things you think about at the end of the day, the little side chores that you keep putting off because they are n't that important.

Thanks for the laughs and the tears and putting up with my insanity! I 'll still be around, going through all the same old stuff.... just a little more quietly, <h> 1 comment : <h> Jeremy <p> My fantastic husband ; I could n't pick anyone better to share the moments of my life, good and bad. <h> Kadin <p> My little monkey... he makes me laugh, he makes me cry, and I love him to pieces!! <h> Kylee <p> This little girl has plenty of personality and attitude ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family <p> Life is pretty darn great in our little family of four! We certainly have our ups and downs like anyone else, but we celebrate every joy and learn from every challenge together. I am
