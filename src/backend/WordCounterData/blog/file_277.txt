5135841 <h> Largest Catalog Ever of Center of the Milky Way <p> This striking view of the central parts of the Milky Way was obtained with the VISTA survey telescope at ESO 's Paranal Observatory in Chile. It was created by combining thousands of individual images from VISTA, taken through three different infrared filters, into a single monumental mosaic. Credit : ESO/VVV Consortium, Acknowledgement : Ignacio Toledo, Martin Kornmesser <p> An international team of astronomers created a catalog of more than 84 million stars in the central parts of the Milky Way using a nine-gigapixel image from the VISTA infrared survey telescope at ESO 's Paranal Observatory. <p> This gigantic dataset contains more than ten times more stars than previous studies and is a major step forward for the understanding of our home galaxy. The image gives viewers an incredible, zoomable view of the central part of our galaxy. It is so large that, if printed with the resolution of a typical book, it would be 9 meters long and 7 meters tall. <p> " By observing in detail the myriads of stars surrounding the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation and evolution of not only our galaxy, but also spiral galaxies in general, " explains Roberto Saito( Pontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile, Universidad de Valparaso and The Milky Way Millennium Nucleus, Chile), lead author of the study. <p> Most spiral galaxies, including our home galaxy the Milky Way, have a large concentration of ancient stars surrounding the center that astronomers call the bulge. Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way 's bulge is vital for understanding the galaxy as a whole. However, obtaining detailed observations of this region is not an easy task. <p> The large mirror, wide field of view and very sensitive infrared detectors of ESO 's 4.1-metre Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy( VISTA) make it by far the best tool for this job. The team of astronomers is using data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea program( VVV) 1, one of six public surveys carried out with VISTA. The data have been used to create a monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine billion pixels. This is one of the biggest astronomical images ever produced. The team has now used these data to compile the largest catalog of the central concentration of stars in the Milky Way ever created 2. <p> To help analyze this huge catalog the brightness of each star is plotted against its color for about 84 million stars to create a color -- magnitude diagram. This plot contains more than ten times more stars than any previous study and it is the first time that this has been done for the entire bulge. Color -- magnitude diagrams are very valuable tools that are often used by astronomers to study the different physical properties of stars such as their temperatures, masses and ages 3. <p> This very wide-field view of the Milky Way shows the extent of the new VISTA infrared image of the center of the galaxy. These data cover the region known as the bulge of the galaxy and have been used to study a much larger number of individual stars in the central parts of the Milky Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VISTA mosaic is shown as a rectangle.

Since the new data gives us a snapshot of all the stars in one go, we can now make a census of all the stars in this part of the Milky Way, " explains Dante Minniti. <p> The new color -- magnitude diagram of the bulge contains a treasure trove of information about the structure and content of the Milky Way. One interesting result revealed in the new data is the large number of faint red dwarf stars. These are prime candidates around which to search for small exoplanets using the transit method 4. <p> " One of the other great things about the VVV survey is that it 's one of the ESO VISTA public surveys. This means that we 're making all the data publicly available through the ESO data archive, so we expect many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " concludes Roberto Saito. <p> This pan video gives a closer look at a huge new image of the central parts of the Milky Way made by combining thousands of images from ESO 's VISTA telescope on Paranal in Chile and compares it with the view in visible light. These infrared data, which come from the VVV public survey, have been used to study a much larger number of individual stars in the central parts of the Milky Way than ever before. Because VISTA has a camera sensitive to infrared light it can see through much of the dust blocking the view in visible light, although many more opaque dust filaments still show up well in this picture.

It started in 2010 and was granted a total of 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lactea is the Latin name for the Milky Way. <p> 2 The image used in this work covers about 315 square degrees of the sky( a bit less than 1% of the entire sky) and observations were carried out using three different infrared filters. The catalog lists the positions of the stars along with their measured brightnesses through the different filters. It contains about 173 million objects, of which about 84 million have been confirmed as stars. The other objects were either too faint or blended with their neighbors or affected by other artefacts, so that accurate measurements were not possible. Others were extended objects such as distant galaxies. <p> The image used here required a huge amount of data processing, which was performed by Ignacio Toledo at the ALMA OSF. It corresponds to a pixel scale of 0.6 arcseconds per pixel, down-sampled from the original pixel scale of 0.34 arcseconds per pixel. <p> 3 A color -- magnitude diagram is a graph that plots the apparent brightnesses of a set of objects against their colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look through different filters. It is similar to a Hertzsprung-Russell( HR) diagram but the latter plots luminosity( or absolute magnitude) rather than just apparent brightness and a knowledge of the distances of the stars plotted is also needed. <p> 4 The transit method for finding planets searches for the small drop in brightness of a star that occurs when a planet passes in front of it and blocks some of its light. The small size of the red dwarf stars, typically with spectral types K and M, gives a greater relative drop in brightness when low-mass planets pass in front of
