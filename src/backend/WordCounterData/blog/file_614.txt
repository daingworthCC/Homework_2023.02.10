5169841 <h> Chris Harris Pits the BMW M135i Against the Audi RS3 <p> Everyone 's favorite automotive video reviewer Chris Harris had some time with both the Audi RS3 and the new BMW M135i and discovered something. Something we 've known since Michael had a chance to spend some time with one in Germany earlier this year ; it 's a cracking little car that harkens back to the simple thrills of the E30 M3 and the 1M. So how does it compare with Audi 's more expensive RS3? Click through to find out. <p> Oh did we mention Drive is back for another season on Youtube? Go check it out now. <h> Share this : <p> The 5 door M135i is on my short list... this car is the real deal for real world fun without the huge adder of a full on M to the price. By no means is it as sorted as the 1M or the M3 but it is a hoot and will meet the needs of almost everyone... <p> Dr Obnxs <p> I just wish BMW would bring cars like this here.... <p> BimmerFileMichael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, BMW AG was willing to build the car to US specs for homologation purposes and BMWNA declined the offer. <p> There are some rumors circulating that there is a 2 series gran coupe in the works and possibly a 1 series based sedan approximating the size of the E46 being presented. <p> We are supposed to pickup our 120d 5 door in the next week or so, and I am quite happy about it. <p> I can either get a 2009 M3 sedan, a 2008 M5 E61 wagon or a 2013 M135i 5 door for roughly the same amount of money right now... I may just hold out to spring though and drive the Clubman a bit more. <p> http : **35;971;TOOLONG... Mark Smith <p> Bottom line for me? One bad a## BMW! I would grab one and drive the tires off of it. <p> lavardera <p> Seems like Harris in the BMW made a late start, and still managed to catch and pass the Audi.
