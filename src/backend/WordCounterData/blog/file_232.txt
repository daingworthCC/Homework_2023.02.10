5131441 <h> Houston Rockets vs. Portland Trail Blazers game preview <p> Once again, the NBA gives the Rockets an opponent with more rest than them. This is getting a bit ridiculous. However, this is the NBA, where you suck it up since you 're being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars( at minimum). Someone tell Royce White. <p> The Blazers beat the Lakers in their opening game at home when the Lakers were coming off a game the night before. They also beat the Rockets in OT, and on Tuesday they blew out the Kings. <p> However, they lost to the Mavs, Clippers, Spurs, and Hawks in an 8-day span. When you look at it, that 's a pretty tough opening slate of games that the Blazers have had. <p> The Blazers are another under-the-radar Western Conference team, but anytime you have the starters they have, there 's going to be a good team there. Outside of Hickson, it 's probably one of the best starting 5s in the league. And Hickson is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a tough pick between Lillard and Anthony Davis for Rookie of the Year. Lillard is averaging 18/7 and has basically just been a beast for the Blazers. I liked what I saw of Lillard at Weber State( which was n't much), but I did n't think he 'd be this good. <p> I feel like I say that kind of thing a lot. <p> Anyway, you guys know I love you, but to those clamoring for Douglas to start and Lin to come off the bench : please stop. That 's just ridiculous. <p> It 's got ta be all business for Harden tonight. Last time these teams met, Mattews and Batum gave him all he could handle and effectively shut him down. <p> Waitress : For one? Carter : No, for two, I 'm here for a meeting with Mr. Juntao. Waitress : I 'm sorry I do not know Mr. Juntao. Carter : Look maybe you do n't understand, I 'm Mr. Juntao 's lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he told me to come down here and I 'm a very busy man, ai n't got time to be down here this late but I 'm down here, my wife want me to come home, my baby is shittin ' all over the house, he needs diapers, would you please go get Mr. Juntao? <p> Just like with Prince, Parsons faces his ceiling tonight. Batum is better slasher and shooter than Parsons, which are things our Emo Prince will have to learn. <p> Batum will spend plenty of time on Harden, meaning that Parsons can have some 1-on-1 advantages if he wants it. He 's also going to get plenty of open threes off of rotations. He 's got to hit the big ones. <p> Aldridge had surgery before the end of last season and missed the offseason. He 's still rounding into shape so the Rockets are getting him at less than 100%. <p> On the other hand, he will get to the line, where he converts a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to demand a trade to the Rockets for Royce White, I 'm just going to say that I 'm a huge LMA fan. <p> Asik has found his offense, and that 's exactly what the Rockets needed. When your defensive-minded center is making six shots in a game, it 's either really bad, or it 's great because he 's getting easy looks. <p> Against the Hornets, it was the
