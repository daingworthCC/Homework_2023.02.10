5132841 <p> THEIR IS ONE BIG PROBLEM -- others want your water and without special forces, you will continue to lose your assets. I have made this quite clear for 30 years and the same problem exists today ; you have no staff that sees the business dimension and economic value of water and no vision to do so. <p> Maximizing the value of your assets and adding value is not their priority.... IT MUST BECOME SO, using the best of the best people available. Your trustee must be focused on the future, not the past. <p> When you find yourself in a very deep hole, stop digging... It is very odd that IID has gained massive liability the past 12 years and losses that will continue for decades -- the architect of QSA is the dream team lead by a bankruptcy specialist????? what a paradox... and this deathly position cost you 130 million???? is one million pages???? IS IT TIME FOR CHANGE??? <p> What is wrong with this picture... : selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 per af when cost to conserve may be over $500 per af with no cost protection and the marginal cost of new water is $2340 per af and rising rapidly to four to six thousand per acre foot.... will go down as one of the most profoundly bad- mistaken economic miss-prices in the history book.

What do we want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all water matters. Objective is a fair bargain an honest business deal. As is the valley can only lose. CHANGE and EVOLVE MUST BE KEY CONCEPTS. <p> 2. How will we do it? Utilize sound and advanced concepts( water bank-drought insurance) to protect our water and create value -- doing good for others and very well for ourselves. Knowledge backed NEGOTIATION. <p> We will first maximize the value of your assets while protecting them from dysfunctional QSA damage. <p> We will change the very negative current image to a dynamic and universally accepted David vs Goliath struggle. We will create a new platform for business like profitable transactions and fair dealing. We will create teamwork amount the best professionals and follow the historical rule of water rights : HE WHO HAS THE WATER MAKES THE RULES.... <p> I have studied investments all my life. Never have I seen a greater opportunity than that which exists in the Imperial Valley. I have put your interests ahead of mine by providing insights that would create value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it time we worked together as a team to provide a 11-7 action plan for opportunity? <p> If not now, when? <p> " In times of great change, Learners will inherit the earth( and water rights), while the Learned will be beautifully equipped for a
