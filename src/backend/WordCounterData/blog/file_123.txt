5120341 <p> Many people use acetaminophen daily to help with aches, pains, fevers, arthritis, and symptoms that come with common colds. Users of acetaminophen may exceed the recommended dosage instruction not knowing the possible side effects of this medicine. The purpose of this study was to show the effects of taking too much acetaminophen has on the liver and what may possibly help reduce these risks. These studies are usually conducted on rats, so scientists are able to have control groups, control their surroundings easily, and control dosages administered to the animals. <p> Summary and Procedure <p> In this study, rats were given 500-1500 milligrams of acetaminophen( APAP) per kilogram of body weight intrgastrically. The scientists wanted to find ways to prevent liver damage, so they hypothesized that tryptophan derivatives, melatonin, and **26;7593;TOOLONG( NNT) might help stop the harmful side effects. These are believed to be hepatoprotectors, which are substances that help prevent damage to the liver. Acetaminophen was used because it is one of the most commonly used drugs to conduct chemically driven liver damage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rats were exposed to light for twelve hours and followed by a twelve hour period of darkness for one week. The animals were divided into five groups which were control, APAP, APAP+NNT( **26;7621;TOOLONG), APAP+Melatonin, and NNT. Each rat in the groups APAP, APAP+NNT, and APAP+Melatonin was given 1500 mg/kg of body weight of acetaminophen intragastrically. After 4 and 6 hours the groups APAP+NNT and NNT were given intraperitoneal injections of NNT at 2 mg/ kg of body weight. The group APAP+Melatonin also received intaoperitoneal injections of melatonin at 10 mg/kg of body weight. Approximately 24 hours after the injections and dosages were administered, the rats were decapitated and blood and liver tissue samples were prepared for analysis and study. <p> Tables and Trends <p> The general trend of Figure 1 shows that as Acetaminophen dosage increases, the mitochondrial protein drastically decreases by two-thirds. The second part of the chart shows that as APAP is increased, the postmitochondrial fraction decreases by almost half. The second chart shows the alanine aminotransferase( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilirubin in blood plasma. The control group showed the lowest levels of ALT, AST, and bilirubin. The only section that has more ALT than AST is the APAP group. In the APAP+NNT and APAP+Melatonin groups, the AST and ALT are equivalent. The NNT group has the second lowest amount of AST, ALT, and bilirubin. Table 1 shows that there was not a decrease in the activity of liver enzymes in the mitochondria, but there was an increase in succinate dehydrogenase. Table 2 shows that there was not a large decrease in protein SH groups in the postmitochondrial fraction, but the glutathione( GSH) decreased by almost 45%. GSH, a main antioxidant in the body, helps the body detoxify itself. Once GSH is decreased dramatically, it causes the person or animal 's immune system to weaken, therefore increasing the risk of infection. <p> Conclusion <p> In conclusion, studies from the table show that **26;7649;TOOLONG was best in stopping elevated levels of ALT, AST, and bilirubin. By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver. When a liver blood test is done, elevated levels in ALT and AST signify that there is evidence of liver damage. When bilirubin levels were increased in the blood stream, it indicated that medictions, such as acetaminophen, had been taken causing drainage ducts in the liver to be blocked and leak bilirubin. There may be better ways to take acetaminophen, so that it may bypass the liver causing less harmful side effects. Research would need to be conducted to make sure it would not cause harm to other organs. Acetaminophen has many positive uses when taken properly and in the right dosage. People need to be aware of the harmful side effects when APAP is taken in too high of a dosage and too frequently. Studies need to be done with different other possible hepatoprotectors, such as combining melatonin, NNT, and N-acetyl-cysteine. Studies have been done showing that some of these reduce APAP hepatoxicity, so if combined, these effects may be decreased. The experiment was valid, and each step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only possible problems might include the drugs used were not left in the rats for a long enough time to see other possible side effects. Other studies derived from this experiment could test
