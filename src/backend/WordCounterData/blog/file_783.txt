5187141 <p> I was on Mark Thompson 's Make It Plain XM Sirius show Wednesday night, and we 'd been talking about what it was like, having to use the emergency room for medical care. So this guy from Alabama calls in with a question : " I have a small business, and I have to bust my hump to pay for medical insurance. People are n't entitled to medical care. Why should you get something for free when I have to work hard to pay for it? " <p> I do n't know why( because it 's not as if I do n't know a lot of people agree with him), but I was taken aback. " So your position is that I should have just died. " <p> " People are n't entitled to health care. " <p> Then he went on to say that he 'd recently been in the ER, " and everyone in there was on the dole. " <p> I asked him how he knew that. I know that confidentiality rules are such that you 're not sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting there talking to all of them, and they told me. " <p> " So every single person in there told you they were on the dole? " <p> Mark made a comment that he doubted that, and hung up on the caller. But when I was done with my segment, I kept thinking about it. So things are so bad in this country that people begrudge emergency treatment to the sick? Now, he was calling from Alabama, and it is one of our poorest states. So I looked it up. <p> In 2010, Medicaid, Medicare and ALL Kids( Alabama 's Children 's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP) covered 19 percent of Alabamians under age 65, including 45 percent of children under age 19( Table 2-2). <p> With fewer avenues to qualify for Medicaid, adults under age 65 were much less likely than children to have public coverage, even at very low levels of income. In households below the federal poverty level, 25 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 82 percent of children. <p> These are really poor people, and yet he simply does n't care. He works hard, why should they get something he has to pay for? <p> Because we pay for all kinds of things meant for the common good. I do n't have kids in school anymore, but I do n't begrudge money for public education. My parents are both dead, but I do n't begrudge paying for the Medicaid your parents might need for a nursing home. My kids are healthy and strong, but I do n't begrudge paying for the disability services that help people who are n't. It 's the right thing to do. <p> We do these things because that 's what civilized, decent people do. Because the way we treat our most vulnerable and needy says who we are as a nation. And because the caller was from Alabama, which is part of the Bible Belt, I thought of the story of the prodigal son : <p> And he answering said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends : <p> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. <p> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. <p> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad : for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again ; and was lost, and is found. <p> This story is n't just about a jealous brother, it 's about compassion. Compassion is n't something that 's earned. If it has to be earned, it is n't compassion. It 's reduced to a transaction. <p> The caller is correct. Why should I pay for the wellness of others that share my breathing space? I do n't live in a bubble, so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for medical care so I might as well pay even more because others pass on illnesses to me. In the short run I will pay more and in the long run I will pay more. Why should you get health care when I have to pay more when you do n't get it? <p> This thing was really brought home to me when the undocumented woman who lives next door came down with TB. Should we deny her care? Sure my family would get exposed to TB, but she 'd be getting something for free if she goes to the hospital! Damn it bring on the plague! <p> Why is he paying for health care. Why not go on the " dole " and get the free stuff? My guess is that he makes toooo much money. Soooo he begrudges people life-saving health care because they are n't fortunate enough to make as much money as he does.. <p> I had to explain to him that he ALREADY IS paying for people w/o insurance when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expensive care there is. So at least now they 'll have insurance and can get regular care... " which SAVES YOU MONEY! " <p> * There are two types of Republicans : millionaires and suckers. " Mugsy 's Rap Sheet " : Recording history for those who seek to rewrite it. <p> " Why should you get something for free when I have to work hard to pay for it? " <p> Not sentence more fully captures the core of teabaggerism. These are people who stay awake at night with the terrifying thought that their taxes are being spent for the benefit of someone else. And thanks to Romney 's latest flipflop, the current meme out there is that ER 's are just meccas for free health care. <p> Of course, the reality is, if you ca n't afford to pay, the hospital does n't just throw their hands up and say, " Oh well ". They send you a bill. And if you still ca n't pay, they 'll refer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect on the bill. Depending on the circumstances, they can ruin your credit rating or even drive you into bankruptcy. <p> I wish more people would point this out. I have a friend that I spoke to about 8 months ago and he was doing very well. He had just started a new job as a bank teller. He had gotten a small inheritance and use the money to put a down payment on a condo. Everything was looking up but he had no health insurance. I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and he had been in an accident. A deer had run across the road in front of him and he lost control of his pickup and rolled it. He was n't badly hurt but needed 8 stitches and had some bruising. Between the ambulance ride to the hospital, emergency room aid, and the towing and storage of his pickup, he owed about $20,000. He wound up losing everything he had built. He is even now but emergency rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head and keep you down. <p> Why should anybody be paying for health care! Why do we not move toward optimal health with preventative and free health care for everyone. Health is not a commodity you shop for and buy off the friggin shelf! Why not encourage healthy living and not kowtow to such corporations as in the tobacco industry that strive for ill health by use of their products. <p> Recovered believer of myth that no government is better than no government. <p> Okay nobody pays, how many Drs. nurses, pharmacists, radiographers, pharmacists, chemists that create the new drugs, engineers that design the latest med tech, the people who make all of it, etc are going to work for free? And if they are all working for free who is going to pay for their schooling, food, homes? Or should that be free also? Then who pays for the teachers, buildings, books, etc? <p> that was n't at the heart of the issue. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't imply otherwise. the question is, how, and how much? as it is, the cost of health care in this country is wildly overinflated, by comparison to every other civilized country in the world. according the World Health Organization, per person expenditures on health care in the US are more than double than those of the next highest country, for similar or worse average outcomes. that 's a lot of wasted cash my friend. worse yet, you and i are helping foot the bill for the pharmeceutical companies ' ginormous profits, by funding the bulk of the R &D; for new drugs, which they profit off of. we also fund the bulk of every doctor 's medical school education, with our tax dollars. they owe me a free heart transplant. perhaps you 'd like a nice, fresh new liver? <p> sorry to shoot down your strawman, but the actual issue is, should someone be deprived of needed healthcare, simply because they lack the funds or insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human right. the caller says no, it is n't, they should die on the street, so as not to inconvenience him. i 'm betting he is n't going to volunteer to help clean up the mess left behind though. <p> it 's not a basic human right also. Anything you have to force someone to provide for yourself is not something you are entitled to. Food is needed for life, should farmers have to provide food for those that ca n't afford it? If you say yes, you are advocating slavery. Same as if you advocate that others that can afford it, are forced to pay the farmers for those that ca n't. <p> that the U.S. is so freakin far down the ranks of " civilized " or 1st world countries when it comes to looking after its ' citizens? Even educating them? Unless of course they are in jail... then you guys rocket to #1 on the planet. <p> Are you talking about socialized healthcare paid for through taxes? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working americans pay 0 federal income tax. And last I checked about 40% received a " refund " of more than they paid in. <p> than just sling insults. Why not try to explain your point of view? What do you consider a tiny amount of money? And I 'm not stupid, nor a fascist. And personally I do n't care what you think about my Mother. <p>.. is that because he has enough wealth and income to purchase affordable health insurance and assure himself of decent health care, he 's essentially getting the same kind of " free " health care that he assumes poorer working folk are getting. Except, that the poorer folk will be getting nothing less than total grief from bill collectors and wage garnishers for their inability to pay the bill for their " free " health care, beause whatever " dole " they do get is guaranteed to never be even close enough to cover the expenses. <p> And... what 's to say that many of those " freeloaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making enough out of their work to afford genuine health care?? <p> If anything, it 's Tea Party Caller who is the real freeloader, because he benefits directly from the deferred wages and unpaid work of the working poor who are overworked and underpaid, and from the taxes collected from them to cover his own insurance and keep prices down to the bottom. <p> I have a better solution : How about that NO ONE should have to work for decent, affordable health care, or that those who do work should be compensated with enough of a livable decent wage with enough benefits so that we can we can expand affordable health care to all?? <p> I work full time but do n't have a job that offers health care benefits( although fortunately, that may change soon). I make too much to be eligible for many of the programs for low-income people, but not nearly enough to pay for insurance each month. I 've been living in fear of getting sick for quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy( or at least to my knowledge because I do n't get check-ups or preventative care). Am I one of those freeloaders to that guy( or to the Tea Party avatar person below)? Health care tied to employment is a losing proposition for many of us, and in hard economic times simply switching jobs is n't feasible. <p> Also, would n't ER care be better for everyone if it was n't the last resort for so many people? Does he really want a society where we step over the bodies of people dying in the street? How can he be so damn sure he would n't be one of those poor people one day? <p> Amazing answer there by Sam Seder. For some reason republicans just will not listen to reason on this one issue. Ok, maybe its more than this issue. But can someone tell me what on earth is up with the closed captions guy? Eureka??? <p> Wow, there 's so much here that just sucks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't matter if everyone in that room was or was not actually on the dole. Asking " how do you know " is completely off topic and juvenile. The caller thinks it 's true and the host was not there, so why choose to fight him on " facts " that you do n't have? Secondly, paying for health insurance is not the same as requiring emergency treatment. One way insurance is suppose to help by allowing you to seek preventative care so that minor issues do n't escalate to ER treatments. While there are many arguments to be made about the efficiency of our current insurance system and how they are likely gauging insurance purchasers, we should at least be able to discuss the supposed intent of purchasing insurance correctly. The only way that progressives have a chance to sway people is by being rational and factual. Even with facts it may not make a lick of difference in changing minds. But assuming that the since the caller is from the south and fashioning an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointless waste of time. <p> asking how he knows is perfectly legitimate, how does he know? he claims he asked everyone else who was there, and they all said they were on the " dole ". that was a dead giveaway right there : what person, born after wwII, uses the term " dole " for welfare? um, no one, not in the US anyway. so, i 'm guessing this caller is a big, fat, lying blowhard, possibly even a campaign stunt by the romney/ryan people. just too much suspicious going on here. the only way to find out is to ask. <p> you are correct about one purpose of health insurance : to provide the means to treat illnesses, before they reach the ER stage. why you think it would be important to explain that to the caller baffles me, because it 's irrelevant to the issue at hand : his desire to ensure that no one gets " something for nothing ", since he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions were made regarding the caller 's religious beliefs, just that he was calling from the heart of the bible belt, which was made very clear in the post. go back and re-read it. <p> The point is that the host has made the assumption that everyone in the ER at that time could not have possibly been on the dole by assuming the caller was making a generality to bolster his statement. But it is possible that everyone in that room could have been unemployed, or receiving some sort of government assistance. Now both you and the host have ruled it impossible based on assumptions, but it is very possible. So why choose that particualr point? There are no facts to back your assumption and it does nothing to further the conversation. As for reading for comprehension, I think I got that one.. at least this time. My point was directed to the author and others not assume that just because someone is from the " Bible-belt " that they are susceptible to any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a private affair and I tailor my speech with that in mind. It is simply unwise to assume to know another 's beliefs because of the the region they hail( or a particular phrase they use). The author has used assumptions to bolster the blog post and imply that anyone from the bible belt who speaks thusly about health care must be a hypocrite because of the story of prodigal son. OK, maybe the author did n't mean to imply the caller was a hypocrite but, judging by more than a few of the comments, that was the message received and people are running with it. Finally, I use the term phrase " on the dole " all the time. It 's colorful and rather fun to say, and I was born more than a few decades after WWII. Again, those pesky assumptions. <p> diseases can get him too, if not treated), i 'm guessing he also supported the government 's( under bros. george &; jeb) intrusion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her, in spite of her specific wishes to the contrary. i believe her husband basically told the hospital to blow itself, he was n't paying for the treatment. <p> people like your caller are the modern-day version of the puritans, worried that somewhere, some pathetically poor person is getting something they did n't pay for. while i appreciate his irritation at the cost of his health insurance, the ACA should actually help reduce that. better yet, single-payer would be the most economically viable route to health care delivery, relieving hospitals and individual practices from the burden of administering umpteen dozen different health insurance plans, knowing they 'll get paid, and can go back to focusing on their patient 's health instead. <p> " Yet he simply does n't care? " That 's right, not only do they not care, they hate, The Reich wing propaganda machine( Fox and Limbaugh) have the got the pea brained ignoramuses vilifying people who are in need, people who are having a tough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? The hungry? " That 's what dumpsters are for! "( Rush Limbaugh). <p> The insurance industry racketeers, the Wall Street investors, the leeches, they just love that caller... and those like him. Dumb as a box of rocks objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all. " <p> for my medical care, because I had to wait until I was an ER case to get treatment. What could have been handled for say $5-10000 in early stages and would have left me able to continue to work and contribute and pay my own way ended up costing 100s of thousands--perhaps even a million. Not only does this moron now pay for my medical, he pays for my housing through HUD and my food through the food stamp program, and he helps pay my SSDI monthly payments. <p> No one knows how many people die a year in this country due to lack of medical care, the last studies done are over 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninsured and higher rates of death. <p> It 's way more expensive to treat illness than it is to prevent it. And we 'll twist on the the vine with this privatised bullshit as long as stupid shits like the caller from AL keep getting their way with this lying bullshit.. That is MUCH more expensive. <p> BTW, the other tax-paying states actually support his shitty little corner of hell. Why should I pay for this asshole 's federal highway? I 'm never going to use it. <p> System( now called Interstates). Further, this applies only to the interstate system. Not the " US Highways " which are also federally subsidized. You can hardly argue that is the primary or even secondary purpose today. Thanks for playing. The only time the US military would ever need to use the interstate system today in any kind of grand scale would be in the event of a civil war. <p> File that line under bullpuckey. Doctors may. Hospitals, give me an effing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for services ALREADY rendered through the ER so that they do n't have sue you for the money. However, you are n't going to sell anyone on the notion that if you need major surgery that a hospital will set up a payment plan in advance of them providing service. It may happen once in a blue moon in a community hospital in a small town or rural area, but that would be the exception rather than the rule. <p> and Drs offices I 've been in have a sign, If you can not pay at the time of service please make arrangements in advance. And what about the second half? Why should anyone else be responsible to pay for hers or anyone 's health care? <p> Why should anyone else be responsible to pay for hers or anyone 's health care? <p> Because it is the price of a free society. It also( depending on your belief system) the basis of morality( helping those who could not help themselves). The general welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed, and be expected to survive. At some point all of us must contribute in order to form a more perfect union( a better country). Sometimes, that means aiding others, even if you yourself see no immediate benefit. <p> Just thinking about what I would say to Tim about his attitude towards the poor and the uninsured might cause me to need blood pressure medication, and since I 'm disabled, I 'd be mooching, so, I suppose I will do nothing else but give you the praise you deserve! <p> " The greatest tyranny is censoring information in order to be better able to control people. " - Cristina Saralegui <p> If this country had socialised medicine when I first got ill, I would probably not even be on line. But thanks to people like you, with your false economy ideas, I 'm here today. And they 'll be paying for yours, too. And there 's your answer. Why should you pay for it? Because if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy for them. <p> answer as to why you feel that others should pay for your needs against their will? How is it any different than pointing a gun at someone and taking what they have? Or standing over them with a whip while they pick cotton for your gain? <p> No, the cost of a society is to support others who may be for whatever reason unable to support themselves. When social security was first enacted, it was to keep the elderly from being destitute. The reason being that a nation like the United States believing that it had something special going for it, and the general welfare of the populace, should take care of the needy and unfortunate. <p> As for people being greedy for healthcare, I notice that you put free in quotation marks. Are you admitting that it is n't free after all? That maybe it has a cost to society that could be reduce by something ACA? <p> free was in quotation marks because people talk about free healthcare when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> If you feel that is the cost of society, you are more than welcome to pay for those that can not. You are also more than welcome to find other like minded people to join up and help pay. What I feel is wrong is forcing others to pay for someone else needs. <p> Firefighters to put out the fire if your house should catch fire or police to help you if you are assaulted. Why should other people pay to school your children or build roads they do n't need but you do to go where you want to go. Or airports.or the air traffic control system. Or anything government does? You must be one of those despicable assholes who expect others to pay for what you need. Cause you did n't build any of those things did you? <p> would n't mind if people were allowed to opt out of police and fire protection and have their property taxes reduced by the percentage that goes towards them. I could even almost agree with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to opt out, your ca n't change your mind afterwards. And if you have had children in the system you ca n't opt out afterwards. Similar with roads sure you can opt out, but you can not use the roads, that also goes for having things delivered to you by them. And once you start using them.... <p> " first nation 's " folk when you opted out of circling with the other wagons. And chances are the survivors would have opted out of taking time to bury your ass on the prairie and let you compost in Kansas. <p> In mine and quite a few others, the general welfare clause is not one of the enumerated powers. It is one of the reasons for the enumerated powers. If that section were enumerated powers, none of the rest would of been needed. Why would there be a specific powers listed to declare war, raise an army and navy, when it 's allready listed that to provide for the common defense. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that fits in with the above is that the general welfare clause is actually just for taxation. But what they can spend the money on is only the other enumerated powers. " The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States ; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States ; " <p> Where does it state that they can spend money for healthcare or food for the people? It states they can tax it does n't mention anything about spend. But in the other enumerated powers it does state that they can raise an army and navy, create and maintain post roads etc. <p> ETA I misread your post at first. What you posted is actually what I just said but in a more concise way. It is the goal of the enumerated powers. It is n't one of the enumerated powers itself. <p> Hey Psychopath Moron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and give it all to rich assholes who pay no taxes, simply because those rich assholes buy corrupt politicians to do their theivery for them. <p> Nice try. <p> Why do n't you do yourself a favor, and STFU! <p> If I were a psychopath, I would join the republican party, and get in on the gravy train taking the Teabircher morons to the cleaners. <p> and attempting to shut up someone is a sign of a weak mind and no ability to form a reasoned response. You might try to actually argue your point rather than just insult. I know it may be tough for you, but you never know if you can until you try. <p> Suggesting health care and your health is not a basic right, means you are just a nasty, stupid, evil little clueless fuck, who tries to sound like your sick evil position is somehow relevant because you can spout some idiotic libertarian bullshit you think justifies the blackhearted un American sick opinions you hold. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican party, and get in on the gravy train taking the Teabircher morons to the cleaners. <p> stating is that it is n't someones right to force others to pay for their own needs and wants. <p> Is freedom of the press/speech a basic human right? If so do I have the right to force you to buy me a printing press, paper and ink along with paying for the electricity to run it? Or is it limited to what I can afford or get others to voluntarily pay for? <p> Kitty, I sorta get the sense I " know " you, by virtue of reading your comments for a couple years. Only recently did I learn of your life situation. I 'm recently on disability, and can only thank my lucky stars I live in the Communist haven of Canada. To have to " deal " with a cold system that frustrates your every move to get something simple accomplished only adds just that special layer of torture designed to test one 's mettle. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... and not just for the medical program... <p> be if his business went bankrupt due to another repub recession, and could not find employment. Would he then expect to get some free treatment for a life-treatening disease, or just commit suicide? This is the thinking behind a bumper sticker I saw yesterday, " Just Suffer. " Self-righteous folkks do n't think so far as to put themselves in others ' shoes, otherwise known as EMPATHY. <p> You ca n't possible expect anyone to have compassion for someone sitting in their section 8 housing dropping out ever more crotch goblins for the sole purpose of increasing their benefit check, as opposed to someone unable to work because of disability. The former are entitled to nothing more than they can beg for, not my hard-earned tax dollars. <p> As someone who used to work as an office manager for a management company that included some low income tenants, I can tell you that you have no idea how Section 8 works. Section 8 is rent assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All of our section 8 tenants worked at least 1 job. Many worked 2 or more. They did very little sitting around their housing. Most of them probably did more work at their crappy, thankless jobs in a day than you do in a week. <p> Be grateful that you are fortunate enough to not be facing their circumstance. <p> I hope you do n't have children. It is scary that someone as hateful and selfish as you might actually be charged with raising children to create more hateful, selfish, narrow-minded bigots. <p> Along with beg do n't forget steal. I ca n't understand why right wingers want to punish poor children just because their parents are useless. I want those ghetto kids and trailer trash educated and their needs taken care of so they do n't steal my stuff. <p> If you think people are going to sit around and starve to death or do without in the midst of the most affluent society the world has ever known you 're nuts. They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they have the education and tools to do so, or they will take it from you and me if they do n't have any other way. That 's humans baby. I 'll admit my support of programs for the poor is 90% self interest and 10% compassion. <p> We have had dozens of fund raisers in recent year 's for cancer patients, many who were children. Some cases their parent 's still worked but did n't have insurance, some cases they had their jobs shipped overseas, but very few if any do I remeber being in Housing - as if that makes any difference you stupid psychotic peice of rightwing shit. <p> Typical rightwing moron you are : Hearing some bullshit from the GOPer 's that does n't really exist, and even if it did, it would end up screwing way more innocent people than the made up case the GOP has you hating on. <p> Meanwhile, the GOP asshole 's that you listen to, all have government healthcare, and are the biggest welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer money before they finish their Monday morning coffee, than 100,000 taxpayers will get in their entire lives. <p> I really resent my hard earned dollars going to states that support fascists - as in nazi fascist republicans - and their braindead idiot supporters like you, who, in your hatred and stupidity, are trying desperately to destroy our country. <p> I have a much more prominent and valid list of " not wanting my tax dollars spent on " GOP bullshit and corporate fascism, than you will ever have about the poor or homeless. <p> So STFU you ignorant jackass! <p> You are a vile, disgusting, anti american fascist dupe, and you represent everything - including the stupidity of fascists ' dupes - that is wrong with this country. <p> Despite that, I would wholeheartledly demand health care for you under any circumstance, regardless of how repugnant you are as a person. But that 's what seperates real American 's and real human beings from the Teabagger turds of our society. <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party, and get in on the gravy train taking the Teabircher morons to the cleaners. <p> Furthermore, these goobers do n't seem to understand the concept of " insurance. " Insurance works because somebody who is n't sick is paying for somebody who is, that 's just the fact of it. <p> If John Q. Cracker in Alabammy has insurance, his hard earned money is already paying for those who are using his precious insurance benefits when he is n't. That 's the real benefit of single payer - you 've got the absolute largest pool of rate payers you can possibly get, and when there are that many that are well, the few who are sick are just a blip on the radar. <p> Since the Reagan era, the lesson of the right wing has been : Compassion is for suckers. And for a lot of people, that suits their own bigotry to a tee : I am good, I have stuff. They are bad, they are poor. If you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they know they 're better than those lazy bums? <p> Actually, if you 're going to bring up Bible verses, a better choice is Matthew 25:31-46, the one that includes : <p> 34 " Then the King will say to those on his right, ' Come, you who are blessed by my Father ; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you the creation of the world. 35 For I eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. ' <p> 37 " Then the righteous will answer him, ' Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> 40 " The reply, ' Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me. ' <p> " These are really poor people, and yet he simply does n't care. He works hard, why should they get something he has to pay for? " <p> There it is. It 's not that these asshats are opposed to these so called " entitlements ", per se. it 's that it pisses them off that someone else, especially someone not like them, might be getting something that they are n't! If THEY were getting free healthcare, they 'd be happy as clams, nary a word to say. They feel cheated, robbed and ripped off. They 're selfish, " But what about me " whinging is disgusting. <p> They also conviniently ignore that these people are POOR AS SHIT. And I bet they 'd rather not have to live at the same level as the people they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled, but I 'm no mooch. I worked my ass off while I was able, and I 'd give very much indeed to be working my tail off and paying more in taxes, because being poor suck, and I 'm NOT living high on the hog. <p> " Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split, as a general thing. " -- Robert E. Howard <p> Why is the minimum wage so low that people on it can not afford health care insurance. How many greedy conservatives claim to be working so hard, up until the moment you investigate and find they are not working at all, they a simply skimming the cream of minimum wage workers who are actually doing the work. <p> his family 's immigration to the US on a fairly regular basis. Cenk is a progressive. The real " Young Turks " were a progressive movement about 100 years that opposed the monarchy of the Ottoman Empire. Starting to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Cenk and Ana make a great team, but I can understand why some people in the Armenian community would be sensitive to the idea of a beautiful, intelligent Armenian-American reporter being on a show called the Young Turks... <p> " The greatest tyranny is censoring information in order to be better able to control people. " - Cristina Saralegui <p>... it 's simple economics. Seriously, even Randian fanboys should be able to do enough arithmetic to figure out that not spending money on food, shelter and healthcare for people who ca n't afford it IS CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN. People who are starving can not even get the chance to contribute to the economy, homeless people camped in front of your business drive away customers, unhealthy people spread disease and heck it costs money to get the stinking dead bodies off the street. <p> I really think that appeals to compassion are pointless in this debate. The cognitive dissonance just does n't register with these neanderthals because you ca n't convince them that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> But if you just point out that their math does n't work which proves that they 're meatheaded stupid even granting the their sinful religiously inconsistent moral positions, they 're stuck because they ca n't defend the math no matter what. <p> This argument is well known to folks battling the **27;1976;TOOLONG crowd who constantly harp about how you ca n't have morals without God : nope, it turns out that compassion is a strong evolutionary imperative that we see in most higher species. But to get the social policy issue points across it 's better to skip the Compassion step and go straight for the wallet : the only thing that these people *really* understand. <p> I 've spent years working in African nations with skewed income distribution. Lots of desperatly poor people, good amount of low level crime( a guy 's got to eat). Also spent time in developing countries with a more equitable income distribution and decent social safety net. Guess what, very little crime in those places. One can walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street crime. Compassion has nothing to do with it. I do n't want to be around a lot of people who do n't have enough to live on. Enough of them decide that it 's worth it to commit crimes to get what they need and want. <p>... Why should you get something for free when I have to work hard to pay for it? If your self-employed, why are you working for someone else 's health insurance? You 're not. If you employ people, you probably do n't pay enough for them to have health insurance and it 's usually less expensive when you have a group buy into a plan. If the President and the Democrats in the house and senate would have had more support from you and people like you, maybe we 'd have Single Payer or the Public Option and they would be less expensive for you. Finally, did n't the insurance companies capitalize on the ACA with a dramatic increase in premiums? So do n't blame the government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care not being available to anyone but those who could afford it. <p> Life, like Surfing is all about wave selection and balance. Never let the best waves in life go by. <p> The best argument you could make to an asshole like that caller is that his wife or his kids could become uninsured should he become ill or injured, and should that happen, should the rest of us just let his kids die if they need medical care? Well, should we? Or should we just keep an inescapable lifetime tally of healthcare debt, that can not be avoided by bankruptcy? Huh? What 's the answer you disgusting redneck repug? <p> I hate that no one ever points this out, but your private insurance works the same way - you pay premiums whether you need the service or not. You may pay premiums for years and never need to make a claim, yet the guy next to you may pay the same premium and make claims daily. So why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for his claims... or simply stop paying the premiums in protest? <p> You do n't... because you know that paying the premiums confirms that the service will be there when you need it. Hence, your tax dollars work the same way. <p> Let 's leave out for a moment that compassion for those less fortunate than yourself is a sign of an advanced society. Let 's assume this caller from Alabama was not even a religious fellow. One of the major reasons to pay to help others in society is because a catstrophic illness in a loved one or even the caller can lead to bancrupcy very, very fast annd loss of insurance. The very thing this man despises is what would save his or a loved one 's life in that circumstance. If this man has no compassion, at least he should recognize that a safety net placed for others to use, might very well be used by himself or those
