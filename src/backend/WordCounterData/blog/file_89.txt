5116941 <h> Is there a way to view a different plan period in your spending plan? <h> Admin Functions <p> I 'm moving some monthly charges out of one bucket and into a new one and want to set the start date for next month, but I 'm stuck in this month 's spending plan. Since all of my buckets are recurring monthly, I need those numbers to be factored into the " left to budget " for this month. I figure I could just view next month 's plan period to get around this, but I ca n't figure out how to do it. <p> Currently, you can see the current period. We are working on a way for you to better see and mange upcoming bills. But, until then, if you 're just moving an event from one bucket to another, then the " left to budget " amount will be the same. <p> Later, Mark <h> Admin Functions <p> That 's not the case actually because it was n't itemized in my budget and now it is. I may be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring. Even if I did n't though, I 'm budgeting for an item that I did n't specifically budget for in the past and it has a start date of next month. Because it starts next month, it 's not considered in my monthly budget. <p> There has to be a way to improve upon this. If I did n't know that was happening, I 'd probably go ahead and put it towards something else because I saw I had it. Then next month would roll around and all of a sudden I 'm over budget. <p> Maybe I 'm confused about some fundamentals of using MoneyWell to budget? I 've used it for a while now and some things about MoneyWell 2 now confuse the heck out of me. <p> Here 's another thing : if I do n't use all of one bucket one month and then decide the next month to give myself a little more to spend on dining out by doing a bucket transfer, why does it see that as income in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income buckets when I get my next pay check? Makes no sense to me. <p> Sorry to vent and thanks for your help! : -) <h> Admin Functions <p> You do n't see future money in buckets because envelope budgeting is about focusing on this period. You have income. You divide it up into buckets( envelopes). You spend only what 's in each bucket. It 's designed to give you a start and a finish to each period so you can see that you need to stop spending this month at some point. <p> MoneyWell 2.1 simply expands your ability to break out what is budgeted in each bucket. You are n't limited to one amount each now and can break out your Automobile spending into all the details that make up your car expenses. It 's all about giving you more information to make decisions and to streamline your spending plan. <h> Admin Functions <p> Gotcha. That makes sense. Maybe I should set the budget for that expenditure to last month, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait a day for it to show up in the whole plan so I 'm seeing next month 's period. Thanks for your help Kevin! <p> -- JB Bryant <h> Admin Functions <h> Admin Functions <p> JB, I wanted to point out that you described a scenario in your previous update where leftover money in one bucket was manually moved to another bucket, but then less income was added to that bucket. In 1.7, it was possible to have this happen as there was a setting on bucket transfer to specify whether it counted toward the budgeted amount or not. In 2.1, that setting is gone and manual transfers never count, so the situation you described should not exist. <h> Admin Functions <p> Interesting. I 'll have to look into that again. Is that the case from manual transfers from income buckets as well? I think that 's what happened. If I get extra money from somewhere unplanned, I just move that into a random bucket like debt. From what I recall, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of the plan that the bucket has been filled for the month so far. <h> Admin Functions <p> You 're both right, in a way. ;) Manual bucket transfers are n't counted when MoneyWell calculates the amounts on the Fill Buckets screen. That was always true, however in earlier 2.0 versions, the graph appeared to include those manual bucket transfers. It still did n't affect the fill amounts, but it looked like it did. That issue was fixed in 2.1, so the graph now agrees with the actual calculated fill
