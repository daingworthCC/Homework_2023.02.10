5197541 <h> Poll : People Hate Tolls, So Much They 'll Move to Avoid Them <p> According to a new SurveyUSA poll, a strong majority of King County residents say they will change their behavior to avoid tolls that would range between nothing( late at night) to $3.50( at rush hour) on the new SR-520 bridge---including 13 percent of residents who say they 'd actually be willing to move if it meant not paying to cross the bridge between Seattle and Bellevue. <p> Although the vast majority, 87 percent, said they use the 520 bridge once a week or less( and only 6 percent said they use the bridge more than three times a week), that did n't stop drivers from saying they 'd go out of their way to avoid the bridge once it 's tolled. Fully 54 percent said they 'd avoid the bridge altogether, while another 25 percent said they 'd reduce their use of the bridge.( Just 19 percent said tolls would have no effect on their driving behavior). Three-quarters said they 'd be no more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar percentage( 74 percent) said they 'd be no more likely to consider carpooling instead of driving alone. <p> Perhaps most surprisingly, 13 percent said they 'd consider moving away from their current homes to avoid paying tolls---pretty astonishing when you consider that that 's the same percentage of survey who reported driving across the bridge twice a week or more. Sixteen percent said they 'd consider changing jobs to avoid the tolls, and 75 percent said they 'd consider an alternate route to avoid 520, similar to the results of an earlier poll.( Of those, 71 percent picked I-90 as their preferred alternative). Most( 70 percent) said they opposed implementing a parallel toll on I-90. However, most people were n't willing to deal with the time impact choosing an alternative route would actually impose : The vast majority( 88 percent) said 15 minutes was too long to drive to avoid the tolls. <p> Of course, poll results are no indicator of actual future behavior : Studies, including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, non-tolled routes get clogged with traffic, people switch back to tolled routes because they 're faster and more convenient. <p> The headline makes no sense. 13% said the would CONSIDER moving. I do n't know why that 's sensational. The poll shows most people( 71%) plan on taking I-90 to get around the tolls. I do n't think this is a surprise to anybody. <p> Posted by jimu over 1 year Ago <p> Looking forward to that tunnel tolling! <p> Posted by gohuskies over 1 year Ago <p> Speaking of the tolled tunnel, I wonder if WSDOT 's delaying the 520 tolls has anything to do with the tunnel referendum. Pretty convenient that there wo n't be any headlines reading " Tolls on 520 cause massive delays on I-90 and 405 " until after the referendum. <p> Posted by mich over 1 year Ago <p> What people say and what they do can be entirely different. I cross the toll bridge on the Tacoma narrows/Highway 16 a couple times a month, with the Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the multiple toll bridges across the Columbia River where you have to stop and dish out cash, it 's still just no big deal. I remember them on 520 in the ' 70s as a kid and we would all want to be the one that got to hand the change to the toll booth attendant. Seattle folks always complain about change, but they also adapt to it pretty quickly. I 'm sure after the tolls have been in place for 6 months, it will be no big deal. <p> Posted by DH over 1 year Ago <p> Bring on the tolling of all limited access highways into the city. <p> Posted by Anc over 1 year Ago <p> Move, really? Cause another poll I read, taken on December 31st, said that most people in the coming year were going to lose weight, quit smoking cigarettes, exercise, and pursue their passions more. <p> Posted by scottmayhew2000 over 1 year Ago <p> DH, I get your point, and tend to agree so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't always come through in a poll like this where you are talking about something they have n't experienced yet. But the Narrows bridge really ca n't be compared to this. There is no alternate route there. Here there is an un-tolled bridge about 3 miles from 520. I think that 's the fatal flaw with this plan. Same with the tunnel. Plenty of alternate routes that do n't cost a thing. And the idea of a toll is conceptually difficult to deal with, versus say, gas and additional costs per mile of delay. I bet many people who divert to avoid a toll wo n't save that much money. But conceptually it seems cheaper to do than get hit for $4 or $5 each way. <p> Posted by mich over 1 year Ago <p> This poll was done in January. Eyman just picked it up. <p> Posted by Mikos over 1 year Ago <p> What surprises me is how unsurprised I am that people tend to predict they 'll definitely for sure take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey result that does shock me is that so many - 19 percent - have the gall to say they probably would n't change a thing. That 's a much higher " meh " factor than I 'd have expected. <p> Posted by gloomygs over 1 year Ago <p> Luckily people avoiding tolls and going over budget will not be issues on our magic, cure-all, downtown tunnel. <p> Posted by Rob over 1 year Ago <p> And can I just say how totally disappointed I am in my anti-tunnel friends who are out undermining years and years of work to get people to accept congestion pricing by exploiting anti tolling fears in their press conference today. Seeing Esther Handy, Alex-Jon Earl, Jeff Hammerquist and Colin Fournier Maloney out on their anti-tolling press conference today made me want to yak. Tolling is one of the progressive policies we must implement in the region and here 's these folks out there with an anti- tolling message. BOOOOOOOOO! I have been going back and forth on the tunnel but seeing these folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunt like the one today has made me question the credibility of the anti-tunnel camp. <p> Posted by UGH! over 1 year Ago <p> When you add up the costs of the tolls over the course of a year, I think people would be prudent to consider their options, including moving. Why is that so crazy? If the City of Redmond passed a fee that would charge residents $1750/yr for the privilege of living in Redmond, some people would move out of Redmond. <p> Posted by jimu over 1 year Ago <p> so much more goes into choosing where you live than paying a toll -- schools, community, house size, whats within walking distance, neighbors, friends, parks, work... etc... that to uproot because now you have to pay a toll seems a little far-fetched to me. but sure, if the only light you see through the end of your prism is filtered through dollar signs, then, yeah... move I guess. <p> Posted by scottmayhew2000 over 1 year Ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do n't mean jack... especially once they see how backed up 90 gets when everyone gives it a try. Same goes for the tunnel tolls.... once people realize how crappy surface streets are, they 'll pay the tolls. <p> Posted by Jakers over 1 year Ago <p> Interesting point... makes me wonder. <p> Posted by Jakers over 1 year Ago <p> It will all be moot after Eyman 's Initiative 1125 passes. Then there will be NO " congestion tolling, " and no tolling of any road to pay for any other road -- that is, until 1125 is ruled unconstitutional because it encompasses multiple subjects. Eyman wo n't give a shit -- he 'll just file1125 's components one at a time. Think you can stop him by advocating tolls when he 's advocating no tolls? Good luck. <p> Posted by ivan over 1 year Ago <p> You clearly do n't understand tolling policy. Tolling for congestion management and to raise money for transportation alternatives is progressive policy. Tolling to raise revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid by taking free surface streets is not, it 's just bad policy and a desperate attempt to fund a project that we ca n't afford, and do n't need. And if you are going to call people out in person, at least have the courage to use your own name. <p> Posted by Stacy over 1 year Ago <p> Tolls are not progressive, period. Congestion pricing = rich people get to avoid traffic = bad for poor and working class people = regressive tax. Classic example of New Urbanist elitists posing as progressives( and writing off the 1/3 of the city that lives west of SR 99 and relies on that corridor by saying we " do n't need " it is another). <p> Posted by Mr. X over 1 year Ago <p> i hate that guy. <p> Posted by scottmayhew2000 over 1 year Ago <p> So a bunch of people who rarely take 520 might still barely take 520? A poll of that 6% who use the bridge regularly would be interesting, this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 year Ago <p> It 's much easier to tell a pollster you 'll move or add time to your commute than to actually do it. <p> Posted by sgiffy over 1 year Ago <p> If someone uses 520 five times a week at high-tolling times, that 's $70 a month, or $840 a year. And yet some people( County Councilmembers, for instance) are saying that no one can afford to pay another $20 a year to keep bus service at the current level. <p> Posted by sarah over 1 year Ago <p> We heard the same thing in Gig Harbor before the new Narrow 's Bridge was completed. An amazing thing happened when it opened and the tolls started. Traffic volume held steady. <p> Posted by Derek Young over 1 year Ago <p> 01/18/2011 <p> Posted by Mikos over 1 year Ago <p> It has nothing to do with that and everything to do with the contractor 's ability to accurately collect tolls on the Tacoma and 520 bridges. Delaying the collection of a fee or tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed the news reports from an actual news organization. <p> Posted by Mr Baker over 1 year Ago <p> You are a freeking libertarian! Welcome to the club! <p> Posted by repete over 1 year Ago <p> so you hate him. does that mean if he was dying on the side of the road or his family was being attacked you would do nothing? <p> Posted by Monster over 1 year Ago <p> interesting question... definitely save his family... probably call 911 for Eyman himself... i wouldnt know how to save him even if i was enamored with him. <p> Posted by scottmayhew2000 over 1 year Ago <p> Tolling is not progressives policy. If you are imposing fee each car that uses the street, then What about those who do n't have the money? We need to get better ways to raise revenue for our transportation mess. Accesive tolling will create unequal society interms of street usage, and this may result many uninteded consequences. <p> Posted by yusuf over 1 year Ago <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave overcrowded Seattle for better space in Black Diamond and Kent( Howard Hansen is patched up and better than ever, and there 's plenty of great waterfront space along the Green River bike trail that would be perfect for software and other high tech companies that want to offer their employees sane living.) <p> Posted by John Bailo over 1 year Ago <p> I am not libertarian. I am progressives with big heart for the Poor and most vonurable among us. That is Who i am. I am not libertarian. <p> Posted by yusuf over 1 year Ago <p> Congestion pricing that ca n't fund transit alternatives is what will hurt the poor( i.e. Eyman 's tolling initiative). Congestion pricing is recognized as the only proven method to reduce congestion. More lanes and/or better flowing roads just fill up with cars putting us back to square one. Even providing transit does n't reduce congestion( people will still consume whatever road space is available), but sufficient transit can be the socially just alternative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archie over 1 year Ago <p> I am for mass transit and reducing polution by crafting better social policy that can solve the problems in the long run. Allmost all the transportation policies are complex. One must examine the social and financial cost of these projects in orden to arrive reasonable conclusin. And What i am noticing is that some of the transportation advocates are losing sight of the bigger picture--meaning the impact of these transportation issues( eg tolling) to the larger Community. <p> It 's more than that. I think you figured one-way commuting prices. The article reads to me that it 's $3.50/each transit of the bridge, not per round trip. <p> Posted by FireDude over 1 year Ago <p> Do people consider moving because the cost of gas has increased their commute costs more than the cost of tolls may? People are irrational. They 'll complain about most proposed changes. Make the changes and see what people actually do. <p> Posted by William C Bonner over 1 year Ago <p> what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Seems to apply here. I do n't commute across 520, but I see those who do queued up every day on I-5 and it looks miserable..... as a hypothetical, if my commute across 520 were to be 30-45 mins less per day via congestion reduction from tolling, I 'd gladly pay the $7 bucks. In addition, if tolling allows us to build a 6 lane bridge instead of an 8 lane untolled bridge, that has value in cost savings as well. <p> Posted by Chris over 1 year Ago <p> There is an alternative to the narrows bridge, you can drive down to Olympia and take 101 for free, it just takes longer. I-90 will be similar, when traffic flow their doubles by toll avoiders, the benefit to cost ratio will send drivers back to 520. An extra hour of commuting time stuck in traffic costs most people more than $3. You seem to forget that 520 had a toll for decades and people still used it and paid for it. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that live in Seattle and drive to Redmond, most will pay the cash for the fastest route. I know, since this includes a bunch of my friends. <p> Posted by DH over 1 year Ago <p> Not only did it hold steady, the double of road capacity crossing the narrows completely eliminated the massive backups on highway 16. I remember it taking an hour at times to go from I-5 to the bridge along 16, it was always backed up from 3-6pm. Now that drive takes 10 minutes, it 's such a huge improvement. <p> Posted by DH over 1 year Ago <p> Some people will just not take jobs that require them to pay a toll, too... but then again, some people prefer to live closer to where they work so would n't commute across 520 anyway. Personally, I 'll avoid driving toll roads or take public transportation across them -- provided the roads/bridges are built with
