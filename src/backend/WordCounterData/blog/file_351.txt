5143341 <h> Challenging Realism in the Early 1960s Films <h> by HAMISH FORD <p> Cinema today should be tied to the truth rather than to logic. And the truth of our daily lives is neither mechanical, conventional nor artificial, as stories generally are, and if films are made that way, they will show it. <p> his article explores the ways in which Antonioni 's work, homing in on the first four 1960s films, presents a historically embedded yet today still radical cinema in which the filmmaker 's famous modernism and a highly developed form of realism coexist in provocative and generative ways. Describing what he sees as the central contradiction and exponentially enabling antinomy of modernist works, P. Adams Sitney writes that they ' stress vision as a privileged mode of perception, even of revelation, while at the same time cultivating opacity and questioning the primacy of the visible world. '( 1992, p. 2) He later provides a quote from Maurice Blanchot that beautifully illustrates the resulting material, aesthetic, and conceptual reality : ' Present in its absence, graspable because ungraspable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102). Such is the properly paradoxical, inherently dialectical enunciation of modernist realism exemplified by Antonioni 's mature work. <p> Elsewhere I address the conceptual implications of Antonioni 's special aesthetic innovations, arguing in particular for L'eclisse ' s( 1962) substantive philosophical impact( Ford, 2012). But this is only possible thanks to a very immanent, far from rarefied reality presented by the films incorporating a very real Italy of the post-war period and the filmic image itself. More than debates concerning much-discussed metaphysical schemas of religious or secular values, it is ultimately through at once larger yet also inherently more quotidian forces that Antonioni 's cinema mounts its repeated blows. In his book The Inhuman, Jean-Franois Lyotard suggests : <p> What is hit first of all, and complains, in our modernity, or our postmodernity, is perhaps space and time.... The real ' crisis of foundations ' was doubtless not that of the foundations of reason but of any scientific enterprise bearing on so-called real objects, in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 112). <p> In Antonioni 's cinema, space and time are the primary sites within, upon and from which an immeasurable violence is played out. This constitutes the historically specific world presented by the films -- the only reality on offer. <p> Describing the director 's remarkable first colour feature, Il deserto rosso( 1964), Peter Brunette writes : ' There is no sense of spirituality here, no redeeming transcendence '( 1999, p. 105). The film neither proselytises present-day technologised reality and its economic-industrial dictates or ethically decries it in favour of a different vision( the reason Antonioni 's cinema is ultimately so difficult for those seeking to forge clear-cut political analyses). The filmmaker 's distinct modernism not only casts doubt upon the building blocks of classical and ' traditional ' modes of both life and cinema alike, but equally contemporary, allegedly ' modern ' ones( the question of what constitutes the modern very much in play). L'avventura( 1960), La notte( 1961), L'eclisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fundamental remaking of the cinematic image in my view, despite the considerable and diverse claims of his other work -- demonstrate their immediate modernity 's inherent oppositions and unreconciled problems at the same time as rendering that reality in increasingly ' stylised ' ways. The last film of this cycle famously illustrates the ' pro-filmic ' world it portrays as rather uninhabitable, environmentally but also conceptually, for the kind of humans who build and administer it. But neither Il deserto rosso nor its director in contemporaneous interviews( perhaps counter-intuitively in this case) suggest denunciation, and the remarkable aesthetic incarnation of reality on screen is clearly the source of real fascination and creativity for filmmaker and viewer alike -- no matter how we feel about the worldly ' facts '. <p> 18HF001 - Deserto rosso( M. Antonioni -- 1964) <p> Increasingly, the critical tenor in Antonioni scholarship is to try and avoid or heavily bracket talk of ' alienation ', which is now often understandably seen as a dangerous simplifying clich by recent commentators such as Rascaroli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who instead favour( as is the trend in recent academic film studies) detailed historical contextualisation. Brunette argues that the familiar descriptions of Antonioni 's famous 1960s films in particular as offering vaguely existentialist and ahistorical fables about ' alienation ' and loss of identity tends to downplay socio-political details and interest, thereby underselling their substantive radicalism. Stressing unknowability and incommensurability, he writes that ' nothing ever seems to add up in these films... beyond a vague sense of uneasiness and alienation, and thus most critics have this to be what they are about. '( ibid, p. 3) Yet while treatment of this often misused concept and long-familiar trope as the key to understanding Antonioni 's most influential work can easily have the effect of disavowing the films ' enormous diversity of thematic suggestion, aesthetic form, and affective power, there are also more precise, historical reasons for its application. <p> In his long 1958 forward to the second edition of Critique of Everyday Life, Volume 1 -- as it happens, composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration with L'avventura and select initial works of la Nouvelle Vague -- Henri Lefebvre argues( using the gendered language) that the products of ' modern man ' and ' his works function like beings of nature. He must objectify himself... If man has humanized himself, he has done so only by tearing himself apart, dividing himself, fragmenting himself( 1991, p. 71). In the main text that follows, written in 1947, Lefebvre reads as if directly addressing the disconnect but also the ambiguous possibility charted in Antonioni 's films from the period no matter our critical position or thematic conclusions : ' Man attains his own reality, creates himself through, within and by means of his opposite, his alienation : the inhuman. '( 1991, p. 170). Carefully considered in light of Antonioni 's idiosyncratic realism, alienation can be one legitimate means to a historically grounded understanding of the films. The problem, I think, occurs if we then jump to a critical conclusion as to what alienation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular the presumption that it inherently leads to despair and cessation of assumed ' human ' progress. Just as alienation is often an effect or weapon of capital and political power, the complex aesthetic and spectatorial effects of Antonioni 's realism demonstrates it can also be harnessed to pursue very different, radical re-forgings of reality and the human. This ambiguity is a key to the films ' ever-expanding life, concurrently critiquing and exhibiting confronting openness with the same gesture. <p> Providing a rigorously secular vision of the world, the four early ' 60s films( sometimes bundled together as ' the Tetralogy ') present pressing challenges at the heart of an everyday reality, no matter how unique and ' advanced ' its sound-image rendering. While often appearing via quite ' abstract ' aesthetic patterns -- the framing of Marcello Mastroianni and especially Jeanne Moreau against the diverse architectural bodies and surfaces of Milano in La notte ; Vittoria 's intimate exchanges with the natural and human-made textures and spaces of palimpsestic Roma, both its fabled centro storico and recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over the whole film in its famous final minutes ; or the highly manipulated, sometimes literally painted colour palette and depth-flattening camerawork of Il deserto rosso rendering Ravenna 's industrial region, quay, and town centre -- the films ' characters respond in often quite precise ways to their distinct phenomenal realities. Meanwhile, as is so often discussed, the camera itself frequently offers a slightly ' removed ' perspective on the human events, regardless of spatial proximity. So important to Italy 's post-war ' economic miracle ', L'eclisse portrays the Borsa( then Roma 's stock exchange) as an architecturally commanding space housing an intriguing but impossible-to-comprehend reality. With the film 's famous stock market crash scene, this locale -- once devoted to religious worship, at the time of the film the centre for secular, modern prayer -- is treated by the camera with fascinated detachment for a full fifteen minutes as if watching an ancient ritual or futuristic practice about which it offers no inside knowledge. The architecture and the abstract human activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scene, which is so incremental and stretched out that some time elapses before the viewer realises ' something is happening '. As the seemingly chaotic human movement on screen develops into an ' event ' its reality is delivered by increasingly ' documentary ' -like yet immaculately composed images that seem to take over the film, such that when our presumed protagonist finally emerges very late in the scene her appearance is quite a surprise. <p> 18HF002 - L'eclisse( M. Antonioni -- 1962) <p> Antonioni 's project as laid out in the epigraph quote necessitates a remaking of realism, which in its classical Hollywood narrative, Italian neorealist, documentary or politically revolutionary forms is no longer realistic both in terms of what it shows and how. To confront this challenge the director explores everyday reality 's uncanny and even sometimes bizarre appearance as powered by rapid economic, technological and environmental change, including that of the heavily virtual reality of the moving image, in sustained and often surprisingly diverse portrayals of this modern world 's physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via a medium reflexively acknowledging its own crucial role in the re-conceiving of reality is inextricably affected by arguably the central characteristic of this cinema : a radically enhanced ambiguity. Far from a rarefied philosophical issue, the films demonstrate this confronting concept and experience as at the heart of the modern everyday in all its confusion and provocation. Lefebvre sees ambiguity as ' a category of everyday life, and perhaps an essential category ' of contemporary modernity, continuing with an enormously resonant passage : <p> It never exhausts its reality ; from the ambiguity of consciousness and situations spring forth actions, events, results, without warning. These, at least, have clear-cut outlines. They maintain a hard, incisive objectivity which constantly disperses the luminous vapours of ambiguity -- only to let them rise once again( 1991, p. 18). <p> This evokes uncannily well both the post-war reality charted in Antonioni 's peak modernist cinema addressed here and the fundamentally paradoxical lens through which we see it on screen. <p> The most historically important discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Italian neorealism, famously arguing that the late 1940s films of Robert Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica, and Luchino Visconti ' transfer to the screen the continuum of reality '( 1967, p. 37). This cinema brought about innovations later expanded by Antonioni in liberating both space and time from the hegemony of narrative movement so as to forge a much more ambiguous image, the deep focus textures of which, Bazin argued, allowed the viewer an enhanced perceptual realism and therefore a more ambiguous image to aesthetically explore and thematically interpret( ibid, p. 39). Neorealism 's lingering ethico-political certainties and aura of commitment, however, seem long past by the time of Antonioni 's early ' 60s films.( His one rather abstract contribution to the ' neorealist ' tradition in terms of aesthetics and featured socio-economic class, 1957 's Il Grido, is arguably outdone by the later Zabriskie Point in 1970 when it comes to a heavily qualified appearance of political engagement.) Yet startlingly passive in their wandering and gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which to initiate and virtually centre the search, the films ' female protagonists are effectively gentrified, updated and gender-appropriated versions of neorealism 's wandering male seers : middle-class figures indicative of Italy 's socioeconomic transformation( infamously concentrated in the north). No longer part of an agrarian, proletariat, or impoverished family fighting for external survival, a seemingly well-educated and notionally single female protagonist like Vittoria in L'eclisse is both a direct result of the country 's post-war resurgence, much freer and more modern than her neorealist forebears, yet appears both interested in and vaguely dissatisfied with such a reality. The individuated, newly ' liberated ' subject passively moves through and observes the exponentially modern world with no essential purpose, unable to conceive definitive action within it. <p> This more ' modern ' protagonist is at once more intimately felt than the often heavily archetypal, non-individuated characters of neorealism, yet the re-figured realism of Antonioni 's early ' 60s films at the same time fails to support the ontological inscribing of subjectivity and its gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real charted by the films. Just as Antonioni 's cinema constitutes a notably more ' detached ', elliptical yet also modulating examination of these questions than we see in neorealism, so is subjectivity both more strongly sensed and essayed yet also portrayed as operating from a position of increased uncertainty -- a crisis fuelled by lack of surety as to what constitutes the objective world. When it comes to both subjectivity and mastery of the objective environment -- as opposed to the latter 's apparently material facticity in the films -- Antonioni 's cinema presents reality as made up of conditions as described by Lyotard when he writes : ' Modernity, in whatever age it appears, can not exist without a shattering of belief and without discovery of the " lack of reality " of reality... '( 1978, p. 77) The director 's radical ' updating ' of realism has the inevitable effect that physical and human reality looks increasingly strange and ' stylised ', hence his cinema 's historical portrayal by some critics as primarily interested in pictorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Antonioni 's defenders, like the matter of alienation, this response can also be too quickly dismissed. <p> There is certainly a lot to be gained from reading the films in the form of precise historical portraits, as much recent Antonioni scholarship seeks to do. Yet in the process we can easily overlook that through peak enunciation of the director 's highly idiosyncratic modernist aesthetics, the early ' 60s films in particular also transcend this ' reality ' on and beyond the screen. In this sense they become heavily virtual and singular texts that for many viewers -- both familiar and otherwise with the director 's style -- evoke what Martin Heidegger called in 1935 the ' solitary ' work of art( 1993, p. 191) seeming to stand apart from the rest of the film-world, having ' cut all ties to human beings '( ibid.). The films are certainly interested in the great human drama, but their way of formally presenting the human subject, its immediate spatial reality and inextricably bound relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of and ' feel '. Such an engagement can bring about the sense that, in Heidegger 's words, something very new, different, perhaps even ' extraordinary ' is ' thrust to the surface ' while here the conventions of cinema, ' the long-familiar ', is ' thrust down '( ibid.). However, this equally important ' truth ' or reality of Antonioni 's peak modernist work as it appears to the viewer is not ultimately in contradiction with the fact that the films also both emerge from precise historical conditions and chart a very human reality. It is arguably their uncommonly developed and rigorous means of presenting such a reality that can make them look so strange and ' cold '. <p> In 1957, long-time Antonioni scholar Renzo Renzi argued of the gaze through which we view the world as causing a perceived ' coldness ', that it ' is in fact a sign of self-conscious responsibility, aware of the shortfalls of moral judgment and clear annunciations about the reality from which the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 92-3) This lack of judgment is both moral and epistemological : not only a refusal to proclaim how things should be but also how they are. Both are cut down through an always shifting emphasis on the vagaries of audio-visual perception faced by the viewer. Maurice Merleau-Ponty writes that perception responds ' to a situation and to an environment which are not the workings of a pure, knowing subject. '( 1964, p. 4) Floundering in the ambiguities( moral, political, perceptual) of their respective corners of post-war Italian reality, Lidia, Vittoria, Claudia( L'avventura), and especially Giuliana( Il deserto rosso) are not ' knowing subjects ' in this sense. Neither, quite differently, is the viewer. We do not confront perceptual problems ' with ' the characters of these films, even if we sometimes feel ' closer ' to them than with most of Antonioni 's later features( as Rohdie argues of the films following Blow-Up). The camera is on the one hand unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to or even outside the domain of human drama, most radically in L'eclisse with its famous final seven minutes, but really from the very first frame. <p> Like many subsequent writers, Pier Paolo Pasolini draws attention to a development in Il deserto rosso whereby the camera loses interest in Corrado 's attempts to entice potential employees sitting in a Ravenna warehouse with his slated Patagonia business venture. The viewer is then presented with a <p> stupendous close-up of a distressingly " real " Emilian worker followed by an insane pan from the bottom up along an electric blue stripe on the whitewashed wall of the warehouse. All this testifies to a deep, mysterious, and -- at times -- great intensity in the formal idea that excites the fantasy of Antonioni.( 2005, pp. 178-9) <p> Pasolini is precise in highlighting the shift from the ' distressingly real ' worker 's face to the sheer abstraction of the coloured line, however the cut between the two is less a shift of perspective and focus than a mark of continuity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' egalitarian gaze treats a decontextualised painted line on a wall and the weather-beaten visage of an ' authentic ' human being as of equal graphic and ' objective ' interest. With the cut between the ' human ' and the ' inhuman ', realism and modernism dissolve into one image. The wonderfully evoked ' insane pan ', meanwhile, is n't the end of the jolting ' distraction ' away from any narrative shards and human vestiges, when the film cuts to a shot outside the warehouse dominated with futuristic-looking bright blue bottles stacked neatly on straw bedding. <p> 18HF003 - Deserto rosso( M. Antonioni -- 1964) <p> The scene, only ever very tangentially and hesitantly connected to the film 's already loose story of Giuliana, thereby concludes with narrative interest and information about the scenario entirely overcome by aesthetic detailing of material space -- including that of the worker 's face, then moving beyond the human. With such diversions into physical, spatial and graphic reality, no matter how ' artificial ' its appearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of then-'hi tech ' modernity suggesting such a distinction as no longer viable -- and away from a purported diegesis, important narrative information ' goes missing '. In compensation, the viewer is invited to imbibe and process veritable explosions of aesthetic and conceptual material gleaned from this very precise reality, just as we do in other scenes where the film lingers on enormous eruptions of steam and coloured gas emanating from the abstract industrial landscape as if from a primordial fissure in the earth 's crust. <p> John David Rhodes writes of the Chinese Government 's outraged response to Antonioni 's remarkable 1972 documentary Cina Chung Kuo : ' In a sense, the Chinese officials -- whether they knew it or not -- were saying something true about Antonioni 's cinema : it was often looking at what seemed to be the wrong things. But such looking constitutes his style. '( 2011, p. 297) Through ' looking at the wrong things ', narrative( or indeed ideological) attenuation generates room for so much else. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt cost of its habitual epistemological privilege. Not ' knowing ', never getting a sense of control over what we see, in fact paradoxically enables a much clearer vision of modern reality itself as characterised by opacity and fragmentation. The net benefit of this process is an enormous outpouring of textural and spatial detailing. Let us consider a relatively unostentatious example in the form of a sequence from La notte, itself today the least discussed of Antonioni 's ' 60s films( despite arguably being more closely tied to historical context, the social and cultural climate of il boom essayed at its powerful centre). <p> 18HF004 - La notte( M. Antonioni -- 1961) <p> In a brief sequence away from the mansion party that comprises the second half of the film, rather than giving us access to the car in which Lidia and a young man seem to talk and flirt, we can hear nothing beyond the sound of rain as the camera leaves us mutely outside for over a minute during which we glimpse snatches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as distorted by water pouring down the window. <p> While the viewer can interpret Lidia 's apparent pleasure at her hermetic, private encounter away from both the high-decadence gathering and the viewer 's own sound-image, this notional protagonist and her problems have been so little fleshed out in the preceding film( now nearing its end) that our narrative attention risks badly drifting when denied dialog in this highlighted, very beautiful scene. Instead, the experience offered is to enjoy and explore the densely textured monochrome gradations and modulating patterns made by the streaks of flowing water on the dark vehicle 's glass and chassis. Taking a more ' auteurist ' line, we may of course seek to interpret Antonioni 's refusal to take us inside this protean couple 's temporary adulterous bubble for what it might suggest of Lidia 's individual frustrations or the repressive, privileged class she represents. But such immediate tweaking of the sound-image into a ' text ' to be read not only involves consciously felt hermeneutic work ; the will-to-interpretation also seems to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusiveness, its properly ambiguous reality. While different readings of the shot in the context of this narratively ' slack ' film can provide genuine pleasure -- and likewise fruitful accounts of the reality offered by La notte in terms of its portrayal of modern Italy 's business ' winners ' alongside our more anguished protagonists from the intellectual sphere -- such interpretive and analytical frames, while perhaps revealing and informative, are also themselves overwhelmed by the undeniable cinematic facts : constantly shifting patterns and transforming shapes brought about by a slowly moving car in the rain, undulating chiaroscuro effects of a flashing traffic light, and the background architecture of a quiet street. <p> The image 's material-aesthetic ' autonomy ' is a crucial part of this cinema 's distinct realism. Each shot in L'eclisse has an undeniable solidity in rendering a particular material reality within Roma 's various inner and outer regions( plus the small Verona airport where Vittoria enjoys a lyrical interlude), all the while intimating an unstable flux between the clarity and vaporous ambiguity Lefebvre describes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final minutes, in which the viewer is denied the film 's protagonists, we are confronted with the most famous( although cited much more than actually analysed) loss of fullness, character and drama or ' fiction ' in Antonioni 's cinema. The viewer is challenged, or offered, to pursue other interests that while seeming ' new ' are in fact comprised of the same environment that dominated much of the film but now taking on an explicitly ' starring ' foreground role. <p> Highlighting just one brief moment from L'eclisse ' s aesthetically and conceptually rich final minutes, the camera observes floating debris in the water of a barrel into which Vittoria had earlier placed a piece of wood at an awkward moment of indecision and stasis with her potential love interest, the vain young stockbroker Piero. Following a cut, an extravagant tracking shot shows water leaking out from the barrel along the ground. Other shots of the EUR intersection follow, including some that feature human figures that from the back could be our protagonists but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then another interior shot of the barrel is followed by two decontextualised close shots, presumably showing the leakage on the ground as it forms a slick, made up of entirely abstract shapes. Following the earlier barrel and water tracking shots, this miniature-sublime double-image in many ways crystallises the way the whole sequence replaces narrative and thematic development( shaky from the very start) with a descriptive and inherently ambiguous detailing of the world. The familiar street corner and surrounds now emerge as an ever-modulating material set of facts, the contours of which are changing beyond recognition before our eyes. The images of this seven-minute ' coda ' together comprise a freshly dripping canvas by which to wash away our memories of the recognisably human through looking directly upon the phenomenal world in a ' documentary ' or ' experimental ' rendering of material space as transforming through time. <p> 18HF005 - L'eclisse( M. Antonioni -- 1962) <p> Like an enormously elongated incarnation of Pasolini 's ' insane pan ', L'eclisse ' s ending may well be Antonioni 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case, it ultimately makes explicit what is present throughout : the reality of the filmed world as very consistent yet epistemologically destabilising ground upon which a genuinely modern realism is forged. Rohdie argues that these films ' true productivity lies in ' the new shapes, the new stories, the new, the temporary, subjects which they permit. To lose perspective, to lose identity, which are often open " tragedies " for Antonioni 's characters, are opportunities for the films. '( 1990, p. 2) In the case of L'eclisse it is the viewer who is challenged to overcome the ' tragedy ' of the protagonists being evicted from the film, to see if another ' opportunity ' can be grasped through such loss. But this risky relationship between film and viewer is in operation throughout Antonioni early ' 60s cinema no matter whether the characters remain in the frame. For the now infamous May 1960 Cannes audience first confronted with L'avventura, largely unused to such treatment of spatial and temporal reality, the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for Anna, who has already disappeared from the film, by the remaining people -- and enters into a realm of increasingly abstracted documentary essaying. The framing and choreography of bodies moving in space generate enormous thematic inference for the viewer watching these very privileged figures of post-war Italian modernity( yet clearly also suggestive of historically inherited wealth and power) dragging their jaded and dysfunctional human investments across this primordial ground, dwarfed by the overwhelming environment and unforgiving power of the Aeolian sea, the violence of which may have taken one of their number( whereas in fact, like Vittoria and Piero at the end of L'eclisse, she has simply left the film). <p> 18HF006 - L'avventura( M. Antonioni -- 1960) <p> Despite far less obviously ' sublime ' mise en scne, La notte is even more immediately dominated by pictorial abstraction with Milano 's architecture and concrete taking the place of L'avventura ' s volcanic rock, the urban environment no more comprehensible or reassuring than what William Arrowsmith calls nature 's ' deep primordial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work( 1995, p. 55). In a more overtly reflexive fashion, it is formal experiment and aesthetic play with colour, line, texture and bodies -- human and otherwise -- that dominates Il deserto rosso. Yet the director 's modernist appropriation of realism, or vice versa, and here the absolute flattening of distinctions between historical and filmic ' realities ', means that none of these highly tactile, at times seemingly ' 3D ' and increasingly virtual images culminating with Antonioni 's first colour film are ' beyond ' reality. Rather, they strikingly yet most fittingly present the various ' shocks ' and radical modifications of familiar experience within this technologised, hyper-industrialised world, even as the viewer 's gaze upon it is clearly very different to that of our troubled, closely felt yet never truly accessible protagonist. <p> Brought to life by viewer engagement, each of Antonioni 's early ' 60s films offer a distinct ' reality ' comprised of a doubled vision that becomes flattened into one ambiguous modernist-realist image comprised of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its distinct regions and cities in context of which the notional characters life and move, and the often ' abstract ' framing of all this before the viewer. This means that while the films offer loosely character-based narratives, the tentative offering of ' feeling ' and meaning is ultimately untethered to the characters and their drama and rather more to the less usually highlighted nexus famously stressed by Walter Benjamin : the camera( 1992, p. 672). We sense this more strongly than usual with Antonioni 's most famous films perhaps because the images seem to have at least a partial stake in the human drama but as a frequently detached onlooker also equally, or sometimes much more so, drawn to other potential interests. There are moments where the viewer can feel Claudia, Lidia, Vittoria or Giuliana ' within reach '( or at least the performative embodiment of Vitti or Moreau). In terms of proximity this is often the case thanks to the camera skirting the personal space of these favoured subjects, only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite being privileged over all other potential subjects. In L'avventura we are able to perceive Claudia 's anguish, sometimes sensing it up close on the island and later on the Sicilian mainland, but we never really get to know her or understand her actions despite being more invested in this character 's fate than that of any other( disturbingly including Anna, whose potential return we may also come to ' fear ' along with Claudia late in the film at the Taormina hotel). In La notte the frustrations and jaded ' ennui ' of Giovanni and Lidia are palpable from the start, but only through a very broad sketching of the couple as representing a formerly idealistic northern intelligentsia. No matter how much time we spend with these bodies, they remain out of reach as subjects. In L'eclisse, the dialectical **33;351;TOOLONG exhibited by Vittoria when confronted with Roma at its fabled core and modern, half-built but recently rejuvenated periphery is strongly felt, and we feel more for her than anyone else in the film( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand hardly anything of her desires, ideals or intentions throughout. <p> Rather than sharing the protagonist 's perspective, we observe her predicaments from a not disinterested but also not entirely committed distance as played out within evocative yet always recognisable and ' real ' post-war space. The camera travels along nearby the favoured human figures observing them, Ian Cameron suggests, not from a clearly ' subjective ' perspective, but rather from ' **31;386;TOOLONG '( 1968, p. 10) that can appear to offer, but never totally allow, ' identification ' in part because there is no entirely convincing subject on screen with whom we can relate. If up until L'eclisse a kind of mid-way camera position forces the viewer to work at achieving any kind of subjective view of character, with Il deserto rosso a heightened sense of the ' subjective ' seems more palpable to the point of what can appear a kind of neo-expressionism, while at the same time protagonistic subjectivity is at a dual apogee and crisis point from which it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denuded colour, out-of-focus shots, flattened depth-of-field, and compositions mixing industry and the ' artificial ', polluted nature, and human components. Such perceptually confusing formalism can be seen -- or ' justified ' -- as acting ' empathetically ' with Giuliana, the most apparently ' neurotic ' of Antonioni 's protagonists. However, Seymour Chatman writes of the film : ' But who is the subject? Subjective can refer to the psyche of the character, or to that of the camera, the film 's mute narrator, or to both concurrently. '( 1985, p. 131) Even where we might seek to order and explain the filmic reality in front of us as ' accessing ' Giuliana 's psyche, the subject is concurrently never more in doubt or felt as directly borne of the film 's formal construction and heightened reflexivity. <p> 18HF007 - Deserto rosso( M. Antonioni -- 1964) <p> Rohdie argues that ' though the camera is often subjective ' -- even as what this means is not clear -- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " regarded ; Giuliana 's subjectivity is more an ' object ' observed than a subjectivity to identify with. '( 1990, p. 185) Regardless of how ' objective ' or ' subjective ' their gaze or doubling thereof can appear in a given instant, the films make perceivable the actuality of such a moment as generated for the viewer through distinct cinematic procedures. Like the heavily qualified enactment and skirting of subjectivity, objectivity for these films is itself an always ambiguous domain of lived experience. Merleau-Ponty describes the capacity for ' objectively observable behaviour ' as a site for meaning to an extent no less than within the realm of subjective experience, provided that ' objectivity is not confused with what is measurable. '( 1964, p. 24) No matter how seemingly ' objective ' they become, Antonioni 's films never equate the gaze with measurability. Their dissolution of distinctions between objective and subjective gazes, realism and modernism, drama and abstract ' documentary ' interests, space and intentional graphic detailing, both enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance in what seems like a non-human perspective shared between L'avventura ' s camera and viewer : <p> Beyond the basically human point of view incarnated in the protagonists, there is another point of view. That abstract point of view is picked up in a nonhuman way by the camera in random movements -- explosions, clouds, Brownian motions, spots, indeed, a neutral space filled with any movement whatsoever within which the flow of Antonioni 's film comes to rest.( 1989, p. 217) <p> While strongly marked by a sense of autonomy and non-anthropocentric concerns, this ' other point of view ' in which the films ' come to rest ' is still ultimately ' human ' but in an often very unfamiliar sense. For Gilles Deleuze, all Antonioni 's shots, including the most seemingly ' inhuman ' or ' objective ' images, offer what he calls an ' invisible subjectivity '. Here objectivity becomes internalised, Deleuze writes, so that it is ' formed through becoming mental, and going into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective to the subjective, and are internalised in everyone. '( 1989, p. 8) These films allow us to gaze upon bodies in and of the world, human and otherwise, so as to ' see ' this reality for all its oscillation of clarity and ambiguity, in the process internalising objectivity -- including its most ' alien ', subject-challenging elements -- just as subjective energy and desire transforms our understanding of the material world. <p> ' I feel the need to express reality in terms that are not completely realistic ', explains the director in relation to Il deserto rosso( 1996, p. 28). The world is rendered in Antonioni 's films through a focus on the objects, places, spaces and forms of the physical reality in front of the camera as transformed by its inherently artificial gaze -- a ' new ' but now essential component of modern reality and how we see it. ' In Antonioni 's work the world is never merely a setting or a symbol, ' writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 194). Instead, the ineffable presence and confronting ambiguity of space and time takes over. Examples abound throughout the films where specific environments in all their objective power and genuinely mysterious resonance seem to overwhelm the characters, dwarfing the human drama and subjective frame. Ground zero in terms of nature is L'avventura ' s island search. But the film enacts reality 's more radical and human-made power as the architectural and topographical spaces of Sicilia somehow work to overwhelm the original purpose of Claudio and Sandro 's road trip with creeping nihilistic effect. The central moment of this remarkable development seems to be when they visit the modern Fascist-built but never occupied workers ' village when looking for Noto, the scene concluding with a remarkable sense of presence evoked by a slow eerie tracking shot down an exterior corridor towards the couple as they get in the car and drive away. A very surprising edit then ushers in their first kiss and embrace, framed from below against blank sky. Here perhaps is the moment that best explains Deleuze 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nietzschean project of a real critique of morality '.( 1989, p. 8) Any such philosophical reading can only come about, however, because the filmed reality of Sicilia, the deserted village, and the stretched tracking shot followed by a spatially and temporally indeterminate ellipsis can be read as ' forging ' this morally confronting event. <p> 18HF008 - L'avventura( M. Antonioni -- 1960) <p> A more consistently modern source of filmed reality 's uncanny power can be strongly sensed in L'eclisse, not only in its famous conclusion but also in a small moment such as when Vittoria seeks out the source of eerie sounds made by flagpoles in the nocturnal breeze of a deserted EUR boulevard, and slinks within the shadows of an absurd oversized statue. For the protagonists, but even for the viewer watching these images giving an unprecedented role to the power of both primordial and modern time, and natural and human-made space, the world seems ' " already there " before reflection begins -- as an inalienable presence ', @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. vii). Antonioni 's films suggest this in the prominence given to the world in all its quotidian imminence and ubiquitous sublimity, its historically located modernity and primordial intimation, prior to, during, and particularly after the humans have played out their drama. ' By tying perception to the actual shape and status of the external world, ' Rohdie writes, Antonioni ' made them both equally subject of his films, and equally ambiguous and tenuous. '( 1990, p. 72) This joining makes neither any less impactful ; on the contrary, reality as viewed becomes more imposing and ineffable than ever. <p> The presence and primacy of the physical world is emphasised in these films through the unusual prominence of location, space, time and the world of objects. In Theory of Film Kracauer characteristically describes ' the tremendous importance of objects ', writing that ' the actor too is no more than a detail, a fragment of the matter of the world '( 1960, p. 45) and pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional figure-ground patterns usually conceal from view. '( ibid, p. 53) The first image of L'eclisse strikingly evokes this effect with a very surprising but entirely appropriate ' establishing shot ', a graphically dense composition showing desk lamp and cluttered objects flattened against a textured wall. <p> 18HF009 - L'eclisse( M. Antonioni -- 1962) <p> The subsequent pan then reveals part of the object-mass of this everyday yet somehow strange-looking reality to be the shirt sleeve-covered arm of a male body, which we now see staring off screen right yet in remaining immobile retains the appearance of an object. The lack of distinctions in such an image between form and content, subject and object, fiction and documentary, figure and ground, narration and reflexive thematising, demonstrate the central tenets of Antonioni 's re-conceived realism as both challenging and genuinely ' liberating ' in the sense Bazin described of deep focus and time 's entry into the filmic image. The result is aesthetic juxtapositions that, to borrow Kracauer 's view of cinema as objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal ' configurations of semi-abstract phenomena '( ibid, p. 54). Is there a better description, to take just one brief but very notable example, of the image in La notte when Lidia/Jeanne Moreau is transformed into a tiny figure barely visible in a far bottom-left slither of the frame, almost evicted from it by a giant expanse of stark concrete wall as seen from many floors above( a vantage point that may or may not be the apartment in which her husband Giovanni listlessly lies)? <p> 18HF010 - La notte( M. Antonioni -- 1961) <p> The majority of Antonioni 's ' semi-abstract phenomena ', including his most ' painterly ' images, do not in fact show something strange in itself. Rather, historical reality is photographed in a way that brings out both the startling modern beauty and nihilistic power of its spaces, no matter their intended purpose, all the while evidencing palimpsestic history. Originally designed for the cancelled 1942 World 's Fair to celebrate two decades of Italian fascism, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' economic miracle ' and Olympics showcase, yet as filmed it comes across as a highly ' science-fiction ' -like environment. In Il deserto rosso we see the other, less glamorous but equally futuristic-looking side of the modern Italian story with Ravenna 's heavy industry, high technology and environmental degradation. <p> As viewers of Antonioni 's films, our engagement with the world as presented on screen is one in which, to again borrow Merleau-Ponty 's words, ' the mind goes out through the eyes to wander among objects '( 1964, p. 166). To indulge the visual in all its confronting and enabling ambiguity is at the core both of this modernist cinema 's re-configured realism and its enormous seduction. Antonioni says that his visual technique is ' in moving from a series of images up to a state of things. '( qtd. in Tinazzi, 1996, p. xvii) The viewer also collates these images into a whole ' state of things '. Each of us brings not only customised order but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than usual, however, in the process we realise that such a manoeuvre remains both tenuous and viable only for an audience of one. What prevails is the space and time of the world in all its ambiguity as manifest on -- in fact as -- film. In his famous letter celebrating the director 's ' fragility ', Roland Barthes extols a ' discernment ' that never confuses ' meaning with truth '.( 1989, pp. 209 &; 210) This is the secret weapon of the still challenging freedom offered by Antonioni 's endlessly generative early ' 60s work, in which modernism and realism achieve their richest and most historically appropriate union. <p> A lecturer in Film, Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Newcastle, Australia, Dr Hamish Ford has written extensively on European cinema and Antonioni 's work. His most recent publication is the sole-authored book Post-War Modernist Cinema and Philosophy : Confronting Negativity and Time( Palgrave Macmillan, forthcoming October 2012)
