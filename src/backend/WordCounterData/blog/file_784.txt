5187241 <p> In this Blog Post I want to tell you about my future plans with the idea in mind that if you are free, you may want to join me. Most boondockers have a fairly similar travel agenda, so it 's possible our paths may cross over the next year and if you know my general plans, maybe we can try to get-together. Not only that, but if you are new to boondocking, maybe you can learn from how I make my plans and use them to make your own travel plans, modifying them to fit your needs. <p> While I have been a loner nearly all my life, as I get older I find myself looking for and enjoying the company of other people more and more. Steve has been camping with me for almost a year now and I have been so glad to have his company. This last summer numerous other people have joined me for varying lengths of time. Some stayed for a day, weeks or even for months, and I was blessed to have every person here. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible to camp with us. <p> But, you must understand that all these plans are very tentative. There is a saying among vandwellers that, " All my plans are written in Jello. " And that is certainly true for me. I am reluctant to make too many plans, or make them too far in advance, because I know that as soon as I do, something is likely to come up and change them. That might be unsettling for some people, but I love it! The reason I became a vandweller is because I cherish my freedom to do what I want, when I want to do it, wherever and however I want to do it. So I have minimal restrictions based on jobs, money or obligations. For the most part, I come and go as I please as the mood strikes me at any given moment. Not being able to make firm plans very far in advance is a very minor price to pay for all the freedom I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most, there are still limits on our freedom. One of the biggest is the weather. That is one of those things that helps remind me of my true place in the Universe. We mere humans have absolutely no control over the weather, so all the broad strokes of my plans have to be made with it in mind. So basically in the winter I will be in the desert southwest, and in the summer I will be at higher elevations in the mountains. <p> A second thing that restricts our freedom and controls our lives is the cost of gas. If gas remains expensive, or goes up even more next summer, I will have to limit my travel plans to fit my budget. One of the things on my Bucket List has been a trip to the Canadian Rockies. But it is such a long drive that if gas goes up too much, I ca n't afford to do it. But if gas is reasonably priced I may try to go up there next summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubber Tramp Rendezvous which I host every January in Quartzsite, Arizona. Since it is the most important event in my life, I have to make all my plans around it. I would highly recommend you do the same thing!! Last year we had our first summer Rubber Tramp Rendezvous in the Sierra National Forest, and it turned out well. However, it had fairly low attendance so I am not sure I will bother doing it again. If I do try it again, my summer will have to be planned around it as well. <p> With all those factors in mind, here are my tentative plans for the next year : <p> NOVEMBER : Quartzsite, AZ. The weather here in Victorville is just about perfect right now, so we will stay here for as long as it lasts. Once it starts to turn cold and windy, we will leave here and go to Quartzsite because it is generally about 10 degrees warmer there than here and has less wind. <p> DECEMBER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rangers at Quartzsite have gone around at the end of December and enforced the 14 day rule, asking people to leave. I think they know there is going to be a huge influx of people for the Big Tent RV Show, so they are clearing everyone out to make room for them. I do n't want to have a problem with the 14 day limit during the RTR, so I am planning on camping somewhere else in December. I 'm not sure where, we are hoping to find a place on the Colorado River near Blythe, CA, but we could go to Yuma, or Parker instead. <p> Your <p> Easy Ads. <p> Please go to the plugin admin page to paste your ad code. <p> JANUARY-FEBRUARY : Quartzsite, AZ. In the past I have not had a problem with Rangers even though I stayed in the same spot until the end of February, and then they enforced the 14 day rule, so I will probably be at the location of the RTR both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, AZ near Organ Pipe National Monument. It is gorgeous in the spring and I would love to go down there. Tucson and Phoenix( especially the Superstition Mountains) also have a beautiful wildflower bloom in February/March, so it is a possibility as well. <p> MARCH-APRIL : High Desert.. It 's hard to say where I might go next. The Arizona desert will be starting to get hot in March and April, so generally I will move up to higher elevation desert. Probably Pahrump, NV because I love it there in the spring. But one of my best friends has property in Northeast Arizona at 6500 feet, so I may go and spend time with him. Another great choice is New Mexico, where I have spent very little time. <p> JUNE-OCTOBER : Colorado. As of now, my plans are to spend next summer in Colorado, because I love it so much. The wildflower bloom in July is spectacular and the fall colors are magical. If there is a second Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always possible that gas prices could stay reasonable and I may make my run up to the Canadian Rockies. <p> NOVEMBER : Southern Utah. I ca n't put into words how much I love the Red Rock country of southern Utah with its five stunning National Parks. The first time I drove into Arches NP, it literally took my breath away and I actually wept over its beauty. November is the best time to visit Zion NP because the crowds have disappeared and you can drive into the Valley without riding on the Shuttle. There are also huge Cottonwood trees along the river and they are a beautiful yellow with fall colors then. It 's a spectacular photograph against the red rock walls of the canyon. <p> DECEMBER : Florida. It is a possibility that I will spend December in Florida visiting my mom, but it is too far away to have any firm plans. <p> JANUARY : Quartzsite, AZ. And the cycle is complete. <p> Here is a map of my tentative route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet mapping tool. According to Google, this is about a 2600 mile route, which is only about 220 miles a month. If I spread it out over a year, I can afford that! Notice that it is a giant loop so I never backtrack. Google choose freeway travel everywhere it could, which is fine with me. My goal is to move the trailer as easily as possible, then spend time in an area exploring in the van. <p> My very TENTATIVE travel plans for 2013 <p> Much of this is country I have been over before, so I can tell you with confidence that it is all spectacularly beautiful and if you get a chance you should join me if at all possible. <h> 14 Responses to My Travel Plans For the Next Year <p> I love your style of camping. Join in with campmates when the mood strikes and still have complete solitude when wanted. If my health holds up, I 'm sure I will join your tribe somewhere next your. Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like that you have posted a tentitive schedule for 2013. I am going to try to meet up with you and the tribe when coming through Colorado as I am from and currently living in the front range area. I 'm hoping to take the rest of the journey with you all! I 'm still trying to schedule/fit in the winter RTR as well, for a short visit so I can meet everyone, as money and time dictates my life right now. I have some health issues i am trying to resolve as well. Best wishes to everbody( vandwellers) who help make this lifestyle so special. Hope to be a part of this soon!! Randy <p> Randy, let 's consider it a date! I have a very good friend in Denver, so I will it 's certain I will be there if I do get to Colorado. I am a big fan of the Leadville area so i will be there for sure. But, I know some of the people I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be short. I hope you can make it to the RTR, the more the better! Bob <p> Carl, March is a good time to be leaving Florida, before the heat gets too bad. I 've made that trip across the southeast several times and it is a very nice drive. Generally you can find Dispersed camping in National Forests to spend the night in along the way. I 'm looking forward to meeting you! <p> I 'm planning on meeting up with you in Quartzite area in Dec/Jan sometime. Looking forward to it! I was really touched by how sensitive you are to the utter beauty of Nature -- that happens to me, too, and it 's nice to know it happens to others, too <p> Sayward, I think it 's the normal condition of humans to be awestruck and tuned into nature, unfortunately too many of us have had it trained out of us. I checked out your blog and I ca n't tell you how envious I am that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?) is probably #1 on my bucket list outside of North America. I see Patagonia is one of your tentative trips, I can relate as I think it would be #2 on my list. China and New Zealand would be right up there also. <p> I ca n't tell you how much I admire your courage to take life by the horns and LIVE it! I am looking forward to meeting you as well. You can tell me how they floated those boulders into place in Peru! Bob <p> Still hoping to make RTR. Meanwhile, I was interested to read your perspective on southern Utah as that has been high on my tentative list of stopover spots on my way down from Montana. Robert Witham recently posted.. On building cairns and unplugging <p> Robert, I love Southern Utah so much! It is just spectacular country. And there is a huge variety from desert, to National Forests, Red Rock, slot canyons and incredible rafting on the Colorado. You can Mountain bike, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And so much of it is totally unique, there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world. <p> I could spend the rest of my life in Utah and Colorado and be quite happy! Bob <p> I 've moved to Quartzsite, AZ. You all have a standing invitation to my camp ; come one, come all!! If you are on Interstate 10 From Blythe or Phoneix : take Interstate 10 and get off on Exit 19, turn RIGHT if you are coming from Blythe, LEFT if you are coming from Phoenix. That will dead-end on E. Kuehn Street, turn LEFT, keep going until you hit the roadblock then turn RIGHT onto the dirt road and reset your odometer. Our camp is.45 miles down the road on the RIGHT. From Parker or Yuma on 95, south of town( and the overpass on Interstate 10) is a street light. If you are coming from Parker, turn LEFT onto Kuehn Street, if you are coming from Yuma turn RIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turn RIGHT onto the dirt road and reset your odometer. Our camp is.45 miles down the road on the RIGHT. <p> Products I Recommend for Barebones Vandwelling <h> Probably the most essential thing to get started vandwelling is a good mattress so you can get a good nights sleep. If you are looking for a cheap rv mattress, checkout MattressInsider.com. They have most RV sizes( including short sizes) and they will even make a custom size for you. <p> If you do n't have solar in your van, the next best thing is to charge your house battery from your alternator. But that still may not provide you with enough power if you do n't drive much. I highly recommend you purchase rechargeable batteries and a charger. By recharging AA, AAA, C and D batteries, you can meet many of your light and entertainment needs without any power. Some examples are LED lights and lanterns, a portable radio and D powered fans. You should be able to charge them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and plugging the charger into the inverter. Or, you can put the charger into a backpack and go spend the afternoon at a library and plug it into one of their outlets. These are the batteries and charger I have been using for several years and they have worked extremely well for me. Enloops is generally regarded as the best brand, and I like this charger because it is fairly fast and will charge AA, AAA, C, D and 9 volt batteries. I also recommend having an extra set so when one runs out, you can just put in a fully
