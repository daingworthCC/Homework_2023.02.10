5156141 <p> Mr. Gray is out for the day, but he left this new machinima from Slightly Impressive for us to watch. The short, 2-minute video presents us with some of the other Sha players can find in Pandaria, such as the Sha of Fanboyism and the Sha of Elitism. Oddly, none of these other Sha have been incorporated into the game lore yet, possibly because they afflict players more than NPCs. <p> The production of the video is pretty simple overall, but it seems like it was a lot of fun to make for Griffter and his ensemble of voice actors. Each cycle of the joke gives an opportunity for more humor and I 'd say, for the most part, the script and the actors deliver. The light and amusing commentary on the player base is nothing new of course, but I always appreciate a new take on it. <p> My favorite Sha is the last one -- I wo n't say what it is so I do n't spoil the joke, but what 's yours? Interested in the wide world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WoW Moviewatch! Have suggestions for machinima we ought
