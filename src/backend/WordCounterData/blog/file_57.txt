5113741 <h> November 17th, 2012 by Craig <h> Singers Who Survive in Business? <p> This week we 're looking at the ' business ' of music <p> For many vocalists, singing is more than just a hobby, it is their income. So, a certain amount of business sense is essential if one is to survive in the formidable world of the music industry. As singers, we have to get used to the idea of our voice as a saleable commodity with value. However, with something so close to our hearts, it can sometimes be difficult to separate business from pleasure. This week we 'd really like to hear your thoughts on this. <p> So the question is : What do you think are the most important attributes needed for a singer to survive in the business-side of singing? <p> Last week I asked : Is the use of extreme vocal effects such as screaming, belting or heavy distortion damaging to the voice? <p> Joshua Drane wrote... <p> " I believe so especially in the case of screaming( screamo) or " heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some who incorporate what is known as " vocal fry " to scream. That is a technique that helps vocal range if properly practiced, so in that case, no. Belting, I do n't know, I hope not, I do it all of the time. I do suggest a proper warm up before attempting and of course exercising the VOX to maintain control over your VOX ". <p> Matt Colhoun commented... <p> " Technique is KEY! Screaming, by definition, is not good for you voice. But there are techniques, like " vocal fry ", that may help ". <p> Lorrianne Crolla wrote... <p> " You really have to force yourself to not blow out your voice in all the excitement of the night. I 'm a belter with a very demanding set list so we break up the night into three 45 minute sets, I slip in easy songs between the really difficult songs and go easy at the start of the night. I 've learned to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in-ear monitors so I no longer have to sing loud to hear myself. Have n't blown my voice out in a long time ". <p> Joannie Penman responded... <p> " Warming up and warming down are essential ". <p> Great comments this week guys, see you next time. <p> C x <p> VN:F 1.9.131145 <p> Rating : 0( from 0 votes) <h> About Craig <p> Craig Antony is gaining attention across the UK as a singer-songwriter whose music has been described as " driving, engaging and passionate ".
