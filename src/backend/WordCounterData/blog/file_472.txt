5155541 <p> It 's easy to say take care of our earth to kids. It 's much harder to say why in a way they can understand. This wonderful early reader book from Creative Teaching Press does a wonderful job at explaining why we should take care of our earth in very simple terms for early readers. For example, they mention that the bear lives in the forest. So, let 's take care of the forest. The words and illustrations are simple, poignant and comprehensive for small children. I have reviewed Creative Teaching material before and I am always impressed by their support for emergent readers. It is so important to build a young child 's confidence in reading at an early age and the repetitive words and predictable stories are excellent ways for a child to get excited about reading. There are additional fun activities in the back of this 16-page book for additional learning. For classroom discounts, Creative Teaching Press
