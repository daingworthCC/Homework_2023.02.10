5136641 <h> A Little More Info on the Raptor and Libya <p> Air Force Secretary Michael Donley this week shed a tiny bit more light on the whole mystery surrounding the lack of an appearance by the F-22 Raptor in the skies above Libya during Operation Odyssey Dawn, saying the plane would have been used if it was needed. <p> Donley told a reporter at a Tuesday morning breakfast in Washington that the plane would have flown in Libya if its capabilities were viewed as a requirement for the operation. When pressed for more on what capabilities were needed, he waited a few seconds before saying, " multirole, maybe? " <p> This makes a lot of sense given the fact that the Libyan op turned into an air-to-ground fight pretty fast and the F-22 is optimized for high-end air-to-air combat. <p> This comes about a week after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told lawmakers that the F-22 was left out of Libya due to the fact that it was based too far from the operation compared to older fighters that were already based in Europe. <p> Former Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that explanation and offered his own take here. <h> Join the Conversation <p> Lets see three weeks, three excuses for the no show of the F-22 in Libya. Lets review, week one. Communications problems with NATO aircraft and needed a Global Hawk in the air to communicate with US forces and each other. OK Week Two. Only deployed only in the CONUS, no infrastructure in NATO for the F-22. This of course ignores the deployment of the Navy 's E/F-18G Growler which effectively shut down the Libyan Air Defense System, note there is no reported firings of a single ADM so far in the Libyan air war. Now week three, well we would have sent it, if was needed, but really not as a multi-role fighter. Lets see the NATO altitude for ground attack in Libya is 15,000 feet, it see all that is required is a bomb truck. Our smart weapons at that altitude are not very. The higher you release a weapon the greater the CPE. At 15,000 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being measured by Zip Codes. <p> The 45 2000 lb. bombs release by the B-2 's( at classified altitudes) missed their targets by so much that when it rains a couple of times in Libya the country will have it 's own lake district, for future Islamic Poets. <p> At 15,000 ft. lasers no longer work, moisture in the air deflects the light, and JADAMS II 's go back to being plane old dumb bombs with a $50,000.00 kit on them. So I guess the F-22 with two bomb bays would n't be all that effective. Which begs the question, just what can the F-22 do for the US air efforts that need doing now that is not being done by an existing platform and done a lot cheaper? <p> Just a bunch of cr** in trying ti justify a major procurement screw up. Anyone knows what happened to the Stryker Mobile Gun Unit, you remember the auto loading 105mm canon on a wheeled Stryker that was to be a " Game Changer "? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recoil, the M-4A4 has about 3 lbs. the M014 about 16 lbs. and the WW II M-1 19 lbs of recoil. Is just more then the GI can handle. Also there are accuracy problems, to small of a blast radius, problems with how log it takes for the optical sights to find and fix a target and no build in 5.56 mm weapon for self defense of the operator, which mean the XM-25 gunner has to carry two weapons or an additional 9 lbs., to a ground pounder that a lot of extra weight. <p> we have see in libya one excellent aircraft, who was enter in libya with all defense system and libyan planes( yes not recent), he have make and have bomb target at the ground, that 's the french rafale. All US airplanes have waiting the tomahawk bombing, and in all time they do n't will move because libya have SAM systems Some f-22 was suffisant for destroy libyan plane, he was furtive or no? no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke, just one propaganda of US superiority.And now we see the f-22 receive some f-35 furtive " paint ", why? furtiv fighter jet was one big joke, one f-15 silent or one rafale was largely suffisant and they have the technology for catch one " furtive " jet... BIG JOKE nothing more <p> Wake UP!!! F-22 is DEAD!!!!! Stealth is DEAD!!!! Thank you " General "( I am Worthless " Merrill Anthony " Tony ") McPeak and of course Admiral " We must have 1000 additional 19knt Afterburning Ships, so to stop the madness I am now the Chairman of the JCS " Mullins, and of course the Prime " Give me additional Funds at 15% Profit after cost " Integrators for totally SCREWING Up the Air Force and Navy with your " Let put everything into Stealth "!!! Your Legacy Continues!!!!! What ever happened to General 's with courage??? For instance, Curtis LaMay, and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! The Folks we have in these positions now are Ass Kissers and leaches to the Integrators!!!! They can not make a decision in regards to anything, in fact you can not touch a F-22, F-16, without contacting Lockheed for Permission!!! The Military Has turned into a Political Machine instead of a " Department of War " that when the Secretary Shows up people listen... We have to be Politically Correct!!! Go Politics, Go Wall Street!!! Let 's purchase another useless bomber!! What the Hell is wrong with the B-52H???? We can hit all the Grass Huts and Camel Depots from Miles out?? <p> We all fully know now why they Took the " A " off the F/A-22 as orginally intended.... It can not attack anything, it is now an A/A Specialist against High Value Enemy Fighters that now see the F-22 coming with their new APG-79 type radar and IR type sensors, that is also utlized on the SA-21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will see the F-22 platfroms at the front gate shortly!!! PS.... 20 Years and no Connectivity, you have to love that.! <p> Byron, come back to us when you actually understand how the JDAM works. You do not. <p> " Our smart weapons at that altitude are not very. The higher you release a weapon the greater the CPE. At 15,000 ft. the JADAM II with a 2.5 meter CPE goes into being measured by Zip Codes. " <p> 1. JDAM is an INS weapon kit that just happens to use GPS as a back up. 2. The dropping aircraft first has to have a good INS fix. 3. Some aircraft( B-1, B-2 and others) use a radar fix or an off-set radar fix when dropping the JDAM. This gets CEP down to 2 -- 3 meters -- or less. 4. Flight time is around a minute or less for this weapon. Your zip code and altitude theory is flat-out wrong. JDAM has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CEP stays about the same. <p> Not good to depend on Schwartz and Donley. These are the guys that fib in front of Congress stating the F-35 is critical to national defense. <p> Again for some needing a ride on the clue-train about the F-22. When you actually have one about how the F-22, and the AN/ALR-94 actually work, maybe you will start to understand things. The JDAM equipped F-22 would have been find for fixed and known very long range SA-5 sites. These are not mobile sites. Ditto with some of the low band radar. This is what you use to take down threats early in a war. The F-22 and the F-35 are both multi-role aircraft. One is primarily air-to-air and the other is primarily air-to-ground. Well, assuming the F-35, with only 4 percent flight testing done and a cost that is more than the F-22, ever gets fielded properly. Donley and Schwartz were wrong about that too, but hey, media sources still quote them as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes stuff up as he goes. He will be completely unable to provide ANY citation regarding the type of weapons actually dropped against ground targets. As you said, why would you drop laser-guided munitions which require a painter on the ground or a relatively stable airborne designator, when you can drop INS/GPS bombs on *known navigational coordinates? * <p> Byron -- @ELP is exactly right regarding the JDAM. The JDAM is an INS weapon with GPS aiding and the higher the altitude, the more time the GPS has the opportunity to lock on making CEP( not CPE) smaller. If the JDAM were only a ballistic weapon then your theory might hold some water, but even the oldest aircraft in our inventory can deliver ballistic weapons with a fair amount of accuracy -- in the 10s of meters. Additionally, laser designators do not have problems with absorption at those altitudes. They operate fine on clear days... you might want to check your data before making some of these radical statements. <p> As for EJ Remmington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much still alive. However, a better argument might be that we can no longer rely on stealth technology alone, as was proven in the air war over Kosovo. That is why stealth is merely one tool in the toolbag of airpower tricks. <p> This is pure speculation, but has anyone considered the possibility that the reason the F-22 was n't used is because the risks outweighed the benefits? <p> What I mean is that the F-22 still has some very sensitive technologies on board and that there was no compelling reason( other than a political statement) to use the F-22 in the operations in Libya when all of the other aircraft in the inventory can accomplish the job without incident. That is with the exception of the F-15 that had an unforeseen aircraft malfunction. A person in their right mind would only use the F-22 when absolutely needed and would n't risk showing any potential adversary the true capabilities of the F-22. This hypothesis finds itself inline with some of Lt Gen Deptula 's comments regarding the F-22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, although there may have been some political benefits of using the F-22 in Libya, like quieting some of the skeptics in congress or those in this column. That is no reason to show the cards up the USAF 's sleeves. <p> Deptula and Schwartz need to find a new Job at Lockheed Martin. They are both a complete waste as Air Force General 's. The DOD is not looking for Leaders ; they are looking and currently have Politically Correct Nightmares. They allow the Integrators to Drive the Battlespace. Another reason why they TOOK THE " A " away from the F/A-22 as originally designed. The SA-21 GROWLER / S400 Triumph Long Range TABM/SAM along with the IR and Radar data currently integrated on the new and old advisors platforms fully exploits the F-22 from the Augmenter to the Inlet. They have had 12 Years to exploit Stealth Technology and they have. The " Generals ",( I am sorry, Integrator " Talking Heads ") are blowing Smoke up Congress 's A &; &.; JSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Bring another thousand), only worse, they are continue to manufacture this none conductive, pylon hanging worthless piece of garbage. <p> The EA-18G has not been deployed yet.... LOL... It is still in Test. BTW : This platform is the only serious manned platform that has a path into a TST. JSF and F-22 do not have this capability. The Air Force and General "( I am Worthless " Merrill Anthony " Tony ") McPeak decided during his tenure that we did not need the E/F-111 or the B-52 SPJ Platform. He decided in his infinite wisdom,( including screw up the Air Force Uniform for a while), made the decision that Stealth was the way to GOOO!!! YEEHAAW! Now the Navy has to escort Air Force Platforms into High Threat Targets with the EA-6B or in the Future EA-18G. Either way the Air Force now lives in a Fantasy land. All our adversities have had over 12 years to exploit Stealth and they have completely. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the Australians RAAF see the light. They are purchasing EA-18G for this very reason. <p> Hey Byron does the Libyan ministry of propaganda pay good? I might need a new job one of these days. <p> It has already been covered but the accuracy of the JDAM is n't effected by altitude. The Stryker MGS was never a " game changer " but it is in service and proving useful fire support. The XM25 has some kick to it but I rather doubt it has 69 lbs of felt recoil. <p> Meanwhile why should we bother flying our F-22As in circles over Libya? It would be wasting hours on the airframe and nothing else. <p> Are you the same person as EJ Remmington? You sound a like and you 're claims are pretty nonsensical too. The F/A-22 designation was an effort to better advertise the aircraft 's ground attack capabilities to politicians too busy wasting money on pet projects to buy the number of F-22s we need to replace the F-15. <p> There is a story behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be two variants, the F-18 and A-18, yet technological improvements allowed one variant to have the features of both. Rather than just calling it the F-18( or A-18) the Navy went with the F/A designation in order not to piss off either the fighter or attack pilot community that was still rather separate at that time. Although technically the definition should probably have been A/F-18. <p> The EA-18 Growler is on its first deployment Mr. Miller. You should bring yourself up to date. That is not to say that the airplane does n't have a few issues but it is out of test. In electronic warfare everyday is a test to keep up to date. Was in the community for a long time -- in fact when the EF111 came out and the USAF came to Whidbey for an assist in operational uses. <p> As for the EA6B -- USAF crews are integrated within the Navy Command structure and fly the EA6B out of Whidbey Island. Pay a visit and you will be blue all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction -- well I guess it is all about being purple. McPeak was n't the sharpest person around ecept with his ego. And it ws something to behold!!!! <p> The question we should be asking is why the f*** did this country waste the money on an aircraft they are not going to use, ca n't communicate with other platforms or even deploy to Afghanistan. This is possibly the worst waste of tax payer money. It 's like buying your kid a brand new toy and then throwing it away. We really need to get all these f*cking idiots out of capitol hill and get some people in who do n't have their head up their ass and actually do something other then when election time comes around. <p> Why would putting hours on the airframes even matter at this point. Most of these aircraft probably have less then 10 hrs on the frame anyways. An aircraft is made to fly not be a hangar queen its entire life. <p> First the US 's AO was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't include Tripoli. If any of you bothered to notice that the video of all this is very suspect. Some of it appears to be recycled from Afghanistan and when there is what is clearly a Libyan shot it is most often a single vehicle and I at least have see nor heard of any building damaged or destroyed by the Americans. All of the reported structural damage has been done by French and other NATO aircraft. <p> Last weekend a US raid killed 13 rebel fighters. The aircraft, believed to be an F-16 was operations at 15,000 ft. plus above cloud cover. The pilot had no visual, not FAC on the ground and was operating off pre-assigned target coordinates. This is not air support but blind bombing. <p> I would suggest that some of you actually go to the, mil site and look up stuff but, naw then you might be able to give a reasonably good argument rather then you personal attacks, so just stay stupid and keep attacking. <p> The F22 is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing prep work for deployment. I remember that story, so clearly they thought they might be relevant and possibly deployed. So the notion that it was too far away is BS. The problem there is that was testimony a military officer gave to Congress. That matters. It was n't true. <p> Now given the ad hoc come as you are party this was, clearly the NCA did n't give the military much heads up. So we went with what we more or less had in theater. Nothing wrong with that, of course other than it is n't accomplishing the stated goal which is to get rid of Qaddafi. Gen Ham today said it is very unlikely the rebels can topple Qaddafi and even raised the notion of ground forces of some nation being required. <p> Beyond Libya though, obviously the whole of the middle east is sort of up in the air. We do n't know what government, if any, could be next. It looks like Yemen is most likely, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't know and on top of that, we do n't know how Iran or Syria might react, how this might affect Israel, and clearly have no idea how this all plays out, it seems pretty obvious to this layman that the USAs alleged premier air dominance fighter should at least be deployed in the region just in case. I doubt the skies over Virginia will be compromised. <p> I agree... thought they were still in test at Whidbey Island and had not yet been deployed. My mistake. However, the Air Force should have their own platform for EW or purchase their own EA-18G 's in the future. The Air Force keeps their EWO Officers up to date thanks to the Navy. However, under the current conditions both the Air Force and Navy should jointly develop EA capabilities moving forward. The Air Force 's answer to all issues is stealth, until you dig into the current threats. Once digging begins they discover the Air Force needs EA and EW Support, thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. However, they would rather continue to drop funds in the bottom-less pit of purchasing platforms such as the JSF and F-22 that are now Targets. Maybe they will purchase our old EA-6B. We could call it FMS... LOL... I knew Merrill myself. He was a waste of humanity. General Creech, Fogelman and Russ were the Best in the Business at " Killing People and Breaking Thinks "!!! <p> Byron, for someone posting on a Defense News/Technologies website, you are remarkably ignorant of how USAF weapons systems operate, particularly the JDAM system. You might consider doing a little studying/research before you make completely false statements... as you are just embarrasing yourself. And if you are not, I am embarassed for you. <p> The F-22 will never be flown in combat, we have had 3 wars and usually systems are rushed in to at least put them through their paces. But the F-22 have never flown anywhere near them. And it never will. <p> There is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin the F-22 is fleet of prototypes for a failed design. <p> Good God people. The F-22 is real and here so get over it. Are you going to wait for all the F-15s to break in half? Or maybe we can just keep adding pounds on the F-16? I mean what 's the point of all this hatred towards the 22 and 35? It 's not a blue marble that you take to your friend 's house to show that you have a blue marble. And in 10 years when there is some other threat more sophisticated you will be the same people complaining that we have no plan to address it? These are enormously complicated weapons that happen to fly. Its a miracle they work at all. <p> Lets see, beside the really lousy PR from the USAF brass and the idiocy of most extreme F-22 advocates( on both sides), lets look realistically. <p> A F-15E that was already in theater could carry AMRAAM, Sidewinder, A targeting pod, GPS/LGB bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! The air threat was, shall we say minimal, or would non-existant be better? A F-22 can carry AMRAAM and SDB1 for use against fixed targets and would have to be deployed to the theater. Yeah I know which aircraft I want for the mission of flying around over the front. Those SDBs are going to be awesome against hardened aircraft shelters and tanks! <p> Clearly the F-22 was critical for success. The hundreds of, I mean tens of, OK zero losses to date seem to support that, not! <p> yeah, you have learn the f-22 propaganda, that 's good. But now, why no f-22 in europe? to many enemy in america? canada? mexico? brasil? why f-22 do n't fly with others foreign aircraft? why foreign aircraft need cut their radars technology when one f-22 was in the sky? he was furtive or no? if he was so excellent, why USDpt stop it? USA will use it against N.Korea and iran? what is aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more old <p> Why american do n't understand that was just one big propaganda of power, just for have the better generation? saying he was furtive for give the sentiment to others country, we can be every where and you ca n't know that( scary no? propaganda of power no?) Now others country make 5th gen fighters, and now USA envisaged one 6th gen, when we know f-22 and f-35 programs, be happy for the next. I 'm sure in 30 years the f-22 was furtive but now that 's over, all technology have evolute, this technology is capable to follow one furtive jet, not the same emission like one f-16, but she can see it Just wait when the f-35 was in service in europe and you know at this moment the reality of the furtive jet, one big propaganda today like the russian or chinese jet. the real question : why the f-22? <p> Actually it was the McDonnell Douglas/Northrop YF-17 that was in competition with the GD YF-16 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that to replace the A-4, A-7, and F-4. <p> Attemping to covert an F-22 for carriers would cost way too much time and money, and then everybody and their mother will be pissed because it 's taking too long and taking taxpayers money and blah blah blah. <p> Army Gen. Carter Ham, head of U.S. Africa Command, told a Thursday hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee that the military situation in Libya has developed into a stalemate. Gen. Ham 's assessment may actually be a bit optimistic, as there were reports yesterday of " mass panic " among the rebels near Ajdabiya and their total defeat seems more likely than a decisive victory over Gaddafi 's army. <p> I am well aware of the history of the F/A-18 program and indeed the YF-17 was selected for further development over a variant of the YF-16. However the Navy originally intended to purchase two variants, the A-18 and F-18. These were specialized for their respective roles. Advancements in technology made this unnecessary however and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch. <p> During the time the Navy had separate " attack " and " fighter " communities. So they went with the F/A-18 designation to please both groups of pilot and created the VFA Strike Fighter Squadrons. So the F/A-18 began to replace the remaining A-4s, A-7s, and F-4s. <p> In the late ' 80s the Navy 's plan for their future aircraft included the NATF and A-12 Avenger II. The A-12 had been selected over the upgraded A-6F Intruder. Yet the A-12 was canceled in 1991 and the A-X program was started. When the NATF was canceled the A-X program became A/F-X and included requirements for additional air-to-air capabilities. <p> During the ' 90s the F-14D Super Tomcat faced serious opposition, and the Super Hornet was proposed as a lower cost alternative pending the introduction of the A/F-X. The Super Hornet was selected over proposals derived from the F-14D and a few years later the A/F-X was canceled due to budget issues. Now the F/A-18E and F/A-18F are the main aircraft of USN aviation. Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced by the F/A-XX. <p> The Super Hornet is a good aircraft and certainly will serve us well for the foreseeable future. Yet I do believe we will need the F/A-XX by the mid 2020s or so. <p> Info from some buddies in the area say the low flying A10 's have accounted for more dammage to lybian forces than any aircraft or country but of course no one politicaly wants it to get out that the least desired most basic design aircraft in inventory is doing most of the effective work and destruction, AC130 kills are not being reported either. The so called outdated birds of prey that generals say are no longer needed are whooping but over the higher priced toys and no one wants it to be known for fear it will kill thier arguments for more tech and gear. <p> I wonder if you know how JDAMs actually work. They do NOT need laser guidenace, they use INS with GPS for reference signal so weapons always knows where it is at. JDAMs and SDBs are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant impact on accuracy. <p> What do you base the accuarcy of the B-2 strikes on? I have my doubts about your synopsis. <p> There is plenty of infrastructue in the European theater for F-18 airframes and any comparison to the F-22 is moot. <p> The F-22 is a F-15 A/B/C/D replacement, not a strike acft. As you pointed out, Lybian defenses were rolled back easily mitigating the need for the F-22. The excuse given about communications is just BS since the F-22 performs very well in exercise with US and allies participating. I do not know why the DoD thought we would buy that reason. <p> So... what does this have to do with JDAM accuracy and theory of operation Byron? Nothing. According to your last post I have to assume you 're telling us an F-16 dropped an unguided munition and mistakenly killed 13 rebel fighters due entirely to the inaccuracy of the weapon? <p> I assume you 're talking about the incident outside of Brega. This was mistaken identity of a vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim of pre-dertermined coordinates on an erratically moving vehicle column of light trucks somewhat dubious, but no more so than most of your claims. <p> Agreed, let 's not use a highpowered chemical laser to trim our facial hair and show our potential enemies just what our strengths/weaknesses are, as well as give them the opportunity to capture one for further study/use against us( Russians did n't mind trying to go in covertly to Israel under the guise of being Lebonese, who says they 'd be opposed to " loaning " GaDaffy some equipment to drop one of these birds?) <p> " Yes, why develop this thing that discharges a projectile inaccurately and takes a minute to reload? Our crossbows work just fine " Last words before the rifle was refined and used to kill the guy that said this. <p> Right on... I was clarifying what Mr. " Viper " so eloquently stated. I think the Super Tomcat and Attack Super Tomcat would have done just as well as the Super Hornet if they went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress does n't want it know that when they finally retire, they get 100% pay for life care of Social Security, and the rest of us Americans get the big screw. <p> I 've always through that AC-130 's should get lighter, better weapons, radar absorbent materials( if they do n't already) and enhanced optics &; targeting equipment to make them more effective regardless of weather( can not think of a way to have them operate in daylight except if 100% certain all AA weapons nuetralized) and that A-10s should be networked to make them even more effective at the brilliant job they already do. Neutralize the AA and use the 22 's to maintain air superiority, and let the ACs and A-10s wreak holy hell on the enemy. Booyah. <p> Nothing wrong with the B-52H in the right environment( other than it is 50 years old and parts can be an issue). I would not want to take one into a heavily defended target. <p> Considering how well the bomber force has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers being useless shows how much you do not know. <p> Cotact Lockheed fpor permission? Where in the blazes do you get that? These are not leased acft. Never worked F-22s, but did F-16s and the only time I recall contacting manufacturer was due to a cracked wing that had to be replaced( in the field at Kunsan). But then again any time you have major failure like that you would contact depot or manufacturer. <p> Stealth is a lonnnng way from dead. If this had been Syria or Iran instead of Libya you would have seen the F-22. <p> You wrote : " Last weekend a US raid killed 13 rebel fighters.

" article below, it looks as if in the end looney, isolated, besieged, outnumbered, abandoned, unarmed dictator Kaddhaffi will still defeat three nuclear powers + the rest of N.A.T.O. + all other Arab forces + all U.N.O. forces TOGETHER AND SIMULTANEOUSLY!!! <p> How does any soldier or mil buff POSSIBLY conceive such a vision : Total defeat and humiliation of the Western and Middle Eastern Hemisphere by Kaddhaffi, as if Kaddhaffi is some reincarnated Rommel? What next? Will someday 's headlines be like " Panic Of Kaddhaffi 's Counter-Attack Grips Pentagon "? A few weeks ago all this would still have sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when Kaddhaffi threatened to invade the Netherlands), but now, in this present conflict, I 'm REALLY NOT so sure anymore how to place my bets... <p> I guess it 's true what they say : It 's much, much easier to defend than to attack... <p> But with such a disproportion of forces, too? Did the U.S. brass stand too close to a F-$$, or what else turned them into such resounding, epic, FAT FAILURES??? Modern U.S. American generals -- EVEN MUSSOLINI WOULD FEEL ASHAMED OF THEM!!!!! <p>( And guess which neutral, economic and military Super-Power on the sideline will be THE ONLY buyer of A-L-L of Kaddhaffi 's oil next? Was that part of " Israel " ' s / France 's / the U.S.A. 's / N.A.T.O.

What is a retreating loyalist vehicle( = a " legitimate " target) to a Western fighter-bomber pilot now, is a pursuing rebel vehicle -- occupying exactly the same spot! -- ten minutes later. According to French newspapers, THAT 'S how the second attack by mistake came about : It happened while the rebel frontline forces were storming too fast into Kaddhaffi-held territory, and N.A.T.O. was n't kept updated enough. N.A.T.O. was still looking at old maps. <p> All of which makes me wonder : Ca n't N.A.T.O. dispense a single, old spare radio or second-hand mobile phone for all the rebels, so that the latter can constantly transmit the fluctuating front-line back? Or do they prefer to just drop another half billion $ worth of ordnance blindly? What else are all the rumoured Western special forces doing in Libya, if not observing and broadcasting / F.A.C.ing from the front : Sight-seeing? <p> No one may have noticed, but you 're absolutely right about that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.E.P. of I.N.S.-guided ammunition REALLY increases with distance / flight length, and not just by a few meters per every 10 kilometers covered.

But are there no other, professional pilots or electronics experts on this Web-site, only former infantrymen?) <p> Continuing to purchase the JSF at $150,000,000.00 + and rising each times 2600... Humm, there is no reason to purchase a manned Aircraft when we have JASSM-ER, ALCM 's, Predator, Global Hawk, etc... etc... We could build thousands of long-range standoff missiles that can Kill IADS of any Country. Stealth is dead!!! F-22 is dead!!! and JSF is DEAD!!! Spending a 10+Trillion over the life cycle of the system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Admiral Mullins( Stealth Ships + a 1000 after burning Ships/Targets and hired the President of Northrop Grumman Ship Building) Navy is outrageous. Gates needs to fire these two idiots immediately. <p> Well I agree with what you say but I do n't see the need to develop a EW bird for the USAF The cost is out of site, heaven and earth and when you start to radiate stealth is kind of out the window anyway,( Remember initial pilot training is a joint venture these days as well). The EA6B with USAF pilot and ECMOs works and when you think of making the F35 an Electronic bird you could have more than enough Growlers for everyone to go around. And tactics and comms etc would all mesh. I would guess the EF18 G has yet to prove itself although they did take the 3 they had deployed them to the Med area with other assets. The rest I am sure is classified. <p> I remember very vividly in 1972 when the EA6B first came out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the B52 strikes in LB2. Why -- it was new and sure as heck did n't want to lose one. Did n't even do it for ourselves. Kind of the F22 story all over again. Frankly we did n't need them in Libya. If we can not dance with F15 and F18s with a third rate country we better come come home anyway cause no F22 is going to make a difference. As per the electronic environment you never know who the operators are on the ground and do you want to use your front line machines when you do n't have to. BIG cat and mouse game with that stuff. In this case I do n't think we needed the F22. Between the F18 and F15 there weere plenty o assets on the ground to get any job done. Regards. <p> Yet these same incorrigible invaders and oil-thieves hypocritically complain that Kaddhaffi commits war crimes... <p> Each day I feel more DISGUSTED of N.A.T.O. and of U.N.O. and more inclined towards Russia and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the will to confront the Fascist, Neo-Colonialistic West( whatever their internal affairs. That 's not my business). <p> No matter which of our very potent and expensive " war toys " we use it does not matter when we are in a fight we have little to no business being in, especially carrying a multi-Trillion Dollar Deficit! Charity begins at home. Keep the toys home and mind our own damned business. First order of business? Paydown or payoff the national debt and get it off of my childrens ' backs, and their children 's backs as well. Darn fools in Washington D.C.need to wake up! <p> The air war campaign in Libya is not a serious test of the capabilities of any of the aircraft you mention. Of course the Rafale and the F-15 would be useful in that situation. A P-47 Thunderbolt may also be useful. Advanced " stealth "( furtive) capability and supersonic cruise was not essential for success. Here is another interpretation of the latest excuse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wasting them on third world cesspool police actions. This would not even rank as a difficult combat training deployment. Since we did n't buy enough F-22s, we need to conserve flying hours and spares for when they can serve a useful purpose, like intimidating clear and present dangers to the United States of America. I assure everyone that those dangerous potential adversaries do not regard the F-22 as a joke. <p> Hi ffb. I ca n't find much fault with what you say, I sometimes tire of your WW II Nazi analogies, I never the less see a different insight then what we been from the American right wing. You antiquated opinions are shared by many relocated europeans this side of the pond to be sure ffb, so I 'm not unfamiliar with them. <p> Here is a question ffb that may but up you alley, why are the Germans acting the way they currently are? <p> I can think of a couple of reason. The Germans moved a lot of " gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were real quick to get Deutsche Bank assets flown out of Egypt early. Also it is widely assumed in the US that Germany for decades have ignored all of the embargoes placed by the UN in this are looking out for Krout #1. <p> Another opinion on this is from an art dealer who is involve in recovering stole art I know who says Mubarak never took Germany to the Hague and pursued reclaiming the looted antiquities that Germany looted from Egypt in the 19th and first half of the 20th. Century. She was tell me that ALL of the stolen art and antiquities taken from Iraq during the 2003 US invasion that have bee found/recovered have had German finger prints all over them. <p> Any thoughts on this ffb. <p> To Boomer. I have heard the same things regarding the A-10 and AC-130J 's. It would appear that the productivity of mother Air Force and Naval aviation has been far less then expected. <p> You buddies on the USS Florida though sounds like they did a great job. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first hour, and has fired almost all of there 154 TLAM magazine before retiring to CONUS for a reload. <p> Finally what will be next weeks excuse of why the F-22 did n't make it to Libya? <p> One source that I have maintains the a squadron of F-22 's( 6 F-22 's?) home based in Virginia as well as the two E/F-18G 's that re deployed to Italy by the Navy so they could be used against Libyan air defenses. were in Iraq just before the Libyan air campaign, but the F-22 's quickly went back home. <p> Some Europeans are not so trustworthy and have demonstrated a tendancy towards espionage on the F-22 for business reasons, not self defence. The US taxpayers spent a lot getting the F-22 to be effective and we are just trying to stretch the time it takes to be obsolete. No, I do n't think there are enemies of the US in the list you mention If you mean does not fly in joint exercises with foreign aircraft, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean they do n't fly against foreign aircraft in actual or mock combat, that is partially true, but again, why should we give away all our capability? I <p> I am not sure what you mean by cutting foreign radar technology, but if you are saying there have been restrictions imposed on foreign radars during joint exercises, I am not aware of that. He may have been furtive, yes, but sometimes F-22s are " wearing " a special radar target to radiate like a less furtive jet. It 's a game. When a lot of money is involved in purchasing a product and others want the money for their product, there can be personal issues, regional issues, even cheating lies and corruption involved to explain irrational behavior. As a result, good products are stopped. If it comes to defending ourselves from N. Korea or Iran, or intimidating them from aggression, we will use them to good advantage. The age of their aircraft is not so important. They either have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They either have suitable delivery systems or they are acquiring them. <p> You are wrong. Both Rusia and China are working on 5th generation fighters, and both have prototypes fliying. http : **30;3229;TOOLONG -- 01. html " Fights between the F-22A and the PAK-FA will be close, high, fast and lethal. The F-22A may get ' first look ' with the APG-77, the Advanced Infra Red Search and Track( AIRST) sensor having been deleted to save money, but the PAK-FA may get ' first look ' using its advanced infrared sensor.... The outcome will be difficult to predict as it will depend a lot on the combat skills of the pilots and the capabilities of the missiles for end-game kills. There is no guarantee that the F-22 will prevail every time. " <p> God, Byron has totally gone off the deep end. In the last couple of blog posts, he insulted our Air Force pilots and lied about B-2 bombers dropping dozens of JDAMs into empty desert. I see that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is coming out and calling him on it. This guy is a nutcase who does nothing but bash air power with criticisms pulled from his rear. <p> Lets see on the evening of March 24th-25th. 2011, three B-2 's carrying 15 2000 lb weapons each released their bombs in air space outside of Libya at Libyan target. That sure looks like three dozen plus weapons to me. As far as AF BDA, it claimed no target hit, nor did the Gadhafi forces who would have benefitted from such. <p> Granted it was a needless and stupid jesters on the part of the USAF, but these acts of showmanship are rather common to them. Then their was the Bone raid that dropped 115 SDB 's and hit 100 targets, the targets have never been identified. <p> freefallingbomb, for being a self-proclaimed expert on INS and validating Byron 's assertions regarding INSs above you are rather ignorant. Not stupid, just ignorant. Since you are a private pilot, I would presume you can be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time... the time directly related to the vehicle 's speed is where they deviate from their intended destination. Also, INS 's have different drift rates based on the manufacturing technology. <p> You say that a vehicle( submarine, aircraft... whatever) must be calibrated. That is true, but if the INS drifts how do they calibrate it in flight or in the ocean? Since you are a pilot, I would presume you know a little about your aircraft systems( or you should). How do you " calibrate " your INS in flight? You do n't! At least not without another system( such as a GPS) providing a feed into it. <p> Your use of terminology is inaccurate since once the INS is calibrated, it only needs updating because the calibration occurs with respect to the INS sensing true north on the ground before you take-off. The INS is only updated after you are in flight, no INS likes straight and level flight for an extended period of time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tight "... so does a GPS. So, how does this relate to a JDAM? <p> A JDAM is an INS which travels along a relative position -- relative to the aircraft. Based on the coordinates of the aircraft, it knows the coordinates of the target. At 15,000 ft the time of flight of a JDAM is so low that it is insignificant. However, the GPS aids in this... it provides a constant input to the INS to ensure it is on the right path. So, higher altitudes are negated by GPS aiding. Additionally, the more altitude the more energy the JDAM has.( you ought to appreciate this being a pilot and having to look for diverts in an engine out condition) The JDAM glides to its target and the lower altitudes may not allow for the weapon to achieve the optimum target parameters. That said, a higher altitude JDAM profile actually negates any concerns for accuracy by 1) providing the energy and 2) providing GPS acquisition time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your INS for your piloting and also consider exploring the impact the Schuler cycle has on INSs as well. <p> Lastly, aircraft do not need men on the ground to designate targets... look into the military 's use of the term " interdiction "? That is why the coordination with the ground elements is so critical. <p> Can you imagine this? The USAF has nothing better to do than to fly three B-2 bombers( of which it only has 20, each worth over a billion dollars) on across the world from CONUS to Libya, just to waste dozens of munitions on empty desert. I too would like to see his " sources. " <p> I strongly disagreed with Byron before, but at least he was posting genuine opinions that were sane, despite being biased and occasionally inaccurate. But Byron has now lost his mind, and is repeating the same blatant lies and outrageous accusations. All backed up by alleged " sources " that he ca n't name or show anyone. <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a serious military blog and news source. They amount to slander against the American military and its servicemen. How 's about we just click " Report " from now on, and notify the blog editors whenever Byron comes out to troll like this? <p> According to this table, if gyro-compasses( " I.N.S. " = plain old gyro-compasses) deviate 650 meters after only one hour( and I know for a fact that they deviate MUCH MORE that that! The earliest trans-atlantic airliners after World War Two, the " Super-Constellations ", were always 30 km off course after a 6 hours long flight. Of course, once they arrived to the other side they had radio beacons again to find their way around), then they also drift 10,8 meters off course PER MINUTE. Simple mathematics. Now multiply this inevitable, permanent deviation with a J.D.A.M. 's( minutes of) flight time, after it 's released from a safe distance and from an effective altitude( = potential energy turned into kinetic energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely correct, when he said that I.N.S.-guided J.D.A.M.s are far too imprecise to hit any( standing, let alone moving...) vehices, or other small targets. <p> You 're just dropping half a billion $ worth of expensive, " sophisticated "( expensive does n't necessarily mean sophisticated, let alone effective) ammunitions in the SAND, like stupid! Add to that the fact that N.A.T.O.s " wise " war planners apparently ONLY work with old( = obsolete) maps, because apparently they have no communication equipment to spare for the rebels, and N.A.T.O. / Operation " Odyssey Clown " has no reconnaissance planes either( quite apparently...), then calculate your J.D.A.M.s ' resulting C.E.P.! That should also explain the incredibly suspicious lack of close-ups of destroyed targets, exactly like over Serbia 1999, too. <p> As you know, I do n't usually quip stuff like " Byron = BS ", etc.( even trolls have minimal cultural pretentions), but sincerely : What should I, as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular commentary of yours? <p> According to you, if the " solo-dancing, unconscionable Germans " did n't join just another of your Anglo Blitzkriegs, then it must be because they 're( quote) " too busy stealing gold and artworks from poor Third World peoples ". <p> Here 's MY quip : Compared to hollering U.S. American football patriots like you, even U.S. movie directors like D. W. Griffith and Samuel Fuller were vanguardistic social critics! <p> " In its most accurate mode, the JDAM system will provide a weapon circular error probable of 5 meters or less during free flight when GPS data is available. If GPS data is denied, the JDAM will achieve a 30-meter CEP or less for free flight times up to 100 seconds with a GPS quality handoff from the aircraft. " <p> Calculating free-fall speed at 15,000 feet with an initial velocity of 250 MPH, the free-fall time of a JDAM would be approximately 30 seconds. At 45,000 feet, the free-fall time would be approximately 52 seconds. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flight time from ever being measured in minutes. <p> Disregard the calculations, I forgot that the JDAM does n't truly free-falls : it glides with it 's strakes. But still, most real-world weapons-release altitudes are n't near the maximum release altitude for the JDAM. Also, because we 're dealing with opponents that do n't use highly sophisticated technologies, GPS-jamming is a non-issue. <p> Just to humor all you butternuts. It is quite obvious that none of you read any newspapers or the information you are curious about you would already have known to you. <p> All of the information on the B-2 and Bone raids was published in the LA Times, WSJ, WP, and NYT 's as well as The Air Force Times. <p> In fact most of numerical information I use for arguments comes from the above sources. If you butternuts are to lazy, to cheap to subscribe to, or dumb to read the daily news their is absolutely nothing I can do, you are operating purely on own ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue off ffb and technical information, all you are trying to do is mask the fact that you have absolutely no factual based arguments to present and have to change the subject. <p> How a JADAM II is guided to target means noting. What is important is if a weapons hits an intended target or not. The performance of US aircraft from 15,000 ft. was dismal. <p> As the military and their supporters have always done is make excuses for failures instead of owning up to them and correcting the problems which is this case appears to be a case of oversold weapon capabilities, lack of any war planning and air tasking, and under trained air crews. <p> A search on the Air Force Times and the New York Times websites brought up nothing about negative JDAM performance, but just the opposite.... articles celebrating the effectiveness of the JDAM system. The LA Times has only article regarding the JDAM, which covers the various mechanical and human errors that can interfere with JDAM performance : nothing that backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal yielded only one result that only mentioned the cost of a JDAM kit. A search on the Washington Post yielded NO results, searching for both " JDAM " and " Joint Direct Attack Munition ". <p> I 've used the following search phrase on those sites : " JDAM performance ", " JDAM error ", " JDAM miss " <p> Once again, you failed to prove anything other than your lack of ability to back up your dubious claims. <p> Have n't you heard of the " **39;3261;TOOLONG... Ergo, " excuses for failures instead of owning up to them and correcting the problems which is this case appears to be a case of oversold weapon capabilities(?)

You, know, the New-World-Order -- UN/NATO? <p> Beware the " butter-knife " brigades. are you following the rabbit trail now ALLICE? <p> There is nothing to respond to. All I see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any Middle School playground. <p> Nobody is making an argument to support any idea and you are doing is bullying and since I 've already kicked you collective sixes, I have nothing more to say. Right now I have to get ready a Daily Teaspoon column. <p> It is the nonsense that is above, is why dod buzz is no longer read by the people that are making decisions, you guys with your silly right wing postings killed the site. <p> You make a dubious statement about the ineffectiveness of JDAM thus the ineffectiveness of the F-22. We challenged your statement and called for you to prove your claims. You state that your claims are based off of articles that are readily available online, yet still did not cite any publications. When pressed further you spout off random publications without directly citing any specific articles. I then took the time to search those publications you cited and found nothing to back up your original statement. <p> Now you come back and pout that we 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter-arguments to your original statement. But the discussion got stalled when you failed to properly address our counter-arguments and requests for citations, instead attempting to divert the discussion away from your original points. Now you 're including baseless right-wing bashing comments( which by the way I 'm an independent), which is yet another failure on your part for this discussion... as comments of that nature easily devolves discussions into back-and-forth name-calling. <p> If you honestly wanted a real discussion, you 'd have better served yourself with preparing some readily available citations to go directly with your posting and leave out the left-wing/right-wing sentiments. Otherwise, I 'd venture to guess that you 're really just using lengthy fluff-filled posts to give the appearance that you actually have some sort of technical expertise, in an attempt to persuade the ignorant masses into following your own personal agendas. Your posting behavior on this site is indicative of this. <p> MOVE some **25;3343;TOOLONG from BAGDAD to ABADAN and AHWAZ again SSSSSSSecretly then you can back up SHIRAZ FORRRRR better control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uppppppppp <p> THE next back up can be moved through BAKKU but is not easy to be tusted are lots of eyesssss WAtching if you get a chance entere to makkoo the old border in between remmmmmemmmber the old EYESSSSSSS are stillll there the local can lead you to TABRIZ but you have to be carefullllll tabriz is half and half you got to be with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p> 2) "... the JDAM will achieve a 30-meter CEP or less for free flight times up to 100 seconds with a GPS quality handoff from the aircraft.

What tank or bunker wall on Earth wo n't resist a 2.000 pounds( 910 kg) heavy J.D.A.M. from that far way? Will you even be able to hit a runway with only one single G.P.S.-less( or jammed) J.D.A.M.? If not : Why not resort to good, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) <p> The rest of your post, whether a smart bomb falls free( vertically) or whether it has a gliding angle( thanks to airplane speed and / or to its own wings and / or to its own propulsion) is irrelevant to the precisions of various guidance systems. <p> The current accumulated costs of the Libyan air war for the US is $608 million dollar and the DoD estimated cost per month of standing by is $40 million a month. <p> I got an OK to say that the B-2 and Bone raids carried out on Libya were done from 40,000 ft. I was offered no corrections on my statements on BDA. <p> To ffb. Regardless of your political feelings on the current French Government, they are doing a great job and have moved operations into West Africa where the US is afraid to thread. From the reluctance I 'm hearing from sources, I would n't be surprise that Syria will become a French show. <p> The concern with in the US military about the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had previously been told. The accuracy issue and the general inability of our so-called very expensive( JADAM II kit for a 500 lb. bomb is said to cost $50,000.00 for the kit alone, or as my source said thats more then the average wages of three Wal-Mart employees)) smart weapons to find/hit and destroy is bothering a lot of members of congress. <p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia In the military science of ballistics, circular error probable( CEP)( also circular error probability or circle of equal probability1) is an intuitive measure of a weapon system 's accuracy. It is defined as the radius of a circle, centered about the mean, whose boundary is expected to include 50% of the population within it. 2 The original concept of CEP was based on a circular bivariate normal distribution( CBN) with CEP as a parameter of the CBN just as? and? are parameters of the normal distribution. Munitions with this distribution behavior tend to cluster around the aim point, with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very few at long distance. That is, if CEP is n meters, 50% of rounds land within n meters of the target, 43% between n and 2n, and 7 % between 2n and 3n meters, and the proportion of rounds that land farther than three times the CEP from the target is less than 0.2%. This distribution behavior is often not met. Precision-guided munitions generally have more " close misses " and so are not normally distributed. Munitions may also have larger standard deviation of range errors than the standard deviation of azimuth( deflection) errors, resulting in an elliptical confidence region. Munition samples may not be exactly on target, that is, the mean vector will not be( 0,0). This is referred to as bias. To apply the CEP concept in these conditions, we can define CEP as the square root of the mean square error( MSE). The MSE will be the sum of the variance of the range error plus the variance of the azimuth error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error plus the square of the bias. Thus the MSE results from pooling all these sources of error, geometrically corresponding to radius of a circle within which 50% of rounds will land. editConversion between CEP, RMS, 2DRMS, and R95 <p> While 50% is a very common definition for CEP, the circle dimension can be defined for percentages. Approximate formulas are available to convert the distributions along the two axes into the equivalent circle radius for the specified percentage. 34 Accuracy MeasureProbability( %) Root mean square( RMS) 63 to 68 Circular error probability( CEP) 50 Twice the distance root mean square( 2DRMS) 95 to 98 95% radius( R95) 95
