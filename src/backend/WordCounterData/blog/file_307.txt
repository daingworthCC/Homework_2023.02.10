5138941 <p> City of Light, City of Magic : As goes Greater Cleveland, so goes the nation <p> Before we talk about Ohio, my home state where I was born and raised, I want to tell you about something unexpected that happened for Justin and me in the last few weeks that I hope you get to experience for yourself on a bigger scale in the next few months : the calm and serenity of terrible people moving out of your lives for good. <p> I 've had this apartment for a few years now and only had great neighbors in the building until the people downstairs moved in last October. Justin and I are on the third floor of an old Victorian here in Boystown that at one time was probably a well-to-do family 's home( carved up in later years to make four apartments ; one each on the garden level and then first, second, and third floors... our place, I think, was once an attic). I 'll call the people who lived below us for the past year Seamus and Sally, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this planet. <p> It started immediately with these people, with loud pounding and yelling every time Justin and I walked up the steps to our place ; because of the way the building was designed, the stairs to our apartment actually ascend that flight directly over Seamus and Sally 's bedroom( which is not our fault... and we need to walk up the stairs to get home as neither of us are vampires who can fly or turn to smoke to get home). This immediately freaked Justin out, because he 's the kind of guy who 's devastated for days if he accidentally steps on a ladybug or smashes a few flowers because he 's not paying attention to where he 's walking. One day I caught Justin slowly walking a step at a time, pausing with each step, taking ten minutes to get up the stairs because he did n't want to make any noise and upset the neighbors. <p> Oh, I put an end to that lickety split because we pay good money to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our apartment like normal people... without the neighbors below banging on the walls and screaming for us to be quiet while we 're just walking up stairs for a minute a few times each day. It 's just not appropriate for the new neighbors to pound and scream and attempt to bully Justin into walking up the stairs like he 's an octogenarian with hip problems because they 've scared him into being a mouse in his own house. So, I contacted the landlord and asked him it Seamus and Sally had been given a tour of the apartment before they rented it and if they happened to notice the fact that, yes, the stairs leading to the apartment above went right over the bedroom in the apartment below. If they wanted to live there, they needed to realize that people would be coming and going like normal regardless of their presence downstairs. <p> The landlord said he would talk to them and get the banging to stop, and it eventually did. But then Seamus was mad about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on my interactions with the two of them, I 'm convinced everything these people did to us for the last year was 100% Seamus ' idea, because Sally was at least polite( she even invited everyone in the building to a Halloween party when they first moved in, before they started the banging and weirdness). To be honest, I think Seamus had a problem with Justin and me being gay and living above them... which is foolish when you think about it because Seamus and Sally chose to live in BOYSTOWN. Apparently, the same kind of problem is happening in the Castro district of San Francisco, too, where straight couples have been moving into the gentrified areas that have been gay ghettos for decades... and then the straight people have a problem with the gay bars, businesses, and people who were in the neighborhood before them. <p> Things I 'd order from Amazon.com would go missing, despite that never happening ever before ; our building has no doorman but there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we told the landlord to stop Seamus ' banging my books would go missing from the vestibule instead of being there for me when I got home each day( the way they had been waiting for several years before Seamus and Sally moved in). " Someone " started leaving garbage and junk mail by our steps, when that never happened before the people downstairs moved in. All those flyers, takeout menus, local newspaper coupons, etc. that used to pile up in the vestibule were mysteriously being carried over to the steps to our place and dumped on the floor there... making us have to remove those things every day, for no good reason. <p> And then the weird notes started appearing on Justin 's car. Nasty, vulgar notes that would criticize Justin 's parking... always along the lines of " Hey, faggot... try not leaving so much space between you and the car in front so other people can park you a**h***!!!! ". Which is ridiculous because cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justin does n't drive his car every day. It might be a week between drives anywhere... and in that time several cars in front or behind him could move, with lots of people parking and repacking around Justin. If the note-writer did n't like the space around Justin 's car, then he should really be blaming the people who parked around Justin... not Justin or his car that has n't moved in a week. <p> Justin was afraid I could n't prove it was Seamus leaving the notes on the car but I waited until the notes got REALLY vulgar and nasty, with lots of " faggot this " and " faggot that " in them and then I showed Justin how perfectly the notes compared to the Halloween party invitation that Sally had printed out and slipped under all the doors last October. The notes and that invitation were printed on the same printer using the same paper, with similar punctuation and repeated use of(!!!) to end sentences. There was also a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages as it pushed the paper out after printing. I 'm not a forensic expert, but it sure looked like whoever sent the Halloween invitation was also leaving the nasty notes on Justin 's car. <p> So, I looked up Chicago 's discrimination statutes on this sort of thing and typed up a letter to our landlord noting that what was being left on Justin 's car clearly could be a matter for the police or the City if we needed to take things to the next level to get this to stop. I included the Halloween note comparison to those notes and a copy of the contemporary log I 'd maintained of all the little nasty things these people kept doing to Justin and me and formally asked the landlord to put a stop to all the things that have been mysteriously happening since Seamus and Sally moved in downstairs... and let him know that if it did n't stop we 'd be forced to go to the City for help next. <p> We never heard anything else from the landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to me, other than a few emails here and there where he would use some excuse to tell us about something related to the building where he 'd always slip in an " I just want to let you know what good tenants you are and how much we enjoy having you in the building " line to us. We really like our landlord and really love the building... but were hoping Seamus and Sally were just a temporary burden in our lives. <p> When they moved out without fanfare earlier this month it was a night and day change in energy at home for us. Justin and I had always been on edge wondering what Seamus would do next. Walking up the stairs, Justin forever had a panicked look on his face, hoping he would n't make enough noise to prompt a return to the banging. There are no more nasty, homophobic notes being left on Justin 's car criticizing him. The piles of junk that Seamus was clearly throwing on our stairs remain in the waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk alway stayed before Seamus and Sally lived in the building. With them gone for several weeks now, things are back to normal here, how they were before these two dreadful people became a daily problem for us. <p> Sitting here, I realize this is the sort of relief we 're all going to feel once the Obamas move from the White House to that estate in Hawaii they 're headed towards to start his post-presidential life. As soon as they step onto the 747 that 's going to carry them from DC to Honolulu next January, it will feel even better than Seamus and Sally packing up their Toyota and heading to Evanston or wherever. I hope in his post-presidency we see as little of Barack and Michelle as Justin and I are seeing of Seamus and Sally these days. <p> I 'm amazed, really, just how much better it is with those terrible neighbors gone. They caused a lot of tension between Justin and me because his natural response to bullies is to try to augment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains as quiet as possible to not upset them. My response to guys like Seamus is to document the bad things they do and ultimately filed charges against them if other formal complaints do n't work to end the bad behavior. So, there was a daily clash between the two of us whenever Seamus would get up to his tricks... and all that energy wasted on this is now going to more positive things. We 're both so much happier now that the terrible neighbors are gone. <p> I have a feeling you 're going to feel the same way when the Obamas are our of our collective lives for good, too. <p> Probably by spring of 2013 the elation of them being out of the White House will subside a little and we 'll all be able to look back on the nasty things the two of them did for four years and appreciate how lucky we are that they did n't have two terms to double this grief. Someday, we might even see a silver lining in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before another Democrat is in the White House... and when that happens it will be people more like the Clintons, in the way the Clintons were the first Democrats allowed back into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since the dreadful Carters. So, we 'll probably have a nice stretch of 12 or 16( or even 20) years without any Democrats in the White House... and a term or so after that of people who deliberately try to be nothing like the Obamas in the way the Clintons purposefully were nothing at all like the Carters. For a lot of us, this means that Barack and Michelle will really be the absolute most terrible people we 'll ever have to deal with in " the people 's house ". <p> And soon they will be Honolulu 's problem, so living in Chicago not only will Justin and me be rid of Seamus and Sally but we wo n't have Barack and Michelle as our " neighbors " in Hyde Park, either. <p> I ca n't even begin to express how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Doom Antidote today( not that anyone with any sense to them should be buying any of the Ministry of Truth 's propaganda and Doom Reports today, since it should be clear to you that Mitt Romney is going to win... with the only question remaining just HOW BIG that win will be) I wanted to talk a little about Ohio, the state I lived in before I moved first to Pennsylvania and then Chicago for work. I will always love Ohio, especially the Cleveland area I grew up in, but I left because Democrats drove all the jobs out of the city( and state). If I wanted any sort of future at all, I knew I had to resettle elsewhere... or just resign myself to living a meager life with what little opportunity remained in a place driven into the ground by the labor unions and Democrat politicians. <p> I actually keep in touch with a lot of friends from high school via Facebook and other avenues and I want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio) in particular since the scoop I 'm getting from them on the ground is fascinating. <p> While I have not lived in Cleveland in about 8 years now, I still think I know the basic nature of the people there. Greater Cleveland encompasses all of Cuyahoga County the way that Chicagoland takes up all of Cook County here in Illinois. Though Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are not one in the same, technically, all the suburbs that surround Cleveland and the city itself are the entirety of Cuyahoga County. " Cuyahoga ", for those curious, refers to the crooked, serpentine river that winds through the city of Cleveland ; yes, this is the river that caught fire in the 70s and the one that rats could run across by leaping from one bit of floating garbage to the next for many years. <p> I 've always been surprised when people say that Chicago is the most segregated city in the country because it 's actually a lot like Cleveland, where I grew up. In Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid places like Wrigleyville, the yuppies on the Gold Coast, all the cops and firemen and union guys in Bridgeport, the young families in Lincoln Park, the Hispanics in Pilsen, the lefty elitists in Hyde Park, and the blacks in the Southside. Because Chicago is so big, each neighborhood feels like its own mini-city within the larger City of Chicago. <p> With Cleveland being so much smaller, the suburbs of Chicago form something similar to the neighborhoods I described above. The gays are in Lakewood. The lefty elitists are in Shaker Heights or Chagrin Falls. Blacks are in Cleveland itself and also East Cleveland. The cops and firefighters and union guys are in Euclid. Then there 's a place called Parma( and the nicer Parma Heights) that always brings a smile to my face because there 's no real equivalent to it here in Chicago ; the people of Parma are mostly descendants of Polish people who came to America around WWII or so, and who have built a unique community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around in black socks with sandals, and a strong desire to prove how smart they are by always voting for who they think is going to win the national election. When I talk about Clevelanders( and people in Ohio in general) wanting to feel like winners by backing the candidate they believe is going to triumph in the end, a lot of that drive originates with Parma residents( and similar people in Brook Park, Brunswick, Independence, North Royalton, etc.). <p> Ohio 's marketed as " the heart of it all " by the convention and tourism board but it 's really more the " bellwether state " because I think Ohioans -- and the people of Cleveland in particular -- are a natural indicator of what 's going to happen in an election on the whole. Despite a habit of repeatedly sending Democrats to high office, Clevelanders are n't lockstep Democrat voters the way people in Chicago or New York or Philadelphia are. I think this is because the suburbs of Cleveland have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fun of Parma for the flamingos and the socks but the people who live there are nice, hardworking, and love America. That 's really how most of the suburbs of Cleveland are... so Cleveland itself may have had Democrat mayors exclusively since the 1980s but none of these people have been cuckoo birds or or Leftist kings( like a Rahm Emanuel is, here in Chicago) ; I think the good people in Parma and the other suburbs keep that from happening because the culture in Cleveland is not one that allows people to openly embrace the Left. <p> Cleveland is a place where not much good ever seems to happen and people tend to hitch their star to one crazy scheme after another. I 've written about this before on this site many times in the past, but through the years Clevelanders have hope their salvation would be a new baseball stadium... until that did n't work and they decided it would be a new basketball arena that would save the city. They tried that, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shiny new mall downtown. Or maybe a convention center. Or a casino. Or a new aquarium. It 's a lot like The Simpsons episode where a guy comes to town and tells everyone that the answer to their prayers is in fact a MONORAIL. In all seriousness, as someone who was born and raised in Cleveland, I can honestly say I am STUNNED that Cleveland has actually never built a monorail as the latest in a long line of " answers to our prayers ". It 's not that the people of Cleveland are gullible... it 's just that they are open to just about anything that 's presented to them that makes them think things could get better if they give this new thing a shot. When it does n't work, there 's no grumping or recrimination... they just move onto the next idea forever optimistic that SOMETHING, one day, will save the city of light, city of magic that is my hometown. <p> Please keep this all in mind when thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barack Obama 's hopeychange express was the monorail Clevelanders believed would save the day back in 2008. They 've now seen Obama has failed, just as the endless stream of big promises made to Cleveland about one fanciful thing or the other over the years have failed. And Clevelanders are ready for the next thing presented to them as a solution to their ills... and that is Romney/Ryan and America 's Comeback Team. <p> While it 's true that there are usually enough black and union voters in Cleveland to run up solid margins or Democrats in the state of Ohio, the suburbs around Cleveland that impact Cuyahoga County as a whole will not be voting for Obama this year. Democrats will not win Parma, and Parma is the key to Cleveland. The people of Parma gave Obama a chance last time and many probably enjoyed helping the first black president " make history ". But they 're over that and looking to the future now and they want the next plan to succeed... the plan pushed by Romney/Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of my former classmates still live in the area or in other Cleveland suburbs. Reports keep coming in that these people, and their friends and neighbors and coworkers, are voting for Romney/Ryan. They are not sitting home, and they will not vote for Obama again. Many of them did that in 2008 and have decided " it 's time to give someone else a chance because Obama did n't work out the way we wanted ". <p> If I can communicate anything about Ohio to you it would be this attitude : you might not see Ohioans foaming at the mouth angry about Obama, but that 's just not their style. Ohioans are not complainers and are typically not as vocal or in-your-face as, say, Chicagoans. I am anomalous for a Clevelander in that I put my opinions out there in a public way. Most people back home are more reserved and not so open with what they are thinking or feeling. They just get up, get dressed, go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their families. Political involvement is the last thing on their minds. But they will vote... and those votes will go to Mitt Romney this time. <p> Either Obama loses Cuyahoga County outright( which could happen, because blacks in Cleveland are upset with Democrats over abortion and gay marriage and will be sitting home on Election Day in higher numbers than ever) or it 's such an anemic win that he does n't get the numbers he needs out of Greater Cleveland to carry the state. <p> From what I am hearing, people on the ground in Ohio 's other main cities of Toledo, Akron/Canton, Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati believe black turnout there will be incredibly low as well... and that the suburbs around those urban centers will solidly go for Romney. <p> This means Obama is one and done... and out of our lives in January of next year. <p> I do n't think any of this sentiment registers in polls or is being factored by the analysts in the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their part, or they just look down on the people in places like Parma, Ohio and do n't stop to think about what these folks will really be doing on Election Day. I also do n't think Minitru wants to admit that Americans genuinely wanted to elect a black president in 2008 and they really wanted the man to succeed... but when they saw he failed and could n't deliver they knew they needed to move on to someone who could keep his promises. So they are firing Obama and replacing him with Romney but they 're not doing it with any hard feelings. <p> According to my Ohio contacts, people just want the Election to be over... for the Obama years to become part of the past and history... and for the future to start fresh with Romney in just a few months. <p> Are you seeing or hearing anything like this where you live? <p> Do you have a ground report that 's similar about your home town? <p> This is an open thread, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help people understand where this election is headed or give a fuller picture of the race than what Minitru is painting. <p> Gay conservative political analyst, essayist, author and radio and TV commentator on politics, pop culture, LGBTQ issues, and current events. To email Kevin directly with a comment or complaint about this or any article, do so at : HillBuzz@gmail.com <h> 100 Comments <p> Let 's talk Parma shall we. Yesterday 's Obama rally opened with 39 minutes of Bruce Springstein followed up by Bill Clinton. Results were a crowd of just under 3,000. The last Romney appearance in Ohio( without a free concert included) was attended by over 10,000. <p> If they have to include free Springstein and can only pull in 3,000 people to a rally they are for all practical purposes dead. <p> Have a certain number of " tickets " reserved for people... and when that number is reached, say it 's sold out. <p> The venue could have room for as many as 4,000 people... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 tickets you had then you do n't have to tell the press about the other 2,000 spaces you had open for the general public. <p> All events have VIP seating, donor seating, supporter seating, and then the general admission. <p> Gen Admission is not ticketed. <p> Saying " sold out " means that you just had people sign up for all the slots you claimed were available... but does not mean the place was filled. <p> Only 2,000 in Green Bay? What a joke! With the UW campus, St. Norbert 's, and the the four other schools in the area there are about 22,000 students add to that the hundreds of leftist teachers and you have an abject failure! A good number would have been more like 12,000. <p> Any presidential candidate has a retinue of about 70 or 80, add to that the press and local party operatives. So out of the 1.000 maybe 700 or so were actual voters. That 's like a depressing waste of time. <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the lie alive. Brilliant strategy as long as the press co-operates. Of course when Obama goes to bed at night his fluffy pillow gets all wet with tears because he knows he is no longer the one. <p> Right on Kevin! I 'm in SW Cleveland in a small rural community with great school system. I see equal numbers of Romney /Obama signs always near each other. Maybe more Romney... <p> Cleveland city schools just received horrible ratings and they are saying state will have to take over. Do n't forget former county commissioner Jimmy Dimorra and Auditor Frank Russo scandal and sentencing! We know the Dems are crooks here! <p> but then you have the teachers, their unions, police and firefighters that hang on and will refuse to vote Repub in fear they will lose benefits. In 2011, the state voted against Kasich 's union reforms while voting against the health care mandate so it shows Ohioans are paying attention to the issues. The unions did a good job scaring people that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan.... Yet Ohioans did n't have a problem voting against Obamacare. One had to read the questions carefully on the ballot.... <p> Jimmy Dimorra used to eat there all the time. I dated a guy who was a waiter there and he 'd sometimes tell me when he was there and I 'd then come in for a meal and would of course get to sit at the table next to Dimorra. And I would listen in. I was always trying go get scoop from him or try to catch him talking about something illegal. He was a big fat pig who 'd just DEVOUR food... giant plates of seafood appetizers... massive cuts of meat... potatoes, potatoes, potatoes... wine like it poured from faucets. I have never seen a human eat like this. <p> Of course, taxpayers paid the bills for all that. <p> I never got anything interesting but it was fun always trying. <p> I do that here in Chicago still... with friends in the service industry tipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant. <p> A few days ago, a high school classmate of my husband 's posted on facebook about her 12 year old daughter coming upstairs shaking her head after watching the second presidential debate. " I ca n't believe that man has been our president for the last four years, " the girl said. " Why do you say that? " asked the mom. " Because he did n't answer any of those people 's questions. He went on and on about other things, but did n't actually answer any of their questions. " <p> Take heart -- if a 12-year-old can see it, maybe enough " grownups " can too! <p> Kevin, thanks as always for your daily doom antidote -- I read every day! I do think we will all feel so much better with the Obamas gone, like you feel without the bad neighbors. I know it will be a source of stress off my shoulders for sure( though congressional Democrats will do their best to make up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school assignment was to watch the debate. My daughter noticed that right away too. ' He did not answer the question! ' Many of her friends were tweeting about the debate. In her school, Obama is not the messiah. The majority of the parents do not like Obama. But what liked about the whole thing was how many were tweeting about it and were not happy with Obama. Of course the kids who go to the public arts school did pull the race card out when on of my daughter 's school mates commented something true about Obama supporters that was really funny. <p> I 've lived in Ohio for 27 years and you can just feel and see the difference from 4 years ago. My hubby works at a Catholic HS in a predominately black neighborhood in Columbus and the yard signs are few and far between this time around for Obama. There are Romney signs in this same area and even a Black guy driving around the area in his pickup with a huge sign telling people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank the koolaid last time and are all voting Romney this time. He 'll win. <p> Hey Kevin- I am just a few years older than you and grew up in Avon Lake, on the West side. When you were describing Parma, I could n't help but think of the old Uncle Vic show on the radio late at night, and his parody of Prince 's Erotic City, called Erotic Suburb : Pink flamigoes on the lawn, Bowling shirts and white socks on, Erotic Suburb Wash the car And Mow the Lawn Erotic Suburb <p> Excellent analysis Kevin. These people are always looking for the next savior thing which is also called shiny object syndrome. I read another good analysis of Ohio on the web by a fellow working with pollsters. The northern and more industrial areas like Cleveland, Akron, etc are getting older and losing population. This is probably older union people who worked for companies up there when business was better( 1960s to 1970s). These people have been dying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, have moved away because there are no jobs. <p> This fellow also said that the population growth in OH has been in the more conservative southern parts of OH. <p> I agree with you that the enthusiasm is not there for Obama. I also think he is going through the motion now and does not really want to win. It appears that the golf bug has bitten him. Golf can be as addictive as drugs. I am not kidding. If he has a coke and golf habit then why would he want to stay in the White House. <p> My guess is playing golf each day in Hawaii is looking pretty attractive. I also think he and almost everyone else underestimated Romney. Romney has been very successful because he has incredible discipline. This led to a good education, career and the ability to stay very very focused. Obama has no discipline except his " wife " and Jarrett. Romney is just relentless. <p> Finally, Romney has one people over as being professional, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Hut soon like Seamus and his wife left. <p> This is something of a preview ground report, because there is going to be a huge Victory Florida rally tonight at the Daytona Beach Bandshell, on the beach, here in East Central Florida at the east end of the " I-4 Corridor ". BOTH Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are going to be there together, along with the " GOP Team "( whoever that turns out to be : Rick Scott? Jeb Bush? Pam Bondi( likely), Marco Rubio( I hope)...). This is also coinciding with the height of " Biketoberfest " which is a Harley and other biker event. And the R/R Rally is going to be right there with all the bikers. I 'm told they wanted it that way. <p> The newspaper says they expect 10,000 ; I 'm going to attempt to go, but it 's going to be a crazy crowd time for this not so big beach city. I see 10:1 Romney signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " FOR SALE / IF OBAMA WINS ". <p> It has the feel of real victory ; I certainly hope so, if I have anything to report it will probably be tomorrow! <p> Kevin, I am glad that you and Justin are free of horrific neighbors, now. They are miserable and will make misery wherever they go. When the Obamas vacate the White House, we will all be just as jubilant. As US citizens, we are the landlords of the " people 's house " and undesirable tenants need to be evicted. I am so angry that that man can call the murder of four American citizens " not optimal and a bump in the road " and tried to blame the 9/11 terror attacks on an obscure movie that no muslim had ever heard of when all along he and those standing with him knew who was responsible and they perpetuated his lies. But when it came to the anti muslim movie Obama was outraged and called it disgusting and inhuman and monstrous and he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the murder and unspeakable TORTURE of Americans begging for security is a smallish thing but free speech against the brotherhood of muslim is an abomination. He should be tried for treason and those of his ilk. Kevin, you say his drug use, lies, machinations and Allinsky dreams will all be exposed mainstream, in time. Can not wait. Thanks again, for all you do. <p> You are so right! Obama is more outraged at that stupid video than he is at our citizens being murdered overseas! He really thinks America and American citizens are the problem in this world. I 'm continuing to pray and fast to save this country from Obama and those of his ilk who seek to destroy us all. <p> Happy for you now. We too have " unloaded " very toxic people in our lives. We did the work of separation, but it was worth it. And yes, it is like a huge weight lifted away. It does take a little bit of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does. <p> It is work to not go back there in my head, but also easier over time. It lasted so many many years that this is expected. <p> The rending of the garments by the Commie Kooks when Romney wins will be worth it in and of itself. The derangement is such that they have taken to denying polls that show Romney is ahead. They must spend all of their time watching( C) See( N) othing but( N) onsense or BSNBC, convinced they are unbiased. <p> I have tested this by commenting at such paragons of " tolerance " as Mother Jones or Alternet. A nugget of truth posted there is treated like a vampire when he has to confront a cross. <p> It would be nice to not be ashamed of the occupant of the White House and what he has done domestically and worldwide. <p> President BEBO( Blame Everybody But Obama) will be getting the heave ho on November 6. However, do not count him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that nickname. If you thought his blaming America and apologizing all over the world was bad when he was President, we ai n't seen nothin ' yet! <p> Ever notice that former democrat president never retire with grace and dignity unlike their Republican counterparts? Talking to you Carter, Clinton and BEBO. <p> I ca n't believe kids this stupid are college students. I think if I were doing the interviews I would ask them WHY they are voting for Obama, and what they are majoring in. I think you could work that into the interview without seeming confrontational. I also think I would ask them if they know who Kim Kardashian is when they admit that have no idea who Ambassador Chris Stevens is or what happened in Benghazi. I will guarantee you, every single one of them knows who Kim Kardashian is. <p> I would also like to see juxtaposed net to this video, interviews with the students at Hillsdale College. I bet every single one of them knows who Ambassador Stevens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Great analysis where you go behind the polling statistics to give a true picture of community mindsets. <p> I live in a small east coast city, one of the murder capitals. The kind of place where people have easy friendships across racial or cultural lines based on common interests but there is a lot of racist violence if you are a stranger to them. The city has crumbling infrastructure, failed police force, worst schools in the state, falling population. It 's majority black, minority Hispanic, white and Asian in the single digits. During elections, things can heat up and higher ups tend to stoke jealousies between groups, who never know that the people pretending to be enemies work together just fine on their own level. I know this from experience running for local office years ago and generally being around the fringes. At one time five people were running for mayor in a non-partisan elections and every one of them was a good friend of mine. <p> When people were remarking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already knew that term. Around here you would read reporting of certain black leaders mocking people as white hispanics and saying that they all ought to be together against the white people. I knew these people personally and in private life, when there was no election to determine who got a bigger sayso, they were friendly, pleasant, caring people. There 's a lot of theatrics that goes on around elections. For the most part, candidates are Democrats. They go to pains to point out that they are the " real " or " true " Democrats unlike all their opponents. I only found out by accidental slip of the tongue that one political friend of mine was a Republican. Some years ago it was better to hush that up, like a family scandal. <p> Lovely senior couple live around the corner from me. He 's retired and somewhat active in community groups. They 're tall, handsome, genteel. Their very modest house, as most are here, is immaculately kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual in this neighborhood, immaculate. It sprouted an Obama sign last time. At first I was a little surprised but I think it must have been more for historic reasons. <p> I have n't seen any lawn or window signs or anything on cars. I check their lawn. Tell myself it 's early yet. It is n't early any more. No big sign on the lawn. It might be because a lot of people who move into this neighborhood go back to their old neighborhoods on Sundays. This couple does. So I 'm wondering if it has to do with how their congregation might feel about the progressive social issues. <p> It just feels like there 's no election in the offing. Nobody 's talking about it. No theatrics. Last time the mayor had a huge rally for the gubernatorial candidate and Obama. I was invited but did not go. It was televised. I no longer remember whether Obama was actually there or on jumbotron. This year I have n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel it 's guaranteed he would win this state but what about some kind of major fundraisers? Maybe I 'm just too far out of the loop any more but I do n't hear a thing about any election. <p> But, no, I 'm not brave enough to put a Romney/Ryan sign on my house. My street is lots better than it used to be since the flagrant drug set across the street moved out but people still do drive through aiming to buy drugs on the block from those that are left.. <p> On the other hand, my grown son goes to school and works for the university at the other end of town. He reads Facebook and is on Twitter and all his information is about how terrible Romney is doing, people jeering at him, etc. In his mind, these young people are " everybody. " I am always gaping at him when he tells me their version of things. I do notice, though, that none of his information is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is. It leads me to think that most of their interest is along the lines of what Rick Perry called Hot Air : hot gas. <p> Four years ago, there were teachers my son had who were all Obama all the time. I 'm not hearing anything similar this year. <p> Kevin, talk me down from the windowsill. I just saw unskewedpolls.com and they have a big swing since yesterday for Obummer. What 's up with that? If I got all freaked out with some of the polls I always checked theirs to calm down and today that poll freaked me out! Between you and them is what 's keeping me focused and calm <p> I love you, girl, because we 're friends like that but you 're too old and smart to get freaked out or climb onto windowsills. And I know you are not an attention seeker who just wants to come online to tell others who freaked out she is. Sometimes in life you need to fix yourself a beverage of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pushups or sit-ups so the adrenaline and endorphins can refocus you. <p> Polls are bunk, Sandy. Especially this year. Instead of looking at polls you should be taking a bigger picture look at the race and seeing that there is no positive energy in the Obama campaign. There is no compelling reason to vote for the man. Jill Biden is being sent to Minnesota to campaign there. Democrats are having to campaign in Oregon, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The firewall has moved back to the point where it 's possible for Democrats to lose NEW JERSEY this year. That could really happen. <p> If you 're letting yourself be freaked out then you need to ask yourself if this is how you want to live your life. But I think you are better than this. I think you can control your freak outs and after Romney wins I hope you see that you were freaked out for no reason... and that being freaked out is a bad thing. <p> Be calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And know that polls are easily manipulated to help Democrats. I still do n't know who is even behind Unskewedpolls.com. I think it 's a good site to see that there really is bias and sampling machinations put into this... but I do n't know if that site has an agenda or not. <p> Will do! I am pretty much always checking those two sites anyway. I probably should cool it for awhile anyway. I am checking too many sites but your advice is so noted. Thanks again. I guess I am like so many people... just wanting this thing over already!!!! <p> Even without knowing anything else, the lost Evangelical Vote and the black vote that will stay home is enough to drop Obama from 52% to below 50% in and of itself. <p> Then add in Romney is picking up more than a few states that Bush won and McCain lost. <p> Then remember this about polls. Obama pulled out of North Carolina, The " polls " show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still oversampling Dems and Obama knows it. All things being equal it seems safe to deduct 5% from Obama from nearly every poll. <p> Finally we have Hillary cooperating with the Libyan Investigation that has already proven the lack of security was the fault of inaction by the White House. Bill has said that Obama has n't made anything better in reference to the last debate. They have n't forgotten being called " racists " in 2008 and it is payback time. <p> Add all of this up and the only reason it could be remotely close is the demographics of the Electoral College. Anyway we will soon party like its 2004. <p> Let 's look at it this way. Is there anyone who voted for McCain last time that will vote Obama this time? Zero. Ai n't happening. Democrats will not have the turnout as in 2008. Those who want to save this country will walk barefoot through broken glass to remove him. Obama did not win by a land slide. There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 in the last 3 weeks. I see Romney stickers. Comments sections that were filled with Obama love barely have enough comments to notice anymore. <p> Obama will get votes of hard core lefties. But the trend followers... will they show up to vote or will they watch the Kardashians.... especially when the tee vee tells them Obama has it. <p> I used to be worried. Not anymore. I did have a minute of panic about that Nate Silver prediction, but then found out he only predicted the last two elections cycles... but who could n't. It was Obvious. Do not worry. Obama lost his coolness. The media just are ready for his time to be up. <p> He wins Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. <p> I think it 's a coin toss if he 'd take Pennsylvania. If he would, that means he 'd also take Michigan and maybe even Oregon and New Jersey. It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would mean the democrats have no firewall left... just destruction. <p> Obama 's last stand is in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. He 's already lost the race in my opinion but it 's now a matter of seeing how big the loss will be. <p> Very happy to hear that your downstairs neighbours are living somewhere else.( Clearly, someone who behaves that way has a lot of problems, but that does n't make your life any less miserable.) <p> As for the ground : um, I 'm in Massachusetts -- blue, blue Massachusetts -- and I talked to a lifelong Democrat today who is voting for Romney. If you 've lost Massachusetts Democrats, you 've lost everyone to the right of Elizabeth Warren, and you 're going to lose the election. <p> Can not even IMAGINE what Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Virginia, Missouri, and Colorado are going to be like if Massachusetts Democrats are n't supporting Obama. <p> CT, too, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and both houses of the legislature are controlled by Dems. But, CT went for Reagan. CT citizens are hurting. People are n't seeing pay raises to compensate for the price of food, gas and other goods. <p> I have seen only a handful of O signs around. I live in the country and work in a small city. I think the only reason I 'm not seeing more Romney signs is because I do n't think they stand out very well. They do n't catch one 's eye, especially amidst all the local candidates ' signs. And I was told by a member of the Republican Town Committee that if you wanted a Romney sign, you had to purchase it. Boy, was that a dumb idea. <p> But, I am hopeful that CT voters have woken up and will be voting for Romney. I mostly base this on comments from clients. I 've been discreetly trying to poll them. Many of them are senior citizens. Some of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so again. Even my boss, who told me in 08 to get ready for " President Obama " many months ago said, " Get ready to say President Romney. " <p> A lot of people this side of the pond are going to be shocked at Bathhouse Barry 's... sorry... Obama 's defeat. If even half of what you 're saying about the feeling of betrayal amongst black voters in his Chicago heartland is true, he is going to suffer an ignominious and deservedly humiliating downfall. <p> That blessed feeling of relief that you describe is exactly how I felt when I read your post about Mrs.Robinson 's daughter and family looking for a home NOW in Hawaii. I had no idea how negatively this couple have affected me until I felt that relief.Thank you! God bless your work on this site. <p> Your observations are spot on about the " Monorail " or " Next big thing that will Save Our City " mindset. Cleveland is far from alone in this type of thinking, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining get sold a bill of sale for : <p> Aquariums, stadiums, waterparks, street scape improvements, " historic " districts that will become shopping and entertainment districts, skateparks, dogparks, state of the art schools that will win back the middle class( ask Kansas City how well that worked). Libraries, green space. <p> The residents are convinced that their failing downtown wasteland will be renovated into the saving grace that will make cities such as Cleveland, Atlanta, Memphis, Detroit safe and desirable places. What 's built works for 2-3 years, then the city is stuck with the tab for something that has quit paying it 's own way. Ask Atlanta residents how many times they 've been stuck with the tab for The Underground? Or how well Renaissance has turned around Detroit. Or how the World 's Fair has helped Knoxville since 1981. <p> The reason all of this has happened over the years is that many local jurisdictions have leadership that answers behind the scenes to the middle men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these " Next best things " are bond financed. <p> The middle men that do the finance often work on a percentage basis, so they want to run the tab up as high as possible on any and all of these projects. I refer to the, middle men as " bondits. " Bondits are the next, local problem that needs to be addressed by groups such as the local tea party. Cities and failing suburbs are getting buried under mountains of local debt. Areas that fail due to excessive bonded indebtedness invariably start looking to the federal government for solutions. " Lifelines " from the federal government are invariably tied to a cinder block in the long run. <p> An observation : Ohio and the north are FAR more segregated then Georgia and the Carolinas. Their cities have been failing for a lot longer time then southern cities. Residents of the segregated areas of the north thought that Obama would be their monorail. <p> Just like the " next big thing " that fails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban living black population of metro Atlanta would get a clue. I 'm generally the only white worker at my job, and the blacks that I work with( excepting one) are generally wonderful people. Unfortunately, to a person none of the others will hear anything remotely critical of " the won ". Maybe they have n't seen enough monorails out in their suburbs to get the joke. <p> Could you speak more about these " bondits? " We just had a streetscape pushed on us and next up is the skateboard park. How might one go about finding out who the leadership is that is looking for these middle men. This is a topic which is fascinating to me. <p> Before most of what 's listed is built, a bond issuing authority is generally established. In the state of Georgia, the bond issuing authorities for different jurisdictions are passed through the state legislature. The state legislature NEVER opposes any bond issuing authorities in Georgia. So..... find out if CT law is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities frequently are titled according to the purpose that the bonds are issued for " The Georgia Aquarium Authority, The Fulton-Dekalb Public Hospital Authority, etc. " Find out what authorities are established for what 's financed. Find out who 's involved in the bond hearings. See who 's the hearing counsel for the authorities. They collect part of the take. Have someone else that 's connected find out who invariably gets the take on the bond issuance. Then, you can grab election records to see who the bondits have contributed to. You might not have any luck in this last part, In Georgia, there 's a very strong possibility that money goes under the table to make sure some of what 's proposed ends up being built by the bondits and their buddies. <p> If we can inconvenience Kevin, I 'd be glad to send you some more background on this via e-mail. If Kevin can send your e-mail address to me( I given him an implicit OK if he 's the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how much of these set ups work. re <p> My grandmother had new neighbors move in who were like your neighbors. When they first complained about her walking around in her own apartment, she was surprised, but the second time she BLASTED them. They never bothered her again. It was one of her old lady techniques that caught people off guard, but she saved it for the big stuff. <p> Here is an Ohio ad running sponsored by 40 Ohio doctors warning voters about the dangers and perils of Obamacare. <p> Kevin -- I 'm in Cleveland Heights. I signed up via internet two days ago to work for the Romney Election day task force. Probably around 3 in the afternoon. Within 3 hours, I had been contacted by email thanking me for my information, and promising to be in touch with me soon. Within 24 hours, I have had a personal phone call, and two more emails inviting me to bring friends, and giving details on where personal training meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this is the Romney ground game, it is kick ass. And not to extrapolate too much from this, but if the man runs our country like he runs the ground game here in Ohio, it is very hopeful indeed. <p> When I last lived in an apartment, I had a neighbor who would beat his girlfriend on a regular basis. She had a small child too and that really griped my backside. I would pound on the floor with a broom to make him stop -- or at least figure out someone could hear him and give the gal a break. My husband, then fiance, was none too happy with him either. One weekend I pounded on the floor, again, and screamed I was calling the cops if he did n't stop. He came up the stairs and started pounding on my door. I stood on the other side of it pointing a 9mm at the door with ammo that would punch through the metal and told him he had 3 seconds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord I was shaking like a leaf -- I would have probably hit the ceiling). He left -- got in the car and left. Thankfully for her. <p> The next day I told people at work about what happened... oh, did I mention I " worked " for the police department at the time? Come to find out, the gal was the daughter of the Vice Captain and that was his grand-daughter living there! We also discovered a warrant for him for Assault -- of an 82 year old grandmother -- so I was hoping he 'd screw up again. <p> It was weeks before I saw him again, and it was when they brought him through the front door of the PD and parked him against the wall, in cuffs, in front of my office door. I looked, smiled and waved. <p> When the helicopter takes off with the Obamas from the WH lawn, I am going to be rude and sign, " Nah nah na na hey hey good-bye " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to smile and wave. <p> People who never want to hear any sound whatsoever from their neighbors should not be living in city apartments. While it 's aggravating when people needlessly annoy their neighbors, it 's also aggravating when people think the world should be arranged to make their lives free of the slightest disturbance, and think everyone else should always go around on tippy-toes for their benefit. <p> I love your site! I want to share a quick ground report from an area about 2 hours south of Toledo in NW Ohio. The other day I had an interesting encounter with the UPS delivery guy. He saw the Romney sign in my yard and said something like : " I 'm really glad to see all the Romney signs. All my coworkers are in the union because we have to be, but we all vote conservative... " Granted this area is fairly conservative, but I felt really good after my chat with him! By the way, I am a forensic scientist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 just went to Michelle Obama live. She appears to be testifying to her husband 's character. If she is doing this now, there is a problem. Although they seem to be trying to rip down Romney 's character so maybe it 's part of their grand plan, rip down romney and put up barack? <p> I 'm not sure how much newspaper endorsements are worth in the overall picture, but I was shocked to see that my old hometown newspaper, The Nashville Tennessean, has( tepidly) endorsed Mitt Romney this year : <p> This is a newspaper which has endorsed every leftist Democrat for President for the last 40+ years, including McGovern &; Mondale &; Obama last time, so I was shocked to see this. <p> It 's fun also to go to Dave Leip 's political map site and see how badly Dems have slipped in Tennessee over the last 20 years. Clinton won over 60 counties in 1992. Since then Dem candidates have steadily lost more counties each Presidential election year, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win his home state in 2000. Obama was down to 6 counties in 2008, though including the 2 largest, Shelby( Memphis) and Davidson( Nashville), and he may drop to just those 2 this year : <p> I keep forgetting Memphis is Tennessee... my mental block being in Nashville I guess. The Tennessean is losing money big time. They are not endorsing on their own... they are lefties. However, Nashville is turning on Obama. Small businesses are hurting here. Williamson and Wilson are doing great, but they have been conservative. Mayor dean is making us mad with the property rates going up... the Demos are going to have a tough time I think. I can not tell you the problems we are having collecting payment from customers. We service small businesses and dental offices. They are having a tough time. People are putting off having dental work. Even some of the upscale offices for the swanky areas of town are having a very tough time. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't. <p> You and Justin should NEVER be bullied. In my younger life, I was bullied and no one did anything about it, and I suffered internally. I 'm very happy these obnoxious neighbors moved. My best wishes to you and Justin. <p> Boy, can I relate to your story about sorry neighbors. I remember one time right after I moved out of a bad apartment complex( I had people pounding on my door twice trying to break in, a drunk guy passed out on my stairs, and an idiot below me who insisted on banging on the ceiling all night -- just to name a few things). Anyway, I was mindlessly heading home from church one day not even remembering I 'd moved. Suddenly, it hit me : I did n't have to go back to that horrid place anymore! <p> I think that 's the way it will be when Obama and Co. leave. What a relief it will be to stop having to look over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on you -- or worse yet, passing all kinds of unwelcome laws behind your back! <p> And just think of all the things that Romney will do -- from repealing Obamacare, to getting rid of the unconstitutional czars, to reigning in the EPA, to cutting the crap passed against car dealers and banks and landowners and farmers and businesses, etc. etc. etc. <p> Things are looking up! And I 'm looking forward to voting -- and doing all I can to make this a huge win for R &R.; <p> As annoying as it is, I take heart in how ' noisy ' the left is being because it seems to me that when they are making noise... they are freaked out and trying to cause distractions. I 'd be more worried if they were quiet because that 's sneaky-time. <p> Like the LOL sites have been pushing the ' binder full of women ' meme but is n't working( in fact, one person said if Obama did so well at the last debate then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of Obama 's " stellar performance ")... more and more people just keep commenting and saying that Romney could eat kittens live on stage and they 'd still vote for him. <p> I am so sorry of the nightmare you and Justin have had to endure this past year with those horrible tenants. What they did was horrendous! You did very well the way you handled it, good to hear you both have a good resolution after all. Great analogy in your post too, we live in Northeast Ohio. DH works in Parma, and the surrounding Cleveland area and has for the past 20+ years. I am praying Ohio goes Red for R/R. Your description of how we will feel after R/R gets elected is spot on. I ca n't wait, we feel that this country has been living a nightmare these past 4 years and that the sun will shine and all will be right with the world after R/R is elected. <p> I am a native Ohioan but have been out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for the state anymore. The OH stuff has gotten me a bit eeyorish( sp? :).... but then I put on my thinking cap. We are reading how Romney is taking FL, VA, and NC( the latter months ago, I think). He 's in range in PA and MI. So I ask my Eeyore self -- how freaking likely is it that all of THAT could happen and OH STILL votes for the Forces of Evil? Not very likely. OH always goes for the winner. I 'm guessing we still are seeing OH polls with a Dem skew. <p> LOL!! You sound like me. I go from feeling peaceful and confident this will turn out and then I put on the teevee and hear the " horserace " narrative and start to get the feeling in my stomach. Then I turn off the idiot box and log on to this site and read Kevin 's " Doom antidote " about Obama renting out McCormick Place and it calms me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will save our country. I know some of you are n't religious but it helps me cope. <p> I do feel confident most of the time and dust out those pangs of negativity. I just wo n't tolerate it anymore. <p> Kevin, that CAC person who does the poll stuff at ace of spades hq has a thread up and I found this comment in the comments. I have to admit it gave me agita a bit but I 'm hoping you 'll tell us how to counteract comments like this and that someone will go over and counteract it : <p> " 51 Re : 43, <p> Yeah, my big worry is not so much an Oct. surprise, but some big anti-Romney story released the day before, or day off, the election. Because you do it then -- it does n't even matter if it 's true as long as people believe it. Romney can prove it a complete fabrication on Nov. 7 and that 's one day too late. <p> I could taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a way with words, Kevin. <p> Talked to a friend from my old home of Akron Ohio today. She related a story about another friend of hers there that is distraught with worry about this election. It seems the local news there is showing pictures of early voters who they claim are voting for O in big numbers. I advised her that TeeVee is not to be believed. I prescribed http : //www.hillbuzz.org to be taked in leftish( liberal) doses! I hope she follows my advice. <p> It looks like Obama 's affinity for the Muslim Brotherhood is biting him in his asp! The evening news is avoiding reporting the changing polls so what is left is Middle East terror! <p> I ca n't believe kids this stupid are college students. I think if I were doing the interviews I would ask them WHY they are voting for Obama, and what they are majoring in. I think you could work that into the interview without seeming confrontational. I also think I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they admit that have no idea who Ambassador Chris Stevens is or what happened in Benghazi. I will guarantee you, every single one of them knows who Kim Kardashian is. <p> I would also like to see juxtaposed next to this video, interviews with the students at Hillsdale College. I bet every single one of them knows who Ambassador Stevens is. They can also quote the constitution chapter and verse. <p> Living in Toledo and and also a rural area outside Toledo..... I see a major change in attitudes.... As Kevin says.... Ohioans do nt really whine..... we just give an aura / attitude that you can tell when there is something about to happen..... Its like animals before an earthquake..... people are behaving much differently than in 2008.... I do nt believe Ohio is very close... I predict a 5 point win for Romney....( my gut says 8 points but.....) <p> Kevin, I love your sight! I know a black minister down here in NW Florida( do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's NO WAY he will be voting for Obama next month. He 's very disappointed and embarrassed. Your site gives me hope and happiness. Give Justin a hug for me. Sharon <p> Kevin, I totally agree with you about the relief we all will feel once the Obama 's have left the White House. I ca n't tell you how much anxiety I have felt these past four years! I am genuinely scared for our country, and I am scared for my children. I have gone through a lot in my life, but I have never felt this way about our government before. I have a feeling many others feel the same. <p> You have been a wonderful encouragement, and your humor has brightened countless days. Thanks for all you do Kevin. I am glad you have finally found peace, and on January 20 the nation can have ours.... <p> Austan Goulsby is out there today, speaking for the administration. Remember he left this administration. He was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe he 's willing to risk his career like this. He is a smart guy but he 's trying to defend the indefensible. He should go back to his retirement from the administration. <p> Is it true that Mitt Romney closed down his firm, Bain Capital, and flew 30 workers to New York to look for the missing daughter of one of his colleagues? <p> The fact-finding groups PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com and Truthorfiction.com all rate this as true, and media reports of the day confirm much of the details of the viral email. <p> Although the message has been filling mailboxes, brought to light again now because of Romney 's candidacy, the story has been circulating since he campaigned for the presidency in 2007. It came up then because of a television ad that showed the colleague, Robert Gay, crediting Romney with helping reunite him with his daughter, according to PolitiFact.com, a Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-finding project of the Tampa Bay Times. <p> What eventually came out, as reported in various news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gay, the managing director of Bain Capital, sneaked out of her Connecticut home on July 6, 1996, and took the train to New York. <p> The reports quoted police and sources at Bain as saying that Melissa Gay met up with two men she knew, went with them to a rave party, took several doses of Ecstasy and was last seen at a party in the Bronx. <p> When she did n't come home, her parents called police. <p> The New York Times reported : <p> " As the days went by and her parents, Robert and Lynette Gay, grew more and more frantic, they finally told Mr. Gay 's partners at the private equity-investment firm Bain Capital. A few hours later, executives of the Boston-based firm were on the shuttle to New York for a huge volunteer effort, harnessing corporate manpower throughout the city and immersing professional baby boomers in a youth party culture many knew nothing about.... <p> " Bain Capital 's partners closed down the firm and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. R.R. Donnelly, the firm 's printer, printed more than 300,000 fliers bearing Ms. Gay 's picture and last known whereabouts. Duane Reade, a drugstore chain in which Bain Capital is an investor, had clerks at 52 stores insert fliers in shopping bags.... " <p> Romney was one of the founders and partners of Bain Capital. <p> Various media outlets reported that the 14-year-old was found on July 11 after police traced a call by a teenage boy from New Jersey -- he had taken in the girl unbeknowst to his parents -- who called authorities asking about a reward. <p> Lt. David Peterson of the Montville( N.J.) Township Police told PolitiFact in 2008 that police reports did not mention Romney personally. <p> But the Boston Globe reported that Robert Gay had kept the ordeal to himself, confiding only in Romney. And it was Romney, the Globe stated, who told the other 11 managing directors and they decided that a missing girl came before their firm. <p> In an article in 2002, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for his daughter. <p> " It was the most amazing thing, and I 'll never forget this to the day I die, " Gay told the Globe. " What he did was literally close down an entire business. He basically galvanized an entire industry that just does n't do this, and got them all on the streets for 48 hours. " <p> My teenage daughter texted me that the house by her school that used to have the big Obama sign switched to Romney. <p> Yard signs are 5 to 1 for Romney... on my daily routes, have n't been everywhere. I am noticing lots of local tea party candidate signs. I would venture that the majority of them will vote for Romney. That candidate 's signs are out numbering the democrat running. <p> Tennessee went solid red except for Davidson county( Nashville city limits) in 2010. So seeing more republican signs than democrats is promising. My driving around has been limited to Davidson county. <p> Just a quickie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area north to Erie and saw lots of R/R signs along the way. Not a single obama sign. I also saw R/R bumper stickers and no obama. I 'm finally seeing more bumper stickers around here and all are for Romney. <p> Around the middle of this week, Rush had something about SE Florida. Two of the most Leftist counties went for Obama about +25 in 2008. They are about 3 and 4 in population by county in the state. I would guess Bush lost those counties by about 12% in 2004 which was pretty good. <p> Well they polled those counties with good sample sizes and Obama is up by +4. Within one of the counties, is Wasserman-Schultz district. She is the head of the DNC and in a safe district. She is only polling +4 to 5 and could lose. <p> Obama signs are very hard to find and Romney signs are everywhere. People had to pay for them -- so business people were having thousands of them made using their own money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own signs for people involved in the building trade. <p> Obama will lose Florida. It will not be close. I would guess Romney wins by +6 or +7. The middle class and upper middle class Democrats or people who voted for him are seeing their pocketbook affected. <p> I think nationwide, these O voters who are people who were getting by and who were hanging in their financially during Obama have turned. Everyone knows some friend, fanmily member, friend of a friend who was comfortable before Obama and now they are struggling or broke. People they never thought would crash and burn have. People who are hanging on are thinking -- I could be next. <p> How I love Cleveland. It wears its heart on its sleeve. Our son went to law school at Cleveland John Marshall and I always had so much fun staying and hanging out downtown during our visits. My husband grew up in Beechwood. <p> Interesting your take on the political pulse of that city 's people. <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too, hold life sacred. I know there must be more of you out there. <p> I will vote for Mitt Romney but after all my involvement in the lst election with my volumteering for Hilalry Clinton and then Democrats for McCain Palin I just can not do it for Romney. I agree absolutely that Obama must be defeated and for anyone who believes that Romney could be as bad as Obama I tell them -vote for the first term candidate because he will have to answer to the American public-Obama wo n't and further more the lame stream media holds democrats accountable for nothing. I became a republican becuase of Sarah Palin and the Tea Party. They are our real and only hope for insure a soverign USA. The neo-cons( Bushes) are progressives who will not keep the UN out of our business. The world is slouching towards a global dictator ship. I hear this from Washington insiders. I will support Mitt with my vote but if a true Tea Party Conservative like Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. In a Romney presidency which seems very likely, it is important that we do n't allow progressive policies to further damage the Republican brand. I never likes the elitist Bush Royals. Prescott Bush was a traitor and George H. Bush was the first US president to sign the Agenda 21 treaty at the Rio Earth summitt. Lets make sure Romney understand the power of the Tea Party. <p> You echo the sentiments of so many of us. However, the first order is to see that Barack Obama is defeated. I know I 'm preaching to the choir but getting where we want to be -- a true conservative, Constitutionalist party and government will take much, much time and effort and election after election after election. <p> Our day in the sun is coming. Do not despair. But we need all hands on deck to unleash the power we have and show it to the country and to the world. The Left has engaged in some mighty magical thinking, putting the Tea Party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the radar because you feel that our candidate is not( yet) conservative enough. I fully expect Romney to want to weasel his way over to the center after the election. Between the Tea Party and( with hope) Paul Ryan and our new, stronger Congress we will keep him from doing it. <p> It has taken the Progressive Left dupes a century to get where they are. We can take our country back much quicker than that, but it 's going to take time. Our next tasks will unfold themselves soon enough after the election. But do not disengage from this next crucial step. It 's the top banana. The big Kahuna. If we miss it, it 's all over. Happy voting. I wish you well. <p> early voting has started in north carolina and according to the civitas election tracker, democrat early voting is down by 5% compared to the same day of early voting in 08, while rep and unaffiliated voting is up by a combined 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange counties( very left counties... i live in durham), but up in wake( conservative leaning). <p> speaking of signs... in durham, there are more obama yard signs than romney... but not neaarrrrrly as many obama signs as in 08. <p> i did a drive through around my neighborhood last sunday and noticed that even most people who still have anti-prop 1 signs do not have obama signs.( prop 1 was on the ballot in may... anti-gay marriage amendment to the state constitution.) <p> of course, it was n't just leftists who voted against prop 1... but in my neighborhood at least, the yard signs were in yards that typically sport leftist signage. <p> Your stories about the gay communities in Chicago and other places are quite the shocker for me. I guess I grew up near Austin, TX( second highest population of gays in the US) and they 've been there for years and they never gathered in clumps. <p> This I took from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a gay neighborhood, the whole city is gay friendly. " That 's pretty accurate. Austin is one of the most friendly cities in the US and you 'll find a gay neighbor or two in most neighborhoods around Austin.) <p> And from living there I 'd say that 's exactly what I saw. There are n't really places where the gays gather to live. They live all over the place and always have. Sure there are a ton of gay bars on Sixth Street where they gather to party, but they do n't form " neighborhoods ". <p> Even outside Austin in Round Rock where my dad work as a high school teacher they 're pretty spread out. You 'll often finding them living where ever. Heck, my parents knew a lesbian couple who lived right in the middle of a super-conservative neighborhood. They were known, but they were never excluded from neighborhood parties or anything. Everyone just agreed to disagree and leave it at that. <p> The High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesbian club( they split up because the homosexual men and the lesbians ended up despising each other. Go figure.) <p> So the concept of forming " gay neighborhoods " is very different for me. <p> I am not sure if this could be considered a bright spot, but I think this might mean something : <p> I live in Oregon, as anyone who has read already knows. I 've seen more Romney/Ryan signs out, but I have seen a number of Obama/Biden and 2(Obama)12 signs. Bumper stickers are mostly Obama 2008 and just a few Obama 2012. Very few Romney ones because of the unhinged leftist vandals out here. <p> TV, however, indicates a lot of where Oregon is going. Whoever is advertising more is losing ground. And Romney has not been advertising at all. Obama 's commercials have been on cable out here, and I see them every morning as I watch my 1.5 hours of ' Frasier '. <p> Obama is likely to take Oregon by 2-3, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County, which is Portland, and the eastern suburb of Gresham. Fairview, Troutdale, and rural Multnomah County will go Romney, but too many in Portland are leftist-hacks. <p> Oregon also has Lane County, which is the Eugene area. That 's the university area. Lane will generally go Obama like Portland, because that 's what it does. Outside of Eugene, Lane County generally bleeds a deep bright red. But the Left of Eugene turns it to a Blue-Purple. <p> The bellwether out here is Columbia County, which is NW of Portland and is a mix of commuters and farmers/loggers ; It will likely go to Obama by 1 or less. <p> If we could get a lot of people out here to do more convincing of the rich/affluent left-leaners out here... Romney could have a shot. <p> I was at a Richard Murdock. Chris Christie event Wednesday in merrillville at the Radisson and some seniors told me they used to vote democrat and voted for Obama but not this time. they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney support here. <p> I 'm not an Eeyore, quietly optimistic at this point. The word " landslide " is on my lips, but I have n't said it out loud yet. Only typed it. Anxious days ahead, but I think Romney 's got this. Did you see how classy he and Anne looked last night? I want that back for our country. <p> jeeze... how bad is chicago these days that you can still think that cleveland is a nice place?!? the only more deserted, boarded-up craphole i 've ever seen is detroit but it 's a close race between the two cities. i 'm allowed to say so because i, too, was born and raised in cleveland and its ' burbs, although i escaped from there over forty years ago. it was n't the lack of jobs back then that drove me away but the fact that cleveland was always at least ten years( twenty years?) behind the times and most folks there, much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about... much of anything really... except for sports, sports, SPORTS!!!( what other ' major ' city would put grade school sports scores on the front page of their newspaper?) so it 's little wonder that, over the years, they thought that new stadiums would save them from total ruin. now we see the grandchildren of my generation in that ohio state video who have never heard of anything and consider that to be completely ' normal '( normalcy being held in high regard in that neck of the woods.) obviously, you are still in much closer contact with the citizens of cleveland and its environs, so i defer to your superior knowledge and do hope that the vibes you are getting are the right ones. winning ohio would, almost certainly, put romney over-the-top. fingers crossed. i did get a laugh and a little blast from the past from your mention of parma... way back in my time in cleveland there was a local t.v.horror movie host who called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to have a very succesful announcing career) whose most famous ' joke ' was simply shouting, " PARMA!!! " at random moments... and making references to white socks( never got what was so funny/wrong about white socks but i guess everybody wore black or brown back then). i even lived in parma for a couple of months and still never figured out what was so funny about the bland, little ' burb full of bland, little houses... but i can see that there may be some validity to your theory that, as goes parma, so goes the state. as i said, fingers crossed. <p> I live in The Heart of It All.. Columbus, Ohio.. it was very evident, fairly early on that BHO was in trouble.. I am out and about all day in my job and talk to a lot of people... if you only went by the lack of bumper sticks that was very telling... not many yard signs and ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. who was a very popular teacher.. won many awards, teacher of the year etc. and she is a Dem.. I see a lot of her yard signs.. but there are no BHO signs next to hers... I found that a bell weather sign. The Columbus " Disgrace " Dispatch endorsed Romney.. and it has been leaning leftist since the Cleveland gang took over after publisher John W. Wolfe passed away... <p> ok listen up, I have just learned that miracles are still likely to happen. <p> The ACT elections were held today. The ACT was where I was living for the past 6 years. It was moribund thanks to the ALP/Greens. <p> I have just been watching the early election returns and there has been a shock!! <p> There has been a swing to the Liberal Party and away from the Marxist Greens aka the Watermelon Party. It is not possible to know whether or not the Liberal Party have a majority because of the voting system. <p> I am shocked! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party took control after Rosemary Follett had been such a stuff up. I just did not think it would happen again. <p> I am ecstatic because if this translated into what can happen in the Federal election then at least one of the two Canberra seats will end up being very marginal. <p> I should add here that the person who is the MP for where I was living is a total jerk. He is one of these warmist alarmist types and he really gets carried away. If people just stopped and thought about their vote then such people would not end up in the Parliament. However, that is not the Canberra way!! <p> So, I will update when I know more. This is not what I was expecting for Canberra. Miracles can happen, and perhaps this is an omen for your Presidential elections. <p> It is not all bad news though. According to figures direct from the AEC site, the Canberra Liberals have 8 seats, the ALP has 7 seats and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Party have lost 2 seats. I was hoping that they would lose 3 seats but there are a lot of people with mush for brains from South Australia living there at present. The remainder are simply the rusted on Public Servants and you can not change their minds because they are so stupid( they do as the union asks). <p> It looks like the ALP will continue in government, which is sad, but now they only rely upon 2 Watermelons for support. <p> My cousin, raised in Michigan, married a wonderful Ohioan. They reside there with their wonderful children. Her husband 's entire family are democrat, middle of the road dems. They fell into the thrill of Obama in 2008. Fast forward to today, and his family is either voting for Romney or not voting at all. <p> He has a large family, so 48 votes Obama is not getting this time around from Ohio. While I realize this is not scientific, it is an indication and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if the democrat party can get their people to the polls. The same goes here in Michigan.It is my theory on why the
