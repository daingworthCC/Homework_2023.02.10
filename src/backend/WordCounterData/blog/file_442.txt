5152541 <h> It will be a Romney break-out <p> I 'm going out on a limb here folks and predicting we are going to see a swath of red in the election in Nov. like we have n't seen since 1980 when Reagan mopped the floor with Carter. More than 70 million viewers watched the first debate -- it was one of the most-watched debates in history. <p> Check out what is going on in Ohio with early/absentee voting. In 2008, 33% of the absentee ballots went to Democrats and just 19 percent to registered Republicans, a 14-point gap ; This year 29 percent are being requested by Democrats and 24 percent by Republicans, a five-point gap. But it gets even better. <p> As a result of removing 450,000 dead folks and duplicate multiple registrations off the voter rolls( the vast majority of whom were Democrats) critical precincts that had strong Dem advantages in 2008 now have Republican advantages in registered voters or the gap has severely narrowed. For instance, the Columbus area had a +5 Democrat advantage in 2008 -- now it has a +5 Republican advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Although it is early, we will soon be at a point where -- assuming Republicans vote for Romney -- the Democrats will have to overwhelmingly win all the remaining early voting just to be even on November 6. But, given Ohio 's voting history, if the numbers are even close after early voting, Obama will lose, and possibly lose big. "( Read more about the Ohio Surprise here). <p> Best of all, the latest Rasmussen poll( with a slightly Dem skewed sample -- see above) taken on the first post-debate day, has Romney ahead among likely voters by 51-48 in Ohio. <p> As Star Trek 's Captain Picard would say, " Make it so. " Especially if you live in a swing state, but any and every state is important : get your vote in for Romney. I say it is time to blow the Reagan record -- vote for restoring the nation 's strength, integrity, prosperity and for a future for your children less bleak than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be ignored. <p> I agree minx. The people have made up their minds @ least all but a few. We must ignore the goebblesque propaganda of the msm( whose combined viewership is less than 20 million people for their news broadcast). We shouldnt trust the usps to deliver or return absentee ballots. We should go to the polls and vote. Write in @ least 1vote so there is a physical piece of paper.i used to vote for my dog anytime a dhimmicrat ran unopposed. Now get out there and vote it ai nt over till its over. Just a note the Hebrew Torah code has Romney as the winner in 2012. im sure most have heard of it.i just thought it was interesting. <p>( For those who do n't know, gematria is a system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase, in the belief that words or phrases with numerical values bear some relation to each other, or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Numerical values correlated with words or phrases or passages within the Torah can be added and subtracted etc and thus a new " meaning " obtained from the result. Hmmm just looking at my explanation it does n't seem I explained it terribly well. Feel free to ask questions and I 'll try to explain better if you are confused <p> You probably refer to the Bible code( see also : http : **33;5230;TOOLONG). By the way, I am working on a Sci-Fi story based upon the idea that the Bible encodes instructions for building a time machine ; and that whomever deciphered the Bible and built the time machine, also sent a copy of the Bible( of course written in paleo-Hebrew script http : **35;5265;TOOLONG...) to the far past for interception by the Hebrews and preservation, closing the loop. <p> Bill Mayer said that Obama took the million dollars he gave him and spent it on weed. I think Obama supporters are backing off, not wanting to be contaminated by the lies and manipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless leader. <p> I think Obama will win, and we must get ready for the worst from him. Call me a pessimist but you can not swing the balance with only one good show. Whoever controls the media, controls the elections, and it 's not the GOP, in my humble opinion. <p> Larry007, I am scared to death, too. I dare not hope, because Obama and his thugs operate out of the corrupt Chicago political tradition, so there is always fraud, and as you say, the corrupt media like CNN, protect Obama. I agree, the liberal control the media, but now Leno and Mayer are making jokes at Obama 's expense... so maybe there will be enough of a shift to counteract the vile " journalists " like Soledad O'Brien and Chris Matthews... these people are merely propagandists. <p> Well, you know what, I truly hope for the USA and for the American people that it will be Mitt Romney at the White House soon! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US deficit at over $16 TRILLION for the end of the second term of Obama if he would manage to fool a second time the American people!! And the already painful sacrifices that the American people will have to put up with to get out of this US deficit, the sacrifices after $22 TRILLION of US deficit would be much, much worse for the American people!! <p> When I saw Obama at the debate with Mitt Romney without Obama having the possibility to use his teleprompter, I thought to myself, well I understand now how this idiot has squandered more than $6 TRILLION during his four years at the Presidency, as he simply lives in an ideological bubble without any awareness of the economic world around him!! <p> By the way, I thought Obama had squandered " only " $5 TRILLION since he took office but the latest number, taking into account 2012, indicates that it is in fact $6 TRILLION. In case you are not good with numbers, $1 TRILLION=$1,000 BILLION!! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a huge number, $6,000 BILLION ADDED TO THE US DEFICIT UNDER OBAMA 'S NIGHTMARE!! <p> I know, it is hard to believe how Obama could have squandered so much and get the awful results that he got, that is no results at all!! But when you remember that he squandered $90 BILLION to financially " support " " green " companies( most of them went bankrupt afterward and most of them were managed by people who financially supported Obama 's presidential election!!!)
