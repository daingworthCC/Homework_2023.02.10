Alas, it 's all virtual -- it 's a vignette from the latest EA Sports FIFA World Cup title. <p> I have to admit, watching that clip of the Warriors squaring off against Rooney &; Co., with Maximus Dan blasting in the background and red, white and black balloons and flags flying high -- I got chills. <p> Trinbagonians everywhere are counting down the days until our Warriors really do walk on to the German pitches. Where ever we may be -- in Germany, in Trinidad, in far flung parts
