Like for example, this article about how J.R.R Tolkien is evil, and because it did n't mention anything about God nor Jesus, your going to hell if you even glance at it! Yep your going to that fictional, fiery, place that people go because they did n't fall for the BS religion and chosen to live the lifestyle that the Church has condemned as evil! <p> As if that 's not bad enough, the all-so-perfect Christian religion cant even all agree on rather or not Christmas is about celebrating the birth of baby-Jesus or if it 's evil PAGANISM! Wow! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself! <p> So not even Christians are sure of what BS their shoveling down our throats these days, it 's only still around after all these years because it survived with hypocrisy and lies!.... maybe someday the world would kill this cancerous religion off for good! <p> Well in conclusion I was better off researching other religions then pretending that Christianity was really the answer and I want all of AFF to know that I 'm spiritual and not a Christian! I believe there 's some form of a higher power or being. <p> Rather its an almighty deity or an advance alien race that mankind in the ancient past has called a God, or " those who has descended from the Heavens( sky) " I believe that there 's a force of higher knowledge.... <p> I 'm sick of Christians condemning everything that they dislike, or disagree with, as evil... : / <p> Well in conclusion I was better off researching other religions then pretending that Christianity was really the answer and I want all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian! I believe there 's some form of a higher power or being. <p> lol- young(ish) is a catholic( christian) and goes to catholic school( obviously chosen by her parents) yet she is considering different relgions all the time.. She respects judaism a whole lot... and the other day we all joked maybe we should switch to protestant..( aside : keep politics out of religion - scoffs - seems hard for many to do these days...) I am currently enjoying the idea of episcopalian( but go to catholic Mass still om Sundays). My current belief : all roads lead to the same place. <p> P.s as to thread title/topic : Just like so called " news " channels - the ideals of each religion is different depending on which channel you watch...( church you go to) person you listen to... PEOPLE TRANSLATE or purposefully try to twist things to their own plans( not thsoe of G*d) <p> My version of religion says " judge not " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is welcome and love is the answer and accept the outcasts = treat them as one would treat Jesus Himself... Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, that you do unto me. No one is evil inherently... G*d does not make mistakes( etc.,) <p> I would not attend worship services at such a church that believes that Tolkien books and films are evil and that celebrating Christmas is wrong. However if some people want that then fine. I would let them. Why bother listening to them or viewing their website. I would not waste my time. <p> I went to a church like that growing up. I felt a lot of anger against them for a while but now - I feel very, deeply sad for them. They have so much rage, so much angst. It is a miserable existence. <p> Organizations like this exist in the U.S., but most are not that way My mother had a hard time finding another one after she had a disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intervention for her under the pretense of funding her mission trip. It was because she was sending my brother to *gasp! * catholic school instead of the local christian school that taught - wait for it - the world is flat, and does not spin. Yes, really. <p> There is a joke that goes like this : <p> A guy dies and goes to heaven. As St. Peter is showing him around, he notices a group of people huddled together in a tight circle, eyes shut, muttering angrily to one another. Confused, the man inquires about the group. <p> " Oh them? " St. Peter replies, " Those are the Fundamentalists. They still think they 're the only ones here! " <p> They 're actually planning to boycott the Hobbit when it comes out I believe. <p> So long as they do n't stop others seeing it, who cares? <p> What 's hilarious is that tolkien was indeed christian and his work is full of christian themes, even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ainur by one of their own( a fallen angel causes evil, sound familiar?). <p> Then there 's that whole concept of " sub-creation " and why only Eru has the power of creation. <p> Quote : <p> OK, I 'm happy for you if you find a religion and live with it, happily. I 'm fine with that. <p> Like any mature and good person is I imagine, however.... <p> Quote : <p> What I am not fine with is, cramming your beliefs down the throats of others. THAT really pisses me off. So many Christians these days, at least from my experiences are doing so. <p> If you count boycotting a movie in this, you 're wrong - that 's not forcing their beliefs on you. Otherwise I agree. <p> Quote : <p> It 's my choice to choose what I believe, and if I go to hell for it... So be it. DO N'T try to " save my soul " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shut up those who wo n't give up by blaspheming the holy spirit in front of them - apparently that 's the only unforgivable sin, be sure to also point this out too. <p> Say that, you 're right about them(( WHICH YOU ARE NOT)) and their sexuality is a choice, again then can burn in hell for it. Not worth your time trying to save their souls either. <p> Even if homosexuality is a choice why the hell would that matter? That 's something that 's always annoyed me about some gay rights activists - rather than focusing on the real issue( i.e who the hell cares about other people 's sexuality and why should they) they spread around this idea that " people do n't choose to be gay " as if that is the only reason why homosexuality is morally acceptable. <p> The real reason homosexuality is morally acceptable is because it does n't harm anyone - neither does any other sexuality so long as all involved are consenting. <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what flavour of icecream you enjoy - most people prefer vanilla( straight), some might prefer chocolate( gay), some might enjoy both( bi), some may not like icecream at all( asexual). <p> I like vanilla( i 'm male, attracted to females) and dislike chocolate( I am not attracted to other males - unless John Barrowman counts.......), but who the hell cares? If the chocolate icecream lovers want to use glass bowls that were historically reserved for vanilla icecream( marriage - and I know this analogy is getting strained now) then why the hell should I object to that either? My glass bowl with vanilla is just as awesome even if someone out there is enjoying their glass bowl with chocolate. <p> I 'm agnostic and it depresses me. I wish there was a god. I hope there is. The idea of never seeing those I love who died ever again makes me sick. I feel like
