5125541 <p> " My two uncles will be rolling over in their grave, " said Dickinson, 85, who has cast ballots since age 21 and the late 1940s. <p> A Jamul resident, Dickinson said he has been staying with his seriously ill wife at the Marengo Avenue assisted living center near Kaiser Permanente in La Mesa. <p> He says he admired former Gov. Romney for his work in making his former state a business success. And he also cited Romney 's father, George, for achievements as head of American Motors before becoming governor of Michigan. <p> " Look what he 's done for Massachusetts, " Dickinson said of the GOP candidate after dropping off his absentee ballot and chatting with poll workers for 10 minutes. <p> He recalled the late Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, and joked about his encouraging supporters to " vote early and often. " <p> Dickinson also praised President Franklin Roosevelt, and even his wife, Eleanor, who he said suggested elements of the New Deal that helped bring the country out of Depression. <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The octogenarian, whose uses a walker, accused Obama of messing the country up by helping Goldman Sachs and aiding the rich and not those suffering in the economy. <p> Dickinson said he grew up near Kansas City, MO, but has lived in San Diego County since getting out of the Air Force in 1954. <p> Oh, Kevin, my constant nemesis, Walter and wife get Medicare, which will never be the same for our generation if Romney wins. Walter likes what Romney did with Mass. but he does n't mention the state health plan that Romney was forced to endorse late in the game to save his butt -- and that made insurance so much more affordable... you know, the same thing O is trying to do. <p> Walter and his wife have got THEIRS -- that is, affordable health care that wo n't leave them bankrupt -- so they can well afford to vote to screw the rest of us... you know, their children and grandchildren. <p> It always bugs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the " Greatest Generation " -- when our own generation( Baby Boomers like the two of us) would have answered the call in even greater and fiercer numbers if we had been under threat of being taken over by a mass murderer dictator like Hitler instead of being forced to die in some tiny obscure nation like Vietnam that never threatened the American way at all! <p> Kevin, I guess your " ignore " button failed ya this time. Looks like O is winning! If he does n't, I wo n't post here again till after Christmas. I can understand why you and Walter might be upset in that the two of you do n't get to decide who is president anymore. I 'll see you here tomorrow... or after Christmas. <p> Batman -- Affordable health insurance. I ca n't get it because I had a cardiac arrest in 2005. This happened because of a rare but deadly interaction of two prescription drugs. My heart is healthy but that does n't matter to insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record. " What people do n't understand is that having to go to the E.R., like I did recently, for an issue not cardiac related at all, is not without consequences. Sharp Grossmont came out swinging, threatening my credit rating. So, you see, American citizens are suffering this kind of fate, too... not just illegals. Thanks for asking. <p> Interesting. What were the two drugs that reacted with each other? Why did n't your pharmacist catch this before he dispensed the drugs to you? How much was your civil settlement against the pharmacist? Is this incompetent pharmacist still in business? <p> It was mainly due to a blood pressure drug and what happened to me was listed on the package insert as a very rare side effect.
