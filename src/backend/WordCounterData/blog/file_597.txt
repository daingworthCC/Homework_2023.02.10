You 'll end up being let down, hurt and in all reality ending in worshipping a human to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C) WIll give them a type of authority in your life they may not be qualified to have. Highly influential in parts of your life they have no expertise, wisdom or knowledge on. <p> EXAMPLE : Asking your bro about marriage issues when he has no sense of what a stable relationship even looks like. <p> EXAMPLE : Asking a friend about financial direction and advice when he still lives with his mom in her basement yet drives and Audi A4 fully loaded. <p> But the BIGGEST reason why I do n't want you to idolize or find your identitty in another person is because then that means you are n't you. <p> You 're like BOB who finds his identity in being the manager of Hot Topic. <p> You 're like Chris who finds his identity in being the singer of a metal band. <p> You be you, you walk your path. You believe in what you believe, not because someone tells you to, but because it 's YOU who truly believes in it. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a purpose. All wtih tools and gifts... if we walk around finding our identity in other people and their gifts, then how is it we are to live out our lives with our own. <p> You were created and you are original. Keep it that way, and write your own book in this world. <p> It 's ok to be inspired and to use wisdom and experiences from others to help clear dirt off on your own path you walk. Just make sure it 's your path you are walking. I personally try hard not to idolize people I look up to, and focus on my own path with Christ. <p> Thank you Jake!! This is a very important subject for teenagers of today!! God bless you man! I have finally learned this one too. That if I 'm trying hard to be another, then who should be me? <p> Kevin Thompson <p> Nice article Jake, Enjoyed it, it really is true... I found myself when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life, I just thought If I was like them my life would be so much better, or I would be happier, w.e the lie was. Over time you realize that you never will be and you start to think less of yourself and do n't value yourself. Knowing that God created us specially unique for a specific purpose, with individual traits is awesome! I have learned over the years to come to acepting who I am, and what I can and ca n't do / who I want to hang out with / how I choose to act around people <p> Jacobluhrs <p> It 's still something i find myself doing! haha I 'll be like man that dude has it all together, then I come to the realization that no one really has it all together. I think it 's another reason why having brothers you can really share personal information with is healthy. It continues to not only bring things out in your life that have been in the dark but shows you that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thanks for reading! God Bless <p> Ben <p> Thanks so much Jake, hope the European tour was great! <p> david <p> I did this for a long time, for years.Only months ago was I brought out of my identity crisis because of God.And He 's let me know and helped me to renew my mind in finding who I am in Him.And finding my own potential and making my own decisions, with His help.But it 's still a work in progress, but
