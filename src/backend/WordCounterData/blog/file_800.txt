5188841 <p> Even though I had a curable cancer, you can not stop thinking when will it come back, where will it be. It 's only time. But then you hear of someone else 's story like Mel and you realize how blessed you truly are. How grateful you are and how honored you are to be able to give just a little that might help someone else. <p> Thank you Mel for inspiring all of us that are still here and thankful for each day that we have and are able to share with our families and others. Please all of those who are are fighting stay strong. Never give up hope. Never quit. There
