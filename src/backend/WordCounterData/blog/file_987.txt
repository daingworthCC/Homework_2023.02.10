5207741 <h> Rihanna 's throwing a who 's who Halloween Bash at Greystone Manor October 31 and Chris ' friends say ' he 's definitely going ' but the big question remains -- is he bringing Karrueche? Find out only at HollywoodLife.com! <p> There 's an old saying " never bring sand to the beach " but when you 're Chris Brown, you do n't necessarily follow conventional wisdom. HollywoodLife.com has learned that while Chris will be at Rihanna 's A-List Halloween Bash, friends of the rappers say it would be better if Karrueche Tran sat this one out. <p> " Even though Ri cool with what 's going on between the three of them I ai n't sure if she trying to have KT all up in her party, " a source EXCLUSIVELY reveals to HollywoodLife.com. " And KT do n't want to go. Ri 's crew do n't like her. KT should keep her a** at home. " <p> Whether Karrueche will be attending is not Chris ' only problem -- he 's still trying to figure out what his costume will be. <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that might be too much work. He just might wear plain clothes or a mask or some sh**. " <p> Sounds like Rihanna 's Halloween Bash will be the most anticipated party come October 31. HollywoodLife.com has learned the " Diamonds " singer dropped more than $100,000 to rent out the space and and will have a 300-person guest list, as well as an open bar! <p> The bottom line is that CB is young, imature and is probably thinking with the wrong head as some would say. what could KT offer him really, but a house full of babies and then run off and collect child support and alimony UNTIL? Somebody needs to wake the young man up. I ' m just saying, though. I am going to still be supporting him and RiRi. I love them both. If he keep messing up he will eventually lose me as a fan. It could be the media putting fuel on the fire. The truth will soon reveal itself. <p> This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool of Rihanna. When will enough be enough? This woman declared her love publicly for a man who lied, said he broke it off with his chick to be with her, then he 's all over the place with Karreuche. Maybe he was never interested in getting back with Rihanna in the first place. Maybe he WANTS to publicly humiliate her out of anger. Just a theory... He does n't act like a man giving someone a second shot at love. And no offense, Rihanna needs to wake up. She 's a megastar, leave him alone and move on to someone new who will not treat her worse than dirt on the street. And shame on the media, some fans for egging this " reunion " on in the first place knowing this crap would happen. Look at how their relationship was from jump... toxic. <p> I like how everyone is like Rihanna will be upset..... Rihanna will be the one being disrespected... Rihanna this Rihanna that whatever Rihanna disrespected kae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @ shay shay THANK YOU! There are still people with some common sense and morals left in this world. People forget that Kae and Chris were in a two-year relationship and Rihanna was the one who interfered with her " imma make you my b*@ch " /rice cake agenda. That is what this is all about. She made it a vow to destroy Kae 's relationship because she could n't stand the fact that Chris was ina real relationship and openly claiming Kae. And she succeeded, but you know what, what goes around comes around. Life is not a fairy tale and this story is not over. I just feel sorry for Chris when it is all said and done and he has to work hard to get his fan back after he dumps Rihanna. <p> Rihanna becomes stupid days by days!!! On her twitter shes posts pics " black pyramid clothes " etc... i am so dissapointed of her behavior!!! she 's famous and pretty, and she stays focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a good way and example for hers fans!! Do n't forgot he beats her, he cheats kae for her, he wants back with kae again and got rih like!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p> i hope KT goes then that would be real fun. That would really help this triangle you guys keep building for us. Never mess with Bajans -- trust me on that. Oh KT do nt want to go does she hmmm i wonder why?. Perhaps because the entrance costs more than $20 or maybe she is just too chicken to actually face people who are real celebs and work for their money. Ahem side piece? is that what women have become these days. Also will the source be going to this party -- I do nt think so. General entrace costs are $ 500 and VIP ticket costs are $ 2500 -- 3000. And on this subject of if Ri being fine with whats going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ri is a strong independent working woman who is not dependent on Chris for anything. I doubt she or any woman would be fine with this scenario and lets face it this is demeaning to women everywhere in the world especailly Chris mom Joyce hawkins. Can you guys stop with the triangle its really got to the stage where people are going totally off Chris for this. Unless you peoples goal is to destroy Chris career completely with this triangle strory please stop this and examine your sources because on other websites the sources are saying something else. <p> Who is totally independent in this world? Please choose your words wisely. Whatever this a man wants to do for a woman is his business. Obviously Chris Brown wants to provide for Karrueche Tran, so be it. He seems to care for her maybe not in a realtionship but her well being. some people aren'tgood in a relationship but are better being friends. <p> Sooo, staying with a man who is seeing another woman would be " demeaning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of DNA who beat the crap out of her IS N'T demeaning? Gee, thanks for lending an air of rationality to the discussion. <p> What a stupid post... totally pointless. No sh*t he 's not gon na bring her and no sh*t he should n't bring her and no sh*t KT is n't going to go... Please HL.... i get that this is a hot story, but i 'm sure there 's enough crazy stuff going on with this ' love triangle ' that you do n't
