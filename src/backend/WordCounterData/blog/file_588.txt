5167241 <h> Disney Buys Lucasfilm, Announces New Star Wars Movie For 2015 <p> Less than three years after buying Marvel for $4 billion, The Walt Disney Company has announced it will acquire Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion in cash and stock. With the news arrives word that a new Star Wars movie will be released in 2015. <p> Current Lucasfilm co-chair Kathleen Kennedy will become Lucasfilm president, reporting to Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn, and serve as brand manager for the Star Wars franchise. In addition she will be executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, including Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015, " with more feature films expected to continue the Star Wars saga and grow the franchise well into the future. " <p> During a conference call this afternoon with investors, Disney CEO Robert Iger indicated new installments will be released every two to three years after that. " We love the fact that this will take its place in our live-action strategy as a known and loved brand, " he said. " We really like Star Wars ' potential on TV, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> George Lucas, who announced his plans to retire in June, will serve as creative consultant on the franchise. <p> " For the past 35 years, one of my greatest pleasures has been to see Star Wars passed from one generation to the next, statement. " It 's now time for me to pass Star Wars on to a new generation of filmmakers. I 've always believed that Star Wars could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime. I 'm confident that with Lucasfilm under the leadership of Kathleen Kennedy, and having a new home within the Disney organization, Star Wars will certainly live on and flourish for many generations to come. Disney 's reach and experience give Lucasfilm the opportunity to blaze new trails in film, television, interactive media, theme parks, live entertainment, and consumer products. " <p> Under the terms of the deal, Disney acquires full ownership of Lucasfilm, including its live-action film production, animation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ltd. in 1971 with the release of THX1138, followed four years later by by the creation of the pioneering special-effects company Industrial Light &; Magic, Sprocket Systems( renamed Skywalker Sound in 1979) and Lucas Licensing. Those divisions were joined over the next three decades by Lucasfilm Games( later LucasArts), Lucas Online and Lucasfilm Animation. <p> UPDATE : Lucas and Kennedy talk about the sale to Disney and the future of Star Wars in the video below. <p> I never post replies to anything but I 'm sorry, star wars is just apart of my history as anyone else so I feel I have a say. For starters I see a lot of comments bashing episodes 1-3. How else could they have gone? They were great! The stories wove in nicely to the older ones. They selected a perfect actor for young obi wan and introduced some great new characters. Second, this was Georges vision. This guy thought up this entire Universe so how do u figure the creator " ruined " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really expect them to shoot the films like they did in the 70s? I 'm vexed that Disney is taking over this epic saga. which brings me to marvel movies. I ca n't comment on the avengers because I have n't seen it. Every single marvel movie I 've watched was horrible. I think the only one that was decent was the blade trilogy. I could go on for ages about how horrible x-men was. I can see how some people are mad that episodes 1-3 did try to appeal to younger generations but disney is gon na take it to whole new level. Leave this great saga alone Disney! <p> Miketurbill <p> IF disney and lukas film industry produce the next series of films which were set 25 years after the destruction of the death star, so the original actors could play their original roles and intro duction of next generation of actors to carry on franchise as they did in star trek.after all the originaly there were supposed to be nine films. <p> http : //squidoo.com/retroblogs Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DS 9. <p> Josh <p> Good. You stay home while the rest of us go watch it! <p> Guestsoundsgood <p> I remember that episode. Return of Yar, right? How exactly did they address logistical issues while they were spending the episode doing the Denise Crosby alternate universe love story, the hackneyed treatment of theoretical physics( nothing new there...) and the thirty minutes of Whoopi Goldberg screen-time? I mean, I 'm really trying to see how that comment is anything but hyperbole. Unless of course by " a far more realistic portrayal of the result of ongoing galactic war " you mean everyone dying. Which I guess sort of would seem a bit more believable than everyone walking out the other side of DS9 alive. <p> Ziekesx <p> Kingdom Hearts style o.O <p> whippis <p> I think it is fantastic. Maybe we 'll get les tinkering with what we grew-up loving and get someone who grew-up inspired by Star Wars to return it to first principles and continue the story we all really wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films, but something is better than nothing. Good for George to let go and congrats on the mondo payday. Capitalism is wonderful. <p> whippis <p> I think it is fantastic. Maybe we 'll get les tinkering with what we grew-up loving and get someone who grew-up inspired by Star Wars to return it to first principles and continue the story we all really wanted to see. Maybe it will be a terrible set of films, but something is better than nothing. Good for George to let go and congrats on the mondo payday. Capitalism is wonderful. <p> joshua <p> I will explain why I liked it. <p> 1. The characters were deeper. 2. The stories progressed and evolved from week to week. 3. Most of the characters were morally grey or became so as the series progressed. 4. The Maquis and Section 31 showed that things were n't all sunshine and light with the Federation. Their was corruption in the federation. Some people in the Federation wanted out. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in this so called utopia. 5. DS9 seemed less like a talk show in space like TNG did. 6. The themes of war addressed in DS9 were prescient and the show is MORE relevant in a post 9/11 world than it was when it aired. Enemies who want our destruction and can look like us? Yup. Corrupt powers in our government manipulating events in the war for their agenda? Yep. Children being orphaned by war? Yup. Unreliable allies who pursue their own agendas? Yup. Enemy combatants who think everyone who does n't revere their higher power should be destroyed? Yep. Maverick service men who resort to their own brand of terrorism to even the score with their enemies? Yep. Torture of prisoners? Yep. 7. The other shows did a lot of universe building but every week they went off to do another adventure. The other shows built the shared universe... DS9 was the only show who made good use of the shared universe. 8. Voyager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9. Garek. The most fascinating Trek character ever. 10. Gul Dukat... a morally complex villain. <p> Guest <p> I 'm amazed that no one has asked this question yet, as far as I 've seen. Now that Lucas has been removed from the equation, will we actually get the original versions of the films in a format which is not a complete slap in the face? If Disney is all about the dollar and ratings, how could they not release the original editions to the hordes of fans who 've been demanding it for years? Lucas is a delusional, ego driven maniac in the midst of a mid-life crisis and needs to be restrained from ruining more of my childhood. <p> MaleKim <p> I think Disney might want to consider changing their theme song to something other than " When You Wish Upon A Star. " <p> MaleKim <p> Also, go to deviantart.com and do a search on " disney lucas " or " new death star. " <p> Liam <p> It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do nt get it. <p> The Lucas has now sucked it for real. Maybe he has finally gotten tired of Star Wars fans( like myself) that are tired of him fracking up the rotation, as it were... I mean Disney isnt even doing the " Trilogy that shouldve been " aka " The Thrawn Trilogy " that came after Return of the Jedi?!? WTH are they doing then?!?!? You know what -- I say eff it
