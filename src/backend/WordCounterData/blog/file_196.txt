5127741 <h> Monday, October 15, 2012 <h> The gorilla at the end of the Windows 8 tunnel <p> I actually did n't know about gorilla arm until a few days ago when someone posted an article related to it in a Windows 8 forum. Steve Jobs on touch-enabled laptops : And while Apple points to its own research on this problem, it 's a widely recognized issue that touchscreen researchers have known about for decades. " We 've done tons of user testing on this, " Steve Jobs said in Wednesday 's press conference, " and it turns out it does n't work. Touch surfaces do n't want to be vertical. It gives great demo, but after a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off. " Well what does this mean then? That Microsoft did n't do tons of testing? They do seem to be betting on touch-enabled laptops and monitors after all. <p> I figured there was only one thing to do which was to try this for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand on the trackpad while using my left to make touch motions on the monitor. <p> Wow, Steve Jobs was right, gorilla arm is a real problem. I did n't even last 30 minutes in a reclined position. Having your arm extended to touch a screen results in poor economics. I tried bringing my laptop closer which helped but I still felt a case of tennis elbow coming on. I actually play tennis so I know damn well what is feels like. What really surprised me was how quickly I felt it and how drastically different it is compared to a tablet. Holding a tablet in a recliner leaves my elbows rested and in a much more natural position. <p> My God as if Windows 8 was n't already a disaster in the making. It 's my opinion that Windows 8 is a POS regardless of the whether you can touch the screen but I did n't realize how ergonomically incorrect vertical touch interfaces are. Wow. <p> Given how fucking lousy the interface is in Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that Microsoft is n't doing user testing on anyone but their own employees. Microsoft is being ran like a banana republic and asking the employees what they think of Windows 8 is about the same as asking Cuban citizens if they like Communism on Cuban National Television. WTF do you expect them to say? <p> I saw a Microsoft exec today on a financial show talking about Windows 8 and he sounded like one of Saddam 's commanders before the invasion. Zero expectation of victory but trying to keep a straight face for the cameras to avoid an early execution. Well at least someone there in Redmond has his head screwed on right, too bad he 's not in charge. What a shame. What a damn shame. <p> Freetards are actually CLI/Bash lovers : they like text based, visually poor environments, I think they often have difficulties mentally parsing GUI outputs, that is to say, rich visuals confuse them. <p> This is why they always claimed Windows( *) is a prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing system - if they ca n't find their way to the terminal, they are lost( I 'm speaking from experience with a cured freetard I know, but I admit it 's only an anecdote). <p> Metro is like CLI - it is text based, it has extremely poor visuals( oh I 'm sorry, it 's " simple " and " modern ", mhm) it really allows visual idiots( people with poor visual cognition) to use a GUI more easily. Of course, to everyone else it 's an ugly and strange POS that they would n't want to use if you put a pistol to their head, same as nobody wants to use a Segway, since we can fucking walk by ourselves. <p>( *) By which they meant GUI, because they only knew about UNIX/CLI systems until MS-DOS and later Windows invaded enterprise and universities. <p> The basic RT version( WITHOUT the keyboard!) costs 500$, just as much as the iPad! <p> The keyboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch cover keyboard was an essential component? I have to repeat myself : The crippled bare bones RT version, without keyboard, without the ability to run Win32 and with a lousy selection of apps compared to the IOS and Android costs as much as the iPad! <p> So, it 's $250 iPad with a $70 Logitech keyboard cover( *) with the largest software library on the planet( for mobiles) and largest media ecosystem among all platforms <p> - versus - <p> a $500 tablet with $100 keyboard cover( which requires a table to be useful), no software and a small media library, most of which is going to be available through the browser( i.e. nothing you ca n't get anywhere else and optimised for the mouse, a great advantage, sorry, I meant dis-advantage, a nasty fucking problem, actually). <p> * Which lets you firmly affix the iPad into it - essentially you get a laptop, it 's great for long typing - this info made available for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they do n't want to upset any OEMs by " selling too low ", which proves Microsoft 's decision to enter the PC-making business was a stupid one in the first place. They could have released the Surface as a reference design. And what 's with the 100$ keyboard cover? WTF. <p> Windows 8 will sell only with x86 preinstalls, because there are always people that need to buy a new PC. See how Vista got 25% mostly from preinstalls, aka people that had to buy a new PC. <p> Well if gorilla arm was related to arm strength then it 's going a problem for 99% of Americans. But seriously this is an ergonomic problem and not one of strength or stamina. <p> As for bitterness I would love to be wrong about Windows 8 but after reading about surface pricing the last snowflake in hell was just pissed on. That was the only part of the Windows 8 plan that I considered sane, subsidizing surface to make it price competitive with Android. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it absolutely clear to everyone that he really is batshit crazy. Oh wait maybe it is n't clear to you and any remaining Windows 8 defenders who have to lay their balls on the stove to learn that it really is hot. If I am bitter against anyone it is the league of the deluded that ca n't seem to stomach reality until it is fisted up their assholes. <p>... league of the deluded that ca n't seem to stomach reality until it is fisted up their assholes. <p> They do n't care, they think iOS is made for idiots who will accept anything, even Metro ; the other group, much smaller one IMO, thinks Metro is actually good( what goes on in their crazy heads is beyond me). <p> The idiots who think it 's OK started this whole nonsense with Zune, and those who should have pulled the brakes, simply do n't care, because, supposedly, users have nowhere to go. <p> It 'll be really interesting to watch as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spent a little more time in the gym and less time posting bitter, angry shit on the internet your arm would n't feel it was going to fall off? <p> Mr McSportsman, why do n't you try the Jerkface experiment yourself, aka follow the pointer on the screen with your finger while moving the mouse with your other hand? And try to do this for 2 hours while surfing the net? <p> The only convinient form factor for touch devices, is tablets and smartphones, aka something you can hold as if you were holding a newspaper. When I saw an HP touch desktop at a store( it was like an iMac with a touchscreen and no mouse/keyboard), I though " there is a usability clusterfuck. " <p> This is Microsoft 's plan : The only way to make a Windows 8 computer that is n't too much of pain to use is to make a tablet or tablet-hybrid( with the keyboard being able to be fold 180 degrees, like the screen of the Sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to make x86 tablets, so that they fall into iPad category and " win " in tablets. <p> users have nowhere to go. If there is one thing interesting about the whole Windows 8 thing, is that it is going to test the " 90% of users have nowhere to go except Windows - the x86 version at least " theorem. The iPad is obviously not a primary computer( again no moving files from and to USB, or scanners), so will OS X and Asus Transformer become alternatives to Windows? <p> I 'm already seeing comments from people who want Surface so they can run more software than the iPad. Microsoft seems to be letting everyone assume this.... wtf is that about? Oops forgot to mention that none of your Windows software works with this version of Windows. Is that gon na be a problem bro? <p> I 'm already seeing comments from people who want Surface so they can run more software than the iPad. Microsoft seemsto be letting everyone assume this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that none of your Windows software works with this version of Windows. Is that gon na be a problem bro? <p> Hmm... Then what about the x86 version of the Surface?( and x86 Win8 tablets in general)? If they are priced right( and I am not talking onpy about the Surface, but other tablets too), then people may see value in them. <p> Nothing to guess really, only the cheapest model is " sold out " - this proves the actual value of a " Windows " tablet is really slim even to Metro aficionados - even if they produced ten million of these R e T arded Tablets, it would still mean only a small number has been sold ; as it stands, it 's probably in the hundreds of thousands, considering the protracted Metro campaign, it really is a laughable number. <p> On Microsoft 's Surface page they do n't mention that it only works with RT compatible software. I explained this to my wife who at first thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only works with newer software like Office 2010. She could n't conceive of Microsoft releasing a version of Windows that does n't work with anything. Her words after understanding RT
