The search for these three simple items can keep my focus for an uncommonly long time, similar to the way pots and pans hold the attention of a two-year-old. <p> Eastern Long Island 's diverse beaches -- sandy, muddy or cobbled, ocean, bay or sound -- are fertile grounds for my pursuits. Nature writer Christopher Camuto observes : " We come back to the sea, not just for the beauty but for the strangeness of it -- the uncanny way it takes us in and keeps us out. " For me, this statement rings true in the way that, every now and then, the sea tosses ashore a different item of interest to distract me from my original targets, revealing a brief glimpse of marine life in the waters near the shore. <p> One beachcombing distraction is the attractive shell of the False Angel Wing. With its pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine the live mollusk burrowing in the mud without the fragile shells breaking. Yet, False Angel Wings do burrow in the mud, and the shells do not break. Sticking with the theme, the shells of False Angel Wings are often found intact on the beach, despite their fragile make-up. When both shells are found together and spread open at the hinge, with a little imagination they do seem like the frilled wings of tiny angels. <p> Another distraction is an occasional amber-colored, kidney-shaped object that -- in the hand -- appears to be made of thin plastic. Technically known as a Moon Snail 's operculum, it serves as the trap door protecting the soft snail body from the outside world. It makes perfect sense that an operculum would catch my attention on the beach because it initially looks like one of my search items : a piece of brown beach glass. <p> False Angel Wings and opercula are interesting seaside finds every now and then ; even less frequently I stumble upon truly uncommon discoveries. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inlet to Three Mile Harbor, I picked up the connected shells of a bivalve that I did not recognize at all : light green in color, about 1.5 inches long, oval at one end and elongated at the other, and much longer than wide. Its distinctive appearance made it fairly easy to match in the reference guides. This specimen was the first, last and only File Yoldia I have ever found. Now that I have made its acquaintance, the species intrigues me and I keep a constant lookout for another. If luck is on my side, one of these days I will come across a live one. The Peterson Field Guide to Shells instructs that the File Yoldia " is an active mollusk, living in mud but capable of swimming and leaping to an astonishing height(!) ". What would it be like to see firsthand that strange behavior in a clam? <p> A couple of months ago, on a sandy beach along Shinnecock Bay, I found another uncommon shell. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been looking for -- but not finding -- a shell of this species for quite a few years. Flat, thin, somewhat rectangular, lustrous and pearly, my discovery was the bottom shell of a Gould 's Pandora. This bivalve mollusk lives in mud and sand in shallow waters of bay and ocean, but is generally uncommon throughout its range. Similar to the File Yoldia, I hope sometime to chance upon a live specimen of a Gould 's Pandora and learn more about this species through up-close observation. <p> The edge of the sea can often appear stingy in the way that it holds onto its secrets. But I am amazed at the way that it periodically doles out clues to those who are patient. Who knows what items will be encountered on future beach walks? So I continue to take strolls along the interface of land and water, searching for my reliable treasures of pebble, glass and stone, perhaps to stumble upon additional curious remnants of life in the sea. <p> When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Long Island about the precious natural world, and you 're helping underprivileged kids go to our summer programs. <p> Holiday Open House &; Art Show Dec 1 Group for the East End is kicking off the holiday season with an open house and reception for a new show of paintings by Sag Harbor artist, Anne Seelbach. <p> December Wildlife on Dune Road Dec 2 This morning wildlife search along Dune Road in Hampton Bays should encounter a variety of waterfowl, a handful of shorebirds, perhaps a few birds of prey, and a harbor seal or two. <p> Nature Crafts II : Pine Cone Bird Feeder Dec 8 Make your own bird feeder during our workshop and learn about the different birds you may attract
