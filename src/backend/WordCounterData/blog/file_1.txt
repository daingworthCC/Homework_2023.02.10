5108141 <h> Saturday, 17 November 2012 <p> Emerging from the fog, as it were. I always forget just how all-consuming the first throes of rehearsal for an opera can be. Especially if, as in this case, the lead role is not yet cast( it 's a hellishly difficult sing, and the intended singer pulled out just before musical rehearsals began. He is a consummate professional, so he must have had very solid reasons, but that still leaves other colleagues( luckily not me : the role I am covering is not so big) a bit adrift in a piece which requires long dialogues with the lead...

A question of how your role fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing - the court ladies get to sing some really rather beautiful chords before my character leaps in and spoils it all!) thing is rather marvellous. <h> No comments : <h> Post a Comment <h> About Me <p> I am an English opera singer trying occasionally to make sense of my life in Germany. Random influences from my past include : studying languages( French and Russian) at Cambridge ; drinking far too much vodka with Russians during said " study " ; nearly a year 's busking ; discovering my true voice later than most ; supporting the continuing discovery of my voice with various colourful
