5112341 <h> Sunday, November 4, 2012 <h> This is a post about voting, but you should read it anyway. <p> Politics. <p>. <p>. <p>. <p>. <p> So, you 're still with me, huh? <p> You 're telling me that word is n't sending you running for the hills? That the very mention of it is n't making you want to rip out your eyeballs and shove them in your ears so you do n't have to hear it? <p> Well, you just WAIT. <p> In the next 48 hours your Twitter feed will surely be flooded with a bunch of political " geniuses " ranting about who you should or should n't vote for. Tweet after tweet after TWEET. Then, you can just IMAGINE the colossal number of " I Voted " stickers you will be forced to look at on bloggers making serious kissy faces/that girl you were in choir with in high school/your overly social-media-enthused cousin posted on instagram and facebook. The sheer volume will be sure to throw you into a state of rage, the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Idol( seriously though, WTF America???)!!! <p> It 's gon na be ugly. Real ugly. <p> But still, you should vote. And do it intelligently. Not like I used to do in my high school SBO elections, where I would just do whatever Whitney Donaldson did, cause she was, like, soooo popular, and, like, soooo pretty. Also, do n't do it based on what the TV tells you. I mean, I love TV. She 's my girl. But I know better than to believe everything she tells me. I mean, she told me once I should buy pajama jeans, and I do n't think I need to explain to you how that worked out. <p> So, I say, visit the websites of the candidates sometime today or tomorrow, and take a minute to read what each really stands for, then think about what you really stand for, and then get out there and vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, maybe there will be a waaaaay foxy guy in line with you. And you 'll get to talking. And you 'll be all up on the issues because you read the candidates websites. And he 'll be all, " Wow... she 's more than just a pretty face. " And you 'll go out for hot chocolate after. And you 'll have the best time. And you 'll decide you ca n't live without each other. And you 'll fall madly in love. And you 'll get married on a beach in the Caribbean, and you 'll invite me because I made this all happen. And we will have SO MUCH FUN. <p> So ya, like I was saying, get informed, then get your butt in a voting booth, get your flirt on with guy-in-the-voting-line and get me
