When you do be sure to have a warm de-chlorinated bath ready for him no deeper than up to his chin. Soak him for 20 minutes and prepare a second bath that is also warm as the other bath cools and soak for 15 minutes. Then place him back home. Keep his temp up and his humidity at 80% and he should come out of it. <h> Re : pixie wont come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grif, will try and get that done tommorow morning since its already late here and its almost my other animals bedtime. any suggestions on handling him? he is so aggresive and probably since he has nt eaten in a while im geussing he will want to eat anything he can, more so then he normaly is like. im afriad for when he s full grown so any tips will definately help! <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> so good news is i know where he is and he isnt that far down, bad news is i cant manage to find a way to get him out. whenever i try to move his plant to get to him so i can grab him he starts hissing and if i brush away the dirt overtop of him he hisses at me to. he is such an aggresive frog im scared he will bite me and he s probably scared im going to hurt him. should i just man up and quickly grab him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> Originally Posted by mafoo <p> so good news is i know where he is and he isnt that far down, bad news is i cant manage to find a way to get him out. whenever i try to move his plant to get to him so i can grab him he starts hissing and if i brush away the dirt overtop of him he hisses at me to. he is such an aggresive frog im scared he will bite me and he s probably scared im going to hurt him. should i just man up and quickly grab him while he hisses or would that be a bad idea? <p> You always want to avoid their face. Go at him from behind and be gentle yet firm so he does n't break loose from your grip. When dealing with large aggressive frogs there is always a chance you could get bit. Try your best to avoid it by avoiding the frogs face. Be careful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine. Do be quick because the less time you 're handling him the less chance he has to bite you. <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> major problem here i think, i got him out of his tank and he was ready to eat so i offered a night crawler but instead he decided to go poop. after he finished i noticed a red thing sticking out! ive read about prolapses and that kind of thing but this is just freaky... i thought he was having a bloody poop but its not coming out and its just sticking out, really worried, rest of his poop was fine but the red thing isnt going back in/coming out so i do nt know whats going on with him. no clue what to do now <p> edit : right as i finished writing this post it went back in. is this normal??? <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> Originally Posted by mafoo <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tank and he was ready to eat so i offered a night crawler but instead he decided to go poop. after he finished i noticed a red thing sticking out! ive read about prolapses and that kind of thing but this is just freaky... i thought he was having a bloody poop but its not coming out and its just sticking out, really worried, rest of his poop was fine but the red thing isnt going back in/coming out so i do nt know whats going on with him. no clue what to do now <p> edit : right as i finished writing this post it went back in. is this normal??? <p> No it is n't normal. It is good that the prolapse went back in, but it may be swelled slightly. Prepare another bath of luke warm de-chlorinated water and dialogs 4 to 5 drops of honey in and then soak your frog for 20 minutes. Pour some of the Honey/water solution over his back too. After the 20 minutes are up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-chlorinated water and place him back in the enclosure in his dish and leave him be. Keep his temps at 80 F and humidity at 80%. Keep a close eye on him for a few days. <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> will get all that done today. i normaly feed him nightcrawlers and occasionly throw some crickets in his tank if he does nt eat much that day so he can munch on them throughout the day. i feed him every day and he normaly eats 4-6 nightcrawlers. he has nt eaten in the days he was buried though so this was probably from the day before he started hiding which he did nt eat much, only around 2 nightcrawlers because he was having a bit of problems getting them in his mouth to actualy eat so he just stopped after fighting with the second one. <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> Originally Posted by mafoo <p> will get all that done today. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his tank if he does nt eat much that day so he can munch on them throughout the day. i feed him every day and he normaly eats 4-6 nightcrawlers. he has nt eaten in the days he was buried though so this was probably from the day before he started hiding which he did nt eat much, only around 2 nightcrawlers because he was having a bit of problems getting them in his mouth to actualy eat so he just stopped after fighting with the second one. <p> Do you dust his food with Calcium with D3 and a Multivitamin with Vitamin A? <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> every couple feedings i dust it with repashy calcium plus but now after a bit of reading on this forum im thinking ill use the repashy calcium plus once every 3-4 days and straight calcium every 1 or two feedings just so i do nt overdose on the multivitamin. <p> right now my frog is inside his tank after i cleaned it all up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he always does. he is very active after the bath and was swimming around in the little bit of water that was inside there and just finished exploring his tank. thanks for all the help! do nt know what i would have done without you! <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> Originally Posted by mafoo <p> every couple feedings i dust it with repashy calcium plus but now after a bit of reading on this forum im thinking ill use the repashy calcium plus once every 3-4 days and straight calcium every 1 or two feedings just so i do nt overdose on the multivitamin. <p> right now my frog is inside his tank after i cleaned it all up and he s just digging a new hole to hide in like he always does. he is very active after the bath and was swimming around in the little bit of water that was inside there and just finished exploring his tank. thanks for all the help! do nt know what i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome and I 'm glad I could help. Keep his climate consistent with very little fluctuation and he should n't try and aestivate anymore. Occasionally they will burrow all the way, but usually come back out after a day or so. He should be ok now. Keep an eye on his bowel movements and if he has another prolapse perform the honey bath as I instructed and depending on how bad it is ask for advise if worse than this one. <h> Re : pixie wont come out of his burrow he is hiding in <p> alright ill keep an eye on things and now i will keep a extra bulb for when the other one goes out to avoid this situation.i will be back if the prolapse comes
