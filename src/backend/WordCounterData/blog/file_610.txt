5169441 <p> The nation 's debt clock is ticking faster than ever -- and Wall Street is getting worried. <p> As the Obama administration racks up an unprecedented spending bill for bank bailouts, Detroit rescues, health care overhauls and stimulus plans, the bond market is starting to push up the cost of trillions of dollars in borrowing for the government. <p> Last week, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to its highest level since November, briefly touching 3.17 percent, a sign that investors are demanding larger returns on the masses of United States debt being issued to finance an economic recovery. <p> While that is still low by historical standards -- it averaged about 5.7 percent in the late 1990s, as deficits turned to surpluses under President Bill Clinton -- investors are starting to wonder whether the United States is headed for a new era of rising market interest rates as the government borrows, borrows and borrows some more. <p> Already, in the first six months of this fiscal year, the federal deficit is running at $956.8 billion, or nearly one seventh of gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, according to Wrightson ICAP, a research firm. <p> Debt held by the public is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to rise from 41 percent of gross domestic product in 2008 to 51 percent in 2009 and to a peak of around 54 percent in 2011 before declining again in the following years. For all of 2009, the administration probably needs to borrow about $2 trillion. <p> The rising tab has prompted warnings from the Treasury that the Congressionally mandated debt ceiling of $12.1 trillion will most likely be breached in the second half of this year. <p> Last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of industry officials that advises the Treasury on its financing needs, warned about the consequences of higher deficits at a time when tax revenues were " collapsing " by 14 percent in the first half of the fiscal year. <p> " Given the outlook for the economy, the cost of restoring a smoothly functioning financial system and the pending entitlement obligations to retiring baby boomers, " a report from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly increasing debt in the years ahead. " <p> While the real long-term interest rate will not rise immediately, the committee concluded, " such a fiscal path could force real rates notably higher at some point in the future. " <p> Alas, this is just the beginning. Three quarters of the spending in the misnamed stimulus bill( it would more accurately be called the " Pork and Social Spending We 've Been Waiting Years to Foist on the Unsuspecting Public Bill ") occurs next year and beyond, when most economists expect the economy to be growing again. Moreover, much of the so-called stimulus outlays do nothing to actually stimulate the economy, being used for income transfers and the usual social programs. <p> However, we will be paying for these outlays for years. Even as, the Congressional Budget Office warns, the GDP ultimately shrinks as federal expenditures and borrowing " crowd out " private investment. Indeed, the CBO figures that incomes will suffer a permanent decline -- even as taxes are climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sam. <p> And you do n't want to think about the total bill as Washington bails out( almost $13 trillion worth so far) everyone within reach, " stimulates "( the bill passed earlier this year ran $787 billion) everything within reach, and spends money( Congress approved a budget of $3.5 trillion for next year) within reach. Indeed, according to CBO, the president 's budget envisions increasing the additional collective federal deficit between 2010 and 2019 from $4.4 trillion to $9.3 trillion.) Then there will be more federal spending for wastral government entities, such as the Federal Housing Administration ; failing banks, which are being closed at a record rate by the FDIC ; pension pay-offs for bankrupt companies, administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ; and covering the big tab being up run up by Social Security and Medicare, which currently sport unfunded liabilities of around $100 trillion. <p> Oh, to be an American taxpayer -- and especially a young American taxpayer -- who will be paying Uncle @ @
