5204641 <h> Single Celebrities We Want to See Hitched <p> Whether single by choice or by broken heart, the prospect of marriage for the unattached seems distantly hypothetical. If you 're a free spirit looking for flings, fun and flirting, you 'll avoid even the thought of it at all costs. For those recovering from a lost love, it 's important not to give up, because Prince Charming will come again. In fact, there are some Hollywood bachelors and bachelorettes who are in desperate need of true love as well. Others are devoted to such a carefree life of casual hookups that it makes one wonder if even the most glamorous single celebrity could lock them down. Here are the stars we 'd like to push down the aisle : <p> 1.

" One of my vices is, I 'm too wrapped up in myself and not always in a good way. " That said, as of last spring, Butler has been seen with Madalina Ghenea, a Romanian model who helped him promote a brand of razors. Is the rowdy Scott breaking his old habits? <p> 4. Katie Holmes : Not that the young actress has to start rehearsing her dating scene so soon after her summer divorce, but Katie Holmes still has plenty of time for future love, and even marriage.
