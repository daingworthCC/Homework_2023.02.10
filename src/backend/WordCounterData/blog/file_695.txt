I think we 're going to end up with a 7 - 3 record with a loss to HU, HSU and SAU, but I do n't think we 'll get manhandled by anyone except arguably HU. I was n't at the game since I 'm an alumn who lives fairly far from Arkansas but I heard we had some referee trouble and an identity crisis trying a dual QB system. I think we can pull it together enough to look competitive against SAU. <p> And as for the Battle of the Ravine, I 've never seen a blowout at that game, at least not in football. I have however seen OBU on ESPN Top 10 from ridiculous plays. Its my favorite game of the year because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better than the other. The real oddity about it right now is how the overall series is n't at a deadlock.500, Henderson has a very slight lead alltime <p> If we somehow pull off the upsets and win out we might eek in but I would n't count on it because the math seems pretty against any GAC team that does n't win every game <h> Re : With the loss to HU, is OBU done in terms of playoff contention? <p> Originally Posted by Divisiontwo <p> It 's not true. HU, if they win out, will be in. They played a decent out of conference game.

I wish that we would go to 11 games, and have 1 tough OOC game each year. Going forward we will have to have that because the 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOS, and will make it tougher to qualify for the PO 's. There are a lot of conferences that have an 11 game schedule now. <h> Re : With the loss to HU, is OBU done in terms of playoff contention? <p> OBU made not be in contention now. Come BOTR game is at a different level. OBU is not gon na lay down because of there record. Matter of fact throw out
