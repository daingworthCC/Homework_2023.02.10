5170041 <p> Russell is really mad at me right now. And for a reason that annoys the stuff out of me. For a reason that for the last few years has been popping up almost every day. That reason is my supposed mental disorders, whether that be OCD, ADD, or Social Anxiety Disorder. I 'm not going to lie, I can be totally screwed up sometimes with what my mind does, but not nearly as much or as badly as people think. It seems that every single day, I get some comment from somebody about how I 'm always so afraid to do something or how I 'm always so clean or how I 'm always this or always that. All of these always 's and presumptions and bringing back things I 've said in the past to punch me in the face are really starting to piss me off. <p> The reason Russell is mad at me is because I told him that I did not want to hang out at his friend John 's house yesterday. He called. He was all, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at John 's house? " Then I was all, " No, not really. " Then Russell was all, " Why not? " Then I was all, " Well, I just do n't feel like it. " Then Russell was all, " But WHY do n't you feel like it? Give me a reason. Give me one good reason. " So then I was all, " umm.... What do you mean give you a reason? I just do n't really feel like going. " Russell was like, " What? Are you scared again? You 're always so scared of hanging out with people. I thought you liked John. Why wo n't you hang out with people? You hung out with some of my friends the other day and you were fine with it. Why ca n't you hang out with John now? " So, then, I 'm like, " Well, I really just do n't feel like it today. I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up. <p> I chatted with Russell online today and apparently, he 's still mad at me. Is it so much to ask that I can make a simple decision and not be pestered with a thousand questions about why I 'm doing it? Why do I NEED to have a legitimate reason as to why I do n't want to do something. I simply DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT. Just like I do n't really feel like eating ice cream right now. -- Oh my gosh. Do I? Do I have ICE CREAM PHOBIA?! Hurry up and pour a vat of ice cream down my throat so I can be exposed to it and learn how much I really love ice cream! HURRY! <p> That 's another problem with people. As soon as they learn that I might feel uncomfortable about something, for example : social situations, they automatically feel that I should be exposed to them in order to make me feel better. Not that I want to emphasize the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you ca n't just expect something to go away by simply exposing somebody to something. That 's like saying that throwing an obsessive compulsive clean-freak into a pile of hospital sheets marked " Bio-Hazzard " will make them get over all of his issues. It just DOES N'T WORK THAT WAY. <p> But that 's not what this post is supposed to be complaining about. This post is complaining about how people take things that I say way too seriously and use what I have said against me. I hate that. I hate when people quote me. What makes people think that the way I feel one day is the way I 'm going to be feeling one day or the next? <p> I remember a few years ago, when I was seeing a therapist for my obsessive compulsiveness. When I went to see this therapist, we would often get into pointless, hour-long discussions and arguments about how I act and how I really feel about things and when I would try to say something, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well, you did n't feel that way two weeks ago! " I felt sort of betrayed. You 're supposed to feel comfortable around a therapist, not like your every word is going to be used against you. <p> While I do admit that I do have some mental issues, I really do n't want people bringing them up for every aspect of my life. I do n't go to some people 's houses for the very good reason of JUST BECAUSE. Not because I 'm terrified of talking to people, not because if I leave the safety of my bedroom I will catch SARS. JUST BECAUSE! I still want to use my mental disorders as an excuse for my sometimes bizarre behavior, but please, please, PLEASE, do n't use them against me. <p> EDIT : It turns out that Russell was kidding about the whole thing and just forgot to tell me. Hmph. <h> 3 Comments <p> &; I know what thats like, I get in those wanting to be alone lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm being a downer and depressed. whats wrong with liking PJs and watching tv by yourself? <p> nothing, thats what! in fact people should do it more. <p> by the way, that thing I said the other day, that was mostly my loneliness and
