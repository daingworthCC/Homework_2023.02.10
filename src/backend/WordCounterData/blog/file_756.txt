5184241 <h> Three Simple Words <p> Nov 17, 2012 <p> It 's amaz-ing the amount of power words have when you really think about it. I 'm sure we can all remem-ber a moment when an unkind word was said to us on the play-ground, or whis-pers in the hall in school. I know I can. Sadly, it 's dur-ing those years that we really do n't know the power those words spo-ken have on a per-son. It 's so easy to remem-ber the neg-a-tive as I guess those are the ones that impact us and hurt us the most. The neg-a-tive words are the first ones which creep up on us instead of the kind, they are the ones that I and I 'm sure you, always have to push back down. <p> So today, my wish is that we all give hope, courage and love to a stranger, a friend in need or some-one who looks like they really need to know there is hope, needs just a lit-tle bit of encour-age-ment or lots of love. It 's sim-ple to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak. Hope-fully, these will be the words that rise to the top and they will real-ize they can con-quer any hur-dle no mat-ter how high that is placed in front of them. I have a few friends that have some seri-ously high hur-dles to con-quer at the moment and I plan on empow-er-ing them with " Hope, Courage and Love. " <p> I will post a tuto-r-ial on how I made this charm, next week. This week-end, is all about " Hope, Courage and Love. " <h> Tags <h> Share This <p> Oh Lisa I was hop-ing you would do a tuto-r-ial for this. IT 's absolutely beau-ti-ful! Thank you for shar-ing and for those won-der-ful words of inspi-ra-tion. I was small and " homely " look-ing back in school and was picked on a lot! By high school I seemed to fill out and blos-somed which of course brought out my personality... the strong one! I learned to over-come all the hor-ri-ble things that had hap-pened to me in my younger years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell that they would find peace in their own lives. For I real-ized it was they who were the mis-er-able ones... and you know what they say... misery loves company! <p> Beth W <p> Can-not wait for the tutorial.I have a dear friend bat-tling breast cancer-this is going to be her Christ-mas present.Thank you Lisa! <p> Sushicue <p> This is just beau-ti-ful! I 'm anx-iously look-ing for-ward to your tuto-r-ial, as well. My nephew is cur-rently strug-gling with gruel obsta-cles in his young life and I 'd like to make one for him... just a tad bit " man-i-fied " up. You 're very insightful! <p> Linda Tal-ley <p> This is so beau-ti-ful and with my mom going through ovar-ian can-cer right it will be a per-fect bond-ing
