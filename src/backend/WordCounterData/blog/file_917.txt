5200641 <h> a long time <p> Hi friends! It 's been a long time( over a month!) since I 've posted anything on here, and I feel terrible about it. I started back at school and suddenly my schedule is full and all of my outfits have to be bicycle-appropriate. I would n't trade any of it though, even if it means I have less time to spend on the blog. Today is my 25th birthday, and for the first time in years I feel like I 'm headed in the right direction. I hope to have more time to blog( once my camera is repaired!) in the coming weeks. It 's a fun creative outlet and I have met so many great, supportive people through blogging. So thank you, all of you who are
