5138341 <p> As we all now ' The Hunger Games : Catching Fire ' is starting its production. And much like in the first movie we all know, whether or not we accept it, that things must get cut out for the sake of time. SPOILER ALERT : In case you have n't read ' Catching Fire ', there will be some mild spoilers below, so beware! <p> According to a source in touch with The Hob fan site, the rumor is that Bonnie, one of the characters Katniss encounters in the woods outside of District 12, will be sacrificed from the film. If you do n't remember, Twill and Bonnie are two runaways that tell Katniss more of the uprisings in other districts, and most importantly, about the perseverance of District 13. There is no word on whether Twill will make an appearance or not. <p> This is of course just a rumor, and I doubt we will hear a definite answer on the issue until at least the end of production, so remember to take this news with a grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence of both Bonnie and Madge in the movies makes me wonder how the idea of District 13 will be brought into the story. <p> Is there another way you think Katniss will be introduced to District 13 and the Rebellion in the movies? Tell us in the comments below! <p> Why have Twill and not Bonnie? Why ca n't they cast both? They 're both quite important -- since that 's when Katniss first hears about the possibility of District 13? s secret plotting to overthrow the Capitol. <p> Maybe she could hear all the news in the governor 's building, but I do n't know how she 'll get in now that Madge is n't there.. but I 'm thinking it 's possible for that to be the mystery? But I 'm sure they 'll think of something creative I mean, we all saw THG so we know they have some great creative juices to work with! <p> They prob want a lead up. She might see the screen of another rebellion plus president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her rebellion comment and then her shooting he force field and district 12 demolition could give a hint so that everyone starts thinking but cant be sure till the next movie? <p> Well, if they took out Bonnie and Twill how would they show Katniss knowing about D13? And also, I think there was the importance of the part where Katniss saw the uprising on Madge 's dad 's tv. And she tells Gale and( I havent read them in a while) and I believe they want to leave D12. <p> And if they do nt have Madge then Katniss wont see the tv. <p> If they do nt have Bonnie or Twill, Katniss wont know there might be D13. <p> But also as " Charisma " says that they could do that and Katniss has no suspicions that there is a D13 and she does nt find out till the end of the 2nd movie. <p> And there are rumors the the " mystery character " which I think is either Madge, Annie, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I think she was really important in the second book because she is the reason Katniss saw the tv AND because she gives Gale the painkillers and practically saves his life. <p> It is stupid how they are taking out Bonnie and Twill as they were the ones that had a hunch District 13 still existed, they are major parts in this story because without them, non of the tributes would have escaped the arena. Another character has to tell Katniss about District 13 and I think it should be Gale, he has always been repulsed by the Capitol and completely hates them so him questioning the existence of District 13 would be perfect. <p> Its a short scene, and you cant just suddenly shove in a whole new concept to the plot line, you need some backstory, somthing at the beggining to start to off... like pieces of the puzzle for people who are watching, to slowly piece together as the story goes. Its only a little bit more money, and you could reuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt want too many more changes and I 'm still annoyed that they did n't put madge in... Soooooo yah...
