5139341 <p> Kabam, a San Francisco game maker, is publishing two games inspired by the upcoming release of Peter Jackson 's " The Hobbit " movie trilogy -- and better yet, both will be free. <p> Under the deal, Kabam will develop and operate The Hobbit : Kingdoms of Middle-earth for mobile, and The Hobbit : Armies of the Third Age for the Web. The games are expected to come out this fall, ahead of the first movie -- " An Unexpected Journey " -- on Dec. 14. <p> The deal is a big win for Kabam, which has been working hard over the past year to diversify beyond the Facebook platform. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment is co-publishing the two titles. <p> In an interview, Kevin Chou, Kabam 's CEO, emphasized that this is not a traditional licensing deal, where Kabam agrees to pay a huge upfront fee for the games ' rights and then bears all of the risk.

Both games will be monetized through virtual goods. <p> Kabam is known for creating " mid-core " games, meaning that they require more involvement by the players than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with the movies, which are dark and gritty. The mobile game will have an empire-building component seen in previous Kabam games, and the Web game will have real-time combat sequences, he said. <p> This is not Kabam 's first licensing deal. It worked previously on The Godfather : Five Families, a big-budget social game for Facebook. While it may not have gone as well as some may have hoped -- and was possibly hurt by the fact that " The Godfather " series had no new films coming out -- it may have helped establish Kabam 's ability to work content creators. In the case of " The Godfather, " it was Paramount Digital Entertainment. <p> Free is probably the right call for the games, even if Tolkien fans are willing to flock to theaters and pay to watch the movie on the big screen.
