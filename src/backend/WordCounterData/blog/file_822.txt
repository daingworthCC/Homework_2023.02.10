5191041 <h> I Was the First to Go to College <p> " She will never graduate high school! What makes you think she will step foot into a university? " I 've heard these words since I was a junior in high school from my family. I 'm now in my last year of college. These words have been my motivation to get here. I was the first in my family to be born in the United States and the first to ever attend a university. <p> My mother and father were born in 1943 and I was born in 1988. Their generation is very different from mine. They were born and raised in Mexico and during this time their lives were completely different than the life I know. Their cultural and religious beliefs were and still are very conservative. They hold onto traditional views that a woman should serve the man, a woman should stay home, the man is the man of the house, el de los pantalones( the man wears the pants in the house) and the man has the voice. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wipes the dirty behinds of all seven kids she gave birth to. <p> I was born into this family, but unfortunately in a different generation. I was born in a generation that does not understand these ways nor do they understand ours. " Who do you think you are staying at the library till 3 am? Quien cres que eres navegando las calles tan tarde "( Who do you think you are staying out in the streets so late?). " No se mama, perdona me, " all I can do is ask for forgiveness when my mom questions why I spend all my time outside of the house studying, working and getting involved in my community. I thought that they would be proud of me, but why are they so angry? They do n't seem to understand that as a college student I need to stay late with study groups and studying in the library. I work, I go to school and I 'm responsible! Why ca n't I stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library studying until they close? This has made it difficult for me to adapt to the " America " awaiting me every time I step out of my house. Even if the border crossed us, yo todavia vivo en Mexico( I still live in Mexico). It has been a struggle to work my way through college without much support from my family. I honestly do not know if graduate school will be a possibility for me. My parents are nearly 70 years old and my heart wo n't be able to handle the guilt if I turn my back and leave. There is a positive outcome from this though ; I have paved a trail for my nieces and nephews to follow. <p> College has been one of my greatest accomplishments. It has given me that rush and that drive to keep going. Most importantly, I have found a different me. This seed in me was lacking water, lacking the passion to grow and thirsty for something I did not know -- EDUCATION! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the soil that is allowing my seed to grow into a humongous tree. I have yet to find myself in this world, but education has been my door to a billion possibilities. A world I did not know of, and I want others to find. My goal is to help those who are lost like I was. I want to help show them that an individual with passion is capable of accomplishing anything their heart desires. Accomplishments are n't accomplishments if one does n't extend that helping hand to someone else. <h> Comments <p> You are a very inspiring girl Saray, and I 'm glad that the Latinitas have such a great role model to look up to! Do n't rule out graduate school just yet, because though they might have good intentions, parents do n't always understand your dreams and what you need to do to be proud of the life your living. I 'm very glad I 've gotten to know you this semester! <h> Connect with Us <h> HOLIDAY SHOPPING BENEFITTING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows you to donate a small percentage of the cost of your online purchases to any non-profit organization - we would LOVE to be that organization!
