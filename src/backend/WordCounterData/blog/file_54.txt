5113441 <h> I 've Got A Unique Gift For Long Time Readers <p> Hi folks, this is John Robb. As you know, I 'm a pragmatic, optimist. What does that mean? <p> While I hope we wo n't see another Frankenstorm like Sandy, I bet we will soon. <p> I also hope we do n't see another financial meltdown, where people lost a third of their wealth, but all indications are that we will soon. <p> Finally, I keep hoping that the political process will start to address the issue, but there 's no sign of that. It just keeps getting more surreal as we keep getting poorer. <p> If these problems were just TV programs, I would just turn them off. But I ca n't, and you ca n't. The way we live our lives today, these dysfunctional systems are in control of our futures, and their problems will become our problems. <p> However, I 'm not willing to let these systems dictate our collective future. I strongly believe we should aspire to something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local community. <p> But how? <p> I 've got the answer.

I like the resilience concept and I believe what you 're already doing is important, but it has been frustrating to see all these great ideas and not have the resources to implement them. We need options for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to get worse in the future, I wo n't be the only one who needs them. <p> This is great! My wife recently started reading Resilient Communities and she is VERY excited about what she is learning. We ca n't wait to implement resilient strategies into our first resilient community, our family. <p> Hi again, John. The problem is bigger than I thought : it seems I 've suscribed twice, becaused there was a problem with the direct payment and I remade it with paypal. So, payed twice and no email to confirm suscription. I 'd appreciatte you get in contact with me as soon as possible. Thanks. <p> Thanks so much for joining. Did you check your spam folder? A half dozen folks had that problem. The e-mail should have been sent almost immediately. Would resend it, but I 'm
