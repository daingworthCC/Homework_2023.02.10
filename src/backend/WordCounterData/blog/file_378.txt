5146041 <h> Friday, October 05, 2012 <h> " As soon as a coin in the coffer rings / the soul from purgatory springs " <p> Thank you, John Tetzel. <p> John Tetzel was a Dominican monk who in the 16th century was selling indulgences. Shame on him. Martin Luther did not like him and condemned him for such( specifically, #27 of Luther 's 95 Theses). <p> Bp. Fulton Sheen once said, " There are not more than 100 people in the world who truly hate the Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they perceive to be the Catholic Church..... As a matter of fact, if we Catholics believed all of the untruths and lies which were said against the Church, we probably would hate the Church a thousand times more than they do. " That certainly holds for plenary indulgences. <p> The indulgence, valid from the opening of the Year on 11 October 2012 until its end on 24 November 2013, is for the " temporal punishment of sins, imparted by the mercy of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As with every Plenary Indulgence, it may be obtained " by all faithful who, truly penitent, take Sacramental Confession and the Eucharist and pray in accordance with the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff. " <p> " Each time they the faithful attend at least three sermons during the Holy Missions, or at least three lessons on the Acts of the Council or the articles of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, in church or any other suitable location. Each time they visit, in the course of a pilgrimage, a papal basilica, a Christian catacomb, a cathedral church or a holy site designated by the local ordinary for the Year of Faith( for example, minor basilicas and shrines dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Apostles or patron saints), and there participate in a sacred celebration, or at least remain for a congruous period of time in prayer and pious meditation, concluding with the recitation of the Our Father, the Profession of Faith in any legitimate form, and invocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances, to the Holy Apostles and patron saints. Each time that, on the days designated by the local ordinary for the Year of Faith,... in any sacred place, they participate in a solemn celebration of the Eucharist or the Liturgy of the Hours, adding thereto the Profession of Faith in any legitimate form. On any day they choose, during the Year of Faith, if they make a pious visit to the baptistery, or other place in which they received the Sacrament of Baptism, and there renew their baptismal promises in any legitimate form. " <p> Okay, as I speak, Lutherans are frothing at the mouth, screaming, " Scheming Papists! " But let me simplify this for you, if I may. <p> Let 's start with 2 Maccabees. What 's that, it 's not in your Bible? Well, no... Luther did not like it so he took it out. The Church holds that it is the Scriptual basis for Purgatory. But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins. " -- 2 Macabees 12:46 <p> Rather than say, " No, it is n't about Purgatory! " Luther decided... to just get rid of it. <p> Hmmmm... <p> Let 's also use some common sense. There is no sin in heaven, right? There ca n't be and still be Heaven! And you, you are not in any sinless state right now, are you? Such that if you die and warrant Heaven, your soul will have to undergo a cleansing, a purgation, if you will. What is that process? <p> It 's Purgatory. <p> How long will any one person be in Purgatory? <p> Only God knows. <p> And... when a Catholic confesses their sins, they are absolved from the sin. BUT - that does NOT mean that they suffer no consequences. Because that would be stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry and confess them, that you get away scot free, right? I mean, that 's why they call it Penance, honey. So you have some scrubbing to do in Purgatory before you can enter into Paradise from all your past badness. <p> And that is where a plenary indulgence comes in. It is a way of working off a tad of that time in Purgatory. It is not a " get-out-of-jail-for-free " card in the Monopoly game of life. We can claim it for ourselves, we can offer it for a soul in Purgatory. But it requires a little more effort than simply kneeling down by the side of our bed and saying a quick prayer. <p> How much will you knock off? A nanosecond? A millenium? <p> Only God knows. <p> But then - maybe a nanosecond was all it would take in His great mercy to get you out of Purgatory and up to Heaven. <p> The Year of Faith starts October 11th. I think it is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons on " the articles of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. " You know what would help with that? Reading it! And boy, are you in luck! <p> For this Year of Faith, Pope Benedict has encouraged you to study and reflect on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Well, here 's an easy way to do it. Simply enter your email address and - starting October 11, 2012 - you 'll start getting a little bit of the Catechism emailed to you every morning. Read that little bit every day and you 'll read the whole catechism in a year. Cool, right? <p> Way cool. Simply sign up and over the course of the year, you will get a daily dose of catechism.
