5194741 <h> Enough of What We Think, What Do You Think? <p> In what 's shaping up as the playoffs before the playoffs, all but five teams( LA, Tampa Bay, Toronto, Edmonton, Chicago) are still in the hunt. <p> In the East, I see it finishing like this : <p> Montreal Philadelphia Washington as division leaders, with the rest being : <p> Ottawa Pittsburgh New Jersey Rangers Boston <p> Montreal will pass a battered Ottawa Senators. Daniel Alfredsson, who was playing phenomenal hockey and had surged into the scoring lead briefly, has been bothered by a hip flexor and the Senators will not rush him back. Dany Heatley has been out with a separated shoulder. Their goaltending tandem of Martin Gerber and Ray Emery has been the source of much drama as Emery has not taken well to a secondary role. Meanwhile, Cristobal Huet has been quietly sensational in goal for Montreal. His save percentage is.924 and his goals against 2.30. The Canadiens have become balanced and are ready to capitalize on the Senators ' misfortune. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in the after-party. Alex Ovechkin looks like the player Alex Kovalev could have been at age 22. Powerful and skilled, Ovechkin could take the Capitals on a good run all by himself, but his supporting cast is rounding into shape. Nicklas Backstrom is every bit the threat that the scouts insisted he was, Alexander Semin is finally healthy and Mike Green has become a sharpshooter from the blueline. These Caps are going places. <p> In the West, it 's : Detroit San Jose Calgary as division leaders, followed by : <p> Anaheim Minnesota Dallas Phoenix Columbus <p> San Jose will claim the Pacific Division behind Evgeni Nabokov and Joe Thornton, who has a healthy Jonathan Cheechoo back on his wing and firing true. The acquisition of tough Jody Shelley should not be underestimated. In Calgary, Miikka Kiprusoff is finally rounding into shape and Jarome Iginla will show he is MVP worthy. Both teams will be busy at the trade deadline. The Sharks need a shake, and Doug Wilson, who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the top. Calgary needs to figure out a way to re-sign Kristian Huselius, Daymond Langkow and, most importantly, Dion Phanuef. The answer, most likely, will be to offload Alex Tanguay. Darryl Sutter will land some extra grit. <p> Phoenix and Columbus, with formidable goaltending in Ilya Bryzgalov( Phoenix) and Pascal Leclaire( Columbus), high-energy attacks and strong coaching are the best of the rest. Roberto Luongo has not been able to cover for a banged-up Vancouver defense. <p> Now, it 's your turn. Tell us what you think. Leave a comment with your order of finish. <p> *Senators -- they are good *Devils -- Sutter for Adams *Canes -- if Cullen recovers, they are too fast and have better goaltending than Washington Flyers -- if they do n't get any more suspensions Habs -- Hooooooooo-et Rangers -- Man do I hope and pray Pens -- miss Cindy Crosby Sabres -- do n't count out Ryan Miller and Lindy Ruff I love Ovie but I do n't think their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Boston, they have overachieved thus far but sooner or later it will fall down. -- -- -- *Wings -- they are really good *Sharks -- young and dangerous *Wild -- solid Aves -- Sakic will be back soon Stars -- Lehtinen is back and their d very good Flames -- Kennan, ' nuff said Coyotes -- Bryzgalov is underrated Ducks -- Niedermayer will get them in by the skin of their teeth I think Hitch is an awesome coach but without more talent, the Jackets just are n't a playoff team. <p> EAST : 1. Philadelphia -- They have an easy schedule going forward- if they stay out of trouble. Their power play is awesome. 2. Montreal -- for the reasons you stated. 3. Washington -- probably the toughest call, I think Carolina and Atlanta still have a chance- there is a lot of inter-divisional play left for these teams. Ovechkin is just carrying the team on his back. 4. Ottawa -- It 's going to be a battle between Montreal and Ottawa if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will overtake the Flyers but with combination of Broduer and Parise they are always a team to watch. 6. Pens -- Can they hold on without Sid? Will be interesting to see if they make any trades. 7. Bruins -- Thanks to Thomas they are in. 8. Rangers -- The Rangers are too inconsistent, they will be fighting to hold on to this spot -- A number of teams could take it but Lundqvist will get them in. <p> WEST : 1. Red Wings -- Well there 's no doubt they 'll end up here, but will that translate into playoff success? 2. Flames -- Iginla is a man on fire right now. Serious Hart trophy candidate. One of the most underrated players in the league. 3. Sharks -- Have 5 games at hand on the Stars. 4. Stars -- Marty Turco has been playing great- Zubov is underrated due to playing in the shadow of Nick Lidstrom... 5. Ducks -- They are sliding right now... can they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Predators -- If they sign Petr Forsberg... definitely. 8. Coyotes or Avalanche -- Rick Nash is nasty so I would love to see the Blue Jackets make it... but, I do n't think it is going to happen this year. Statsny and Sakic make the Avs dangerous but Bryzgalov could play the
