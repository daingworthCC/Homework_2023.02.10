5159041 <p> An immediacy of regret ricocheted off of every hard surface in the house last week after we accidently clicked " publish " instead of " preview " for the eggplant stack post. An( extremely) rough draft of bubbling thoughts suddenly live, sent to 3000+ inboxes around the world. My heart sank. I wanted to chase after every visitor and beg, " Hey, wait! That 's not what I meant to say! " After reading your kind comments and emails I felt the need to briefly clarify, for my own sake, that I have no desire to leave this space. I have dedicated so much of my soul and time to this adventure with the explicit purpose of reaching, teaching, learning, and growing into the world. Growing into myself. Sharing stories and semblances of a journey to honor the one we each take, individually, every day and the one we share together as human beings. My " lingering concern, " as I so phrased it, about what Happyolks provides is more a matter of how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility, this vessel, and infuse it with more light, deeper purpose, and greater authenticity. That is my work. And, I will very much keep working. <p> But, let 's move on. What I really want to talk about today is Mudita. Have you heard the term before? Mudita is sanskrit for the Buddhist vision of joy, more specifically sympathetic joy. Sympathetic joy, or appreciative joy as it 's also translated, is the pleasure and happiness experienced in delighting in other people 's well-being and good fortune. When you genuinely feel gladness for anothers success, the cultivated energy will uplift your own spirit and change the way you live and experience the world. My levels of sympathetic joy have been through the freaking roof lately. Friends and family are starting careers, opening new chapters, changing course, tackling big projects, getting married, having children. My heart feels so swollen with love and eagerness for these folks. The Mudita, sympathetic joy, I have cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in more ways than I could possibly describe. <p> Within this beautiful mess of joy, The Sprouted Kitchen Cookbook. The culmination of years of hard work and soul-stretching has brought the world another beautiful artifact of love and passion. I am inspired. I am captivated. I am overwhelmed with happiness for this enormous success. You did it, Sara and Hugh. You really did it. Here 's our gathering, a gathering you both helped make. It is one instance, one night, where the world became a little better because of your grace and dedication. Congratulations, friends. Enjoy the ride! Recipes from film : <p> It 's funny, because we just had a small gathering like that a few days ago. Good friends, good food, and a lot of joy. If this cookbook brings more good times like that, it should be on my bookshelf. ;) Gorgeous video... miss you, lady! <p> I love your kind words, and the happiness spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally relate,, and you brought me this word I have never heard of, and I am grateful for that. I feel so happy for this cookbook, and I am so excited to learn from it, cook from it, and be inspired. <p> Lovely post, and always, there is that bit of teaching, a gentle push towards something better. I love that about you. Mudita. Yes. Delighting in other people 's well-being and good fortune. Yes, we need more of that, or rather, I need more of that. Celebrating everyone 's own expression, gift, purpose, meaning. Mudita. I 'm carrying that word in my heart now. <p> Kelsey, what a happy, happy, beautiful video. And also, I had missed your last post( what with all of the transition and so forth going on in my own life!), but I read it now, and I hope your regret about posting it will quickly pass.

I 've had those moments when I 'll write a post based entirely on an emotion I feel that seems to take over my being. I often edit and rewrite -- it 's the process that helps me actually figure things out. I totally understand the frustration associated with putting something out there that is too raw, unfiltered. I 've been there! In any case, I feel you with the Mudita. I 'm SO thrilled for Sara, and for so many other joys in friends ' lives lately. I want to watch the video over and over again. xo <p> Dhabie Brown <p> Such a beautiful tribute to sprouted kitchen.
