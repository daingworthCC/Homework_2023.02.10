And more importantly, how do you get people to connect with those bigger concepts that a company goes to market with? <p> Recently, I attended an extensive branding conference and was taken by how powerful the messaging was to those employees in attendance -- a " drinking the Kool-Aid " -type effect if you will. And it got me to thinking about those people who seem to just embody the company that they work for -- you know, those people who always seem to be wearing a company-branded polo, or who are constantly posting and re-sharing articles relevant to their job on their social networking sites, those people who are so deeply rooted in the fabric of their business that they turn almost into a mascot of sorts -- I was witnessing the making of these very people. <p> I found it not only to be inspiring, but strategic. Marketing, while primarily intended for an external audience -- or so one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal resources representing the brand, every day. Because, if you do n't have internal buy-in, what do you have? <p> Corporate cheerleaders are n't born, they 're made. <p> In a day and age where bottom lines and budgets are top of mind, sometimes a company 's greatest asset gets overlooked -- its people. And more than that, when it comes down to crunch time, marketing, too, seems to take a backseat. But are n't these the very things that a company should be holding near and dear when everything else seems to be falling by the wayside? <p> I 'd say so. <p> If done correctly, marketing -- and what we 're really talking about in its most pure form is a company 's image -- and the people who represent that company, can carry a business through even the toughest of times. <p> The benefits of a good brand <p> So, what deteriorates a brand? According to a 2008 Biznik article, there are several business brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Inconsistent corporate identity. The branding event that I attended was part of a bigger initiative around the integration of two, multi-billion dollar companies. The feat, while a huge undertaking, will be most profitable if carried out correctly. It is crucial to maintain -- and in the case of integration -- consolidate into one, consistent corporate identity. Back-end systems must work together seamlessly so that the customers on the front-end do not realize any inconsistencies, which means logos need to be the same across-the-board, taglines and messages must relate, and perhaps most importantly, people on the inside need to feel like they 're part of one company. This event, while there were many takeaways, was unifying. <p> Not training employees. Again, it 's easy to call off a lot of initiatives during tough times, but the last resource to be neglected should be people. They are a brand, they are the company. If left untrained or trained incorrectly, there 's no way that a company can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels invested in, they in turn invest. <p> Having a tagline that is not believable. The event, " experts powering the future, " had a clearly defined theme and takeaway message that correlated with the general tagline of the company, " experts powering business. " Not only did much of the conference speak to this messaging, but there were also programs rolled out to further educate internal as well as external resources on the job market, trends in the industry, and the economy -- thus enhancing expertise, and deepening the overall believability of the mission / tagline. It is also fundamental, if there are multiple taglines, to have an overall marketing strategy where everything ties together. " Shaping the world of work " can only be accomplished when you have " experts powering business. " <p> Job seekers and employees alike, take note <p> What this boils down to for employees or for those looking for employment, is that you want to be that resource that a company ca n't imagine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't pay someone -- well, actually I 'm sure that you could and that companies do, but you know what I mean -- you ca n't make someone talk well about their employer or force someone to be passionate about what they do. <p> In today 's economy, a lot of companies are being bought and sold, consolidated and integrated. It 's important to stay educated and refuel your enthusiasm for the brand that you 're representing. There 's always a place for those who are willing to accept and be a part of change. Embrace new beginnings and challenge yourself to try new things. <p> It all ties back into the fact that if you love your job, there 's nobody out there who can do it better than you. Be the brand, live the brand -- because that 's when a job
