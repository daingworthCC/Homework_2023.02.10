5179441 <h> So much to do.... so little time to do it! But we 're getting there! <p> I have sent about 10 emails since 5:01( it 's 5:06 now) we have so many contractors, vendors, business partners, banks, and most importantly customers to talk to! I wish I had more time! I love doing this stuff. Making things come together is an awesome feeling! <p> I have n't gotten to the Loudoun County Chamber of commerce yet, but wow are these guys and gals active! The business community in the Loudoun County area has endless possibilities for supporting eachother and getting the word out about a new place... just like mine! I 'll spend some time tonight trying to figure out how to get that done. Probably starts with getting some stuff printed. I 'm almost out of business cards, I need more mini menu 's and I wish I had some really cool collateral to have flying around town... I do have this cool sticker that I designed.... <p> I want to see these all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. R.S.B you ask... well " Real. Serious. Barbeque. " of course. <p> Do you have great ideas( new and different are preferred) about how to " get the word out "... let 's here them!
