5206741 <h> " Issue 2 : A Matter of Conscience " <p> David Robinson and Colleen Ogle penned the following letter, with others signing on, to urge faith leaders to support Issue 2. They write : <p> Dear Reverend, <p> I 'm writing to you, the leader of your church, about a matter of conscience and the civil covenant we hold with one another. I 'm writing to you today because this covenant is in jeopardy. <p> As I see it, the glory and the burden of being an American lies in the measured exercise of conscience. We are free to worship, believe, speak, and assemble as we choose. Thank God -- and the millions who have sacrificed to make it so. <p> In the public realm, our conscience is most poignantly expressed in the privacy of the voting booth. It is there, in each of our votes, that our belief in the wisdom of the people -- the " consent of the governed " -- as the basis of a just government is made real. It is the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ohio, this covenant has been violated. Yes, I know this is strong language, but it is regrettably true. Let me explain. <p> Following the 2010 census, politicians " gerrymandered " our legislative districts, in a most extreme fashion, such that incumbents no longer need worry about " the consent of the governed "( similar efforts nationwide have resulted in incumbent re-election rates of 95+%). By manipulating the map, squeezing and stretching voters into unnatural and contorted boundaries, they in effect chose who their voters would be ahead of time, turning on its head the most basic of democratic principles. Our government, in a very practical sense, is no longer ours, but has become theirs. This is what I mean by saying our civil covenant has been violated. <p> We are all aware of the sour fruits of this system : extreme partisanship, infantile gridlock, the rule of money, and the money-changers behind it all. <p> Fortunately, we have a rare opportunity this November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. By putting voters first, we will restore our basic civil covenant. Issue 2, supported by the Ohio Council of Churches, The League of Women Voters, and other good-government groups, will create a twelve person Citizens ' Commission, operating fully in the light of day, transparent, for all to see, charged with the profound responsibility of determining legislative boundaries every ten years. Strict criteria of fairness, competitiveness, and community wholeness, will structure and regulate their deliberations and judgments. Details of Issue 2 can be found at www.votersfirstohio.com. <p> Predictably, those currently in power are trying to confuse and distort the basic issue at hand. This wailing of the powerful, when their power is threatened, is not surprising -- their social status, lifestyles, livelihoods, and political egos are all at stake. And through their willingness to participate in the act of gerrymandering they have already demonstrated their inability to resist the temptation of power over principle. This charge applies to politicians of both parties, over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency to the system. And that is why we, the people, must intervene. They can not, despite their protestations, do it themselves. <p> And so I ask that you, as leader of your congregation, take whatever opportunities are appropriate and possible to make these issues visible to your members and to urge them to vote Yes on Issue 2 this November. By passing this vital amendment, our civil covenant will be restored and the voice of individual conscience
