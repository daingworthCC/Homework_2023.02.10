5140341 <p> Daily life in a crazy household with four triplets and two crazy parents. <h> Sunday, November 25, 2012 <h> Remember Me This Way! <p> About 20 minutes after I published my post on Thursday, I began feeling bad. My head started pounding, then I got the chills, and then my body started aching. Within a couple hours, I was literally burning up and writhing in pain. I was so sick, I did n't get off my brother-in-law 's couch for the next 32 hours. <p> My sister-in-law ferments her own probiotics and enzymes using the Body Ecology recipes and starters. I had drank a small amount of fermented juice about 2 hours before I got sick, so at first, I thought I was having a herxheimer reaction. If you 've never herxed before, consider yourself lucky. <p> My SIL has been doing the Body Ecology probiotics for a year and she also got sick when she first started it. There are several probiotics that I have extreme reactions to every time I try to drink them. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Belly yogurt. I get a herx reaction every time. <p> So that 's what I thought was happening. Except now I think I just have the good old-fashioned flu, which would make sense since I was at the school from 7am on Tuesday, until 4pm, cooking, handing out food, cleaning up after people, and being around about 500 students, their grandparents, and their dates for the Manners Dinner. <p> Having Grandparents Day and the Manners Dinner on the same day is INSANE. And what 's more insane is that there are only about six of us mothers who actively run all the events at school and five of them have fifth graders and are leaving. Which means next year, I AM THE ONLY PARENT LEFT. And I 'll be sending out memos saying, " I need help right NOW. Get thee to the school. " <p> It 's all worth it, though, because so many schools have cut out all extracurricular events because they are n't in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their desks and bubbling in circles on tests. The only thing they might remember is standing on stage and singing for their grandmother. I can share this with you because my phone and camera suck and everyone is blurry. <p> I seriously cried every single time I heard the kids practice this song at home. Bless their hearts. Thank goodness I have this blog so I can always remember them this way. <p> So at some point, when handing out food.... <p> Or cleaning up and resetting for the next event..... <p> Or serving my loved ones..... <p> Or bagging up the 10 turkey carcasses we carved for the Manners Dinner and throwing them to my chickens, I picked up the flu. <p> Austin 's teacher came across me trying to drag the turkey carcasses to the car. One of the men double bagged them for me in a big black garbage bag. It looked like I was dragging a body to the car. <p> She helped me and asked me what on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Ohmygod, Michele, do n't ever tell people what you do because you are so disgusting. ", she told me. <p> " You have no idea how disgusting I am. ", I told her. <p> When I was dragging the bag of turkey carcasses across Bob 's backyard, his stupid, stupid, stupid dog attacked me, then the bag broke open in his tennis court and dripped all over my jeans and boots. <h> DISCLAIMER : <h> About Me <p> I am the mother to 8 year old triplets and a 7 year old singleton. With only a 16 month age difference, this makes them Irish Quads.( I am KIDDING, sort of.) I am a follower of the Wingin ' It Parenting Philosophy( WIP). It 's main principle is creating the illusion of having it all together while looking good. I 'm raising 4 happy, secure, somewhat attached children, hopefully with minimum psychological damage from my parenting choices. Our 7 year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain tumor in June 2007.
