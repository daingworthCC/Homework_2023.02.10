The agency was ranked second for innovation among 54 small federal government agencies, based on the 2011 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. <p> " These results point to the intellect, creativity and commitment of OPIC staff to do whatever it takes to find solutions for clients - both internal clients and external ones -- in order to advance our mission, " said OPIC President and CEO Elizabeth Littlefield. <p> Employees who participated in the survey were asked whether they sought new ways to work more effectively and whether they felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And while the recognition is gratifying, the results confirm to a large extent what those of us at OPIC are already seeing.

Relief organizations such as the International Rescue Committee have used these contracts to protect their assets in post-conflict countries. <p> In addition to these changes that have focused on more efficient dealings with clients, OPIC has made targeted investments in IT and E-Business solutions to improve internal operations. These investments saved 16.4% in core technology costs in 2011, which amounts to a 4.7% savings in non-salary administrative costs. <p> In this analysis of the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey results, Partnership for Public Service explains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivering value, particularly in a time of budget constraints when employees are being asked to do more with fewer resources.
