Depending on the arrangement, the affiliate site can be paid for increasing the merchant site 's number of orders or simply bringing them traffic. That 's why those " click here for your free credit score " ads are everywhere on the internet! <p> A lot of these sites also require a $1 fee to process your credit history. They claim that it 's a fully-refundable, one-time charge, but now they have your credit card number, debit card number or other banking information.

Read everything carefully, including the site 's terms of service and privacy policy. Do n't enter your personal information or credit card number if you do n't understand what you 're signing up for. If something seems questionable, wait. You can always register later.

Surprise -- surprise I was charged a monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then found out that someone had used my Social Security number to file taxes this past year. They are the only people I gave my social to. Thank goodness I have Am Ex they were able to get the money back. <p> I signed up for scoresence 's free 7-day trial. The site was great and the details concerning my credit even better. The only issue I found was that there was no way to cancel the 7-day free trial after the call center closed ; this is relevant because the 7-day free trial starts literally the " minute " a person signs up. So if you signed up after the call center hours online, and one can ONLY cancel by calling a sales representitive in the call center, one would need to call prior to the call center closing, and BEFORE the expiration of the free trial, then simply request a email confirmation of the cancellation and they will be happy to ablige. Always remember, if you have to give your Credit Card information to ANY site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a real possibility that if you do n't DO SOMETHING that the site requires BEFORE a specific time, they will charge you MONEY. If that where not the case they would not ask for your Credit Card information. So if you are looking for credit information at any site, read the fine print, and cancel on time. <p> I signed up for scoresense online after I saw the 7-day free trial. The trial is n't free. You pay a $1 processing fee, but after you do you receive three reports and three credit scores. After being scammed by other companies I have used online in the past I made sure to read the fine print. It says in two different places that if you do not cancel the subscription within 7 days you will go into monthly billing. I found the information underneath the place where you put a check mark into the box agreeing to the service and then I found the same information under the term and conditions page.( You have to click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw where the $1 could be refunded if you asked for it when you called to cancel. Now, I do n't know if scoresense is fully legit or not, but I got all three reports and all three scores. I also got my $1 back when I called customer service to cancel the service. No offense to anyone, but people should take the time to read the fine print before they hand over their credit card information and their social security number for any kind of service -- credit or otherwise. <p> This is the biggest scam ever and should be stopped somehow. They are not a legitimate business. I asked for a refund and this is the reply I received : " After careful review of your ScoreSense account, we have determined that we 're unable to approve your request for a refund for the charge of $29.95 that occurred on 7/12/2012. Your request was denied because you requested the refund after your initial free trial period expired or because there is not enough information to substantiate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refund as soon as I received the notice that day that they charged my bank card, and provided them with more than enough information to substantiate a claim. <p> This is definitely scam. There was no indications of this website. I was filling information for a FHA advertisement and this ad about free credit report pops up because it would be required for FHA application. After signing the credit report request for free it ask for a dollar which is refundable with no additional information about a membership or this company viewable. Only a $1 refund was visible. The information was hidden no indications of small print or membership. This site need to be be removed. I requested a refund which i doubt I will receive, but I am reporting it. <p> I used this website by ACCIDENT, looking up a house for sale. I did do the $1.00 fee, at first the computer said I was not approved, then it popped up and said i was approved, BUT it never showed me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Number, and was assured by the young lady I spoke with that I had been charged $19.95 and that she had submitted a request for a refund. She told me I should look for a email with in 48 hrs, confirming the refund. Well I got the email and it says THEY ARE NOT GIVING ME A REFUND... I immediately called my CC, and now I have to go through all this trouble to TRY and get my money back from these CROOKS... Talk about being upset, that does n't even begin to describe how i feel!!! <p> I trusted an ex-girlfriend with all the information she would need to ruin my credit. After three years of not being with this individual I am still getting bills for stuff I myself did not buy. Including credit cards, finger hut, avon, book and magi zine subcriptions. She still gives out my phone number as a contact person.. My husband is convinced that we need to get this. It costs $110 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they do is contact Experian, Transunion and Equifax and tell them that you suspect you might be at risk for identity theft. They provide these companies with 2 phone numbers provided by you. Then if something happens &; your identity gets stolen, it 's your responsibility to call Lifelock &; tell them. If you do n't, they wo n't go to bat for you. If you do everything they tell you to do, they will pay for the legal fees to get your credit straightened out, up to $1,000,000, but they do n't reimburse any lost money... Is my understanding correct? If not, what am I missing?.. Would n't it be better to contact the 3 credit companies and put a security freeze on our credit? Yes, it 's a hassle if we actually want credit, but then no one can get credit in our name, period. No hassles with laywers and ID theft insurance, because no one can get through to the credit companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victim of fraud? Are you dissatisfied with a product or service?
