I 'm not laying bets, but if I were, I would place most of my money on the " we did n't believe hard enough and those bums cast illegal ballots and stole the election. " In which case we get Rick Santorum as the GOP nominee in 2016( and since I 'm laying bets, Marco Rubio for VP, Jeb Bush might be a nice choice, but he wo n't be second fiddle and since he did n't dance this last primary, at best he 'll win Iowa but fade after Super Tuesday). Yeah, that would be my " cover all loses " bet with a high degree of uncertainty( at this time). I mean, the other lesson, the one they should have been learning since 2006 and stubbornly refuse to acknowledge, would require them to actually, you know, reform the whole party but in the opposite direction the Tea Party is taking them. And that wo n't happen. They would n't be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SuperPACs would turn and bite them. So I fully expect the " clap harder " solution to surface as the victor sometime around January 2 or 3, right after we avoid the fiscal cliff( which both sides know will require compromise). If it happens sooner, over the cliff we 'll go. <p> New Age whackaloons vandalize the Serpent Mound. Proof that teh crazy is n't only for the right wing.
