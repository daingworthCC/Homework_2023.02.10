5137341 <h> Italy quake verdict puts all science on trial : seismologists <p> People stand as the court in charge of the trial of six Italian scientists and a government official charged with manslaughter proceeds in L'Aquila, Italy. Seismologists said they were horrified after six of their colleagues were sentenced to six years in jail for manslaughter Monday on charges of underestimating the risk of an earthquake that struck Italy in 2009. <p> " We are deeply concerned. It 's not just seismology which has been put on trial but all science, " Charlotte Krawczyk, president of the seismology division at the European Geosciences Union( EGU), told AFP. <p> The verdict struck at scientists ' right to speak honestly and independently, she said in a phone interview from Germany. <p> " All scientists are really shocked by this, " said Krawczyk. " We are trying to organise ourselves and come up with a strong statement that could help so that the scientists do not have to go to jail. <p> " People are asking, ' Is this really true? ' ' What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it mean for talking in public about risks? ' " <p> " People are stunned, " said Mike Bickle, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Cambridge. <p> Roger Musson at the British Geological Survey( BGS) said the verdict was " unbelievable ". <p> He and other seismologists said it was impossible to forecast an earthquake, and scientists pressed to give a black-or-white answer could unleash panic or lose all credibility if nothing happened. <p> " Seismologists are more or less reconciled to the fact that the chances of predicting when a large earthquake is going to strike are somewhat more remote than finding the Holy Grail, " said Musson. <p> " It will have a chilling effect not just for seismologists but for science. People will be very cautious about giving an opinion, " he warned. <p> They were also ordered to pay morethan nine million euros( $11.7 million) in damages to survivors and inhabitants. <p> They were members of the Major Risks Committee which met in the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened six days before a 6.3-magnitude quake devastated the region, killing 309 people, destroying homes and churches and leaving thousands homeless. <p> Richard Walters of Oxford University said he was " very saddened " by the not be putting responsible scientists who gave measured, scientifically accurate information in prison, " Walters their advice on natural hazards and trying to help society in this way. " <p> David Rothery, a lecturer in earth sciences at Britain 's Open University, said, " The best estimate at the time was that the low level seismicity was not likely to herald a bigger quake, but there are no certainties in this game. <p> " Earthquakes are inherently unpredictable, " he said in remarks reported by the Science Media Centre. " I hope they will appeal. " <h> Filter <p> Scientists in the US do not, for the most part, have to be concerned about landing in jail. They are just used as political footballs and pilloried by the anti-science ideologies that exist here in sizeable minorities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blight on Italian society and I suspect that they have now managed to destroy whatever chance they may have had at capturing any prestige in science at all. Why not? Any scientist who talks about risks or dangers faces jail time. <p> Ironic is many ways. There is a certain inclination amongst some scientists to believe they have replaced religion. There are some that conduct themselves and make pronouncements more appropriate to priests than men of science. So it would seem that, at least in this district in Italy, they have greatly succeed in convincing the public that have replaced GOD as well. So it is perfectly reasonable for the public to hold
