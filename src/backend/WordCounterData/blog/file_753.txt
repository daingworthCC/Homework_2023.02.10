5183941 <h> Friday Humor : " I Am Pledging To Cut The Deficit We Inherited By Half By The End Of My First Term In Office " <p> " We can not and will not sustain deficits like these without end. Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past few years, we can not simply spend as we please and defer the consequences to the next budget, the next administration or the next generation. We are paying the price for these deficits right now. In 2008 alone we paid $250 billion in interest on our debt, that is more than three times what we spent on education that year, more than seven times what we spent on VA healthcare. So if we confront this crisis without also confronting the deficits that helped cause it, we risk sinking into another crisis down the road as our interest payments rise, our obligations come due, confidence in our economy erodes and our children and grandchildren are unable to pursue their dreams because they are saddled with our debts. That 's why today I am pledging to cut the deficit we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office. This will not be easy - it will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we have long neglected but i refuse to leave our children with a debt they can not repay. And that means taking responsibility right now in this administration, for getting our spending under control. " <p> It 's so cool that Michelle Obama is getting involved in the Olympics and teaching kids to eat healthy and get fit! This is what the Olympic spirit is a about - important world leaders getting down to earth and speaking to the people from their hearts. I am humbled that our government is going above and beyond their statutory duties and taking an interest in people 's health. This is going to kickstart a revolution in healthy eating. <p> This gem is incredible and shows the utter and complete failure of Obama 's pledge regarding spending even more so than the speech he gave in 2006 as a Senator, and he does n't have the cover of not knowing the extent of the financial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as he made this pledge during the height of the financial and fiscal crisis. <p> The gap between what Obama pledged and what he has done is larger than any POTUS that I can recall. <p> I make this statement fully convinced that the two party system in the United States is a true illusion of choice, and represents a false left-right paradigm, whereby both parties are financed and work for the same exact people and institutions, and only use social wedge issues du jour to distract and lull the electorate into the belief that the two parties are different in any significant respect. <p> That 's the kind that grows itself during the JulyAugust months while I 'm in Spain with 3 dozen of my BFN 's, then, magically harvests itself &; jumps into Tiffany boxes to hand out to foreign wife dignitaries so that their asses can become as shapely as mine( as illustrated here)... <p> Santilli explains that his knowledge of Rex 84 provides that within the document, one of the scenarios that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights and implement martial law would be a financial collapse. He says once the collapse occurs, the US government and defense agencies estimate they have a 72 hour window to activate all procedures to ensure continuity of government as well as a lockdown of the general population as civilian unrest, riots and outbreaks of violence are anticipated. <p> A source in the Deutsche Bank claims that in 2008 our financial and monetary system completely collapsed and since that time the banking cartels have been " propping up the system " to make it appear as if everything was fine. In reality our stock market and monetary systems are fake ; meaning that there is nothing holding them in place except the illusion that they have stabilized since the Stock Market Crash nearly 5 years ago. <p> Since this time, the Department of Homeland Security( DHS) in conjunction with FEMA and other federal agencies have been quickly working to set in place their directives of control under a silent martial law. <p> The Deutsche Bank informant says that the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cash needed quickly to repay China who had purchased large quantities of mortgage-backed securities that went belly-up when the global scam was realized. When China realized that they had been duped into buying worthless securitized loans which would never be repaid, they demanded the actual property instead. The Chinese were prepared to send their " people " to American shores to seize property as allocated to them through the securitized loan contracts. <p> Being cynical and inherently skeptical of government intentions as I am, I love a good conspiracy as much as anyone, but, and this is not intended to offend you or directed at you personally, that article reads like something written under the influence of waaaay too much chronic, or by the Department of Homeland Dis-Information in order to portray anyone advocating that government agencies are anything other than completely benevolent is batshit crazy. <p> When China realized that they had been duped into buying worthless securitized loans which would never be repaid, they demanded the actual property instead. The Chinese were prepared to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as allocated to them through the securitized loan contracts. <p> It makes sense to me as alphabet soup agencies are all playing secret agent man these days, and the 750 million hollow point bullets the government recently purchased to use on American civilians is telling. <p> Lol, not exactly. Face the facts. The U.S. Government ca n't keep track of anything except chosen data. With this many bullets laying around, there are reasons for them coming up missing including black market sales, bartering etc. Yes it is a hell of a number but not all of the military and/or police departments, sheriffs, etc., will go along with the insanity of betrayal to the U. S. Constitution and WILL play a large role in a revolution, probably confiscating millions of rounds for the good guys. It is always wise to be aware of the surrounding but to give up hope is not something that I will be party to. Guess we 're going to see what happens. <p> Hey Michelle, just try growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WH. The militarized, code violation police from city council would soon have that uprooted and your home surrounded by thought police. Wait a sec, that is the case already. <p> Another option is we simply change the way we calculate the debt. This is a time tested Govemenment method( or banking) to meet goals. Move liabilties from one column over to the asset side and poof... the national debt is gone. Of course we still owe 16 Trillion, but that debt is now an asset! <p> Or hire Corzine to make it vaporise, in exchange we let him off the hook for all the criminal charges currently pending and commute his current prison term. I assume this would be a good deal for him as the law must be all over him <p> The appropriate response should state that the deficit is an outcome and not a decision variable, it emanates from revenues and expenses, and expenses itself are consequences of the ambition and scope of activities carried out and promises made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government, its scope of activities, giving up on the promises it has made, which at this point means breaking a lot of promises, and stopping to make new promises and keeping its ambitions and activities limited. <p> But reaching a consensus for this requires an attitude shift. To reduce central government scope and ambition requires a different view that favors, encourages, cheers for and supports people and organizationss with vastly different attributes in a society : Decentralization, self-sufficiency, resilience, autonomy, awareness, alertness, positive attitudes to entrepreneurs and trade based on sound money with the risk of failure and pushing responsibility back to a local level in all matters of importance : health care, education, law enforcement, industry policy, agriculture, the list goes on. <p> To avoid doing this requires the combined skills of a pathological liar that can continue to extend promises as well an overly ambitious mentality with high charisma that can convince voters to approve of overly ambitious grand schemes and plans and government-sponsored activities, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits Obama 's skill set exactly. He represents the secret wish of many voters : they want to be lied to, they want to believe in eternal promises, grand plans and be taken care of so they can stop being alert. <p> " Follow the leaer " is what I see more and more people doing. Do n't pay for anything---mortgages, credit cards, doctors bills---just put it on credit( or a loan) and then follow the leaders and don ; t pay it off. <p> It 's an infection from the top doan that is changing our " work ethic " culture. Long term looks dismal if leaders and the people who follwo them, go this path. Just another eason why house prices will continue to plunge..... <p> We can start with the bloat at the Department of Homeland Security, that as of Feb 2010 has nearly 400,000 employees, 12,000 of whom make in excess of $150K per year. I wish Ron Paul stayed in the game and fought the good fight. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of eliminating half of the alphabet agencies and departments that are bleeding our nation dry? No wonder the feds borrow 40 of every dollar they spend. I think they 're going to borrow till the whole thing collapses ; but it 's not going to be allowed to collapse until enough people and businesses are either bankrupt or on the government dole and under their control. <p> Then the fascists can get on with their depopulation agenda, while blaming everything on the free market that never was -- or on the rural white guy with a gun who would n't know a credit default instrument( ie the banker death star built to destroy the planet 's economic system born in the City of London) if it stared him in the face. <p> The Senate came awful close to taking out the insane media this past week. Amazingly " we need 60 votes to be safe in our own home. " yet the more amazing thing is that the vote happened at all... and that it got a clear majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cleared. I might not live to see the day but to me " the outcome is not in doubt. " I would not be surprised to see trials as a result of what 's been going on oh these last few years. A TRUE consensus is now forming across the entirety of Washington DC to attack this monstrosity of identity annihilation and I think the folks who 've made it their life 's work will soon rue the day that were ever even born. <p> " I Am Pledging To Cut The Deficit We Inherited By Half By The End Of My First Term In Office " <p> Like ALL first class bullshitters &; politicians and professional liers..... <p> there are zero consequences for failure. <p> Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery. Winston Churchill <p> My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure. Abraham Lincoln <p> There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbins <p> The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America 's debt. Barack Obama <p> Soaring deficits and debt were indicative of leadership failure under Bush. Obama, in his drive to fundamentally change America by making the 99.9% equally miserable and dependent, probably considers himself a success. <p> If the gub says " kill your horse " will you? Every day is full of real examplrs that you can use with people you meet everyday to turn the absurd around on them. Wherever I AM I piss my wife off with my diatribes basef on experience, facr and faith When it 's wrong you know it and you must speak up. I have nothibg but a voice and I travel far abd wide! Thank me! <p> Freedome is relative. What one liberal thinks is individual freedom may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservative calls freedom might be called imposing ones position on others. <p> The nation is very divisive and often it is considered ideologically divisive. But I think both sides are being played against each other by manipulating the definition of freedom. Quite frankly, my fish in his little tank probably thinks he is free. I think I 'll flush the sob down the toilet tomorrow. <p> If socialism is failure then why did Winston Churchill have a government job instead of striking on his own private enterprenuership? <p> Lincoln initially supported slavery in states where it already existed via Corwin Amendment in the constitution because he had no balls like Obama and played the bipartician compromise game to benefit his own political career. Later northern industrialists realized that free slaves would be cheaper for low wage factory jobs in midwest than unskilled whites or importing more slaves from africa, so they supported the emancipation. <p> Tony Robbins is a bullshit artist. what quantifiable results has brought to the listeners of his dribble? Did tech startup founders listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for Fortune 500 corporate drone types to get excited about TPS reports. results tell you that you failed or not. <p> Just like Lincoln, Obama has a choice to further his own career or help America turnaround from oligarchy at the risk of even a civil war. 99% are the slaves of the south. Labor debt slaves beholden to bankster masters. He is from priviledged upbringing, so he will never see non-elites as equal. However, he can free the people from financial terrorists controlling everything by money they print themselves. <p> Both are ultra statist lunatics, why not? Obama is the natural and predictable result of Lincoln, and I find it amusing that the descendants of his armies are being ground to dust by the power of the very same hyperpowered central authority they fought for. <p> I simply do not care why anyone is or is not a commenter here, it does n't matter to me in the slightest. You are clearly bothered that ZH is not as you want it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whatever works for ya, but I do n't see it happening. Personally, I think the whole " And now... Katy Perry! " thing is somewhat amusing. <p> As far as Lincoln goes it has nothing to do with a hangup and everything to do with understanding the sequence of events that lead to where we are now. I like to have an idea not only of what the world is, but also how it got that way and see him as the first major force in the march towards hyperpowered central government in US history. <p> Why are people still surprised by this? This is what they do, politicians, lawyers, brokers, etc., anyone who sells a service for a living. What gets me is that the people who complain the most that they were lied to are the same people that fall for the same shit over and over again. The real problem is that the majority of the public is not saavy enough to call bullshit, the second it leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same shit... <p> He has, over time, transformed himself through the crucible of black nationalist theology( I defy anyone to dispute it, in fact call me a racist for saying it, its true) into the belle of fascist ball that all marxists try so hard to resist... but fantasize about daily( you marxists know this to be true of yourselves, if only you could control the means of production... lol). <p> You ca n't, no more than you can control the narcissistic " marxist " you thought you were voting for. At what point after him hooking up with Rezko did you throw your " dreams " away is what I wan na know. <p> I find Oblahma 's white side of the family far more interesting. Let 's see... Obama 's Mama( Stanley Ann Dunham) spent quite a bit of time working for the Ford Foundation( known CIA front) in Indonesia with her direct supervisor being current SEC Treasury Timmah 's daddy... Hmmm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama back in 2009 : <p> Barack Obama is a corporate marketing creation John Pilger <p> Author, journalist, film maker John Pilger speaks at Socialism 2009 <p> Filmed by Paul Hubbard at the Womens Building in San Francisco 7-4-09. <p> " Attorney General Eric Holder finally got fed up Tuesday with claims that the Justice Department went easy in a voting rights case against members of the New Black Panther Party because they are African American. <p> Holder 's frustration over the criticism became evident during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing as Rep. John Culberson( R-Texas) accused the Justice Department of failing to cooperate with a Civil Rights Commission investigation into the handling of the 2008 incident in which Black Panthers in intimidating outfits and wielding a club stood outside a polling place in Philadelphia. <p> The Attorney General seemed to take personal offense at a comment Culberson read in which former Democratic activist Bartle Bull called the incident the most serious act of voter intimidation he had witnessed in his career. <p> " Think about that, " Holder said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, and to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia -- which was inappropriate, certainly that... to describe it in those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all, for my people, " said Holder, who is black. <p> Holder noted that his late sister-in-law, Vivian Malone Jones, helped integrate the University of Alabama. <p> " To compare that kind of courage, that kind of action, and to say that the Black Panther incident wrong thought it might be somehow is greater in magnitude or is of greater concern to us, historically, I think just flies in the face of history and the facts., " Holder said with evident exasperation. " <p> Now, what that has to do with whether or not voter intimidation happened in Philadelphia is anyones guess. But apparently, law is now only applied when the skin pigment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> J Christian Adams has been all over this one and resigned in disgust when Holder refused to prosecute... and now we have this little noticed court ruling... page 13... <p> " The Court finds that the foregoing emails added, at least to some degree, " ' to the fund of information that citizens may use in making vital political choices. ' " Cotton, 63 F.3d at 1120( citation omitted). The documents reveal that political appointees within DOJ were conferring about the status and resolution of the New Black Panther Party case in the days preceding the DOJ 's dismissal of claims in that case, which would appear to contradict Assistant Attorney General Perez 's testimony that political leadership was not involved in that decision. " <p> Modern politics and politicians are by its nature " corporate marketing "... so in that sense I would have to agree with Pilger. <p> But its not the same as calling O'Barry a free market capitalist or a corporatist, which he is decidely not. <p> One does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this. He has always believed in the power of the state over and at the expense of, the individual or anything. Its why he went into politics in the first place. You should dig up his concept of " negative liberty " for review and its implications for a free republic operating under the rule of law. <p> They are incompatible and contradictory with any " free society ". <p> His latest " You did n't build that " is how he really feels about capitalists and free will... which is, at the personal level, nothing more than exercising ones right to fail or succeed on their own merits. How anyone could defend the intelligence level or good intentions of government bureacracies after what has transpired is either stupid or being openly deceitful. <p> The real tragedy of the un-vetted " brand " of O'Barry( which is what I think Pilger meant) is how so many could have been fooled by this farcical character of a man. <p> I guess we 're all either ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " brand " of O'Barry( which is what I think Pilger meant) is how so many could have been fooled by this farcical character of a man. " <p> I agree. <p> BUT this would also apply equally : <p> " " brand " of Bush II... is how so many could have been fooled by this farcical character of a man. " <p> You can plug any President 's name in there, going back at least a century if not longer. <p> The bottom line that the US Govt has not been serving the real interests of it 's people for a long time now. Which political party/ideology was/is in charge is meaningless noise. The real job is to identify the true perps that hijacked our Govt and deal with them. This does not absolve the people though, we all played our parts in allowing/ignoring/and in many cases condoning the hijacking of our Govt.. <p> IMO the main vehicle of that hijacking was the wresting of this nation 's ' money. ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " brand " of Bush II... is how so many could have been fooled by this farcical character of a man. " <p> Agreed... I 've long held the view that Bush came in a social conservative and left as a conservative socialist... lol. <p> " You can plug any President 's name in there, going back at least a century if not longer. " <p> Nefarious dickweeds will always attack freedom wherever it springs up. Some of them do it for personal gain, some are genuinely ignorant of what they are doing. <p> " The real job is to identify the true perps that hijacked our Govt and deal with them. This does not absolve the people though, we all played our parts in allowing/ignoring/and in many cases condoning the hijacking of our Govt. <p> IMO the main vehicle of that hijacking was the wresting of this nation 's ' money. ' I also think that goes back further than 1913. " <p> No truer statement has ever been uttered. The vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> It is a creation of government... for government. <p> It provides( theoretically) the means for politicians to go unaccountable for their reckless spending of the peoples treasure/taxes. This is of great benefit to politicians as they can promise the moon &; stars above to anyone, securing their power through " democracy ". <p> For the banker, it provides a steady stream of income with the only real loss being one of integrity &; prestige, something they never really had among the people anyways... lol. <p> The accounting works until it is realized broadly that sheer numbers alone do n't reflect the quality of the underlying. <p> We still retain the power to put a stop to it at anytime. There has never been any law created across the expanse of history that has more weight than the will of the people and never will be. Its just going to take enough people to look at themselves in the mirror first and say I refuse to be ruled by my inferiors and then stop accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my side " came after my guns while attempting to confiscate more &; more of my time and property under the guise of fairness... so the D &; R thing does n't hold a particular bond on me. <p> It just so happens today I am registered as an R but many R 's are also old D 's and new T 's ; -) <p> What I believe is happening is the Tea Party is taking over the GOP just as academics, media and " progressives " in general have taken over the old Democrat Party. <p> A blue blooded former NE govenor was not my first choice( in the primary I voted Paul) but he( Romney) is still more qualified than O'Barry was just by virtue of being a govenor, no matter where. If I thought an L( Johnson) had a legitimate shot at the presidency I would be promoting him but the problem there is stripping away potential votes from Romney... in my view the danger is greater with a second O'Barry term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any law but his own. <p> He 's now acting as a despot... examples include... illegal immigration, GM bond holders, pills for frat girls, relaxing welfare work requirements, Gibson guitar goonery and his latest... asking defense contractors to violate the WARN Act to postpone them getting layoff notices before the election... just to name a few. <p> After this turd is out we can talk about new parties or new politics... all that matters for the country now is getting him out... nothing else. <p> That very well may be... but perhaps America is entitled to a better class of liar? One not nearly as " transparent " in his lies... lol. <p> I kid... as I said, I voted Paul, he did n't make it through. I 'm not going to cry about it, pick up my ball &; go home. <p> You have n't said who or what you support?... given the reality of the situation. <p> I 'll leave you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions( both equal, co-branches) of government on more than one occasion. <p> Congress( meaning only the House, somehow, in his mind) I can deal with, its political, so no harm no foul... but not SCOTUS deliberations &; decisions, whether I agree with those decisions/outcomes or not. <p> Its sorta like jury tampering... its a felony for sheeple to do it. <p> He 's already made his intentions clear for those with an open mind... he desires to RULE not govern... that is a HUGE DIFFERENCE and it speaks directly to his conceit, arrogance and manipulative character. Even when confronted with the truth of his failures as a president and a man he grasps for scapegoats &; strawmen... instead of sucking it up and trying something different. <p> I have been virulently ABO ever since his bitter clinger comment( another window into his soul)... and I remain so. <p> Thanks Ned... it is remarkable and damning evidence of how he thinks &; what he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our " constitutional law professor president " is saying here... <p> The people, in the act of instituting a system of laws, in how we will interact with each other and this new government going forward from that point in time... &gt;&gt;&gt;by placing constraints on the power and scope of a federal government&lt;&lt;&lt;... is equal to an infringement on that governments liberty. <p> Its the most bizzare thing he 's ever said up until " You did n't build that! " The inner workings of the mind of a statist. <p> And this tape was well known outside of the sphere of the state controlled media complex. <p> " Rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed by murder ; electric shock( ' the Bell Telephone Hour ') rendered by attaching wires to the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue ; the ' water treatment ' ; the ' airplane ' in which the prisoner 's arms were tied behind the back, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, suspending the prisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten ; beatings with rubber hoses and whips ; the use of police dogs to maul prisoners. " <p> Strawman. Capitalism has precisely nothing to do with the Viet Cong or the imperial American military. There are far better strawmen to hoist if you wish to slander capitalism than the punishment dealt to a liberation front/terrorist organization involved in a proxy war between two
