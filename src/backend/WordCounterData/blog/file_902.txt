5199141 <h> HubSpot 's Inbound Internet Marketing Blog <p> " Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes. " Could David Bowie 's 70s hit be a marketer 's theme song, or what? <p> On a related -- but arguably more serious -- note, according to the 2012 CMO Survey by the American Marketing Association and Duke University, Marketing appears to be one of the early rebounders in the initial economic recovery. In terms of both department size and budget, Marketing is on the rise. <p> Just take a look at how the size of business ' marketing departments has more than doubled -- in fact, almost tripled -- since August 2011... <p> And as the role of marketing grows, it also continues to evolve. Today 's marketing department, for example, looks very different than it did even just a few short years ago. In fact, a collection of new roles has emerged, and they 're growing in importance within many marketing teams. <p> Let 's examine what each of these roles consist of, and why you might want to consider adding them to your growing marketing team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operations / Pipeline Specialist <p> Marketing operations professionals are charged with m onitoring, measuring, and analyzing the effectiveness of marketing initiatives as they relate to the overall company 's goals. Marketing operations staff work closely with Sales, and sometimes also have a sales operations counterpart. Together, they manage the relationship between Marketing and Sales to ensure that both sides are optimized to deliver( Marketing 's role) and work( Sales ' role) the highest quality leads, something HubSpot has grown fond of calling " SMarketing. " Marketing operations staff make projections about the quality of the sales and marketing pipeline and find efficiencies that will make the company work better as a whole. <p> Marketing operations would be a fit for anyone who has an analytical mind and is interested in marketing and sales strategy. Karen Rubin, a HubSpotter in a marketing operations role adds : " We focus on helping our marketers get the analytics they need, running monthly reports, and understanding why data and results are looking the way they do at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experience Professionals <p> In 2011, Forrester released a report called " The Rise of the Chief Customer Officer. " The report detailed a trend existing among B2B and B2C companies alike -- hiring an individual to oversee customer communications and customer happiness. While the report focuses on a formal, executive-level role( " CCO "), we 've seen this trend at all levels in companies. <p> Roles under this subset include community managers, customer experience designers, and customer communications officers. Skills and focus areas range, but the customer evangelist is essentially the internal voice of the customer within a company. Sometimes measured by Net Promoter Score surveys or user testing, their role aims to keep customer happiness and loyalty high by making customers ' experiences with the company easy and rewarding. Beyond being " the right thing to do, " creating a positive customer experience actually drives results. In fact, according to Nielsen 's April 2012 Global Trust in Advertising report, 92% of consumers worldwide trust recommendations from friends and family more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market, the role of a customer evangelist becomes all the more critical. <h> Inbound Marketing Strategist <p> It 's no news to us, but recent research from SiriusDecisions underscores the shift that B2B companies are making toward inbound marketing as a core strategy, and the need for more inbound marketing talent. " More than any other new approach, inbound marketing is rapidly becoming a standard part of the marketing mix, " writes Jay Gaines, who leads SiriusDecisions ' Demand Creation Strategies advisory service. Inbound marketing strategists must have a comprehensive mix of skills including search engine optimization, content strategy, and content mapping against a lead 's decision-making process. Gaines writes : " SiriusDecisions expects the inbound marketer to become a fixture in the majority of b-to-b marketing organizations in the next one to two years. " <h> Lead Nurturing Specialist <p> As most savvy marketers will tell you, attracting traffic and converting those visitors into leads is only half the battle. All too many potential customers get stuck in the middle of the marketing funnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professionals skilled in lead nurturing help marketing teams deliver highly tailored content to guide leads to a point of decision. And research shows that personalized marketing leads to more customer conversions than generalized communications. <p> The lead nurturing role in an organization is steeped in customer and lead data. According to that same AMA/Duke University CMO Survey, " The ability to leverage information about customers in order to deliver and demonstrate value opens the door for marketers to fill the role as analysts and ' data whisperers. ' " <h> Documentarian / Videographer <p> Technology has lowered the barriers to creating high-quality videos, making creation and distribution more affordable for companies of all sizes. As a result, video as a form of content is on the rise. It 's no surprise then, that 87% of online marketers use video content, according to Outbrain 's State of Content Marketing. Not to mention that Social Media Examiner reported earlier this year that 76% of marketers planned to increase their use of YouTube and video marketing, making it the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this investment in video as a content format, many companies are adding videographers to their marketing teams. We asked Chris Savage, co-founder and CEO of Wistia, a video hosting and analytics provider, what companies should look for when hiring video talent. " Adding the right videographer to your team can unlock an entire new channel of content for you, " said Savage. " The key is finding someone who has a mix of skills that complement your existing team. Besides just the basics of lighting, shooting, and editing, you really want someone who has a strong sense for what topics will be most successful on video. " <h> Partnership / Co-Marketing Manager <p> Co-marketing is the practice of two, complementary companies collaborating on content or marketing initiatives. As a result, co-marketing brings fresh perspectives to your marketing initiatives and helps each company reach an audience that might not otherwise have found them. <p> Dan Slagen, head of global marketing relations at HubSpot leads our co-marketing initiatives. Dan explains, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help promote the marketing industry. For HubSpot, the value of working with partners such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Salesforce, and Google has been an array of thought leadership, brand alignment, and new business opportunities for all parties involved. " <h> Changes to Existing Roles <p> In addition to the growing prominence of some newer roles, a number of existing marketing roles have begun to change and adapt as well. Here are some top trends we 've noticed. <h> Social Media as a Core Skill <p> Five years ago, a marketing department might have hired a young graduate to head up its social media strategy. But according to the 2011 Webmarketing123 State of Digital Marketing report, with an average of 68% of marketers generated leads from social media sites, social media is no longer a specialization but rather a core marketing skill. As such, new marketing hires at every level should be expected to understand and contribute to social media strategies. <h> Analytics as a Core Skill <p> As you may have noticed above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging marketing positions. In fact, the AMA/Duke CMO survey cites that spending on marketing analytics is expected to increase 60% by 2015. As marketing departments grow in size and marketing budgets increase, the ability to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and channels will become more and more essential. Read more about how to cultivate a data-driven marketing team in this blog post. <h> The Technology CMO <p> In a Gartner study, Vice President of Marketing Strategies Laura McLellan asserts, " By 2017, the CMO will spend more on IT than the CIO. " Her assertion is backed by survey data in which 90% of respondents said that the marketing department is either solely responsible or leads a cross-functional team that sets the strategy for technology purchasing decisions. Marketers have more and more say in the technology they use to do their jobs. Enough said. <h> Media Relations : Less Pitch, More Support <p> According to the AMA/Duke University CMO survey, only 53% of companies are using marketing staff for traditional public relations activities, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Talking with Laura Fitton, HubSpot 's inbound marketing evangelist, you 'll quickly learn that she prioritizes being helpful to journalists and bloggers over pitching to them. Even when it does n't result in a news story about HubSpot, Laura 's priority is to help journalists make connections and find data for their reports. <h> COMMENTS <p> Nice article Meghan. Even Product Management does marketing now as evidenced by your thoughtful post. As an Internet marketer, I love the fact that Marketing budgets are growing on the leading edge of the economic recovery. Smart businesses see marketing as an investment opportunity to capture and grow market share. Marry that with smart technologies to implement inbound marketing efficiently through automation, resulting in each additional marketing $ going further while tracking that against investments. Another powerful effect of marketing automation is to bring sales and marketing together in a way that is both effective and efficient while maximizing ROI. Thanks for sharing. <p> Great post. We are recruiters for sales, sales engineering and marketing people for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand to the inbound-grounded marketing staff and managers has been profound. It 's brought a new level of accountability to marketing departments, and in the firms that have dedicated the resources and talent to these efforts, they 've seen the payoff and are now doubling down on their marketing programs. What I am seeing now is the most metrics-oriented people are now the decision-makers in the marketing department @ my clients, and they want similarly-disposed staff. People who are great content creators, partner well with sales and sales operations teams and are focused on gathering customers. Thanks again <p> What a great and insightful article. We 've introduced a similar concept called the Revenue Department that blends sales and marketing into a single team of people focused on driving the customer experience from the time they first interact with your company or content online all the way through to securing them as a customer. This includes many of the roles you mentioned in your post. To learn a little more about the Revenue Department, click here. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Our search marketing firm recently added me as Content Marketing Manager in response to the growing need of our clients to create content as part of their search marketing strategies. We 're quickly fleshing out my content marketing team with a PR manager and plans to add a videographer. <p> This is a very powerful presentation of the fact that marketing is/must play an important and growing role in the success of a business or organization. One practical concern is how do you ramp up a company with, for example, 30 employees and perhaps 1/2 person devoted to marketing when the chart shows that about 3 employees or 10-12% are the competitive norm. <p> This is not going to happen quickly. So I 'd like to introduce the idea of a MKO - Marketing Knowledge Officer - who can bridge the employee gap with the knowledge of how to bring external resources into play to make up the difference. <p> This is really interesting information. I would never have thought that there would be such a spike in marketing employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't large increases before that. <p> Makes me glad that I 'm moving into the Social Media Marketing area for a career. <p> Everyone works for the marketing department of their company now. Everything you do can impact your company, good or bad, everything you write( blog comments, Facebook comments, Facebook likes) leave an audit trail of your opinion. <p> Job titles only become important when you are looking for a job. Everyone is an evangelist for their company. <p> Even roles like reputation management can sit squarely with marketers, no matter how good your print/TV/radio is, if you handle a customer experience badly or well, it can go viral quicker than any designed campaign. <p> Spend money on tools, set up Google alerts, but always be monitoring and checking the sentiment and responding, thank everyone for their feedback, even if it is negative. <p>( As an aside, though : there is ZERO CHANCE the first chart - showing that marketing has tripled its percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't change at that rate. This is very clearly a sampling problem.) <p> Nice piece, and thank you for gathering some great resources/links. As the pace of change appears to be moving faster than ever, those who stay informed, stay relevant. Thanks for sharing the perspective and insights. <p> posted on Friday, November 16, 2012 at 12:40 PM by John Ayers <p> Many marketing veterans have trouble with the new Inbound Marketing reality. We see the same transformation in sales with Inside Sales teams leading a data driven remote professional sales reality that many sales veterans are uncomfortable with. Embrace and lead the transition to win. <p> " Everyone is an evangelist for their company " Jim Banks is dead right. <p> There is a great need to broker relationships across silos that 's why I evangelise about Yammer. <p> The modus operandi of organizations is changing within and without the walls and territories of business entities. Finding the right relationship is key and JP Rangaswami 's blog post " Social is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covenants. a more collaborative approach in the workplace or indeed worldplace. http : **35;4930;TOOLONG... <p> Back to work tomorrow as Head of Collaboration! <p> posted on Sunday, November 18, 2012 at 3:42 PM by Tim Harrap <p> Nice post. Lead nurturing owner and a CMO 's CTO are 2 roles that we see as increasing in importance. I suspect the data point around headcount. Perhaps true for budget but not for marketing FTE vs. overall FTE. We struggle with building discipline around inbound marketing and have recently opened a position for head of inbound marketing.
