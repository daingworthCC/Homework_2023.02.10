5128641 <h> watching you race toward the apocalypse you created <p> once upon a time, a small winged creature emerged from behind a rock and took a look around at the world - but the light was bright, the paths busy and their occupants loud and boisterous, and the creature has been trying to find a new rock ever since <p> It turns out that Britain is a country in which the mildest, most peaceful form of political protest imaginable -- heckling a politician during a public speech -- is now a crime. This is the kind of thing you expect to read about in Cuba, with a hundred right wing loonies tutting about the wonders of freedom as defined by Western capitalism in the comments. I can not imagine how the people of Britain have become so complacent that we are n't greeting the news of this with a million people standing vigil in front of Downing Street until the sentence -- and the " crime " for which it was given -- is revoked. <p> We 've slid into authoritarian dictatorship. At this point, elections every five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow too many of us to pretend that what is happening in this country is n't really happening. <p> The next time some well-meaning idiot says, after an election, that they " just overthrew the government ", I 'm going to remind them of this, and ask them if they think that they stopped it from happening in the future. <p> But then, I doubt I 'm going to get the chance again. I am now 100% certain that there will be no election in 2015 -- and increasingly persuaded that there will be no election before or after 2015 either. The Conservatives only pay lip service to democracy until it stops working for them ; after that, it 's whoever has the most guns. <p> They are traitors to our country, and should be treated as such. And if they 're going to try and criminalise those of us who say so, then perhaps the time for saying so has passed. <p> addendum. One other point alarms me. By now it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sure way to receive a sentence whose disproportion would incense Draco 's sense of justice is to plead guilty when it comes to trial -- and that without a guilty plea, those so prosecuted stand a strong chance of an acquittal. So what the hell kind of pressure is being brought to bear on them that so many of them, like the broken victims of Stalin 's show trials confessing in halting voices to crimes they had clearly never heard of before the scripts of their confessions were set before them, persist in sanctioning their own persecution from the dock? The UK has been revealed to be complicit in torture abroad -- perhaps such behaviours are learned at home, in dealing with those " subversives " not sufficiently organised
