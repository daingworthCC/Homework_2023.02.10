5146341 <h> ' The Walking Dead ' : Welcome to Woodbury! New season 3 images of the Governor, Andrea and Michonne with intel from the actors -- EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS <p> While the other survivors from Hershel 's farm massacre will make a prison their home in season 3 of The Walking Dead, Andrea -- who was separated from the group and saved by a mysterious hooded figure named Michonne in the finale -- will end up somewhere else entirely : the town of Woodbury, Ga. There, Andrea and Michonne will be introduced to a man with the first name of Philip who is better known by another moniker : the Governor. And we have a few brand new photos of all three characters in this new environment below, as well was intel from the actors that play them on what to expect in season 3. <p> The action in season 3 picks up several months after the end of season 2, and in that time, Andrea and Michonne have become very close. " For Michonne, it 's the first time she has opened up since her trauma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " says the woman who plays her, Danai Gurira. " So Andrea is the first person she 's really been able to open up to, to love, to care for, take care of. I think there 's a lot of yearning in her humanity to be able to do that with somebody. And she 's found the person for her. " <p> But that bond will be tested when the duo arrives in Woodbury, a place that Michonne does not trust, but appeals to Andrea. " She asked a lot of questions at first and she was a bit wary, " says Laurie Holden, who plays Andrea. " But the Governor is very seductive -- in a calm, loving sense. If you look around, everybody seems happy ; there are children playing ball with dogs, and pregnant women walking around happier than clams, and there are cellos in the street being set up for the blues band. It 's pretty idyllic. " <p> But is this entire scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose charm covers up a ruthless power-mad person underneath? " People in the world that we inhabit need structure, they need to feel safe, and he provides that, " says the man who plays the Governor, David Morrissey. " And I think any leader of any community has to earn trust. And the idea of power is a really interesting idea of how people keep their power in a community. They keep it in all different ways. They can keep it by being generous, by facilitating your good life by giving you gifts. But they can also take those gifts away, they can be intimidating. They can be powerful, they can protect you from the enemy, whether that protection is just a fight or not, or whether they create the feeling of paranoia in order to suppress it. That is a great game that politicians and power-hungry people do. I think he does all those things.
