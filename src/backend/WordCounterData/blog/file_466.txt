5154941 <p> Many companies in the games hardware race have utilised this tactic in the past, which involves taking a hit on every unit you sell, in order to give customers a cheap entry point and then make money back on the games they buy. But Nintendo has traditionally made a profit on every console it 's ever sold, except for early versions of the 3DS after that massive early price cut. <p> Iwata 's statement in full reads : <p> During the second quarter of this fiscal term, we have successfully eliminated the situation that we sell the Nintendo 3DS hardware below cost, which was the main reason our corporate profits fell in the last term. However, as we are in the phase of concentrating our development resources on software for the Nintendo 3DS system, which is still in an earlier stage of penetration than that of Nintendo DS, and as we have not yet launched the Wii U system, it is difficult to increase the total sales of software, which is generally profitable. <p> In addition to the yen 's continuous appreciation, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's profits early after the launch because rather than determining a price based on its manufacturing cost, we selected one that consumers would consider to be reasonable. In this first half of the term before the launch of the Wii U, we were not able to make a profit on software for the system while we had to book a loss on the hardware, which is currently in production and will be sold below cost. <p> Our loss has therefore widened during the second quarter in spite of bringing the Nintendo 3DS hardware back to profitability. Although we expect our financial performance to be revitalized, under these circumstances, unfortunately we can not say that we will achieve ' Nintendo-like ' profits within this fiscal year. <p> " We will make best efforts to retrieve " Nintendo-like " profits by : <p> Boosting sales of the Nintendo 3DS system as a sound successor to Nintendo DS both in Japan and overseas during the year-end sales season, <p> Launching the Wii U system successfully in each part of the world in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, <p> Transforming our business structure in line with the times, including the expansion of our digital business to increase our business efficiency and profitability. <p> We dare n't speculate on how much of a loss the Wii U will make if it does achieve the 5.5 million sales the company is predicting it will shift by April. A loss of 2 a console is 11 million, 10 a console would be 55 million... it 's scary stuff. And then there 's the old ' attachment rate ' issue. Nintendo is expecting 24 million software units to be sold in 2013 's financial year, which is over 4 games per console, if they meet their targets. <p> We do n't normally report on industry analyst Michael Pachter 's ' predictions ', but he 's got a point when he says the expected attachment rate is " highly unrealistic given the steep price of both console models( which will limit the applicable gamer 's ability to purchase additional games), 23 launch-day releases( with some likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many big names but lasts 4.5 months, and compelling competitive devices. " It 's hard to argue with that logic. <p> Nintendo and Wii U are bound to be absolutely fine. Even if they take a hit on the unit price, their standard license fee grab will see them right with the starter games alone. The launch is expected to be pretty slow but the company is rich enough to push it through regardless. <p> The main thing I 'm looking forward to is seeing if they pull the old stock shortages trick again. Conspiracy theories aside, the Wii was rare as rocking horse shit for 12 months post-launch. Nothing whips up the crowd more. Will everyone fall for it again? <p> I do n't think it 's going to sell nearly as much as Nintendo thinks it will. They 've lost a lot of fans at the end of the Wii 's life cycle( which was n't as long as the PS3 's or 360 's) And from what I can see there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few months, all the others are games you can already find for way cheaper on their competitors systems. Also, I 'm pretty sure everyone is getting sick of all the add-ons and gimmicks Nintendo has sold for the Wii that added almost nothing to the actual immersion or depth of the game. If I 'm going to spend my hard earned money on extra devices to help a game I 'm already purchasing at full price, it 'd better add a lot to the freaking game and be pretty darn near spot on perfect control wise. And sadly it looks like the new tablet that comes with the system will be just another crap gimmick that wo n't actually add much to how the games are played. <p> I think its being said that they have n't release many consoles( for pre-ordering) to begin with, meaning that being sold out is only due to the low supplies, not necessarily the high demand. Not that there is n't a high demand, but they have n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't want to sell stand alone Game-pads due to manufacturing speed. Which although there is no games that take advantage of a second controller as of yet stated by Reggie, there is a need in case breaks and accidents happen to the ones that comes with it, so I just assume its due to production shortcomings. <p> I Could be wrong, but to the point ; I respect his comment none the less. <p> @T1p-T0e-Fan, while your counter argument is full of proper grammar, facts, and friendly speech, I never did even say which consoles I own or do not own, so I ca n't seem to grasp where your idea that I am a fanboy or hater came from. And like ParagonT said, just because they have sold out the pre-orders, does not mean they will sell 5.5 million systems by April. And futhermore, I was just stating from my opinion that I think most gamers out there want the companies to focus on the games, not just selling extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt the games in the long run. <p> I 'm not sure if you were including me in that remark, so sorry If I assume you did. I just want to re-organize my thought into a analogy for anyone. <p> If there was a lemonade stand that had just opened a day before, that only had 20 cups of lemonade that has recently sold out of them, does that necessarily mean it has an overall high demand? No of course not, they started with a low supply amount to begin with, so its artificial demand. The same can be said about Nintendo who are suspected for artificially creating the " Demand " by purposely lowering the supply to make its product seem more wanted. <p> Lets be real here ; those that has decided to purchase a Wii-U will wait until Nintendo resumes the supply to get one, no matter the time it takes, because there is no competition out as of yet. To be more clear, there is no competing console that will launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply in order to make sure they do not over produce their console, which saves money, because there is no competition for purchasers to turn to. Not only that, it increases the products popularity due to its rareness. <p> As I stated before I could be wrong, but I just think that Nintendo 's product does n't necessarily have an excessive high demand( not meaning it does n't have a demand at all) as people may think, its just that they have a low supply right now and they know this. I doubt it was an accident that this has happened, they have multiple analysts and professionals to make sure this sort of thing does n't happen. But hey, that 's just me. <p> Keep telling yourself that. Besides its a bit childish to compete over " who 's right " do n't you think? There does n't need to be someone who 's right and wrong you know. No need to act hard on a gaming site, over the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah, obviously you must work for Nintendo and are allowed access to all of their secured payrolls, production records, and are in well with all of the top brass. I 'm glad your able to tell who 's right or not. /sarcasm <p> As said above, there is no way for us to know, so yeah. No need to be a try hard. <p> It sucks that they 'll be taking a loss, but it seems like every company--no matter how big--never make enough money for themselves. Nintendo no doubt has billions of dollars in reserve, so a hundred or so million in losses probably wo n't cut them back for too long. <p> I 'll probably pick up a WiiU at one point, but not until some good games come out first. It really does n't have anything going for it to ween me off of my 360. Although mp is free, it does n't easily support voice. And it does n't have achievements so I wo n't get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). The promise of a new Zelda, Metroid, Smash Bros, and Mario Kart are all I can think of for the system right now. <p> wiiu 's objective isnt to " ween " you off of 360 wiiu is pizza when you get tired of mcdonalds or strawberry poptarts when you get tired of chocolate omg have you had the smores poptarts?( the trick is using
