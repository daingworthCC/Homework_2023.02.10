" <p> a) Thank God am still working. b) We 're not materialistic so we 're able to manage to save for rainy days. c) I just miss my family back home but since am married am going where my husband goes. d) Discrimination is inevitable no matter where a person goes. It 's just a matter of understanding why people think the way they do. e) My husband and I are still strong as a horse. f) Perhaps we have saved enough that we would like to live our lives. We 're still in our prime time but we certainly do n't want to become or wait for the time that we 're old and gray and unable to enjoy the fruit of our labor. Life is too short as they said. g) Political disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the flow. <p> We 're not yet in the Philippines as of now. It was a good decision for me because I have the opportunity to accomplish what I want in life in a short period of time and being able to share it with those who needed some extra help. <p> I gave up many things with less emotions that may affect me on my decisions in life. My decisions were not based on emotions but the feasibility and the result that at the end I would reap it. <p> We will eventually go back in the Philippines and stay there since my European husband prefers the tropical climate. <p> I did n't quit US life... LOL... Its more of a cultural experience for me. Anyways to answer your question : <p> A) This would make sense for people who are out of work or exhausted their unemployment insurance. Having a roof over your head in the Philippines is a lot better than waking up on the sidewalk. Plus too many Americans are moving into tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only apply to an OFW who 's family is back in the Philippines. If you were born in the USA then you might get homesick in the Philippines. But its not too bad. <p> D) Discrimination.... Well I lived and grew up in a WHITE neighborhood but I was n't treated that badly so..... NO <p> E) I do n't have any health issues to worry about. <p> F) How can Americans be overworked when they 're unemployed... LOL <p> G) If you agree that Obama is leading the USA into " Socialism "...... Thats what happens when Americans elect a Lying.... Non-Citizen.... Socialist Supporting..... " Not a real Brotha ".... Black Muslim Terrorist for President!!!! Should have put Ron Paul in the White House! <p> *What are you doing now in the Philippines? I 'm in the Philippines meeting lots of different people, going out dancing, going out to bars, going to the beaches. Also going to different provinces and other Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing now in the Philippines? Personally I 'm doing well in the Philippines. My parents own a home in a gated community so I 'm not in serious danger like other foreigner tourists walking around at night. <p> * Do you think, in hindsight, it was a good decision or a mistake? It was a GREAT decision.... I had the opportunity to live in the Philippines right after college..... I might not get an opportunity to travel like this again. I 've seen a lot of things about Filipino culture I 've never seen before. There are n't any Filipino museums in the US. Plus people here are a lot friendlier than I thought. Not to mention all of the millions of relatives who are eager to meet me! <p> *What did you have to give up to do so? I had to give up my life back home. I get homesick sometimes, no more baseball games, tailgate parties, and other " American Lifestyle " activities. Do I miss it? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in life
