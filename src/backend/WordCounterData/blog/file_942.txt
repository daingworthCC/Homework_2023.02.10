5203241 <p> As befits its name, Cetus, the whale or sea monster, is one of the largest constellations in the sky. It glides across the southern sky on November evenings. <p> Despite its size, though, Cetus is n't prominent, because like most autumn constellations, it lacks brilliant stars. Still, Cetus does boast one of the brightest red-giant stars in the heavens. <p> The star is known as Menkar or Alpha Ceti, and it shines in the whale 's head. A good star map can help you find the star and the rest of the constellation. <p> Menkar is about 250 light-years from Earth, so the light you see from the star tonight actually left its surface shortly before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Menkar was once a main-sequence star, so it generated energy as the Sun does -- by converting hydrogen into helium in its core. But the star burned up the hydrogen in its core, so it had to burn hydrogen in a thin layer around the core. This caused the star to expand. Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So the star turned yellow, then orange, and then finally red. Today, the star is a red giant -- a star that 's so large that if it were to take the Sun 's place in our own solar system, it would engulf the planet Mercury. <p> And in fact, Menkar gives us a preview of the Sun 's distant future. In several billion years, the Sun 's core will run out of hydrogen, and our star will slowly expand until it becomes a red giant -- just like Menkar. <p> Script by Ken Croswell, Copyright 2012 <h> Bookmark or share this page <p> For more skywatching tips, astronomy news, and much more, read StarDate magazine. <h> Keywords <h> Get Premium Audio <p> Listen to today 's episode of StarDate on the web the same day it airs in high-quality streaming audio without any extra ads or announcements.
