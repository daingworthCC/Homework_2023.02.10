5199641 <p> A $400,000 federal grant has opened the door to the future expansion of and improvements to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system. <p> Local politicians like U.S. senators Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez as well as Mayor Jerramiah Healy, Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer and others announced yesterday that the Federal Transit Administration will help New Jersey Transit study three potential improvements to the light rail system. <p> One of the new improvements, officials say, could be a new station in northern Jersey City which they say could accommodate and develop new housing and business opportunities. In a September interview with JCI, Daniel Gans of Hoboken Brownstone, the company behind a Jersey City Heights development slated to begin construction in 2013, alluded to the possibility of an 18th Street Light Rail Station. <p> Gans told JCI that a walkway planned to run between the Second Street Light Rail Station and a park that Hoboken Brownstone plans to build adjacent to Van Leer could someday run as far as Newport Green or the 18th Street station. An NJ Transit spokeswoman said at the time that while there had been discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no concrete plans to build one. <p> Officials say the grant may also be used to study the possibility of adding trains or tracks near Hoboken Terminal to ease a choke point in the system and also find potential solutions for easing traffic congestion near Paterson Plank Road between the Palisades and Hoboken, where light rail cars run along the street. <p> Since its construction, the HBLR has reached near capacity with more than 42,000 riders per day and connects Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, Union City and North Bergen through three light rail lines servicing 24 stations.
