5128441 <p> The folks over at Lazygamer had a hunch regarding using this game on a second PS3 system, and it turns out their worst fears were true. Sony Online Entertainment recently elaborated on how the game 's physical disc is tied to the user 's account : <p> Once the PSN key has been consumed with a disk it can not be resold/replayed with the second user adding a sub -- only the original consumer can use that acct... Disk and account are one. <p> You read that right, reselling this disc after activating the online key that it comes packaged with will turn the disc basically useless to anyone but the original key redeemer. This also includes other accounts on the same system, though a clarification has yet to be made regarding sub accounts on the original master PSN account. Is this the wrong direction for console MMOs to go? Does the second-hand market even hurt an MMO 's bottom line? Stay connected with
