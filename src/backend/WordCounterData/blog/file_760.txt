5184641 <h> 26 of the most stunning spots in Africa <p> With its expansive landscapes and formidable animal life, the world 's second-biggest continent is arguably the best for photographers. <p> Throw in that sense of being in a place that has n't changed for centuries and sometimes millennia, and you get some of the most inspiring, and inspired, spots on the planet. <h> 1. The great migration, Tanzania <p> It 's not the river they need to worry about. A photo wo n't capture the thunder of hooves on dirt as more than a million wildebeest and several hundred thousand zebra make their annual migration, but still, this is one for the top of the pile. <p> The migration is actually a year-round event as the animals move from Tanzania 's Ngorongoro Reserve in January, up through the Serengeti around June and hit Kenya 's Masai Mara around September, before journeying south again. <h> 3. Djmaa el Fna, Morocco <p> World 's most mesmerizing market. The world 's most exciting town square, Djmaa el Fna reminds you you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marrakech, snake-charmers, henna-painters, story-tellers, date-sellers and orange juice vendors set up their stalls in the sleepy heat of the afternoon. <p> As night falls, the vendors are joined by tribal drummers, ladyboy dancers and mobile restaurateurs selling delicious grilled meats, bread and salad as the smoke rises above their stalls till past midnight. <h> 6. Victoria Falls, Zambia and Zimbabwe <p> Liquid awesome. One of the world 's most majestic water spectacles, Victoria Falls( also called Mosi-oa-Tunya, or " The Cloud That Thunders) -- were reportedly first seen by a European when Scotsman David Livingstone journeyed here in 1855. <p> Since then thousands have enjoyed the spray from the 108-meter high cascade, which was once recorded flowing at 12,800 cubic meters per second -- double that of Niagara 's highest flow. <h> 8. Sahara dunes, Morocco <p> Whether you 're running it or gawking at it, you 'll be impressed. The most user-friendly part of the Sahara is accessible from the northern edge of Morocco. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or camp out in Tazzarine where runners from all over the world complete the week-long Marathon des Sables every spring. <p> The foot of the Merzouga Dunes is the ultimate location for star-gazing, totally free of light pollution. <h> 9. Pyramids of Giza, Egypt <p> And you thought building your garden wall was hard work. The most famous of the structures at Giza, near Cairo, the Pyramid of King Cheops was built around 2650 BC from 2.5 million blocks of limestone. <p> Its sides are oriented exactly to the north, south, east and west. <p> The Chephren pyramid, built by Cheops ' son, is similar in size and incorporates the entrances to a burial chamber which still contains the large granite sarcophagus of King Chephren. <p> The pyramid of Mycerinus is smaller than both and all three are surrounded by other smaller pyramids and dozens of tombs. <h> 10. Nyika Plateau National Park, Malawi <p> Malawi calling. Your dream escape awaits. Nyika, Malawi 's largest park, is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by numerous rivers that reach Lake Malawi by way of waterfalls off the eastern edge of the mountains. <p> The eastern border of the plateau forms the wall of the Great Rift Valley. <p> The great domes of hills have gentle slopes, making Nyika perfect for both trekking and mountain biking as well as Jeep exploration. <p> Antelope and zebra abound, and the park has one of the highest densities of leopard in Central Africa. <h> 11. Makgadikgadi Pans, Botswana <p> More salt than all the world 's microwave meals combined. It 's said you can hear your own blood flow in this vast area of dried-up salt pans in the Kalahari Desert, a forbidding landscaped formed by a huge lake that dried up millennia ago. <p> But it can transform in an instant during winter, if rains have been good enough to make lush grass sprout, bringing a stampede of wildlife to break the silence including zebra, wildebeest and flamingos. <h> 12. Draa Valley, Morocco <p> Never thought we 'd say this, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Between the Atlas Mountains and the dunes of the Sahara lies one of Morocco 's most splendid and rewarding landscapes : the Draa, a mass of date plantations punctuated by kasbahs made of rammed red earth rising against the sky. <p> Zagora, at the southern end, makes a good base with decent hotels and restaurants. Allow five hours to reach the Draa from Marrakech via a spectacular route across the Atlas mountains -- it 's best not to self-drive. <h> 13. Sphinx, Egypt <p> Not looking too shabby for nearly 9,000 years. This colossal temple is on the way down to Egypt 's Valley Temple of King Chefren. The body of a lion with a human head is a 70 meters long and 20 meters high -- as tall as a six-story apartment block. <p> Although the Sphinx has been thought of as female, many scholars believe the face is that of King Chefren. <h> 14. Mount Mulanje, Malawi <p> If the view 's good from down here, wait till you get up there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest mountain in central Africa. It 's split in two by the Fort Lister Gap, a broad pass eroded by the Phalombe and Sombani rivers. <p> The mountain is distinguished by giant basins of rock and narrow gullies cut by fast-flowing streams. A strenuous trek leads to magnificent viewpoints. <p> En route, expect to encounter monkeys, hares, voles and a carpet of enchanting wildflowers after the rain. Large numbers of butterflies are another feature. <h> 16. Wonders of the Nile, Egypt <p> The night is young, the Nile not so much. A cruise down the Egyptian Nile, ideally on a romantic felucca rather than a crowded tourist boat, reveals relics of one of the world 's most ancient civilisations. <p> The highpoint is the Valley of the Kings, with its monumental statues, and the magnificent Kom Ombo Temple, north of Aswan on the east bank. <h> 20. Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique <p> Whales, dolphin and dugong, oh my. The 10-minute helicopter ride across the Bazaruto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it in its own right. The destination is the icing on the cake. <p> This award-winning boutique hotel set on a remote desert island is set within a Marine National Park, giving the chance to see whales, dolphins and dugong. <h> 21. Nxia Pan National Park, Botswana <p> One thing we know -- Botswana is not short of sodium. The Baines Baobabs that sit close to the entrance of Botswana 's Nxai Pan National Park take their name from a series of watercolors by Victorian explorer and artist Thomas Baines. <p> Their fruit apparently tastes a little like sherbet. <p> The Nxai Pan park is great for viewing the vast, salt-rich pans that characterize the Kalahari and is also known for lion, leopard and cheetah and unusually large herds of giraffe. <h> 22. Fish River Canyon, Namibia <p> For all NASA knows, the Mars rover went off course and landed here. Some 500 meters deep and more than 160 kilometers long, this great rift is second only to the United States ' Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized by beautiful turquoise pools of seasonally-flowing water stretching into the distance. <h> 23. Rhinos at Solio Reserve, Kenya <p> No pots of gold in Kenya, just rhinos. Located in the valley between the dramatic slopes of Mount Kenya and the rolling peaks of the Aberdare Mountains, Solio Reserve is home to around 250 black and white rhino and considered the best place to see these increasingly rare species. <h> 24. Nyiragongo Volcano, Virunga National Park, Eastern Congo <p> Ca n't stand the heat? Get out of Africa. A whopping two kilometers wide and usually containing a lava lake, Nyiragongo Volcano is one of Africa 's most active volcanoes
