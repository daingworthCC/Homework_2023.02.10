" " They want to jam this through. " <p> Ryan was unstinting in heaping scorn on the health care legislation, arguing that it " is attempting to make health care more expensive, " and calling it a " deficit nightmare " filled with " smoke and mirrors and gimmicks. " <h> Share this Article <h> Reader Comments( 11) <h> Pages <p> 1 <p> Ryan got it right.The entire Summit performance was a show for Obama who dismissed, dodged and denied every individual critique of Obamacare.There was no dialogue... just posturing.The Dems will try to ram it through and take the hits later.So much for representative government. <p> If this bill goes to reconciliation, and if it ultimately contains an individual health insurance mandate, it will be challenged in the Supreme Court. If it does NOT contain an individual health insurance mandate, it will be unfunded and will cause bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, this bill is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Congress needs to begin again, and this time, it needs to listen to the voice of the people. <p> The Republicans want to jam the bill. The current health care system is a catastrophe that has happened. They helped create it and they will defend it. The bill IS bipartisan but the Republicans will not vote for it because they can not allow the Dems a victory. its classic party before country. <p> Ryan was the star of the show. The show was to display the pubs as arrogant know-nothings. Ryan was the best prepared speake in the room. All Obama could do is stare in horrified disbelief. A star is born. <p> The President called him on his lies about the CBO 's numbers and Ryan just repeated the same lie over again. I guess he thinks repeating the same lie over and over again makes it the truth, which is a time-tested success strategy with GOP voters., But Ryan has undernined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inept lack of control over his own Party 's message. The ignorant Party of NO! came thru loud and clear, and the American people will no longer stand for a do-nothing Congress like the one Ryan stands for. <p> Who writes the GOP talking points? Oh yeah, the democrats do n't want bipartisanship. Yeah, and the repunks do. No one believes this. Why do these talk show hosts allow this sort of drivel on their shows? <p> The Democrats have a bill they can pass. The Senate Bill can be passed by the House and then send to the President for his signature. Then there can be reconciliation for " side car " issues under the Byrd rules. Why has this not happened? Because the Stupak gruop knows that to pass the Senate bill as is means they have to adopt the abortion language in the Senate bill and can not change that language in reconciliation. Pelosi knows she can not pass the Senate Bill and that is why she has asked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely not. Stalemate-which is why we had the rediculous summit and why the Democrats have not yet acted. The abortion standoff is at least one provision that will not allow the bill to go forward and is the principal reason
