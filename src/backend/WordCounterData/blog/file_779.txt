5186641 <h> " Why 'd you have to go and make things so complicated? " <p> A seemingly innocuous comment sends someone over the edge. Immense drama is created out of thin air. We have all seen similar situations. <p> In fact, I have witnessed( and even played a part in) events that have ended up blown out of proportion to the extent that life-long friendships are ruined, families are torn apart, even jobs lost. <p> Someone makes a comment that rubs you the wrong way or an argument ensues after a misunderstanding.
