5164341 <h> The NYC Citibank Arrests, According To the OWS Videographer <p> A lot of people have watched the shocking video of people being locked into the LaGuardia Place Citibank branch while some thug undercover cop wrestled away a nice young lady in a business suit who was apparently arriving at her bank to close her checking account in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement. Meaghan Linick of Brooklyn is the #OWS activist who recorded the whole awful encounter on her Blackberry, and then put it online where it has already been seen a million times. Here 's Linick 's firsthand account of what happened, which she was kind enough to send to Wonkette. <p> By now, my cell phone video of two Citibank costumers being forcibly arrested outside the LaGuardia Place branch in New York City on October 15th 2011 has been seen by almost a million people. <p> As the person who unwittingly shot the video of the incident, I though it might be useful to respond to some of the media attention it has been getting. <p> A few friends and I attended a rally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington Square Park, which was connected to the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests in lower Manhattan -- and now around the country and around the world. <p> After the rally, I went into a nearby coffee shop and when I returned to the park I heard that a few dozen people had decided to head over to the local Citibank branch to talk about their student debt and close their accounts. I thought one of my friends might be among them so I walked the few blocks to the bank. <p> As I arrived I saw Citi Bank security guards locking the doors to the bank. <p> Contrary to the City Bank PR statement, the cops were not yet on the scene when Citi Bank officials chose to lock the doors to the branch -- effectively kidnapping those inside. <p> Since I could see my friends were still inside the bank, I took out my blackberry and began recording through the window. <p> As I filmed an undercover, plain clothes police officer approached a women standing next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inside the bank and said she had to come with him. As you can see on the video she repeats over and over, " I 'm a customer, " and she holds up her Citibank check book. Though it 's not audible on the video, she also told him that she was just trying to close her account. <p> As my voice in the video will testify I was shocked and shaken by what happened next. The women, and the man standing next to her, were dragged inside the bank through a side door and arrested allow with 22 other people who were locked inside. <p> I watched in horror from the sidewalk as police dragged each person out one by one and loaded them into a line of paddy wagons. I could see that a few people were bleeding from their wrists where the police zip ties were cutting them. <p> I did not know the woman or man being arrested by the undercover cop in my video, but I desperately wanted to find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases. <p> Today, I went down to Central Booking in Manhattan for the arraignments of the 24 people arrested. They were in jail for almost 30 hours. Most were charged with disorderly conduct, but a few have more serious charges -- including trespassing and resisting arrest. <p> After waiting four hours in the courtroom they were finally released, along with my other friends. Their hands and wrists were cut up from the roughness of the police and zip ties. Everyone who was in jail was tired, hungry, and mentally and emotionally exhausted from spending the night in a cell -- but no one was deterred from participating in the Occupy movement. <p> I asked my friends what had happened inside and they told me that they had all agreed they would leave the bank when asked. That no one had had any interest in being arrested that day. They all had thought, as citizens and as Citibank customers, they would be given a chance to leave the branch before action was taken against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underemployed recent college graduate with a degree in economics( of all things) and like many in my generation I have over $50,000 in student loans. I 'm currently working as a babysitter to try and pay the bills. <p> This is why I organize with Occupy Wall Street. Because I am part of the 99% -- and if you 're reading this, there 's a 99% chance that you are too! The most beautiful thing about the Occupy Movement is that we can create, on a small scale, a version of the society in which we would like to live. A society with free education and health care -- where democracy is participatory and real and our social relationships are founded on community, mutual aid, equality, respect, and solidarity. <p> If you believe that what is happening in this country is wrong, if you believe that as a society we can do better than this, then find an Occupy event in your city or town! And remember to bring your cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm an underemployed recent college graduate with a degree in economics( of all things) Well, *I* can think of a position in which Meaghan Linick would do a better job than the current occupant : http : **34;8003;TOOLONG.... Watch your back, Timmy! <p> I agree, although, as my comment above.... would he? I do want big clanging balls.... I go back, sometimes, to how he treated Lieberman after the election( i.e. treated him well.) WTF? I 'm all for peace love and unicorns, but was any hard politicking done to ensure passage of key bills after this shithead campaigned for someone else? The first year when we had " majorities "( not really) kinda made me wonder how much pressure would be applied to those on the fence. <p> Yeah, " not-really majorities " is the key. We forget that the Blue Dog Democrates undermined Obama at every turn in those first 2 years, and it was n't a " given " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to make them pay. Actually, that was supposed to be Rahm Emmanuel 's job, at which he was a failure. <p> He has learned the hard way that putting yourself out in the front ranks with yelling and screaming does n't necessarily achieve the goals you want. I did that too in my yoof -- I had all these causes I fought for, and I was always ready to be on the frontlines. Eventually, you realize that while you 're out there making noise, the Enemy is in the backroom working hard to negate everything you think you 've achieved. Even as the people marching behind you sink their knives into your back. <p> Like it or not, politics requires a shrewd appraisal of the goals. Talking the talk is great. The problem is, we want our poor President to play both roles simultaneously. The guy 's a wonk, a geek, like a lot of us here. He 's uncomfortable with people, even if he does have a bucketload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious thinker who works hard, but does n't like to play the role of demagogue. <p> And I do n't blame him. When you 're out there demagoguing, the RWNJs can draw a bead on you much easier. We lost many of our ' 60s struggle icons to assassins. And the man gets around 400 death threats PER FUCKING DAY. <p>( EDIT : **31;8039;TOOLONG. This is a metaphorical gas mask. I came of age in the late 1970s, and have my own SDS envy... I did participate in a " Die-In " to support the Nuclear Freeze thing in the early 80 's. On the other hand, while I did in fact belong to a Sanctuary Movement church, I never actually smuggled Salvadorans) <p> Seriously? That threat only makes sense if the Repubs nominate a Perry or Bachmann. The space between Obama and Romney, on the other hand, is n't large enough to drag the disillusioned Democratic base voters -- me, for instance -- out in force. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party in the upcoming election. If there 's no difference between Romney and O for you... may I remind you of 2000. Would we be in Iraq? Given the tax breaks to the wealthy? Appointed Alito and Roberts? Uhhh.... big difference between O and Romney, even when I 'm at my most perturbed and disappointed. <p> So true. Sure wish Al Gore had fought harder. Just think of all the people who 'd still be alive or have their limbs if Bush the Lesser had never gotten the keys to the WH from the so-called Supreme Court. <p> Yeah, but the reliance on the boogeyman of " It could always be worse " as the party keeps on nominating increasingly conservative Democratic machine politicians in the service of the banks, big corporations and the wealthiest Americans is n't going to work forever. At some point, it will become easier to make the case that the centrist Democrats are the ones who elected Bush, due to their failure to vote for Nader. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first ; now it 's just annoying. <p> This thing is n't about Obama, the office of the presidency, or any other singular political figure or position for that matter so quit the bullshit, single-minded, Obama trolling, already. Hell, I 'm not even much a fan of the president, but this is getting fucking old. <p> And Negropolis, you are wrong. It 's not single minded Obama trolling. You misunderstand. <p> Do you think if the President made it clear to the officials at the SEC that he wanted them to stop Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and others from looking at all of the trades before they are made, and jumping in front of them, and guaranteeing unending massive profits at my expense, do you think he could put a stop to it? Or tell the NYSE to stop being bribed, billions of dollars by the above mentioned, for giving them space next to the exchange specifically so that they can do the above? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop to that if he wanted? Me, too. And do n't act like I am the only one that has accused him of being Goldman 's poodle. Wall Street corruption is ruining this country. He is in a position to try, at least, to stop them. So far, he has done nothing. Is he with the people, or is he lead blocking for Wall Street? My post suggested that we will find out soon, because public outrage will cause him to have to choose. These are reasonable questions, reasonable concerns, reasonable points. You saying that this is not about him is ridiculous. He is the only one on earth with the power to either stop them, or at least try to stop them. <p> Bottom line : I voted for Barack. I sent him money. I am greatly disappointed. I will criticize him when I see fit. Get used to it, or get over it. I want better from him. I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cause him to toughen up. You, on the other hand, are apparently satisfied. God bless you. We disagree. If you are annoyed by my frequent criticism, sorry. <p> And it has not escaped me that the two guys that are up my ass the hardest, are you and Chet. Should I not make anything of that? Coincidence? <p> The water fountain at the kid 's elementary school still does not refrigerate the water to a safe and tasty 42 degrees. I wrote to Obama about this over a year ago, and nothing, NOTHING, has been done about it. Now I have no choice but to vote for Herman Cain. I mean, it 's the principle of the thing. <p> I expect more from him. Being more benign than the Republicans is not OK with me, and it should not be with you, either. Are our standards so low? I believe that he has the power to stop Wall Street from robbing us blind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? If so, please, please stop apologizing for him. I want him to be a Democrat, not a collaborator. <p> You want to keep having this argument, that all of our problems would be solved if Obama just " stood up " and did everything differently? <p> Every time I ask one of you guys who think Obama Is The Entire Problem how he is supposed to magically accomplish what you want without control of Congress, I never get ANY kind of answer except a variation of, " well, I would feel better that he put on a show for me. " <p> As Deval Patrick wrote, Grover Norquist said 8 years ago that his goal was a permanent Republican majority. Somebody pushed back that, eventually, the Democrats would get back into the White House. Norquist said " we will make it so that a Democrat can not govern as a Democrat. " http : **35;8072;TOOLONG.... <p> THAT 'S why we 're in the situation we have right now, not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you campaign permanently to control Congress, you also control the Presidency. What 's really pathetic is that we seem to have nobody on the Left who appears to be as smart as Grover Norquist. <p> As for Obama, you get no coverage on Wonkette about what Obama is actually trying to accomplish : going out on tour giving the poutragers the red meat they 've been clamoring for, and exposing Republicans and their votes on the record so that SOMEBODY in their districts or states might take them on at the ballot box. So I guess I 'm not surprised that some people want to rehash their rants from December or June or whenever. <p> Meanwhile, I will keep posting my weekly question, until I see or hear someone taking it seriously : How will the Left get back control of Congress, and keep it, regardless of who 's in the White House? <p> See, Biely cold knows these people and what 's in those shriveled black pockets they have where their hearts used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless asshole. Someone has to pay the mortgage and buy the cheezbrgrs that make Grover 's fat ass quite so fat. And you can tell from his svelte figure that the man ai n't hurtin '. The problem is, the 1% has all the money. We 're only just starting to realize that, are n't we? <p> " What 's really pathetic is that we seem to have nobody on the Left who appears to be as smart as Grover Norquist. " <p> I 'm not sure I 'm prepared to agree. I think we have plenty of smart folks on the left. I think we have nobody on the left who is as *ruthless* as Grover Norquist -- or, for that matter, as Karl Rove -- which would lead us to the whole " sinking to their level " issue that I do n't think has ever been fully resolved on Wonkette( or anywhere else). <p> Well, Democrats are apparently afraid of power until someone else has it, so what the fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have it, they 're so afraid of making a god damned mistake they do n't defend themselves. I say start by giving your idea a body count and work backwards. If Dems fuck up and, say, 50000 civilians get deaded, then who give a shit, we got a country to run. Any more than that, then fine, it 's someone else 's turn for a while. <p> I guess I 'm one of " you guys ". I 'm a little disappointed that you think my answers have been equivalent to " well, I would feel better that he put on a show for me ", but that is my problem. It is my job to get my points across. Let me try again. <p> It is indisputable that President Obama has never enjoyed a " filibuster-proof " majority in Congress. OTOH, no President has had a filibuster-proof majority during my lifetime, and yet right-leaning Presidents have managed to move the political " center " of the country several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this without filibuster-proof majorities. <p> I know, that 's not specific. Concede me a paragraph of generality. What could the President have done to " magically accomplish what I want "? <p> 1. Refuse to accept the watered-down, tax-break-heavy ARRA. It was never going to work in its neutered form, so why the fuck should you become identified with it? I understand that the Administration wanted to be seen as trying to do something, but it was obvious at the time that the something would be fail. Now, the President is tainted with the fail. <p> 2. Veto the extension of the PATRIOT ACT. The whole act is a " magical " suspension of civil rights, and the longer it is in force, the more permanent our loss of civil rights will be. <p> 3. Refuse the " negotiated settlement " at the end of 2010. I understand that not extending unemployment benefits would have caused significant pain to many who did n't deserve the pain, but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush/( Obama) tax cuts would be old news. <p> 4. Get. The. Fuck. Out. Of. Afghanistan. Now. I admit, this is a purely US-centric opinion. Undoubtedly, the Taliban deserves to be exterminated. But this is beyond our capability, unless we nuke the whole area. Spend the whatever hundreds of fucking billions a year on border anti-terrorist measures like cargo scanning, where we do n't spend shit now. <p> And in response to your weekly question, the Left will never get back control of Congress, because the " Left " has never had control of Congress. The US has been blessed by nature to such a degree that the majority of folks have had, so far, pretty good lives, and can ignore the minority who have not. I 'm not happy about this, but I like to think of myself as a realist. The occasional jerks in the progressive direction we 've had over the past few decades have occurred when a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hope that the opportunity will arise in President Obama 's second term. <p> Citibank will now add another $100 to every debit card transaction to cover the cost of arresting customers. For their leadership, everyone at the position of vice prez and up gets another bonus. Good work, bailout boys. Guess whose credit card offers I 'm cutting up in tiny pieces and mailing back? <p> How many years would we spend in jail for locking a Citibank exec in a room for even thirty seconds? But, you see, that 's because we are the 99% of Americans who do n't get to have the judicial and law enforcement system cheerfully swallowing our every random spooge. <p> This is where The People 's Army comes in. Be sure to mention this to all your colleagues in the office, random people on the street, friends, relatives, neighbours. Do it in a casual way, sort of a " Hey, did you hear that Citibank.... " <p> Pretty soon, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruing the day. <p> Funny story -- I left B of A many years ago, before they had reached their current level of evil. The tipping point was when they made a " clerical error " -- some teller processed my paycheck as a withdrawal, so I went under balance. In the process, I amassed a pile of fees, fees for not having funds to pay the fees, and fees to process the fees. Mind you, I did n't do anything wrong -- this was a damn ATM deposit, and I did it correctly -- this was entirely their fault. <p> I remember having my fourth or fifth long discussion trying to get the bank to clear out the piles of fees. The manager kept insisting that there was nothing he could do, and it was obviously my fault. I should have kept an extra month or two worth of pay in my checking account to cover for their mistakes. I kept raising my voice so more customers waiting in line could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Those BofA fuckers bought my mortgage a few years ago and changed the due date rather covertly. It took me half a day in a branch and hours on-line to get it straightened out. They made it look like a clerical error, but after talking to a few friends and investigating online we realized this was a systemic plan on their part to extract a few hundred bucks out of all their mortgages. Just another ugly facet of capitalism. A letter to Senator Jim Webb,( D) VA, yielded no response. <p> Bank of America deserves a lot of the credit for tipping the switch to ' ON " for moving accounts out of big banks. Their idiotic greedy monthly fee focused the issue for many people. To think Gianinni started it as a place for small account immigrants to use to pursue the American Dream, just look at what the MBAs have done to it and you have the whole story on the decline of that dream. Nice work, assholes. <p> Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't using, but paying off with a monthly deduction from my checking account. I made the mistake of not looking at the statements because a) I knew the card was in my possession b) I was n't using it and c) I had $400 a month going directly to B of A. After several months I actually looked at a statement and discovered that they had arbitrarily changed my due date. I ended up incurring several months of late fees and an increase in my interest rate. I never protested since I really should have opened my statements, but still. Paid off and closed that sucker as soon as I could. <p> I was trying to legally close out accounts of my mom's- the bank( not BOA but crooks, too) kept changing what I needed. I finally called one day and spoke to the manager and asked her to list for me exactly what was needed. I drove over to the bank with everything right after the call, got there and then when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me now more items were needed. I loudly told everyone that the bank was dishonest and a rip-off and that the employees were liars. <p> Three yeas ago when I had the bank take nearly two thousand dollars out of my savings account to pay a perfect stranger 's car insurance after a few hilarious months I idly typed in, I hate Citibank and boy oh boy was I not surprised! BTW there is also I hate Chase Bank, I hate Wells Fargo, etc. <p> I watched in horror from the sidewalk as police dragged each person out one by one and loaded them into a line of paddy wagons. <p> Not to belittle the injustice of the situation, but ' watched in horror '? Disbelief or anger, maybe. But hold back on the ' horror ', kid, unless you 're watching Syrian government handiwork, a moot jaws-of-life extrication or footage of Dick Cheney. <p> Well, that 's why the hyperbole. After you 've seen cops or riot pigs beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, better yet, actually witnessed a killing or two up close and personal, you reserve " horror " for when you get your own ass tossed in jail after a thorough beating. They 're young. They have n't seen much yet, but they have courage, and they 'll be seeing plenty soon. <p> I 'm with the woman. Watching someone physically dragged off a public sidewalk into an establishment so that they can frame you is pretty horrifying, and is something you 'd expect of some third world banana republic. The police do n't have to be firing into a crowd for their actions to elicit horror. Everything is always relative to something else. The argument reminds me of the one where someone in American poverty is told not to complain because he or she lives better relative to someone in poverty in Africa. <p> Easy there, U-of-O. She told us her degree was in economics, not journimalism. It 's probably truly horrifying to econ majors to see actual physical force( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their places of worship. <p> I remember back in the 60s( when I was, actually, about 6) that people would send bricks with the pre-paid address label( from the gov't or some corporation). I wonder if this would still work. Could we send bricks to the pre-approved credit card section of Chase? Cuz that would be awesome. <p> Yeah, and I do n't.( No, I 'm not gon na act like those fucking RWNJs who think that 's a reason to take away medical care from the incarcerated. I just wish they 'd give those of us on the outside some care, at least.) <p> Well, you do n't have the throw the bricks through the window or anything -- just take a brick and wrap it in brown paper. Then take one of the reply envelopes they include in those offers( the one that says " postage paid ") and tape it to that brick. Then mail it off and Citi( or Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postage. <p> Not a huge thing for them if a few folks do it. But if tens of thousands do...? <p> Better hurry! They 're about to snuff the Postal Service. It 's not in the interests of the Ruling Class to have the Poors able to mail stuff at modest cost. How 's the private sector supposed to make any money on that? <p> Maybe Erick Erickson and the other retards at Red State can find some pictures of non-whites from Google and post stories about how they are the " 53% that can not close their accounts and are forced to do business with Citi or go to jail " and how awesome that is. <p> I think from now on every time a post has OWS in it, everyone should give me a thumbs up because it 's so close to OWLS. If every single commenter does this, I 'll be happy and I might even catch up with Barb by 2013 or so. <p> I will say that when I contacted them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly, and were incredibly helpful, courteous, and friendly, even though I *definitely* was n't. Having chewed out the long-suffering person on the other end of my request, I then discovered I was speaking to the CEO. I suggest you contact them and ask if they can include a permalink feature. I 'm sure you 'll find them just as responsive as I did. <p> We 're doing an Air Force-wide project to get a good inventory of Oil-Water Separators at all stateside AF bases past and present, so we can go in and evaluate whether there have been releases needing cleanup. So, every time I get an email from some major or colonel about the OWS project, I give a mental upfist to User of Owls. <p> Not to raise false hopes or anything, but I 'll bet that the award in the class-action civil suit against CitiBank will cause higher management to review it 's executive bonuses at this particular branch with an eye to cost-containment. <p> Really? Really, Dude or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there, hired by banks or Kochs? You do n't believe that the FBI infiltrated the Civil Rights Movement? Sorry, have n't seen that debunked. Did you read that interview? <p> Hmm, point taken. I really should read links before I comment upon them. <p> In answer to your questions( assuming that they were n't rhetorical), I would be not at all surprised if there were agents provocateurs among the OWS folks, if for no other reason than there 's nothing I would put past the Kochs/banks. <p> Neither would I be surprised to find out that the FBI infiltrated the Civil Rights Movement, especially given how much J. Edgar hated MLK and would have done anything to discredit him. <p> What I was referring to/mocking was the attitude of the good ol ' boys who said the Civil Rights marches and sit-ins were the product of " outside agitators ", because " our darkies are happy with things the way they are ". <p> I 'm still at BofA while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my employer, so I 'm exempt from the usual fees associated with someone who lives paycheck to paycheck. While I 'm looking around at credit unions, I go into the bank every payday and withdraw everything in the account, except for what covers the automatic billpay accounts, + a couple bucks. I might just keep it up after I switch, just to suck up bits of bandwidth when they have to send that fun " your account is less than $25 " alerts. Micropennies on the dollar, but that 's how they 're destroying America. <p> I 've been through this exact same scenario with Wells Fargo. This is how it goes. They charge you a fee on your below-acceptable-level bank balance, and take that money immediately. If the balance in your account is too low to cover their fee, they notify you, but continue to ADD FEES. Eventually, you end up owing them several hundred dollars in fees, whereupon they turn your account over to a collection agency, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats. Depending on whether your state has good consumer protections, they might put out an APB on you. Several people have found themselves in jail over a weekend because they owe some ridiculously tiny amount on a long-defunct or disputed bill. <p> If you want to do something, run it by your local Lawyers ' Guild, if they even exist anymore and are n't all out at the protests. You could get into WAY more trouble than you think. Corporate America will take its pound of flesh, if it has to remove it with its own teeth. <p> Edited to add : The collection agency has a tame lawyer or two on call who WILL take your case to court, by the bye. If you 're a no-show, the judge automatically finds for the other party, and your " default " becomes a matter of public record. <p> Sad modern version : George Bailey waives his pistol at the crowd and yells " Which one of you motherfuckers wants to get his wings first? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your damned pockets and shut up. " <p> Thats the most shocking part of the video, to me, that they blatantly took the woman back towards the doors of the bank off the sidewalk. That was absolutely chilling. I do n't know what that was, but what I know was that it ai n't legal, that 's for damned sure. <p> Yes, the ACLU and the NLG are there, and it should be relatively quick to get those charges tossed. The fact that they physically took the woman into custody constitutes a false arrest and she probably also has excellent grounds to sue for assault and battery and a slew of other things as well. <p> I so hope these miserable fucking bastards eat shit and die for what they have done. Not content with stealing all our money, they want to steal our very lives. Bastards! <p> I do n't know what the NY statutes specify as elements of a kidnapping offense, but it would be delightful to see her heave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In possibly-related news, the Village Voice is reporting that Fat Cop Tony Baloney will lose ten days ' vacation for pepper-spraying those two young ladies. I urge everyone to contact NYPD AND Bloomberg and demand the fucker be fired instead. He draws $154K annual salary, so his pension benefits, etc., must be HUGE. Kick him off the force, blacklist him around the nation, and go after his pension/savings for damages. God knows there 's PLENTY of evidence. <p> FBI agents arrested a New York City police officer this morning and charged him with gross civil rights violations for deliberately falsifying an arrest against a black man and later referring to the incident on a wiretapped call by saying that he had " fried another nigger, " officials said. <p> The incident began when Michael Daragjati, an eight-year NYPD veteran, stopped the man in the Stapleton neighborhood of Staten Island on the evening of April 15, the feds say. <p> Brooklyn federal prosecutors say that Daragjati, 32, frisked the man, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after the man complained about his treatment during the street encounter, Daragjati placed him under arrest without probable cause, prosecutors say. <p> Daragjati then filed a police report in Richmond County Criminal Court that falsely claimed the man had " flailed his arms and kicked his legs during the arrest, " prosecutors say, allowing the officer to charge the man with resisting arrest. <p>... <p> On the same day that he filed the false report, investigators secretly intercepted several phone calls that Daragjati made and overheard him use racist epithets on several occasions to refer to black people, officials said. <p> In one of the calls, Daragjati acknowledged that he could be terminated from the NYPD if the department discovered that he would at times " throw somebody a beating, " prosecutors say in court documents. <p> I think " gross " is an appropriate term, here. This is n't some old-school racist ; this is my generation. <p> I do n't know whether to be mostly disgusted by that cop, encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or suspicious that there 's tons more like him who are n't quite so stupid as to be flagrant about it.. <p> Oh, like Daragjati wo n't cold beat the shit out of Cain before the elections! He 'll probably arrest him for pretending to be human. Not that he 's wrong about that, but it wo n't be based on Cain 's despicable politics, which is the truly sad thing. <p> This is was typical 30 years ago and still is. A black man in a white neighborhood -- Staten Island -- gets harassed by the police for the nth time. He not only is n't breaking any laws or causing trouble, he might well not have a choice to be there or not -- on his way home from work, for example. <p> If he says or does anything that shows he is sick of being tormented yet again by the police he is arrested or knocked around. Or both. <p> I grew up in a cop family on the south side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine what someone who gets targeted by them constantly thinks. <p> Thank you. It 's pretty much a death sentence letting those bastards know just what you think of them for mistreating you YET AGAIN. The ones that threw me in a black Maria told me that I should stop asking them where they were taking me " ' cause where we 're takin ' you, you ai n't comin ' back. And if you do n't shut up right now, I guess we 're just gon na get there a little faster. " <p> Edited to add : The reason I took their threat seriously : a week before, an Asian woman from the local U had " disappeared " -- and despite a massive manhunt, no trace of her had been found. I was new in town, had few friends. They could have " disappeared " me very easily. <p> They always make sure to write you up for resisting arrest, too, and they know how to tighten those twist-tie plastic handcuff thingies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they finally take them off. <p> I know you are snarking, but I have to say that I personally know 3 judges who would n't put up with that crap( in Colorado). I think there is at least a chance of getting a decent judge in NY, and with that video made public and all they ca n't hide it now. <p> So this means that -- since corporations are people and therefore the converse is also true -- whenever Citibank conducts itself in a manner that I consider threatening, I can call the cops and have them rounded up and thrown in jail for the weekend, right? Okay, I 'm gon na be on the phone for the next 48 hours or more. <p> When May 21 came and went without fanfare, end-of-the-world cheerleader Harold Camping was forced to revise his story. The " earthquakes " he had predicted did occur, he writes on his website in a post titled " What Happened on May 21? " -- only instead of shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one was raptured because God decided not to do it. Camping writes : " What really happened this past May 21st? What really happened is that God accomplished exactly what He wanted to happen. " <p> Well, yes : whatever the hell happens, it 's got ta be what Harold 's all-powerful God wants to happen. I mean, what else could possibly happen -- the Big Guy is all-powerful, doh! Brain-hurting logic points for Camping there, but I 'm taking bets on what his doomsday schedule looks like on October 22. If he were smart, he 'd pick a date likely to arrive well after he 's dead, but we know he ai n't all that smart, so.... what 's the new date going to be? Twenty-first of what month? <p> I b'leev the Old Toad has already settled on the 21st of THIS very month as the date of the impending Rapture. Apparently, God has a fixation with the number 3. Or 21. Or whatever. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for him to die and discover that it was Cthulhu he was worshipping, all along. <p> I 'm thinking today is a good day to go close the checking account at the conspiracy bank. There 's only $1.58 in there anyway. Fuck the phone also. Under contract for another year. Hopefully they wo n't shake us down too bad in the meantime. After that, we shall do without. <p> People people people! Do the math before you sign one of those idiot cell phone contracts. If you buy the phone outright, your monthly subscription fee is lower enough you 'll save the difference on the price of the phone in 15 months. And you wo n't be locked into a contract the whole time. <p> Aye! No wonder these companies screw the masses over so easily. No one is thinking. <p> The swells, the 53 's and the police are waiting for everyone to go home to their parent 's house when winter comes. Haha, big laffs for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter is springtime in an election year. A summer of political conventions and bus tours. We 're not going away. <p> Haha, bigger laffs : most of us do n't have a home to go home to anyway. And if Romney has his way, whoever 's still got a house will get kicked out of it right soon, and be allowed to " rent " it back from our corporate masters, if we 're lackey, erm, lucky. I ca n't wait to see new renter regulations allowing landlords to kick out tenants who engage in political activism. <p> What the FUCK? This has gone on long enough. Who 's got Bloomberg 's cellie number? Because we need to be calling that motherfucker late at night while he 's humping that lady who OWNS fucking Zucotti Park. I hate these people SO much. <p> I 'm thinking of moving our accounts from USbank( I think that 's what they 're named this week, have to check) to a local bank or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of National Security Letters automatic? Or do I have to fill out more paperwork? <p> That, and the idea of getting roughed up and spending 30 hours in jail on some sort of vague audacity charge( the law still being uncertain in that area, but I 'm absolutely sure the SCOTUS will come down on the side of the banks since the question before the court is " Which of the two parties in this dispute has the most pull? "). Still, these days, the bigger the bank, the more reason to move your money. <p> It 's your money to do with as you see fit, and I actually did close my Bank of America account long ago, because they 're annoying and crappy -- but I should point out that US Bank is one of the better( at least relatively speaking) banks ; among other things, they paid back the bailout money promptly. <p> Excellent plot twist Citibank. Your rework of " Dog Day Afternoon " is refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rape of the everyman by large banking interests belongs among the pantheon of films with a conscious. BTW the comic use of the chubby cop toward the end of the film. Genius! His pants nearly falling down, his clear panic and the way he holds his baton as if his life has been a misdirect, he should have been on the stage. He coulda been a hoofer! Oh I 'm singing in the rain..... <p> Let us not criticize Ms. Linick for her journalistic style. Let us instead encourage her and others to continue to record and report such occurances. Who really cares how it is written as long as it is written or otherwise recorded and reported. <p> It 's back to swamp twittering @Whitehouse with pleas to send in troops to protect American citizens from the NYPD Gestapo. If Barry can send troops to Uganda he can send troops to protect OWS protesters in cities around the country. Barry has no problem looking for a fight globally, he could have his fight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel. Ike did it in Little Rock. Hey that 's the new catch phrase ; ' Be Like Ike '! Off to twitter. <p> I get junk mail about every other day from CitiBank, BEGGING me to apply for a credit card. Instead of just ripping the next one up and throwing it into the recycle bin, I 'm trying to think of a more... direct, to-the-point response. Nothing bad, just something along the lines of stuffing a bunch of junk mail ads into the postage-paid return envelope and sending it off to them. Ha ha, THAT 'll show ' em! Any ideas? <p> But, yeah, I guess I 'm not OK with him standing by, and watching, letting them loot the country. And he does n't have to be some fantasy cartoon character to do the right thing and oppose these guys, now that the public is actively behind the effort. <p> The banks bought up a goodly number of foreclosed houses in Detroit, after evicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in, I can only assume that they 're giving away the houses as prizes to those who have incurred their disfavor. <p> He put Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor on the Supremes. If nothing else, the irritant value of those two appointments ALONE ought to leave all of us profoundly grateful. <p> Do you think Mitt Romney will be as beneficial to the nation and its people? Take, for example, women -- Romney feels it is his DUTY as a Bishop of the Mormon cult, to tell pregnant women that they 're " getting off easy " if they do n't carry life-threatening pregnancies to term, regardless of how many other children they might have who will be adversely affected. And, of course, regardless of their possibly dying as a result. As cunts, they have no rights that need to be respected, of course, especially not if those cunts are owned by a man. <p> Good grief. The " centrist Democrats " should have voted for fucking Nader? I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fucking egomaniac trial lawyer, NOT a potential President. The guy has a long history of wanting to be in the spotlight and loving it. He 's not known for his diplomacy, courteousness, humility, consideration, or any of those other qualities that we *ought* to want in a President. Besides, for Christ 's sake, the " centrist Democrats " are your grandparents who piss their beds everytime they see a black guy. Yeah, THEY 'RE gon na vote for Nader or the Greens! That 'll happen. <p> It is no " bogeyman " of it could always be worse. It WAS worse, it COULD be worse, still. STILL. Sorry, I was old enough to know how bad voting for fucking Nader was, and I 'm plenty wise enough to know that thousands are dead because of false reasoning such as this. <p> Nader was, and is, a fucking douchnozzle. He did great work for safety, for the " little guy, " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be president. <p> I 'm old enough to 've voted for Bernie Sanders in his first Congressional campaign, back when he was still registered as a Socialist, so yeah, I 've got the background here too. And the problem with the argument you 're putting out is that Obama has turned out to be a guy I 'd never, ever want to be the President. I mean, how many thousands have died in those same Bush wars since O took over the office? Where 'd our civil liberties go? Is Gitmo closed yet? Obama is effectively the moderate Republican that no longer exists within that party. <p> Interesting meeting last night. Meetings in general tend to be like book clubs anyway, but this one even more so. There 's been a fellow there the last couple weeks in from Guatemala, vacationing in our town( which does n't even begin to make sense ; nobody vacations here). Does n't speak a lick of English, which does n't really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and most of the meaning of what he says is carried in his inflection, universal language of such-and-such, our common humanity, etc, and we all manage to understand each other. <p> Anyhoo, last night he was talking about something and I made out the words la dialctica marxista, and naturally my ears perked up. Others noticed, too, and eventually the conversation turned to alcoholismo dialctica and the interior mental processes that attend to recovery. Not bad for a small town and a guy from Guatemala. <p> Thank you. Some of our peers here seem to think that we should be satisfied no matter how ineffective Obama is. My original overriding point was that we must expect better from him. He must lead. We should n't cut him a free pass because he is a little better than the Republicans. That 's not what any of us signed on for when we voted for him. These times do NOT call for going along and getting along. <p> Ok, now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of tourism destination you note. To wit : -- Is it terribly common for someone to go to a meeting while they 're on vacation? In another country? Where they do n't even speak the language? -- As a rule, the pool of Guatemalans who can afford to take multi-week vacations in the US is rather limited, socioeconomically speaking. And among members of this particular demographic, the only time you 're likely to hear someone use the phrase ' Marxist dialectics ' is if it is immediately followed by, ' poses such a mortal threat that it would be wise to go on a genocidal rampage against poor Mayans... just in case. ' -- And book club?? There 's no way that... ok, maybe that 's not so weird. But the other stuff, dat 's jus whack man! <p> I did like it. Genuinely oddball... like you! Been awhile since we had a checkup tryst in the no-tell motel comments, how 's it going amigo? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Dame Owls will be gone for a week. My loins are girded and my schedule is so crammed that I 'll be too damn tired to drink! Seriously, I 'm looking forward to it and feel ready. Sending un abrazo... <p> It turns out that safety net of family and familiar turf are EXTREMELY critical. You 'll notice that my fuck-up occurred when I was( a) in unfamiliar territory and( b) alone, separated from my family. Since then, I survived a week of Mrs Dewey 's absence without incident, largely because I adopted the strategy you seem to have chosen. Of course, my little " higher power " helped me out a lot ; she was helping me to keep my " eye on the prize ". <p> Things are going well, here. I 'm finishing up my last semester of one-class-at-a-time grad school, thesis in the spring. I seriously doubt that I would have been able to finish the workload in this last academic term if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a shame to throw away 4 years of studying ' cause I could n't stay awake past 8:30pm to finish my coursework. Cheer for " Master of Science " Dewey -- I sure look forward to donning that fake velvet hood on graduation day! <p> Yay!! Felicitaciones( un poco prematura pero no importa porque tengo fe!) mi colega ilustre! On many, many levels you make all those who care for you immensely proud. It 's wonderful that you 'll soon have very tangible proof of what you( we) can accomplish now that we almost certainly could not have before. In my mind 's eye, I can already see the excitement and fidgetation of wee Susie as she waits to see Dad march to the podium in his fake velvet hood. And Mrs. Dewey, in my imagination, will be struggling to hold back tears of happiness, pride and peacefulness. Way to go friend, way to go. <p> So, what does an Owl plan for his activity while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Knitting club? Extra rounds of tutoring for the freshmen? And how has the return of Mrs Owls been going? Hopefully you have friends there who know/understand what you are going through and have safe activities to offer. <p> Are you anywhere near those Arkansan swamps where the ivory-billed woodpecker( Elvis?) was purportedly rediscovered? That would be cool. I think I 've successfully identified 5 to 6 species of woodpecker, two in my backyard and the rest in the mountain forests. But not the IBW. <p> Nothing special in the works, probably just haunt this place per usual. The return has been generally quite good, though there are recurring issues that are often ugly( e.g., her foot-dragging on seeing someone to help her process the burning pit of anger she 's carrying) But today we worked hard together for 5 hours or so and it was good. Oh, and as to the IBW, no, we 're in the ozarks not the delta. BUT, swear to allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suet feeder! Check the dude out, he ' fucking enormous! <p> HOLY CRAP! Pileated is about the size of a crow. I know that if I saw a bozo-haired crow with warpaint looking in my window in the morning, I 'd( a) require a lot less coffee that day, and( b) either quit drinking, or start drinking, whichever was more appropriate. <p> I get the Ladderback and the Northern Flicker in my yard regularly. I have some berry-producing trees that they really dig. But my all-time fave backyard bird, my bestest buddy, is the Phainopepla( shown here in flight). There are several mating pairs in the neighboorhood, but the one from my yard and I have developed something of a relationship. He sits in the tree off my patio, staring at me, as we exchange whistles. Then he flies to the top of a utility pole, where he does leaping sommersaults while calling something that sounds like " pretty bird! pretty bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You should see the damage they can do... think big forearm sized holes in minutes! Your Phain sounds like quite the little showoff... I
