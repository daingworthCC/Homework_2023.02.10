I have created an extra field at sign up for a secondary email address and would like order updates to email this address as well as the customers primary address automatically. <p> Hope this makes sense. <p> Clients would like for example there manager and there accountant to receive order info changes automatically. <p> I am thinking this is a case of knowing where to edit the code to select the second email address from the extra from field as well as the primary and email to both of them. <p> Remember : Any code suggestions you see here are merely suggestions.

Example : Joe blogs orders 1 widget and confirms the order. Joe blogs email is joeblogs@email.com which is the email he used to set his account up. I need to be able to add a second email to his account so as the customer Joe Blogs has a primary email joeblogs@email.com and a secondary email joebloges2@email.com. Then when orders are confirmed both email get confirmations and order updates. <h> Re : How to have order status info and updates send to 2 email addresses automatically <p> Oh.

Very unusual for customers to want to get multiple duplicates of emails about their orders. <p> You 'll need to write your own custom code to send emails to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale is in **27;8268;TOOLONG, and the admin side which sends status updates from your store administrator is in /admin/orders.php <p> Remember : Any code suggestions you see here are merely suggestions.
