5130641 <p> Aviva Drescher and Ramona Singer still get along on-screen on The Real Housewives of New York Season 5, but based on their tense Twitter exchanges, it 's clear that Aviva was n't exaggerating when she told us that she and Ramona are " not on good terms " in real life anymore. On Season 5, Episode 10 : " You Want To What Me In The Where? " Aviva brought up her ex-husband, Harry Dubin, while out to dinner with the cast. Ramona always thinks it 's odd when Aviva talks about her ex, and she turned to Twitter to diss Aviva 's " faux pas " while the episode aired. " Wow a faux pas by @AvivaDrescher does she still have a thing for him?!? " Ramona tweeted. Not one to take an insult -- Aviva is happily remarried, so implying she still has feelings for someone else is pretty insulting -- lying down, Aviva shot back, " As much as Mario still has a thing for my sister in law Ginjer. " For her followers, she clarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with my sis in law once? " <p> Obviously Aviva is n't saying that Mario is carrying a flame for his sister-in-law -- her point is that both she and Mario are over their past feelings. <p> Still, this is yet another fun, odd connection between the Housewives. Reality TV may have brought them together, but it 's clear these women really do run( and date) in the same circles. <p> The Real Housewives of New York
