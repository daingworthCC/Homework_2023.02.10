Eschewing the transaction-and-finance focussed approach of other players in the risk management space, and building on the lessons learned from SIM( Supplier Information Management) vendors, Resilinc has built a unique approach to identifying and quantifying the relative risks in your supply chain. <p> Started by a Risk Management practitioner in the high-tech and electronics supply chain, who has a Masters in Engineering in Logistics( from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Resilinc not only builds on the lessons learned from SIM, but on the lessons learned from real risk management practitioners and specifically focusses on the electronics and high-tech, medical device, and automotive supply chain - realizing that, when it comes to risk, not all supply chains are created equal. <p> So what is Resilinc? It 's an affordable DSS( Decision Support System) for larger mid-size and large multi-nationals that need to <p> identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep tabs on what facilities may be impacted by a significant external event, and <p> be immediately informed when an event could cause a disruption that requires immediate action. <p> The solution, delivered using the SaaS( Software-as-a-Service) model, does this by tracking all of the relevant information on each supplier and facility in your organization 's multi-tier supply chain. Whereas a typical SIM solution( that powers a typical financial risk analysis product) will track each supplier, their official information, their insurance certifications, their corporate addresses, etc., Resilinc 's solution tracks each individual manufacturing facility, the products produced at those facilities, the inputs required, the lead times required, and the time taken to get the plant up and running again as a result of a serious disruption( such as a natural disaster, border blockade, strike, etc.). Based on this information, integrated financial and location risk metrics imported from other systems( for which you have a license for), and the relative revenue impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then able to <p> provide an overall risk score, delivered in terms of the revenue impact of a disruption, for each location and product, <p> give you the ability to determine the impact of an external event in a given location with respect to supplier locations and sourced products, and <p> determine which locations and products are likely to be impacted by a significant event anywhere in the world, as soon as it happens( and e-mail you a notice that the event -- which may be an earthquake, war, or labour strike -- is potentially impacting one or more locations in your supply chain). <p> Risk Managers can use this to determine which locations and products have the biggest risks, which facilities will be impacted the most as a result of a supply disruption in an area, and which product( line) s are at risk as the result of an event that just happened. And then they can take action. <p> Resilinc is a powerful tool for the high-tech, medical device, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably too reliant on financial metrics, which are not the only risks
