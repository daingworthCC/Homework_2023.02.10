5123541 <h> Motorola 's DROID RAZR M is incredible, and it 's an iPhone 5 preview <h> You May Also Like <p> So... I like Android. I use just about every Android smartphone on and off, but my main phone is an iPhone 4S. One major complaint I have with Android is that the phones are just too big... seriously. First it was 4 inches, then 4.3 inches, then 4.5 inches, then 4.6 inches, then 4.7 inches, then 4.8 inches, then 5 inches, then 5.3 inches, then 5.5 inches -- ugh. <p> Motorola 's DROID RAZR M, which was announced on Wednesday during the company 's press conference, packs a 4.3-inch display into such a small frame that I truly think the company got it right. It 's so easy to use one-handed, it 's comfortable to hold and it makes me want to use the phone more instead of infuriating me. <p> Also, Motorola 's hardware game? This is probably the nicest hardware I 've ever seen out of Motorola. Incredible build quality and attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day, but I already think this is one of the top Android smartphones for the holidays -- by a magnificent mile. <p> One of my only complaints is that I wish the display looked better, it 's PenTile and it 's not the best quality, but if that 's the only thing I have to complain about on an Android phone, you know you 're doing something right. <p> Here 's where I go off on my iPhone tangent. <p> The DROID RAZR M is about the same height as what we can expect from the iPhone 5. It features a larger screen than the iPhone 4S, and it 's physically taller. I had reservations about an iPhone with a larger screen, but I can honestly say that this really works. Since the phone is n't wider, it 's not uncomfortable to hold and the added height is still easy to control with your thumb and one hand. <p> So, this phone has basically shown me that the new iPhone 5 is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body, and that I 'm going to like it. A lot. Even
