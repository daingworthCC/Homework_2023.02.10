5158841 <p> There was an article in Le Monde yesterday called Les Oprateurs Confronts la Saturation des Rseaux( Operators Confronted to Network Saturation) which summarised some of the key thinking( or is it posturing) that came out at Idate 's Digiworld conference last week. Nothing new there, the main thing is telco CEOs saying they are facing a revenue/cost squeeze on mobile broadband and that therefore the internet companies will need to / must pitch in. <p> I still ca n't wrap my head around that argument. The absurdity of it is staggering. These guys are selling mobile broadband access on the one hand, aggressively fighting on prices to acquire as many customers as possible. They are effectively creating the mobile broadband access market. And at the same time they 're complaining that they need to upgrade their backhaul network to deliver on that very same product? Surely the solution to that is evident : the price is too low, or it 's too flat. Easily fixed. <p> Is there any other industry where people sell services, have to invest to deliver them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I do n't like analogies much, but that would be like highways asking car manufacturers for subsidies because the price of the highway tolls was too low. Just increase the bloody price! <p> I must say that I 'm finding I have less and less patience for this constant posturing. Telcos should decide once and for all which business they want to be in and do it sensibly. How can these mobile operators state that they 're not in the access business yet flood the market with access products and then complain that they 're not cost effective? <p> The other absurdity here is that it seems the telcos believe that Google is making pots of money on each of their individual customers. I do n't know if Google releases average " per user " revenues, but my suspiscion is that in relation to the say 35 EUR per month that telcos make on a mobile subscriber Google 's revenue per user per month is probably around 1 EUR. Were they to share that, it would n't make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own making. Google 's money comes from having hundreds of millions of customers, not from making a lot of money on each of them. <p> I keep going back and forth on this question of whether telcos as we know them can embrace change or will they have to go through near-death experiences or beyond to do so. This kind of declaration unfortunately leads me to believe that they will not be able to change significantly enough to avoid crashing. <p> See also Murdoch 's brilliant plan to get Microsoft Online Services to pay him for the right to index the blurbs on Newscorp news stories. Killer detail : MSFT Online Services division is a lossmaker. There 's a sustainable business model for you -- find someone who does n't have one and demand money! I think a lot of other businesses have a very odd view of Google. Murdoch 's yelling and whining about Google News, for example -- he seems to imagine that Google News scrapes the whole of his news stories and therefore scarfs his ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excerpt of a news story there? You go straight to his Web site. He also seems to imagine that Google News is a major line item in Google 's P &L,; which... is n't realistic, and that his Web ops make up a large percentage of the Web, which is n't realistic either. <p> http : //none.com steve <p> A rough calculation for the UK shows a profit per internet suer of about 30p per month, just under 1 per month of revenue <p> ftth68 <p> A concise description of a pan European mobile paradox. To the point, again. <p> ISP Marketier <p> So, if per user revenues are so low, do you think it 's healthy for the industry to keep those " more bandwidth consuming than revenue generating services " alive by law( e.g. netneutrality)? Already by today, 80% of internet-users are paying fees for the p*rn-consumption of a few. If there was a fair interconnection business model on the Internet, those guys would have to pay their own share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry. <p> http : **31;2199;TOOLONG Benot FELTEN <p> ISP Marketier, There are two assumptions in your post which I think I disagree with. The first is that there is a linear cost structure to bandwidth. Nandwidth is n't a finite resource, just because a user consumes bandwidth does n't mean it automatically generates a related cost for the service provider. Note that I 'm not saying there is no cost either, I 'm just saying that there is n't a mechanical variable cost associated with bandwidth. The second is that flat rate is a result of regulation. It is n't. Network Providers are free to introduce other pricing plans, which would change us from all that complaining My own view is that they have n't used the tools at their disposal, and the key tool here is pricing. In fact, that is where we 'll really see the competitive markets emerge : in competitive markets, we will see a diversity of pricing strategies, in non-competitive markets they will all price the same. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic, that service providers have yet to rediscover the pricing tool. I disagree with you, on the point of their power to do so. It is the willingness of consumers to understand their usage behavior which has to be adressed. I agree, that it is the service providers task to do so. But " netneutrality by law " will not help. Content-providers which have to attach a price tag for bandwidth to their service would help to adress this problem. I also disagree on your cost assumptions. Depending on the business model of the service provider, there is a mechanical variable cost associated with bandwidth : Wholesale. If the service provider happens to buy bitstream from a network provider, in most cases I know, the service provider has to pay for bandwidth. Which is good, as this model gives incentives to invest $$$ into more bandwidth, if needed. But even the network providers have to admit cost increases. Just like in any other CAPEX-heavy industry, a reasonable business man will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of a tyre factory, selling tyres for the cost of the raw gum plus employee wages, ignoring the investment it did in production machines?( Please do n't fall for the " falling router-prices " point -- you can not reduces costs, by switching from high-price routers to low-price
