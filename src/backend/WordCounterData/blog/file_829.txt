5191741 <p> Today the Pogo Player Spotlight is delighted, excited and positively ignited to present two remarkable Pogo players Midge195125 and JeepGirlJade. <p> Midge195125 impressed us with her remarkable crocheting of Pogo Characters! We got a hold of Midge 's daughter, Jade, and together they answered some questions for us. <p> Chrystal <p> Jade <p> Where do you live? On Vancouver Island, in Campbell River, BC Canada. <p> What are your astrological signs? <p> Chrystal( Midge) : Capricorn <p> Jade : Aries <p> Your favorite games? <p> Chrystal : Monopoly &; Mahjong Safari <p> Jade : That changes daily for me. I would say I love them All!!! <p> Chrystal, when did you first decide you wanted to crochet these characters? You ca n't help but get into the characters when you meet them in the games, they are like your own personal cheering section! I wanted to have them with me in person, so I started planning them in my head shortly after I started playing on Pogo. &; take that &; stir in some OCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you, Midge195125, tell JeepGirlJade that you wanted to make these, and what was her reaction? My daughter, Jade, wanted them as much as I did! Of course, we had differing opinions on which ones should be done first, so we decided in a civilized manner -- we fought about it! It is easier for her to chose as she wants them all right now! <p> Which was the easiest to crochet? The Bee <p> Which was the most difficult? I would have to say Spike. He has more sections, more curves, and it takes more math to figure the design out, But seeing as he is my favorite, he 's worth the effort! <p> Which is your favorite? <p> Chrystal( Midge) : Spike <p> Jade : Tiki Guys <p> Have you had anyone who knows nothing about Pogo comment on them? If so, what did they say? <p> Chrystal : We have introduced quite a few people to Pogo through the characters. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end table. People walk in, pick them up and start playing with them without even thinking about it. Then they will ask about them, where the idea comes from and we 're off on another Pogo exploring adventure! <p> Are there any other Pogo characters you 're going to crochet? <p> Chrystal( Midge) : Yes Definitely! The war is on on whether it will be Meep or the Chameleon from Gin.( &; if you guys can help us out with some pictures of the Dragons from Mahjong Gardens, the dragons will be bouncing around soon after!) We really Love these guys! <p> Have you ever dreamed of Pogo characters? <p> Chrystal : Not as of yet, but I have played a few cartoons out in my head! <p> Okay... now let 's hear more about you! What are your favorite foods? <p> Chrystal : Donuts! <p> Jade : Pizza <p> Favorite drinks? <p> Midge : Coke <p> Jade : Pepsi <p> What 's the last good book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rereading Dragon Rider 's of Pern by Anne McCaffrey <p> Jade : anything at the moment by Harlan Coben or Dean Koontz <p> And the last good movie? <p> Chrystal : do n't have a particular favorite at the moment <p> Jade : Avatar <p> And, of course, what is your favorite Pogo game? <p> Chrystal : today it is MONOPOLY : The World Edition but that changes without notice. <p> Jade : I think today it is CLUE : Secrets &; Spies, but I love them all! <p> Thanks so much for joining us and sharing with us your craft! Do you have any final words you 'd like to share with the community? <p> Chrystal : I started creating crochet patterns so others would be able to make the things I make. I 've heard to many " I can'ts ". I believe we all can if we throw out the word ca n't.

I hope the powers that be at Pogo offer you something for your creativity. How much do these wonderful patterns cost?
