5175141 <h> Making the most of the open enrollment opportunity with targeted marketing <p> Last week, I received a pamphlet from a major health insurance company. The pamphlet was advising me that the Medicare open enrollment period was upon us, and to enroll before the deadline passed. <p> What was the problem with this particular piece of direct marketing collateral? Well, first, I 'm not a Medicare subscriber( too young). But that 's probably because it was n't addressed to me, but rather the previous owner of my home. While the flyer provided useful information, there were clearly missed opportunities to take the communication to the next level. <p> Most payers are giving special attention to the senior market and looking for innovative ways to promote Medicare Advantage programs, as an increasing proportion of the U.S. population turns age 65 and becomes eligible for Medicare. This is an attractive opportunity for payers to collect high-margin business. <p> Challenges facing payer seeking to capture a share of the market include the fact that the plans that payers are offering Medicare Advantage subscribers fall within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate the plans are few, and payers need to differentiate themselves through the quality of care, and their customer acquisition and retention activities. <p> A key to competing in this growing and profitable market is effective communication for acquisition and retention. Every communication is an opportunity to build loyalty, and doing so requires a personalized and targeted approach. <p> For the message to get through, payers need to ensure that they 're communicating with potential customers via the medium they want to be communicated with. Gone are the days when Medicare subscribers could only be reached by impersonal radio and television ads, or mass mailings. Today 's retiree is digesting information from these channels, but is also receiving email, text messages and researching their major purchasing decisions online. <p> Once the correct method of communication is established, data quality becomes an important consideration. This can include physical addresses, email addresses and other important contact information. Much like the pamphlet intended for the previous resident of my home, incorrect data will cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money. Today 's communication often pulls data from multiple, disparate sources which creates opportunity to segment and personalize messaging. But disparate sources often result in inconsistencies that require extra steps in order to reconcile differences and ensure that the information is correct. <p> It is easy to focus on just the outbound direction of communication, but today 's technology enables smart payers to listen, as well as promote. Once the payer is confident that the communication will reach the intended recipient, they should seek to use new channels to create a dialogue. The flyer I received included a phone number, but no website( or better yet, a personalized url) that would enable a prospect to respond. This inbound communication enables the payer to verify contact information, including preferences, and validate interest. <p> Today 's communication technologies incorporate sophisticated analytics capabilities to measure engagement and automate the most appropriate messaging based on gathered intelligence about recipients. By getting a better understanding of the recipient and learning as much about them as possible, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send. This means that they can advertise the plan that best fits the recipient 's lifestyle and health status. <p> Streamlining the development and delivery of personalized communication is easier, and more critical, than ever before. Advanced master data management( MDM) and customer communications management( CCM) solutions enable payers to create targeted messages that reach prospects via the channels they prefer with the help of automation. <p> MDM and CCM solutions can aggregate all information about prospective customers from multiple, disparate sources, including social networks. These communication data hubs dynamically build a comprehensive picture of the prospect as the dialog takes place considering behavior such as anonymous web searches, as well as responses to campaigns. From there, and " interaction profile " of prospective customers can be built and combined with more traditional attributes such as demographics and claims history. <p> Finally, these solutions can track and manage all communication that goes from the payer to the prospect, to create an acceptable cadence. In addition to collecting feedback and building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company does n't inundate the prospect in a way that would cause them to tune out. <p> Medicare Advantage is a huge and growing market. But in order to capitalize on the opportunity, payers must differentiate themselves through targeted, effective customer acquisition and retention communications. By embracing MDM and CCM solutions, payers can be poised to make the most of open enrollment season, and grow
