5205241 <h> Book Giveaway Today! <p> Guest Blogger : Ken Gire <p> I did n't write my first book until I was 30, perilously late for someone with no training. I had taken only one creative writing course in college( at age 20) and dropped it halfway through the semester, mainly because each class consisted of students reading their work aloud, with other students commenting on it. <p> That was it. <p> We were encouraged to express ourselves, but we were never taught how. <p> I think if I had been given some guidance back then, it could have saved me ten years. I did n't do any creative writing again until I was 30. It was a book for young adults, titled Treasure in an Oatmeal Box. When I finished the book, it was like finding a missing piece to the puzzle of who I was. And I set my course on the precariously uncertain future of being a writer. <p> Except I still had no training. <p> I applied to the master 's program for professional writing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew no writers, no editors, no publishers. It was a lonely experience. And a discouraging one. <p> It would have been less lonely and less discouraging if I had had a mentor. <p> In the absence of a mentor, I learned by observing everything and trying to adapt what I learned to the craft of writing. I watched movies, trying to learn from the various artists who had collaborated on them. I listened to music, studied the structures of buildings, noted how interior designers could move you from room to room with such smooth and subtle transitions. I read the best writers, studying their style. I observed nature, studying its style, too. <p> As a result of 30 years of living like that, when I teach weekend retreats on writing, I teach writers how to learn the way I learned. I teach them how to look, how to listen, and how to embark on a lifetime of learning. <p> Over the years I have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit, mainly because I knew from my own experience how much a little help at the right moment can mean. What should you look for in a mentor? <p> Truth. Without honesty about your craft you will literally never move your writing to the next level. <p> Encouragement. While nearly every writer needs to improve in specific ways, gifted and growing writers have areas they 're already doing well in. <p> Tools and Resources. A coach/mentor does n't do the practicing and learning for you. You still have to put in the work. But a good mentor will point you in the right direction. <p> Hope and Reality. You need to know if you 've " got it. " A good mentor will either bathe you with hope of the goal yet fulfilled( publishing well), or he will splash you with the reality that you 'll always have a day job. <p> Because I believe so whole-heartedly in the advantages of having a mentor, I 'm starting a Mentoring Program for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their readers. Whether fiction or non-fiction, through books or through films, the principles you will learn are equally adaptable to all areas of communication. <h> What are some of the ways you nurture your writing when you 're NOT at the keyboard? <h> Have you ever had a writing mentor? If you had one, what would you hope to get out of the experience? <p> * * * <p> Ken Gire is a multi-award winning bestselling author. His most recent book is Shaped by the Cross( IVP). For more information about his Mentoring Program, email him at kengire AT gmail DOT com. <h> Book Giveaway <p> Leave a comment by Saturday night at 11:59 PM EST. We 'll randomly select two commenters to receive a free copy of Shaped by the Cross. <p> I nurture my writing daily by spending quite a bit of time daydreaming. When I 'm in the car or trying to go to sleep at night, I 'm running my stories through my head and looking for ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never had a writing mentor. I guess the best thing that I could get out of it is accountability. Might help my procrastination problem to have some to challenge me. <p> There are ew writers who have kept journals of the process they went through in writing their books. But one does come to mind -- John Steinbeck wrote a journal, titled " Working Days, " when he was writing " Grapes of Wrath. " I read it after I read his novel, and it was really interesting to see the day-to-day things he did as he wrote. <p> I 've always read and always admired writers and like a lot always thought how great to write a novel. A few years ago I joined a blog with writers and saw some great examples of writing. I 'm not 65 and the first I ever attempted to even begin to write something by doing the NaNoWriMo this year. Very scary, but I was amazed at how the words flowed when I got started. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will nurture. I 'm currently editing the novel and when initially writing, the characters lived in my head even when not at the computer writing and I found music helped to set some scenes that I was trying to figure out. Enjoyed reading your post and about your experience. Thanks. <p> The part about using music to figure out scenes intrigued me. Would you like to share some of the music with us? And would you share more about the process? I think everyone would love hearing about it. <p> I am where I am today because of some amazing mentors along the way. They have inspired me, given me encouragement, honest evaluations, teaching, examples, and opportunities to grow and excel at my craft. I shall be ever grateful for each of these writers for their generous gifts of their time and talents, and I would love the chance to pass it on to another. <p> When I am not in the actual depths of hacking away at my keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text I nuture my creative spirit through my lifelong creative process of delving into myth, ritual, romantic poetry and the awe inspiring rythms of nature. These things, along with the relfections and suprises that I get from my dreams are the food that my creative soul feeds apon to only then spew it out back onto a page and hope that someone will enjoy it. <p> My only writting mentor was my supervisor for honors in Studies in Religion, the wonderful Carol Cusack. I will never forget the day that she turned to me and with honesty and ensouragement handed me back a paper reviewing Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code and said " Michelle, you need to work harder ". From that day she became my harsh yet ever faithfull and encouraging mentor. My mistress Whipcracker <p> You are doing wonderful things to nurture your creative spirit. Your phrase " rhythms of nature " caught my eye -- and my heart -- because I have been nourished by those rhythms most of my life. <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rilke and my reflections on it from a journal I published years ago, titled, " Reflections on Your Life " -- <p> Just as an artist 's body of work would bear certain stylistic similarities whether she worked with oil paints or water colors, so the way God works in the natural world bears similarities to the way He works in the spiritual world. The German poet, Rilke, was a student of both worlds. In a letter to a young poet, he explained that the natural process of becoming an artist was " to ripen like the tree which does not force its sap and stands confident in the storms of Spring without fear lest no Summer might come after. " To ripen, either as an artist or as a human being or as a Christian, takes time. And the greater the thing that is being grown, the more time is necessary for its ripening. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, are all fruit of the Spirit. And they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't take time to produce is artificial fruit, which has neither the taste of real fruit, nor its nutritional value, nor the seeds to reproduce itself. <p> This is a great post! I had the amazing opportunity to study with an award winning author who did all of those things. It helped my writing tremendously. I do n't know if I would 've broken into the publishing market without her. <p> A few words of encouragement along with careful constructive criticism can really change an aspiring author 's whole outlook. <p> A writing mentor would be great, but an editing mentor would be the greatest. Mentors are fabulous because you can ask them all the little real-life questions that the books do n't answer.( " Is it appropriate to use a question mark before a colon? " Who knows!) <p> The verbal equivalent to someone answering the question -- " Who 's there? " -- and saying, " It is I. " <p> It 's correct ; it just sounds funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Using things in your prose that look odd or sound odd -- even though they are correct -- have a tendency to take the reader out of your story. If you do that, you have not served your reader well or your story. <p> I love reading Pat Conroy, for instance, but there are several places in " Prince of Tides " where the vocabulary is so much in the stratosphere that it takes me out of the story and leaves me scratching my head. Or worse, it makes me put his book down and get a dictionary. <p> If there is too much of that, the reader will either get irritated or else feel stupid. <p> But I digress... <p> Google -- Can you use a question mark before a colon? -- and you will find your answer. <p> I guess I would consider a past college professor of mine a mentor. She seemed to really believe in me even though she was somewhat cold and standoffish. She told me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention me when you win your Pulitzer. " Ha ha ha! It might never come true, but that 's true motivation. <p> I 've had a couple of writing mentors. I was lucky enough to get into writing really young, and there have been two writers that I 've met at conferences who have changed my life. They share a few common traits : <p> 1. Wisdom born of experience and intelligence. 2. Practical kindness and honesty. 3. A true, deep caring about people. <p> I love my mentors -- it 's a complete delight to be cared about by them. They 've both got a fan and a friend for life. <p> I feel sad for the people who 've commented that they never had a mentor. Seriously -- not fair. So, should I ever become wise enough to be a mentor, I 'm going to try to help other writers along the road that I was helped along. <p> Forgive me for not answering the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went in search of a mentor. I attended a writers conference he spoke at over a decade ago. During that time, he said, " Everyone wants a mentor. But everyone is busy. " True, true. Because of those two truths, I enrolled in the Christian Writers Guild, which pairs writers with mentors.( Kathy Tyers was mine -- so, so excellent for some of the very reasons Ken listed.) Now, years later, I 've been blessed with other mentors who have poured into me the truth, encouragement, resources and hope that Ken lists as attributes of a mentor. So, yes, I 'm not answering the question per se. But I 'm nodding my head as I read Ken 's words -- and I 'm thankful I listened to him all those years ago. It made a difference in my writing life. <p> I 'm glad you got to come to one of my writing seminars. I loved watching people like yourself grow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art form as it seems. And that they all have it within them to become an artist. <p> I have always loved writing- even report cards. I write for children but always as a Christian with a mind to educate and entertain children at the same time. Last year( 2010 nov) I had An Unexpected Friendship Amherstburg 1846 published and, in that book, I championed the underdog- freed slave and Irish immigrant to Canada- based on some true facts.( see http : //www.truestorybooks.com) My mentors were my grammar school teachers in England, friends who like reading and a husband who writes well and loves to read. I am fortunate. I also love the language of the Bible. <p> I started out by writing children 's books, Jane. I do n't know if you have read anything by Katherine Paterson, but I think you would love her book on writing for children. It is titled " Through Gates of Excellence. " <p> If I watch a movie or T.V. show that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters, the story line. What about that can I bring to my own book? <p> I am lucky enough to have a mentor. I think the most important trait in a mentor is someone who wants to see you grow. They 're not afraid to tell you what is n't working as well as what is working. It 's important to have a balance. <p> If we 're lucky, we have more than one mentor. I have a writing mentor and a parenting mentor. <p> I like watching tv for that same pupose. I have two favs that I watch specifically. One to see how the characters change to the plots that are happening to them and the other to watch my beloved Doctor change the circumstances. I read on another blog that most writer 's already come with certain areas their good at and have to learn the other areas in writing. She has never been more right. <p> i watched ' Smash ' last night and loved it. i was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be another ' Glee'and i already had that. i loved storylines that converge so that show filled my bubble. it also reminds me of the movie, ' New York, I Love You '. although they were meant to be shorts, putting them together kept the sudience, me, engaged. Vantage Point ' is another good movie that shows vifferent POV 's for a single event. it even inspired a story that got pushed to the side. <p> I wholeheartedly agree with the concept of mentoring -- in writing, in marriage, in parenting, in our Christian walk. A mentor is an invaluable gift. So many aspects of life can be enriched by a mentor. <p> However, as I read your post, I was struck by the unique gift the writing world would have lost out on if you, Ken Gire, had been blessed with a mentor. Your lack of mentor shaped who you are today, as much as having a mentor would have shaped you differently. Finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing on today. The guidance you would have received from a mentor may have altered those insights or even obscured them altogether, making them unavailable to shape your writing. The wisdom you are passing onto future writers through your workshops would not exist, or at the very least would not exist in the same capacity. <p> Indeed, the mentoring program you have such a passion for may never have come into existence. If a mentor had been provided for you, perhaps you would not have had the deep appreciation for mentoring that you hold today. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. <p> The absence of a mentor may have, in the end, reaped far more benefits than having a mentor could have. Of course, we 'll never know. Not this side of eternity. <p> So, while I applaud the mentoring program you are establishing and recognize the immense value it holds, I also see a life of blessing that has risen out of adversity( of not having a mentor) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get only an infinitesimally small glimpse of it. So many times what we see as challenges and frustrations are God 's training field for endeavors we could never imagine, for purposes and plans to further His kingdom that are simply too big for our minds to comprehend. <p> The more I write the more I realize the need for a Mentor. My life is dedicated to Jesus Christ and I want to write for Him. My knowledge is varied, in music, as a church organist for 60 years, three education certificates, and many experiences. These are all waiting to be put in publishing form. My mother is 104. I am getting as much of her life history as I can first hand, and have journals, family trees, bible histories, journals from her brothers and sisters, and a geneology traced back to the 1300? s. Where do I start? <p> As a way of encouragement, Eyrline, you are doing all the right things in terms of collecting material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time comes. And you will find the place to start, as well as the place to end. <p> I think it is helpful to have the ending first. Knowing where to start will come from that, in my opinion. <p> Maybe not overnight, but over time. <p> It is a noble thing you are wanting to do, Eyrline. Blessings for the journey ahead of you. <p> I do n't have a living mentor. I think C.S. Lewis is my mentor.( But, no, I do n't channel him!) <p> And, for my current novel, my protagonist is my mentor. And, yes, I guess I do channel him, in the way that writers do. <p> Painting( pictures, not walls &; ceilings!) is a wonderful way of nourishing writing. I want to find a painting teacher, since I 'll never find time and inspiration to paint otherwise. I guess then the painting teacher would be my mentor. <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art, as expressed on his home page. But I live in Luxor, Egypt! My Arabic teacher might be able to connect me with someone on the faculty of the local art school. Inch'Allah. <p> I do n't have a writing mentor, just friends who are writers or publishers who toss me advice. A mentor would be awesome, though, and I 'd welcome it. <p> Nurturing my writing comes in a variety of forms. I am with people most of the time and listen to their stories. Reading helps as well, because it refills the well from which I draw. Another form of replenishment is a the odd object game, in which you learn to pick one peculiar item from any room( waiting rooms are great for this) and create a mental scenario for how it got to the room, who made it, etc. Finally, I sometimes write continued stories with others to see where their mind goes. It 's a fun way to see new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P J Casselman Two rapid knocks echoed through the dark woodwork of my study. I quickly dropped my pen and rose from my leather chair. The house should be empty, I thought. " Who 's there? " I called out. There was no response. A small ripple of apprehension swept over me as I stepped to the door. Grabbing the knob, I slowly turned it and then suddenly swung it open. <p>( Your turn. Please add to the story where the next person leaves off.) <p> -- the story was continued by several people who took it to crazy places, but it was a fun ride. <p> Its funny because.when I read, I look for plot points then character. If plot sucks and the character stinks, its a done deal for me. When I write though, I focus on character. I love having my characters pegged, me being a people watcher and all. So to hone my craft, I do what I like doing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the better the books, even if the plot is a little left lucy. <p> You are so right. A writer needs someone professional who can give them encouragement and inspiration and truth. I 've been writing for quite a while and have become friends with a couple people who have become my mentors. They 're very observant yet still help me keep my voice. <p> I have had many mentors these past three years. The first was a counsellor who suggested I write about my experiences to help me come to terms with them. I used the real emotions to write fictional stories and she encouraged me to take up writing, ' as a hobby, or occupational therapy, or a second career- see how far you can take it '. <p> My second mentor is a writing coach, who taught me writing is a craft that can be studied and practised until it is mastered. He has become a valued friend who I return to every time I achieve a new level of experience. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new task and off I go again, smiling. <p> I gain invaluable mentoring from my writing friends -a small group of talented writers who accepted me as one of their study group and are slowly bringing me up to their standards. <p> Some days I mentor myself, stepping outside of ' me ' and telling ' her ' what she needs to hear to motivate or educate ' herself '. Sometimes I need to give ' her ' permission to relax or celebrate. <p> To have an official teacher and guide is lucky indeed for any writer, but many mentors come in unique disguises and should not be overlooked. <p> I like that you 've acknowledged the alchemy of mentor pairings. In my own experience, mentors do n't typically announce themselves beforehand- they tend to show up in the least expected places, in unanticipated forms. As it 's so often said, " When the pupil is ready, the teacher will come. " <p> I forgot to mention- you do n't have to be ultra-experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with talent and enthusiasm under my wing. I teach them all I can( within my limited capacity) and direct them to better sources for further learning. They maintain the friendship and return to seek further teaching, or guidance on the next stage, or even to share their publishing successes. Though I would not claim the title, I know they consider me their mentor! I 'm honoured and humbled and I can not describe my joy at seeing them develop. Soon they will both surpass me and need a more experienced guide, but it 's a privilege to have shared their experiences and if you get the chance to do the same, grab it! <p> Ken, thanks for sharing these insights. I do a lot of pre-writing and creative brainstorming in my head. I find that my best ideas happen when I am away from my laptop. As for mentors I 've had some journalism professors and editors I would consider as mentors, as well as members of my writers group. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 and about to publish my first novel. Best wishes to you. <p> I nurture my writing by constantly mulling over things. I write down random thoughts and keep the notes in a file for future mulling to keep myself on track with my current project. <p> I am extremely fortunate to have a mentor. I met Prudy Taylor Board at one of her book signing events. I was buying her book " 101 Tips on Writing and Selling Your First Novel " and she invited me to her critique group. She is totally honest with me and keeps apologize for being " hard on me " lol. It 's what I value the most -- good, solid, honest critiquing that helps me continue to improve. <p> Like you, I took creative writing classes -- but mine were in high school. I did n't decide to actually write until I was 50. It was like coming home to a place I 'd always wanted to be. <p> " It would have been less lonely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am 57 years old and the closest thing I have ever had to a mentor for writing, was when Susan Meissner extravagantly spent her breakfast time with me after staying up late to read my sample pages. <p> In the absence of a mentor, I have followed much the same course of learning as you, Ken. For me, the emphasis is on music and reading the best authors. Long walks keep me sane, inspired and centered on the God of the Universe. <p> I nurture my writing by constantly mulling over things. I write down random thoughts and keep the notes in a file for future mulling to keep myself on track with my current project. <p> I am extremely fortunate to have a mentor. I met Prudy Taylor Board at one of her book signing events. I was buying her book " 101 Tips on Writing and Selling Your First Novel " and she invited me to her critique group. She has since become my mentor and friend. She 's totally honest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lol. It 's what I value the most -- good, solid, honest critiquing that helps me continue to improve. <p> Like you, I took creative writing classes -- but mine were in high school. I did n't decide to actually write until I was 50. It was like coming home to a place I 'd always wanted to be. <p> When I 'm not at the keyboard, I nuture my writing by reading and using my own behaviours as an experiment. I read books on improving my writing and then I go back to some of my work, and the new information helps me discern why I need to delete a paragraph, or add voice/imagery to a sentence. I look at the books i 've purchased, and based on the knowledge gained from the ' how to ' books, I can explain/justify why I picked that book off the shelf as opposed to another, as I 'm now wiser about the importance of having my title/flap cover hook my reader(s). <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one, I 'd want them to be someone who started where I have ; huge heart, little contacts. Nothing inspires a protege like having a mentor who faced similar struggles because it confirms that there is hope, and affirms that they too can achieve greatness. I 'd want the writing mentor to let me make some mistakes, because there are some lessons only the pain of disappointment will teach, and I 'd also like my mentor to show me those valuable insider lessons gained, from the business of trying. <p> Mentor... I have had mentors and I have mentored other writers. I am still doing these two things. I still have those who mentor me. I still give back by mentoring beginning writers. I have also had wonderful editors who taught me so much as they edited my books. <p> I only began writing at 56. Guess that puts me way behind. Sigh. As for mentors, I am divided on that. The right mentor could be beneficial but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor General 's Award, Canada 's most prestigious award, told me. When he took a course at university from a well known writer that prof told him to find another line of work, that he would never be a writer. How wrong he was. Support and guidance can come from many directions. Just take it with wisdom and hold on to your own voice. The expert might be wrong. <p> I would love a mentor as I started my memoir at the perilous age of fifty-eight -- I do keep a blog of Bible studies started in 2004 and started a new blog in keeping with my book. I have friends who read and comment, have taken one writing class, but have n't found the right mentor. One consideration is I 'd want one who encourages, but is n't afraid to give hard criticism in a constructive way. My pastor mentored me through the healing portion of my life and helps me spiritually. I suspect we can have mentors for different aspects of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a mentor, per se, but I have joined a writing group. Just last night one of them spent half an hour on Skype with me helping me design a website. They have edited my work, sent articles on how to improve writing, and directed me to websites with valuable information. The only thing I could want more is a sounding board, since I like to talk out the story before I write it. <p> I would n't say I have one mentor so much as entire chapter of them. I joined the local chapter of the RWA and have learned so much since. Every single one of the published authors has been willing to talk to me and give me encouragement or advice. They pushed me to go for PRO, which I did, and gave me a realistic view of what I could expect from a writing career. Every time I see them, I learn more -- and not just from the topics we cover in the meetings, but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the ones who told me about conferences, helped me network with critique groups, suggested I look up sites that have improved my writing skills. I 'm every day grateful to be part of such an extraordinary group. <p> I would love to have a mentor, but I have been writing for 15 years and attending conferences and have never been lucky enough to find one. I 've been in several writers groups with people around the same place I 'm at, and we encourage each other, but a mentor would be a great help. <p> The best thing about mentors is honesty. I 've had several mentors, and I do n't want to be torn apart -- so what I want from them is a balance of what I 've done well and what I have n't. If it does n't work, I need to be told -- not coddled. <p> From my mentors, I 've learned most when they 've told me, " It is n't working. " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Mentors and people who are honest and willing to offer of themselves are so important. In the fast pace of my world, it is wonderful to have someone take time to share their experience and knowledge with no strings attached. <p> My start in writing came because of a mentor. A college drop out I did n't have the " training " but I met up with a lifelong newsie with ink in his veins. I spent a grueling year writing for Gene 's " hobby paper " a community pub he founded because retirement " bored him. " Each successive column was dissected, winnowed and restructured until Gene was happy. Fourteen years later I feed, clothe and house my family putting to work the same principles I learned from Gene. <p> Education is fine... but mentors and life experience make all the difference. <p> Somewhere in this industry that makes much money off of the ambitions of fledgling writers there should be someone who could tell us we are better suited for a satisfying hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest assessment and a goal-shaping mentor could be one of the best gifts any writer could receive, at any level of skill or training. The best, that is, right behind a contract. <p> When I 'm not at my keyboard? When is that? Jk. I try to read a lot and pay attention to what I 'm reading. It 's always been important to me to keep studying something about the world, even though I 'm not in school. Something like geography or poetry or karate. <p> I do n't have a mentor exactly, but have found a wonderful writing group in my community that has helped me immensely. Thing is, we are all pretty much in the same boat with everyone in about the same skill level. I have connected with other writers online or at writers conferences I 've attended who have more experience that I feel they 've taught me so much. So I suppose in a sense I have mentors. <p> To nurture my writing, I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write. I also love listening to podcasts( my favorite is writingexcuses.com by Dan Wells, Brandon Sanderson, Mary Kowal, and Howard Taylor) or presentations given through writing conferences that have been posted to youtube. <p> I am 37 years old, and I have just started seriously pursuing my writing career. I have read over fifty books on all aspects of the craft, studied writers who 's styles I liked, taken a freelance and a creative writing course, and written my first novel. I have never had a mentor, although I am on the list for one at the Horror Writer 's Association as I am a member. I had to use the training wheels of " mimic " to get where I am today. It was hard, damn hard and I am still learning and always will be. I think a mentor would have greatly helped speed up my education and confidence. Thanks to people like you, maybe someone else will have an easier time and a better shot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group, but when your supporters are unpubbed, it is kind of like the blind leading the blind, so to speak. How should a new writer approach someone they view as a mentor? And for those who are considered mentor material, how do you choose someone to mentor? <p> Of course, we have an advocate in Jesus Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith. Thanks for a great post! <p> I 've longed for a mentor for app. 20 yrs. I hate going it alone -- I really do. But mentors seem like fairies, people who are not quite real. Do these people actually exist in a world that is busy and unfriendly and filled with overwhelmed people who are having difficulties just living their own lives? <p> The challenge in finding a mentor, for me, has been a reluctance to ask. Anyone who is further along the writing path than I, whose writing I respect, and with whom I have a relationship is already so busy that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mentor me. So, I echo Kelli 's question : how does one find a mentor? <p> That being said, I have taken a few classes from a writer who, as an extension of our classwork, has offered to read my outline, first chapter, even my query. She has provided valuable feedback. She is such a lovely, generous woman she would probably do more, but I hesitate to ask for more demands on her time. <p> As for nurturing my writing when I 'm not at the keyboard? I am an actress and a singer. While being in a play has its drawbacks in that it is a big demand on my time( time demands again -- notice a theme?) the process of developing a character for the stage directly translates to how I develop the characters in my novels. And singing... I sing jazz and there 's nothing like the lyrics of the old standards to get you in touch with emotion. <p> Starting to write at 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned articles and letters to the Editor( which almost always got published), but I am still waiting for my agent to find a publisher for my first book. I 'll be 60 on my next birthday! <p> Another author I came across published his first book at age 82! <p> I understand what you mean! If you want to become professional, you got ta get an early start. <p> What 's encouraging about your learning format is that the classroom is not the only method of delivering learning. I have already got two Master 's degrees and I just ca n't picture myself going back for another Master 's degree! <p> Mentorship sounds like a great approach. We all need coaches and mentors in our lives. Even as a Life Coach myself, I also have my own life coach. <p> I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is **40;6392;TOOLONG... <p> The BELL RINGS and the other children file out the door for recess. <p> The boy 's shoulders heaving. <p> The boy now SOBBING. <p> The boy continues to write : <p> I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. I will never say that 30 is perilously late to start writing. <p> I have no mentor, know no other writers, and am actively seeking a writing group and possibly a mentor. I have no formal education on writing aside from two English Comp courses in college. I wrote my first comic book at age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notebook paper at 8 or 9. In my late teens and early 20? s, I began alot of stories, but never finished any of them. At 28, I began another and decided to finish it out. Ten months later, I had an 85,000 word manuscript that 's no good with no clear idea how to go about revising/rewriting it, but there it sits, a story and characters I brought into existence. In that ten month span, I wrote two short stories, one entered into a contest and did n't win anything, the other being held under consideration, though it probably wo n't be published, either. In the mean time, I 've written three more short stories and am about 2/3 through another novel. The first is collecting dust on my desk, as it is not ready for submission, but some objective feedback would be welcome. Without a mentor, I believe the already long road of hard work and rejection will be even longer. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of myself that I was missing, no matter how long and hard the road may prove to be. In that way, I nurture the dream because the dream is there. One thing I 've found to be both a blessing and a curse is that no one cares. Nobody cares if I publish or not. If I have something worth saying, worth reading, it 's all on me to prove it. On the other hand, NOBODY CARES! I 'm free to write what I want to write. And so I do. Will it ever reach readers? I ca n't say, there are too many variables. What I know is that there is a fire in me to tell stories through the written word and to tell them well. And as long as it burns, I will keep trying. <p> In my Word Weavers critique chapter, I 've found multiple " mentors " in those who have more experience and different strengths. I have found an equal blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> I believe we can all mentor in small ways by sharing what we 've learned about the craft, by being honest, and by being an encouragement to one another. <p> Having said that, I 've already sent for more information on Ken 's mentoring program. I 'm ready for a season of discipline and growth! <p> 30 is a perilously late start? Yikes! I 'm in a major hurt. I'v been writing non-fiction in various jobs for over 30 years, but did n't embark on my actual writing career until age 58... and without a degree. I took a creative writing class in high school, but when I headed to college, I tested out of all the lower level writing courses and my first and only college writing class was Advanced Expository Writing -- which I aced. <p> But, back to the blog questions. <p> How do I nurture my writing when I 'm not at the keyboard? In a way, all the day jobs I 've had throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work I did in those positions was n't necessarily the kind of writing I really wanted to do, it was practic. I got good at writing, editing and proofreding. <p> Currently, I maintain a writing schedule outside my regular job and write for an hour nearly every day. I also keep a notebook handy at all times and jot down random thoughts so they wo n't be lost. I get together monthly with a group of other writers to share work and encourage each other. Once a year I treat myself to a writers ' conference. I read books on writing and I read just about every book I can get my hands on, not just for the enjoyment, but also to learn from others ' best efforts and from others ' worst writing mistakes. I enter at least one writing contest each year so I will be forced to meet a deadline and go through the **40;6434;TOOLONG... process. Every day I network( at least briefly) with other writers to exchange ideas and encouragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for the publishing insight, one that offers writing tips as well as suspport for local writers, and a third that reviews books and provides the latest information on publishing and booksellers. <p> I have two writing mentors who have a published book and two others on the road to publication. I interact with them daily on some level. I also have a friend who is a small local publisher who has given my writing some exposure. <p> Like Ken Gire, when I started writing in earnest, I rediscovered the part of me that had been missing for decades. When I 'm writing, reading about writing, talking about writing, or thinking about writing, I am incredibly happy. If I never make a penny as a writer, I know this is something I will not give up again unless I become too disabled to do it... or die. Writing IS my life. <p> I love the disciplines that have grown out of your passion for writing. They reminded me of the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected in " Letters to a Young Poet. " <p> Here is the quote : <p> Go inside yourself. Explore the reason that compels you to write ; test whether it stretches its roots into the deepest part of your heart, admit to yourself whether you would have to die if the opportunity to write were withheld from you. Above all else, ask yourself at your most silent hour of night : must I write? Dig inside yourself for a deep answer. And if the answer is yes, if it is possible for you to respond to this serious question with a strong and simple I must, then build your life on the basis of this necessity ; your life, even at its most indifferent and attenuated, must become a sign and a witness for this compulsion. <p> I received a mentor through the Christian Writers Guild Apprenticeship program. I loved this program and the mentor I had, published novelist, Karen O'connor, was a blessing for me! She was honest but fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still keep a firm hand in mine when I was at my wits end about the craft. I recommend Christian Writers Guild programs very highly. And Ken, I was 40 when I started the program! Yikes! <p> Way over the age of 30, I started to pursue a career as a writer. I was 49. Still capable of cognitive thought and able to learn and work hard, I plunged in. My copy of " Self-Editing for Fiction Writers " by Renni Browne and Dave King is dog-eared. More than three years into the process now, I 'm currently marketing one of my novels and have completed three. For years, I had been writing the bible study material for my church, which it publishes ; but I also began to write inspirational material -- my first article will be published by David C. Cook in September -- -and I began to blog. <p> Obtaining a mentor was a great blessing as I ventured into the mysterious world of the publishing industry. It came about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired editor -- Janice Burton( yes, retired from David C. Cook). On my behalf, my relative asked her if she 'd read my novel. Jan later told me that she thought, " Oh, great. A novel. If it 's lousy this could be long and tedious! " When I emailed her, she responded accordingly, asking me to give her at least six weeks, probably more. <p> But late on the night that she received my MS, she emailed me and said, " I ca n't put your story down! It 's a page-turner! I 'm calling you on Monday. " <p> I had acquired a mentor. <p> " You are a novelist, " she told me when she called. " How did you learn to do this? I 'll do everything I can to help you. " <p> That affirmation worked a miracle! To be told that you can write fiction when you 're first starting out at almost 50 is an incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated me to keep up the hard work. Jan reads every book I write. Her encouragement has kept me going as I 've slogged through the querying process. She ushered me into publishing houses. I 've received encouraging words from editors. However, my first two novels were biblical fiction. Jan and I discovered that this genre is difficult to get into print if you 're unknown. She exhorted me to keep going. I changed genres and wrote an historical romance. An agency has my historical manuscript right now. <p> Having Jan for a cheerleader kept me going when things were dark and I was tempted to give up. She gave me tips and helped me to trust my voice. No matter what, I always knew she was in my corner. An older writer brings a wealth of experience to the table, Jan reminded me. Without her help, I could n't have kept going. The entire experience of meeting her and having her come alongside me was necessary for me to press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely has been a blessing! I 'm attempting to offer that type of encouragement to young writers. I do some one-on-one time with teens who write, and I try to encourage the creative college students I know who are writing( graphic novels and fiction). I love talking to teen and young adult participants at writers conferences, just to hear their stories and urge them to go for it. Sometimes, we all need a kind, uplifting word to keep pursuing our dreams. <p> I 've never had a writing mentor, but I have had mentors at work, and they 're invaluable. <p> I 'm still new to the business of writing and having someone to guide me through the murky paths of the writing craft and the marketing and social media requirements would save so much time and frustration. If I had a mentor, I 'd want what you mentioned : tell me whether I have the talent and ability to succeed, where I need to improve, and what 's the best use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are, it would be refreshing to have someone honestly tell me whether I should keep my day job. <p> I have three primary things I do to nurture my writing when I 'm not at the keyboard : 1. Be observant. I 've trained myself to notice and absorb the details and nuances of everything around me -- smells, sounds, colors, textures, body language, facial expressions, and so on. For unique items, I 'll take notes or pictures to remind myself. 2. Collect pictures and articles. I read newspapers and magazines and clip out pictures, articles, or other items that relate to my writing or that spark my imagination for future stories. I file these clippings and refer to them when I need an idea, inspiration, or a concrete example. 3. Read. I read the works of writers I admire or those whose books are in my genres. I also get many ideas from reading my Bible! <p> Regarding your wanting input on whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best writers of the last generation( Two Pulitzer Prizes for his " Rabbit " series, Harvard graduate, started writing for the " New Yorker, " etc.) said that he did n't believe any writer should do it full time. Probably not the advice any of us writers want to hear, but after doing it full time for twenty years, I think -- for a multitude of reasons -- that he is right. <p> I have a mentor within my small writing community, and I have learned a lot from her, especially about the business of writing. I would love to have more of a critiquing mentor to help my writing improve, and I 'm trusting God to provide someone when He sees fit.( I just wish He 'd hurry!) When I 'm not at the keyboard, reading books on how to improve my writing has helped me a lot. I 've also taken some great classes. Honestly, I think just letting my mind wander and seeing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity for me. <p> Although I have had mentors, as a teacher, as a reader and even as a woman, I have had very bad luck working with a mentor as a writer. The first one got angry when I let him know that our politics were at opposite ends of the spectrum. I was afraid he would find out on FB or some other way, and thought it best I told him. He wondered why I would tell him ; he thought I was trying to get him upset. The next mentor was a published author of historical fiction, which is what I thought my ms was. I did get some nuggets of understanding so I ca n't say it was a waste, but the woman tried to tell me things about who I was, as a writer, and she was quite off-base, AND she would n't let it go! When I told her, no, I have seen myself as a right brained person in every area of my life, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things off was when she told me I needed to bring in the conflict earlier and when I did, she told me I brought it in too soon. At that point, I realized that I was the best judge, esp. at this point, of how I should write and what I should put where. Oh, also, despite it being my 4th draft, she insisted that I not go back and edit. She said that everything else I had written was " just notes " and that I was working now on my 1st draft. When I found out she pulled all her books off the shelves because there were some historical mistakes, I realized that this was not the kind of person I wanted to take advice from. <p> " Treasure in an Oatmeal Box " is one of the most pivotal books of my childhood. I have no idea how many times I read it. I bawled every time, but it definitely helped to shape my love for all people. Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first book I wrote. I became so attached to the main character that I could n't write the chapter where he died. I had to write the last chapter first, then slowly, reluctantly, I went back to the chapter of his death, crying the whole way through it. <p> I liked this post a lot! I find myself in a very similar situation as the one described, it 's really encouraging to know that you can still get a chance of success starting relatively late and without formal training. <p> I have four pieces of advice I give to writers during my seminars. Here are the first three : <p> 1. No one can keep you from writing( you have almost sovereign control of that. Cut out a nightly sitcom, and you suddenly have 10 hours a month) <p> 2. No one can keep you from being a good writer( you have almost sovereign control over that, too. Writing is a craft that can be learned.) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did n't quit( like a skier who shushes down the black diamond runs ; that same skier started where everyone does -- on the bunny slopes, feeling awkward and cold and frustrated). <p> Finding a good mentor would be fantastic! I have been writing online for 11 years, I write for a newspaper and now am doing the final technical edits on my first ms. I have been ruthless critiquing my own work, but what 's the use in doing that if no one else will do the same? I love the quote " do n't sacrifice the permanent on the alter of the immediate ", it makes me want to push as hard as I can to do the best work that I can. I write what I like, and hope my( future) readers will like it too. But to have a wise sage look at my work? That would be every shade of awesome! <p> If you have been given a gift, a responsibility comes with it. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can. Others can give you tools, but you must learn how to use them, how to maintain them, keep them sharp. Otherwise, like any tools, they will grow rusty and dull. <p> Thank you for the advice, Mr. Gire. I agree that learning is a lifelong process ; no matter how old we get, there is always something to learn, something to improve. I see learning as one of the joys of life. As Solomon states in Proverbs 20:15, " There is gold, and a multitude of rubies : but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. " <p> I nurture my writing by reading... especially memoir since that 's what I 'm writing. But all kinds of writing teaches. I have been on a two year journey of learning through others ; having conversations with fellow writers and willing listeners to my ideas, going to writers conferences, following blogs, cruising through bookstores, writing my blog. Right now I actually have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving to be for my message development. I am sure having a writing mentor would be a tremendous help in keeping me on track, keeping me writing, and developing my writing. Hard to keep up the momentum on my own sometimes! <p> Dear Mister Gire, sir, I 'm trying to be refined, mature and all professionalishlike, but now I 'm *every shade of stoked*! Thankyou!!! <p> And in other news, I have a part-time job as an op/ed writer for our city newspaper. I have a strict limit of 450 words per piece, no mercy whatsoever, my editors are brutal! Therefore, that limitation has honed my skills to be concise, literate, informative and articulate without wasting precious words on fluff. I consider my editors to be mentors, because they have taught me to keep it brief, but feed the reader with solid knowledge without overloading on needless extras. Kinda like what I 'm not doing here... Perhaps learning to give oneself a strict word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information as possible is a great way to practice the old art of " showing, not telling ". <p> I 've been studying the book of Acts, the time period in history when Christians turned the world upside down. Like Noah 's animals, God sent these early disciples out two by two. Peter and John, Paul and Silas, Paul and Barnabas, Barnabas and John Mark. Paul and Timothy. No one worked alone. <p> My favorite was Barnabas, " the son of encouragement. " By coming alongside the newly converted Paul, he mentored him, enabling and equipping him to become a dynamic preacher, compassionate teacher, and the writer of two-thirds of the New Testament. Imagine if those of us newly called to writing could have such a powerful mentor/encourager. Perhaps our writing could also change the world forever... <p> What are some of the ways you nurture your writing when you 're NOT at the keyboard? <p> I study my favorite movies and TV shows to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier to dissect a movie compared to an episode on TV.) I read writing craft books and blog posts about writing from other writers. <p> Have you ever had a writing mentor? If you had one, what would you hope to get out of the experience? <p> I have never had a writing mentor. This is the first year in which I have decided to take my writing seriously( at the age of 30). If I had a mentor, I would want to be able to increase my knowledge on story structure and character development, discover ways to motivate myself when I do n't feel like writing, to have someone who has had experience with the publishing world and knows what to go for and what to watch out for. Just being able to talk to a mentor about being afraid of writing and have that person understand would mean a lot to me. <p> One of the things you can do, since you love movies, is to watch the movie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story. Then watch it again, trying to analyze it as an art form. Finally, listen to the director 's commentary to see hear how the various artists contributed to the film. <p> I have not had a writing mentor, but I am intrigued by the idea. I nurture my writing when not at the keyboard by writing in various journals -- as of late, I do writing exercises with my children. Ten minutes on a topic, no stopping. Then we read what we have written to each other. <p> Thank you Ken and Rachel for a most fortuitous post! Just last night all I could think of was that God put this burning desire to write in me but I ca n't do it alone. I really needed someone to help me along my path. <p> I 've always loved words and writing stories but never had any guidance whatsoever. Once I graduated high school I thought that was it and that I should forget about that part of me and just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before I literally had to start writing again for my sanity. Add another 10 years to teach myself how to write fiction. It 's a pretty lonely journey but I am making slow progress. <p> How do I nurture my muse? Read. Read read read. I read what I like and the genre that I want to write in, not what others think I should read because " it 's great literature. " Hundreds of years ago, apprentices copied their master to learn how to be a better artist so that 's what I 'm doing. One step at a time. <p> Thanks to you because after long time i recalled my mentor who was good at me and guided a lot but today i got a chance to speak about him. His name is Ramachandran who tells me chemistry in my B.Tech Days. <p> Instead of a " writing " mentor, I would benefit from a " publishing " mentor. I 'd like to know someone who has been published in a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional and indie publishing. How to pitch my book to agents, publishers, and my audience. <p> The magazine, " Writers ' Digest, " has a book club with a great selection of books on what you are looking for. The have books on how to write a query letter, how to write a proposal, how to pitch your story, how to approach an agent, etc. <p> Just go to any Barnes and Noble, and they 'll have the most current issue. <p> oh how true this is ken! and thanks to rachelle 's encouragement a while back i have someone helping me with edits. oh but what a looooooong journey! are writers crazy? being that i never set out to be on this path, i find it a very odd terrain. yet somehow I stay on? which at times makes me think, " well yes indeed, I have gone mad! " i think i understand now that phrase writers say, " it 's in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your words ken. how generous you are( uh, and a little crazy) to open this opportunity up to us. Blessings to you and the gifts God has for you as you venture into this with those God has for you. <p> When I 'm not at the keyboard, and not reading, I nurture my writing by watching classics on television and analyzing their plots. As for the mentor, never had one, but it would definitely have kept me from stumbling and biting literary dust the many times I did. <p> Even more important for the aspiring writer than a mentor is solid knowledge of writing technique. It can be learned but only after sound teachers have been found ; they can be found but only after much searching. The corruption of humanities pedagogy in the U.S. has left many of those desiring to write with the false impression that either one has " it " -- meaning some inborn ability to write -- or one does not. This is a completely incorrect view, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920s with the Progressive Movement and culminating in the general cultural and educational anarchy of the 1960s. <p> In my own opinion, the modern view that " either you have it or you do n't " was one foisted on unsuspecting students by teachers who could not teach the craft of writing because they had never learned it themselves ; reinforced by a cultural milieu and educational philosophy which denied that reason had anything to do with creative activity. According to this view, technical knowledge only has applicability in the quantitative sciences, while creativity in the arts is ruled only by emotion. To find contrary views regarding the teaching of craft and technique in writing, you will have to dig quite far back, most likely to the 19th century, when it was simply taken for granted that writing was a craft grounded in techniques that could be taught. The student merely had to be willing to learn. <p> Books by these old writing teachers( some of whom lived into the first two or three decades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your local public library or used book shop. You can find them, as well as learn from them, if you take the time and spend the energy to do so. <p> In response to your email question on how I use music to set scenes when writing. I find that when listening to classical music it is usually the backdrop of most motion pictures and as you listen you can develop your own scene in your mind. More upbeat scenes, I definitely listen to rock and roll and sometimes even hard rock. Listening to classical sometimes helps picture a dramatic either murder/mystery or can even be a love scene as well as rock and roll. I even use music to get in a house cleaning mode. Always have, but as I age, I do n't dance around quite as much. Just my take on it smiles <p> The next time I read a weblog, I hope that it does nt disappoint me as significantly as this one.
