5178641 <p> On Saturday, the #6 Buckeyes remained perfect after their OT win over the Wisconsin Badgers. They have now won the Leaders Division but it does n't mean a lot since there 's no bowling season for this team. <p> For Wisconsin, they lost their opportunity to appear in the Big Ten conference game. At 7-4, 4-3, the team sits at No. 3 in the Leaders Division, but they can still play for a trip to Pasadena since Ohio State and Penn State are ineligible for the postseason. <p> The MVP of the night was Ohio State running back Carlos Hyde with his 2-yard overtime, winning touchdown run. <p> The Buckeyes will end their season against Michigan next Saturday. <p> Michigan Rolls Over Iowa 42-17 <p> Sorry Iowa, it 's cold in Iowa City in December and you 'll need to endure it this year since you 're not going bowling. <p> For the Hawkeyes, Saturday 's loss was its fifth consecutive one and a first since 2000. Change has not been good for this team. <p> Michigan 's Denard Robinson returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I say it was about time see him in this position. He played well on his 13 carries for 98 yards. <p> Starting Wolverines quarterback Devin Gardner was versatile : he had six touchdowns with three from running and three from passing. He had 314 yards in the air and one pick. <p> For Michigan, its road to the Big Ten Championship Game will be tough. They need to beat Ohio State( this has n't been done since 2000) and Iowa needs to defeat Nebraska next week. <p> I think we all know how this will end. <p> Northwestern Stops Michigan State 23-20 <p> The pesky Wildcats pulled off another fourth quarter miracle thanks to a 27-yard field goal. <p> It was the first win for Northwestern against Michigan State since 2007. For the Spartans, they will now need a win against Minnesota on Saturday to see a postseason game. <p> It was an interesting game in the second half as Northwestern took a 13-5 lead in the third quarter thanks to a pick six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see-saw kind of game. Thanks to a Northwestern field goal at the 7:30 mark, the team took its final lead of the game and kept it for the win. <h> College Schedule <p> FootballSchedule.me is not affiliated with or endorsed by the NFL, NCAA, any team, venue or box office.
