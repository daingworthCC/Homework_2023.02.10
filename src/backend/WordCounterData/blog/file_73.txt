5115341 <p> " Really, seriously, you 're not asking me about Hostess Twinkies are you? " Christie said. " You think you 're getting me behind this microphone having me talk about Twinkies? This is a setup, man, I know it! You people are the worst -- this is a setup! I am not answering questions on Twinkies! No, no, no, no -- it 's bad that I even said the word Twinkie from behind this microphone! <p> I 'm not trying to be mean, but I know there are some serious problems with discipline in a person as large as Christie. I think he loves power, it 's intoxicating to him, and if he has a large Muslim pop. in NJ he 's going to pander to it. I think in his quest for power and to ' be a great governor '( nothing wrong with that) he forgot LOYALTY and since he IS his world, it probably would never occur to him that he hurt Romney by cowtowing to that poor example in the WH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and NY shores are getting some help. I know they will come out of this experience a lot better as people as harsh as that sounds( those who have made it) but we need to keep PRAYING!! ALSO We must PRAY for ISRAEL and the situation there. Horrible, ignorant minions of Satan again. GOD is the only answer, folks. And regardless of what the poor, uninformed trolls on this blog say, or how much they say, they simply can not prove that GOD does not exist!! Draw closer to Him this weekend and next week and see if by one week from now you do n't agree. GOD BLESS US ALL. <p> and for CHRISTIE : TRY : PROVERBS 28:7( for those who do n't know... everything about LIFE is covered in the Bible!) HAPPY THANKSGIVING -- REMEMBER BENGHAZI! Pathetic that we have a president who held back on defending our own men because he did n't want that Terrorist Taint to harm his election. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christie can hide his thoughts but not his girth. We were all into his " no nonsense approach " in the beginning, but that slobbering toward obama was more than I could stomach. <p> I did read( tri-ox &; momrules) about BNI( barenakedislam) post and it 's an eye opener about Christi and what his true beliefs are. yikes! That Jill in Fla. is called a dhimmi christian in a post too. If we love this Country, we should let each other know how important it is to look this stuff up so we can be more aware of what 's happening to our Country( faster than we 'd ever know, I 'm afraid.) Does anyone remember Tokyo Rose? <p> Speaking of Twinkies.... I was at the Wonderbread outlet to pick up some bread and the parking lot was full of folks 1/2 hour before opening time to get their last load of Twinkies and various Hostess goodies... I got news for Ya 'll.... Some competitor will surely by the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and you 'll be getting them from the competitor... <p> Actually all complacent Americans happy with their bread and circuses are to blame. Historically, to combat your enemy, you divide the country. This has happened. You control the media. This also has happened. You attack religion and morals. Done. You create confusion. Definitely done. You continue to spread propaganda in the four stages strategy. This is a quote from a Professor who examined the propaganda from WW II and Cold War. " The first level is the Big Lie, adapted by Hitler and Stalin. For example, the state-controlled Egyptian press has been spreading a Big Lie, saying the World Trade Center was attacked by Israel to embarrass Arabs, " <p> " The second layer says, ' It does n't have to be the truth, so long as it 's plausible. ' <p> " The third strategy is to tell the truth but withhold the other side 's point of view. <p> " The fourth and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad, the losses and the gains. <p> Contact your congress every time you see an injustice. Make them listen. Most importantly, educate yourself. <p> REPAIRSEA : You have all the talking points most do n't even bother with. We ca n't idolize people in D.C. anymore than we should idolize those idiots in Hollywood. There are so few people I really have faith in anymore. We have to support the good and decent people who 're doing their best to keep America on track, to follow our Constitution and Bill of Rights. So many 49%+ only want all their free stuff and do n't care about anyone else or anything. The rest of us have become so complacent or discouraged? I hope not. We ca n't let the ENEMY get a larger foot-hold on this Nation. We are the World 's watchdog, there to help whomever needs it and have taken our eyes off our own Country. Time to wake up and think about what this Country was founded on, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You 've got it all figured out, right Christie? Just kiss Obama 's ring, help him get re-elected and you 've won over the hearts of the Democrats, which will surely help your chances of getting re-elected Gov., or maybe in your run for president? Have you forgotten how well it worked out for Spector? <p> He thinks by supporting Obama, then in 2016( if Obama decides not to run again or if the one world government has n't started.... because if that happens then we know Obama will be campaigning for that position.... after all he is the " Chosen One ") Christie hopes that some democrats will see how he accepted Obama with open arms and will decide to vote for him in the 2016 Presidential race. <p> Actually he does have it figured right. Develop man-love for the leader of the dem party so it is easier to make the transition to that party. You could see that coming shortly after his election and closing of the the coal-fired plants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that what we use for reasonable commentary &; discussion on this website? Your not the only one reducing political discussion to it 's basest name calling kindergarten level and I 'm hopeful that you do n't represent the majority. <p> As for the story itself, I agree it 's not much of a story although he was probably right that he was being setup. <p> Oldpharto........ you are a spineless little person with no moral compass. The Tea Party stands for personal responsibility, limited government and lower taxes. If a moron like you ca n't see that you are being raped by your government that says a lot. Spineless little sheeple wants the nanny state to take care of you cradle to grave. In the future that will be about minus six months. JAGOV <p> Im sure you are over joyed that people are going to lose their jobs, because Stalin Obama is in office. The only one laughing is America 's enemies because they are watching this country fall apart without having to fire one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brain already. Pick up a history book and see what entitlement programs do. They make things worse, not better. You do n't care as long as you get your free handouts from the government, right? Well pretty soon you will have to stand in soup lines. How is that for free handouts? Thats socialism, enjoy!!! <p> Old... you are ignorant... MANY Tea-Party aligned groups and people have ALWAYS warned that Christie was a Progressive in Tea clothing and that one day he would cave and return to his roots. The slight by Romney in not picking him as VP and the chance provided by Sandy to get NJ LOTS of money finally pushed Christie back onto the Progressive Plantation... Sure he causes them grief at times and does n't tow the union line... but many Dem mayors and governors are doing the same thing because they see the peril to their city or state. But do n't worry, the back door deals have built in fail safes for the unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies down and the people go back to sleep. Why do you think that only in WI where you have a TRUE Conservative as governor that you has protests but not in NY or CA or many other hardcore liberal states and cities that had to make " emergency measures " to cut spending? CA was ready to literally storm the mansion and hang Arnie when he tried to cut spending to balance the budget in 2008. When he lost at the polls, they still called for his head and fought him everyday until he left in 2010. But when Gov. Moonbeam Jerry Brown does the same thing... do you head ONE noise from the NEA, CTA, or state employee unions... NO... why... because they know they get it all back PLUS more once the people go back to sleep... <p> The middle east is on fire, tens of thousands are losing their jobs, the economy is on its way to hell on a greased poll and we 're worried about a juvenile delinquent reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it.... It is no one 's fault that they believed Ovomit 's lies but their own, now they reap what they have sown... and every single time I hear a business has laid off, or closed it 's doors.... I let them KNOW " Ovomit BUILT THAT " -- and YOU put him back in office! <p> This guy is a complete joke. He 's a narcissist ASS parading around in an elephant costume. He 's from the NE!! Look at his policies... the only reason he has R behind his name is because it was his only way of challenging Corzine. He 's a complete joke... it 's so sad that conservatives think he 's something he 's not! <p> The truly crazy thing in my opinion, New Jersey will dump him at the end of his term and go for the next clown with a " D " next to his name but, will be a hundred times worse on everything you just described. You know, somebody like Corzine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caving in to the unions, vetoing bills to help small businesses, I 'm done defending him. In two years if there 's a real Republican running against him, I 'll vote against Christie. <p> I have lost all respect for Chris Christy. It was a question regarding a company going under because of the policies of Obama and the influence of gangster union bosses that are affiliated with Christy 's BFF
