5175741 <h> Is Mitt Romney a charter member of the 47 percent? <p> In politics, there 's nothing more fun than watching a politician self-destruct. Mitt Romney 's doing a better job of it than most. <p> Let me count the ways. First, his disastrous trip to Europe, where he managed to insult the population of every country he visited. He came home only to name extreme right-winger Paul Ryan as his running mate, thereby automatically assuming the questionable mantle of the candidate who would eliminate Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. <p> Romney and Ryan then presided over the dullest political convention ever, remembered only for Clint Eastwood 's empty chair act, which Romney capped with his ham-handed comments on Libya, accusing President Obama of siding with the murderers of Ambassador Chris Stevens. <p> And now Romney 's made his biggest gaffe to date, denouncing 47 percent of Americans as good-for-nothing moochers who pay no federal income tax, take no responsibility for their own lives, and instead just loll around, waiting for the next government handout. They all support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even going to waste his time asking for their vote. <p> Romney made his snooty comments behind closed doors at a $50,000 per napkin reception in Boca Raton on May 17. But when they surfaced this week, on a video filmed at the event and released by Mother Jones, Romney did n't back down. He doubled-down, insisting that his view of takers vs. makers sums up the difference between him and Barack Obama. <p> Now we knew Mitt Romney was out of touch with average Americans. Unless you own a NASCAR team, or an NFL team, or three or four dressage horses, you do n't exist in his universe. As Current TV 's Jennifer Granholm told the Democratic Convention in Charlotte, " In Romney 's world, the cars get the elevator ; the workers get the shaft! " <p> So, we knew he was out of touch. We just did n't know how out of touch he was -- until he maligned half of the American electorate. Yes, according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans pay no federal income tax. But Romney has no idea who they are, or why they pay no taxes. They 're not freeloaders. They 're military families. They 're working poor and middle-class families. They 're senior citizens on fixed incomes. <p> Of course, they do pay some taxes : payroll tax, sales taxes, local taxes. The main reason they pay no federal income tax is one Romney will never understand : They do n't make enough money. According to the TPC, half of those paying no income tax earn less than $16,812 per year. Most have incomes less than $33,542 per year. Sixty percent of them have jobs. Twenty-five percent of them are elderly, living on Social Security. And most of them live in red states. Romney 's insulted his own base! <p> Apparently Romney also does n't understand that another reason those families owe no income tax is because they take advantage of certain tax credits for the poor, which the Republican Party has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was signed into law by Gerald Ford in March 1975. The child tax credit, adopted under Bill Clinton, was extended under George W. Bush. Under existing law, the Tax Policy Center notes, " a couple with two children earning less than $26,400 will pay no federal income tax because their $11,600 standard deduction and four exemptions of $3,700 each reduce their taxable income to zero. " <p> Yet, in Romney 's perverted world, it 's wrong for those poor families to accept any tax relief. They 're freeloaders! While it 's perfectly acceptable, even honorable, for Romney and his billionaire buddies to take advantage of every tax loophole on the books, including hiding their money offshore in the Cayman Islands or a Swiss bank account. He 's one of the biggest " takers " of all. <p> Romney does n't get it. The problem with so many people paying no income tax is not with those poor or middle-class families who do n't make enough money to qualify. It 's with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay more, and should pay more, but who pay less than their fair share or, perhaps, no income tax at all. <p> The big question : Is Mitt Romney himself part of the 47 percent he disdains? Is he one of those lazy bums who pays no federal income tax at all? I suspect he is. Only he can prove he 's not, by releasing his tax returns. <h> 6 Responses to Is Mitt Romney a charter member of the 47 percent? <p> Looks like you screwed the pooch again Bill,( you seem to enjoy that!) <p> Romney gives a greater percentage of his income as taxes and charity that either Obama or Biden( and most likely you yourself Bill). Seems over the last 20 years he has averaged a 20% rate. It seems Harry Reid made it all up. Of course laws are such that a senator can say anything they want on the floor of the senate without worry about prosecution. Are you going to scold Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what is creepier? someone owing several Cadillacs or someone flying his barber in from Chicago every other week for a hair cut????? <p> Mitt Romney claimed LESS in charitable contributions on his taxes than he actually paid thereby paying more taxes than he was legally required. Bill, you are so off base with you article, I really think an apology and a retraction is in order here. That 's what people of principle do when they 've made a total fool out of themselves as you have here. <p> How about the lie that is Obama? The below is taken from a ten part report, ' The Obama you do n't know ' : <p> Claim : Michelle Obama said they " were both raised by families who did n't have much in the way of money or material possessions. "... the Indonesian neighborhood, Menteng, where Obama 's mother and step-father raised the young Barry Soetoro was the most exclusive in Jakarta.... Later sent to live with his grandparents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama attended the exclusive private Punahoe school. <p> Claim : In his first job as a Chicago community organizer, Obama rejected more lucrative offers.... But while he worked in the city 's impoverished Southside, he lived in exclusive Hyde Park. <p> Claim : Of his 12 years as a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, Time Magazine said in 2008 : " Within a few years he had become a rock star professor with hordes of devoted students. "... But student evaluations obtained by the Examiner tell a different story. In 2003, only a third of students recommended his courses. It went steadily down in the last five or six years that he was there. He was among the lowest-ranked professors.... Nor did the future president leave any record of scholarly writings, while similarly credentialed colleagues had a prolific presence in law journals. <p> Claim : In " Dreams From My Father, " he wrote : " In my legal practice, I work mostly with churches and community groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health clinics in the inner city, and housing for the poor. "... But a document filed with the Illinois Secretary of State shows the young lawyer represented some well-heeled clients. In one case, he represented a politically connected preacher and real estate developer, Bishop Arthur Brazier, who had failed to provide heating and running water to 15 apartments in the dead of winter. Obama 's client had all the tenants forcibly removed from the building, yet paid only a $50 fine under Obama 's legal counsel. <p> For all of his critics on the right, community organizer Obama left many colleagues on the left disheartened, by allegedly selling out to the Chicago establishment.... The late radical journalist Robert Fitch, who specialized in urban politics, said : " What we see is that the Chicago core of the Obama Coalition is made of blacks who 've moved up by moving poor blacks out. "... D'Anna Carter, a neighborhood activist, singled out the president 's closest aid, Valerie Jarrett, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income real estate firm that made millions of dollars in part by leveraging federal programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit with subprime lending to poor people. " They were never interested in poor people. They would sell poor people a bill of goods, " Carter said. <p> Some argue that President Obama won office on his strength as a reformer but he rejected overtures to reform the Chicago machine..... " He made it pretty clear he was n't interested in risk-taking or challenging the Chicago machine 's lock on a lot of mechanics of government in Cook County in Chicago, " said one frustrated former colleague, former state Sen. Steve Rauschenberger.... Mayor Richard J Daley -- the last of the big city bosses -- built that machine by rewarding allies with patronage positions. Today, Obama 's choice of aides suggests an unbreakable bond to that machine. Closest aide Valerie Jarrett, campaign adviser David Axelrod, and former chiefs of staff Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley all cut their political teeth in the Daley machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penned this advice to mayoral candidate Richard M. Daley, the son of the big city boss : " Reward your friends and punish your enemies. "... In a 2010 interview, Obama urged Latinos to say : " We 're gon na punish our enemies and reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us. "... 31 Obama campaign bundlers received clean-energy loans and grants totaling more than $16 billion.... The auto bailout favored the United Auto Workers -- over secured creditors -- and eight of the 10 states getting the
