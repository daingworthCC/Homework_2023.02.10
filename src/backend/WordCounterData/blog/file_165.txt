5124641 <p> Marco Rubio talks about the real drivers of our debt being our entitlement programs and how we absolutely must reform them and grow the economy at the same time. He says we simply ca n't fix our debt problems with tax increases. <p> Otherwise, he says, we of others and do not engage in personal attacks. Otherwise we will revoke your comment privileges. <p> " The only solution to the debt is economic growth " -Senator Marco Rubio <p> This statement is simple, to the point, and the absolute truth. Senator Rubio nails it here. <p> What the Left in this country does not realize -- is that we need more rich people, not less. It is becoming more and more apparent that our generation must do everything it can to help make the future generations more wealthy. Even at our own expense. <p> It may be sad, it may be tragic. But, our children and grandchildren will need this wealth that we help them create to pay off the bills... that we handed them. It is only fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garden path here. He said nothing about shrinking the size and power of government -- in fact he was very dismissive about it. <p> He may dismiss those government expenses like foreign aid and welfare but that is disingenuous. Foreign aid goes to UN subversion and to enemies of US interests and causes many other problems. Welfare keeps people out of the work force( more pies!), destroys families and encourages illegal immigration and occupation. <p> A federal government that sucks off 20% of our GDP is still crippling in the long run. This is not smaller government -- it is smarter big government. <p> RosiesSeeingRed <p> You 're right sDee, but for the very simplistic minds on the left, who think all of our problems will be solved by just getting the rich to pay " a little more, " what Rubio is saying can not be said enough. They need to hear this very simple answer to their very simple solution in a way their very simple minds can understand. <p> sDee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard down. I linked to the negative budget trajectory chart in another post -- it was the elephants who pointed it south -- the donkeys just stepped on the gas. <p> I do not trust them. " The two enemies of the people are criminals and government " -- Thomas Jefferson <p> RosiesSeeingRed <p> I totally agree with you, and we the people are the only ones who can start to change things by electing the right politicians and then holding their feet to the fire. But when 1/3 the population( probably more!) still think raising taxes on the rich is going to make our 16 trillion dollar deficit go away, we 've got a long way to go to turn We The Sheeple into We The People. <p> First things first : help them understand taxing the rich wo n't solve the problem. Once they understand that( hopefully by example over the next 4 years with a pro-business president), they will be more receptive to other changes, some of which might be quite painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done, but it ca n't be done all at once, especially when there are so many delusional people walking around thinking that getting a little more from the rich is going to make everything all better. Step by step. That 's how they slowly marched our country toward socialism, and we 're going to have to patiently march ourselves back, one step at a time. <p> mark1955 <p> " This was a great talk ". Unfortunately that is all Rubio is when it comes to Conservatism... Talk! The very week Obama granted Excecutive Order Amnesty unconstitutionally, Rubio was working on a Back Door ' Dream Act ' with his liberal dem buddy 's and refused to comment on the particulars of it. How much money would that have cost American tax payer 's granting citizenship and welfare to million 's of illegals? Yet here Rubio is talking out of the other side of his mouth. Rubio was a liberal Florida state senator and then a liberal state House speaker. Upon reaching the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to refuse to join the senate Tea Party caucus. He was the republican co-sponsor of the senates internet freedom destroying PIPA legislation( The counterpart to the House 's SOPA Bill). When the Bleep hit the fan last year, upon the public finding out that what was in PIPA, Rubio and almost the entire repub senate delegation, who were fully onboard with the dems on this, pretended like they had n't ever heard of PIPA and feigned outrage. Add that to Rubio 's lying about his parents being refugees and his over two million dollars of personal debt and you have to wonder, just how and the Heck did Rubio ever get the be known as a Conservative, let alone a " Tea Party " favorite? <p> opinionatedhermit <p> I do n't do purges all that often. And, right or wrong, I actually encourage Marco Rubio and others to say what is in his heart.( How else are any of us ever going to learn?) <p> But, you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't impressed with his prior statements on immigration policy. <p> Personally, like you, I also think many Republicans miss the point with trying to explain Illegal Immigration. <p> If you really want to throw a nightmare in the mix( aka : have some fun,) the next time you get into a debate over this topic, ask the person you are talking to, " Exactly, what is the moral and ethical imperative, of encouraging people to come to this country for freedom and economic success, when in the end, all you want to do.... is put their employer in jail. " <p> There is so much wrong with our immigration policy that we have devolved into forgetting that actually defending the border is the very first thing we should be doing. <p> Again, thanks for your thoughts. I try and glean everything I can from them. <p> But Medicare and SS were never created as entitlements and he should not be calling them that -- they were set up as trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general budget now only because Congress raided the trust funds! <p> And is n't interesting that he dismissed an actual entitlement( welfare) as nothing to worry about. <p> We said we were going to hold these big government Romney Republicans ' feet to the fire -- so we better start listening carefully to the double speak. <p> opinionatedhermit <p> Actually most of world history will show you that insane wars, corruption and outright theft from rulers are the most common form of bankrupting a nation. <p> But, your point is well taken. There are also many, and I mean many examples of those who have figured out they also can make out like bandits from a nations treasury, if they just promise enough bread and games. <p> Heck, there are many in this country who are still waiting for their 40 acres and a mule. I guess all those government promises have n't always worked out as intended. Because, not even that one has yet to be delivered..... <p> wodiej <p> Well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MikeBri527 <p> Rubio claims, " we have a series of very good and very important government programs that are structured in a way that are not sustainable ". So how good can they be if they 're not sustainable? Is n't any program that is not sustainable a bad program? <p> Government needs to remove itself from the " social safety net " business. Programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc. should be phased out over time by privatizing them. <p> opinionatedhermit <p> You can not privatize and ultimately create a system of self sustaining medical care when there is no demand. The poor by definition are not " latent " in the analysis. They simply can not enter the market without economic help. <p> If, Senator Rubio is saying what I believe he is saying, it is that there are many ways to skin the same cat. Or, to put in " economic terms " there are some business models that keep the bleeding to a doable level, and some that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will blead us dry. <p> MikeBri527 <p> Why do you say there 's no demand? There is demand now, correct? I do n't believe the demand will ever go away. There will always be a demand for medical care. The issue is how much does it cost and how to pay for it. Privatization is( in my opinion) the best way to achieve that. However, it does n't mean that charitable entities ca n't enter the health care market place. After all, charitable entities are part of the private sector and therefore( from my perspective) count in the privatization of medical care. <p> All the best to you. <p> opinionatedhermit <p> I understand what you are saying. And from a compassionate point of view it makes a lot of sense. And, it is tough to argue against it. <p> Let me just say, I use the term " Demand " here, in it 's strict economic sense.( Some may even call it " clinical " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is separate from the actual " ability " to " demand " it as it is used in Economics. <p> MikeBri527 <p> OK. Got it. Yeah, when you put the words " ability to " in front of demand now I understand where you 're coming from. The only reply I can make is to say that I still believe in the generosity of Americans to be charitable. <p> I think the best example of that that I can give is the story of the elderly woman who was the school bus monitor who was verbally abused by the middle school kids on her bus. After the incident, someone decided to try to raise a little money for her so she could go on a vacation. I think they were looking to raise something like $5,000. At last count, I think the total about of money raised for her was over $700,000 dollars! <p> I do n't think that 's an isolated incident. I believe in the American people. I believe, even though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Judeo-Christian society that will help their fellow man BY CHOICE and when asked to, not by the force of government. <p> I hope I 'm correct. If I am, there 's still a light at the end of the tunnel( a long tunnel yes, but hopefully just a tunnel that at some point comes to an end). Privatization is still the best way to tackle these problems. <p> All the best to you. <p> sDee <p> We have to star separating the concerns however. Phased if necessary but it must happen fast. <p> First we must completely remove the Federal government from any and all regulation of providers and payers. The states can do that just fine according to the wishes of their citizens. This can be done immediately without any ill effects.( Cost to US tax payers is negative i.e a net gain through significant administrative cost savings) <p> Second get the federal government complete out of the role of payer. The payer responsibility needs to be completely shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then chose to buy private insurance or join pools in the open market as a means to mitigate their risk if they so chose.( Cost to US tax payers is negative i.e a net gain through massive cost savings) <p> Third cover the true poor who do not have access to private charity providers, with vouchers, or credits for services -- not insurance. Cover the elderly as described by the Ryan phased proposal. <p> It 's funny. We really do have an economic model to follow that will get us out of this medical debacle we have placed ourselves in. <p> It is called the " Internet Model " <p> As Bill Clinton so famously said many years ago. The best we can do as America to help promote the promise of all that this technology can offer, is for Government to keep it 's hands off and let mankind search out, explore, and let it evolve in the best way possible. That is, use a method of technological growth -- unencumbered by government forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say, " The real definition of Net Neutrality " is for government to keep it 's damn hands off. But, I digress. <p> More to the point : Government can do many things to help. Getting their hands in every aspect of it, is n't one of them. " <p> Get the government out of our healthcare decisions. Let all Americans make their own choices. <p> jdbaird <p> A lot of people have probably said that about the internet, did you have to use Bill Clinton 's version of the quote to make your point? <p> The Marxists think they will use Government money since all of the American people 's wealth is just a benevolent Government letting us keep their money/property. After we have all been reduced to a dirt poor 3rd World Nation, the PPACA will take " care " of those the Government either ca n't or just does n't want to care for. <p> JeffWRidge <p> Straight talk from a straight shooter. <p> CO2isGood <p> The Democrats are already taxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a way to tax the air we are breathing in, and once they do we can start paying down the debt. Easy-peasy! <p> http : **28;31838;TOOLONG Libertyship46 <p> Rubio will be president one day. He 's smart and he can take complicated problems and explain them in a simple way. If he gets two terms as Senator under his belt, I think he 'll be able to run for president, and win. The young Republicans out there are very impressive, but the first order of business is to defeat Obama this year. <p> As Rubio speaks the truth about the mess Washington has made of our county, the ' leaders ' of the GOP wanted Charile Christ as the senator. It is sickening to know that until the GOP Elite are stopped there will be no change in America and we will continue the slide toward the destruction of our nation. <p> I am so afraid that Mittens is not the man to do the necessary cutting in Washington to stop the slide, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do, damned if you do n't..... <p> http : //twitter.com/RLaratt Rob Laratta <p> I consider myself well informed on most matters. Enough that I can intelligently debate on any position I have. I did however fail to realize that we took in record revenue during the Bush years. I would like to see this as counterpoints, especially in debates, be even in speeches to drive home we do nt have a revenue problem we have a spending and growth problem. <p> http : **44;31868;TOOLONG John D <p> Rubio 's comment is the stupidest thing I ever heard. Nobody is proposing to only increase taxes. Democrats want a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, a balanced approach. <p> Sorry to disagree with folks but Rubio has it wrong. Food stamps is a big part of our national debt problem. That is an ENTITLEMENT program. When people receive food stamps, they are likely not working and not paying taxes. They are also likely drawing off other programs like welfare, general assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, child care assistance, education assistance. We the taxpayers pay for ALL of those ENTITLEMENTS! <p> I also disagree with Rubio that Medicare and SS are entitlement programs. We the taxpayers and business owners had no choice in have monies taken from our earnings to fund those programs for current and future generations. I want my contributions back. Yes medical costs have gone up because technology and treatment is better, but the true driving costs are the d@mn lawyers that look for any opportunity to sue and make themselves richer. Another driving cost are the union employees in the health care field( make appts, nurses, etc.) Get the unions out of our health care and implement tort limits and attorneys fees and you will see health care costs decrease. One other thought, SSI is the new unemployment benefit for the long-term unemployed. Unnecessary health care costs are driven up by these individuals that wo n't get a job but choose to find another avenue of income ENTITLEMENT. There are legitimately ill and disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the freeloaders. <p> IwjwI <p> My husband paid in over $250K to SS, but only received a few years of that back before his death. What did the government do with the rest of that $250K? Probably went to " freeloaders. " <p> Orangeone <p> I 'm so sorry for your loss. And yes the rest went to freeloading illegals. <p> TJinNJ <p> Hey Mark Levin -- You still Love this guy? He 's a wolf in Conservative clothing... Wakeup big guy... Good Ole Marco threw Michele Bachmann under the bus over Islamist Huma Abedin and you said Diddlely about it and still to this day promote him. As does your bud Hannity and others. We the people
