5152641 <h> share this story <p> America 's oil addiction and oil dependence are not a thing of the past -- whatever the media may have yipped at each other 's heels to tell you this week. In fact, we are on the verge of committing the world to a future of ever more expensive oil and ever larger U.S. economic problems for paying for oil imports -- not to mention the devastating impact this oil dependence has on the climate, air and water, and the economies of Asia and Africa. <p> Behind this optimistic hype is the annual 2012 World Energy Outlook produced by the International Energy Agency( IEA). This year 's forecast, in reality, is very grim. It projects that global oil prices will rise, in real terms, from their present, economy-wrecking $100 level to either $125 or $145 depending on how much additional investment consuming nations make in efficiency. It does foresee a brief spurt of U.S. oil production from about 10 mbd to about 11 mbd in 2020, but it slumps down to about 9 by 2035. Saudi production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's oil must come from OPEC than it does today, once the modest and temporary U.S. bubble passes. <p> The rosy media gushing about " energy independence " comes from IEA 's projection that U.S. investments in energy efficiency and biofuels will cause our consumption oil to drop gradually from our present 19 mbd to about 12.6 mbd. Half this decline results from efficiency, and half from electrification and biofuels.( These are not guaranteed reductions, but are certainly possible.) <p> These are projections, and often prove far from the mark. But assume they come true -- how good is this news for the American economy, the climate and the environment? <p> The answer is this news is about as bad as it could be -- if we let it come true. Even with fairly dramatic U.S. investments in efficiency and alternative fuels, IEA 's numbers would mean that over the next quarter century the U.S. would transfer $6.5 trillion( one third of our current national debt) of its wealth to oil exporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be bigger than it has been for the past decade ; development prospects in Asia and Africa would be devastated by their inability to pay for basic transportation services ; and, as IEA itself made as its major point, hopes of climate progress would be dashed. <p> But in the Washington Post Robert Samuelson writes, " For starters, the long-standing U.S. trade deficit will narrow and might disappear. In 2011, oil imports represented two-thirds of the deficit in goods. " Well, by 2035 the oil imports deficit would be smaller -- only $170 billion a year, instead of $340 billion. That 's not trivial -- but none of it results from increased domestic oil -- U.S. oil production is actually down in 2035. No, any decline in the oil imports bill for the U.S. over the next quarter of a century is entirely the result of investments we make in efficiency, electrification and alternative fuels. But by doing too little of this, as the IEA expects, we bankrupt our climate, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our oil imports bill actually goes up for the next decade. <p> Instead, we ought to get real and create a global partnership of all the major oil importers to reduce our demand for oil -- if the world used only a little less oil, about 6 percent less, it could cut the price of oil in half, and keep high carbon crudes like Canada 's tar sands in the ground -- it 's paying for that last bit of extreme crude which drives the price of all oil up through the roof. And the sooner we start deploying electric vehicles and more efficient trucks, and lots of them, all over the world, the less damage we will do the climate and the environment on our way to an oil free future. <p> The oil industry is chortling as they read the delusional coverage of the IEA 's 2012 report -- and the media should be red-faced. The rest of us should get on with the biggest economic and environmental opportunity we have ever been handed -- to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovating, not drilling, our way out of oil dependence. <p> What we should not do is be lulled into thinking that our oil dependence crisis has somehow been resolved by some temporary and modest good news on the domestic oil production front. It 's neither big enough nor sustainable enough to change the big picture. <p> A veteran leader in the environmental movement, Carl Pope is the former executive director and chairman of the Sierra Club.

Advances in diesel engine tech came : microwaved air intake, common rail diesel and turbo air injection slashed engine consumption by 50%. the average fleet bus consumes only 110 liters a day., or 26.5 imperial gallons. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardized Mercedes and M.A.N. diesel-hybrid busses- which consume an average of only 14 gallons a day.. The next steps in fuel saving- are using rooftop runoff rainwater, filtering it, and sonic emulsifying it which boosts the water content of diesel in the engine from 10 to a 30%, " aquasol " with an extra ultra-sonic pulse in the air intake.. That lops off - another 20%- or 2.8 gallons less per day,. A second, heatable, insulated water tank to the bus roof - enables additional " aqueous fuel displacement " i.e. brown 's gas- systems feeding into the air intake, and additional- magnetic resonance- steam ionisation- which pre-vaporizes the diesel and mixes it with hot - radically ionized steam, which also ignites-when when mixed with brown 's gas, diesel.( water steamed on the exhaust manifold and magnetic resonance ionized - breaks down to oxygen and hydrogen on the high compression upstroke.with the ultra-sonic pulse-increased-by the cylinder upstroke doppler effect). Triple aqueous fuel systems- emulsion, browns gas, and radical steam ionisation- slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 gallons a day. <p> KentOthoDoering : Energy efficiency- The average 90s Munich bus using a conventional <h> Loading comments... <p> I myself am no fan of " bio ethanol " fuels. Food belongs on the table, and not in the tank. Bio-ethanol requires too much energy to grow, and even more energy to distill. It is " zero gain " energy system that really does not do anything to reduce emissions if you consider the fuel used in growing the stuff, transporting it to bio ethanol plants, grinding and fermenting it, and then, heat distilling it, and transporting that to the refineries to mix into normal fuels. Germany also applies rape seed oil in its blend of Euro-diesel, and many of us think that is even far too wasteful. What are the other alternatives. Here, in transportation, think - energy efficiency. I will cite the example of the Munich public transit bus evolution as but one example. <h> Loading comments... <p> I tend to agree on many points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the only extraction methods available. Another process called Enhanced Oil Recovery- enables retrieving the other 80 % of oil normally left in the ground in conventional drilling. i.e. for the U.S,. that means an additional 360 billion barrels of oil. Secondly, there are enormous reserves of global oil that can be tapped - by fracking. The Russian Baraschnekov field now being opened in Southwest Siberia by Rosneft-Exxon has a dual layer of oil shale like the Bakken field.. and contains anywhere from 500 billion to 2 trillion barrels of oil. Russia will stay number one in oil production I believe. Then, there is the massive East African horn field in South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Kenya that has conventional reserves opening up that match-all the reserves of the Arabian Peninsula and Iran... which can also be fully exploited by conventional, and later enhanced oil recovery techniques. The Europen Union is opening up more North Sea oil, and Greece will be opening its 7.5 billion barrels in concentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt problems while simultaneously " going renewable ". Simultaneous to that, we have all sorts of tehcnologies that slash consumption and emissions- that are already having an effect on keeping oil, coal and gas prices low. <h> Loading comments... <p> It seems as though there is no stable domestic capability any more. It is time we diversify away from oil into wind, solar and Bio fuels. The most important thing that we can do right now is to rethink everything with a focus on efficiency and the elimination of waste. <p> MathewMacLeod : It seems as though there is no stable domestic capability <p> Depends where you produce them and how. In Brazil biofuels are a completely different matter than in the US and even in the US there are cases where biofuels make sense( reusing frying oil, for instance, as a source of bio-diesel and converting biological waste to methane). Having said that, overall, biofuels are not the solution, not even for Brazil. <p> SwiftJonathan : Depends where you produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... <p> Not true. While biofuels from agricultural biomass( i.e. ethanol) is what is most commonly known and argued, at least one company is exploring deriving fuels directly from a waste product, C02, through a process termed artificial photosynthesis. The company 's site claims it can : <p> that is without sugar based biomass, at efficiencies greater than conventional biomass processing( 8,000-15,000 gallons of fuel per acre) at an end cost competitive with fossil fuels( equiv. $55/barrel of oil, $1.28/gal of usable fuel) with scale-up costs lower than other biofuel technologies. The company so far has meant all its milestones and has a commercial prototype plant in New Mexico. The process does require water, sun and waste C02 limiting its application to certain geographic locations, but if it does as advertised, it may be a trend to watch. There are other non-fossil fuel technologies too, which do not use food stock to generate fuel ; among them algal fuels or algae biofuels. Whether they show more promise than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case
