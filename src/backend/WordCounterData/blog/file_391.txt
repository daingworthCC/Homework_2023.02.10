5147341 <p> I 'd advise against it, after seeing Schumer appear on Hardball this afternoon. Host Chris Matthews introduced Schumer as " a strong champion of the public option, " but failed to make much note of the many buckets of water he was hauling on Senator Max Baucus '( D-Mont.) behalf. <p> Schumer began with the good news : sure, the public option failed in the Senate Finance Committee, but once the bill is out in the Senate, it will fare better. Why? Because, according to Schumer, the " most difficult terrain for the public option " is the finance committee because it 's " more conservative than the Senate Democrats as a whole, and the Senate Democrats as a whole are more conservative than the House and the conference. " " This was really good news for us! " Schumer enthused, apparently unaware that Max Baucus and Blanche Lincoln and Kent Conrad do not suddenly become entirely different people just because they 've entered a different room. <p> But that 's Schumer 's outlook! Everything 's going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really awesome " is a public option " trigger! " " There may be some adjustments and tweaks we have to make, " Schumer said. HINT HINT. <p> Watch Sen. Schumer 's appearance on Hardball : <p> Elsewhere, Schumer was just out there, deflecting heat from Baucus, who apparently has n't figured out how to do that by sewing together a thick sheet of insulation out of the thousands of dollars he 's earned from the health care lobby. Chris Matthews showed Schumer this ad, which savages Baucus. In it, Montana resident Bing Perrine describes the extent to which he 's ended up in crippling six-figure debt from treatment of a congenital heart defect and a lack of health insurance. In the ad, Perrine makes his point very clear : <p> " Senator Baucus, when you take millions of dollars from health and insurance interests that oppose reform and oppose giving families like mine the choice of a public option, I have to ask : whose side are you on? " <p> WATCH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confronted with, on the teevee -- draws Schumer 's blithest tsk-tsk : " It 's hurting us. And I wish they would n't do it. " But how does this ad hurt? The ad actually points out the precise reason the public option is foundering : a lot of well-financed special interests are purchasing legislation that eliminates it. That is why the public option is struggling to live. There is no other reason. <p> But Schumer, who has himself raised $1.65 million from the financial services sector, would rather pretend that he lives in a world where all of that money is n't having any sort of impact on lawmaking, and in which pointing that out is hurtful. What 's helping? Schumer says that the polling is what matters : " A New York Times survey found 65% of the public are for the public option. " WOO! Of course, as anyone who 's followed this issue knows, the first and easiest thing that gets dismissed in the health care debate is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why these poll numbers matter now, except as a means of getting Schumer out of this conversation. <p> And really, Baucus could n't ask for a better Gunga Dun than a man who 'll say this on his behalf : <p> SCHUMER : What we have to do is show Max Baucus that we have the votes. Today he said he likes the public option. If he thought there were 60 votes on the floor of the Senate he 'd be for it. <p> This is a mind-blowing example of anti-logic. Surely Chuck Schumer knows that Baucus would be one of those 60 votes. Surely he understands that Kent Conrad and Blanche Lincoln, who also voted against the public option -- voted against his amendment! -- are also two of those 60 votes. I really do n't think Schumer should be allowed to come on teevee and not make sense to the extent he 's not making sense. By his thinking, Max Baucus " likes the public option, " but Max Baucus is playing a wait-and-see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Baucus. If Max Baucus ends up supporting the public option, then Max Baucus can add his support. <p> Schumer, by the way, did n't even attempt to explain why Tom Carper would n't vote for the Rockefeller amendment. At least Max Baucus and Kent Conrad can claim to be from competitive districts. As the Washington Independent ' s Dave Weigel points out today, Carper won his seat by over 40 points. <p> But that 's how the public option is going to die. A bunch of Democrats will vote it down because their seats are too vulnerable. Then, a bunch of Democrats will vote it down because their seats are too safe. The health care industry will have spent its money wisely, and Bing Perrine will hopefully have enough bake sales to pay to fix his heart, so he does n't die.

That frees you to vote your conscience. <p> What makes the president 's actions during the health care debate disturbing is their common thread : If he has values, he does n't want to talk about them, and it 's hard to find many he is n't willing to give up. <p> Congress has the idea that health care reform is a political football game with two clear sides, and the public option a dividing line. But what if very few Americans see the debate through this prism? <p> wdw505- ". i will not pay your way through life nor pay your insurance " <p> Guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in premiums to cover the uninsured. You would rather pay MORE to feel like you are NOT paying for anyone, than actually pay less and have someone other than you benefit from it. Not only does your position lack compassion, it lacks intelligence and fiscal sense. <p> Guess what? Right now we are paying an extra $1100.00 a year to fill the pockets of Insurance CEOs( miilions in bonuses), without receiving any value at all. The greatest cost waste in the current system are the Insurance companies, where the unrestricted profit incentive enable insurance companies to make profits by tens of millions of dollars, without contributing anything and sometimes even actively obstructing needed care of the patient. What health care benefits does a person receive from lining the pockets of CEOs? Profit and Health Care are mutually exclusive. The basic starting point must be a Non-profit structure. I am not necessarily advocating a government run program, although the government has a pretty good track record in Medicare. Another, private or cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be For-profit. Even the insurance companies could create a Non-profit division. The savings in that area alone would save the lives of many who have been denied or can not afford the current premiums. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> Interesting question : if the END result that the President signs( and the more I see, the more I am thinking he plans to sign ANYTHING that is put in front of him, which has me disillusioned) forces a mandate in which you can be charged up to 12% of YOUR ANNUAL INCOME FOR PREMIUMS, it seems to me that the ins cos will offer alot of high-deductible, bare-arse plans so that people will buy those, not being able to afford 12% of income! BUT : what if you are the young guy from Montana in the ad? What if you are a 2-time cancer survivor? People with conditions will, by default, have to pay 12% of income on deductibles alone.
