5134041 <h> Exploring cravings for the gym, healthy food, a happy life and sweet indulgences <h> Back into the swing of things <p> Do n't worry, I wo n't be one of those people simply because I 've had an awesome Monday. I 'm finally back into my usual mid morning gym classes, the bf had a sick day at home and I 'm just simply feeling great! I do have one exam to study for but lets just say it 's only worth 25% and the lecturers have given us very little guidance for what to study... so procrastination is in full force.

I know that 's something I struggle with also. But you know what? That change can bring about new and amazing things, and maybe even things that you end up liking more. <p> It 's okay to feel uneasy about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accept it and then make the best of it.
