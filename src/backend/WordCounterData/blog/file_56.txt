A design of steel, glass and natural stone, this unique Savills property is planned around a large open-plan reception area incorporating a retractable sliding roof, which allows spectacular natural light to illuminate the space. <p> The central courtyard, complete with hot tub and glass-sided swimming pool, is flanked by a dining area, gymnasium and master bedroom suite, with four further bedrooms elsewhere in the property -- two of which share a private garden. The master bedroom suite itself is an amazing example of planning, echoing the layout of the main property on a smaller scale : the bedroom serves as the " courtyard ", with bathrooms either side of it and access a spacious walk-in dressing room. <p> The design may be unmistakably spartan and modern, but Lavender House features plenty of comforts for the whole family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a place for the family to relax together, and there 's a larger entertainment space in the basement, which can function as a media room or a party space. An interesting aspect of the basement, and a further example of the property 's joined-up design, is that it offers high-level windows looking into the swimming pool! <p> The entire property is enclosed by security gates, and while it is discreetly tucked away and out of view from Hampstead High Street, it 's only 50m from the street itself, making it the ideal residence for a family that values its privacy but still wants to live in
