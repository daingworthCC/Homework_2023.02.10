5157741 <p> It would be great to be able to provision disks which can then be attached to either a single cloud server, or maybe even multiple servers. The idea of this is to separate server data from the core OS so that in the event of one server going down, the data and config can simply be attached to a duplicate instance and service can continue. <p> I hear that block storage devices are coming. I 'm desparate, one of my clients needs another 40 or 80 gb partition now in the worst sort of way. When is the launch? Can I get in on a beta test perhaps? <p> We need to be able to park a large amount of data. But very little need for processing power on this particular server. It would be nice to have a low cost solution for this on rackspace - vs having to create an account over on say Amazon :) <p> We have begun working on a Cloud Block Storage solution that will enable customers to scale their storage independently from their compute. As part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Please help by taking this short survey about your block storage needs. Thanks! <p> I see your addressing the storage part of this, but what about RAM? I have a dedicated IIS server and store most of my data in a DB and/or Cloud Files. I do n't need more then the HDD space I have now but I could use a bump up in RAM. <p> One important thing that I hope will be possible with the cloud block storage is the ability to have our databases hosted on that storage... MongoDB, MySQL, etc. Especially for MongoDB... It 's a database that is meant to work with large amounts of data and I ca n't think of any better match because while we can very easily put individual files on S3 or Cloud Files... An actual system like a database is going to just simply need more storage space whether it be on the actual machine or as a separately connected block store. <p> We 'd like to be able to create a drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do our compute in serval places( Asterisk in this case) and then store such things as Call Recordings in another. <p> I 'm perfectly happy to live with less disk space " inside " the machine, if we can connect to a virtual SAN that has good performance and good reliability to the block storage. But you do also need to consider the issue of mounting the same storage on multiple machines, a la GFS. <p> As I discussed with the product team, we would need to be able to mount this block storage on multiple web servers. As a hillbilly workaround we may be able to mount the block storage to an intermediary machine and then mount that one on all the web servers, but it adds
