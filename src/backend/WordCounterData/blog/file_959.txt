5204941 <h> One Small Step at a Time <p> When discussing our carbon footprint and things we can do to reduce it, changing light bulbs always comes up. It seems a lot of folks wonder how changing a light bulb could make much of a difference. <p> Well it 's a lot like those little ants in the video clip, one piece at a time and one small step at a time. Pretty soon those ants have a big pile of sawdust and pretty soon we humans have a huge pile of carbon dioxide that has n't been released into the atmosphere. <p> Consider how many millions of homes there are worldwide. Just for fun let 's say there are 200 million( there are over 110 million in the U.S. alone). <p> Let 's say each home owner changed out just one of their 100 watt incandescent light bulbs with a 23 watt compact fluorescent bulb. Now suppose each bulb was used for just one hour per day. <p> COOL, so what? The national average in 2007 was about 1.4 pounds carbon dioxide emissions for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kWh 's = over 5.1 million tons of CO2 released to the atmosphere annually 1.4 lbs X 1.7 billion kWh 's = over 1.1 million tons of CO2 released to the atmosphere annually Changing that one incandescent bulb to a CFL could reduce CO2 emissions by 4 million tons per year!! <p> Changing that bulb to a LED would reduce the carbon released
