5135441 <p> Just curious, but is anybody paying attention to what just happened in Pakistan? It 's dribbled out in bits and pieces, but I do n't recall anyone putting the whole picture in perspective. <p> Here 's what 's happened. More than a year ago, Asia Bibi, a 45-year-old mother of five, was working in the fields in the Punjab province when some of the Muslim women working alongside her asked her to fetch water. When she returned, several women said they would not accept it because she was a Christian and therefore " unclean. " Insults were exchanged and in the process Bibi made some insulting remarks about the Koran and Islam. <p> The incident blew over at first, but word spread through the town and a few days later Bibi was being pursued by a Muslim mob. The police intervened and rescued her but felt obliged to satisfy the mob 's bloodlust so they charged Bibi with blasphemy. This is a capital offense under a 1979 law. Bibi was held in solitary confinement for more a year until she was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provincial court and sentenced to die on November 9. <p> By now the case was drawing international attention. Christian groups began to protest and Pope Benedict XVI appealed for clemency, complaining that Christians in Pakistan are " often victims of violence and discrimination. " Other minority groups in Pakistan began calling for the repeal of the blasphemy law, saying it was used to persecute all minorities. The execution was postponed. Then in mid-November, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab and apparently a decent man, called for issuing a pardon and said that blasphemy should not be punishable by death. In late November, an aide to President Asif Ali Zardari put out word that a pardon would be forthcoming. All the while, Bibi remained in jail. <p> So on last Tuesday, Governor Taseer, the man who had spoken up for softening the law, was assassinated by one of his own guards. The killer, one Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, said that Taseer had committed blasphemy by siding with Bibi. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but none of the governor 's other guards seemed to make any attempt to stop him. Yesterday when Qadri appeared in court, he was mobbed by a throng of admirers who garlanded him with flowers. Meanwhile, Taseer 's family could n't find a Muslim cleric to preside over his funeral. <p> SO THERE YOU have it. An incident that might take place on a playground in this country becomes an international incident in Pakistan with one of the highest public officials in the land assassinated while the crowds cheer. <p> Press coverage has been typically boring and mealy-mouthed. The Voice of America found the whole thing emblematic of class conflict : <p> Political power in Pakistan has usually rested with an educated, liberal, and often wealthy elite -- at least when the country was not under military rule. With his push to roll back the country 's blasphemy laws, Punjab Governor Salman Taseer epitomized what radicals view as an alarming secular drift in Pakistan. <p> Lisa Curtis, of the Heritage Foundation, of all places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome : <p> " It 's been events over the past 30 years, like the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, the Islamization policies of General Zia ul-Haq during the 1980s, which has really strengthened the Islamist forces and the more puritanical sects in Pakistan over the more traditional and moderate Sunni sects. " <p> Ravi Agrawal, reporting for CNN, explains it all as a reaction to colonialism. <p> Taseer 's political thoughts were forged at his English-style high school in posh Lahore, and then furthered in his time studying accounting in England. Taseer lived and died a Muslim. But he was also modern, with western views on law and democracy. And it was those views that clashed with a country that has increasingly identified itself as Islamic, shedding the anglicized traditions of its colonized past. <p> Sounds like he deserved to die to me. <p> Here 's an alternative explanation to the story. These people are crazy. They live in a world that most Europeans left behind when Hieronymus Bosch hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind somewhere around first grade. I remember well the panic we all felt that year trying to escape some particularly unpopular girl 's " cooties. " After another year, however, the terror subsided. We began to lead rational lives. Not so in the great Islamic Republic. The phobias, irrational fears, superstitions, and delusions that most cultures would ascribe to madness are part of daily life. The place is a lunatic asylum. Thank god they live on the other side of the world. But of course, as 9/11 showed, that 's not really true anymore. And they do have a nuclear weapon, too -- think of that. <p> We are not to blame for Pakistan. As Iraqis have gone on killing each other for the last five years, it was always possible to say that we set the ball rolling by invading in the first place. But Pakistan is sui generis. These people are not rejecting colonialism, they are rejecting civilization. Sunnis kill Shi'ia, Shi'ia kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Then they all get together and murder Christians or someone who can speak English or whoever else happens to be at hand. Me and my cousin against the world. <p> I think we should finish whatever the hell it is we are doing in Afghanistan but then get the hell out. Forget about this " nation-building. " These people are incapable of holding a wedding or a funeral without somebody blowing himself up and taking half the crowd with him. Maybe in some other century we can sit down and talk about a peaceful future. For now, I say let them broil in their own inferno. <p> CORRECTION. The law under which Asia Bibi was charged with blasphemy dates back not to British rule, as reader Dr. Terence Tastard informed us, but to 1979, " and the decision by President Zia Al-Haq to court Islamist support by instituting Sharia law into Pakistan 's legal system. " <h> Vaemar 1.7.11 @ 6:27AM <p> Unfortunately, as Brecht said, you can leave politics alone but politics wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood into the US, we should be offering this unfortunate woman asylum, and, if necessary, as a matter of national honour and solidarity with Christendon and civilization against pagan barbarism, rescuing her with armed force. It would be the best policy in our own ling-term interests, too. <h> David Thompson 1.7.11 @ 11:53AM <p> We SHOULD offer asylum to any civilized person who wants to escape the insanity that is Islamization. But there 's not enough room for the ones who are genuinely civilized, and we ca n't separate those from the radicals who would come with their bombs, guns, and knives. <h> Occam 's Tool 1.7.11 @ 5:47PM <h> DG in GA 1.8.11 @ 11:41AM <p> I find it interesting that we do n't offer asylum to this woman( assuming we could get her out of the country, which is unlikely) but we 'll let every Muslim in the world, regardless of their hatred of our country, to live here and do pretty much whatever they want as long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) <h> Alan Brooks 1.10.11 @ 10:08AM <h> Brian Mc 1.7.11 @ 6:29AM <p> I will never forget when the towers came down and Fox went to reports from the Middle East that showed thousands cheering in the streets. I knew right then who the enemy was ; a religion that those who practice it are( not only) willing to die, but to kill for because it 's all for the greater good. Guilty or innocent does n't matter, since it is all for Allah and his prophet. This is just one more nauseating example of what " submission " will get you, in the long run. Best to be seen bowing your forehead to the ground than wake up dead. What an insipid life these idiots must lead. <h> KyMouse 1.7.11 @ 9:02AM <p> I remember, Brian, even though networks quickly yanked news footage of the so-called Palestinians dancing in the street and handing out candy to children.

Seriously, they are here, and they are being welcomed with open arms by the current administration. Check out the " Islamic schools " and mosques in Virginia which were home to the 9/11 attackers and are still open for business. Jihad, coming soon to a neighborhood near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam - it is NOT up to us to judge these people. God will do that.

It 's about time someone put some common sense thoughts together versus the politcally correct crap that is published every day by the mainstream media. Kudos Mr. Tucker <h> canuckistani 1.7.11 @ 10:54AM <p> I just ca n't believe it took this long for people to realize this..... Facts about Pakistan and the US since 9/11 : 1) Musharraf 's Pakistan was the ONLY state to officially recognize the Taliban regime. Do n't even start on the nuke issue.... 2) ISI actively recruited and trained Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters to undermine India 's secret activities in Afghan 3) The reneging of the Taliban support for the TAPI gas line was the key impetus for putting them on the Junior target list, not harboring Bin Laden. The ISI is against TAPI, Musharraf 's flip-flop was the reason for his repeated assasination attempts in the 2001-2004 period. 4) Karzai and Rumsfeld wanted TAPI to proceed against ISI wishes and the Lahore mafia actively moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vespa scooter " running around Karachi and Islamabad looking for a job before we anointed him president. Rumsfeld 's curious meeting with Turkmen officials in the lead up to the Afghan invasion was revealing. Why was the Sec Def meeting on a gas line agreement? 5) The State department makes a deal with Musharraf - further alienating him from the ISI, to provide cash for his money tree all the way through the civil and military authorities. At the same time, Commerce persuades Wal-mart to add Pakistan to their most favored global-sourcing sites - suddenly making Pakistan go from rogue state to favored-nation, a la Bush 41 and China a decade earlier. 6) Musharraf resists entering the tribal territories and keeps the religious elite at bay in Islamabad. The beginnings of US special forces activities in the tribal areas spurs the ISI to undermine Musharraf even further, Musharraf loses internal support and quits. The army is still loyal and protects him inside his home in Dubai. 7) The whore and bandit Zardari, likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumes his corruption to new levels. His willingness to play ball with the US on the tribal areas infuriates the religious elite even further and creates a schism he will not be able to control. The US reiterates support for the Zardari regime. The Swat massacre is the last straw for the religious elite. 8) The religious elite begin to undermine Zardari 's power base by playing on religious differences and stirring up resentment even more in the Lahore and Karachi zones. The Christian 's blasphemy charge is the fuse and the ruse leading to the assasination of the Punjabi governor. <p> The religious problems run VERY deep in Pakistan, probably moreso than any other place on earth. Pakistan is considered to be the most Islamic - including Saudi, and their imbedded hatred of infidels, mainly Shi'a, underpins everything in that country. It will boil over. <p> Like our psychosis over Cuba, their suspicion and distrust of India is pathological in nature, and should help us to properly measure their reliability as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pakistan in business, you must ensure your BS detector is on full at all times. It is a cultural defect that they will look you in the eye and lie with a smile on just about everything. <h> OleSarge 1.7.11 @ 11:01AM <p> " In my dealings with Pakistan in business, you must ensure your BS detector is on full at all times. It is a cultural defect that they will look you in the eye and lie with a smile on just about everything. " <h> canuckistani 1.7.11 @ 12:25PM <p> No, they prefer to find a useful idiot to do that for them. Zardari 's complicity in his wife 's murder is probably the most under-reported issue here. Disgraceful and horrifying if the rumors are true, and we continue to underwrite these guys. The Swat massacre was #2 and the lynchpin to the next escalation of religious BS. <h> Alex 1.8.11 @ 6:29AM <p> Hey Sarge, You know what? They say the same about us. <p> They say, they helped us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when they needed us when India attacked them in ' 71, we were nowhere. Again they helped us defeat the Soviets in 80 's and how did we reward them? We put sanctions on them for pursuing nukes. <p> After 9/11 we again go to them seeking their support against the Talibans, the same guys who we trained to help us disintegrate the Soviets in 80 's. And now when they 're doing that, we tell them you 're not good enough. <h> Text man 1.8.11 @ 6:38AM <h> Vijay Dandapani 1.7.11 @ 6:42AM <p> Mr, Tucker is right but did not finish the thought. Leaving them to " broil in their own inferno " includes stopping all aid, civilian and military to Pakistan ; something the US has not done since the 50s. Thats a good thing but never will happen given fears in the US of unintended cinsequences <h> Maha 1.7.11 @ 6:49AM <p> Sir! I do n't know from where i should start. If you are shocked to see people hailing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also from that other side of the world which is called Pakistan. It made me sick too and many Pakistanis are also disgusted with this behaviour of their own countrymen who have brought us shame and condemnation from the whole world. I do n't blame you for perceiving as fanatics when you see such things. Just want to tell you that among such inhuman people who are blinded by their religion, there are some humans living as well. Yeah i am from the same liberal class that west often hears. We are in minority. Taseer death has not ended the hope of liberal Pakistan. His death has actually started this journey and it will be a long struggle. It will take time but surely one day you will see this human side of Pakistan. <p> I will rather ask you to check our newspapers. You will find some humans as well. <h> Pelligtino 1.7.11 @ 9:37AM <p> However, you do not have world 's of time to get it right. I want your country to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and the Pakistani national team( men 's field hockey, too). <p> Your country is a mess. It is thoroughly untrustworthy. <p> And we Americans get weary of aiding after events like the Christmas earthquake of 2004 and the recent massive floodings of last year... only to see you deny our freely given, lifesaving aid to the minority Christians while kicking us in the teeth. <p> And while your military apparatus fakes aiding our war on Islamic terrorist while aiding our enemy with intel on NATO and US forces ' operations. <p> Our patience is not without end. <p> I call on no more dimes to be spent on your lost land. <p> I trust that our Pentagon has plans to invade and secure your nuclear weapons arsenal. And I trust that our next president will have the simple wisdom to know that this is most likely what will need to occur. <p> I wish it were not so. But I have not seen a good Pakistan in my lifetime. <h> David W 1.7.11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. My " response " is how do we get your views to become the predominant ones? I see the US media talking to Muslim " moderates " and yet when we read the non-politically correct news about these moderates they are no different than the murderers( they just use words instead of a gun or explosives to achieve their goals). I know there are Muslims( both male and female) who would be willing to be friends with a white Christian male like me. But they seem to almost be afraid to do that? And when we see the honor killings( one happened in the Dallas area not long ago) and refusal to allow seeing eye dogs in Muslim driven cabs or to have people with " service dogs " threatened because Muslims around them are offended by the presence of the dogs how can we believe that there is rational thought amongst Muslims( and let 's not forget the accusation that Israel has trained sharks to kill Muslims and vultures/pigeons to spy on Saudi Arabia/Iran). The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do respect non-Muslims). <h> Richard Ong 1.7.11 @ 11:01PM <p> I read one page at one of the dawn.com links above and clicking on the home tab resulted in some suspicious behavior. I 'm having anti-virus program difficulties now. May not be related but advise you to follow any of those links. <p> Actually, it is n't known that Asia bibi insulted Mohammed or the Koran. The women went and complained to a local mullah 's wife and from there, the whole thing blew up. Even Pakistanis think it is unlikely in the dangerous climate for minorities that a minority will insult the Prophet or Koran - knowing that its legally punishable by death and while higher courts overturn verdicts, mob justice usually gets the accused after being set free. <p> The law against blasphemy is not from the British Era. In fact, when Pakistan was founded, it was n't intended to be a Muslim state, but a secular democracy where all religions would be welcome, even if the country had been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan). The blasphemy law, the sharia courts, the other repressive laws like the one on adultery, etc we can thank Pakistan 's first military dictator General Zia for. Overnight, Pakistan became a sharia country, but not, because it was supposedly still a democracy with all its frills. <p> Pakistan 's end began soon after its birth, when Badshah Khan - Gandhis friend and the founder of the non-violent Khilafat movement, who opposed the creation of a separate state for Muslims was persecuted and the non-violence movement outlawed. The only reason for this was that Badshah Khan was well respected in India, even though he swore total loyalty to the newly created nation. This man had been hailed all over the world, but persecuted in his motherland, jailed many times. Yet, in a country where it is a norm for politicians leaving their roles to move out of the country, he lived and died in Pakistan. <p> He was Pashtun and in death, he asked to be buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees by the violence in Afghanistan, perhaps readers may appreciate that both sides called for a voluntary ceasefire for his funeral. This is what Pakistan had, but threw away as it stepped on a path of dominance rather than freedom. It was the first step toward hate. <p> The inhuman laws and crazy mullahs and all came after that. <p> From then on, its been downhill, with ' anti-India ' and later ' anti-west ' providing direction for change rather than the wishes of the people. <h> WeMustResist 1.8.11 @ 8:18AM <p> Thank you Vidyut for your insights. It seems that the level of hate and dishonesty in Pakistan is so high that the West would be better off by sending Pakistan to quarantine. The less exchange we have with the corrupt the less chance of misfortune coming our way. We do not gain enough from our relationship with Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen or Afghanistan to justify diplomatic relations, business dealings or normal immigration dealings. A good doctor tries to get poison out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not help those nations and they can only hurt us. Leave them alone- let them stay as far away from us as possible. <h> Appleby 1.7.11 @ 7:02AM <p> This week an Oppressed Minority was found driving through Ottawa( our capital) with an IED in his car. The Coptic churches in the GTA were surrounded by police due to threats by Islamists( who are NOT half a world away) who had already blown up Coptic churches and were threatening to do the same for Christmas everywhere in the world, including here in Toronto. <p> Yesterday there were 9 pages of hysterical reporting in our local newspaper about the horror of the Canadian Junior Hockey Team being shellacked by the Russians and merely obtaining a silver medal. <h> Pelligrino 1.7.11 @ 9:52AM <p> Appleby, I do appreciate the many comments I see you make. Thank you for this as well, as I will look to see about what occured in Ottawa. <p> I hate to tell you that your land seems a real magnet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Turkmenistan -- on long-term green card in the US. She was at a Univ. of South Carolina school. Despite seeming to truly enjoy all the decadences of western lifestyle and her freedoms to date any boy she wanted, she longed for a more rigid Islamic environment. <p> All true. I thought her daft, but I listened and just recorded her impressions and plans. <p> Living near Charleston with a clan of two dozen from her country( the only one who seemed to be full-time employed was her ' engineer ' father), she stated that she was a semester away from fleeing to a better Islamic land.... <p> Canada. Specifically Toronto because her sister informed her that it was much better there. <h> Stephanie 1.7.11 @ 7:03AM <p> Maha, if you are genuine, thank you.

They are distinctly in the minority in a country where 1) there are thousands of people who will kill Maha for disagreeing with the majority 's view ; 2) all too many of whom are in government ; 3) so Maha can not count on official protection and/or action against those who would kill Maha ; and 4) nations like the United States bring little or no pressure on the government to change any of these things - instead, we insist the majority is, by and large, as sane as Maha. <h> missbosslady 1.7.11 @ 6:02PM <p> I am following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock rippling among liberals. I also see many of the educated class of Pakistan stop defending and excusing and ignoring in favour of confronting the problems - for the first time. I can see what you mean by " long struggle ", but I believe that it would be worth it. <p> I wish you and your country the strength and courage to stand by this new path that seems to be unfolding. <h> Nick 1.7.11 @ 2:58PM <p> JamesJ, <p> Ha-ha! <p> " Tonight, on the al Cosbi-Mutallah Show, Heathcliff-Malik 's wife, Claire-Fatima, and her friends, get into an argument with a Christain woman at the local grocery store.

On the other hand, what degree of force would the Pakistanis have to use against us to get you to consider that option( say Islamic radicals smuggled some Hiroshima sized bombs and hid them inside large enough medical device containers( this is, of course, the plot of The Rings of Allah, which was written by a nuclear weapons expert)). <p> How many cities would it take to have our President essentially forced to use Maximum force?

When the world was in the situation of the US vs USSR, we had two superpowers, once of which was evil, but both of which were rational. Mutual assured destruction was a deterrent. That equation will not work if one of the nations with nuclear weapons is under the control of irrational fanatics, particularly religious apocalyptic.

But unfortunately we all live in a drive up window mentality now, in that the world wants immediate results right now. Pakistanis are no different than anyone else. Yes, they have their unique culture, but give a Pakistani an education, become acclimated to the rule of law, and democracy or better yet how to develop a society that has a representative form of government rather than a true democracy, then he or she is just like anyone else. But at least to me, just because a Pakistani learns these things does n't necessarily mean that he is rejecting of what a Pakistani is and embracing a Western lifestyle. I 'll take a guess here, but that is what I think what many rank and file Pakistanis are afraid of. If they get an education that they will reject all things Pakistani.

The Left loves to tout that the White man massacred the American Indian, but truth be told the American Indian was doing a pretty good job of doing that on their own, without the White mans help. The White colonialists just taught the American Indian to be more efficient at it.

But oh no let a white man do somehting he is considered the most ruthless bastard on the planet. Just look to the United Nations its chock full of prolific murderers representing the Jihad against the White Boy. <h> JimH 1.7.11 @ 1:51PM <p> Actually when you think of deaths historically, Native Americans may be considered responsible for the deaths of many millions after early explorers brought back tobacco and syphilis from the new word. <h> Richard Ong 1.7.11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it so well! Let 's flee that area of the world that is the hall of mirrors at the entrance to hell. Were the lives of thousands of Americans, our young people, and all our treasure worth the sacrifice? So some woman in a shroud can VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME????? What an outrage that our young men have become maimed or died because we would like MALIK to experience.... democracy? I do n't give a rat 's ass if they kill each other off and eat the carrion. I care about my countrymen first. And there is not a life over there worth dying for. They are primitives, they are brigands, they are what they are. We could never impose our values on them. But we died trying. What a waste of lives. What a tragic shattering waste to die for such as these. Let them all kill each other. Or we should, should they threaten us anymore. When will we finally take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smithereens?

Bush and his neocons sold us a lie about the rop ; it 's time to pull out and let them have it out between themselves ; stop Muslim immigration ; close down mosques and explain that SEDITION is a treasonous offense, punishable by law ; they are n't going to hide between the First Amendment to grow their creeping sharia in our country.

" Mr. Tucker, I lived for quite some years in NYC, Brooklyn to be specific. I can not quote numbers, but can certainly direct you to sections of the borough where you might need to look at a street sign to remember where you are. Many Islamic countries are represented, not just those in South Asia. My experience was in a section where many were from the Balkans. The KLA recruited aggressively and openly during my time there. Storefront mosques abound, and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course makes the Victory mosque plans all that more suspicious( considering it 's business district location) far away from the communities in Queens, Brooklyn and Harlem. It is not unusal for women arriving from the Middle East, South Asia etc. in the latest stages of pregnancy and being rushed via taxi from JFK to city hospitals to deliver " New Americans " As a former employee of one, I worked in the " diaspora " and can relate some interesting anecdotes. Nowhere near as mad as Pakistan, but a growing story that continually goes unreported. Give the " situation " here and in Western Europe, this has been and will continue to be disastrous. <h> Intelligent Design 1.7.11 @ 7:51AM <p> Nothing could be more hostile to our Constitution and freedom. Islam should be identified by Congress as a subversive organization. Mosques should be outlawed in the U.S., immigration of Muslims should be permanently banned, Muslims should be banned from U.S. airports and airplanes, Muslims should not be allowed to serve in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should be shut down. The goal of Islam and mainstream Muslims is to destroy our freedom, replacing our government with a " religious " dictatorship, such as the current government of Saudi Arabia. For those who do n't know : Saudi Arabia 's constitution is the Koran, its law is shari'a, and the practice of any " religion " other than Islam is prohibited in Saudi Arabia. Non-Muslims are even banned from their " holy " cities of Mecca and Medina. This is what Muslims want to install in the U.S.. They use our Bill of Rights to further their cause, while at the same time their goal is to kill freedom. Islam belong in the 7th century. <h> Intelligent Design 1.7.11 @ 8:05AM <p> In case the above is n't clear, Muslims want the rest of us to submit to Islam, to surrender our freedom in the name of 7th century idiocy. Suggested readings : The Grand Jihad by Andrew McCarthy, Reflections on the Revolution in Europe by Christopher Caldwell, The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in the October 2010 issue of Commentary magazine titled " 20 Years of the Rushdie Rules " by Daniel Pipes. <p> True religions oppose evil ; Islam embodies evil. It is comparable to Nazism and Soviet Communism. Will the new Ronald Reagan place stand up and identify Islam as an evil force? <h> martin j smith 1.7.11 @ 7:58AM <p> I think to be fair the US Constitition should be read in every house or worship in this country and that would include mosques--well that is a joke really. But the real issues of seriousness is the Socialist, Marxists, Left 's flirtation and love affair with Radical Islam. And here is the real story : Sharia Law. The Left will encourage it. Do they realize what they are doing to this country? Some do and some do not. But those that do and these are the hard core, the Soros backed leadership( I mean morally and financially backed) know very well what they are doing. Their idea is to destroy this country period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but at some point very soon --in less than one year the real dirty truth about what the conflict is about in our country. The Left Core who develop the policies are not naive incompetents. They are our enemy within and the Tea Party, Conservatives and others will have a major challenge on their hands : Do they call it as it really is or do they go on to claim these folks are just incompetent boobs? Events may overtake time to decide and there may be little time but to go for it. I 'll give you an example : A manjor instance of Islamic family violence or even Political hit killing in our country which is let pass because it is supported by Sharia Law. What say you now? <h> Intelligent Design 1.7.11 @ 8:11AM <p> It 's incredible how the left fumes over Sarah Palin 's benign religious faith, while at the same time it preaches " tolerance " of Islam, the embodiment of evil. Obama and the rest of the Demo Socialists flunk the IQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid and comfort to the enemy. <h> Bob Grant 1.7.11 @ 9:35AM <p> Convienant excuse to shill for Sarah Palin... not to get off topic too much but Sarah Palin 's religion will not be the ammunition she provides to the left that will take her down, hopefully not the republican ticket. <p> Her demonstrated lack of judgement, temperament, and ability to lead will be what brings her down. <h> Intelligent Design 1.7.11 @ 12:03PM <p> Palin is just an example. The left despises Christianity in general, but of course Lefties all pretend to be church-goers when running for office. Even B. Hussein Obama is a church-goer...... what a crock! Palin is n't qualified to be president, and would lose if nominated, but she is more qualified than Obama. <p> Despite the long bloody track record of Islam, the Left is more receptive to a mosque in NYC than a cross at some makeshift memorial to veterans in East Overshoe. <h> Bob Grant 1.7.11 @ 12:31PM <p> There is nothing more offensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of " social justice ". With the consent of an approving media : <p> *African American churches becomming nothing more than polling stations and venues for political rallies * Pro abortion Norheastern liberals using the Catholic Church for political ends. e.g., sitting in the front pew( hopefully in front of a camera), taking communion knowing full well it 's in direct violation of Canon Law <p> Just a couple of examples. They want to render Religion meaningless, like the constitution. Whatever the constitution or Religion means to the individual is all that matters. <p> Let 's not forget, however, that Palin wont be the only Christian running in the republican primary. <h> Bob Grant 1.8.11 @ 5:29PM <h> Melvin 1.7.11 @ 8:11AM <p> The first step is to have a societal acknowledgement that we are at war with Islam. But, are we at war with Islam or are we at war with a bunch of manipulative Bastards, who shield their true political intentions by hiding behind Islam. Hitler used the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who are hiding behind Islam are no different. <h> The Big E 1.7.11 @ 11:46AM <p> Regardless of whether we believe we are at war with Islam, Islam is at war with us. It has been since its founding. It will be till its destruction. If you do n't believe me, read the Koran for yourself. <h> Melvin 1.7.11 @ 11:49AM <p> I do n't doubt for one second your analysis. But what I am looking for who is controlling the snake. We can beat this snake to death till we are blue in the face but until we get to the head and chop it off, we are going to continue to have to deal with the snake. <h> Richard Ong 1.7.11 @ 7:31PM <p> The head of the snake is the passages in the Koran and the teaching of all eight schools of Islamic " jurisprudence " that mandate death for apostasy. Islam is such a backward and oppressive political and social system that erstwhile " Muslims " would depart from it by the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Mr. Taseer 's death and Ms. Bibi 's sentence of death show even the most ridiculous charge of disrespect of Mohammed( such as laying an outdated calendar with Koranic verses on a table top) will be acted upon by the lunatics. Muslims who do not formally swear that the Koran is in error, Mohammed was in error, and all eight schools are in error are ipso facto active supporters of a doctrine of murder and have no place anywhere in the world, especially not in the West. <p> Allow Muslims in our midst and you have the perfect engine for murder and subversion( replacement of the Constitution with the shariah). <h> Mitch Angoop 1.7.11 @ 11:55AM <p> It is certainly anathema to EVER utter the horrible word " NUKE " but that may be the only thing in our arsenal that could save us. Of course barry the muslim has sworn he 'll never use them, and our 111th congress assured our destruction by ratifying the latest joke of a START treaty. <p> Yes, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 've said it so do n't come back and tell me I 'm a monster. But... When our own stupidity and cowardice comes back to bite us, the only thing we 'll have is the slightest threat that we 'd ever use them. I love the lefties who try to dishonor the U.S. as the only nation that ever used them ; but the use of nukes saved an estimated one million American lives because we did n't have to invade Japan in 1945. <p> Now, all it would take is to make it the official policy of the U.S. that any attack on The United States of America by any muslim organization or country be considered an act of war which will bring on full nuclear retaliation on Mecca first ; then Medina, and from there on to the capitals and military targets of muslim countries. We know who these people are and what they 're doing. We just do not have the guts to do anything about it. These people have been clear : Their objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us as they can. Stop the deadly denial. <h> Mitch Angoop 1.7.11 @ 3:26PM <p> Are you more concerned about an atheist who sees this as the pinnacle of his/her existence and wants to get as much as possible out of life since there is nothing afterwards? Or, would a muslim fanatic just lusting for death/martyrdom and his 72 virginians be a little more likely to ' push the button ' should he have the chance? <p> I 'm more afraid of the muslim fanatic. Actually, ANY kind of a fanatic scares me because they have no logic and simply can not understand a reasoned argument. <h> Bob Grant 1.7.11 @ 3:57PM <p> MAD worked beautifully against the Soviets for the reasons you explained, i.e, their life on Earth is the pinnacle of his/her existence. <p> However, your proposed policy against Muslim countries would quickly devolve into a quasi MAD scenario because terrorists would realize they have ONE shot at us before every one of their holy sites, capitols, military targets, etc. would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign from Allah to prepare for and initiate a " final " battle to fulfill some prophesy. <p> If you want to go down that path, we might as well just hit them at some random time like a " thief in the night ". <p> I 'm just saying a warning such as what you are proposing would have the opposite effect of what you are seeking. <h> Bob Grant 1.7.11 @ 3:59PM <h> Mitch Angoop 1.7.11 @ 7:30PM <p> No worries Man, I used " virginians " intentionally after an old joke but nobody noticed. Without being cavalier, the possibility of some muslim fanatic with a nuke is terrifying beyond belief. Because of their past behavior I 'd put nothing past them and would take them out in a ' pre-emptive ' strike as soon as any threat was verified. Not a second 's hesitation. These are very dangerous times we are in. <h> Cerebrate 1.7.11 @ 8:24AM <p> William Tucker might as well have garlanded the murderer with petals and cheered him on. There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hate mongers. He reports about the 100 admirers of the murdered showering him with petals but petals were also laid on the grave of Salman Taseer by 6000 Muslims.

Well, maybe he does know it and is constantly looking the other way. Until we change our government, its mannerisms, and its purpose, we will live under the threat of Islam. I believe we need to change the way we look at Islam-it is a threat and no good can come from it. Europe has undergone many tremendous changes in the last 20 years, to the point that the majority of entitlement reciepents are Muslim, that most of the crime committed is by Muslims, that the police does n't enforce the law, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want to live in the kind of world that Islam brings. I certainly do n't want my daughters living that way and do n't want them contending with Islamic law. Yes, those masses hide behind Islam. <p> What is the proper solution? Most of you know what it is. Good luck gentlemen and gentleladies, our government could n't care less what happens to us. I do. <h> Asif Abbasi 1.7.11 @ 8:48AM <p> Being a Pakistani myself, i think this is a view of ground from 10,000 feet above. Just like you can not get the actual picture from such a height, similarly you can not decipher the truth sitting a continent apart. Weather or not the motive was Religious is yet to be found out. People have been citing the murder has political. <p> Secondly, Blasphemy law is a law in Pakistan. You guys can not judge weather a particular law in another country is good or bad, reason being, its the Democracy and the people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this law is unfit for our needs, we will elect people who will abolish it. As of now, it is perfect, to keep religious harmony among the people, and stop people from inciting restlessness in society. <p> Now lets come to the current situation of Pakistan, and how it has landed in the situation where it is now. Pakistan from the moment it gained independence has been at the mercy of American policy makers, who had times and again used ' This land of Pure ' to its own advantages. The reason was pretty simple : Initially to keep a lid on Soviet union, and now to make sure China does n't get away with so much budget surplus of trillions of dollars, and controlling the reserves in Afghanistan and Central Asia. <p> As of now Pakistan is the hub of terrorist activities from CIA, Mossad and Raw. Funding to the religious groups have been provided directly by India, and a number of Taliban captured in Swat and Waziristan have been found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place. Upon interrogation, they have been found to be agents from these intelligence agencies. I feel sorry for you believing what is shown on your Television screens, and thinking that truth is what you see. If you ask me, Pakistan is one of the bravest nations in the world. No one in the world can walk around, admist suicide bombings, but Pakistanis have still be hanging around. Give them credit for this at least. They have still been producing worlds finest doctors, engineers, computer scientists, pilots, businessmen etc. <p> And finally when you said, you should do your business in Afghanistan and go away, i think you are hugely mistaken my friend. USA is here to stay. The energy reserves in Afghanistan and Central Asia are too big for US to leave this country. Even in Iraq, you handed the govt to USA puppets, energy reserves to US Companies, and then gave partial control back to Iraqis. Afghanistan is actually a gold mine, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... <h> Melvin 1.7.11 @ 9:44AM <p> Loulou like it or not the man is correct. Afghanistan and Pakistan are one big giant mining operation. Does it suck, well it depends on which side of the ocean your on. The stuff that is requiring certain minerals are only found in certain places. China is already using minerals as a strategic weapon. Russia is as well. Both Russia and China would both love to put us in a hurt-locker defense wise. Now this notion of why ca n't everyone just get along..... To perfectly be honest, I personally gave that up a long time ago. There will always be the tyrannical bad guys who are bent on forcing their will on everyone. The world has never gotten along since the beginning of time when man first walked upon the earth. And I finally concluded that it never will. <h> Asif Abbasi 1.9.11 @ 8:36AM <p> Would you kindly explain if killing a governor is barbarism who supposedly said something bad, or killing innocent civilians via drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have n't seen you guys speaking loudly about that. How about you guys being perpertrators of terrorism, and spending your tax money on killing those innocent civilians for the sake of energy and protecting your coming generations and at the behest of Oil Conglomerates???? <h> macon 1.7.11 @ 9:09AM <h> Amor de Cosmos 1.7.11 @ 10:33AM <p> Asif, you are nuts. You swallowed every piece of Arab propaganda there is. <p> Blasphemy laws that result in capital punishment. Are you serious? Are you civilized? <p> What kind of country can claim to be tolerant and liberal when it allows such things to be on its law books. Get out of the conspiracy echo chamber that pervades Islamic countries( and the " self pitying " poor us, we are pawns in America and the Zionists ' game " and the 8th century. <h> MikeD 1.7.11 @ 12:00PM <p> Remember, any reference to any form of ' democracy ' will never be found in any translation of the koran or the sharia law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dictatorship or religious oligarchy.

I hate to tell you but technology has bridged that divide. Unfortunately, the primitives of the Middle East do n't know it yet. <p> Big, bad America is not the problem. No, no. America is just the straw man for every oppressive middle eastern regime.

What possible tenets could they point to that ought to be admired and practiced. I suspect that there are many out there that would like to leave but are afraid. We should do everything we can to make it safe for them to do so. <h> martin j smith 1.7.11 @ 10:56AM <p> Lets talk about human rights. And, I have no question that my view of this topic is from a Western perspective--big deal that is who I am. Lets say female is sentenced to stoning to death for looking at the wrong person.

It may be their law but I do not have to like it or respect it and I can within the confines of this country( USA) support those who protest its being carried out and, if it applies to boycott such a nation or at least have some form of condemnation. But within this country I believe we should not allow any group for any reason to have a large parallel legal system I wil give an example : Very religious( Hasidic for example) jews may have a religious judicatation of the marital problems but if a person male or female kills, sexually abuses or in anyway breaks our secular laws within our legal system they are tried by our system just as anyone else. As I understand it, this would not be true in Sharia law. Thus i am opposed to this. <h> davelnaf 1.7.11 @ 11:17AM <p> What the author says about Pakistan is true, to one degree or another, of the entire Muslim world. <p> But Pakistan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more can one say about its level of dysfunction that its nuked-up paranoia over India 's alleged nefarious designs does n't say far more eloquently?

The biggest difference between these two countries is that Islam dominates every aspect of life in one of them. <p> Nation-building is never going to succeed in Afghanistan. To begin with the Afghans are just too backward. They may have a trillion dollars ' worth of mineral wealth, but the average Afghan will never see a penny of it.

Modern ' liberalism ', synonymous with ' Progressivism ', has devolved into a form of Marxism which in fact embraces the philosophy of an all powerful state, and should be re-labeled as such. <p> Pakistan was a bad idea from the start. It was a sop to the the ego of the disturbed M.

The only thing that civilizes the Stone Age is time, and while there are a minority of enlightened souls in these Muslim countries, most of them are living and thinking in the Stone Age. <h> George True 1.7.11 @ 9:16PM <p> You make a good point, Bob. Culturally, the German and Japanese peoples were civilized prior to fascist/imperialist regimes taking over their countries. <p> If a fringe group of people calling themselves Christians started blowing up Jews or Muslims in any Western countries, real Christians would hunt them down relentlessly. Real Christians would be vehemently denouncing them from the pulpits and staging mass rallies against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not do this against the radical Muslims who preach and commit violence tells me all I need to know about their culture. <h> Richard Baker 1.7.11 @ 1:20PM <p> Fred : So tell me. Where are the Episcopalian, Baptist, or Lutheran suicide bombers/assassins?( By the way, the Assassins were a Shia terror sect in the 11th-13th Century). Must have missed those stories in the paper. Had n't heard those ministers were advocating the wholesale slaughter of those who disagree with their faith. Maybe you need to start taking medication, instead. <h> Musl Pak 1.7.11 @ 1:44PM <p> Dear all, I 'm indeed dismayed to read all the hate mail coming out from the representatives of the ' civilized ' West( or so they seem to be). Although my few words may not change the skewed opinion of most of you guys, formulated over the years, from seeing biased news coverage of remote incidents unduly projected as norms ; but for the record let me say this. 1. Religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion. Muslims and Christians have justified their actions in history in the name of their religions. Ironically all believe in the same God but fight over Him as well. So please pressurize your government to pull out your forces from Afghanistan where they are perceived as occupational force first and foremost. Stop planning to snatch the mineral resources of that region. Request for them and you 'll get them. 2. About Pakistan, it 's a country only 63 years young and still evolving. Just think where was US 63rd year into its existence? Civil War was round the corner. 3. In Pakistan, Muslim majority lives generally in peace with their Christian, Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis and other minorities. But this does not make sellable sensational news for the World. Only one odd unfortunate incident of hate crime or injustice makes headline news thereby tarnishing the country 's overall image and creating loath for her in the hearts of the westerners. 4. Two wrongs do n't make a right. Violence only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about more war and killing. Support Pakistan 's silent majority in prevailing over the violent radical minority. This nation is not a cesspool of decadence. 5. Lastly, Peace and Patience is the only way out for this world. Otherwise the humanity as a whole is doomed. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 2:56AM <p> Missboss, These are very complicated matters where nothing is black or white. <p> I 'll maintain that Islam does not teach violence. I suggest you to read Koran in totality and not take its statements out of context. <p> About love and warmth from Middle East, please come for yourself in the countries there and you 'll be pleasantly surprised see how much welcomed you 'll generally feel. Do n't jump to conclusions on reading a few ill meaning articles. <h> missbosslady 1.8.11 @ 10:24AM <p> Perhaps you could tell by my posting name that I am a woman. What possible allure could there be for a woman to go anywhere near the Mid East? <p> As a female I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might ever step foot in a muslim nation is ZERO. <p> You have no chance of convining me to appreciate the religion or the region. There is nothing that you could ever say that would stop me from daily thanking God that I, as a woman, was born in the United States. I have an interesting life story that I know, without any doubt, would have been impossible anywhere but here. <p> No woman, with an ounce of self-respect could be attracted to a religion or land that holds them in such low regard. <p> We have the instant case of vigilantism as well as one where a policeman dispatched a man accused of " blasphemy " with a hammer while the accused was lying in his hospital bed. I say this is par for the course there these days. If you tell me it was n't so before Zia came on the scene, fine. Make that case, though I 'll bet it was an artifact of British thinking that persisted after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wildly un-Islamic. <h> George True 1.7.11 @ 1:54PM <p> Musl Pak : I am sure you are sincere in what you are saying. Unfortunately, Islam does preach violence, and it always has. Such is codified in the Koran. Furthermore, it is questionable whether Muslims are worshiping the same God as other religions. Any alleged holy book that exhorts its followers to kill and/or subjugate any who are not co-religionists can not be from the God who created the universe. Muslims are unwittingly worshiping he who rebelled against God. The only way the violence will ever end is to acquaint every Muslim with this inescapable fact, <h> Musl Pak 1.7.11 @ 2:20PM <p> Dear George, Thank you for your response. I 'm glad you aired your views and gave me a chance to clarify this perception. I 've read Koran and have tried to look for exactly what is mentioned by you and many others like you in this world. Please be rest assured Koran does not teach violence or forceful conversions. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken in isolation or out of context and a complete inference drawn on it, but to say that Koran codifies violence is indeed incorrect. About your comments whether we all believe in the same God. Well the God of Adam is the God of Noah and the God of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and finally of Mohammed. Through out history and even before these religions were born, men have been fighting and the three main causes have been women, wealth or land. I do n't seen Crusades as a fight between two religions, these were wars purely fought for economic interest between Europeans and Arabs ; and Gods two religions were twisted in such a way so as to make a common man on both sides, fight for a cause dear to his heart and what better cause than his religion. My friend, we need to rise above these petty differences and defeat the few evil conspirators amongst us who thrive on division and destruction of us gullible majority. Peace be with all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. After all we are children of the same God. <h> Occam 's Tool 1.7.11 @ 6:54PM <p> Seems to me the Crusades definitely were religion centered, quotes : Abu Huraira reported Allah 's Messenger( may peace be upon him) as saying : The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say : Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me ; come and kill him ; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.( Sahih Muslim, 41:6985 ; see also 41:6981-84 and Sahih Bukhari, 4:52:176,177 and 4:56:791) <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 3:09AM <p> Occam, <p> I 'm so glad that you gave me this opportunity. If the West 's despise for Islam is based on this quote then let me tell you, its taken out of context. <p> First of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadith ', something that Prophet Mohammed reportedly said to one of his friends Abu Huraira. So Koran is certainly out of this now. In those days Islam was struggling to make a mark in Arabia and was naturally being resisted by Jews who were the predominant force in the region especially trade and commerce. This was the time of battles where the few followers of Islam were struggling to survive. In such a challenging situation this statement was quoted by one of Mohammed 's companions to somehow pep up the sagging morale of his fellow Muslims. Again as I have been saying earlier, please get your facts right and see the whole picture. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 3:20AM <p> Bob, Assuming that Osama Bin Laden is the real deal here and not some implant or escape goat, let me say this <p> " I condemn Osama Bin Laden for the heinous acts of terrorism he has committed in the name of my religion Islam. His acts of terrorism have no religious or moral justifications and hence would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of saying that with his acts he has done no service to Islam or its followers. Infact he has played into the hands of conspirators who want to draw a wedge between the two great religions of the world and their naive and good followers. Now who are those conspirators, benefactors or third parties( to say the least) who are benefiting from this divide is anyones guess. <p> For your part you can begin with condemning the invasion your government did of Iraq and Afghanistan on the pretext of making this world a safer place to live and in the process killed tens of thousands of innocent people if not hundreds of thousands. Can you condemn your ex-President for that who I 'll refer not as a Christian here cause then there will be no difference between your and my thinking. <h> Musl Pak 1.7.11 @ 2:35PM <p> Dear Ken, Your use of unparliamentary language speaks volume of your personality. But should I generalize this kind of attitude for all Christians? Certainly not. <p> Sorry for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in. Again you are confusing culture with religion. Please tell me in which civilized country do you, as a custom, shake hands with your left hand? <p> As Mr. Schulze said it rightly ; there are extremists in all religions of the world including Islam and Christianity. This does not essentially make these religions bad. So next time you wan na ask a question on any religion do n't go running to a fanatic. <h> idalily 1.7.11 @ 3:04PM <p> Sorry, Musl, but you can not separate culture from religion in countries that allow no other religion the right to free speech and practice. In nearly all Islamic nations today, your religion is your culture, and your culture derives from your religion. You can not, at this point in history, separate them. Nice try. <h> Musl 1.7.11 @ 3:25PM <p> Idalily, Islam is a major religion in countries spread across North Africa, Middle East, South Asia( about 170 Mio in India too), Central Asia and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not Saudi Arabia, Iran or Pakistan. It is Indonesia. If you mean to say that all these countries spread across half of the world have the same culture then you are sadly mistaken, my friend. The predicament as I stated earlier with most of the Americans is that sitting in US and getting whatever biased information from their local news network, they think that they know the world rightly. Please understand that the world out there is very different from what it is made out to be. Unless an average simple and good at heart American is not made scared of the big bad world out there, how can the US War Machinery and Corporations make billions of money from war hysteria. This goes all the way to Washington. I guess I have said enough. If you do n't believe, please come to any Muslim country especially the oil rich Kingdoms and see for yourself, what beautiful lives and lucrative jobs the Westerners especially the Americans enjoy. And yes there are churches, temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli jews are also very few by choice). In history we have had such phobias against the Indigenous Americans( earlier known as Red Indians), then Blacks and now the Muslims. <h> Occam 's Tool 1.7.11 @ 7:02PM <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 3:36AM <p> Dear Occam, <p> Honestly I do n't know of any predominantly Muslim country having a sizable Jewish population. <p> But then the reason is not that much maltreatment or victimization as it is economics. <p> There is no denying the fact that US and Israel are much more economically prosperous countries than Muslim dominated countries in the Middle East. US is the land of opportunities not only for Jewish people but also for Hindus, Buddhist, Muslims and other people of the world. Most of the people if given a chance would want to migrate there solely for better economic prospects. <p> Hence the natural trend of Jews would also be to move to US and even to their promised land of Israel which by the way is also mentioned in Judaism. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US are economic but to get the gullible West 's sympathies the reasons for migration are projected as religious intolerance in Muslims countries. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 12:10PM <h> Sweeney 1.7.11 @ 2:40PM <p> Musl did get it right. His( or her) thinking that our opinions are based on " biased news coverage of remote incidents " is absolutely spot-on. However, I would describe media coverage favors Muslims due to the fact that their reports are infrequent and downplayed enough so as to go unnoticed. <p> The rest of that comment is so riddled with lies that this person can be no less than criminally insane. <h> Schulze 1.7.11 @ 2:17PM <p> Of course this incident is directly related to colonialism. Colonialism has bled all of the third world dry and forced it 's own views of " civilization " upon it. As a result, people hunger, people are uneducated and, following this, people are prone to become extremists. The USA, too, has it 's fair share in all this sad kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nineties in nearby Afghanistan to push out the soviets, and Saudi Arabia, a kingdom with no constitution, is still one big buddy of U.S. administration. Of course, this is a scandal. But it is no less scandalous to declare these people the satan of modern world. Once it were blacks, than jews, now muslims? Most of the 1,6 BILLION muslims in the world never did anything wrong. You must understand that ALL religions harbour extremists. There are a few in islam, there are a few extremist jews, and there sure as hell are a few extremist christians. Just look around in your own fine dump of a country! <h> Musl Pak 1.7.11 @ 2:44PM <p> I fully agree with you Schulze. <p> It is our job as the moderate believers of the same God to rise above the petty differences created in the name of our religions and finish off the extremism and hate prevalent among the vocal few in our societies. <p> Muslim moderates are on the back foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, are my Christian moderates doing the same in their backyard? Seeing from the e-mail exchanges on this forum, it seems a challenge over there too. <h> idalily 1.7.11 @ 3:10PM <p> Musl, you 'll have to give Americans some time here. People of your religion murdered 3,000 innocent members of our citizenry on our own soul only ten years ago. I saw and heard very little sympathy from moderate Muslims at the time. If you were there, you were pretty quiet. We may need to " rise above the petty differences " but many of your fellow Muslims have much bigger things to rise above. Murdering Americans in an unprovoked attack, for example. And I do n't hear hatred of Muslims preached at my local church, but I can safely say they are at the local mosque. When it comes to pointing fingers of blame, please start a little closer to your own backyard. <h> Musl 1.7.11 @ 3:36PM <p> Please do accept my heartfelt condolences again on the sad and untimely demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and nationalities. It was indeed a horrendous attack on humanity that day not just on US. People from around the world died. Let me assure you that Muslims around the world shuddered from this event and were indeed saddened but regret to say that they did not get projected on western media. Only a few, barely in hundreds in a population of more than 1.6 Bio aired their happiness to get media attention. And you might not believe me, but some of the jubilation shots specially in West Bank were not even shot on that day. These were shots taken from some earlier jubilant event. You might think I 'm lying but I know since I was based in an Arab country then. And yes you are right we have a few fanatics teaching hate in the name of religion but so are many in Christian churches and the best answer for all such fanatics irrespective of their religion is to admonish or just ignore them. They are mad men from around the world. Regards <h> Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... we have a few fanatics teaching hate... " is disingenuous at best. <p> When you make a statement such as that, everyone knows what you are doing. You are attempting to force a stalemate so the debate will end but is very insulting to the people who seriously think about this topic. <h> Musl 1.7.11 @ 4:29PM <p> Sorry to hurt your feeling Bob. <p> I agreed that there are fanatics and I also gave a solution of how to deal with them. <p> What is your suggested solution. <p> Remember, its easy to kill a person but very difficult to kill his cause that gets transferred to others. This is how violence only spreads more violence and all become terrorist. Its just that some wear a Uniform and others wear a Turban. <h> Musl 1.7.11 @ 5:00PM <p> Bob I wanted to disengage but am compelled to respond to you. <p> My American boss once told me, " I see no difference between O Bin Laden and Bush Jr. Both of them claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that they are fighting for God and both of them are killing innocent civilians( as collateral damage) in their righteous war against the other( presumed infidel/non believers) ". <p> Its just that one has been termed a Moslem while the other President of United States. So my friend like I 've been saying two wrongs are not making a right and both sides are unjustified in their actions. And who is getting killed in the end the innocent Americans, Afghans, Paks and others in the cross fire. <p> We have to give peace and reasoning a chance. Violence will not get us anywhere. Can we please agree on this? <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 3:48AM <p> Dear Mathew, <p> Thanks a lot for your kind words. Indeed appreciated. <p> You are right in saying that the sane voices which finally reach you are far and few and the simple reason is the lack of common forums. Take this for example, I guess of the tens of opinions aired here only three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even aware of these many discussion forums in the West. <p> Secondly most of the moderate muslims I know avoid getting into such discussions on fear of being branded as extremists, fanatics or apologists by their Western counterparts. The fear of getting tracked down by the vigilant government agencies also persist hence internet silence is preferred. <p> Lastly religion is a very personal matter for all of us and after a while I see people irrespective of their beliefs loosing their composure and stooping to irrational, nonsensical and at times inflammatory teasing which is not helpful towards promoting logical discussion. <p> But I guess we have to rise above such challenges for the common good of homo sapiens because we are humans first and Christians, Muslims, Jews later. <h> Musl 1.7.11 @ 3:44PM <p> Richard, Are you telling me there are no killings in America on disagreement? Its just that Muslims tend to hide their heinous act behind Islam. Despicable indeed. Let me explain ; Malays, Indonesians, Kazakhs, Bosnians etc are also Muslims, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion since its not there in their culture. However, some Arabs or South Asians do it unfortunately since its part of their culture. Religion is yet again a tool abused to justify their crime. It might have had worked earlier but does n't work anymore. So again, mate, its culture of those lands not Islam. <h> Ken( Old Texican) 1.7.11 @ 3:50PM <p> Richard, save your breath. Musl is trapped in outer darkness. There is an Arabic term... Takania?( sic) that literally translated means " holy lies " to be told to infidels, uh us. Somehow, these poor lost souls think that God needs slaves... or wants slaves..... duh! <p> The Bible teaches that God created mankind in fellowship with Him. These poor souls picture our Creator as some sort of overgrown Saudi King... but with no morals whatsoever... just a slave driver for His personal amusement. <h> martin j smith 1.7.11 @ 3:57PM <p> I smell the smell of geoprge Soros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fred Flinstone name a few. When you have posts who give you their sarcastic insulting attitude I think you can bet they are operatives not those who have serious facts. Let me give an example : Would a Jew who is Orthodox be welcome in Saudi Arabia and be allowed to pray in a Temple of Jewish prayer un hindered? In fact would a Jew be permitted to fly saw from Tel Aviv to Ryad? there is a lot of talk about so called Islamophobia in the US. But I contend that here is more phobia of the West in Muslim countries than the other way around. However when a group of Muslims come here and flip the bird to the American people of the Ground Zero mosqu ethat Is Islamophobia. Those Muslims who are leaders of the Muslim community in this case arrogantly deny traitions, sentiment and the emotions connected to the area and persist in flipping the bird so to speak. Well in this particular case those leaders--not all Muslims--are seen in a very negative light indeed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated with respect it goes both ways, not one way. Treat those who practice other religions in your country with respect and it will be reciprocated. treat the culture and traditions of your new home country appropriately and you will be given respect. There have been too many incidents where this has not happened. The ground zero mosque is but one example. <h> Occam 's Tool 1.7.11 @ 7:04PM <p> Please, a predominantly Muslim country where there is a robust and prosperous Jewish minority that builds new synagogues. The answer is that there are few Jews in Muslim countries, and not " by choice, " BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO FREEDOM THERE. <h> WeMustResist 1.8.11 @ 8:08AM <p> Yes there are good and bad people in every religion, but not all religions have bad doctrines. A religion that believes God to be full of hate and lies has two bad doctrines. Yes religion is a very personal matter and we can not tell a mans religious beliefs by a label, only by his words and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religion of Mohammed( who started the religion) is not relaxed. Yes there are fanatics all around the world but the best way to deal with them is to resist them. They must never be allowed to think they are right. They are wrong. We should contest them as often as we reasonably can. I see you are trying hard to be fair Musl and I wish you good luck. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 12:21PM <p> Thank you mate. <p> I 'm just trying to follow the real religion of Muhammed. Religion of peace, compassion and tolerance and indeed resisting the fanatics in my backyard, who have distorted this religion to gain their own political objectives. Your good luck is truly valued. I 'm sure you are also resisting your own fanatics present in your home turf promoting hatred and war. <h> Louis Jenkins 1.8.11 @ 3:47PM <p> From the WRS blog a small snippet : <p> " All this is increasingly obvious, particularly to those not brain-altered in institutions of higher learning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public has a chance to express itself on related issues such as immigration, bilingual education, gayization or dhimmization, the people overwhelmingly reject the diversity project. The ruling elite continues implementing it nonetheless by a series of increasingly totalitarian measures, including judicial nullification of inconvenient plebiscites, new laws explicitly at odds with the will of the people, persecution of " crimes of intolerance, " and executive rulings that circumvent the apparatus of democracy. " <p> Our law makers simply do not care. And they have mouth pieces who speak for them. <h> A.C.Guard 1.7.11 @ 4:30PM <p> These crazies are in the UK now and out birthing British citizens, Within 25 years the UK will be an Islamic country with sharia law. It will happen here too if we allow it. As a start do not elect far left liberals and somehow get us away from Political Correctness which insures radical Muslims( is that an oxymoron) will take over our country. <h> Tim the Enchanter 1.7.11 @ 4:59PM <h> Ed 1.7.11 @ 5:04PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and a hard core libertarian, I agree. Get out and get out now. Leave these people alone to kill each other. If the Taliban and Al Quaida come back, blast them with drones and the heck with civilian casualties <h> Norman Conquest 1.7.11 @ 6:33PM <p> How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. <p> The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. <p> A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement ; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. <p> No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step ; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 4:36AM <p> Miss Boss, <p> I 've read your highly charged point of views and all I see in them is an anguished and perplexed soul looking for redemption. God Help you in that. <p> About your advise to me about History books, I feel that they are not more than story books written by authors to propagate their points of view over the naive readers. There are enough history books written on atrocities, killings and even genocide committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews around WWII Germany 2. Catholics over Protestants 3. Catholics over Orthodox Christians 4. White christian settlers over indigenous Americans 5. Christian Europeans over African Slaves 6. Christians over Christians( US Civil War, Word Wars etc) The list goes on..... <p> Now does this make Christianity or all Christians bad? No! Same is the case with Islam and Muslims. Have a heart and please learn to differentiate between criminals and their religions. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 12:24PM <h> missbosslady 1.8.11 @ 1:39PM <p> You have made many statements, putting them forth as fact, subsequently claiming your entitled to your opinion. Indeed you are entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts. <p> Your disingenuousness does not go unnoticed. If one goes back and reviews your comments they will find a false humility preceeding a backhanding in most instances. <p> Your claim that your posts are not meant to convince are the most dishonest. Clearly, in several posts you are trying to convince the reader, is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying to deceive the dhimmi? One can not help but wonder. Of course, what really stands out, to me in particular, is your lack of response to my posts concerning women and Islam. Frankly, I understand why you would n't, but very telling indeed. <p> As far as having a good life, I 'm a free woman in a free country, so a good life I do have and as you and I both know, if I lived in a muslim country that certainly would not be the case. <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 3:48PM <p> Miss Boss, <p> At least we can agree to disagree? Thats a start. <p> Women in Islamic countries live normal, progressive and secure lives. They enjoy equal opportunities and are entitled to education. They make good doctors, lawyers, engineers, pilots, business executives, bankers, scientists, nurses, educationists, actresses and what not. Yes some unfortunate incidents of violence and injustice do prevail but they are as common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Unfortunately the ones occurring here are duly reported on international media thus spreading an overall twisted image of that Muslim country and Islam. <p> Having said that, women across the world have to be generally careful from aggressive, violent and mentally deranged psychopathic men and thats not limited to just Muslim countries only. <p> Following is an excerpt I wish to share with you from an valid source on Women 's position in Islam. <p> Quote " A woman was in a miserable state before Islam. She was subject to humiliation, injustice and oppression. She was buried alive for fear of poverty. Also, because women were used as a means for gaining money and for prostitution, which is a source of disgrace. By the advent of Islam Shari'a honors the woman, gives her natural position in life and returns her freedom. In general, she is like a man except in some rulings and regulations that befit her physiologically. The woman in Islam ranks high as a daughter, sister, wife and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as independence to behave within the Shari'a limits and good customs that Islam sanctions, i.e. without committing what is Haram such as displaying her charm, misdeeds and uncovering her body. At the same time, man has freedom, but within Shari'a limitations and good and useful customs that Islam sanctions. So, it is not true to say that women do not rank high in Islam. Whoever wants Muslim women to be free from her modesty, morals, honor and religion wants misery for her, to overburden her and to ask her to do what she naturally can not " Unquote. <p> For better understanding women 's position in Islam you can go to Google and type the words ' Women in Islam ' and you 'll get various legit sites. I wanted to forward you some but am unable to do so. <p> Since you have sworn never to set foot in a muslim country maybe these sites will help you better understand in general women 's position in Islamic countries. Otherwise come and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end, I 'm not trying to convince you but just trying to show you the other side of the picture. Inconvenience is regretted. <h> Bob Grant 1.8.11 @ 10:52AM 1.8.11 @ 12:30PM <p> No Bob, I 've said it before and I 'll say it again. Jews were victims of Nazi Holocaust. I 've been to one of the concentration camps in Dachau, Germany and seen the horrible place myself. Infact there was one muslim lady Dr. Mehrun Nissa who was also burnt in one of the human ovens and her body fat used in soap by the Nazis. So I can fully sympathize with Jews on Holocaust. <h> darcy 1.10.11 @ 2:33AM <p> Quite so, missbosslady. Martin Luther wrote " On War Against the Turks "( ca1528) ; makes for very interesting reading that is even more harsh on Islam than is Churchill. I recommend it. <p> We must never, ever forget that taqiyya is a mark of virtue for Muslims which permits them to lie through their teeth to " infidels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust none of them. <p> Whereas, to Christians, lying is a sin, and is roundly denounced from the pulpit and among Christians themselves. <h> Chris 1.7.11 @ 6:58PM <p> Islam is a religion founded by a murderous madman for murderous madmen. When Muslims blow people up they are just following in the Muhammad 's bloody footsteps. There is no such thing as ' moderate ' Islam. Islam is and always was a barbaric death cult masquerading as a religion. If satan devised his own religion, it would be indistinguishable from the religion of Muhammad( MHRIH). <h> George True 1.7.11 @ 8:19PM <h> John II 1.8.11 @ 12:51AM <p> It was n't " Allah " who communicated the Qur'an to Mohammed. It was an angel. And the angel was n't Gabriel. <p> When you think about it, though, the " Allah " of Islam appears to be a self-appointed god of utterly arbitrary Will, including most prominently the will to destroy. Not exactly the God of Abraham, Isaac, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one called Lucifer. <h> Jack 1.8.11 @ 12:00AM <p> Speaking of people giving in to irrational fears and delusions! You can look to the Global Warming extremists to see that same kind of unfounded hysteria in the so called civilized world. The planet is getting older but as a civilization we are not getting any wiser just more techie. <h> Big J 1.8.11 @ 7:49AM <p> I 'm not sure if it 's been said yet, but I feel an important point needs to be made. <p> Islam is not so much a religion as it is a political movement with a religious aspect to it( simply cover for the truly powerful members to ultimately rule the world). <p> As long as it is classified as a religion, human nature being what it is, Islam will be tolerated. Pretty neat trick if you ask me. <p> The three basic tenets include conversion, taxation, then destruction. That may be over simplified, but that 's Islam in a nutshell. <p> Over yonder, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it 's been for a hell of a lot longer than we 've been around, and nothing 's gon na change that, baby. <p> Maybe the majority of the turban-wearers want what we 've got, but if so, they have to rise up on their own. After all, we had to be pushed to our limits before taking on the most powerful military on the planet, tossing their tea in the harbor. The fact that we did it on our own makes our freedom and our way of life so much more valuable. <p> I thought for a moment that the Iranians were going to make the leap. From what I understand, the majority of them are modernized, and want to emulate the West. Unfortunately our Manchurian in Chief could n't take a few minutes off the links to give them a shout-out. Sadly, I feel this is one of the biggest missed opportunities of this administration. Many times a little encouragement is all it takes to give the little guy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Middle Eastern policy( if you can call it that) has been an abject failure for a lot longer than I have been around. For some unknown reason, " peace in the Middle East " has been the Holy Grail, the Brass Ring of administration after administration - for over HALF A CENTURY! Enough already. I ca n't imagine Hillary has a better reset button than the Peanut Farmer did - it has got to stop! <p> Again, at the risk of over-simplifying, here are the only answers, as far as I 'm concerned : <p> 1. Pull out. I mean every last one of them. Bring our men and women home. Hell, we 're not letting them fight anyway, and the 800 pound gorilla says we 'll never win, no matter what we do. <p> 2. No more money. I mean not one red cent, to no one, no how. One thing we should know by now is that the crooks and Mullahs are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region is still oppressed( I defer you to the half a century comment above). <p> 3. The Chicago Way. They bring a knife, you bring a gun. They put one of yours in the hospital, you send one of theirs to the morgue. Now that 's change you can believe in. Within 24 hours of finding out who perpetrated the horror of 9/11 and where he was, we should have turned those mountains to glass. " Sorry ya 'll, but I was cleaning it and it went off! ". Brute force is the only thing these nut jobs understand. Just look at how they live, whipped into submission over the fear of being stoned to death? A light weight nuke would probably keep Achmadena-whatever 's mouth shut for years to come. <p> * Pardon the length of this rant, but someone 's got ta say it. <p> One last thing : <p> I met #43 back in 2008, shook his hand. It was the experience of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 minute speech by the man( no teleprompter, no notes). It turns out he is not the ignorant boob that the Left would have you believe. The man is extremely intelligent, and a serious history buff. <p> I saw and understood his " Middle Eastern Policy "( I guess you might call it the Bush Doctrine during a vice presidential debate or something). Unfortunately, he was viewing the region through rose colored glasses. <p> You could take out 15 dictators in that region and try to force feed democracy to 15 fledgling countries, and it just would n't work. They did n't earn it, you see. It does n't mean squat to them. Give it a few years, and you have a new, bigger, badder MoFo running the show, sending his good little Muslims over here to blow us up. <p> I have a lot more to say on the subject, but this is turning into one seriously long a$$ rant, so I 'll defer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan! 1.8.11 @ 7:59AM <h> Eric Millage 1.8.11 @ 8:12AM <p> Wow Tucker, you really kicked off quite a hearty debate! I think this type of open dialogue is quite healthy. I found many comments vert insightful. One thing which is obvious however is our need to be able to present our points of views without personally attacking one another. I think we are all better listeners when we keep our discourse civil. <h> Who Knows? 1.8.11 @ 11:51AM <p> Ten years or so ago, I happened to be where libraries received too many books to sell, so there was always a place with interesting free ones, which I regularly perused in order to cull those that I liked. These days the situation is vastly different. <p> Still, yesterday I marched to the local library, read the regular papers, and completed the biography of Ikkyu, who died in 1481. What a blast from the past! The tiny room that sells old library books sucked me in, for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and there it was---maybe ten or so FREE books. <p> Carefully I checked them out, and almost the last one grabbed my present attention, mightily--- " Breaking Ranks " by Norman Podhoretz, from 1979! Since these days, and for some ten years previously, or so, I 've been enjoying so much edifying content on the Internet, one of the sites that stands out is the " Contentions " part of Commentary Magazine, and this is where, of course, Mr. Podhoretz made his name. <p> Well, this book from almost THIRTY years ago is a political memoir that started out as a letter to explain to his still-young son, John, how he evolved into a " Neoconservative ". <p> What a trip down my own memory lane! So many of the radical authors who became my " mentors " seem to have been directly involved with, if not discovered and promulgated by, good old Norm! There 's Norman Brown and Paul Goodman, just for starters. I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to about 1960. <p> Then, today, as I read my normal sparse Internet stuff, there he was---P.J. O'Rourke, with his latest witty take on it all. <p> Ah, age and aging does have its benefits and privileges. To get to receive the wisdom from those two OLD radicals, P.J. and Norman, why all I can say is---WOW! <p> In the weird science category, it is claimed that some sensitive people can simply handle very old fragments---say an Indian arrowhead---and thus experience the whole ancient scene surrounding it. <p> Something like this is happening for moi, as I ca n't help but freely allow the timely connections in my own life to arise. That is, keeping many plates in the air, for example, I can " be " in 1979 as Norman writes this book, myself, and whatever year he 's remembering---if I was alive then, that is. I can even conjure the milieu, generally, of those years when I was n't personally alive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Heart to be felt, which brings me to today 's many centuries of consideration 's conclusion. <p> In Ikkyu 's time, Japan suffered horribly through a civil war that devastated property and killed many thousands, causing rampant starvation and suffering. So, let 's keep in mind those days when the " political " divide was absolute, with the actual physical fight for power so widespread, along with the entire span of time that Norman Podhoretz has lived. And, what about right now? <p> It sure seems to me that the real chickens ARE coming home to not only roost, but to embody America 's very being. That is, what is the very nature of the complete body politic in this country, presently? <p> Absolute partisan divide! <p> And, just imagine the nature of all the disparate individuals who are locked into their own political " take "! <p> The scariest one for me---me, as a youth, so nave and also certain about it all, myself! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate the ongoing battle between the Dems and their bitter opponents, especially at the federal level, how is it possible to do other than tremble in fear---be afraid, very afraid---about the scary prospect that so many fooled and foolish voters are happily, even if in a totally deluded manner, cruising for a suicidal bruising, as they are about to blindly vote for the jackass party. <p> I, personally, with my long life of wide experience, just find it impossible to believe that an Obama or a Hillary could ever get elected president. Surely the majority of the voters ca n't be that stupid---and, YET! Remember the hissy fit they had in 1976, when Dhimmi Carter conned most of us, including me, into office--- and this was right in the middle of the Cold War! <p> Somebody recently excused the way the West has been reacting to the Radical Muslim threat, by saying we can afford to be stupid, because we are so strong. Well, just try to look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto-proof and filibuster-proof Congress, with suicidal laws and judge nominations! <p> Perhaps THAT will be our own version of a " civil war " similar to what Japan chose in the 1400 's, and the shock will be enough to bring America Alone onto a required war footing. I continue to believe that some kind of massive horrible atrocity must shock us, to wake us up. The current trend is NOT our friend! <p> Finally, we could try to deconstruct the basic " mood " of the polled electorate. Something like 80% of our citizens believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. They are RIGHT! But what are the internals? <p> Here 's my take. It 's eerily similar to the late 1930 's, in England. That is, about 50% are buying the weak " appeasement " policy of the Dumocrats, and perhaps 30% have their informed and wise heads on straight, with the remaining 20% absolutely out of touch with reality that does n't extend beyond their own egoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let this misguided majority opinion take power, and then---BAM! A terrible inflection point ensues, to wildly shift sentiment, so that a complete turnaround occurs. I just wonder if this can possibly happen BEFORE the November elections, or really, whether we definitely must take the wrong path, once more, and tempt our existential fate. <p> Ah, another old memory just arose. Probably fifty years ago there was a famous cigarette ad, whose slogan was, " I 'd rather fight than switch ", with the speaker brandishing a black eye while smoking their favorite brand. Well, these appeasing days, it seems like the majority of Americans stupidly are ready and willing to switch, not fight! <h> Musl 1.8.11 @ 1:25PM <p> I 'm glad to share with you the following edict given out by ' Shaykh-ul-Islam Hazrat Mufti Muhammad Idris Usmani ' of Jamia Islamia who is roughly equivalent to a ' Senior Cardinal ' in the ' Vatican '. <p> He has issued the following ' fatwa '( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about those who are praising and justifying his murder. <p> Quote " Question : <p> What do the Ulema say about the murder of Governor of Punjab( Pakistan) Salman Taseer who was killed by his own security guard. The guard claimed that he killed Salman Taseer because he was blasphemous to the Prophet( peace by upon him). However, there is no evidence of Salman Taseer 's blasphemy to the Prophet( pbuh). What do the Ulema say about many people who are praising Salman Taseer 's killer? <p> Answer : <p> " In the Name of the Merciful and Compassionate Allah, Dar al-Fatwa. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe ; blessings and peace be upon our Master Muhammad, the Apostle of Allah, <p> I have carefully read the whole issue and also read various news reports and articles related to this( issue). I have also spoken to the ' jayyad ulema '( eminent scholars) in Pakistan and India. <p> In the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Malik Mumtaz Qadri has committed ' gunah-e-azeem '( great sin) by killing an innocent soul. By taking law into his own hand, by killing an innocent man, and by bringing disgrace to the name of Islam, Malik Mumtaz Qadri has created ' fasad fil arz '( mischief on earth) and committed ' tauheen-e-risalat '( blasphemy to the Prophet). Same applies to those who are creating further mischief( fasad) by praising or justifying this heinous crime in the name of Islam. The killer of Salman Taseer is a real blasphemer to Islam and the holy Prophet( peace be upon him). <p> 2. Those individuals and groups including the ignorant ulema, misguided journalists, politicians, lawyers ' wa deegar '( etc), who are celebrating or justifying in any manner this heinous crime must be treated as accomplice in this crime. Those who endorsed a fatwa of Salman Taseer 's murder too must be treated as ' mufsid fil arz '( mischief mongers) and must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Pakistan will pursue a legal case against the killer and his abettors according to their national laws, the following verses from the Quran clearly specify the punishment for Malik Mumtaz Qadri and his supporters and cheerers. " Unquote <p> So you see guys, Islam does not preach violence but it 's some of the followers who use it to justify their actions. <p> I have learned a allot in the last one day from our debate and hope you have understood the other perspective as well. <h> Big J 1.8.11 @ 7:23PM <p> Sorry, I just ca n't stand it any more. <p> Let 's parse : <p> You know, you 're rhetoric reminds me of an Iranian immigrant I met during the Thanksgiving holiday. He was well educated( in an American university, paid for with partial government grants), worked for a large American firm for a generous salary, and had enjoyed the freedoms that this wonderful country affords all who reside here( legally or otherwise). It took about 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thou monster actually showed his true colors, but when it happened, he did n't hold back. <p> You see, our Mohamed( his real name) believes that America has been responsible for the destruction of more civilization and the death of more innocent people here and around the world than any other nation in history. He believes that Americans are greedy capitalists, hell bent on conquering the world, occupying every country, imposing democracy and EVIL capitalism on each country we destroy, after killing as many innocent civilians as possible - I think you get my point. <p> While Mohamed dips his beak in the sweet glass that is liberty, he chooses to completely trash the source of that nourishment. <p> I could deal with about 15 minutes of his tirade( he was very calm about it), and had to leave. I had tears of rage in my eyes as I was driving home. To think that someone could benefit so much from this wonderful nation, yet continually stab it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew people like Mohamed existed, I just have never been so close to one. <p> Thank God he went back to Liberal Oregon, where I am certain he is surrounded with like-minded idiots. That stuff do n't fly down here in Texas my friend. <p> So here we have Musl( short for Muslim, I 'm sure, but not sure why). Musl would have us believe that Islam is just like Christianity. In fact, according to Musl, Christians have been much more violent and oppressive, much less tolerant than any religion that has ever existed. Laughable at first, but I am starting to wonder if he really believes that, and expects us to agree? <p> We are to believe that the genital mutilation of women, the stonings, the be-headings, the use of children as suicide bombers, the fatwa 's, jihad, etc, etc, etc are just a few radical extremists, not the mainstream? <p> HOGWASH( heavy on the hog). <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince any sensible person that Islam is a peaceful religion, and we should all just get along. <p> No, George Bush is not the moral equivalent to Osama bin Laden. Sorry, go sell crazy somewhere else, we 're all filled up here. <p> No, Christians have not oppressed, maimed, nor killed the innocents that the " handful of radicals " located in your peaceful religion have oppressed, maimed and killed. <p> And please do n't insult our intelligence regarding the abundant access to education that your women have. They are forbidden to go to school in a lot of Muslim countries, and you know it. Not to mention the fact that they are n't even allowed to pray next to the men, nor walk next to them( 10 steps behind - I 've seen it hundreds of times), nor ride in the front seat of the car with the men. Nor are they allowed to simply LOOK at a man outside of the immediate family( an offense punishable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, do n't pee on my leg and tell me it 's raining! <p> Missbosslady had it right. America 's where it 's at. You are more than welcome to participate in the religion of your choice, make as much of your life as you want, and according to a growing number of activist judges, apply sharia law in your household as you see fit. <p> I ca n't for the life of me figure out why that is n't enough for you - of course, enough is never enough. For some reason, you need to convince a bunch of uneducated and bigoted American Spectator readers that your way is not only good, but it is the right way. If we would just give Islam a chance, we would see. <p> Well, I say take your twisted so-called religion back to the desert where it belongs. We do n't want it or need it. Or do n't - whatever. As was said above : quit peddling your pig dung here. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to change that. <p> Now if you 'll excuse me, I am going to go open the truck door for my beautiful wife( the front one), and take her out to show off how beautiful she is( leave the burkha in the closet, baby!). She 'll stand side by side with me, free as a bird! <h> Musl 1.10.11 @ 3:25AM <p> Big J, Just when I thought I 'll conclude, I find myself sucked back into this forum but hopefully for the last time. My response may be long but I had to answer your misperceptions. Your story about the Iranian immigrant is indeed sad. But the person is entitled to his view, something that many liberal Americans of all other religions may also have, rightly or wrongly is another debate. My question is, what has your Mohammed 's religion got to do with this. For this one Muslim you 've told me, I can tell stories of several other Muslims who love America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died for America. So once again religion is not the cause of your Mohammed 's views. Maybe his country of origin is Iran - did you ever think about that? <p> About your accusation of me projecting Christianity as more violent than Islam. You are wrong my friend. I 've been saying repeatedly that Muslims and Christians have been violent in time and have justified their actions through their religions ; whereas their religions do not teach violence. I in fact take Christianity and Islam at par. Period. <p> Islam does not promote ' Genital mutilations '. My God! That 's the most abhor-able thing in Islam. It used to be done by very few conservatives in Egypt out of their culture. Its all but finished now. <p> Your quote, " Kids turned into suicide bombers ". My Answer : Again this is a detestable act done by the criminals and not supported in Islam at all. <p> Stoning to death on adultery is again a controversial issue which is not in Koran at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days for murderers since they did not have firing squads, electric execution chairs or lethal injections( which are there in your country for capital punishment) and beheading was the least painful of all deaths only for confirmed serial murderers and rapists. <p> About your comments on women in Islam, Quote " They are forbidden to go to school in a lot of Muslim countries, and you know it " My answer : You are WRONG!!! Name one muslim country where the state does not allow woman education and support your response it with legit records. If some very few " Mormon " types in Muslim region refuse to evolve with time, you cant blame it on their religion or state. <p> Quote, " Not to mention the fact that they are n't even allowed to pray next to the men ". My Ans : Yes thats correct and there was a reason for that which you might not even understand. There is nothing wrong in giving them the liberty to pray separately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quote, " nor walk next to them( 10 steps behind - I 've seen it hundreds of times), nor ride in the front seat of the car with the men " Unquote. My Ans : What times are you referring to? Is this the same time when you were doing the same with Afro Americans in your country? When they were not allowed to study with you, travel with you, eat with you and what not( ' cause this is what I 've seen from your media before 70 's). Again this is not there anymore and religion anyway has nothing to do with that. Again it was Arab culture. <p> Quote, " Nor are they allowed to simply LOOK at a man outside of the immediate family( an offense punishable by stoning or flogging) ". Ans : Now this is complete Hogwash with a capital ' HOG '. Put your fact straight ' J '. THIS IS NOT CORRECT AT ALL. <p> In my discussions here I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great country with majority of people as good, easy going and moderate as the ones living in Muslim countries. Its some of the misguided souls such as you, there who I 'm trying to address. These hate mongers are no different from the ones we have. Who I also try to reason with and get the same crap back that i got from you. Emotional and illogical based on half baked truth. One of them is the ' burkha '. Islam does not advise this garb, its the Arab culture! <p> Wish you all the very best with your lovely wife. I 'm sure you love her and when you mean " show off how beautiful she is " you do n't mean " flaunt her as your trophy " ; cause it might hurt her sensitivities. I believe you respect her as a person and as your life partner, just like all wives around the world are meant to be for their husbands, irrespective of their religions, cultures or countries. <h> Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.10.11 @ 8:16AM <p> I did n't post the above offensive comments. Some misguided muslim probably did in order to trigger a negative reaction from overly sensitive readers who do n't always follow the peaceful surats of the Holy Quran. Does this kind of bs cop out sound familiar? I thought so. Now keep watching YOUR mirror and buzz off. <h> Jeremiah 1.10.11 @ 8:55AM <h> gary siebel 1.8.11 @ 2:31PM <p> But they are not just on the other side of the world.

They ca n't admit to their own mistakes and have an extreme delusions of grandeur. Add to that their sense of entitlement when it comes to the welfare systems and we are almost done with a full analysis. And should we be surprised when the so called prophet displayed all the traits of a narcissist and when his virtues became the norm of every pious muslim the result is a cult of narcissism with a billion potential victims. <h> Ferris 1.8.11 @ 5:08PM <p> Political correctness need to Die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who want to do US harm, and we have allowed them in and continue to allow them to live among us and plotting to convert OR Kill US!! I do n't know what could possibly be politically correct about that???

The entire history of Islam since the 7th century confirms the above. It behoves our government to act on these uncontestable truths and suppress all adherents of this detestable and murderous political program. " Islam is a religion of peace " is a cruel joke and should be prosecuted as treasonous. <h> Shawn 1.8.11 @ 6:36PM <p> That 's because they are savages following a barbaric religion that has refused to evolve over more than an eon.

This is a policy the leaders of the " religion of peace " may understand. <h> Yephora 1.8.11 @ 7:52PM <h> benadam 1.9.11 @ 2:57AM <p> How can we offer protection for those being perseuted, when already inside out so-called ' christina( sic) ' ntions there are sharia courts, mosques, and politicians bending over to the spread and radicilisation of violent islam.

As if. <p> As if, you could convince us that the mass protesting, and multiple attempted murders over a cartoon are within the realm of decency, reason and sanity. As if. <p> As if, you could explain why the potential killing, by the Pakistani government, of a Christian mother of five is not met with widespread condemnation and similar protests by the muslim world.

If somebody says that a particular verse in Quran orders killing of someone, please try to see the context in which it was revealed. Try to understand the full ' Para '.

Have you ever tried to find out that even after trying to promote peace, which nation exports highest number of ammunition to the world, to kill each other... Before you spend time figuring that out, let me help you. That is United States that exports weapons worth of USD 170 billion( official figures, unofficial is definitely higher), and 60% of these arms are sold to Developing countries. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " the other side of the world.

This was extremely insulting to their clients, as even the most benighted person must understand and, he was relieved when he no longer had to introduce her to them. <p> The mother and sister of a young Nigerian woman who worked for my wife were murdered, apparently by the father and husband because they refused to return to Nigeria so the daughter could be entered into a forced marriage. My wife 's colleague has since gone underground, leaving her job in the auto industry here. The father has returned to Nigeria and has never been apprehended. <p> My other son broke his friendship with another Nigerian Muslim when he refused to eat at our house telling my son, quite frankly our table was " unclean " even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly accommodated Muslim dietary strictures( I myself have had Muslim clients, as well as Hindus and Buddhists and was always conscientious of their needs. My Hindu and Buddhist friends have dined with me and my wife). <p> The mainstream press downplays these events but ; these are true accounts from my own experience. We have the largest Middle Eastern population outside of the Middle East between Detroit and Toledo and, while the vast majority of them are good people and good citizens( my own doctor and tailor are both Arabs ; I do n't ' know nor care about my doctor 's religion-my tailor is a Muslim) but, there is a small but growing element within the Muslim sector which has adopted either a hard or " soft " approach to jihad, honor killings-as in the case of my wife 's colleague 's family and other evil aspects of Islam. We tolerate all races, creeds and colors-as we should and must according to American principles but, we must not tolerate this evil in our midst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Asif Abbasi 1.10.11 @ 12:12AM <p> Lets decipher each of the above events : <p>( 1) An itern did n't want to shake hands with men she did n't know? How is that wrong or unethical? Last time i checked, US was the biggest supporter of free will. Why can n't simply a hello suffice? IMHO, you would be the one forcing someone to shake hands, because you think that is good your clientele. <p>( 2) In the second story of murder, you yourself have used the world apparently. Again trying to link a murder or an act of an individual person with the religion. That is same as if i try to link *john wayne gacy* the biggest Rapist of all time, with Christian religion, and try to prove that it was religion that made him do so. http : **33;5127;TOOLONG... <h> Musl 1.10.11 @ 3:46AM <p> I commend you for being steadfast in face of so much hate and animosity thrown at you. <p> But sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world try to explain to the other side the real essence of Islam, the closed minds over there would just not understand. <p> All the very best and to all the moderates and rational Muslim and Non-muslim friends out there too. I 'm sure one day we will prevail over hate, lies and mischief all over this one world we have, making it a better place to live for all. Amen. <h> Tom in Michigan 1.10.11 @ 1:59PM <h> John Navratil 1.10.11 @ 10:58AM <p> Asif Abbasi, <p> An intern has the absolute right to refuse to shake hands with anyone. And the employer has the absolute right to terminate an employee who hurts his business by being culturally insensitive to his clients. <h> Tom in Michigan 1.10.11 @ 1:57PM <p> Your arguments and " decipher " are not only specious, they attempt to justify the murder of two innocent women who came here seeking freedom but died, nevertheless. <p> Who said those whose hands the intern refused to shake were all men? The case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman. The intern refused to shake any non-Muslims ' hands. <p> When I interact with say, Japanese clients here ; I do not bow because it is not expected or proper. However, when I am in Japan ; I bow in the appropriate fashion for a Westerner in Japan. I 've learned and accept their customs. <p> As for the two womens ' murderer ; the father and husband was the prime suspect and is still being sought. He had threatened them openly regarding the daughter 's refusal to be forced into marriage - which is why they fled Detroit for New York. <p> You are a perfect example of Muslim apologists for any act in the " name of Islam, " no matter how heinous and, represent the very reasons so many people have adopted a negative attitude towards your ilk. <p> Finally, John Wayne Gacy did not act " in the name of God, " Christian or otherwise. If Muslims want to be accepted in this or any nation( an apparently dubious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our culture( within reason of course, no one expects you to eat pork for example) and do not expect us to adopt yours - although it is reasonable for the respectful to expect respect in return. <p> BTW. Only the most uninformed of people quote Wikipedia - the encyclopedia that can be edited by " anybody. " <h> Tom in Michigan 1.10.11 @ 2:08PM <p> By the way ; what is your explanation for my other son 's erstwhile friend 's refusal to join us for dinner because our table was " unclean? " This invitation is routinely extended to all guests in our home( like Muslims, we are obliged by our culture to hospitality to all) and has never been refused in such insulting fashion. I respect the young man 's right to politely refuse an invitation but, the insult - whether it was intended or not - was unnecessary, wholly gratuitious. I imagine he learned we were " unclean " from his parents? His imam? <h> FUCKING HYPOCRITE! 1.10.11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allah whereas Gacy did n't murder anybody in the name of Christ. At least he had the decency not to claim otherwise. You 're a repellent snake, an hypocrite toddler molester and a disgrace for mankind. I spit on your evil belief and I use qurans in my restroom. <h> Musl 1.10.11 @ 4:03AM <p> Tom, <p> I can relate to your concerns and appreciate your views. <p> My suggestions to Muslims following the extreme version of Islam and living in US is that they either respect the traditions, culture and law of their new land or if they do n't find it to their liking then they can simply leave US for their country of Origin or Ancestry. The ' extremist ' elements can not live in vacuum there and certainly makes it difficult for the moderate muslim community at large to live in peace side by side with their non muslim hosts. <h> Tom in Michigan 1.10.11 @ 7:04PM <p> You are mistaken taking Asif for a reasonable person. Do not patronize such a hateful hypocrite who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how heinous. As he dishonestly " deciphered " my two other anecdotes ; he will have no honest answer to my question regarding the young man who so disrespected my home and hospitality thanks perhaps to the hateful teachings to which he, Asif and the women in Pakistan been exposed. To quote John, " there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. " <p> I never learned hatred of anybody because of their religion or other aspects of their person. Indeed, I honor and respect other, particularly Asian cultures. I am fluent in Japanese, for example. However, those Muslims who have come among us to do harm or at least no good, will come to no good end themselves because, though we are a welcoming and diverse nation ; we have been aroused. <p> That being said, I welcome all, regardless of background who want to become good citizens or residents of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Musl 1.11.11 @ 2:59PM <p> Tim, I had supported Asif on his general pleas for not mixing a criminal with his religion. Unfortunately since yours was the last comment he had commented on( till then), I just put mine underneath his. No direct reference to your column here. Having stated the above, I would want to differ from Mr. Asif 's justification for those heinous incidents that you mentioned. <p> Let me explain here Mr. Tom. For a normal law and religion abiding Muslim of this world. All the three incidents you 've mentioned are detestable. If the intern in your son 's firm had a problem shaking hands, she should not have joined in the first place or at the most should have advised her employers of her hang ups and let them decide whether to hire her or not. Her actions have been an embarrassment for moderates of all religions. Period. <p> About your incident of those unfortunate ladies getting murdered. The husband and father are murderers as per their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no confusion in that neither any moral or religious justification. They should be hanged. Period. <p> And as for your third incident of the Nigerian not eating food at your place. This is again an act not appreciated in Islam as our prophet Mohammed used to break bread with people of other faiths. His stand was unless you do n't make friends with people of other faiths how can you spread the good will of Islam. <p> All the three acts of Muslims in your scenarios are due to following some extreme distorted version of Islam promoted by some psycho Mullah( priests), something not followed by mainstream Muslims. <p> Let me assure you, such extremists elements are also not appreciated in Islamic countries. Why do you think there are so many suicide bombings going on in Pakistan on Muslim Pakistanis themselves. That 's because they as a nation are trying to resist the 0.5%( approx. 850,000) extremely violent, vocal and fanatic population spread within them and hence paying a heavy price for that. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting, unfortunately. <p> Hence the least these moderate muslims world over expect from the Western World is understanding, compassion and a general understanding of their true religion( and not the religion project by our extremist element). <h> NO RAGHEAD IN USA! 1.10.11 @ 8:04AM <p> Asif Yukherd, you mention this : http : **25;5162;TOOLONG..... l? ire... The media would have reacted as they did when a muslim traitor shot 10 soldiers in Fort Hood : " An infortunate accident, the alleged shooter felt he was being discriminated against. Let 's not stigmatize a religion and so on... " The usual crap from useful fellow travelers. <h> WTF 1.10.11 @ 4:13AM <h> Freddy 1.10.11 @ 7:36AM <p> I am reminded of the term " you get the government you deserve. " If the majority of these " goat lovers " are happy with their lot, then those who are n't should leave. I was all in support of our punitive expedition in 2001-4. Now it is just wasted tax dollars. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few million scattered surplus firearms, and sit back and watch the cage fight on ESPN via predator drone. <p> Hey - squeamish website, honourable search around some blogs, seems a pretty overnice program you are using. I 'm currently using Wordpress for a few of my sites but hunt to transfer one of them over to a construction related to yours as a endeavor run. Anything in portion you would advise some it? <p> Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave daughter and said " You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear. " She put the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely
