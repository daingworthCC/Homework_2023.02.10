5158241 <h> Tell Me A Little Bit About Yourself? What to Say in a Job Interview <p> At Resumes Australia, we offer one-to-one interview coaching packages that help aspiring executive candidates to find their interview edge and gain a competitive advantage over other applicants( and yes, as our name suggests, we also write resumes!). One of the most frequent questions I 'm asked during my interview coaching sessions is : " when I 'm asked to explain a little about myself, what should I say? " <h> Why this Question? <p> The " tell me a little bit about yourself " question is often a common opener in interviews : some employers see it as simply an ice-breaking question while others will be expecting to hear a succinct yet stimulating summary about who you are and where you are headed professionally. Generally they are looking for information about how you 'll fit into the company and the position for which you are applying. They 're not looking for your life story, so do n't go into a diatribe about things that have no bearing on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job and what you can bring to the table. Emphasise that you have the skill sets outlined in the job description, and how your career has developed and implemented those skills. <h> Be Professional &; Prepared <p> Remaining professional at all times in a job interview is key. While it 's essential to be personable, courteous and friendly, you should focus your answer around your career and professional outlook. <p> To prevent being caught off guard with this question, I spend time with my interview coaching candidates to help them prepare an answer that they are comfortable with, and that will appeal to the employer. <p> My best tips include : <p> Keep it job-focused : You will want to keep your answer focused on your career achievements and goals, but you also need to make sure that it is relevant to the job you 're interviewing for. For instance, if the interview is for a management role, you should focus on your management strengths, rather than on other accountabilities. <p> Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific in your explanation by focusing on your unique selling point. Describe your most important achievement or talent, and explain briefly what it is, using precise details( e.g. how many dollars, percentage increase, etc.). <p> Keep it short &; sweet : Your answer should be sharp and concise, and no more than a few sentences long. It should also be positive, so stay away from any negative details about your career( e.g. " I 'm keen to broaden my horizons " rather than " my current job is too limiting). <h> What You Should n't Say <p> When you are asked the " tell me about yourself " question or any other range of questions in an interview, there are certain responses that you should stay away from. These can make you appear unprofessional, unsuitable for the role, and ill-equipped for the interview. <p> " What do you want to know? " is a response that you should never use. This is unhelpful to the interviewer, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Similarly, steer clear of mentioning anything that might make you seem unsuitable for the job. If you 're applying for a corporate management position, saying " I 'm a hardworking executive who 's known to be a bit of a slave driver " is not an encouraging response, since this is not the ideal behaviour for a manager. <p> If you are applying for a sales role, you should also avoid answers like, " I 'm trying to develop my sales skills. " This might be true, but it gives the interviewer the impression that you 're not a seasoned sales rep and as such you are probably not right for the role. <p> Interview coaching can significantly improve the way you perform in an interview, from what you say in your responses, to the way you present yourself from the moment you walk through the door. <p> Get in touch with Resumes Australia today to discover how we can sharpen your interviews skills, revise
