5126141 <h> Our house is a very fine house( do you want to buy it?) <p> The walls and trim are painted. The floors look like kids never trod on them. The outside landscaping is the best it has ever been.( We even edged!) Once I get a blasted gutter person to give me a call back, the house will be violation free. This baby is ready to list. <p> As long as my kids live somewhere else. <p> It is weird to have the house all fixed up. It is finally what we envisioned 10 years ago when we stepped into this little bungalow. I almost did n't look at it because I could n't get past the hideous bushes growing in the front of the house. <p> The first thing we did was rip out those bushes. And then we lived with the house as it was until the bathrooms and kitchen screamed, " REPAIR ME "( actually they just started leaking and the plumber finally said he could n't fix them any longer) and for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 10. I hope the next owners appreciate the house the way I meant to. It makes me a little sad that we are n't going to get to enjoy it more. <p> Selling the house feels like a popularity contest. I check the real estate listings to see how our house compares to the others out on the market in our price range and square footage. I oscillate constantly between thinking our house will never sell, and betting myself it will be snatched up right away. <p> The kids are starting to get a little irritated at the whole process. It started with me throwing a few toys into a box with their okay, and then I started sweeping my hand across the dresser into a box hidden below while they were n't looking. They will go around the house looking for their favorite car, doll or book and I will say, " Sorry, it is in the attic. " And they will get a dejected look on their face and I am pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She loves to exclaim, " No Mommy, mine toy. MINE TOY! " <p> Then we changed their wall colors. We had the painters cover their beloved wall art and sticker collection that they painstakingly placed on the wall, then moved, then placed again, and then moved. So there are little grimy sticky marks all over their wall. Probably why it took the painters several days in their room. <p> After that I started rearranging furniture. They would run to flop in their favorite chair only to find it moved to a different wall. Or in a different room. Once they get used to the new arrangement I will have most likely moved it back to where it was because the " Flow " was all wrong. I received quite a few glares for that one. <p> The worst, is when I dared to take the leaf piles and bag them for garbage collection. Isaac was terrified I had ruined his fall and " Most perfect leaf jumping pile. " <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean <p> I am tired and the kids are cranky and we have n't even started showing the house yet. Just wait till they realize they can no longer leave their clothes wherever they want to or eat outside of the kitchen. <p> They might revolt. <p> One thing I am certain of is that Michael will be grateful when it is all over. Trying to find contractors to fix city violations, or take care of all the little DIY projects that build up over 10 years has been grating. Especially since work has been so busy for him. All he wants to do at the end of the night is sit and relax and there I am with a screwdriver and a flashlight saying, " OK which light switch do we replace tonight! " or " Do you want to fix that pull cord you just ripped out in the laundry room? " <p> For now, I am going to sit back and relax and enjoy how awesome our house finally is. It is clean, decluttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at grandma and grandpa 's house. <p> What is your experience with selling a house? How do you keep the
