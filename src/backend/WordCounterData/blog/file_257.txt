5133941 <p> Hiring a PR firm to get a head coach fired for not playing your son does not preclude one from calling a college football game, nor does it preclude one from voting as a member of the media. Craig James casts an AP ballot. His Top 25 this past week was rather interesting. Here are some of the highlights. <p> Boise State is No. 24. Let me repeat that. Boise State is No. 24. The Broncos are 10-1 with a one-point loss to TCU. They have n't played the toughest schedule, but a tougher one statistically than Virginia Tech( James -- 4), Houston( James -- 5), Michigan State( James -12) and Wisconsin( James -- 13). <p> Boise State beat James ' 11th ranked team, Georgia, by two touchdowns in a de facto road game. They have fewer losses. Yet, somehow, they are ranked 13 places lower. They are ranked behind five-loss Missouri and four-loss Texas. Boise at 10-1 against the 51st ranked schedule is No. 24. Houston at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Seriously, did Chris Petersen not answer his text messages? Was he a little curt during a stop and chat in the gym? We 'll assume that 's not an optimistic sign for Kellen Moore and Doug Martin 's chances of winning the Pony Express Award. <p> Arkansas is No. 3. The Razorbacks are 10-2. They have only lost to LSU and Alabama. Fine. They were also clearly outclassed in both games. What is their best win? South Carolina? A comeback against 6-6 Texas A &M?; <p> Oklahoma is No. 17. Kansas State is No. 8. Oklahoma is No. 17. Oklahoma has the same number of losses as the Wildcats. Oklahoma beat them by 41 points in Manhattan! There is no plausible argument for the Wildcats being a better team, let alone a demonstrably better one. That is insane. <p> Stanford is No. 10. I can see not being sold on Stanford. How are they ranked below No. 7 USC when Stanford beat USC and has fewer losses? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games that also counted, they scraped by against Minnesota and Utah and lost by three touchdowns against Arizona State, who just had their coach fired. <p> Clemson is Unranked. I do n't think Clemson is that good. That said, Clemson is 9-3 and beat James No. 4 team, Virginia Tech, by 20 in Blacksburg. They beat Florida State( James -25) and have a better record against a tougher schedule. <p> Not sure what Craig James ' justification for these votes would be. I am sure said justification would be accompanied by his smarmy politician smile. James is both the lead bad voter( 885) and the lead good voter( 168) on PollSpeak.com this week. That poor Spaeth intern needs to pick up his pace. <p> I just do n't get how someone could say Boise is n't a top-15 team at the absolute worst. I 'd have them in the top-10 personally, though I will say that they beat a UGA team that is so much different now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James. He is the epitome of the rich daddy who does n't give a fuck what happens to anyone as long their kid does n't have to sweat or get a little dirty. And he looks like a every southern racist guy from every movie ever. <p> Thats the 12th best team according to these Sagarian rankings. Anyone else find it strange that duffy calls the BCS all kinds of nasty names yet loves pointing to Sagarians garbage numbers to make ridiculous claims. <p> Thats the 12th best team according to these Sagarian rankings. Anyone else find it strange that duffy calls the BCS all kinds of nasty names yet loves pointing to Sagarians garbage numbers to make ridiculous claims. <p> It is pretty funny. Those ratings are garbage. Imagine if Craig James had Missouri at 18. Duffy would be pissed. <p> Thats the 12th best team according to these Sagarian rankings.

Those ratings are garbage. Imagine if Craig James had Missouri at 18. Duffy would be pissed. <p> What ratings would you prefer I used? BCS? Numbers pulled out of my ass? <p> Fuck Craig James.

And he looks like a every southern racist guy from every movie ever. <p> What ratings would you prefer I used? BCS? Numbers pulled out of my ass? <p> Not those as they 're garbage. If there are n't any you like, come up with a metric that you do like. You 've got the time, right? But it 's funny that you rail the computers in the BCS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Clemson 28th at 9-3. <p> Not those as they 're garbage. If there are n't any you like, come up with a metric that you do like. You 've got the time, right? But it 's funny that you rail the computers in the BCS and then praise the ratings that have Missouri 18th at 7-5 and Clemson 28th at 9-3. <p> But, if I 'm going to use the ratings that meet my own subjective judgements... those are n't objective ratings. <p> I use the Sagarin w/MOV mostly for strength of schedule. I like Simple Rating System or FEI for comparing teams. <p> Every computerized system has Texas A &M; ranked highly, because they had one of the country 's toughest schedules. They had to play Oklahoma State, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas State, Baylor.... then teams like Missouri, Texas... 8/12 opponents are going to bowl games 4 in the Top 15. <p> What that says is if the played say Florida, Vanderbilt, Tennessee, Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been 9-3 or 10-2. <p> Every computerized system has Texas A &M; ranked highly, because they had one of the country 's toughest schedules.

One at 23... <p> They have n't played the toughest schedule, but a tougher one statistically than Virginia Tech( James -- 4) <p> This is why I give LSU a pass if they lose to UGA( or really Alabama). They at least played a tough schedule. I 'd bet @WVU and vs. Oregon is the best top two non-conf wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into account that WVU was supposed to be a lot better when they were scheduled). <p> Craig James is that guy in the locker room who walks out of the shower without a towel, then walks straight towards the sink, and brushes his teeth. Spits onto the floor drain and then tries to play grab ass <p> Arkansas is No. 3. The Razorbacks are 10-2. They have only lost to LSU and Alabama. Fine. They were also clearly outclassed in both games. What is their best win? South Carolina? A comeback against 6-6 Texas A &M?; <p> Oklahoma is No. 17. Kansas State is No. 8. Oklahoma is No. 17.

There is no plausible argument for the Wildcats being a better team, let alone a demonstrably better one. That is insane. <p> Does n't this all reek of setting up the LSU-Bama rematch? The biggest threat to that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls, or beating a high-ranked( Oklahoma) team. <p> craig james waits for a par 5 green to clear from 320 out after finding his 180 yard drive. <p> Craig James crouches behind a 12 ft putt and cups his hands over his eyes for 2 minutes, reading the break. Finally, he stands over the ball and gently whispers " putt to the picture " before making his stroke. Incidentally, the ball races 10 feet by the hole, starting the process anew. <p> Craig James crouches behind a 12 ft putt and cups his hands over his eyes for 2 minutes, reading the break. Finally, he stands over the ball and gently whispers " putt to the picture " before making his stroke. Incidentally, the ball races 10 feet by the hole, starting the process anew. <p> sounds like craig james understands the importance of a pre-shot routine. <p> But anyway, OSU has much better wins than Alabama. And Alabama lost at home. <p> I agree. OKST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think Bama is the better team. If OKST gets in than so be it. I would hope no one outside of Bama would complain about it. I know LSU folks would be thrilled, as the thought of playing OKST would get dicks fully erect in Baton Rouge. LSU or Bama would be 10 point favorites over the Pokes in NO. <p> OKST is more deserving of a shot at the title, but I think Bama is the better team. <p> I am all aboard this train. If Alabama could play anyone other than LSU, I 'd put them in no problem. But with an already fucked system I want a true national champion. Alabama winning would n't give us that, IMO. <p> Craig James has the honor on the second tee on a packed Saturday afternoon and wants to tell you a 5 minute story about his awesome Friday. <p> Craig James just put his 7 iron away. The third leaf from the left on the second tree from the right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green fluttered. He 's opted for a choked 6 iron. Oops... it 's in the water. <p> Craig James just put his 7 iron away. The third leaf from the left on the second tree from the right at a 46* angle from the 2 o'clock position on the green fluttered.

OKST is more deserving of a shot at the title, but I think Bama is the better team. If OKST gets in than so be it. I would hope no one outside of Bama would complain about it. I know LSU folks would be thrilled, as the thought of playing OKST would get dicks fully erect in Baton Rouge. LSU or Bama would be 10 point favorites over the Pokes in NO. <p> No way. They are favored by 10.5. Lines tend to come within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEC bump and you are looking at more than 4 but less than 7. <p> Craig James does not mark anything at his ' garage sales ' with a price. When someone asks him how much for an item. He simply responds that its not for sale, everything is free, this is a charity give away. <p> Craig James is jealous of BSU because they have achieved everything he failed to do at SMU. Oh wait, that 's serious. Craig James was responsible for Omar Epps replacing Wesley Snipes in Major League II. <p> Craig James tried to invent the internet, but Al Gore beat him to it. Later, after gleaning some key information from Senator Ted Stevens, James tried again, and purchased a series of tubes online. He made a couple of mathematical errors, and ended up forming those tubes into a dump truck, which the internet decidedly is n't. So he gave the truck to his precious, precious son to take to college. And Mike Leach took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 5 Americans are unable to find the USA on a map : " Personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some... people out there in our nation do n't have maps and uh, I believe that our, ah, education like such as in South Africa, and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should, uh, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., or should help South Africa, it should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future, for. " <p> Craig James is on the 1st tee with the rest of his foursome on a day when the course is uncrowded. He sees that you were going to play alone, but does n't let you tee off before his foresome, even though one guy in his group is at the snack bar buying a Heineken. <p> Its important to remember a few things about James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is James ' stance on Joe Paterno and should Joe have done more? What is James ' stance on Eric Dickerson and should James have done more to notify the NCAA that Dickerson was getting paid by SMU? <p> I think James suffers from little man syndrome. James never made it big in the NFL and in fact James, Dickerson and SMU could not even beat BYU in the 1980 Holiday Bowl as they gave away 21 points in the final 3 minutes of the game allowing BYU a 1 point victory. <p> Dickerson went on to a great NFL career. Jim McMahon from BYU also went on to a great NFL career. Kyle Whittingham of BYU is now head coach at Utah. James? James is just a lowly ESPN analyst. I think he is an underachiever and thus talks incessantly promoting his views and trying to expound great knowledge. Lets face it that if he was that intelligent or talented his career would have been more than it was. Talking about it now is all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want anyone else to get theirs either. He chooses any angle to support his view even if the result is contradictory logic supporting one team one way and another team in the exact opposite manner. <p> Think about it Chad. James. Pollack. Palmer. McMahon. Dickerson. Montana. Young. As you say each name where do you know them from? Some you equate directly with great football. Some you only know from ESPN and you have to go search out their football past. <p> One last thing. Coach Mike Leach locked Craig James ' son in a dark closet. The fruit does n't fall far from the tree. Tell James to stick that in his pipe and smoke it. <p> Craig James waffles on his decision to join your fantasy league until the last minute before saying " yes. " Then does n't pay the $20 entry fee for 12 weeks. When you ask him for a check, he says, " Do you have Pay Pal? " <p> Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replica of his SMU #32 jersey. He then insists letting the dog do whatever he wants, including shitting on the floor, taking up the whole couch, and turning over the trash can for food scraps. <p> Craig James has deep burn! Oh, it 's so deep! Oh, Craig James can barely lift his right arm ' cause Craig James did so many arm curls. Craig James do n't know if you heard him counting, Craig James did over a thousand. You have your ubulus muscle which connects to the upper dorcinus. It 's boring but it 's Craig James ' life, <p> craig james is absolutely certain BallzDeep will be here imminently to claim that this thread does n't count, and that some stupid " during a basketball " thread is still the longest, despite being no better than 4th longest. <p> craig james is absolutely certain BallzDeep will be here imminently to claim that this thread does n't count, and that some stupid " during a basketball " thread is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Craig James would like you to read a pamphlet and go to a day long conference with him about possibly buying time together in a condo in Long Beach. Seems like a good deal and you get a waffle iron just for showing up. <p> craig james is absolutely certain BallzDeep will be here imminently to claim that this thread does n't count, and that some stupid " during a basketball " thread is still the longest, despite being no better than 4th longest. <p> Oh, no. This thread definitely counts. Thought it does deserve some kind of asterisk. And it 's been a while since I 've been called BallzDeep. <p> craig james watched Alien Autopsy, and after it was over told several people he would have done a better job on the autopsy. He told several others he was a more worthy specimen for study than a dumb alien. <p> If you were n't around then, I really ca n't describe the Stephen King fatigue that existed in the world. Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made, like one every six months. And believe it or not, Gump was a special effects masterpiece, at the time. <p> I do n't take it personal. Let me just say that if Craig James had grown up in suburban Washington in the 80s he would probably write things like this about his sports memories : My favorite baseball team sucked during my childhood( Yankees). My favorite basketball team was awesome( Lakers), so the memories were many. The Jets were mostly awful, and I was too young to really enjoy the 1986 playoff season. <p> I have seen multiple examples of other people repeating other jokes and comments from earlier in the thread but can not find any example of when I repeated a comment. So in conclusion, fuck you sportsgal you miserable cunt. <p> I remember Jim Joyce. I do n't really know why you 'd remember it vividly though since you 're not a Tigers fan. <p> It 's an old meme. I claimed to remember Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And while I do remember watching the 49ers beat the Bengals, I may have over-spoke my recollections. Though I do clearly remember learning the word ' horse-shit ' during that game. <p> I think it 'll end when that one guy that always shows up way after a thread has died comments on it. Maybe he already has. I always forget his name. I 've been told recently and even seen him comment in the last two weeks. But that is when it will be time to re-post the link to Boyz II Men. Until then, Bueller, Craig James would like to remind you in the most prickish way possible that you are not " in on this thread " until you 've made an honest to god attempt at a Craig James joke <p> Craig James pulls out from a complete stop in the left lane to cut you off in the right lane at a red light. Just so he can be the first car at the light, while also keeping you and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig-James-o-sexual : People through their awful personalities or homeliness who make a conscious decision to become bisexual, thereby doubling potential sexual partners yet still remain unfuckable to everyone. <p> As used in the sentence : After all the guys rejected Craig James advances as a craig-james-o-sexual the lowest point was when the 5 dead hookers wanted nothing to do with the fugly douchebag bastard <p> Craig James controls the British Crown Craig James keeps the metric system down Fuck him! Fuck him! Craig James leaves Atlantis off the maps Craig James keeps the Martians under wraps Fuck him! Fuck him! Craig James holds back the electric car Craig James makes Steve Gutenberg a star! Fuck him! Fuck him! Craig James robs cavefish of their sight Craig James rigs every Oscar night Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuuuuuuck Hiiiimmmmmmmmmm! <p> Craig James just happens to randomly like all the sports teams which won titles when he was growing up. <p> Except for in baseball where his local team went from being world champs to being the worst team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his childhood. Baseball sucks anyway, right Craig James? I mean the ratings are horrible. <p> Craig James hangs a Van Gogh print and a Pollock print in his office and tries to pass them off as originals. He then starts wearing tweed jackets with leather patches on the elbows and starts pronouncing it " eye-ther " and " nye-ther ". <p> Craig James is not allowed within 50 yards of a Toys ' R Us. When you bring this us, he starts muttering under his breath about how " With a neck like that, you 'd think a giraffe would have a better gag reflex. " <p> Craig James knows that the cheerleader you 're sitting next to is interested in you, so he tries to bring up the time that you drunkenly passed out and pissed yourself as many times as possible over the course of the night. Then he takes out his phone and tries to sit in between the two of you so that he can show her the pictures. <p> Craig James tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth has never gotten past the second fight with Bald Bull and has only fought Tyson because he scribbled 007-373-5963 on the back of his controller way back in 1988. <p> Craig James keeps old opera tickets in his pockets at all times so that he can ' accidentslly ' pull then out when he is ostensibly getting his keys. If no one says anything about them, he loudly informs everyone that he has a season subscription..... by the motherfuckin orchestra. <p> Craig James contends that the drive between San Antonio and El Paso ai n't got nothin ' on the drive between Dallas and Amarillo when it comes to flat and featureless. In this case, Craig James might be correct. <p> Craig James says he once spent Christmas with Robert Earl Keen and his family, and nobody got drunk or went to the Quik-Pak for some Marlboro Lights. And the Mexican boyfriend refused to sing " Feliz Navidad, " even though Craig asked him very politely, time and again. <p> Craig James once went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat guy with a beard came out and just noodled on a piano for a while, so he left. But he got to see Maria Bamford in that Target commercial later, so it was okay. <p> Craig James, let 's face it. And I 'm not being funny. I mean no disrespect, but you 're a cunt. You 're a cunt now, and you 've always been a cunt. And the only thing that 's going to change is that you 're going to be an even bigger cunt. Maybe have some more cunt kids. <p> Craig James, let 's face it. And I 'm not being funny. I mean no disrespect, but you 're a cunt. You 're a cunt now, and you 've always been a cunt. And the only thing that 's going to change is that you 're going to be an even bigger cunt. Maybe have some more cunt kids. <p> Craig James( wave at the cunt) just tried to Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching himself in 1 man 1 cup again as mentioned in comment 2459 of the definitive online guide to Craig James. <p> Craig James wants TBL commenters to know that whoever hits 3,000 in this thread will receive a hearty handshake and an autosigned copy of Game Day : A Rollicking Journey to the Heart of College Football. <p> i love t-shirts. two of my favorites are nearing the end. my NFL on TNT shirt I won in a radio contest, and my Pirate Radio 96.3FM( or something), Less Music by Dead Guys that i bought in the tattoo parlor i got my only tattoo in, on venice beach, 1992 <p> ballz, one of the great skills of a leader is knowing how and when to delegate <p> please handle this t-shirt project for us, and keep us in the loop <p> We 're gon na need at least 20 people for my dad to even bother making the screen. And he 'll still charge me. Just at a discount. Oh yea! And nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt means. But I 'll do it. If we can get enough people to do it. <p> craig james wants to have the checkout person look through the weekly flyer to check for sales prices and start/end dates, then void some things because they were n't on sale, then pays with a check all while you do your best to not huff and motherfucking puff behind them because you picked that lane because she was nearly all checked out <p> My dad gave me 2 Led Zeppelin shirts and 2 Pink Floyd shirts that are totally bootlegged and illegal for Christmas a couple years ago( do n't tell anyone). He just used old album art. I 'm sure he can re-create whatever your shirts are. <p> When Hollywood gets around to making a film version of Game Day : A Rollicking Journey to the Heart of College Football, Craig James is hoping that Norm MacDonald will be considered for the role of Craig James. <p> I remember one time Craig James took his family to Sea World. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! So James yells, " I 'm Craig James and no one gets me wet! " So he climbs into the tank, grabs Shamu and throws the whale into the audience, splashes him and yells, " How do you like it?! " And then damn if James did n't step in there and finish the show! <p> Craig James keeps his stereo at highest possible volume and the heater on high when he drops his car off at a valet stand. When he picks it up later and the valet has lowered the volume and turned off the heater, he throws a hissy fit and threatens to sue. <p> Once Craig James found out that you go to the gym, he constantly says that you should wear more form fitting shirts, makes comments that he wants to see your arms sometime, and that he should work out with you. <p> Craig James remains profoundly upset with his Uncle Jimmy, who poured millions of dollars propping up inept radio station WNYX in Noo Yawk but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering up hooker slayings back in Texas. <p> When Craig James ' kids ask why they never go anywhere for vacation, he tells them they they went to Paris when they were young, but all their luggage got stolen, and that 's why they do n't have any pictures. <p> Craig James has some new information about Colt McCoy 's concussion. McCoy was placed in an electrical closet between getting knocked out of the game and being re-inserted( James ' word) into the contest <p> Craig James used to return every tape to Blockbuster with a handwritten note inside stating that not only did he not rewind, but he owns one of those tape rewinding machines, and STILL did n't do it. He also enclosed a picture of his bare ass and wrote on it " smooches if you 're pissed ". <p> Craig James thinks Vic Colfari is a completely reasonable commenter and not at all trying to hide a horrid case of smalldickitis. Craig James also thinks that TBL was right to ban Taguchi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned. <p> Craig James knows the dialogue to " Birth Of A Nation " -- even though it 's in subtitles. And if you see it with him( which is impossible not to because its on loop at his house) he will speak the lines to you <p> Craig James wants you to understand exactly what it is that makes Birth of a Nation a great film and here 's a tip for you : it ai n't all that fancy-pants editing and camera-masking bullshit they teach kids in film school. It 's a great story with a great message. <p> Craig James wants to hire Marvin Lewis as replay coordinator for his senate campaign. Marvin Lewis is a little bit nervous about agreeing to the position because : a) Craig James might not win, b) NFL head coach is a much higher paying gig, c) Craig James killed 5 hookers <p> To be fair to Craig James, 5 verifiable dead hookers is n't really a small sample size in the big scheme of things. Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only the ones that we know about for sure. <p> Craig James printed out this entire thread and brought it to his lawyer because he wanted to sue all of us for libel. His lawyer read it over, and told Craig that you ca n't sue someone for libel if they are telling the truth. <p> After craig james hurt his shoulder soph yr of college and stopped playing ball he got caught in that hooker game. yr later we went to cop some whore opened the sliding door on the van and blasted a lady of the night in the gut. still fucked her. <p> craig james was having lunch at the mall when this old man fell down the escalator. this kid yelled out " have a nice trip? " while the old man 's shopping bag was strewn about and as soon as the kid started to laugh, the old man got up and started to beat the kid... and i mean really lay into him. the kid never had a chance and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life left in him. when he finally got dragged off, the old man calmly dusted himself off, straightened his jacket and started to gather his things... <p> When trying on shoes at the mall, Craig James makes the elderly salesman with the bad back put the shoes on his feet and tie them. Because if he did n't want to hurt his bad, he should n't be a shoe salesman. <p> craig james had a sneaking suspicion his wife was cheating on him one day, so he heads home after the front 9. he just ca n't shake this feeling that something 's up and starts to speed home. flying into his development, one of the barton boys chases a basketball into the street directly in front of craig james ' big ranch f-150, narrowly becoming hamburger. there 's a mercedes in the driveway and the sounds of intense lovemaking echoing throughout the cul-de-sac. he opens the door,
