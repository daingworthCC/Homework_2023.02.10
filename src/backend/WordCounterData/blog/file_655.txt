5173941 <h> Farmingdale festival welcomes neighbors to get to know town <p> FARMINGDALE -- The first Farmingdale Community Festival is a long-awaited event that will take place in the borough on Oct. 6. <p> The gathering was a notion 10 years ago when Bill Shaffer, a current member of the Farmingdale K-8 School District Board of Education, approached municipal officials with the idea. <p> " In 2002, I had gone to the Borough Council because I wanted to organize a downtown cruise night, but I could not get enough( response), " he said. <p> Shaffer said he and other people continued to talk about holding a festival in town. <p> In June 2011, an area car club and several local business operators held a small affair at the Farmingdale Methodist Church, Shaffer said. <p> " We wanted to see how a future, larger event would go over, " he said. <p> In November 2011, local business owners Carey Cossentino and her husband, John, collaborated with the Farmingdale Chamber of Commerce to spearhead a car and truck show which attracted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was a huge undertaking, " he said. <p> But it was worth it. <p> The event benefited the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots program and the Joshua House, a nonprofit organization that supplies clothing and food to individuals in need of support. <p> " I think it 's pretty cool that people who do n't live in the borough have such a passion about doing something in town, " Shaffer said of the Cossentinos, who are residents of Jackson. <p> He said that after the fall event, residents decided to go forward with a full-fledged festival. <p> " We took all the positives from the event that was held downtown last year and decided to move it to the school grounds this year, " he said, adding that he is pleased a Farmingdale community party is finally possible. <p> " All I wanted to do was have an event that will bring all of the organizations in town together, " Shaffer said, " There are a lot of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities that are going on. " <p> Event planners have called upon nonprofit organizations and for-profit vendors to be part of the day. <p> " We have a mix between outside vendors, community organizations, and businesses that are based in Farmingdale, " Shaffer said. <p> Beau Byrtus, who is organizing the vendors, said he hopes the event will be a way of letting others know about Farmingdale. <p> " We are looking for a really great day to get the surrounding communities out to introduce Farmingdale to see what a wonderful town we have, " Byrtus said. <p> Money raised at the festival will go to the revitalization of the playground behind the Farmingdale Elementary School. The planned upgrades consist of three phases, according to Schaffer. <p> The first phase was resurfacing the playground and removing/replacing older equipment. The second phase enlarged the playground and added new equipment. Money raised for the third phase of the project would help to pay for additional equipment and repairs to an old ballfield. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for students to be able to practice and play on a safe field, " he said. <p> Farmingdale Mayor Jay Morgan will sacrifice himself by volunteering to sit in a dunk tank. <p> " It 's a great idea and a nice fundraiser for the playground equipment, which can be used, of course, by anybody in the community, " the mayor said. <p> The Farmingdale Community Festival will take place from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Oct. 6 at the Farmingdale Elementary School, 49 Academy St. The rain date for the event is Oct. 7.
