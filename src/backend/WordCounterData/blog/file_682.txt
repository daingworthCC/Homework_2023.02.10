5176641 <p> Morning-after analysis of the final debate in the presidential race. President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney on foreign policy. <p> President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney met in Boca Raton, Fla., last night for their third and final debate. In the 90-minute program moderated by Bob Scheiffer, the president and his challenger sought to highlight their differences related to the U.S. role in the world, including America 's military budget, U.S.-China relations and the ongoing unrest in the Arab world. But both candidates also sought to lead the discussion to the economy and jobs, issues believed to be the central drivers of the upcoming election. Please join us to talk about what we heard from candidates last night and where the campaigns go from here. <h> Guests <p> E.J. Dionne Jr. <p> senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, columnist for The Washington Post and author of " Our Divided Political Heart : The Battle for the American Idea in an Age of Discontent. " <p> The President showed he saw the big picture, had a strategy behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of nations and not isolated and bellicose, He cared about the children in S'derot, Israel running to bomb shelters from missiles fired by Hamas. He stressed that among the team of nations in the Mideast, Israel is our strongest ally, while stressing that his more encompassing strategy resulted in an Iran isolated from the rest of the world, including almost all of the Arab world. <p> The President stressed the need for nation building at home with education, especially science and math for kids to develop into world leading researchers, and stressed that the Governor 's tax plan takes away all the money that could provide resources and teachers who train students to develop skills for productive jobs, thus preventing the kids from having a fair shot to be our future scientists and leaders, which is in contrast to what America has always done in the past. He called Romney on his claim as a leader on education. After all, Romney did have massive firings of teachers throughout Massachusetts. Not exactly a stellar performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Romney showed he was weak on details, talked around the question to take up time, when not sure of an answer said I agree with the President, and when Romney was confronted by the President for his, Romney 's, constant flip-flopping, the Governor feigned being hurt and decried the President for picking on him. It also appeared that Romney 's hair looked darker on top and less gray on the sides to ostensibly make him appear as a younger and stronger leader than he really is. Instead, Romney looked like a contender caught in a ring where he was the clear weakling and amateur. <p> October 22, 2012 - 11:14 pm <p> Steve Gewirtz wrote : <p> What does Romney stand for? He showed once again that he tries to tell a given audience what he thinks that it wants to hear. We still have no idea what he really believes. Is telling people what he thinks they want to hear a habit he got into when he was a Mormon missionary in France? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running Bain Capital? Does he really believe that people will not notice that he is an etch-a-sketch candidate? <p> Romney would not admit that his positions were different from those he had taken earlier or during the primaries. Was he afraid of how his father 's presidential run was over after he said that he had been " brainwashed " about Vietnam? <p> Republicans have generally taken hard right positions even in general election campaigns for president, on the apparent assumption that the key to winning is turning out their base. In moderating his positions, did Romney risk losing some of his base( in the sense that they will stay home rather than vote for him)? <p> With Obama, we know that we will get a president who will carry out a competent foreign policy. With Romney, we have to ask which Romney is the real Romney, the one who seemed to agree with Obama on almost everything in this latest debate or the one who seems all too ready to start a war with Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney lost the election in this third debate. <p> October 23, 2012 - 12:01 am <p> PhilyeahPhil wrote : <p> Why was n't the european debt crisis ever discussed? this was a foreign policy debate and both candidates love to talk about the economy so it seems like that would have been a logical topic to discuss, since Europe is certainly having an effect on the US economy. <p> October 23, 2012 - 7:47 am <p> ecgberht wrote : <p> Left already out loaded for bear with their talking points this AM.

The Osama bin Laden raid and killing has been overplayed by Obama and the campaign from the start, it 's like a guy taking credit for building the house when all he did was put the door knobs on.

This has been true in all of the debates. If they were in family therapy instead of debating I 'd say this reflects Obama 's emphasis on his team working together while Romney reflects blatant individualism. This certainly harkens to their roots : Obama the community organizer and Romney the lone-wolf entreprenuer. <p> October 23, 2012 - 8:26 am <p> ecgberht wrote : <p> Jim Gamble asked : " Makes you wonder ; why is this guy running again? " <p> Because the economy is in shambles, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are struggling for work, and the Middle East is on fire. <p> Those seem like pretty good reasons to me. <p> October 23, 2012 - 8:33 am <p> partisan politics wrote : <p> gwendrews wrote : " As a psychotherapist for 30 years I find it striking that Obama predominantly uses " we " when he describes his accomplishments while Romney predominantly uses " I " " <p> I see malpractice in your analysis Dr.. Obama is notorious for the use of " I " in his speeches. The point is the debates are about Romney selling himself in the first person, where Obama needs to sell himself as a part of a regime. <p> October 23, 2012 - 8:54 am <p> climatewiz1 wrote : <p> Damage control after the fact and excuses for inaction is not a strong foreign policy. <p> - Ask the 4 killed in Benghazi... - Ask those killed in 9/11 - Ask those killed on the USS Cole <p> October 23, 2012 - 8:57 am <p> Ferdnam wrote : <p> partisan politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small.

But the opinion of this European guest in your country is that Romney sounded extraordinarily vacuous and Obama seemed cool, collected, and in control of the facts... I continue to be disturbed by Romney 's dancing around the truth... Well, let 's just say that Romney seems to have problems being truthful. Careful segmentation leads to differential and contradictory messages to different statistically significant groupings of " customers.

If it means that a general statement about terror attacks in a speech suddenly refers to Benghazi, or that what was known by intelligence sources as an Al Qaeda terrorist attack within 24 hours is suddenly a spontaneous mob action for the next two weeks, then I agree with you, " it would be a shame ".

I believe that the President is critical of Romney 's messages and has an obligation to the American people to clarify the issues and set the record straight. In fact, it 's my perception that but for attacks on Obama( with the exception of last night during which he was most agreeable), Mr. Romney has very little to offer. Who 's to say that because you 've been successful in business you are fit and/or qualified to run the country??? It 's all about a person 's character for me. <p> October 23, 2012 - 9:22 am <p> jordan8888 wrote : <p> This is a terrible panel.

" The problem is that the marketing school of thought yields strategies of imitation rather than innovation... In other words, let us say what each set of customer wants to hear rather than develop a comprehensive and innovative policy( economic policy, foreign policy, trade policy, etc...). Romney has perfectly internalized the marketing school of thought of the late 70s. And he behaves accordingly. The message is customized to each set of customers... And since there are multiple sets, there are multiple messages. This is actually taught in B-schools <p> October 23, 2012 - 9:25 am <p> Dar Thomas wrote : <p> OMG. Get me a map!

In the north, it borders the Caspian Sea.

I find this particularly duplicitous. I hope that the American people are paying attention to his shifting stands/sands and his lack of grasp of how diplomacy works in the modern world. Romney kept moving off the foreign policy topics to attack the economy. I regret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment is down, consumer confidence is up, new housing starts and home sales are up, and new foreclosure filings are down. The Republican legislators have blocked many of the things that President Obama would have done to lead us out of this economic mess earlier. <p> October 23, 2012 - 9:41 am <p> Richard Dennis wrote : <p> I live in Sweden so I am please to be listening to issues about the United States via the Internet... but I must say Ramesh rom the National Review seemingly is having a difficult time showing that she is objective...
