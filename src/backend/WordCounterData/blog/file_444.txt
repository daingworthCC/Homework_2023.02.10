5152741 <p> Reggie Bush once dated Kim Kardashian. Now, I 'm not sure if this is something that the Miami Dolphins running back is proud of, or if it is something he would rather forget. We know that she has been around the block in terms of dating professional athletes Yes, I 'm considering her relationship to Kris Humphries and calling him an athlete. But Bush was not only her longest relationship, but it was clearly her most relevant. <p> But one of Bush 's current teammates in Miami, wide receiver Brian Hartline, had one question. <p> But before asking that question, he compared Kardashian to New York Jets back up quarterback, Tim Tebow. <p> Wait, what? <p> Give it a minute. Hartline makes a very valid point, at least to a certain degree. <p> " Everybody loves him Tebow, but the same people go with the Kardashians. I do n't know what they did, either, " Hartlien said. " They 're on magazine covers everywhere. I mean, honestly. I know they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I just do n't know how they got started. " <p> That is a good question. At least for Kardashian. <p> I have never been the biggest proponent of Tebow 's, as it relates to the NFL. But as for how he got started, it is not as if he was an undrafted free agent who played at some small Division III college and became an overnight sensation. he won the Heisman Trophy on his way to leading the Florida Gators to a pair of national championships. It is not as if he was a nobody before being drafted as a late first pick by the Denver Broncos. <p> As for Kardashian, I have no clue how she got started, and I have even less of an idea of why people still like or follow her now. <p> It is a great American mystery. <p> Hartline blames the media. At least for why Tebow is in the news so often. <p> " That 's you guys The Media, how much you love Tebow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the Jets on Sunday. <p> Hey, he makes at least one valid point. <p> But even I will admit that Tebow and Kardashian are really not that alike. <p> At least in terms of who they are as a person. While I have no respect for Tebow as a starting quarterback in the NFL at all, I do respect him as a person. he is a quality guy. He is just not a starting quarterback. He may be more suited as a tight end of tailback. <p> As for Kardashian, I simply have no respect for her at all. Not in any capacity. <p> Kelley also writes for http : **41;6186;TOOLONG.
