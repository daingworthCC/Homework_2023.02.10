5123941 <p> The grand Mormon Temple on Santa Monica Boulevard in Westwood is a strange off-limits landmark : everyone on the Westside can see it, but you can only explore as a member of the church. The temple opened in 1956 ; it 's 190,614 square feet on 13 acres and is topped quite noticeably with a 16 and a half foot tall gold statue of the angel Moroni. It 's all off-limits, except... T magazine noticed that the temple opened a visitors ' center a little over a year ago and decided to take a look. Here 's what they found : <p> -- " Unlike that of the temple, the architecture of the visitors ' center itself is strangely curved and best described as Long Beach aquarium-like. " <p> -- At the front of the center, there 's a landscaped entryway with three " black naturalistic sculptures that edge the garden " ; all the sculptures have plaques inscribed with quotations. The sculptures are " Woman Learning "( a woman in a long skirt with a book), " Playful Moments "( a woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joseph and Emma Smith "( the church 's founder and his wife). <p> -- " Even the long drive to the parking lot behind the temple, up a big hill into an oasis of calm and serenity, was a little awe inspiring. " <p> -- The interior is covered in flat screens and " interactive, hands-on, museumlike, elaborately produced photographs and films. " One TV during the visit shows " images of the interior rooms of the temple, the sealing room, the baptismal bath, which is called a ' font, ' surprisingly primitive art-like, in the American sense of the word, as it rests on 12 carved oxen, which represent the 12 tribes of Israel. " <p> -- There 's also " an extremely impressive( maybe 22 feet high) statue of Jesus as you enter, palms up, replete with visible holes from the cross and, behind it, a modern scrim version of the heavens. " <p> -- Through " a catacomb-like hallway, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookshelves holding fake Dead Sea scrolls and " across a huge wall, an interactive screen entitled ' Where Jesus Walked, ' which in its screen-saver mode is a panoramic view stretching from the site of The Mount of Olives in Jerusalem to what Elder Grover tells me is a reproduction of King Herod 's Temple, explaining that it was originally King Solomon 's Temple but was rebuilt by King Herod after being destroyed. " <p> -- The panorama, however, " starts to change from day to night, replete with an extraordinary moment : as the bright red sun sets behind Jerusalem, fires appear in two of the doorways( or windows?) of the temple
