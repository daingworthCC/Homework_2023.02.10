5111141 <h> Teamsters : On the Ground, Cleaning Up After Sandy <p> Unions are about standing together and taking care of each other -- and since Hurricane Sandy took aim at the Eastern Seaboard two weeks ago, that 's exactly what the Teamsters have been doing, 24/7. You can read about their hard work on their blog. Here are some of the highlights : <p> Monday, October 29 th : " Department of Sanitation Teamsters battened down New York City before the storm hit, driving convoys of trucks to staging areas around the city and emptying and turning over garbage bins. They continued to collect trash and recycling during the storm today, and they 'll be on 12-hour shifts tomorrow to clean up debris. " <p> Tuesday, October 30 th : " New York City Sanitation Department Teamsters from Local 831 are working long hours today removing trees from roadways, breaking apart limbs and cleaning streets as Hurricane Sandy moves on. The monster storm crippled the city, flooding the subways and the Wall Street District and downing power lines. Hundreds of thousands of people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks " on the Local 's Facebook page : " God bless all the people who are working to make our lives better after such a horrible storm. " <p> Fires were still burning ; entire neighborhoods were buried under sand and seawater ; millions were without power ; and then 29 inches of snow fell. " None of that stopped our brothers and sisters from getting ' er done at departments of public works and sanitation, the railroads and UPS. " <p> " You can make a donation to the Red Cross by texting ' redcross ' to 90999 and you will make a $10 donation. Tom Petillo, president of Teamsters Local 125 in Trenton, NJ, is working with the IBT, Joint Council 73 and other New Jersey unions to coordinate rescue and relief efforts. He asks members to donate food, water and clothing. " <p> From a Teamsters member in Rockaway, Queens : " Bring shovels, gloves and give us a hand. Do n't matter which block, just walk up and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teamsters sanitation and DPW members are working long, exhausting hours to get the New York region back on its feet. Many lost their homes, some lost children and a few are in the hospital with injuries. And yet they 're clearing away debris, handing out food and removing downed trees. " <p> " Department of Sanitation New York supervisor texted that sanitation workers are sleeping in the garages : ' Everyone seems better than one would expect. Some have lost everything. Hot food has been scarce, and the workers are being fed military MREs. Brother Michael Lewery 's home on Staten Island was damaged, but he went to work anyway. He ended up in the hospital after he was electrocuted. ' " <p> Thursday, November 8 th : " We delivered a truck of water and clothing donated by our members to storm-damaged Long Beach. We went to the Martin Luther King center that, in normal times, serves as a community center and day care facility. The director of the center told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them or help them yet. This center is now serving as an emergency shelter for the community and they were in dire need of assistance. With a nor'easter coming in, they have no heat and the building had drafts and leaks that needed attention. We saw the genuine gratitude from these folks, who truly needed help. It was a proud day to be a Teamster. " <p> Friday, November 9 th : " The call just went out : The Red Cross desperately needs 400 drivers tonight, tomorrow and Sunday to bring relief supplies to hurricane victims in the New York region. " <p> Saturday, November 10 th : " Teamsters are answering the Red Cross 's call to help distribute clean-up kits and supplies to victims of Hurricane Sandy. We 're getting photos of Teamsters packing and loading supplies in New Jersey warehouses. They 're also driving trucks and forklifts and shuttling volunteers all over the New York region. This is a 24/7 operation. UPS Teamsters were out in force, doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Gillespie tells us the Teamsters are renting buses from Teamster employer Jofaz Busing, and Teamsters from Local 854 are driving them to help with the bulk distribution. At noon today, a convoy of 12 trucks driven by Teamsters drove from the warehouse to hard-hit Rockaway. Another convoy of five trucks driven by Teamsters carried supplies to Staten Island. " <p> Sunday, November 11 th : " Red Cross warehouses, staging areas and distribution hubs are alive with more than 300 Teamsters and their families today. They 're all pitching in to get desperately needed supplies to victims of Superstorm Sandy in the New York region. " <p> " The news media is ignoring the extent of the damage, but it 's bad. At least 40,000 people in New York alone are homeless. In Jersey City Teamsters are helping bag, load and deliver clean-up kits : Large mesh bags that each contain a blanket, work gloves, garden-size trash bags, flashlight and batteries, baby wipes, hand sanitizer and hand and toe warmers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse. Some brought their spouses and children. The Teamsters rented buses to help move volunteers to staging areas and Teamsters are driving them. We 've been hearing our experience in logistics( not to mention hard work) has been invaluable.
