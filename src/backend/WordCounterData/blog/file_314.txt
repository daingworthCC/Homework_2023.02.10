I am pleased to see this occasion return to the importance of bygone days when thousands gathered at Edmonds Field for this traditional May crowning. This is truly a day for rejoicing. <p> The theme of this year 's event, Mary -- Sign of Hope, is a reminder that in this time of many challenges, Mary can ably guide us along the way to greater spiritual development. Mary is the first and foremost disciple of Christ, and it was she who first presented Jesus to the world. Today, too, Mary can lead us to Jesus and help us more and more to be his true disciples. May we keep our hearts and minds ever open to receive the Lord in faith, as we gather around Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peoples, you who know peoples sufferings and their hopes, you who have a mother 's awareness of all the struggles between good and evil, between light and darkness, which affect the modern world, accept the cry which we, moved by the Holy Spirit, address directly to your heart. Embrace, with the love of the Mother and Handmaid of the Lord, this human world of ours, this State of California, our diocese, our parishes, our families, and all our brothers and sisters. We entrust and consecrate them to you, for we are full of concern for both the elderly and the eternal destiny of everyone. <p> In a special way, we entrust and consecrate to you those individuals and nations which particularly need to be entrusted and consecrated. " We have recourse to your protection, holy Mother of God " ; despise not our petitions in our necessities. <p> Behold, as we come before you, Mother of Christ, before your Immaculate Heart, we desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the consecration which, for love of us, your Son made of Himself to the Father : " For their sake, " he said, " I consecrate myself that they may be consecrated in the truth "( Jn 17:19). We wish to unite ourselves with our Redeemer in this, His consecration for the world and for the human race, which, in His Divine Heart, has the power to obtain pardon and to secure reparation. <p> Above all creatures, Mary, may you be blessed, you, the Handmaid of the Lord, who, in the fullest way, obeyed the divine call! Hail to you who are wholly united to the redeeming consecration of your Son! Mother of the Church, enlighten the people of God along the paths of faith, hope and love! Help us to live in the truth of the consecration of Christ for the entire modern world. <p> Immaculate Heart, help us to conquer the menace of evil, which so easily takes root in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects already weigh down upon our modern world and seem to block the paths toward the future. <p> From famine and war, deliver us. From nuclear war, from incalculable self-destruction, from every kind of war, deliver us. From sins against human life from its very beginning to natural death, deliver us. <p> From hatred and from the demeaning of the dignity of the children of God, deliver us. From every injustice in the life of society, both national and international, deliver us. From readiness to trample on the commandments of God, deliver us. <p> From attempts to stifle in human hearts the very truth of God, deliver us.
