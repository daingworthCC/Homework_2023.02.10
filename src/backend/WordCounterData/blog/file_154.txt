Scientists are now wondering if phosphorous has been leaking from dredged sediments that were dumped onto the bottom of Lake Erie. Their theory comes on the heels of a Vermont study which revealed that eroded creek bed sediments delivered much more phosphorus to Lake Champlain than scientists had previously thought. Consequently, the International Joint Commission has asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to start collecting data from the Lake 's dump sites so that scientists can test their theory. <p> Viewer Tip : Even though scientists ca n't yet say how much phosphorus is leaking from those sediments, they know it has n't outweighed the influence of fertilizers on algal blooms. If most of Lake Erie 's phosphorus came from those sediments, then this year 's heat should have produced a record algae season. Instead, it was mild because there has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertilizers lying on its surrounding farmland. <p> For years, scientists have shown that the phosphorus feeding Lake Erie 's algae blooms largely comes from excess fertilizers, but is another source lurking beneath Lake Erie 's waves?
