5125241 <p> One of the headlines this week from the IEA Report suggests that the United States will be the top global oil producer in five years. Yet back in DeSoto Parish in Louisiana, where the Haynesville Shale discovery in 2008 started the bonanza, revenues are now falling and school board budgets are strapped as the end of the glory days are beginning to appear. <p> Just this week Aubrey McClendon said that Chesapeake 's prospects for oil in Ohio, where Chesapeake had high hopes for the Utica Shale, are now dim. It is easy to look at one of the large maps showing all the shale deposits in the United States that the Oil and Gas Journal include in their print editions, and to be carried away( as the IEA apparently are) with the vast acreage that is shaded on the map. Unfortunately, as we can see, reality tells another story. The size of the resources have been measured in the past, and with the best plays being given preference, the recognition of decline rates and unprofitable wells have not yet been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw. <p> It seems unrealistic to anticipate the levels now being projected for future North American production of oil. Nevertheless, these projections do tend to crowd conflicting stories on the subject out of the spotlight. Further, if the predictions for American production gains, even in the short term, turn out to be optimistic, then the impacts may be even more exaggerated than is currently appreciated. Consider that OPEC now expects that North America will continue to provide the greatest y-o-y increase in supply over other nations, and there are in fact, few other nations that will contribute much more in the next year. <p> Figure 2. Non-OPEC supply growth expressed as a year on year change.( OPEC November MOMR) <p> The MOMR notes that UK oil production has fallen below 1 mbd for the first time since 1977, while Norway 's production has fallen to levels not seen since 1990. These numbers are part of an overall revision of non-OPEC production for 2013, which OPEC now sees as coming in, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production continues to decline by around 47 kbd from September to October. Yet other sources are now reporting that both China and South Korea may have been helping Iran increase oil exports. As a result, production may have increased 70 kbd instead of declining, though the overall volume remains at around 2.7 mbd, of which exports rose from 1 mbd to 1.43 mbd. <p> When the " as reported directly " table is compared, Iran is shown to be still producing at around 3.7 mbd. <p> Figure 5. OPEC production based on direct communication with the producing country( OPEC November MOMR). <p> Within Iran, the government has partially reduced the subsidies that it was providing for gasoline, which initially reduced demand by about 50 tb/d, and flattened internal demand. But as we enter the colder months, OPEC is estimating that demand will again start to rise. <p> Concurrently, Turkmenistan has stopped exporting natural gas to Iran. Normally Iran would increase imports over the winter months to around 1 billion cu.ft/day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographic reasons, and Iran has, in the past, exported about 80% of the equivalent volume to Turkey. Iran has apparently suggested that Turkmenistan increase the delivery to 1.4 bcf/d, but since Turkmenistan can now get a good price for its gas from China, there is more of a debate this year over price, without agreement at the moment. Iran also swaps around 35 mcf/d of natural gas with Armenia in return for electric power. <p> As a way to try and work around the current sanctions, Iran has been changing to a scenario where it can move more of its oil using its own tankers. The country had been storing millions of barrels in part of this fleet, but that volume is being sold so that the vessels can, instead, haul oil. And there is the possibility that the insurance on these vessels has been " fiddled " to get around the burden imposed by sanctions. <p> Although the government maintains that the official inflation rate is 25 percent... with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In addition, unemployment has soared, with estimates stating that between 500,000 and 800,000 Iranians have lost their jobs... " Business is drying up, industry is collapsing. There 's zero investment, " said an Iranian businessman in September... the government has attempted to shield the lower classes by offering them cash handouts and subsidizing certain imported staple goods, making them relatively affordable for poorer segments of the population. But even these efforts have had a limited effect, as the price of goods such as Barbari bread went from 1,000 rials to 5,000 rials last week. <p> There are even suggestions that the economy could " essentially explode " by next spring. On the other hand there are ways of getting around sanctions, and these may allow the crisis to continue to simmer for some time. <p> All this would suggest that exports of Iranian oil will not be easily available for some time, although with a new regime in China their commitment to maintaining current levels of trade is now unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kbd in Quanzhou that is scheduled to start next June, and one for 300 kbd that is to be located in Zhanjiang, with oil for the latter anticipated to come from Kuwait. Nevertheless, it may be that China, which is currently taking about half the Iranian exports might find it possible to accommodate more. <p> " Yes, this coal and gas and oil is still technically in the soil. But it 's already economically aboveground -- it 's figured into share prices, companies are borrowing money against it, nations are basing their budgets on the presumed returns from their patrimony. It explains why the big fossil-fuel companies have fought so hard to prevent the regulation of carbon dioxide -- those reserves are their primary asset, the holding that gives their companies their value. " <p> Saying over and over again that there is this huge reserve available... makes it " real "... real enough to move money around and raise the value of wasteland... real enough to set-up the marks. <p> K - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been making a good living for over 100 years. I still conteend the most profitable player in the Eagle Ford was Petrohawk that sold their undrilled acreage for $12 billion and walked a way with a big smile on their faces. If you have n't seen me offer the promoters creed : Roll into town with the first wagon load of whores and roll out before the first wagon load of production equipment arrives. <p> That map from the OIl &; Gas Journal is quite deceiving. Several wells have been drilled in Michigan where the map shows dark shaded area for good hydrocarbon potential. As I recall these half dozen wells in MI did not produce any economically recoverable gas or oil. Same in Ohio, but for oil not one producing well, although some have produced measurable amounts of gas, but maybe not economical at todays prices. <p> mb - True : there has n't been a shale formation in every basin in the US that has n't been tested if but to a minor degree. No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these shale and may never. But all the shale players are looking at every shale again. One of the latest reinventions was the Marine Tuscaloosa Shale north of Nawlins. Have heard that after some initial excite its turn out to be a disappointment. I 've heard similar rumors about the Utica in Ohio but not much hard data. <p> The shales will live on IMHO despite some disappointments. The pubcos have no choice due to the lack of conventional prospects. They either chase the shales or liquidate and disappear. Hey have no other option IMHO. <p> mb - True : there has n't been a shale formation in every basin in the US that has n't been tested if but to a minor degree.

Hey have no other option IMHO. <p> Look at the O &GJ; map of the undeveloped shale basins, covering all of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta to the edge of the map. **44;4406;TOOLONG I have a nice bridge in Brooklyn for sale, only one owner, very well maintained... <p> I think your geography of Canada is a little off. The shale basin map shown in the article covers a little part of the SW part of Manitoba, a small part of southern Saskatchewan and a little bit of SE Alberta. <p> There has to be large shale basins in these provinces because they contain conventional oil deposits and the source rock for these deposits are marine shales. No shale basins to act as kitchens for the oil and there will be no conventional deposits. So if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin somewhere. Whether than shale is going to be hydrocarbon productive today is an open question. <p> The grey colored region is the huge Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which is underlaid by shale, the darker blue region extending north from North Dakota and Montana into southern Saskatchewn, southwestern Manitoba, and southeastern Alberta is the Canadian portion of the Bakken formation. <p> The Bakken does extend into Canada, but does n't get as much play in the press as the US portion - the Canadian oil sands are much, much bigger than the Bakken. The blue areas in NE BC are similar shaley formations which are starting to be developed now. There are other potentially productive shaley formations in Alberta, but they are only recently starting to be analyzed. <p> My good heavens. You are confusing North American production with USA production. The graphical information posted shows NA production growing by 0.45 BOPD. This is pretty realistic. You seem to thinking that this is solely the result of shale oil. Not true, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest exporter of energy to the USA and is projected to be producing over 6 million BOPD in the next decade or so from the present 3.1 million BOPD. The emerging Canol Shale play in the NWT of Canada is potentially an elephant of world proportions. The supermajors have agreed to committed to spend $620 million in return for being granted the petroleum rights by the Canadian Federal Government. <p> There also seem to be a focus on the lower 48 shale oil reserves. I do n't know how the Alaskan play will work out, but it is the source for the Prudhoe field and if it works out as Great Bear Petroleum is projecting it will make a material difference to the USA production. It will easily fulfilling the IEA project that the USA will ramp up its oil production. Now I am pretty skeptical of the Great Bears hype, but you have not even considered the possibility. <p> I think the IEA bottom line on NA is that if NA can import less liquid fuels then perhaps it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA will not have to keep a fleet in the Persian Gulf and perhaps some other country can worry about the security of oil routes. Then the USA can keep its blood and treasure at home. I think this would be a good thing for Canadians and Americans. Let 's hope that at least some of the hype and greed of the oil companies can serve a noble purpose. <p> In short, NA is NOT the just the lower 48. Things like the Utica are small potatoes. Do n't conflate the lower 48 and NA as it leads to considerable confusion. <p> Now I am pretty skeptical of the Great Bears hype, but you have not even considered the possibility <p> They certainly toned down after the initial presentation. That one was intended to get attention and it did. I happened into a presentation by Great Bear 's CEO in September. The assembled were privy to the first public display of a photo--taken the night before--of a Shublik formation core break--shiny, black and highly fossiliferous. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two exploratory wells had turned up--it met modeled expectations--but full analysis had not yet begun. <p> All said, a lot of the projected US production numbers I see put Alaska 's contribution moving to 2mbd in the next few/several years. Great Bear 's ' full development ' scenario( which assumes the numbers pan) has them drilling up to 192 wells a year from 24 pads( for a bit of comparison in the neighborhood of 1200 production wells have been drilled in the Prudhoe neighborhood since 1977)... one long skinny road to facilitate this... Great Bear has already grabbed the most promising leases with best access to that one road in and the one pipe out( TAPS). <p> Right now North Slope production is in steady decline( TAPS delivery averaged 540kbd this year through October). Even if Great Bear were able to get to the full development phase by 2015( that requires a whole lot of things to go right) their projected oil production wo n't climb to 200kbd until about 2020. About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of that 2mbd to come from. <p> Shell finally sunk some bits below the Beaufort and Chukchi this summer but due to issues with the containment barge they pulled out of all holes before reaching the hydrocarbon depth. And even though this year had the smallest arctic ice pack recorded since satellite recording began in 1979, a persistent ' island ' --with an area of a mid sized US state--made up of about 30% ice concentration hung around neighborhood for a long time and shooed Shell off some sites for a while. <p> What I 'm saying is nothing out there indicates AK can ramp up production all that fast in the next few/several years even if all does go well. <p> If Desoto was funded by Haynesville gas, the current revenue downturn is likely due to the drop in prices from the gas glut as any depletion. <p> I do n't know the Haynesville well, but I hear those rigs have shifted from gas there to oil prospects in other areas, including the nearby Cotton Valley. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include " at what price? ". For sure there is a lot more gas available if prices go to $12. For now, the game is oil, hence slowing in the Marcellus, Haynesville, and others. Utica has ribbons of oil, as does the Eagle Ford. Limestone plays seem to as well. <p> Personally, I suspect the truth will be in the middle ; considerably more reserves than some here would expect, considerable less than the IEA states( and therefore at a much higher price as well). <p> Chart shows the split between crude oil and condensates( green columns) for the years 2002 and as of 2011 based upon data from EIA and National Board of Energy( NEB) in Canada. So far there was a high in conventional C + C in 2005. <p> Chart illustrates that growth in world( C + C definitely do not give them any personal information or send them money.
