5200441 <p> I do n't have a tag for " bad grounds for a GAO bid protest, " but if I did, challenging an agency 's decision not to conduct discussions would fall in that category -- at least( as is typically the case), when the solicitation does not state that discussions will be conducted. <p> This issue comes up often enough in GAO bid protest decisions( with the same predictable result nearly every time) that it 's worth taking a quick look at one such recent case in which this particular issue arose. <p> Each program attendee will receive an autographed copy of my book, The Small-Business Guide to Government Contracts.( If you already have a copy, here 's your chance to pick up gift for that special government contractor in your life). The program will offer lots of important information on federal mentor-protege programs and invaluable networking opportunities -- you do n't want to miss it. <p> If you are a government contractor in the Midwest, you owe it to yourself to attend a MAGIC event and see what this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the March 2013 mentor-protege event, click over to the event 's page on the MAGIC website. <p> If your high school teacher or college professor had asked you to compose an essay up to five pages in length, would you expect an " A " for writing a single paragraph? <p> Probably not, and the same principle applies when it comes to proposals. In a recent GAO bid protest decision, the agency gave contractors up to five pages to describe each past performance reference. Not surprisingly, the GAO held that it was reasonable for the procuring agency to downgrade an offeror 's past performance score when that offeror only provided a one-paragraph write-up of each project. <p> Contractors filed 2,475 GAO bid protests in Fiscal Year 2012, a five percent increase from the prior year, according to the GAO 's annual bid protest report to Congress. The GAO 's annual report indicated that " sustain " decisions were up slightly from the prior year, while the overall " effectiveness rate " of protests -- a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 42%. <p> Meanwhile, the VA was the only procuring agency to ignore GAO recommendations -- something the VA did repeatedly in the Aldevra line of cases. <p> If you click the " service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses " tab on the right, you will find a list of SmallGovCon blog posts on CVE verification, affiliation, joint ventures, and the like. And do n't let me stop you from reading ; this is a legal blog, after all. <p> But before you scroll through the latest SBA OHA or GAO decision, take a moment to think about that phrase, which can be tossed around rather casually in the industry these days : " service-disabled veteran. " Let 's not lose sight of the fact that, whether or not you are a veteran, the service-disabled veteran-owned small business program is worthy of our support because it is one small but important way for our country to say " thank you " to those who risked so much, and gave so much, on behalf of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the least understood SBA affiliation rules, and continues to trip up many small government contractors. Case in point : a recent SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals decision finding a small business affiliated with a company controlled by the mother of the small business 's owner, based on the family relationship and subcontracts between the companies. <p> The SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals will reject a contractor 's attempt to submit new evidence in a SBA size appeal unless the contractor shows " good cause " to admit the new evidence. <p> And, as demonstrated by a recent SBA OHA size appeal decision, when the evidence was publicly available at the time the size protest was filed, but was not submitted with the size protest, it will be very difficult to convince SBA OHA to review the new evidence. <p> This blog is for educational purposes only.
