Trying to smartly budget a fabulous trip is like herding cats. There 's just so much that goes into planning a holiday -- airfare, accommodations, attractions, etc. As a seasoned traveler, something that strikes fear into my heart is a rodent infested hotel room.( Take a look at this video of a revolting Comfort Inn in Atlanta, GA to catch my drift.) A hotel room that is so decrepit and appalling that its reminiscent of the London pigsty Clark Griswold and his family vacated in National Lampoon 's European Vacation sends me running for the reception desk. <p> The National Lampoon series may have been a little less eventful had Clark taken advantage of sites like TravellersPoint. It 's always a good idea to know what you 're getting yourself into when traveling abroad. Let 's keep in mind the Griswolds inadvertently knocked over the rock pillars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lambeth Bridge roundabout. A little prior research could have helped out, Mr. Griswold. <p> Arguably, a goal in traveling the world is to experience other cultures and make connections with other people. TravellersPoint brings travelers from all across the globe together. Why? For a myriad of reasons from sharing love for our wonderful to tips on getting airline upgrades. It promotes discussion among members to encourage worldliness. Members can share photos of some of the amazing sites they have taken in, and they can recommend where to get your morning caffeine fix. <p> TravellersPoint is a great resource if you are looking to take a trip but have no one to go with. As creepy as it may sound, there are strangers out there who will gladly travel the world with you. Take a look at this recent post asking for companions for a ten month European/Southeast Asian backpacking trip : <p> To sum TravellersPoint up, it really just asks you : where do you want to go? A simple search from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers about their journeys, hotel accommodations, and attractions. With over 50,000 booking accommodations readily available and over 30,000 published blogs, there is a wealth of knowledge to be shared by this site. <p> No one wants to wake up in the morning with a rat on their pillow. Next time you 're traveling abroad, consider consulting your fellow travelers to get the what 's really deserving of four stars. <h> Share this : <h> Like this : <h> 2 thoughts on " Where do you want to go? " <p> This seems suspicious, does the site have any safety/security precautions? It just seems very easy for some one to abuse the system. Much like a online dating site where people can make fake profiles. The same thing may happen on this site, except, instead of say, online chatting and 1 date/face to face meeting, once you get on the airplane to another country your effectively stuck there for a long period of time. <p> That 's an awfully cynical outlook on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose if someone really was of malicious intent, they could persuade someone to go somewhere they really should not go. It would be difficult though. The site is composed of 30,000+ blogs, so finding one person 's write-up would essentially be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
