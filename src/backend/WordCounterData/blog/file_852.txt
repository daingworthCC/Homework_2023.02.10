5194141 <h> France and Britain Weigh the Price of Nuclear Deterrence <p> Frank Franklin Ii/The Associated Press The U.N. General Assembly in session on Wednesday. <p> LONDON -- There were reports on Thursday of stirrings within the British military about the need to scale back the country 's nuclear deterrent in order to spend the money on confronting more conventional threats. <p> It is part of a continuing debate in Britain and France -- Europe 's two nuclear weapons powers -- about the cost to their overburdened budgets of maintaining nuclear independence. <p> In the post-Cold War world, does it make sense to have nuclear capacities that were designed to deter the Soviet Union? <p> From a diplomatic viewpoint, nuclear weapons are seen as money well spent, allowing both countries to punch above their weight in the international arena. However, economic factors mean the two countries would now like to keep the weapons but cut costs in a process that has been described as " deterrent lite. " <p> Although Britain and France have fallen to the status of second-tier powers, they are still among the big five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the United States, Russia and China. That authority stems in part from the fact that both maintain independent nuclear deterrents. <p> As world leaders gathered at the United Nations this week for the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly, the supremacy of the big five, a legacy of World War II, was once more under attack as a global anachronism. <p> President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, playing to the non-aligned gallery, told the Assembly : " The existence of the right of veto and the monopoly of power by the Security Council has led to the restriction of the exercise of rights by, and the protection of the rights of nations. " <p> That is an argument that might be dismissed if it were confined to the leader of a country that is under pressure from the big five to come clean about its own nuclear ambitions. However, it is one widely shared within the 193-member U.N., where reform of the Security Council has been on the agenda for almost 20 years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil, Germany and Japan called for a bigger effort to reorganize the UN with a view to giving major developing countries permanent seats on the 15-member Security Council " in order to better reflect today 's geopolitical realities. " <p> President Jacob Zuma of South Africa used his U.N. speech to call for a more democratic Security Council and more seats and greater representation for Africa. <p> " Given its mandate, the Council has to be legitimate, democratic and transparent. Its current composition has a propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the face of crisis, " President Zuma said. <p> Any fundamental shake-up of the Security Council would make the permanent seats held by France and Britain vulnerable, providing both with a strong motive to maintain their nuclear forces. <p> An unidentified senior British general quoted by The Independent made the connection. " There are all kinds of considerations beyond purely military ones, " he said, " such as whether not having a nuclear deterrent would have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is broad cross-party support in both countries for keeping nuclear weapons despite the need to curb defense costs. <p> Michel Rocard, a former French Socialist prime minister, was widely criticized this year for suggesting France should abandon its independent deterrent, saying the money spent on maintaining it " serves absolutely no purpose. " <p> The latest debate in Britain was spurred by remarks from Sir Nick Harvey, a Liberal Democratic former defense minister in the Conservative-led coalition government. He was dropped this month from a post that included reviewing Britain 's nuclear capability. <p> He said senior military commanders had expressed reservations about the costs and benefits of maintaining the country 's current level of nuclear deterrence after the country 's aging fleet of nuclear-armed Trident submarines is scrapped. <p> Sir Nick told members of his party that there were opportunities to scale back the level of the deterrent without actually scrapping it. <p> He said Britain had the technology to " simply put it away in a cupboard and keep it as a contingency in case there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might need the U.K. government
