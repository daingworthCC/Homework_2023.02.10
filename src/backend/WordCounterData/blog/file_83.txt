5116341 <p> As fact checkers busily highlight the myriad number of lies and distortions offered by Mitt- Etch-A-Sketch -Romney during last night 's debate, and the spinners spin their polls with impunity, I find it interesting that the debate tactic itself has not yet been discussed nor properly analyzed. In fact, the lies and distortions offered by Romney in last night 's debate are the very ESSENCE of his tactic -- and is therefore quite pertinent to the discussion. Romney used a debate tactic known as the Gish Gallop. <p> Named for the debate tactic created by creationist shill Duane Gish, a Gish Gallop involves spewing so much bullshit in such a short span on that your opponent ca n't address let alone counter all of it. To make matters worse a Gish Gallop will often have one or more ' talking points ' that has a tiny core of truth to it, making the person rebutting it spend even more time debunking it in order to explain that, yes, it 's not totally false but the Galloper is **30;1343;TOOLONG the actual situation. A true Gish Gallop generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical content of the Gish Gallop is pure bullshit and anybody knowledgeable and informed on the subject would recognize it as such almost instantly. That is, the Gish Gallop is designed to appeal to and deceive precisely those sorts of people who are most in need of honest factual education. <p> 2) The points are all ones that the Galloper either knows, or damn well should know, are totally bullshit. With the slimier users of the Gish Gallop, like Gish himself, its a near certainty that the points are chosen not just because the Galloper knows that they 're bullshit, but because the Galloper is deliberately trying to shovel as much bullshit into as small a space as possible in order to overwhelm his opponent with sheer volume and bamboozle any audience members with a facade of scholarly acumen and factual knowledge. <p> It is quite apparent to those of us who have closely followed this election, that this latest sketch drawn out by Romney completely contradicts major policy ideas stumped on the campaign trail by him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate the substance( or lack thereof) of Romney ' ' s policy ideas, it threw Obama off his game. We have seen Romney do this before in the primaries. Obama needs to be prepared for it in future debates. Call it Etch-A-Sketch, call it the Gish Gallop, call it lies... it 's all about the same. But it is a known debate tactic. And, like Romney, it is dishonest. <p> ON EDIT : Top of the rec list! Wow! Thanks! Just FYI, in the intro, I provided a hyperlink to the wiki explanation of the Gish Gallop, just in case you are looking for more information on it. <p> On a happier note, please allow me to share this joke floating around the internet today : <p> Snow White, Superman and Pinocchio are walking along. <p> They see a sign : " Contest for World 's Most Beautiful Woman. " Snow White goes in, later comes out smiling, wearing a crown. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for World 's Strongest Man. " Superman goes in, later comes out smiling, wearing the belt. <p> They walk along and see a sign : " Contest for World 's Greatest Liar. " Pinocchio goes in from " education ". A tag like " reform " alone is probably not meaningful. <p> The gallop is often used as an indirect argument from authority, as it appears to paint the " galloper " as an expert in a broad range of subjects and the opponent as an incompetent bumbler who did n't do their homework before the debate. Such emphasis on style over substance is the reason many scientists disdain public debates as a forum for disseminating opinions. <p> and as fast as they can spew the words out. Watch for it the next time you see it. And it 's always the RWrs who use it. <p> The other technique is to spew the BS fast and then make an end statement that 's so outrageous and in need of a response that it ' s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupts to do the same thing again - always ending with an outrageous statement. What that technique does is that it steers the response into one small area leaving the rest of the BS on the table without response( and therefore assumed to be true). <p> These guys need these kind of horrific. <p> There already is class warfare in America. Unfortunately, the rich are winning. <p> SNIPPET :..... Common Cause, written by Tom Crompton of the environment group WWF, examines a series of fascinating recent advances in the field of psychology. It offers, I believe, a remedy to the blight that now afflicts every good cause from welfare to climate change. <p> Progressives, he shows, have been suckers for a myth of human cognition he labels the enlightenment model. This holds that people make rational decisions by assessing facts. All that has to be done to persuade people is to lay out the data : they will then use it to decide which options best support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments demonstrate that it does n't work like this. Instead of performing a rational cost-benefit analysis, we accept information that confirms our identity and values, and reject information that conflicts with them. We mould our thinking around our social identity, protecting it from serious challenge. Confronting people with inconvenient facts is likely only to harden their resistance to change. <p> However, I think that it 's only true up to a point. Once the resistance is broken, those people become strong evangelists in the other direction. For a simple example - look at ex-smokers who become anti-smoking evangelists. <p> Once " the scales fall from their eyes, " there is no stopping them - the fury at being betrayed and bamboozled is an amazing fuel source for advocacy in the other direction. I 'm beginning to see it in some newly-former republican friends and some former climate deniers. <p> While the other side thinks they 're winning, the information is out there, churning away, and as the planet continues to misbehave, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama said forthrightly " I am the ONLY one on this stage who cares about you, who cares about this country, who cares about your children. I will protect you( and have done my best to protect you) from the ravages of those who never cease looking for ways to spend your tax dollars in schemes that enrich themselves. They never cease creating schemes to take your retirement monies away from you. They are predators like that Chinese company that gave us poison to put in our cat and dog food so that they could give a product that was cheap and they could make good profits from it. They are predators that send lobbyists to congress to get the most from every bill that is passed not for you but for their corporations. <p> I stand in front of you and protect you and your family from predators like these. <p> How? Try this : 1% ' I 'm not going to cut taxes for the rich. " Bo should have said : " Mitt, come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest with the American people. " <p> Or this : 1% ' I 'm going to fire PBS b/c not borrow Chinese $ " BO should have said : ' But you 'll borrow $5 trillion from China for taxcuts for the 1% who do n't need them. Unless you raise middle class taxes. Come on Mitt, just be honest with the American people. They deserve it. ' <p> Or this : " BO cut Medicare by $718 b " BO should have said : " Oh come on Mitt, benefits went up under my plan. You ca n't raise beneifts if you 're cutting them. And that 's the exact same # the man you picked as your running mate proposed in his budget. Only you give it to insurance companies rather than adding 10 years to the Medicare trust fund. In fact, independent analysts say you 're plan bankrupts Medicare in just 4 years. Talk about cutting benefits for existing reciptents. " <p> None of those were beyond BO. He 's said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have done so to 1% face. The problem is 1% is taking advantage of one of the greater folly politcal handlers have committed : ' never call your opponent a liar ', and the related ' never say anything that might sound like you 're doing that '. This is nonsense when you 're dealing with a liar, who you 've already proved is a liar who says one thing in public and another in private( Hello! 47% tape!). <p> With only 5 preps, Axelrod and P managed to prep BO just enough to fak him up( ' do n't look angry! ') and not enough to win. Just enough to lose. <p> But of course, in the end this one actually is BOs fault. Now he has to prove it was just one bad night. <p> he would have looked like Joe Walsh did to us with his " come on, Obama, quit lying " spiel to the people who have n't been paying attention thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sincerity of the speaker. That 's the tough part about it. <p> Honestly, I ca n't say I like what Obama did. He should have at the very least been looking into the camera and addressing us with his answers and like he was paying attention when Romney spoke. <p> nt in everyone 's mind atm, so he would not even have to explicitly reference it- the media would have done it for him. Indeed, since 1% would have likely used that for his primed etch-a-sketch on it, 1% himself would have reminded voters of it( in order to then try and rebut it). <p> I mean seriously-- it 's like the beginning of Obama 's term all over again. Giving the Republicans the benefit of the doubt as though they were going to negotiate within some grand tradition of American statesmanship. But the Republicans were out for blood and for Obama 's head. They think nothing of him. They think less than nothing of him. And yet he gives them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents. <p> Well it has to stop. <p> He has to be prepared, in the next debate, to be withering and cold in calling out Romney 's lies. <p> That 's one more thing to add to my long list of small problems. --my son, age 10 <p> When he accused Obama of lying in the debates before they happened. Romney said he would need to choose between refuting the lies and telling his own story - that 's the Gish method. That 's projection and Romney was able to lie at will by accusing Obama of it. Crafty. BO may need to tell where to find the facts during the debate - sometimes on Romney 's own site and tell the audience to go find the facts soon because the Romney camp will wipe the site as soon as it works against them. He has to look Romney in the eye and get him off his prepared script. Kennedy 's line may also work - you are more democrat than I am with your latest positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean what you say. He needs to say to Romney 's face what we all know - Romney 's position will change depending on what crowd he is addressing. <p> Debating is not his strong suite so he should have started months ago. At least one a week with that last week before the debates devoted to as much prep as he could afford( no campaign appearances, just prep). <p> practice debates seems unreasonable. Still no reason they could not have done far more partials, say 30 minute section. I used to coach debate, and while I understand the natural resistance to it, I think POTUS would have been better served by no practice ebates rather than so few. At least he would have preserved spontaneity, if nothing else. <p> you have to study them figure out the the bottom line, essential points keep them on a short leash, keep hammering it back home again and again. you ca n't lose your temper, but you have to keep them contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you can do, in a public situation is feint... enough to let them think they have you and, in their own ego spree to destroy you, they may overstep and expose themselves( figuratively speaking) in a way that is obvious to pretty much everyone. <p> in private life, the best thing to do is get the hell away from someone like that. <p> Mitt Romney is putting up a huge front. it takes effort to keep up that front. we have all seen the cracks in the facade. he would be a horribly incompetent president but he is not a goofy friendly nincompoop. <p> This was, of course, the one thing that Obama could not afford to do in last night 's debate. It would have made him appear hostilely aggressive, dominating rather than dominant, and pedantic. Stopping a tsunami of BS is tough to do unless the moderator steps in, which last night 's format did not afford. <p> I do n't know of any way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when creationists ' debate ', it consists exclusively of this technique, precisely because it is pretty much impossible to counter. <p> People willing to engage in a Gish Gallop are NOT honest people, who are interested in truth. Generally the best way to counter it is to ignore the people willing to do it, because as a person, they have proven themselves dishonest, conniving and a dishonest debater. This is the reason why most scientists have stopped trying to debate creationists at all. <p> Anyone using the Gish Gallop should automatically be discredited by the media. Mitt Romney should be stained for the rest of his life by using this dishonest tactic. <p> I think Christopher Hitchens was one of the few people who could could actually argue against a Gallop, so if you want to see how, watch some of his debates against any creationist. <p> Take a moment, to be the adult( since Lehrer was having an OOBE), look at the camera, smile, and warn those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive each time Romney makes an assertion or flip-flops. <p> Like they do for sporting events, poker tournaments, etc. Two guys talking the background, one giving the play by play : <p> " Oh, look at that new ' fact ' Mitt pulled right out of his ass! " <p> " Get the fire extinguishers out for that one, Mike, that one had both legs soaked in gasoline! " <p> " Ya know Vince, we expected Mitt to be aggressive, being the short stack in this race, but bluffing on the first hand, before the flop, that 's REALLY putting it to Obama. " <p> " You got ta admit, No-Drama Obama is earning his name tonight. The man is so cool in the face of these monstrous bluffs, he 's just going to play his hand and ignore the pantload coming from the other side of the stage. " <p> " Stay tuned to heads-up competition in the 2012 finals, brought to you by Budweiser. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed positions so frequently I 'm surprised, and glad to hear you are for eliminating pre-existing conditions. The only problem is your plan does n't eliminate it for people without insurance ". BOOM. Then move on to your own points. Do n't spend your whole time countering the b.s., call it out with one zinger, then stick to the points you want to make of your own. Watch, the ID they need to vote, and make sure YOU are registered and ready to vote! <p> that Romney expected Obama to attack him on that. i think that was going to be Romneys ' Zinger ' he was going to flop on the 47 % during the debate and try to make Obama look the fool. For whatever reason Obama did n't bite Romney had to go on FOX news the next day and dump his zinger in the garbage can. <p> Notice that the two studies that do suggest Romney 's plan does n't increase the deficit rely on the elimination of all tax deductions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts. <p> There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said " maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging. " But not " mathematically impossible. " <p> So the studies that Romney says support his tax plan themselves assume he 's raising taxes on people making under $200,000 a year. <p> their own homework and should have known what this dirty debate trick is called and outted this tactic. <p> Personally I did n't know what the name of it was, but I sensed method in this near madness. Rmoney not only " Gished " over our POTUS but also Jim Lehrer from the getgo. In another thread I said the Mittster left treadmarks from his boots all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the effect on Warren was similar to the effect on Obama. Thank you AmBushed and admiralh for giving us this information. It explains a whole lot of what happened last night and to Warren a few days ago. The problem is that intelligent, knowledgeable, and decent people like Obama and Warren ca n't keep up with the amount of garbage being spewed by their slimy lying opponents. In the Warren - Brown debate, every time she 'd answer a false accusation made by Brown, he 'd switch to another lie. It keeps the good guys on the defensive and their choice is to either ignore the crap pouring out of the other guy 's mouth( which Obama mainly did) or try to answer the crap thus handing the debate over to their opponents ' choice of topics. I 'm not sure what strategy can undermine this fact-fabrication, but I find what people like Brown and Romney are doing beyond disgusting. But Obama has a brilliant team and maybe they 'll come up with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That all sounds nice in theory, but in the real world... you ca n't cut taxes and keep the same revenue. Just like you ca n't ask your boss for a pay cut then expect the same income. It does n't add up. " <p> " That all sounds nice in theory, but in the real world, you do n't cut your debt by getting a pay cut and going on a spending spree. " <p> " That all sounds nice in theory, but in the real world, if the market was capable of providing affordable insurance to seniors, we never would have had to create Medicare in the first place. " <p> understood that you need to go bare-knuckles to take down the likes of a Romney. And it worked just fine. Failing to go bare knuckles, like Shannon O'Brien, is the loser 's game when ealing with someone like Reversible Mittens. You need to hit him first, hit him fast, hit him hard and keep him down for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated at all. The entire 1994 Kennedy campaign script against Romney is still sitting right there. Rerun the same damn campaign, and Romney will go down just as hard. <p> his " ethnic stereotype "( Fighting Irishman) went WITH it. Obama can not go there because the " ethnic stereotype " of " Angry Black Man " is precisely what he can not afford. What was a WIN for Teddy would be a total LOSE for Obama. And he knows it. <p> pile of b.s. with one or two strong sentences, then get back to your own points you want to move forward. Then the Gish Fillibustering starts to look unhinged. It requires discipline, and some spontaniety. I think next time Obama will have it down. <p> at that moment. Romney just says, you are wrong or that is not true and then repeats the lie. The result is an exchange of true not true. Romney delivers it with a condescending smile, or a pat on the back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies for their ad campaign. If they get the message out, that everytime Romney opens his mouth he tells a lie, it will be much easier for Obama to make a statement like you suggested. <p> probably the only way. Call him out for his tactic of Gish Galloping. Pick a clear example of a lie the gisher told, and spend your time refuting it completely. When he brings up new lies, do n't waste your time on refuting them, but bring up the one you already refuted thoroughly : " what my opponent just said is not true, just like when he said X which I showed is completely false. " The aim is to get him on the defensive about X so he ca n't bring up new lies. <p> that can be an effective technique. Rather than deconstructing the maze of BS that liars use to slow down the opponent, showing the framework and then tearing it down essentially fumigates the debate. Of course, this would require the liar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plowing straight ahead, but at least most listening would see ' behind the curtain '. <p> BTW, expect Lyin ' Ryan to take this tactic up about twenty notches next week. He 's naturally more hyper, and his " wonkiness " is really nothing more than his ability to keep his bullshit at the front of his mind for easy recall. <p> R-Money/R-Ayn, the ENRON Ticket, is not a campaign ; it 's a hostile takeover bid. <p> does to counter Romney 's tactics in the next debate he must look up - it was especially disturbing to see him looking down like he was bored, not engaged, did n't want to be there etc. Just those pictures of him looking down made him seem lethargic. We need an active as well as thoughtful president. <p> he did n't pay enough attention to body language issues when he was preparing. I also hated him nodding his head as if in agreement when Romney was lying through his teeth. He could have at least used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a food pantry on the Cheyenne River Reservation, Okiciyap. " **33;1375;TOOLONG " <p> However, I do think he can use it in a town hall format, but the good thing is that there will be many more moments in a town hall that Romney ca n't plan for. I think it 's highly likely he 'll say something foolish in a town hall format if hit with an unexpected question from someone sharp. And he 's more likely to show his total lack of understanding or caring about others in a town hall format in which he 's required to respond to individuals. Obama will do better than Romney in a town hall format because Obama is a genuinely likable guy and because they 're being asked questions that require a far broader range of knowledge and intelligence than Romney has. <p> Frank Luntz has anything to do with this? It ca n't just be a coincidence that the 2 most high-profile and important candidates the Dems have are both going up against this tactic... And, it would n't surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reps taking over the government in this election who will find themselves in the same predicament... If something was found linking this tactic with an actual " teacher " of it hired by the Reps, Rachel could have a field day with it... <p> " What would you think me if I were capable of seating myself at a table and gorging myself with food and saw about me the children of my fellow beings starving to death. " - Eugene Victor Debs <p> And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it 's completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you 're going to raise taxes by 3,000 dollars to $4,000 on -- on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there. <p> Obama would have had to have given the performance of a lifetime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known that Romney would a) shift so significantly to the center and b) Do so using more lies per minute than anyone believed humanly possible? <p> I think Romney is going to be sorry he played his hand so fully in the first debate. I 'm even more interested to see Debate #2 than I was to see Debate #1. <p> Romney said that five studies show that his tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class. <p> Romney is using the word " studies " generously. Two items on his list are newspaper editorials that can be analytical but are rarely treated as independent research. One article comes from a campaign adviser, a connection that generally suggests a less than independent assessment. That leaves just two reports out Romney 's five. <p> They should have actually looked at the studies, brought out the assumtions behind the happy conclusions( e.g., do they all assume that tax cuts magically create billionaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate is using credible research, which candidate using made-up shit. <p> Every time Romney opened his mouth, I commented loudly on the quantity of bovine excrement spewing from it. " That 's fucking bullshit! " was apparently my phrase of choice. My 8-year-old kept telling me to stop using so many bad words( as he should have). The debate was infuriating. How can one possibly deal with so many lies without calling them out while they are still being told? But that just would n't be civilized, now would it. <p> the rightwing nuts are in Romney 's camp so now he can move back to the center to try and collect more voters. I saw the shift and could not believe that there had been so many changes to his platform. I think he had no choice but his VP mate will swing back to the right which will destroy the move. I can not wait for the VP debates. <p> study -- name the source!

The " Bush tax cuts " are a shorthand for something the Congress did while Bush was President. Ditto for Obamacare. The difference between the tax cuts and the revisions to medical insurance programs is that the former just eliminated some money coming in, while the latter actually set up administrative programs and monitors. One was a give-away and the other a government service. One took a signature on a bill ; the other took setting up and supervising new departments in agencies. One required a decider ; the other called for a manager. Obama has learned how to be a manager ; Willard does n't know shit from shinola. Which is why his campaign finances are in disarray. Willard thinks " management " means encouraging or threatening people to perform. A real manager knows how to allocate and distribute material assets and resources. A real manager deals with real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mitt Romney 's Comfort with Lying The presidential candidate is used to f aith-based certainty that translates as truth even in the face of evidence to the contrary By Justin Frank, M.D. <p> SNIP. But in the Mormon Church, there was a decision to accept authority as true -- whether or not evidence supported it. Hence Joseph Smith, the founder of the faith in 1820, claimed he was illiterate and received the Book of Mormon directly from God. But he could read, and read very well. <p> This unwavering faith is central to Romney 's comfort in deflecting any examples that the press might bring up of his lying. Further, it allows him to repeat lies again and again -- both personally and in political advertising -- because to him they are not lies at all <p> may also be true that the shifted from right to center left positions at a strategically important point, the debates, which means, if he sticks with his new policies, that he can be accused of change but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes from here. THe combination of the gallop and the policy switching may end up being highly potent in this election. Still do n't see how one counters either tactic in a debate or how the debate rules can be reformed to eliminate it. <p> Romney : Wrong on GM. Wrong on bin Laden. Wrong on tax cuts. Wrong on austerity. Wrong on Medicare. Wrong on the 47%. Wrong for America. <p> He knew very well that the Republican budget and Ryan 's authorship of that budget and its having the same exactly $716B in it was well known and he had a carefully rehearsed and planned reply to being called out on it. <p> You could tell ; he was practically begging the President to come back with " Yeah, well, Ryan has the same $716B in his plan... " <p> The President did n't give him the pleasure. And I 'm very convinced it was on purpose( and I 'm NOT a 10th dimensional chess advocate). <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, make him expose himself before the next debate( ugh, sorry, bad mental image), or anything else other than just the one specific thing ; not responding to the $716B in Medicare lie. <p> And they did n't respond because there was a 99% chance that Romney 's team had something nice, sharp, and pithy ready to stab back with, and just refusing to take the bait robbed them of that sound bite. AND no doubt frustrated Romney during the debate. <p> He kept saying that number, kept repeating that lie. It 's not JUST because the lie is working for them( though that 's part of it). <p> It was egregious how often he was bringing it up. So I figure he was damn near begging the President to fight back on it using the predictable " Ryan budget does the same thing " line. <p> at least back then.

I just posted a link to this diary in which I quoted this as intro : <p> " Named for the debate tactic created by creationist shill Duane Gish, a Gish Gallop involves spewing so much bullshit in such a short span that your opponent ca n't address let alone counter all of it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more ' talking points ' that has a tiny core of truth to it, making the person rebutting it spend even more time debunking it in order to explain that, yes, it 's not totally false but the Galloper is **30;1410;TOOLONG the actual situation. " <p> Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, has dubbed this approach the " Gish Gallop, " describing it as " where the creationist is allowed to run on for 45 minutes or an hour, spewing forth torrents of error that the evolutionist has n't a prayer of refuting in the format of a debate " and criticized Gish for failing to answer objections raised by his opponents. The phrase " Gish Gallop " has come to be used as a pejorative to describe similar debate styles employed by proponents of other, usually fringe beliefs, such as homeopathy or the moon landing hoax. Link <p> The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right. -- Judge Learned Hand, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking via Current TV. The point is that, social media will fact check the debates if the MSM does not, thus driving the MSM to acts of responsible journalism in the process. <p> Frankly, Romney 's tactic was aimed at low information voters, and it can be debated how many of them were looking at any fact checking whatsoever last night. On the other hand, anyone watching the debates that honestly had no context at all for any of the candidates ' statements, probably is n't going to vote anyway, so - bogus flash polls aside - I do wonder what real impact Romney 's gambit might have on his poll numbers. I suspect not nearly what he needs. <p> --- <p> " The fundamental curse of the Republican party is its irrepressible disposition to meddle with other people 's business, and impose its notions, and its will, on people who do not freely accept them.

He may have looked like the winner to some last night, but he came off to many as a bully, and as his dishonesty was SO extreme, it is hard to believe that it will not become the dominant theme over the next week. <p> BTW - it is up to us to help this become a reality. We need to plant the idea as widely as possible that Mitt is simply a flim-flam man, no different from a high-pressure salesman trying to get you to buy overpriced cookware. <p> If fact-checkers are Twittering out the Romney lies, even those who do not watch politics but do follow Twitter will see it. I 've been posting fact-checking links on Facebook ; even my most low-information voter friendswill see the links. May not click on them and may not care, but it will lodge in his subconscious and maybe made a difference. <p>( aka NobleExperiments).?

But in this election with such enormous stakes for our nation and democracy, I think many millions more tuned in than usually would have, like in 2004 when it was only Bush/Kerry. <p> Maybe I know too much about people 's faces, but I saw really clear insecurity in most of Mitt 's moments. For brief periods he even looked just about frantic. <p> Unlike one suggestion above, he DOES know he 's lying, but what he really cares about is whether he 's seeing positive response in the faces around him, regardless of whether he is speaking truth or fiction. That 's part of why his expressions went fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see audience faces and Obama was denying him the very acknowledgment and validation he needed most. <p> Unfortunately it seems on the morning after that too many people do n't recognize a transparently lying face when they see it. I 'm not saying all lies are transparent. But I did n't think people needed to be an Ekman to recognize a case as blatant as Romney. Can people really not see his desperate need to be believed? Maybe his model-like static features obscure some of what his facial movements telegraph. I saw a( dynamic) facial caricature of Joe Isuzu -- IOW a caricature of a caricature, it was so obvious. Others apparently saw something else. <p> Obama played a game for too sophisticated an audience. I know he was aware of that danger, but like me I do n't think he realized just HOW low he needed to stoop to get resonance even with the pundit class, not to mention Joe Sixpack. He( like me) probably thought Romney was doing a great job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in the man 's way. <p> ------ Ideology is when you give the answers before you know the questions. It is what grows into empty spaces where intelligence has died. <p> " if you ca n't blind them with your brilliance, baffle them with bullshit. " <p> I so wish that somebody would come out with a parody of Mitt that will slightly exagerate his ' style ' so that it will be obvious to everybody -- something like Elmer Gantry, the guy in 101 Trombones, and a flim flam man with the little marble under the 3 walnut shells. <p> Mitt does just about every move the slick salesman does, except pick at his cufflinks and pull out his sleeves. <p> that Romney reminded me of Eddie Haskell crossed with Elmer Gantry. Desperately seeking approval, while slickly spewing falsehoods. There 's a manic quality to his delivery and his absolute disregard of the truth is appalling. <p> He told the truth, in contrast to Romney 's obvious lies. He was humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the usual ass clown, though this time on steroids. This is the dynamic that gives Obama the lead he now enjoys. He obviously knows what he 's doing. Have a little faith. <p> to debate against someone using this technique. Smart scientists have generally insisted on only participating in debates in which the GG is impossible( e.g. a speaker can only raise a single point and then their opponent gets to rebut it immediately). Not surprisingly creationists are reluctant to debate using this kind of format. <p> Debates are bad formats for dealing with complex issues, especially if the audience is n't already somewhat knowledgeable about the issues. <p>... to hit Romney hard on the lies after the fact, paint him as a liar. It is credibility that has to be pummeled. He has n't got all that much to begin with. It would be nice if Obama did it, but he did n't. So it falls to the campaign, and yes, to liberal social media and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our disappointment( which is justified in my opinion) we need to get to work. Obama always did say " yes we can. " I guess he really meant it. It falls to us again. Jeebus, I 'm tired. <p> However, the debate is now recorded. Different pieces can be included in ads either stating the truth, or showing Romney 's prior stance on the issue. David Plouffe seemed really pleased that Romney admitted to being for Medicare vouchers. Count on seeing that segment in a coming ad. <p> makes Romney unelectable, actually. I was screaming about the Medicare vouchers all night. It was the only thing Romney told the truth about. I think Ryan has convinced him they can win on that message. So now Romney is on video, in a presidential debate, supporting Medicare vouchers and saying, do n't worry, we 're only going after the youngsters. <p> Lotsa time left. Romney left lotsa fodder for ads. Sheesh, they can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night. <p> And yeah, everybody involved in the skepticism movement knows about the Gish Gallop. It can not be countered during the debate--it 's actually impossible. I think Obama recognized it on about the third question. He seemed to smile and relax. He knew what he was dealing with, and knew that Romney was wading ever deeper into quicksand. <p> last night, which we tried to get during the health care fight. He probably still intends to keep Medicare available only for seniors, but he spoke about younger people : <p> for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. <p> They get to choose -- and they 'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they do n't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That 's not going to happen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they 'll be able to get a private plan. Link <p> The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right. -- Judge Learned Hand, May 21, 1944 <p> insurance companies will only insure those who are younger and healthier, leaving Medicare with those who are older and sicker. He said that would blow up Medicare. And that 's the Repukes ' intent. That 's the message that has to be spread far and wide, and especially in Florida. You did n't mention the third choice, which is vouchers. That one stings. <p> during the debate. Perhaps there is a way of at least calling out the method during the debate. Maybe something like, " It sounds like your offering many ' facts ' sir, it will be interesting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Or maybe, " You 've thrown ten items on the table there, I will answer this one( then throw a couple that you 'll have to answer back at you). " <p>?? <p>..... it 's on the table, under the watermelon she demurred. Thanks, I was planning on shaving anyway he replied. <p> and it was maddening. The vague questions were dumb. Should be one topic, 5 minutes each. <p> Medicare : go. you have 5 minutes to get across your ideas about medicare <p> Social Security : go. <p> Jobs : go. And I wish Obama had reminded Rmoney that stumping for years on the " private sector creates jobs " bandwagon then trying to spank the government for not creating jobs does n't do much for one 's credibility. <p> Poverty : go. <p> Women 's pay : go <p> Food stamps : go <p> Taxes... and make this one 10 minutes. Rmoney could n't fill 10 minutes of time talking about taxes because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got his 15-words memorized and ca n't get past them. <p> Much easier way to combat the baffle ' em with bullshit tactic and gives each candidate a chance to either present their plan, or bash the other guy. And it would all be on that person. No moderator scapegoats. Just the candidate and their ideas. <p> he let romney cut him off several times, especially at the end of the " sections ". <p> while i respect leher immensely, moderating including more than asking " and what are your thoughts? " You have to follow up if the question is n't answer, you have to have specific questions, keep people on topic etc. <p> call " white male obsessions. " Taxes, the economy( in general, not job creation) and the deficit. I know this debate 's topic of domestic policy was chosen ahead of time but I do n't know if the topics within that more general title were chosen by Lehrer. Whether he made those choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge range of domestic issues including women 's health and equal pay for women,( both of which are economic issues themselves), immigration, equality of opportunity, voter suppression and rights, wages and benefits for workers, environmental protection. The closest any questions came to something human was the health care discussion and not surprisingly, that 's where Obama did very well. <p> turned to Romney and said things like, " If you 're calling me a liar, you had better prove it ", " If you think I 'm doing such a terrible job you had better go back and look at where we were 2008. The economy was literally crashing. " <p> What I think you want to do to someone using the " Gish gallop " is to turn the burden of proof back on them. With every goddamned lie they tell. <p> I 've seen all sorts of liars stopped dead in their tracks by someone simply saying in some form or other, " prove it ". <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefings. he told me to research it. i said I did and the ONLY sources that come up are Limbaugh, Breitbard, the examiner, etc. He then came back with " well, its first-hand knowledge " but since I 'm active duty military I 've probably said too much already. <p> Pure, unadulterated bullshit. I told him to bring the evidence or delete the post. he 's done neither and wo n't respond. <p> to face as a rational, intelligent person, because you realize immediately that your strengths( intelligence, rationality) ca n't stop that train. It 's like arguing with a birther -- they just keep spewing reality free nonsense and all you can do is walk away, and they think that means they won. <p> Do you not see that it is the grossest idolatry to speak of the market as though it were the rival of God? <p> to do that. State that he ca n't debate someone who a) has n't released enough details on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to, 2) who flip-flop on his positions, and 3) throw so many misstatements that it is impossible to take them seriously. I have more pressing issues to deal with tonight. Good night. Walk away with confidence. <p> he could n't counter a coked-up Romney 's Gish Gallop bullshit, he should have ignored everything Romney said. After stating very simply, " That was some impressive tap dancing, might even have been pertinent if there were any truth to any of it. Now, as to my plans, proposals, answers to the actual questions... " And continued on confidently with selling his own brand as if Romney were n't even there. <p> Let Romney bully the moderator and hog the microphone, rudely interrupt and try to talk over the President of the United States( Lehrer needed a ' mute ' button, hope mods get one from here on out) all he likes. Being a bully is what he 's always done best, highlighting that nasty quality would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something in an aside to the most notorious of Mitt 's bullying - walking blind teachers into doors, hacking the hair off a boy he did n't like the looks of, etc. Pithy one-liners about Romney visiting his money in the Caymans or Switzerland - maybe ask which lucky foreign country will host the vacation White House if Mitt 's elected. Then go right back to the meat of his own record and plans for the second term. <p> Romney can only polish his bully-boy bona fides, since he does n't have any actual policies, does n't care about half the people in this country, and ca n't even keep his lies straight from one sentence to the next. <p> Walking away would n't work. Ignoring Mittens as if he were n't even there would work. If Mitt insisted on interrupting, talking-over and throwing insults at the moderator while hogging all the air time with his hissy fits, the American people( all persuasions) would be disgusted. <p> It 's incredible to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating " the moderator. I guess it 's the Crossfire effect 20 years later that the TV class and their audiences are no longer able to recognize Romney as an antisocial type who ca n't tell where the boundaries are and should n't be trusted with authority. Where I was watching, there was a visceral combination of antipathy and embarrassment for the man at his inability to behave like an intelligent white-collar adult in a situation with such well-defined rules of engagement. People did n't wait until after the debate to express it. <p> Apparently Obama got no points for being the adult and the statesman in the room. What we saw last night was exactly why Mitt ca n't be trusted to make state visits to other nations. He has n't yet visited another country during this campaign without making at least one significant misstep leaving a wake of distrust or resentment. It 's because he is tone deaf, not just politically but socially, humanly. He does n't get the unspoken rules even when you try to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed. <p> ------ Ideology is when you give the answers before you know the questions. It is what grows into empty spaces where intelligence has died. <p> from an aide to G.W. Bush shared with us by Suskind : " in what we call the reality-based community, " people like you " believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. "... " That 's not the way the world empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you 're studying other new realities, which you can study too, and that 's how things will sort out. We 're history 's actors... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do. " This is the Republican Modus operandi in a nut shell. Romney did n't make hundreds of millions of dollars telling the truth... he 's a master at the Lie. <p> I think the way to respond to this --based on remarks a number of journalists have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out to the opponent and moderator that many falsehoods are being put forward. But because of social networks, they 're being fact-checked mercilessly as we stand here debating. And the price for that behavior is going to be steep. <p> The victim of this kind of bullying is no longer boxed in to barely responding so as not to appear petty or angry. S/he can make the point strongly that the opponent is lying, without swamping the audience with nitpicking detail, but preparing the audience for the response that 'll be in progress as the event concludes. <p> --For that matter directing the audience with their own portable media to see it for themselves during the debate. <p> The opponent could tell a thousand lies. Two or a thousand, does n't matter, because of the inter for victims of our nation and for those it calls enemy.... --ML King " Beyond Vietnam " <p> had me gobsmacked, and perhaps Obama as well. It is a very, very strange world we are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for, as human race will come from its inability to EMOTIONALLY comprehend the exponential function. " -- Edward Teller <p> " Certainly a lot of your supporters have called me a ' boy, ' but I did n't expect that from you, Governor. " But of course he would n't rise to any bait of that sort. I was absolutely livid when Romney said that. <p> laid the whopper about not having a 5 trillion dollar tax cut on the table, Obama looked at Lehrer, and I swear i saw utter flabbergastation on his face..... like he could n't believe Rmoney jsut said that. I think combined with the crap going on in Syria/Turkey, the altitude, and that slap of lie into the air, it knocked him back on his heels. He tried to ignore and just talk about his policies, but it 's hard to ignore that much bullshit stinking up the place. <p> Plus, I think if he looked at Rmoney, he 'd have laughed in his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies and misstruths you just spewed here, why do n't you explain how you managed to get $100 million in an offshore retirement account when the annual limit $5000? And be careful what you say, because lying on tax forms is felony. <p> Gish Gallops are pretty much impossible to counter. You have to spend so much time correcting the record that you have no time to have your own points given. The president was probably caught unprepared by what a skilled liar could do. <p> Creationists in debates vs. scientists/atheists tend to use this technique precisely because it is difficult to counter. <p> In my opinion, though, Christopher Hitchens was one of the few people who was able to counter a Gish Gallop. If you 'd like to figure out how, watch some of his debates vs creationists. <p> People who use the Gish Gallop are best countered by ignoring them. Fonts of bullshit do n't deserve any sort of recognition in our society. <p> If I could advise the president, I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has background with debating against a practitioneer of a Gish Gallop. <p> Actually, Neil DeGrasse Tyson would probably be a good resource for that too. <p> But when I was on the high school debate in the 70s we called it the spread. Make so many arguments so fast that it is difficult for your opponent to keep up. Then argue that every unanswered point is a point for you. Pretty cool in high school. Pretty dickish as an adult. But so typical of the modern Republican state of mind. Hunker down folks it is going to be a long month. <p> Obama was stuttering his ass off from the start. before any gallup happened. There should be a new tactic called the Obama Sleep Walk - it 's when you do nt fucking show up for an hour and half so you get your ass handed to you by whoever is in the room. <p> I noticed it when he stumbled with what must have been a prepared bit about his anniversary being that night. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to say. He seemed off from the get-go, and this Gish Gallop just ran roughshod over him. <p> Do n't believe what the fossil fuel companies feed you, or pretty soon you will have to pay a whole lot more for clean water... well, maybe not on Lake Superior, but just about everywhere else that had it 's water table " Fracked ". <p> The " Gish Gallop " which I had n't heard of before this diary, but saw Romney use in the debate, allowed him to control the debate. <p> He forced Obama to use his limited time following each moderator question to make a choice between only bad options : Spending his allotted time disputing Romney 's serial lies ; Ignoring Romney 's lies and spend that time making his own points ; Or, attempting a combination of the two, which could result in a seemingly disjointed and less than coherent response. None of those were winning options for Obama. <p> Unfortunately, the moderator either was n't informed enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lies and ask him to explain the discrepancy between what he said( lie) and what the facts actually support. <p> The GOP has found yet another Dirty Trick that seemingly no one knows how to deal with or how to stop--even though everyone knows it 's wrong. <p> technique, but it makes sense. The stream of lies was just unbelievable, but they will unfortunately have an effect on many in the viewing audience who do n't follow politics closely and have no idea they 're lies. <p> As for the idea that social media will take care of it, well, not so much with many older viewers who do n't use twitter, for example, and the medicare lies was one of the most repeated. <p>... I am very familiar with the Gish gallop! It changed the way evolutionary biologists approach these silly " debates " with creationists. <p> The most effective GG has not only a LOT of nonsense, but it also succeeds by throwing out points that the opponent has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly why it is nonsense, he has not come up with a clear, concise answer to it, so at best, he is unpracticed and looks hesitant compared to the well-rehearsed GG-er. At worst, he ends up babbling and appears to have no answer. <p> There was some of this going on last night - some things Romney said came totally out of the blue( to me at least). However, there were many of the same, tired old lies that I have read about here on DK over and over, and they should have been easy to predict and counter. In fact, a few things seemed like slow pitches just waiting to be knocked out of the park ; I thought Romney made a few mistakes that way, but the President did not take full advantage. I wish he had, in his polite calm way, pointed some of these out as blatant lies. <p> Barack Obama does not seem to make a lot of big mistakes, so to me, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the next one will be a lot different. <p> technique. There was no point in further debate because it was not based in reality. I could have called her a liar who was making stuff up, but she was a friend 's mom and I did n't want it to go there and have it descend into name-calling. And she probably just would have said that about me. There 's only so much you can do when it becomes a back and forth of, You 're wrong! No, you 're wrong! Debates on the Internet you can cite links to supporting sources. In person debates you can not. Obama was in a tough spot. Romney simply denied everything he 's campaigned on for the last year. Romney suddenly does n't want to cut taxes on the rich? WTF? Obama brings up a study and then Mitt Romney counters with, well there are SIX studies that disprove YOUR study. WTF? Everyone on the left knows Romney is the etch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent Romney went to re invent himself before those low information voters he 's trying to reach. <p> In the second half of their first debate, Brown attacked Warren on her record working on a legal case related to Travellers Insurance. Brown presented the line of attack quite well( only later did I, an uninformed viewer at this point, learn it was complete bullshit). What really drove the point home was that Warren had no response at all. The second time Brown fired it off, Warren rather meekly pointed to an article which had already refuted the charge. But the damage was done. Brown ended up levelling that debate after digging himself into a hole earlier on. <p> In their second attack, Warren was ready for Brown 's bullshit, or ' gish galloping. ' Unlike the first debate, she DID take the time to refute the bullshit... and left Brown with his tail between his legs for the rest of the debate( Scalia...?). <p> I couldnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night utterly fail to address the junk coming out of mitten 's mouth. I couldnt help but think of how bad the optics were for Warren when she allowed Brown 's attacks to stand. Like many of you, I was screaming at the TV, urging Obama to fight back. Defintely a missed opportunity, imo. <p> But like Warren, Obama does have an opportunity here. Romney, like Brown, scored points with attacks that many uniformed viewers did nt fully comprehend, but were given more credibility by Obama 's tepid response. Still, i think there is still plenty of skepticism surrounding Rmoney. <p> If Obama strikes back and exposes these attacks as utter bullshit and poltical cravenness in the way Warren did, with confidence clarity and a bit of anger, he 'll knock Romney down to a point below where he stood going into the first debate. <p> Im sum, Obama 's oppotunity is the chance to expose, very overtly, Romney as dishonest and low, a man willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing ill say in this ramble is that the town hall format should help, as should the hubris that must be coursing through Mittbots wires. <p> At first, at least. Its denouement, not so much, having outrun its supply lines, overstretched its forced and exhausted its fuel. I suspect that Romney did the same last night too, in political terms. For his win to be sustainable, he and his surrogates will have to back up his lies, and they ca n't. And since they have no choice but to keep spewing them, every time. <p> " Liberty without virtue would be no blessing to us " - Benjamin Rush, 1777 <p> Aggressively and, through his surrogates( but sometimes even himself), viciously and relentlessly attacking Obama with egregious and hyperbolic lies. <p> It might win him some undecideds, and perhaps even swing some Obama leaners to himself. But for every vote he gets, I suspect that it loses him two or more. We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no blessing to us " - Benjamin Rush, 1777 <p> Given the degree of treachery, skulduggery, deceit, misinformation, lies and dishonesty, what did we expect Rmoney was going to do - make nice. Obama got his head handed to him. I hope this is a clarion call for him to wake up and realize the Repugs are about total annihilation of anyone who does not knuckle under to their vision of what they want America to be. Obama has been coasting along with very positive poll numbers and I think he thinks he might have become invincible. His advisors for the debate are a bunch of lunkheads for not anticipating this kind of behavior from Mitt. Obama does not like trench warfare - fight dirty and that was on full display last night. <p> is the ONLY method to deal with Romney. Crush him with brute force blows early, full-bore attack, dirty as it takes, and do n't let up. You 'll notice that by following that strategy Teddy did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing--shutting Romney down. <p> Night while watching the debate last night that when Romney fits in 3 lies in a minute he wins by default because Obama ca n't debunk it all in the time he has. Or to put it short " Romney can lie faster than anyone can fact check " <p> Romney escaped purely on the sheer volume of the bullshit he put forth. I will end your plan but keep the good parts( no specifics) I will cut trillions of taxes but NOT on the rich. I believe in regulations just not any of the ones you supported( no specifics which ones he 'd keep) Romney has explosive diarrhea of the mouth, and there is too much bullshit coming out of the toilet for the plumber to keep up. <p> Thanks to the GOP 's cynical takeover of most of Christianity, today 's conservatives are very church-based. And the right-wing version of religion is all about massive levels of faux-logical-sounding bullshit. " Intelligent design " is one huge mound of it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been trained from an early age that logic is something to work around and facts are something to debunk with bullshit, so you can keep believing the ridiculous thing you 've decided you want to believe. That 's why they 'll think Romney 's a genius... it 's what they want to think, and they no longer have the intellectual skills to realize otherwise. <p> " Glenn Beck ends up looking like a fat, stupid child. His face should be wearing a chef 's hat on the side of a box of eclairs. " - Doug Stanhope <p> Obama : Just starts agreeing, " Oh, yes, I am for that too. " " Yes, that 's my plan, " and so on, and on. For about five minutes until mitt gets so frustrated he erupts. <p> Then Obama says. " Just wanted to see what it was like to switch positions on everything! Hmm. Kind of fun. Kind of hard debating a jellyfish, is n't it Mitt? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole nature of our society is at stake. " Paul Krugman <p> Sure, I wish Obama had eviscerated romney. But while I ca n't say Obama did well in this debate, I ca n't call it a win for romney. romney just spewed a whole bunch of bullshit which will come back to haunt him in ads like this : <p> Virtually every time Mr. Romney spoke, he misrepresented the platform on which he and Paul Ryan are actually running. The most prominent example, taking up the first half-hour of the debate, was on taxes. Mr. Romney claimed, against considerable evidence, that he had no intention of cutting taxes on the rich or enacting a tax cut that would increase the deficit. <p> Perhaps I 'm too sheltered living in the Bay Area, but it bothers me to read everybody saying romney won, when all he did was lie. <p> I imagine Obama will get " fired-up " in the next debate, which is in a town-hall meeting format. Hopefully the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying opponent. <p> I see it all the time when it comes to people disputing Evolution. The only problem with the presidential debates is that Obama ca n't force Romney to be pinned to one point, nor can they fact check on the spot. <p> If Romney is going to use this tactic, the only way he will be thought of as the loser is if Obama asks people to fact check Romney 's statements directly. Even then, there are enough bullshit fact checkers that will muddy the waters. <p> Pretty depressing. <p> I think maybe the best route for Obama is to go full offense, and drop as many problems with Romney 's policies as possible, while at the same time hammering Romney 's lack of specifics. <p> People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya- Rebellion( lies), Arcade Fire <p> " OK, so with the refutation I 've just presented I 've proven you are a liar. Not mistaken, Governor Romney, not confused. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factcheckers proved it after the first debate. So why should Americans waste another 80-plus minutes of this debate listening to you? They know there are other things they can spend their time doing tonight without having you insult their intelligence by lying to them, over and over and over again. They now know you are utterly untrustworthy, and utterly unfit for public office. Case closed. " <p> The president would never do that -- especially in the next debate, which is a town hall meeting -- but, God, I 'd love to see RMoney 's face if he did. <p> Electing conservatives is like hiring a carpenter who thinks hammers are evil. <p> The President could 've easily hit on just 2-3 points the entire time, demanding that Romney answer for them. If he 'd just stuck to Medicare cuts and closing loopholes alone, the President could 've demonstrated how empty Romney 's rhetoric is. There was a mountain of different ways he could 've hit Romney on just those points, taking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of government, etc. <p> Mitt certainly had no problem coming back to the same nonsense talking points over and over and over. Lehrer did absolutely nothing to stop him from running out the clock on every single ' question ' with the same nonsense points. Nothing was stopping the President from announcing that he was going to hammer Romney down on these two subjects as an example of how empty Romney 's claims are. <p> " The Democratic Party is not our friend : it is the only party we can negotiate with. " <p> He was debating a professor of biochemistry on " intelligent design " versus evolution. During the debate, Gish brought up item after item to support his claims.. and these were from a wide variety of domains--geology, physics, atmospheric sciences, etc, etc. The biochemist could debunk the claims that Gish made re biology and genetics, but, unfortunately, was not able to debunk him on his arguments in other domains. You would need several scientists to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an effective technique for Gish : -(. <p> " When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross. " - Sinclair Lewis <p> Named for the debate tactic created by creationist shill Duane Gish, a Gish Gallop involves spewing so much bullshit in such a short span on that your opponent ca n't address let alone counter all of it. To make matters worse a Gish Gallop will often have one or more ' talking points ' that has a tiny core of truth to it, making the person rebutting it spend even more time debunking it in order to explain that, yes, it 's not totally false but the Galloper is **30;1442;TOOLONG the actual situation. A true Gish Gallop generally has two traits. <p> 1) The factual and logical content of the Gish Gallop is pure bullshit and anybody knowledgeable and informed on the subject would recognize it as such almost instantly. That is, the Gish Gallop is designed to appeal to and deceive precisely those sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education. <p> 2) The points are all ones that the Galloper either knows, or damn well should know, are totally bullshit. With the slimier users of the Gish Gallop, like Gish himself, its a near certainty that the points are chosen not just because the Galloper knows that they 're bullshit, but because the Galloper is deliberately trying to shovel as much bullshit into as small a space as possible in order to overwhelm his opponent with sheer volume and bamboozle any audience members with a facade of scholarly acumen and factual knowledge. <p>... someday - the armies of bitterness will all be going the same way. And they 'll all walk together, and there 'll be a dead terror from it. --Steinbeck <p> got approval or notice on any of his questions. Did n't really make a difference, though, since he did n't ask any questions and Romney was going to fill the vacuum with whatever jabbering he wanted to anyways. <p> " The Democratic Party is not our friend : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well, an asst. debate coach( high school and college levels), the Gish Gallop is a technique -as described - that really only works in one kind of debate format : the " open-ended format ". One in which STYLE is inevitably more prevailing than SUBSTANCE. This format is rarely if ever used in serious debate formats. In these, where SUBSTANCE is intended to trump STYLE, and scoring reflects it, it is actually the force of an argument itself that matters, not how it 's presented. Unfortunately, our media prefer an open-ended format, for various reasons, and it therefore becomes incumbent upon the moderator to direct the debate in a manner that will try and enhance substance. This was not done last night( or rarely). <p> Not necessarily in the Gish Gallop but definitely in the Etch-A-Sketchiness of Romney 's performance last night. <p> It somehow reminded me of an extemporaneous debate I had in high school. <p> For all 4 years of HS, my debate partner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our league. We attended a weekend debate competition in our Junior year and at one of the debates in the extemporaneous portion of the competition the surprise topic was Matthew 20:16 " So the last will be first, and the first will be last. " She and I were the affirmative team, so we were up first. <p> We went to a Catholic school but my debate partner, while Catholic, was completely unschooled in the bible and started to freak out during the 30 minute prep session. It took me 5 minutes to calm her down and to come up with a way of turning this on its head. We decided to turn that debate topic into a recommendation to change the batting order of the NY Yankees upcoming game and " prove " that the Yankees would have a better shot at winning if the batting order were reversed. Let 's just put it this way : my debate partner was a Yankees expert, knew all the stats. She was game! <p> When we presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens and pencils in disgust! All their prep was for naught. <p> meant for a one-time event held in a public arena, where attendees wo n't have a chance to digest what was said later. <p> It is not useful on a national televised event that will be discussed in detail over and over, giving time for the debunking of all the arguments one by one and painting the Gish Galloper as a liar. <p> I suppose the GOP was thinking that they would reach people who would only watch the debate and no analysis or follow up discussions. They probably did not consider television commercials to address this, which is how the Obama team is responding immediately. <p> Interesting. <p> " If you do n't sin, then Jesus died for nothing! "( on a sign at a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans) <p>... in th " Town Hall " forum, especially if the questioner is allowed follow up or some future questioner abandons her/his intended question to follow up on something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be too conservative. --Martin Luther King Jr. <p> I wonder if the President would want to go there. It may not be a good look for him. However there is really no answer to being mocked. Rick Perry mocked Romney and it really got Romney angry and sounding shrill. I would use it. but that 's me <p> did the best thing he could do yesterday. He did n't give the Romney campaign soundbites they could use. <p> They probably will bomb the swing states with ads using Romney 's lies in yesterday 's debate and change him from a vulture capitalist into a lying vulture capitalist. Next kill him in the next debate, which I believe is a town hall format. Romney ca n't use this techique as effectively in that format. <p> Every single issue Ed Schultz and Co. wanted Obama to bring up... the 47% comment, the Bain issues, Romney 's taxes.... Romney was definitely prepared with a " zinger " that was poll tested and well rehearsed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position debating Romney is one of mitigating Romney 's bullshit, but that 's where we are. <p> Romney is not a bad debater. I saw that in the primaries. He was always very prepared and aggressive, so I 'm not too surprised by his presentation yesterday. When I thought about how the president should debate him, I was n't coming up with anything particularly good. So after what happened yesterday, I 'm not surprised. <p> I am out of time today, but if we start emailing the definition of " Gish Gallop " around to enough people, the word will spread.... Maybe someone could add last night 's " Performance " to the list of examples? <p> Mitt was using classic B-school style to rattle off his list of points and look strong. Of course the hope is that nobody bothers to read the actual proposal or budget. And of course, it 's supposed to befuddle the people who are going to get their throats cut. <p> What happened last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comment that I posted at Huffington Post last Saturday : <p> Commented Sep 29, 2012 at 19:14:57 in Politics " This past summer the Republicans were going on tv and during the back and forth between them and the Democratic reps. they would seem to win the debate when they brought up a point that turned out to be something of a lie. An example was the first time they claimed that the ACA cut Medicare. I do n't know who it was that brought this point up to Rachel Maddow, but it kind of threw her off her game because her integrity made her unable to respond to something forecefully when she did n't know this " new " information. It turned out it was a lie that they were going to repeat over and over again. If Romney starts spouting " facts " that turn out to be lies, how is Obama supposed to respond? I suspect the " zingers " they plan to use are just more of the same old lies that they hope to use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to respond to lies, lies, lies. " <p> If your opponent is someone that is interested in saying the truth. That is Obama 's achilles heel. Obama should every time Romney finishes talking say Romney is not telling the whole truth on this, and worse yet, he knows it... <p> Then he goes into a standard stump of differentiating their two positions on whatever the topic is. Once you start to refute their specific bullshit you are already lost. Feed the existing memes about Romney, make your points, nicely call Romney a liar and get the hell out. <p> The of the gisher is to run out the clock. He does n't want to say anything, he does n't want his opponent to say anything. It is very tempting to try to refute a list of obvious lies that are told about you, in detail, particularly if they have been refuted before. It bogs you down. <p> not that predicting Romney lying is difficult... we all knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his team announced they were going to ' fact check ' Obama... <p> this was classic Rove debate prep. Accuse your opponent of what you 're about to do. It gives you cover, and if your opponent tries to retaliate, it devolves into a tit-for-tat he-said-she-said sort of juvenile back and forth. <p> " Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities " Voltaire. <p> You put words to what I was wondering -- whether Romney 's strategy was to confuse voters with deliberate misstatements. He 's been pressed to give specifics long enough that he had to say something, right? He knows it takes time to fact-check -- and by that time, voters have moved on to the next news story or debate. <p> In my experience, the more aggressive and in- your-face a person is, the more you need to be concerned about what he is telling you. <p> Last night, someone posted that they tell their daughter to always look people in the eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted a response, but then deleted it because I did n't want to anger someone who was already ranting, and I certainly did n't want to make anything personal. But when someone is in your face, aggressive and not acting at all like their usual selves, like Romney was last night, engaging them is usually the worst strategy because it escalates things. <p> For the president, he would be perceived as the angry black man and not presidential. In real life, however, it 's often dangerous for someone( especially a woman) to engage someone in that sort of situation. <p> I wanted to suggest to this parent that it 's not always a great idea to look people in the eye. Heck, forget about humans : it 's a great way to get bit by a fearful or angry dog. <p> But I did n't because even online, it 's often best to diffuse a situation. <p> So yes, your diary is accurate. When someone is flinging around crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone throws punches, step aside or duck. <p> Mitt Romney has a lifetime of being a bully behind him. He knows what works for him, and it HAS worked for him. But he has n't met many people like Barack Obama. <p> Let 's see how this plays out. All of my money( and yes, that includes donations made today) is on the President. <p> Like contradicting themselves beyond life 's little contradictions, or ' truth be told ' too often, or maybe you are letting them get away with something that would be ok in isolation. <p> The problem is, it 's often tough to realize these people swindled you of your time until you 've walked away, and it 's not worth holding a grudge against that in your heart, so these people get to double-dip. <p> Yeah, " Look you in the eye " is not a good way to judge things, because sometimes people are shy, or they need to close their eyes and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else down, and saying " Look me in the eye... why ca n't you... " double ick. I hate these power games. Romney played them well last night, but Obama is no fool, and Romney probably knows he ca n't play the same game twice. <p> Assuming Obama will be more on top of things in the next two debates, if Romney tries this shit again then the President just needs to verbally shut it down, i.e., " Well, moderator, since I ca n't really tell which Governor Romney I 'm debating tonight--I do n't know if it 's the one who thinks that half the country does n't matter, or the one who thinks that saying the whole country matters will help him get elected, or maybe even another new Governor Romney--I 'm just going to talk about how my policies have helped and will continue helping the American people and contrast those with the vision that Governor Romney, and his running mate as well, has been putting forward for years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of policies, I 'll happily debate him on those. " <p> Or something like that, said in a polite, but forceful, tone that just highlights Romney 's multiple positions and flip flops, while zeroing in on the policies of the " true Romney " that showed up in the 47% video. <p> Nice one-line zinger with resonance for people who still remember, or have heard about, To Tell the Truth. <p> For those who have n't : it was an old TV show where three people would each claim to be a moderately well known celebrity whose face was not instantly recognizable, and the panelists had to sort out who was the real one. It 's also been played as a gag from time to time. <p> I am not familiar with the Gish Gallop GG either but it appears to be closely related to Hit and Run. I would say that sophistry is a better description for BS with a grain of truth. This is something that is common in politics. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate, Obama, brought up, IIRC, three extraneous points which would qualify as the GG and Romney had the nerve to answer the points. When Jim Lehrer tried to cut him off he said, ' No, I have to answer this '. <p> Although there was clearly Hit and Run on the part of Romney and Obama did n't get to answer it all. I do n't think that that is why Obama lost the debate. I think that a single instance regarding the Romney tax plan illustrates Obama 's serious error. Obama lead with his sophistic argument that Romney 's plan would cut taxes by $5 Trillion over 10 Years. This is clearly nonsense since it counts the entire Bush tax cut as a tax cut. So, Romney was able to say with complete honesty that he had no intention of making a $5 Trillion tax cut. The result was that Romney won the point with no real discussion of the actual tax cut which is less than half of that amount. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he clearly does n't get it as he is still trying to sell the same bill of goods about the $5 Trillion tax cut. It is quite possible that Romney 's tax cut as actually proposed wo n't add up. But, as long as Obama keeps up with his Big Lie rather than the actual figures, we are n't going to see an actual discussion of the issue and the point is going to be awarded to Romney since he appears to be being honest about it even if he is n't providing enough detail to see if it will fly or if it needs more work. <p> Or slight Obama win. Romney seemed coherent even though I knew his logic was n't. He was spewing bullshit but I guess it worked and this is why. The president knew not to throw out any hooks for Romney 's planned " zingers. " I though the President won on substance and Romney was strong on energy( not that I liked it). <p> Now the media should do their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on it. <p> And they should make Romney look stupid for suggesting he can be serious about the deficit by firing Big Bird. We know he likes firing people, but to want to fire Big Bird, that 's just cold. <p> stating that Romney had used the William Lane Craig style of debating and then open DK and saw this diary. The Gish Gallop what precisely what Romney had done and it 's a very difficult debating tactic to overcome as it 's only in the fullness of time that the mountain of erroneous disinformation can be discussed and shown for what nonsense it is. That 's why Creationists who are skilled and practiced debaters often appear to have ' won ' a debate against eminent scientists, philosophers etc even though they 've been spouting crazy stuff! It will be interesting to a see if the President can combat that strategy next time. <p> If I recall correctly Sam Harris did well in his debate against WLC because he framed his answers according to the message he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallop - much to WLCs frustration on the night. <p> for this diary. Read it yesterday and logged in again today solely to rec it. Did n't know about Gish Gallop as a technique, although I 've seen it in action a good bit, and have brought it up in multiple conversations in the last 24 hours. You 've done a public service with this. Be well. <p> I have never heard of the gish gallop before but when I was analyzing the debates, this is EXACTLY how I described it... And, as far as I can see, there is NO winner when you have cheated at the game. Romney could n't play by the rules in the first place, he had a cheat sheet( and that thing in his hand behaved like rigid paper and not like a flimsy hanky).. He insisted on more time( over his allotted time) and used this ridiculous and duplicitous tactic to spew more lies and he did it with confidence, assertiveness and ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Republicans stoop so low that the Dems ca n't even anticipate it. They are criminals and they are smart at what they do. He/they( the republicans) are a very dirty, sneaky, duplicitous bunch and may bring down this country yet. We are on the precipice and if the republicans win all, we are finished. <p> Last night, I made an election night version of Downfall. I used this site to do the captions. It appears that it may be on the tip of going viral, as it was
