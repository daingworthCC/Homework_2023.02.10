5114341 <h> Thanksgiving : The Magic Of Conscious Gratitude -- 17 November 2012 <p> " Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet. " Thich Nhat Hanh <p> Do you believe in magic? " Magic is the manipulation of naturally occurring powers by the hand and will of a studied practitioner. Magic is neither good nor bad( white nor black), it simply exists. It is the use it is put to that gives it its perceived polarity. Magic abounds, it is everywhere, in everything and everyone. The first thing you need is to believe. " wiki.answers.com <p> Just what are these naturally occurring powers? The answer is all around us in Nature and within our conscious awareness in the power to focus our thoughts with love and wisdom. What makes one a studied practitioner of magic? Believing in your inherent power to choose, moment by moment, to consciously exercise these powers. And on whatever end of the pole( negative or positive) you focus your power, that you shall reap. <p> The current global situations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality these events bring out this core truth -- we are spiritual beings having a human experience. When we are brought to our knees in the midst of chaos and the illusion of separation propagated by the corporate systems that teach us to be cogs in the wheel of consumerism is shattered, our true natures as spiritual beings emerge as strength, courage, generosity, kindness, compassion and love. Neighbor helping neighbor, far away countries coming to the aid of those in distress, priorities fall into place. NOW we find ourselves feeling grateful to experience who we truly are! We rediscover the beauty of life in the midst of death/rebirth. And gratitude begins to work magic in our lives! <p> The magic of gratitude occurs when you consciously focus your mental and emotional powers on giving thanks for the blessings of life, and you attract more of the same, creating more abundance in your life. <p> " Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thank you, that would be enough. " Meister Eckhart <p> " Piglet noticed that even though he had a Very Small Heart, it could hold a rather large amount of Gratitude. " A.A. Milne <p> " In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it 's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. " Elizabeth Gilbert <p> So in this month of November, when those in the United States traditionally celebrate the great holiday called THANKSGIVING, let us take it to the highest level of our awareness and acknowledge gratitude as the most powerful magic we can use at this time of the Great Shift upon this bountiful Earth! <p> The following is one of two lists published as " The Native American Ten Commandments ". I could not find their origin, but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the words as well their consistency with Native American wisdom teachings.
