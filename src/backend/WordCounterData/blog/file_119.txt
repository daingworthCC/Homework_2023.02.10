5119941 <h> October 15th 2011 -- Rome is burning! <p> We 've told you that it 's just going to take a spark to light the candle... Rome is burning. " A protest against financial institutions that drew tens of thousands of supporters on Saturday took a violent turn as packs of hooded youths waged a city-wide street fight with police. Hundreds of young people launched cobblestones, firecrackers and flares at columns of police who responded with water cannons and tear gas. Police said at least two people, including a police officer who suffered a broken leg, were hurt so far in the clashes, adding that it was still too early to report on the extent of the violence... " said the WSJ approximately 30 minutes ago. We watch as people swarm in the streets - of Iran, Syria, Egypt, London... and now... many, many cities in America in protest of hard times... and " untrusted " governments. " Rome is burning. " This is simply a glimpse of things yet to come. Riots and rebellion start with discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw all three of those ingredients combined last night on American Cable... and I was n't watching the FOOD Network. We 're seeing more and more " Days of Rage " spreading thoughout the land. All it 's going to take is one spark and the rebellion will begin... God Bless Us... every one. Keep your heads down. Rome is burning... <h> HELP US HELP YOU! <h> Welcome to " The Bubba Effect " <p> Blogs are all about strong opinions. After all, if the opinions are n't " firmly held... " what 's the point of reading them? Huh? We 're headed for " tough times, " folks. They 're gon na be the kind of times we heard about from our Grandparents, after they endured the " Great Depression. " And these tough times will require tough countermeasures if we 're going to survive them. That 's exactly what I 'm going to suggest. But hey, do what you want and take responsibility for whatever happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is on. And to those of you who do n't like what you 're reading? Get lost! I do n't have time for " namby- pamby " crybabies who want everybody else to carry their baggage. So sit down, shut up, put on your seat belt, and secure any smoking material! And... of course, your mileage may vary. Let 's just hope your " car " is as well equipped as mine will be. Good hunting! <h> <p> Enter your email address to follow this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email. <p> And the Unions he bailed out, the minorities, the college students and American women did exactly that in overwhelming numbers. He crafted his message and delivered it with pinpoint precision. You have to hand it to him. He built a political palace on the rubble of the last four years of much touted " hope and change " that addressed everything but the economy and jobs. <p> A " community organizer " with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define " inexperience and poor performance ". <p> If you stood with him, you were a " visionary ". If you stood against him, you were a " racist ". <p> I still laugh about that. First, Obama is n't " Black ". He 's of " Mixed parentage " at best. He 's as much " White " as " Black ". Probably more, in fact. <p> People accuse me of being a " racist ' where Obama is concerned. <p> It does n't get any traction with ME. I have to laugh, usually right in their faces. My usual comment is to calmly pull my IDF -- " Thorned Star of David " out of my shirt and then remind them that " as a Jew, MY people were in chains thousands of years before Black people were. " <p> For the record : I do n't dislike Obama because he 's " black ". I dislike him because I feel in my head AND my heart that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hard times. In his Administration to date, he 's done nothing but pour gasoline on an already raging fire. ObamaCare, The Stimulus, the Bailouts to " companies too big to fail " -- that now prosper and laugh all the way to the bank, NDAA, the list goes on and on... <p> IMHO : <p> You DO NOT repair a broken economy by throwing pallets of American Taxpayer dollars onto a funeral pyre. Unless, you 're just trying to illuminate the select handful people standing in the shadows watching it, rubbing their greedy hands together in glee... Or perhaps insuring your re-election... <p> You DO NOT rebuild the American Economy by bailing out an almost " fossilized " American Auto Industry... unless... you 're building a buffer... a wall to protect your re-election bid. <p> You DO NOT stimulate job growth by oppressing the very enterprises that are tasked with creating those jobs in the first place. There 's a reason that Corporations in America are downsizing and moving jobs offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodge any bullets with all these " Administrative Activities ". We simply shifted the damage to our children and increased the devastation as the hardships grow, like rotten fruit to poison our futures... <p> And, Obama now works, seemingly without opposition. <p> The Republicans saber-rattle, but frankly, they 're out of touch with their constituencies and America in general. Otherwise, they would have seen how the Dem 's played to the crowd and understood the grim game they were participating in. <p> Obama 's Chief of Staff all but copywrited the phrase ; <p> " We have the votes. F##k them. " <p> Obama has promised the sheep " Hope and Change " and now he 's unbridled and running wild, like a wolf skulking around in the flock. He has slain the dragon. <p> Obama wants to increase the United Nation 's( UN 's) involvement in American Affairs, even WITHIN the borders of the US. <p> Obama told Putin that he would have " more flexibility " after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of " Hopey/Changey " here in the USA. <h> The Dow Jones dumping 300 points the day after " The Great One 's " re-election is just the beginnings. <p> Obama swore he 'd veto NDAA, a nasty bit of work that enables " Big Brother " to label you a domestic terrorist for insuring that your family eats. It even takes away your rights to due process. <p> Oh, yes, he did. On December 31, 2011, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act( NDAA), codifying indefinite military detention without charge or trial into law for the first time in American history. The NDAA 's dangerous detention provisions would authorize the president -- and all future presidents -- to order the military to pick up and indefinitely imprison people captured anywhere in the world, far from any battlefield. <p> This means they can label you an " enemy of the State ", enter your CHURCH, your HOME, your PLACE OF BUSINESS... and arrest you, dragging you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " domestic terrorist ". <p> And how will they define these traitorous acts of yours? <p> The Department of Homeland Security( DHS) compiles lists of " suspected domestic terrorists " based on your actions ; actions like buying bulk food and ammunition or even( gasp!) speaking out on blogs and websites, urging families to begin preparing for " even harder times ". <p> People exercising their right of free speech are being labeled as " terrorists ". I suppose, cast in that light, we 're actually " counterterrorists "... opposing those who would oppress us and commit harm to our families. <h> Do you know a LEFTY Soldier who needs some " Strat Love "? <p> For some time now,( in fact, since 2009) we 've been rehabbing and sending Lefty Fender Guitars to soldiers overseas. <p> These Fenders are upgraded, stuffed into Fender TSA cases and shipped with all the goodies our paychecks will allow. <p> And every once in a while a battery powered amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can share the love that we 're sending. <p> We 're NOT asking for donations. We 're trying to find hard-working men and women currently serving in harm 's way... so that we can send them a gift to remind them that we love them and understand their personal sacrifices. <p> If you know a LEFTY guitar playing American HERO, we wan na hear about it. <p> Why lefties? Because WE 'RE lefties and we can work on and set up LEFTY guitars. And truth be told, lefties get left out. Lots of righty guitars in circulation. Very few lefties make it into the pool. <p> We think that sucks, so we 're doing something about it, ourselves. <p> And, know that they 'll never know where it came from. " Guitar GIfting " anonymously means just that. We do n't need " atta-boys " or pats on the back... THEY do. <p> And we 're gon na make sure they get them. <p> Feel free to contact us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that they love it too. <h> Jimi would be proud! <p> Who 's the best " Soldier Strat player " on earth? Jimi. And we
