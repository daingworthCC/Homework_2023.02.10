5144941 <p> Anon : Parking in EC is already difficult. Why make it worse? We need MORE parking, not the same inadequate amount of parking that costs more. Why do n't they fork over some of that casino money to cover a garage or new surface lot or something? <p> Blair Wright : Paid parking creates more parking by discouraging our clients from coming into town. Brilliant. Also, good job picking a phone app for parking Howard County. Whoever made that decision should be fired for misappropriation of funds, or maybe pulled over for using their phone while driving. <p> Peter Edelen : There are still property owners who have no idea this is going on.

In the garages, there could be designated parking spaces( free) for those that own property or tenants along main street. Renters generally pay high rents and do n't need the additional costs of ridiculous meter parking. It sounds like the local government is n't listening to what the true needs of the people are and are just looking to make more money. <p> Dan Jenkins : Permits MUST be given to residents if the meters are put in place.
