5138041 <h> How to Make a Mountain out of a Molehill <h> If you wish to create a Mountain out of a Molehill simply, follow the directions below. With a little bit of ingenuity you will form a great big commotion out of nothing. <h> Take an insignificant occasion from everyday life. <h> Shape it and mold it carefully until it begins to grow. <h> Be sure to add fear, anger, and indignation to the problem. <h> Blow it all out of proportion. <h> Once you have successfully formed a large mountain out of a small molehill, stand back and view your creation. Wah-La! <h> EXAMPLE : Last night my husband and I stopped at a chain drug store for a few things. At the checkout counter, the clerk informed us that in order to receive the sale price for the buy one get one at 50% off, we would have to use our " rewards card ". We explained that we did not have a " rewards card ". The clerk then told us that without a " rewards card ", @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that if we signed up right then, we could use the card immediately and receive the sale price. <h> My husband and I felt angry that we HAD to sign up for a " rewards card ". We both became indignant with the clerk. My husband told him that if we did not get the sale price without the card, we were going to shop at the drug store 's competitor. This did not faze the clerk. Clearly, he had heard this rant before from previous shoppers. <h> We needed the products, and we did not want to pay full price. Therefore, I signed up for the flipping card. It took ten minutes to sign up due to a computer glitch that could not find my correct birth date. This made my husband even more furious. Consequently, by the time we headed to the car, he had decided that we were NEVER shopping at that drug store again. <h> As you can see, it is incredibly easy to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yourself. I guarantee quick and accurate results on the first try. Carpe Diem! <h> About bigsmileu1 <p> What good is living life if you do n't share all the experiences, mistakes, and knowledge you have gained? I am a grandmother, a Jr. High Teacher for 15 years, a wife of 31 years, a mother of two grown children, and I want to share my experiences. <p> Actually I think all these " cards " are turning into a real mountain. Not only are they a pain to carry, but they are sucking away our privacy. ok ok.... I guess it really is " small stuff "( but it is hard not to get annoyed!!) <p> Totally understand your card frustration. We never bothered until two years ago when we moved two blocks from a drugstore. We were always walking down for something, so finally signed up for the card. We do get benefits since we buy so much over the weeks and months. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards. I resent being asked if I want one. I do n't have room in my wallet for all the million cards we 're pressured to sign up for. If having one of those stupid cards allows for a 50% discount then the store can afford to give it to all customers not just the ones patient enough to fill out the application and wait for approval and then be diligent enough to carry the card or ensure they have the card when they go to the specific store that has issued it. Its a plastic society and you 're less than worthless if your wallet is n't stuff with all these stupid plastic " discount " cards. ugh.. <p> You 'd think I was rich or something but when I 'm asked about having cards etc.and did I want to sign up for a card for discounts.... I now just say ' No thank you ".... The clerks kinda look at me funny... We really do get discounts by scrutinizing all those lovely flyers that come around.... actually my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices are higher... Diane <p> I do not like that we have to be a member to get a good price on things. It is n't as if the prices are that good, anyway. And, the stores use the infomation to track your purchases. I do n't think the drug store needs to know that I really like chocolate. LOL! <p> There seems to be a card for every store. It is ridiculous that consumers have to be part of a club in order to receive a good price. Not only that, but my wallet and my key chain can not hold all of those pesky, plastic cards. I am glad you liked the
