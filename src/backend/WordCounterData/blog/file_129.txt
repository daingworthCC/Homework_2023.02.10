5120941 <h> No comments : <p> I 'm Valarie- Texas gal with a gypsy soul. l am a wife, Mother, Mimi to two adorable GRANDboys. I love my career as a real estate agent - I have the best clients in the world. Selling homes and changing lives is my passion. In my spare time you can find me in the community giving back to non-profit orgs. I live in a fabulous blue cottage nestled in the " HISTORIC DISTRICT " of Mckinney.
