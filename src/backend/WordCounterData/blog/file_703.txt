5178841 <p> We believe Earth and its ecosystems -- created by God 's intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence -- are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting, admirably suited for human flourishing, and displaying His glory. Earth 's climate system is no exception. <p> in the context of this recent post of his that finishes with this similarly fact-free gem : <p> It 's time for the 99% to start supporting the 1% a little better, because in the end it is the 1% who enables the 99% to maximize their standard of living. <p> I do n't know that there is any better response than we have in the brilliant satire found at " The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus ", well worth the few minutes required to read all 11 panels! <h> Comments <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 24, 2012 <p> Not sure I get it. <p> I am not the 99 percent. I am definitely not the 1 percent. I am the 53 percent. I work 45 hours per week, pay 30 percent in taxes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that I am expected to pay for my neighbor 's medicaid, medicare, welfare, food stamps, and all 91 his children 's needs so that he can go buy shiny wheels for his SUV, go buy gold teeth and new rap records and a new big screen tv to watch the game on? Sounds like one sided deal to me. Instead of the super rich paying a little more in tax, why not let the frauds t the bottom pay for their own cable, cell phone, television, rap cds, new shiny wheels, neew gold teeth and old jewelry, so on? What wrong with them paying for their own stuff? I gueesonly we evil rich white people have to do that eh? <p> coby <p> October 24, 2012 <p> I object to your racist insinuation that only white people can be rich and evil, and suspect similar prejudice lies at the root of the rest of your post. <p> That said, there absolutely should be mechanisms in place to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net systems. However, anecdotes like yours, which is not a very strong one to begin with, do not provide useful data about how many of your tax dollars are wasted on undeserving welfare recipients. <p> I do n't know if it is a lot, but I do know that it has been a right wing distortion since Ronald Reagan 's war on welfare queens. <p> And BTW, for the purposes of these discussions, the 99% includes people in the 53rd percentile. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 24, 2012 <p> Sorry. I fail to include myself in a group of violent left wing protestors, many of whom ae leftovers from the summer of sin( 1967). Fellow, that failed era is over. The only thing the violent left wingers contributed to society in the 60s ws the new era in sin without consequence. Thanks for that by the way. More evil is what we all wished for. I happen to belong to the party of Abraham Lincoln, not Karl Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sovereign individual. My rights come from God and not government. I determine my own fate, not you nd not the government. I am a free man, not a percentage personality. I refuse to be part of your violent left wing movement for so called social justice and so called economic justice and world governance. I am nd will always remain a sovereign individual accountable to God. The only thing that can change that is death and not even death is permanent. <p> Good luck trying to use the tired worn out old race card to get what you want and to try and silence people. We just laugh at you and keep moving. That trick was a nice one while it lasted, but we caught on.

It is a wealth redistribution ponzi scheme. Now I realize that Al Gore and his band of merry men all believe that when everyone goes to bed at night carbon fairies come out and sprinkle carbon dust into the sky and heat the earth. I m not one to believe in such nonsense. Even evolution is easier to believe than man made climate change and believe me, evolution has made a monkey 's uncle out of mankind. Silliest bunch of crud that was ever thought up. Drwin was nothing more that a grouchy old life support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the old hippies and all the new punks at the Occupy rallies. They littered the streets with their filth and then had the gall to preach to everyone else about saving the environment. Hypocrits. Violent ones at that. Their violent reactions looked like something we would see Hamas do in Israel. If the world ever ran out of liquor, bottles, and rocks, hippies and islamic terrorists would n't have anything to throw at normal people. <p> Geoge Bush never gave " tax cuts for the rich " as you people call it. The tax custs went to everyone. I make $11.30 per hour. My take home pay went up about $32 per month becuase of the tax cuts. That sounds like very little but it adds up over the years. The tax cuts were based on PERCENTAGE, not dollars. So, if a person making minimum wage and a person mking a trillion dollars a minute got a 5% tax cut, guess who will get the most dollar amount tax cut? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on PERCENTAGE. If you people would read and do mth instead on crapping on cop cars, littering the streets with used liquor bottles, and complaining about not being able to steal from people who have more than you, you might learn something. Try using your head for something besides a hatrack. <p> Mands, you are typical liberal. Always griping becuase people are not " moving forward ". You are not moving forward, you are moving downward into hell. You keep moving " forward ", and I will keep on staying in the place where thing are normal like they were created to be. Usually when we " move forward " there is hell to pay. The last time we moved forward we got gay so called marriage a fake healthcare system designed to control population. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but endorsing sin is NOT " moving forward " at all. <p> Ian Forrester <p> October 25, 2012 <p> No wonder Insufficient Combatant is so angry.

He is a desperate fool who is angry about everyone and everything when he should stop and look at himself and ask where he went wrong. He probably skipped most of his education.

I did not skip education, though I did skip many math classes in high school. I caught hell in college math, but made it through. <p> Besides.

Community college perhaps? <p> The best way to deal with trolls is to ignore them or laugh at them. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Yes community college. <p> Yes I make $11.30 per hour which the gorss amount would be $462 for forty hours of work. <p> What I actually get to take home with me is about $302 every week. Of course my health insurance accounts for $50 per week, but the other $110 is pure taxes. Federal, state, medicare, social security. Of course I am a white single male, so I have to pay more. <p> Yes Jesus will come back.

He has profited greatly from this ponzi scheme. Now let 's arrest him for fraud. <p> I would not call anyone here a Nazi. It takes brains to be a Nazi. However, there is the anti-Israel sentiment in the democrat party... <p> Mandas, I like your little song there. Do you like mine? <p> There once was a man name Darwin who was never very charmin '. He was old and grumpy becuase his pillow was lumpy. He face was hairy and his brain scary. He nevr used a fork or a plate becuase he ate like his cousin the ape. He told children lie about man and while sat on thye can. He was dope he had no hope He hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids about apes they threw at him some grapes. He was now angry bitter and high, but the kids just laughed at him becuase they knew he was a lie. <p> This was the story of a hairy old fart who used his hat a s shopping cart. Of darwin, people are not a fan, he was just a sick grumpy hairy old man. <p> mandas <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Hmmmmmm, who to believe on this issue? <p> Scientists with PhDs and years of experience, writing peer reviewed papers in science journals based on mountains of evidence, <p> or........ <p> A redneck fundie community college drop out who 's job consists of asking customers " would you like fries with that? " <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 26, 2012 <p> I do not work in fast food. <p> Who do I believe on this issue? 6500 years of Biblical wisdom from the God of the universe or a hippie with a belief in carbon fairies and monkey to men evolution complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals are crap. They only dignify your political stance. A PhD is just a piece of paper. It can burn like anything else. My soul is forever. <p> Peer reveiwed? Who exactly are the peers who are doing the reviewing and what political contribution do you stand to gain by their support? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 26, 2012 <p> And for your informaton, I did not drop out. I did graduate with a degree. It was an Associate of Applied Science degree. But like I said earlier. it is just a piece of paper. Most of the classes that I was forced against my will to take had nothing whatsoever to do with the area of my degree. Schools make you take crap in order to keep you there longer so they can make more money. College is just another money making racket these days. <p> For example. If you were going to learn to be a carpenter, why the hell would you need to take a class in Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with building houses? <p> I am no carpenter, just an example of needless classes that you will never use. Money wasted and time wasted. If I ever do decide to go back, I will only take the classes I need to for the skill that I wish to learn. No more wasted time and money on something that will not be used. <p> mandas <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Biblical wisdom huh? Well then, you should be able to answer a question for me since you know so much about the bible. <p> In Genesis 8:15-19, it says : <p> 15 Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 16 " Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons ' wives with you. 17 Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you : birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and his sons and his wife and his sons ' wives with him. 19 Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, and whatever creeps on the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark. <p> There is an animal in my country called a koala. You may have heard of it. Slow moving arboreal creature. Only eats certain varieties of eucalypt leaves. I was wondering how it managed to get to Australia from the middle east. It ca n't swim, and there would have been nothing for it to eat on the way home. Bit confusing that one. <p> And I have some friends in New Zealand. Their national symbol is the kiwi. Nocturnal flightless bird. It ca n't swim either. I was wondering how it got back to New Zealand as well. <p> I have lots of questions -- but these will do for a start. Perhaps after that you can explain all the internal contradictions in the bible. Since you are an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?.... associate degree in applied science -- you should have no problem. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Oh goody, the boy with no educashun get sot explian things to the Doctor. With pleasure. it is quite simple my hairy palmed friend. <p> Before the tme of the flood, australia did not exist as we know it today. Well, technically it existed, but there was not seven continents. Only once. The seperation of the continents was partially the result of the flood and the breaking apart of the land. Much of the water that covered the earth came from rain, but much of it also came from " the great deep " as well. <p> Over time after the flood man traveled and seperated into nations. Mne traveled the globe. The contnets directly after the flood and after the incident at the Tower of Babel were not as far apart as they are today. <p> Not only that but land bridges due to the ice age that followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well. So, animals got spread all oer the world by boat, land bridges, etc. <p> Most of the dinosaurs that survived on the akr reproduced for a while, but due to the following ice age and due to tribal hunting parties, most were either hunted to exinction for sport of from fear. The rest starved or froze to death. <p> Good enough, or should I redirect you to ken ham and a few thousand more creationist leaders? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 26, 2012 <p> What internal contradictions do you speak of? <p> A smart " scientist " like your self should be able to get on the internet machine that Al Gore created and google " bible contradictions " and see the many unwinnable debates that you liberals call internal contradictions floating about the Gorenet these days. <p> What EXACT contradiction do you claim is in the Bible? <p> What about all the contradictions to American Global Warming? There is not but about 35,000 science majors who are weather and climate science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble is they get silenced. <p> mandas <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Do n't change the subject. How about you answer the questions I asked you about the bible. <p> mandas <p> October 26, 2012 <p> You see my idiot acquaintance, I asked you how koalas walked to Australia and kiwis walked to NZ after the flood. <p> Since, as you just said, the continents were separated after the flood and there was water in the way. There was no ice age and no land bridges 4000 years ago -- there is no reference in the bible nor in the geological record. <p> whoever believes in " the flood " has never talked to someone working in a zoo. It is utterly ridiculous to think that just seven or so people would have been able to look after ALL the spicies in the world for over a year, when it takes around a hundred or even more to keep a TINY fraction of this alive in a zoo. <p> Similarly ridiculous is the notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events but learns it the hard way : " And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth "( Genesis 6,6). <p> And as a consequence the ALL-LOVING god then decides to wipe out 99.99999% of all their creation? Excuse me, how ridiculous is that? <p> By the way, Genesis 6 has some more things that give believers something hard to chew on : " That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose. " <p> SonS of god having sex with women on Earth? Was Jesus among them? According to the christian faith he exists eternally so he must have been present then. NO contradictions in the bible as Insufficient Combatant claims? I doubt that he has ever read the thing, at least he did not understand what it says! <p> " So, animals got spread all oer the world by boat, land bridges, etc. " <p> I just imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiders, etc. with them in their boats when they first settled in Australia. <p> " Good enough, or should I redirect you to ken ham and a few thousand more creationist leaders? " <p> Leaders? These people are either completely out of their minds when they honestly believe what they preach or -- much more likely -- they are simply frauds who have found a clever, albeit deeply depraved way, of making gullible people part with their money. <p> When believers give the tithe to their " church " it only takes a few dozens of followers for a self-proclaimed " priest " to be able to live comfortably on what they give to him. <p> Jan <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Sorry typo : " spicies " should read " species ". <p> Jan <p> October 26, 2012 <p> Contradictions in the bible? <p> Just a short list, naming but a few : <p> God good to all, or just a few? War or Peace? Who is the father of Joseph? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to or lesser than? Which first, beasts or man? How many stalls and horsemen? Is it folly to be wise or not? Human vs. ghostly impregnation The sins of the father Rabbits do not chew their cud Snails do not melt Fowl from waters or ground Odd genetics The shape of the earth Snakes, while built low, do not eat dirt Earth supported? Heaven supported too The hydrological cycle Order of creation Moses ' personality Righteous live? Jesus ' first sermon plain or mount? Jesus ' last words Years of famine Moved David to anger? The genealogy of Jesus? God be seen? Cruel, unmerciful, destructive, and ferocious or kind, merciful, and good Tempts? Judas died how? Ascend to heaven What was Jesus ' prediction regarding Peter 's denial? How many times did the cock crow? How many beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount Does every man sin? Who bought potter 's field? Who prophesied the potter 's field? Who bears guilt? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter of Saul, have? How old was Jehoiachin when he began to reign? Marriage? Did those with Saul/Paul at his conversion hear a voice? Where was Jesus three days after his baptism? How many apostles were in office between the resurrection and ascension? Judging Good deeds For or against? Whom did they see at the tomb? God change? Destruction of cities( what said was Jeremiah was Zechariah) Who 's sepulchers? Strong drink? When second coming? Solomon 's overseers The mother of Abijah When did Baasha die? How old was Ahaziah when he began to reign? The differences in the census figures of Ezra and Nehemiah What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial? What did they give him to drink? How long was Jesus in the tomb? <p> I particularly like its clear and unrefutable logic. There is not much that believers can argue in return. <p> mandas <p> October 27, 2012 <p> Nice start there Jan. Of course, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important fairy story in the collection, you would think they could get that one right. But.... <p> Who carried the cross? What did the two thieves say to hey-sus? What was written in the sign above the cross? What were hey-sus 's last words? Who prepared the body? Who discovered the empty tomb? What did they see when the did? What did they do next? <p> I mean, if you ca n't get those basics right, what hope is there for the rest of the collection of fairy stories? <p> And on the subject of zoos, floods and animals -- yes, I know what you mean. I work with wildlife, so I am pretty familiar with what is required to feed and house them etc. I just picked koalas and kiwis as an example. <p> There is of course the issue of all the fish. How did they survive the flood? Was the water fresh -- if so, all the salt water fish would have died. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh water fish would have died. <p> And a talking snake? Since snakes possess neither ears of vocal cords, it was probably unlikely. <p> But then, logic, evidence, and rationality have never swayed a creationist from their unshakeable belief that a book of fairy stories written by bronze age goat herders is a 100% accurate account of the history of the universe. <p> I think I will stick with the facts. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 27, 2012 <p> The geological record could be wrong. After all, geologists say the earth is billions of years old when the Bible accounts the creation of man 6500 years ago. <p> Yes there were land bridges and an ice age after the flood. Perhaps koalas nevr walked there. It could have been sea faring travelers who spread all over the earth who took these creature hither and yon. At any rate, yes they could have made it there on their own using land bridges and ice glaciers. <p> Jan your so called contradictions are laugable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction do you refer? You cna read for yourself the answer to every question you asked. <p> I am not sure of your intnet on these undisputed so called contradictions. Judas hanged himself by the way. <p> As for talking snakes, there was also a talking donkey as well. It was not the snake or donkey itself who talked, but the angelic or demonic entity controlling it who spake from it. Even King Solomon in The Testamnet of Solomon and The Lesser Key of Solomon possesed a talisman that allowed him to communicate with animals as if they could speak directly to him. This ritual has been in the practice of black magic for centuries, though so called witches to my knowledge have ever been able to tak directly to animals. Solomon 's ring and talisman was of angelic messengers, not made from human hands. <p> " just imagine the Aborigines taking all those harmful, poisonous snakes, spiders, etc. with them in their boats when they first settled in Australia. " <p> Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God who laid with the daughters of men and gave rise to a new race of giants. Yes this happened. There is evidence of giants all over the earth including california, Nevada, new Mexico, and all over the world. There is even Viking lore of warriors who got lost in the underworld and encountered a race of giants and other ugly creatures whom they killed and fled away. The sons of God were the angels who rebelled against God and whom God threw out of Heaven and forced to wander the earth until the time of the judgement. It was demonic entities who created this new race. <p> The bronze age goat herders were smart eneough to know they were created by God and stupid enough to believe they were just another animals like the ones they were herding. I can not say the same for some men today. <p> You go ahead and stick with your demonic inspired " facts ". they will do you well on earth, but will be more than useless on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So I ask again : <p> Who carried the cross? What did the two thieves say to hey-sus? What was written in the sign above the cross? What were hey-sus 's last words? Who prepared the body? Who discovered the empty tomb? What did they see when the did? What did they do next? <p> Marco <p> October 27, 2012 <p> It 's quite funny to see our combattant come with an appeal to scientific authorities... and then claim the existence of a god. <p> Well, here 's something to think about next time he wants to refer to scientific authorities : 93% of the members of the National Academy of Scientists classify themselves as atheists.The top scientists in the US reject your silly beliefs! <p> Wow <p> October 27, 2012 <p> " The geological record could be wrong. " <p> And the bible could be wrong. <p> When you look at it, it HAS to be wrong since it contradicts itself in what is supposed to be accounts dictated by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @Insufficient Combatant, <p> " The geological record could be wrong. After all, geologists say the earth is billions of years old when the Bible accounts the creation of man 6500 years ago. " <p> The important diffenrence being that for the former there is evidence, for the latter there is none other than silly claims in a book that is pathetic at least as far as statements about the early history of the real world are concerned.( I wo n't discuss all the other pathetic statements in that book for now.) <p> The age of Earth is 4,6 billion years, there is no doubt about that since a number of scientifically testable facts unmistakably point in that direction. <p> The mistake that YEC( young Earth creationists) make is nearly a million-fold. It 's like claiming that the distance between NY and LA is only a few inches and not 2800 miles( courtesy to R. Dawkins for that comparison). <p> Geology is definitely NOT wrong about the age of Earth. Just learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie or documentary that shows mountanous landscapes. In most of them you can see the layered structures of sedimentary rocks. Even better : go and see for yourself in real nature! <p> WIth a little knowledge of geology you will soon understand that each individual layer -- sometimes only an inch or less in thickness -- may take as long as a hundred years to be formed. And what 's more, some of these layers can only be formed on the sea bed, while others are formed by erosion and wind only on dry land. And these layers alternate! So how could they have been formed within a few days as YECs claim? Absolutely impossible! <p> And then there 's radioactive dating, a method that has been developed and tested for more than a hundred yeras now and gives very reliable data about the age of the material probed. <p> These are but two examples of how the old age of Earth can be demonstrated scientifically beyond any doubt. <p> The sad thing is that most YECs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they are talking rubbish and consciously lie to their fellow human beings. So much for honest Chrisitans! <p> Those who honestly believe their nonsense are too stupid to argue with. They would not accept nor understand any facts about the real world because they have formed their own, utterly ridiculous, view of the world from religious hearsay and are totally immune to facts, reason and logic..( Mind you, the vast majority of those people who call themselves Christians are totally ignorant of what the bible really says, they just believe what others have told them about the book.) <p> **31;3872;TOOLONG <p> October 28, 2012 <p> I too work hard and know many in the high tech corridors who spend 70-80 hours a week on average. I can assure you that they do n't have enough spare time to write long childish diatribes like " InsufficientCombatant " does. This guy is a loser who seems to have wa -- a -- yy too much time on his hands. Ignore him. He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From now until the time of Christ 's birth is roughly 2012 years. <p> From Christ back to Abraham is roughly another 2000 years give or take 50 years. <p> From Abraham back to ADAM, the first man, is roughly about another 2000 years. <p> This puts mankind 's age at about 6000 to 6500 years. <p> The grand canyon is how old? Being that it formed as a result of the global flood in Noha 's day, it is fairly young along with many other things that you say are very old. <p> Dating rocks on top of the ground exposed to radiation and fires is NOT an accurate way to tell the age of anything. <p> The Bible is wrong? Well, you are entitled to your opinion. It is your manmade history and geology books that are wrong my hairy palmed friend. <p> Wow <p> October 28, 2012 <p> No, it puts the age of the fictional geneology at 6000 years. Or maybe 10,000 years. A lot depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIFFERENT geneologies in that bible. <p> However, mankind as a Hominid has lasted 5-7 million years, with many species occurring millions of years before that. <p> You would have thought that the writers of the bible would have mentioned a Diplodocus or a T-Rex, would n't you, if it were right that mankind was made such a short time after the first creatures made. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 28, 2012 <p> No such thing as your mythical " millions of years " and no such thing as evolution. Apes were created as apes and man was created as man. Fully intact as you see them now. <p> There was leviathan and behemoth. An animal so large that its tail was " like a cedar tree ". That hardly dexcribes a regular lizard. King nebuchanezzar had in his possession a great " dragon " which his peope captured and kept locked away. This captured dinosaur or " dragon " was there even when Israel, or Judah, was captured and Daniel and the Israelites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible does kind of talk about dinosaurs. Even when Moses was leading the Israelites to the promised land larged winged creatures( flying dragons) would swoop down and try to pick up people. I hardly thing a buzzard or an eagle could do such a feat. <p> Some Pterasaurs still exist to this day. I once saw an old photo from th civil war with union soldiers who killed a larged winged creature with no feathers. This beasts wings were enormous. The body was arger than the soldier who killed it. The wings had to be 7 or 8 feet long each. Even in the congo there are still reports of large creatues with leathery wings that stil fly around, not to mention Mokle-Membe, the smaller dinosaurs that were sighted as late as the 1990s. Even in malta such reports have occured as late as 2003. <p> I feel i am wasting my time trying to get you to think outside thee science box and listen to reality. Science can not explain everything. Somethings you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 28, 2012 <p> Oh, Conservapedia is really predicting that 2013 is going to be a bad year for darwin worshippers. Looks like evolution is going to crumble. Oh and you are just in time as well. They are talking about your mythical Bible errors there today as well. <p> Wow <p> October 28, 2012 <p> And, in line with previous accuracy records, conservapedia will be wrong again. <p> Mythical bibe errors? <p> You 've never read the bible, have you. <p> kai <p> October 28, 2012 <p> wow, you wo n't even be close to understand of what i am trying constantly -- without any success -- to instruct you : your insane climate idiocy is by far more primitive than anything else you are criticizing here. just shut up blaming others they are idiots when you by far are the biggist idiot around. <p> mandas <p> October 28, 2012 <p> I 'm still waiting for an answer : <p> Who carried the cross? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in the sign above the cross? What were hey-sus 's last words? Who prepared the body? Who discovered the empty tomb? What did they see when the did? What did they do next? <p> Jan <p> October 28, 2012 <p> @Insufficient Combatant, <p> I wonder if conservapedia qualifies for the biggest heap of BS in the universe. <p> Reading that stuff is an utter waste of time, there are hardly any correct claims among the collections of errors and lies that they spread. <p> Conservapedia is an insult to any honest conservative( provided, there are any). <p> As I said before, anybody ho believes that Earth could not be older than 10,000 years, is an idiot, who does not have the slightest knowledge of the world about them. <p> Have you ever heard of ice-cores? They are one of the many, many different ways of proving YEC to be wrong. <p> In Greenland the ice is some 10,000 feet thick and its age is about 600,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new layer of snow is formed and during the short summer there is a partial melt at the top which makes it easy to distinguish one layer from the other. So when scientists extract an ice-core by boring a vertical hole into the ice they can actually count backwards over long periods of time and pin down a layer to one particular year. So there is absolute calibration of the age of the ice. Errors can be ruled out because the dating can be cross-referenced to historical events whose years are known from other sources, e. g., the eruptions of volcanoes that leave volcanic ash in the corresponding layer. <p> Mount Vesuvius may serve as an example : as almost everyone knows, one large eruption, in which Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed, occured in the year 79. So when scientist examine ice from that and the following year they do find deposits of volcanic ash that can be verified as coming from Vesivius, since each volcano on Earth has its own characteristic combination of elements( and their isotopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant idiots who claim a young age of Earth! <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 29, 2012 <p> @Jan <p> I offer my apologies for being wrong. I understand that you were there to witness all this isoptopeness and volcanic ashiness happening? If so, my apologies. If you were not there, you are wrong. Ice cores prove nothing. The largest flood in earth history happened 4500 years ago and the proff is on every continent on the planet and you talk about some ice core. Ice can for m rapidly and core can be decieving just like telling the age of a tree by its rings. Some years have more than one ring growth. Ice cores are an even worse example. <p> If that is not enough I can get you much more. Do n't even start on oil either. I can hurt your feeling real bad on the subject of natural earth made oil. <p> mandas <p> October 29, 2012 <p> Come on IC, I am still waiting for you to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions. When are ytou going to respond? <p> Who carried the cross? What did the two thieves say to hey-sus? What was written in the sign above the cross? What were hey-sus 's last words? Who prepared the body? Who discovered the empty tomb? What did they see when the did? What did they do next? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 29, 2012 <p> Which book of fairy stories would that be? <p> I do not have any evolution or global warming books, so I can not look at a book of fairy stories. <p> mandas <p> October 29, 2012 <p> Typical creationist. Has n't even rad the source of his ideology so he ca n't answer questions about what is in it. <p> At least I base my views on things I have read and understand. You should try it sometime IC. It 's called having credibility. A new word for you I know. It stops people from laughing at you when you make a claim about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually says. <p> mandas <p> October 29, 2012 <p> So, I 'll make it easy for you since you have n't read the bible yet. Just answer the first question then we will come to the rest. <p> Who carried the cross? <p> And since you have n't read it yet, I will even give you the references to save you looking it up. Obviously you will find all the details in the gospels. Try : Matthew 27:32 Mark 15:21 Luke 23:26 John 19:17 <p> So now you have the references, how about you look up what they say and let us know the answer. I say answer, because, as you say, there could not possibly be any contradictions. Could there? <p> Jan <p> October 30, 2012 <p> @mandas, <p> I do not think we 'll get an answer from IC. <p> The bible passages you pointed out to are too embarrassing for any Xtian who asserts that that book is inerrant. <p> The bible is full of contradictions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is manslaughter, mass murder, genocide and many, many other atrocities dierectly commanded by the god of those bronze age people. <p> And Jesus justified all those things when he said that not a iota must be taken away from the old scripture. <p> When Xtians claim that the bible is full of moral commandments and even the very basis of morality, they are negating all the ghastly things in the book, they are cherry-picking to the extreme. <p> Our modern world view is a result of the age of enlightenment and most ethical insights were achieved against the fierce resistance of organised religion. <p> Wow <p> October 30, 2012 <p> And without the Old Testament, there 's no Original Sin for Jesus to be crucified for, nor any reason for anyone else to follow him to remove that( nonexistent without the OT) sin. <p> mandas <p> October 30, 2012 <p> Looks like IC has left the building. Must have become too hot for him. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 30, 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the upper 50s and lower 60s. Quite nice. <p> WOW is right. Jesus chose to come here and offer salvation becuase of what happened in Genesis. <p> mandas <p> October 30, 2012 <p> So how are you going with your research IC? Read the bible yet? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 30, 2012 <p> Jan, <p> The people who were destroyed were not destroyed for no reason at all. They were wicked and evil and had no hope of ever returning back to God. Sort of what we see here today. Every person is a sinner before God. However, if those nations whom God judged had repented of they following of Satan, He would not have destroyed them. Instead He would have saved them and blessed them. They made their own choices to be destroyed. <p> Many of the cities and people who were judged were given multiple warning to repent and be saved, but they freely chose to ignore the warnings and kept living in sin. They brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Every human on earth including the most militant atheists have a religion and a God. Fir you your God is your science. it is your idol. It is what you look to for answers and since you put it first in our life, it has become your religion and your God. There is no such thing as opposition to religion in that sense. Your global warming( earth worship) and your evolution( idol worship) is your religion nd it is well organized. The thing you have to do is seperate the false satanic religions from any real religion. Yours is one of satan. It is HE who tricks you and causes your to think as you do -- backwards. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 30, 2012 <p> Yes I have. have you? Mandas, many ibs say that Jesus was a socialist. What is your thoughts on this. Your repsonse will determine wether or not YOU have actually read the Bible. I am not a gambling man, but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say you think Jesus was a left wing communist. It is how liberals think -- backwards. <p> mandas <p> October 30, 2012 <p> So since you have read the bible IC, could you answer my question please. Who carried the cross? <p> Wow <p> October 30, 2012 <p> " They were wicked and evil and had no hope of ever returning back to God " <p> Because God killed them, just like he kills 90% of unborn children, pychopathic monster that he is. <p> Jan <p> October 30, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " The thing you have to do is seperate the false satanic religions from any real religion. " <p> Real religion? You must be joking. Just see what Mark Twain wrote about human beings and religion : <p> " Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion -- several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother 's path to happiness and heaven. " <p> Do you really believe in such a thing as satan? Wake up! We are living in the 21st century, not the Dark Ages. Leave your childhood superstitions behind and grow up! <p> If you believe that your god gave you the abilitiy to use your brain, why do n't you put it into practice? If your god was real, they would have made a much better job of making themselves perceptible to intelligent beings. <p> All that you and followers of any other religion have are old books that all full of contradictions and do not hold up to any severe scrutiny. Only people with a twisted mind would accept those scribblings as " truth ". <p> When you are a catholic you believe that your religion and your god are true, when you are a protestant you believe that your religion and your god are true, when you are a muslim you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you... etc., etc. <p> They can not all be true. All of them are full of logical mistakes, so they neither of them can be completely true, but it is almost certain that all of them are completely false. <p> I think that Steven Weinberg was right when he said : <p> " Religion is an and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. " <p> " The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction : jealous and proud of it ; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak ; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. " <p> Everyone who has read the bible must admit, that Dawkins 's description fits Yahwe to a t. <p> kai <p> October 30, 2012 <p> jan, your german english is really one big shame <p> kai <p> October 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "... xxx have come across...

And extremely funny when he tries to do so in his Pidgin English. <p> kai <p> October 30, 2012 <p> jan, " it rather amuses me " is " rather " poor english. in addition you have a lot of grammatical troubles in correctly using personal pronomina, because you always mix up " who ", " which ", " that " and " which ", which bothers me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve your basic german school english. <p> Dunc <p> October 30, 2012 <p> kai, your English is terrible. " It rather amuses me " is perfectly fine. " Pronomina " is n't even an English word -- it 's Latin. The word you seem to be looking for is " pronouns ". Oh, and " grammatical troubles " is incorrect -- it should probably be " grammatical trouble ", but even that is a clumsy construction which no native speaker would ever use in this context. You also seem to have some sort of problem with capitalisation. <p> Jan <p> October 31, 2012 <p> @Dunc, <p> you are absolutely right. Kai 's command of English is certainly far below standard. <p> And whenever he tries to be clever, he puts his foot in it. Trying to boast with his grammatical knowledge, he only shows that that is nonexistent. As you pointed out, he does not know the correct terms and what is even worse, he mistakes one term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which " and " that " are pronouns alright, but other than he thinks they are relative pronouns and not personal pronouns. <p> What an idiot that Kai is : Only a fool like him would constantly make a fool of himself <p> kai <p> October 31, 2012 <p> dunc, hahahaha <p> jan, hahahaha <p> plain idiots, the two, but no surprise : they are low-intellect agw hysterics, hahahaha. they are just angry ugly climate dwarfs who( not " which " or " that ", jan, that what you have to learn)... <p> ps : jan, your terrible german school english is utter impertinence <p> ps2 : dunc : i assume you do n't know latin, is n't it? should we make a test with you? please translate the following into english : nihil sunt mores aequitoribus substantiae principitis spectavit <p> kai <p> October 31, 2012 <p> jan, again style corrections for you : <p> you said : " Trying to boast with his grammatical knowledge " <p> this is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kai always impresses me with his perfect knowledge of the grammar of the english language " <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Looks like IC has run away with his tail between his legs.

All his life he has been told that the bible is the literal word of god, and as soon as he notices that it is full of mistakes, smoke started to come out of his head and he spun around in circles saying ' Does not compute!

Better read you Bible. WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit? He still tricks people today. The moder forbidden fruit is some of your science idols like evolution and global warming. As long as Satan can keep people believing that there is no God, the more people he takes down to hell with him on judgement day. <p> The century does not matter. God and satan was real when this earth was created, they are real now, and 999 trillion forevers from now they will still be just a real. Nothing has changed except perception. God does not change. Period. <p> Richard Dawkins is just a loon who craves attention and cries when people do not give it to him. Mark Twain is irrelevant to any serious conversaion about religion. Apparently dawkin never read the part about where God OFFERED to saved those who would repent. Again, the people chose their own path to destruction., They were given multiple warnings and plenty of chances to turn back, but freely chose not to. Dawkins is an idiot. <p> mandas <p> October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IC. <p> Who carried the cross? <p> coby <p> October 31, 2012 <p> kai, you said : " who of you cowards and blatherskites, wow, whirlpool, mandas etc. dares to risk your OWN money to bet that in the next few years there will be a new arctic sea ice minimum, you terrible hypocrites and decadents : RISK YOUR MONEY IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU TRY TO STICK TO YOUR HYSTERIC CLIMATE CO2 CATASTROPHE CONVICTION " and I replied : " I will gladly take you up on a $10,000US bet that a new record low in the arctic sea ice extent as reported by NSIDC will be set on or before October 2020.

Well no one else does either, so please just go away. <p> mandas <p> October 31, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well. I will put my $10,000 up against kai, and we will get a neutral party to hold the cash. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 31, 2012 <p> mandas, <p> Who carries the cross? <p> Well at first Jesus did, then Simon of Cyrene. <p> Not sure what the point of your aggravating repetative malfunctions are, but there is your answer. <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Thanks for your response IC. But as I am a sceptic, I will check the source document to see what it really says : <p> From John : 19:16 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. 19:17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha. 19:18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. <p> Hmmmmmmm -- ca n't see any mention of anyone called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it himself( " he, bearing his cross.... "). Perhaps you are thinking of Matthew : <p> 27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. 27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross. 27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull <p> That 's a little confusing. Matthew clearly says that Simon carried it, but John clearly says that Jesus carried it. And neither of them say that there was any sharing going on. <p> So thanks for your response. But as it isn " t correct, we ca n't really call it an answer can we? The word I would use is " lie ". <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Never minf IC. perhaps you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two thieves say? <p> kai <p> October 31, 2012 <p> coby, 2020 is too late to get my money from you, as you are maybe already dead. so let 's say by 2013 to have a quicker decision and that I get my money from you quicker within reasonable time. agreed? <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> No kai -- it is not agreed. <p> We either stay with the original terms of the wager, or you apologise for your idiotic statements. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Mandas, you are confused. <p> Matthew, mark, and Luke all mention Simon of Cyrene. <p> The common consensus is that Jesus did in fact start out carrying the cross, but due to his massive beatings and loss of blood He was unable to make it all the way. Simon of Cyrene helped. <p> Matthew 27:32 Mark 15:21 Luke 23:26 <p> Also can you account for the prophecies in the Old Testament about Christ that came true? Isaiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of Christ. <p> Jesus was carrying His own cross and was unable to finish his journey, then came along Simon of Cyrene. <p> If this is one of your alleged contradictions, it is a weak one. No contradiction whatsoever. The Romans drafted Simon to carry the cross the rest of the way. <p> You have probably been window shopping at some left wing anti-God website again. Those who make claims of contradictions becuase they have little else to do than to argue with people. <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Wrong! You ca n't just make shit up and expect people to accept it. <p> You and all your ilk claim that your book of fairy stories is infallible, and that it is the literal word of your god. Unfortunately, for you, John very specifically states that Jesus carried his own cross, and does not mention anyone called Simon at all. <p> And that 's just one contradiction. Let 's move on to the next one in this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> kai <p> October 31, 2012 <p> mandas, shut up, who has asked you? what low class people like you will never understand is that the rich and strong define the conditions, in other words, me and not you. when you accept my rules i decide whether you can be part of the game or not. <p> i offer now a sea ice( arctic) bet for 2013( that no record minimum will be seen in 2013) because i do not want to wait until 2020 to get my money from coby who will lose all bets against me. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Let 's not move on to anything until you have understood the first one. Really do not care if you do not believe it. I know there are no contradictions and the fact that I destroyed your alleged contradiction angers you. When you accept the answer I gave you for your first alleged contradicion, we will move on the the second. <p> Jesus carried His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans got Simon of Cyrene to carry it. <p> Write it 5,000 times until you can accept it and then we will move on to your next alleged contradiction. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> October 31, 2012 <p> Mandis, <p> What planet are you originally from? Are you draconian, reptilian, grey, grey-reptile hybrid, or Mantidian? <p> I think you may be a plant. Answer me this? Do you have a soul from God or is your soul captured via your machine or is it an artifical soul your kind created for healing? <p> mandas <p> October 31, 2012 <p> No IC. It is not that I do n't believe it. I do n't believe anything. I accept evidence. <p> And you have no evdence for your views on what the bible says. The evidence is quite specific -- it does not say what you think. It says the opposite. If you think it says what you claim, provide the quote here for all of us to read. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a bunch of meaningless, unsupportable assertions. <p> And soul? No such thing. I am an animal, just like all the other animals I study. I am no better, no worse. I just evolved differently. <p> Jan <p> October 31, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " Satan is as real as God. " <p> Full agreement, but other than you think neither exists. Thereis not the tiniest bit of shred to prove the existence of a god, let alone the Christian god. <p> And about your soul : forget it. There is no such thing. Neurology has clearly shown that consciousness, personality and all the rest are produced by the brain. When the brain stops functioning, all these qualities cease to exist. There is even a fraction of the brain that is responsible for religious feelings or other illusions. <p> Chemicals( drugs) can strongly alter the way the brain sees things, when parts of the brain are injured the personality -- some people call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Insanity is a malfunction of the brain -- no demons involved. <p> To believe in satan is to believe in a childish fairy tale. If your god was merciful -- as you claim they* are -- they would not condone such an entity as satan -- or do they not have the power to get rid of satan, that " allmighty " god? <p> You see, your belief and your world view is full of contracdictions, I do not even need the bible to prove you wrong, somple logic suffices. <p> * I use " they " because it is not clear whether your alleged god is a he or a she or does have any gender at all : <p> " When god created man, SHE was only practicing. " <p> Your bible even uses the plural when it talks about its god! <p> BTW, what Christians believe to be extraordinary, i. e., the resurrections, seems to be quite normal to Matthew( ch. 27) : <p> " 52 And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which slept arose, <p> 53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. " <p> Strange, very strange! <p> mandas <p> November 1, 2012 <p> It 's more than that Jan. <p> If a god were to exist, it would have to be gender neutral -- an ' it '. Male and female are biological entities, and are simply two ' halfs ' of the one whole. You can not have male without female. If -- as all monotheistic religions claim -- their god is male, then it automatically implies that there must also have been at some time or other a female as well. You can then take that further, and show that a single breeding couple is also nonsensical, and there must have been sufficient in the population of the ' god ' species to ensure its viability. <p> Now, you might claim that a single male is all that remains of the species -- and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all that is left of a species, then the members of that species can hardly be considered to be omnipotent. Maybe that 's what happened to all the other gods mentioned in the old testament. The Abrahamic god was certainly jealous and worried about them -- always telling his followers that they had to worship him and not the others. <p> That 's the problem with all these poor deluded fools. They believe the bible is the literal truth, given to man by an all powerful singular deity. But when you check that ' literal truth ', it is easy to see that it is full of holes and contradictions. Creationists fill those holes by ' interpreting ' the bible, to see things that are n't really there and which they believe ' should ' be there. IC 's claims about who carried the cross are a perfect case in point. <p> But of course, the person doing the interpretation and the differences in interpretation between the various religions is the whole reason why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is the only real one, and every other faith is wrong and deluded. The largest christian church in the world no longer believes that the bible is the literal word of god, and now believes that it is a collection of fables. They accept evolution and the fact that earth is not the centre of the universe, and believe that AGW is a significant moral and existential threat to humanity. Fundamentalist creationists like IC believe something different. <p> The difference in beliefs can only be attributed to the personal views and teachings of the leaders of those particular churches -- the clergy. And when you base you beliefs, laws, and morals on the directions of a clergy, you have a theocracy. And I would prefer not to live in a theocracy thank you very much. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 1, 2012 <p> Mandas, you admit that you are an animal. So, if you go out and kill 50 people and eat their flesh why should you be viewed different than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are animals too. Why two sets of rules if we are all just animals? <p> No mandas, I am not animal. I an man. I have a soul created by God. Adam, the first man, had a soul. He was created, not evolved. Jesus was present at creation. How many times in the New Testament does Jesus mention creation? How many times does he mention Adam? <p> He came to fix what Adam and his wife Eve along broke. <p> Believe what you want. If you want to be an anima, then sell your home, take off all your clothes and throw away all your possessions and go into the wild and live like an animal. Otherwise, do not state that you are an animal unless you are willing to back it up with actions of animals. <p> mandas <p> November 1, 2012 <p> Of all the deluded things I have read from a creationist -- and just about everything they write is deluded -- that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the best of them. <p> Kill and eat 50 people because I am an animal huh? My dog is an animal, and I ca n't remember the last time he killed and ate 50 people. Nor my snake. Not too many antelopes or birds kill and eat people either. <p> You want me to back up my actions with the actions of animals? I do it every day. I do it every day when I eat and breath. I am a heterotroph( look it up). <p> And I will say it to you again until you get it. I do n't ' believe ' anything. I accept evidence. And until and unless you provide any evidence for any of your assertions, they will remain exactly that -- evidence free assertions. <p> Wow <p> November 1, 2012 <p> " if you go out and kill 50 people and eat their flesh why should you be viewed different than a crocodile or lion that would do the same thing? " <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> November 1, 2012 <p> " then it automatically implies that there must also have been at some time or other a female as well. " <p> There IS a " Mrs God " in the bible( Old Testament). <p> mandas <p> November 1, 2012 <p> " There IS a " Mrs God " in the bible( Old Testament). <p> I take it you mean Asherah, who most biblical scholars accept was the wife of Yahweh. That 's probably true, although all direct mentions of her have been removed from the current biblical canon. However, she is still known in the Hebrew Bible as the Queen of Heaven, and was worshipped alongside Yahweh as two of the principle gods of the Israelites. <p> That 's what is so fascinating and important about history. When you study it you learn about the basis and background for all sorts of things, and you can place current culture and practice into context.. <p> We also understand the political underpinings of religion and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and influence. Look no further than the influence of Constantine and the Council of Nicea to understand how that has affected christian doctrine to this day. <p> Of course, creationists do n't understand this. They are so entithetical to knowledge and science that they are blind to anything other than what their clergy tells them. That is why creationist churches oppose education. They do n't want people to know the truth -- it would jeopardise the power they have over the gullible. <p> Jan <p> November 1, 2012 <p> @mandas, <p> " That is why creationist churches oppose education. They do n't want people to know the truth -- it would jeopardise the power they have over the gullible. " <p> That sums it up very nicely. Thank you. <p> To believe means not to know. Believers make up things as they go along and never mind what discrepancies may arise from their fantasies. <p> The bible is 100% man-made, it was evenly arbitrarily put together from a host of religious writings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what people in the past thought about their god. <p> How arbitrary especially the Chrisitan religion is, is demonstrated by the fact that there are thousands of different denominations, each laying stress on different aspects of what they think the bible says. And each follower of a denomination is convinced that they are the only ones who see things correctly and everybody else is wrong. <p> However, most people do not take their religion seriously and actually know very little about even the basics of their creed. Unfortunately this makes room for the extremists, who can spread all sorts of nonsense and only non-believers see through their outrageous claims that mock all reason, logic and even plain perception of the world around us. <p> I am always flabberghasted anew when I have to realise that there still people around who actually believe that Adam and Eve were REAL and not just the result of a feeble and shoddy attempt of explaining the origin of human beings, ergo a mere product of fantasy. <p> I feel pity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most absurd things, but contempt as well, because they constantly refuse to use reason and logic to challenge what they have been made to believe, despite the fact that it deeply contradicts what they could know about the real world. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Well mandas you just go on being a monkey 's uncle and accept your little manmade evidence andI will go on believing in what the creator and sustainer of the universe has done. <p> Yes kill and eat 50 people. Your dog has not killed and eat 50 people becuase it is domesticated. If it were wild it probably would kill and eat people. Other dogs like wolves and such will occassionally attack and kill children) people). However the difference is, your dog is trained and instructed, and domesticated. Your snake has not killed and eat people becuase it again is domesticaed and probably is not large enough to eat someone. If you had a 50 foot anacond with a three foot girth in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation becuase you might have been eaten by now, and YES anacondas get that big. They can swallow deer and grown men. Ask any tribal elders in the amazon. <p> So antelopes don ; t kill people. Wan na bet? Get one cornered and see what happens. Birds do n't attack people? Hmmms. The elusive thunderbird picked up and carry a small child from a field in 1871 in north mississippi. Eyewitnesses have seen birds in Pennsylvania at night on the side of the raod near dead carcasses large enough to carry off a person. If you corner a bald eagle or a buzzard they will attack. <p> Liberalsalways seem to think the soft little innocent pant eating animals are not dangerous. Some of the most dangerous animals on earth are herbivores. The Black Rhino, wild elephants, Buffalo, Moose, Water Buffalo( Black Death they are called in Africa), etc. So don ; t think just becuase an animals is a plant eater that it means you no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know when you find it. As for me, I do n't need your evidence. I already know what I need to know. <p> If you are looking for evidence of global warming and evolution you probably will not live the 999 trillion millenia that it would take to find out that there is no evidence for either one. <p> mandas <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Yeah that 's right IC -- you do n't need no stinking evidence or none of that education. You already know everything! <p> And thanks for the information about animals. You do know I am a wildlife scientist, right? But what would I know? All my knowledge came from years of university education, working with peers and mentors, and working in the field -- collecting evidence and analysing what I and others find. In fact, I am off on Sunday for a month working in the field in Queensland on an endangered species recovery program. My wife is an animal scientist and works with ART -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program using two closely related but separate species. It 's fortunate that the two species are still capable of interbreeding, despite their distinct morphological and genotypical differences resulting from their evolutionary divergent paths caused by geographical isolation. Unfortunately, this is not the case for other close relatives who are no longer capable of interbreeding, despite having a common ancestor. Marsupials are fascinating creatures. They are one of three different mammal sub-classes( do you know what the other two are?) and are found almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere( with most in Australia). In fact, of the other two sub-classes of mammals, one exists only in Australia, while there is only one example of the other sub-class which is indigenous to Australia, despite that sub-class being the most common in the world. Evolution is a fascinating thing, do n't you think? <p> And monkey 's uncle huh? Nope -- but I am an ape and so are my nephews and nieces. So I guess that makes me an ape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject, you would know the difference between a monkey and an ape. <p> Oh -- and you forgot hippopotami, which is one of the biggest killers of people in Africa. None of those herbivores tend to eat people though. See if you can tell me which animal is the biggest killer of humans( hint -- it is neither a herbivore or a carnivore). <p> Wow <p> November 2, 2012 <p> You 've still neglected to say whether this : <p> " if you go out and kill 50 people and eat their flesh why should you be viewed different than a crocodile or lion that would do the same thing? " <p> is something you think would or would not happen. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Not sure what animal is the biggest killer of people. Never given it much thought. My guess would be big cats or bears, but I really do not know and could care less. <p> Apes and monkeys are similar, but are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical characteristics, but they lack a soul like humans do. They lack being accountable to their creator. <p> No evolution is not wonderful. Evolution is a lie. <p> Sure there are different species or " kinds " of marsupials. A wolf, a coyote, and a cocker spanial are all the same " kind " of animal derived from a canine. Now, canines will nevr be anything other than canines. They will never grow scales, become cold blooded, and become cave dwelling creatures who hunt by sound. Evolution is impossible. You can not turn one animal into a different kind of animal altogether over time. Now speciation changes and branches of that information break off to fom new species, but all those species are still exactly the same " kind " of animal and always will be. There is no way for nature to change the DNA of a monkey to form a man. That is impossible. There is no way for nature to change the DNA of a reptile into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; marsupials, birds, fish, and man were al created as seperate and distinct creatures in a short period of time. <p> Evolution does not exist no matter how many bearded old men get angry at the fact that half the population does not believe them. <p> I am glad you consider yourself an ape. Now go pick some lice and swing around in, a tree like one. I am man, CREATED in the image of God, not ape. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Oh, and for the record. I love animals. Especially with gravy. <p> mandas <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Ahhhhh -- IC has been watching Kent Hovind videos on youtube. You should always reveal your sources IC. That way we can deal with the original idiot, instead of the mindless parrot. <p> Evolution is a lie huh? But you said speciation occurs. You do know what the definition of evolution is, right? And you might want to read up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns into another ' kind ' and can no longer breed with others of it 's ' kind '. <p> Education is a wonderful thing. Pity you never got one. <p> mandas <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Oh, and for the record, I have always wondered why an all powerful deity would create a creature in it 's own image, but put so many flaws, unecessary parts, and limitations in it 's creation. Are you saying that your deity is similarly limited, or that it made a few mistakes in the creation process, or deliberately put flaws in it 's creation( and hence did not create it in it 's own image)? <p> Is your god flawed, a liar, or malicious? <p> Richard Simons <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Evolution is impossible. You can not turn one animal into a different kind of animal altogether over time. <p> Yet it has been seen to happen( check out Helacyton). Most people who do not accept the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. Can you? <p> I am man, CREATED in the image of God, not ape. <p> I 've always been puzzled by this. Why does God need a belly button and why did we get a non-working gene for vitamin C production? Bit of sloppy workmanship there, was n't there? <p> You suggested "... the next few years... " and I 've proposed 5 years exactly as the period. Like you I 'm disinclined to wait longer, but anything less is hardly a scientific/statistical test of a trend, is it? If you beg to differ, please explain with reference to statistical conventions why you do so. <p> You referred to a "... new arctic sea ice minimum... " and I have proposed PIOMAS Arctic sea ice as the measure. It 's the most objective quantification of the amount of ice, after all. Again, if you disagree, please present a scientific case explaining why. Further, I 've given you a huge advantage by not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion) of 3.3 thousand km3, but by proposing that it will actually fall below 2.0 thousand km3 within the period I propose. In other words, I 'm giving you a 1.3 thousand km3 headstart. That 's 40% of the current record minimum set a month or so ago. Ca n't be fairer than that, short of just giving you the money. <p> So, when do we start collecting the gold for holding by a third party, in accordance with my terms in the link above? <p> Wow <p> November 2, 2012 <p> Still avoiding why you ask someone else if a human killing and eating the flesh of 50 people should be viewed differently or the same as an animal that does so. <p> mandas <p> November 3, 2012 <p> " Why does God need a belly button and why did we get a non-working gene for vitamin C production? Bit of sloppy workmanship there, was n't there? " <p> I think it 's far worse than that Richard. You would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - only two arms and two legs. ten fingers and toes. - two eyes with a very restricted field of vision, only a very limited detectable range in the electromagnetic spectrum( ca n't see infra-red or ultra-violet light for example, and certainly ca n't detect x-rays or microwave radiation), no night vision and a blind spot where the optic nerve meets the retina. - can only detect sound from about 20 -- 16,000 Hz, - no sensors capable of detecting electric or magnetic fields. - vestigial organs such as the appendix - hair which is denser in places which are more susceptible to heat loss, but sparse in other places - sweat glands for thermoregulation - pain receptors( how can an all powerful deity experience pain? -- sounds pretty weak to me) - expandable lungs for gaseous respiration - 32 teeth for chewing food -- some of which being surplus to requirements and only cause trouble( wisdom teeth) - separate tubes for food and gaseous exhange - an anus to allow the excretion of surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who or what?) <p> I could go on and on, but anyone with the ability to think would get the picture. If we are created in the image of IC 's god -- it is a pretty piss-weak god. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 3, 2012 <p> Richard Simmons, <p> Why no gene for Vitamin C production eh? Are you serious? If Adam and Eve had not sinned, they would still be young and alive today. When man was first created, he was an eternal being. There was no sickness or death. So God 's craftmanship was pretty great. However, man sinned and God cursed man with death and sickness. We were a perfect race of beng incapable of dying, impervious to disease, and eternally young in the beginning. You really should stop doing so many aerobics and read Genesis more often. As for your helacyton gartleri story, nice try. So if evolution is right, this blob of cancer is going to one day become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that SIN results in death. Now if sin had never entered the world back in Genesis, cancer would not exist for this blob to have formed in the first place. Besides, so called scientists say that it has been chnaging for the past 50 years. Ok, but it remains still a cancerous blob of tissue, nothing more. It is not going to turn into a 20 stoy tall killer alien with superhuman intelliegence of anything. In 999 trillion millennia it will still be a blob of cancer tissue taken from a woman. it can not turn itself into anything else. <p> Mandas, read what I just told aerobics television instructor Richard Simmons there. We were created in His image becuase that is what He chose to do. However, were are still lower in rank than the angels, except for the fallen ones in wich those of us who are saved are higher than they are in rank. <p> WOW, <p> Yes a human killing and ating the flesh of other humans is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals. We are man, CREATED in the image of God instructed NOT to kill each other. Animals have such instructions and are not accountable to their creator becuase they have no soul and are not godlike beings. <p> There was a group of " scientists " who one day got tired of God. They thought they knew everything that man could learn from the universe and so one day that had a meeting to discuss telling God that they no longer needed Him. <p> So, they all met with God and flat out told him that they could make man even better than He had made in the beginning. God accepted their challenge gladly but laid down only one rule, " You have to make man EXACTLY " the same wya that I made him in the beginning " He exclaimed. <p> " DEAL! " exclaimed the group of scientists. So as one of the scientists reached down to grab a handful of dirt, God suddenly shouted " NO NO NO! Your make your own dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So we are a perfect race, incapable of dying, and if Adam and Eve could n't get sick or die, why did they have an immune system? Why did they need to eat, drink or breathe? Surely if they could n't die, they could go without food, water or air and be perfectly healthy? And if they would remain forever young and could n't die, surely the world would get a little crowded with all those people being born from being fruitful and multiplying, Indeed, what is the purpose of reproduction if there is no death? <p> Perhaps you should stop just reading genesis, and give a few seconds thought to what it is saying. <p> On the subject of Genesis, what was created first -- humans or plants and other animals? <p> Richard Simons <p> November 3, 2012 <p> So if evolution is right, this blob of cancer is going to one day become an intelligent being right? <p> No. This one sentence demonstrates that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theory of Evolution. Besides, it is not just a blob of cancer. You seem to have paid no more attention to a description of Helacyton than you did to the spelling of my name. Or is that your idea of humour? If so, that too belongs back in the school playground. <p> BTW : We 've all heard that anecdote many times. It is stupid. <p> Jan <p> November 3, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> your fundamental flaw is that you take the bible literally. Absolutely hilarious! <p> How can you be so blind to reality as to believe what the bible says about the beginning of the universe? <p> Read the first chapter of genesis carefully. Then you will see for yourself that the account of full of logical blunders and stark contradictions. <p> If you take that nonsense for real, you will believe anything within your religion and dismiss everything that your religious leaders tell you not to accept. And that 's the whole idea : gather a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money. Alot of self-proclaimed " spiritual leaders " in your country make a good living out of people like you. <p> Wow <p> November 3, 2012 <p> " WOW, <p> Yes a human killing and ating the flesh of other humans is different from an animal doing it. " <p> In what way? This : <p> " We are NOT animals. " <p> certainly is n't it. How is it different? A lion eating 50 people is different from a pack of hyenas eating 50 people because one is a lion and one is a group of hyenas. So saying that the difference between us eating people and animals eating people can not be just " because we 're a different species ". <p> And your next sentence begs the question : where do you get the idea we 're created? <p> RCC says that you are eating the flesh and blood( literally) of Jesus Christ in communion. Indeed it is from the literal word of the bible he appears in that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Talking of which, there were many races who were cannibals. <p> So it happens. <p> But why do you blather on and on about caniballism? Secret passion of yours? <p> Wow <p> November 3, 2012 <p> " instructed NOT to kill each other " <p> Exodus 32:27 Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side... and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 4, 2012 <p> Communion is symbolic of Christ 's broekn body. His sacrifice for us. Apparently you have never listend through preaching r have never been to church at all. If you dd go did n't pay much attention and now you get it all wrong. <p> I get the idea that we were created from the fact that were were created as Genesis said we were. if were not created, then please explain in specific details how life began. Strt before the big band and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in very specific detail how every germ was formed and every living organism throughout the vast universe just appeared all by itself from nothing. This I have to hear... <p> Jan, <p> If I were you I would lay off the whole " gather a number of gullible people around you and then make them part with their money. Alot of self-proclaimed " spiritual leaders " in your country make a good living out of people like you. " that you said. Seems like you are one of the gullibel people who believe in man made-up climate change. You know, quite a few of your false prophet leaders like Al Gore have profited very well from people like you. <p> Mandas, <p> Ah, the old population control gambit game. I love it. You should apply for a job in the UN making sure people have only one child and that mandatory abortion and sterilization is enacted.To heck wth freedom. it 's over rated right? Too many people eh? Angels have not physical bodies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not hunger or get sick, yet the Bible says that heaven has plenty of fresh water, fruit, and all kinds of food. DEATH, sickness, and disease is a curse upon man as a result of sin. There was no death or sickness on earth before that event. <p> Richard Simmons, <p> So, you do admit that evolution is a mere theory? It seems like I have got the best of you when you resort to the school playground analysis. Changing from one living thing completely into another IS the theory of evolution. Gigantic terrible lizards turning into tiny birds over time? How is THAT not the same thing? Impossible. <p> Jan <p> November 4, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " So, you do admit that evolution is a mere theory? " <p> A MERE theory? <p> Blake Hensley <p> November 4, 2012 <p> Not sure who this character is, but I think evolution passed his kind by a long time ago. He is a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> A MERE theory? <p> So you admit that you have n't got the foggiest idea of what the word theory means in science! <p> A theory is a the best possible explanation for observed facts and incorporates the whole body of evidence. <p> A MERE theory is an oxymoron and this expression is typically used by people who do n't know what they are talking about. <p> " Angels have not physical bodies. " <p> Are you an expert on angels? Where have you got your " knowledge " from? Angels not only do not have physical bodies, they have no existence at all. Angels are a mere product of fantasy. <p> " His sacrifice for us. " <p> This one really beats me. Are you serious. You are saying as much as that the " holy trinity " committed suicide in one of its forms so it could forgive people for original sin, committed by Adam and Eve -- characters that never actually lived? How mad is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " really wanted to forgive people, could " he " not ist have forgiven them? <p> Why did " he " have to have one third of his entity destroyed so people could be rid of their sins? When you really think about that, do n't you see for yourself that it does not make the tiniest bit of sense? <p> The real story is the other way around : a wandering priest was crucified justlike thousands of other people before and after him and his followers then made up a whole bunch of stories of what a miraculous person he had been and why it was part of a heavenly plan that he had to end his life on the cross. <p> The real Jesus -- if he existed at all -- never performed any miracles. What the younger books of the bible say about them are all yarns invented long after his death in order to glamourise him and trick people into believing in him. That 's all there is to it and all that ever will be to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about Global Warming? You are totally ignorant of things scientific as you proved beyond any doubt by your silly use of the word " theory ". Who are you to judge other people who have formed an opinion on a scientific issue that is based on observable facts? <p> Climate change is real and it is to a good deal caused by us human beings. <p> Climate denial is also real and fact is that climate deniers are either extremely stupid and gullible or have their pockets lined by th energy industry. Not difficult to guess which group you belong to. <p> Blake Hensley <p> November 4, 2012 <p> Yes Jan, a MERE theory. Only a man made idea. A very poor one at that. <p> " I get the idea that we were created from the fact that were were created as Genesis said we were " <p> Which version? There are two incompatible versions there. <p> There are also the people of Nod and there 's also the women Cain and Abel married who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that the book does n't explain how you got created. It just says it is. <p> Well, if you 're going to believe a book, then believe on on Evolutionary Biology. <p> Wow <p> November 4, 2012 <p> " and every living organism throughout the vast universe just appeared all by itself from nothing. This I have to hear... " <p> You do n't ask your bible to give you that detail. <p> Wow <p> November 4, 2012 <p> " So, you do admit that evolution is a mere theory? " <p> Gravity is a theory. <p> Go jump off a tall building. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 4, 2012 <p> I prefer not to jump off of tall buildings. The fall will not kill you, the sudden stop will. <p> Graviton are a theory too. String theory anyone? <p> I will never believe in evolutionary biology becuase it is a false science preached by false teachers. <p> We might as well end this discussion becuase you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is, until judgement day when you stand before Him and have to give an account of yourself and your beliefs. And I will never believe in your evolution or man made-up climate change/population control schemes. I do not think either side is getting anywhere here. You will never convince me of your false science and I will never convince you of creation. So why bother? <p> Wow <p> November 4, 2012 <p> " The fall will not kill you, the sudden stop will. " <p> The fall is from gravity, which is only a theory. <p> But, no, you 're a chickenshit. Buck buck buck bkaaawk! <p> Your god does n't exist and you know it, so are trying to hold of the crapping fear by being an arsehole. <p> Richard Simons <p> November 4, 2012 <p> IC : You have come up with another comment consisting of a mishmash of garbled nonsense. <p> Please explain in very specific detail how every germ was formed and every living organism throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will, once you have described how to drive from New York to San Fransisco, including the pressure applied to the accelerator and brake at all times and the exact angle through with the steering has to be turned. <p>... your false prophet leaders like Al Gore... <p> I 've asked denialists before and never had an answer, so I 'll ask you. Why do you have a fixation on Al Gore? By the time Al Gore graduated from college, I 'd seen enough evidence to convince me that global warming was very likely. Gore is not a leader in climate change. He is a follower of science and an effective publicist but has never contributed to the science of the subject. <p> So, you do admit that evolution is a mere theory? <p> Virtually every sentence you write confirms that you know essentially nothing of science. A theory is a well-tested explanation for a body of facts and observations, that enables predictions to be made. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living thing completely into another IS the theory of evolution. <p> Wrong. What you described, with some clarification, might pass as the most elementary description possible of evolution, but it is emphatically not a theory, which describes how populations of organisms change over time. BTW, in fact, there have been several theories of evolution, with the one now commonly called ' the Theory of Evolution ' owing its genesis to the thoughts of Darwin and Wallace. Darwin 's grandfather and Lamarck both produced earlier theories of evolution. <p> Gigantic terrible lizards turning into tiny birds over time? How is THAT not the same thing? Impossible. <p> Why? How does an organism know that it has diverged as far as is permitted from the stock type and that it must change no further? Could you give an example of a couple of stock types with the limits to the variation that is permitted? <p> Richard Simons <p> November 4, 2012 <p> We might as well end this discussion becuase you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief in God to do with an acceptance of the theory of evolution? There are many Christians( and people of other faiths) who accept both. Check out the views of the RC and Anglican churches, for example. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 4, 2012 <p> What has a belief in God to do with an acceptance of the theory of evolution? <p> You are kidding I hope. Why would anyone choose to worship a God who can not speak things into existence? Those so called churches you speak of have a name. They are apostates. There are also churches that accept homosexuality as normal when the Bible clearly teaches that it is a sin. They might as well endorse adultery, murder, and greed as normal too. <p> Al Gore is the official spokesperson for man made-up climate change. he profits from it and passes his pagan earth worship teachings on to others. Man made global climate change is a joke. Only God is control of climate. After all He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe into existance also has the power to control climate. <p> My God does exist. Unfortunately for you WOW, your God is satan and for that alone both of you will share the same lake of fire. You deny it now, but you will not deny it on judgement day. You will beg for mercy, but it will be too late. You will seek death, but you will be immortal and death will not come. Immortal and yet burned and tortured for all eternity becuase you choose to follow the path of evil. What a loss. <p> Richard Simons <p> November 4, 2012 <p> What has a belief in God to do with an acceptance of the theory of evolution? <p> You are kidding I hope. <p> I see you are as ignorant about religion as you are about science. <p> There are also churches that accept homosexuality as normal when the Bible clearly teaches that it is a sin. <p> It also teaches that eating lobster and cheeseburgers is a sin, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is OK). Are you pressing for these to be made illegal, too? <p> Al Gore is the official spokesperson for man made-up climate change. <p> Where did you find this rubbish? <p> After all He created it and i figure anyone who can speak the universe into existance also has the power to control climate. <p> To quote a favourite saying of creationists, ' How do you know. Were you there? ' All the evidence is that Genesis was dreamed up by a bunch of guys sitting around a campfire, taking a creation myth from upland goat herders and another from lowland marsh dwellers and smodging the two together, which is why Genesis contains two completely different stories of creation. <p> You will seek death, but you will be immortal and death will not come. Immortal and yet burned and tortured for all eternity becuase you choose to follow the path of evil. <p> And you consider this to be the will of a benevolent god? Only a mentally sick person could contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " I will never believe in evolutionary biology " <p> No one is ever asked to " believe " in evolution. It is not a matter of faith, rather it is the outcome of diligent and honest research. <p> The Question is, whether YOU are willing to accept the facts that are clearly there for everyone to be seen or whether YOU prefer to sacrifice honest thinking for the believe in an old book that is full of contradictions and outrageous crimes ordered by a jealous god, whose greatest fear is that people might not accept his authority and worship some of the other gods around. <p> " You will seek death, but you will be immortal and death will not come. Immortal and yet burned and tortured for all eternity becuase you choose to follow the path of evil. <p> YES! That sums it up nicely. You are wallowing in the idea that people who do not agree with your childish belief will suffer eternally while YOU and your ilk will experience never-ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right : those are the musings of a sick mind. <p> Wow <p> November 4, 2012 <p> Hell, IC is n't even able to accept the fact that his bible ca n't be the word of god. <p> Not just because his god does n't exist, but because it ca n't be written by the creator of the universe. <p> He 's now left without a place of " specialness " and had only value to himself from that religion. <p> Hence he 'll refuse to leave it. <p> His life has NOTHING ELSE in it. Pathetic. Is n't it. <p> Wow <p> November 4, 2012 <p> " Richard Simons is right : those are the musings of a sick mind. " <p> More, anything bad that happens to other people is " God 's Will " and is right, but anything bad that happens to him is bad and he wants a doctor/lawyer/government to make it all go away. <p> Jan <p> November 5, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> provided Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy, it 'll be interesting to see if those right-wing evangelists come to the conclusion that everybody who voted for Robme actually acted against the will of their god. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 5, 2012 <p> Richard, I am not mentally ill or defective. It will be too late for you when you realize how wrong you are. You can argue all you want but on judgement day, your arguments will no longer be an excuse and it will be too late. Evolution can neer be accepted by a real church. It can be accpeted by apostates. <p> Jan, <p> " musings of a sick mind "? Really. Please take that up with John who prophesied and wrote the book of revelelation and take it up with Jesus as well. I did not make it up, it was forteold centuries ago. If you don ; t like it don ; t take it up with me, I 'm only the messenger. <p> And what do you mean " if " Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually triumphs temporarily. Of course he is going to win. There is no way he will not win. <p> Romney is not my choice for president. I ca n't stand Obama and his pro muslim anti american rhetoric and his anti Biblical crap either. I am not sure exactly what he is. Is he atheist? Muslim? He says he is pro Israel, but that is just to get Jewish votes. His actions show otherwise. <p> Romney is a nut. I do not like him at all, but i have little choice other than to vote for him. It 's either the mormon big mouth or the muslim goofball for president. I guess I 'll vote mormon bigmouth. it 's the closest thing to a traditional American president we have to vote for at this time. <p> Jan <p> November 5, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " I guess I 'll vote mormon bigmouth.. <p> So you are going to vote against the will of your god? Did he not send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winning the election? Or is he no longer interested in the fate of " His own people "? <p> Do you think that the " creator of the universe " will forsake his most ardent adherers? Can you not trust him any longer? I thought you knew his plan. <p> Richard Simons <p> November 5, 2012 <p> Evolution can neer be accepted by a real church. It can be accpeted by apostates. <p> Aah! The ' no true Christians except those who agree with me ' argument. <p> I ca n't stand Obama and his pro muslim anti american rhetoric <p> Obama? Muslim? The president who has ordered illegal drone strikes that have killed hundreds of Muslim civilians in Pakistan? Anti-American? You truly are off your trolley. <p> It also teaches that eating lobster and cheeseburgers is a sin, as well as praying in public( but keeping slaves is OK). Are you pressing for these to be made illegal, too? <p> You did not answer this. Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you what you think about it? <p> BTW : Were Adam and Eve both created on the sixth day, after the animals, or was Adam created on the first day, then placed in the Garden of Eden created for him, followed by the animals and lastly by Eve? <p> Wow <p> November 5, 2012 <p> " Please take that up with John who prophesied and wrote the book of revelelation and take it up with Jesus as well. " <p> Neither existing, though, any more than Dumbledore or Gollum. <p> " I did not make it up, it was forteold centuries ago. " <p> You keep gloating over a fiction. <p> Inasnity : doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome. <p> Wow <p> November 5, 2012 <p> And was n't Adam offered the beasts to bugger first, but he did n't like the idea and God made Eve to give him an alternative to bestiality? <p> Does n't that mean bestiality was God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 5, 2012 <p> wow, i hope you are no pervert. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 5, 2012 <p> Kai, sounds like he is a pervert. Only liberals think like that. backwards and evil as always. <p> Jan, <p> Sandy was a hurricane. Looks like Al Gore, the father of man made-up global warming sent it. Perhaps Obama ordered HAARP to create it just in the nick of time? I do wonder how FEMA came up with so many RFID tags for al those displaced people so shortly, yet could not come up with bottled water that quickly for the same people. Perhaps tracking people is more important than feeding them? Aaron Dykes did a wonderful story about the RFID tags by FEMA today. <p> I doubt if it is the will of God to vote for a person who denies God exists in almost every platform he has performed on. He ignores the motto " In God We TRust ". He refuses to take part in any National Day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soledad cross scheme. So, why would God want someone who ignores him and defies him to be president? Perhaps it is the will of Allah for him to president eh? <p> Oh and for the record, msulims kill other muslims all the time. Sunni and Shite muslims do have wars with each other. Both have terror organizations, but sometimes ignore their differences and come together to fight against us instead. They when we leave, they go back to killing each other, so your argument fails about Obama and his drone strikes. besides the CIA runs most of those strikes, not the president. <p> It was funny that a texan shot a police drone down over the summer though. That was great. We will probably see alot more of that in the future as goverment monitors and tracks our every move. Some people will just not tolerate such acts of aggression and illegal spying. <p> Wow <p> November 5, 2012 <p> No, unlike Lot, I did n't get shagged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shag my mother( either that or there are a pile of humans that God did n't make. Or Cain and everyone else is a half-breed). <p> Look, just because your hero wanted people to shag animals does n't mean everyone you do n't like a pervert for not shagging animals like your God wanted. <p> Mostly because the bible is a work of fiction and your god does n't exist. <p> Christians kill all the time IC. Indeed two godbotherers started a war and think that it is fine because God will judge them if they 're wrong. <p> That 's how religion makes people do evil. <p> Jan <p> November 5, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " I doubt if it is the will of God to vote for a person who denies God exists in almost every platform he has performed on. " <p> Then why did your god send the hurricane that undoubtedly will help Obama win the election?( In less than 48 hours we will know the outcome.) <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was your god who helped him win, otherwise it would not have sent Sandy. <p> You said so yourself : " Man made global climate change is a joke. Only God is control of climate. " <p> Since climate is the sum of all weather over a longer period of time( normally 30 years), your god can only crontrol the climate by controlling the weather. Thus it must have been part of the plan to help Obama by sending Sandy( at least, according to your " logic "). <p> Obama wins -- &gt; your god helped him win. <p> If you do not vote for Obama, you will commit a sin against your god, because it clearly wants Obama to win. <p> Wow <p> November 5, 2012 <p> And if Obama does win, even if it was n't caused by the Hurricane, then it MUST be that God WANTS Obama as President of the USA. <p> Wow <p> November 5, 2012 <p> Heck, did n't God want Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> on second thought, you 're right. Whoever wins the election, it 's an act of god, or more precisely of IC 's god, because that probably differs from most other gods that people make up. <p> And whoever votes on the losing side, has diosobeyed that god 's will, thus has become a sinner. Simple logic. isn " t it? <p> I wonder f IC is aware that more and more people abandon his silly beliefs? On climate AND on religion! <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 6, 2012 <p> " Obama wins -- &gt; your god helped him win. " <p> My God also gave Satan PERMISSION to torture Job. Remember that story? That 's right. The demon who tells you about evolution and socialism is the same demon who has to get permission from his own creator in order to tempt you with your nonsense. Looks like My God is still in control after all. <p> Yes Jan, people are bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well. More and more apostates and non believers and more evil among men. They trade their faith for a lie and lose their soul to hellfire. And your point of these madmen who trade their faith and soul for material matters would be......? <p> Just becuase some business magazine prints stuff about man made-up global warming doe snot make it true. How many times has National Pornographic produces issues that deal with evolution. Does n't make it true! <p> If you really want to tie in the end times prophecies with modern day global warming paganism, I recommend the book called The Global Warming Deception by the late Grant Jeffrey. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 6, 2012 <p> Do n't worry Jan. I 'll just point my orgone blaster in your direction and you will melt. <p> Please do say yes -- my circumstances have been very fortunate of late, and I 'm keen to use ounces as the currency, rather than half ounces. <p> If you are compelled to decline my enthusiastic offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your reasons for doing so. Note -- I will cheerfully accept cowardice and blatherskittishness as valid reasons. I will also accept that such are an explicit admission that you know that you are wrong to deny human-caused climate change. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 6, 2012 <p> Tell me, Insufficient Combatant, does God want his priests to abuse helpless children on sacred ground, on church time? <p> Also, can you direct me to the evidence that demonstrates that prayer has any effect over randomness? <p> Please. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 6, 2012 <p> No one is wrong to deny man made-up global cooling, global warming, global climate change. Whatever the name you are calling it now. It does not exist. it is only used to fund global governance and for that alone everyone involved should be banished from civilization and forced to live naked in a tropical climate such as Siberia. <p> You really should read what Maurice L. Newman ha to say about this fraud that the left wing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Gore, and the EPA for fraud and defund all of them on their way to prison -- refferably in Yemen when they will not recieve a warm welcome of inviting accomodations. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 6, 2012 <p> What is it about fundamentalist religiosity and low intellect/poor education that seems to predispose folk to excessive aggression and belligerence, along with paranoid fantasies and a propensity from selfishness? Not to mention an overweening lack of discernment and an absence of any ability in critical analysis... <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 6, 2012 <p> What is it about fundamentalist left wingery that projects a vast inheritance of general propencity to the vast age of galactic nebulizor moon force protocol banana peels with evolving monkeys into professors and an enhanced image of Gorish perplexity to weather modification by evolved ape like creatures in a state of floridated bliss? <p> I can speak just like Bernard now. <p> Marco <p> November 6, 2012 <p> Guys, I can not believe you are still arguing with insufficient combatant. He 's referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into the conspiracy thinking, I am not surprised he 's also deep into religious nuttery. He needs it to be able to live with his paranoid delusions. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 6, 2012 <p> Marco. <p> Prisonplanet? <p> I had no idea that IC was so ill. <p> Your case rests. <p> kai <p> November 6, 2012 <p> the worst idiotic ill-mannered creationists in history are the low-intelligence agw church members because these stupids think they can create climate, hahahaha <p> Bernard J. <p> November 6, 2012 <p> I see that you 're still steadfastly avoiding my wager Kai <p> How does it feel to be a cowardly blatherskite? <p> kai <p> November 6, 2012 <p> bernard, i do n't know, but you certainly do, since you are a poor unermployed gambling addict without any serious background. what you completey misunderstand is that you as the poor underdog are not qualified to dictate any conditions. you can only get what is nicely given to you, not more. first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior means, since you are lacking this character quality completely. <p> Wow <p> November 6, 2012 <p> yup, kai knows nothing. <p> I wonder if this arsehole is whiney neil graig with a different jumper on. <p> Are you not only a snide little shite of about 12 years age, but a lying bastard too without any courage? <p> Yup, that seems about right. <p> Wow <p> November 6, 2012 <p> " My God also gave Satan PERMISSION to torture Job. " <p> Odd that. <p> So you admit that god is a nasty little shite in your fantasy book? <p> Bernard J. <p> November 6, 2012 <p> Kai. <p> I am fully and gainfully employed. <p> I have more tertiary qualifications than you have thumbs and toes. <p> I do not gamble. I 'm quite boring that way. <p> In fact my proferred wager with you is not a gamble for me, and you know this -- which is why you are so chicken-shit scared to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bet with you, and that gives me, Coby, and anyone else willing to call your bluff the right to dictate terms. Heck, I even gave you a huge headstart over your own original starting point. <p> And still you wriggle away like the yellow-bellied, lily-livered coward that you are. All talk and no action. <p> And as these are your defining characteristics, I willingly bow to your total superiority in this regard... <p> Jan <p> November 7, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> " " My God also gave Satan PERMISSION to torture Job. " <p> Odd that " <p> Yes, really queer, but at least IC admits that he has got his very own special god that differs from any other gods people believe in, and a very nasty one at that. <p> The story of Job has always puzzled me : The all-knowing Jahwe, who is supposed to know past, present AND future, engages in a wager with the devil. <p> A bit unfair, because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he kills dozens of people just for the sake of a wager! The REAL devil in the story is Yahwe, not satan. Job should have kicked him in the arse when he found out about the wager and so should everyone else who learns about the background of the story. <p> As Dawkins said : "... the most unpleasant character in all fiction... " <p> Insufficietn Combatant <p> November 7, 2012 <p> No kai, Bernard is a stupid canadian. He hates Prison Planet but loves the ever so truthful Huff and Puff Post and MSLSD with Chris the Crank Matthews.. <p> Jan, it was not a wager. Satan is evil and you are influenced by his minions. Dawkins was just another possum herder who sniffed to many possum holes and got high off the dung fumes. The most unpleasant character these days is Chris Matthews. The second most unpleasant is Dawkins for his hateful racist remarks. He was a racist and a fearmonger and probably a whoremonger as well. <p> Job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn Job against God. he tried every dity trick in the book from death of his family to serious illness, yet Job never turned his back on God. Satan lost. Eventually here on earth Job as blessed with far more than he had to start with includinga new family. Now in heaven he has both families and even more rewards for faithfulness. The fact is Satan had to actually ask permission to do these things which proves that he is not in control of anything and anyone who does not follow God is not in control as well. God also gave a warning unto Satan telling him that he could tempt Job in various ways, but he order Satan to not take Job 's life. Guess what? Old evil grin knew his place and obeyed. Eventually this character will be bound in shackles for 1000 years before being eternally tortured in a lake of fie with all those who also choose to rebel against their Creator -- that is, the same Creator Obama puposefully left out of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government, has the authority to give human rights. <p> Yes Marco, I read Grant Jeffrey. I realize he is above your level of comprehension, but those of us who understand how the universe works can relate to his work. Yes i read Prison Planet. The reason? Becuase other so called new netowrks refuse to cover real news. Though Fox does a pretty good job of it, but others suck at it. If you do n't like it do n't read it. You stick to your Fidel Castro newspapers and websites and I 'll stick to the ones run by free individual sovereign citizens. Huffington Post is a commie run site. Anything posted there should be immediately disqualified as news. Might as well be reading a Media Matter blog post. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 7, 2012 <p> Actually Dawkins is a rather unpleasant character himself. <p> Job was rewarded for his faithfulness and Satan will later be eternally tortured for his rebellion and those who follow him on ths earth will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, like many hateful liberals do not understand God or the Bible. The lack understanding of reward, obedience, faithfulness, and punishment. The same thing goes for economic issues. Reward and risk are non concepts to liberals. I wonder if they never punish their children we they do something wrong? <p> Bernard evidently lacks the intelligence( Candian?) to understand that the Huff and Puff post is not the only " news " website around. There are others out there. <p> Marco, do me a favor and go find Polo. <p> Jan <p> November 7, 2012 <p> Now with the election over, Kai is having fits and keeps banging his head on the wall, because his beloved Robme has lost. <p> As a European I am quite content with the outcome. Robme as president would have been a disaster not only for the overwhelming part of the US population but also for the rest of the world. <p> This world is too complex for religious nutcases like Robme, we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their ideology. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 7, 2012 <p> Bernard is a stupid canadian. <p> No, I 'm not. <p> But if I were, I 'd be proud of it. <p> I 'm still not sure whether you 're just a miserable poe, but it 's worth noting that it was the rantings of folk exactly like you that convinced me as a primary school boy that the Christian fundamentalist religion I 'd been taught from day dot had its head up its arse, and that science was a far superior rational avenue for understanding the world. You simply confirm for me that my seven year old self had it pegged from the start. <p> On the matter of science, how do you square the eternal damnation in lakes of fire with the second law of thermodynamics? I do n't care whether you 're just a poe or if you 're really a god-botherer, I am curious to watch the scotomatic Gordian knotting of your irrationalisation. <p> Wow <p> November 7, 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> Well if you define " unpleasant " as " wo n't let me browbeat people who do n't believe in my fairy tale ", I suppose. <p> But he 's never tortured someone for even one minute. <p> So a far far better person than your god figure. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 8, 2012 <p> Jan, <p> Not blinded by ideology? Seriously? Obumbles represents the european marxist ideology of evil. He is all for stealing people 's money to redistribute it to others. He is a for " carbon tax " and other silly superstitions hat deal with man made-up global warming schemes as well as gay so called " marriage " and a host of other issues he has got all wrong. Of course he won. Natually blacks would vote for him, so he had that demogrpahic in the bag without even campaigning for it. Next come latinos. Now traditionally latinos are catholic and usually vote against gay marriage issues and sometimes again abortion, yet they vote for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one out. Next come young people. Of course silly giggly little 18 year kids are going to vote for Obama becuase its the popular thing to do. many times young kids like the ones who voted yesterday will wake up when they enter the real world and by the time they turn 35, they look back on their life of liberalism and think WTF was I thinking. When I was in high school I was more liberal, but after college when I started life in the real world I woke up. I am now a full fledged neo con and proud of it. <p> The next election must have one thing. The church has to be present. I advocate that churches have to start firing ministers who water down their messages. We are losing youth becuase of watered down sermons. We need our churches to take the message of salvation and good versus evil serious enough that the minister in the pulpit will not regret stepping on toes and insulting people in the congregation. We are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down chruch stuff and return to the old ways of preaching and soul winning. During the next four years Republicans need to identify themselves with latinos. It is possible that Republicans can win the latino vote by a majority if we can get lationos to identify with us ona religious and moral level. Repulicans an latinos both see the same religious views and we need to capitalize on that fact and get the latinos to see the democratic party as the party of homosexual sin, fornication, drug abuse, lazy hippie lifestyles, pro drugs, and baby killers. We will need to get religious catholic latinos to see the democratic party as the opposition of Biblical morality. If the Baptists can team up with catholics and creationists can get involved, it and be done and we have four years to work on it. <p> Oh and the fact that you are european is not shocking. I just wish european policies would stay in europe and stay out of here. We are, or were at one time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to see how it goes. The only message I have to americans who love euorpean ideals so much is for them to pack up and move there and stop changing things for the worst. <p> I do not know where exactly you are, but the fact that Europe has abandoned God and accepted Islam is shocking and disturbing. A warning : Sharia law will come to europe and an all out jihad will happen if you continue down your path. Islamic extremists are acalling for a global caliphate and europe is first on the list. They are assmebling their one large middle eastern nation as we speak. They already have Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, and soon Syria. All they need are a few more leaders ousted and they can form one large Islamist caliphate country. Once thye have accomplished this eurpope will be helpless against their onslaught. Europe has no money and few troops and citizens have relatively no way of defending themselves due to euro gun grabber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time dawkins opened his mouth or went out into the public it was considered torture to some. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 8, 2012 <p> Sorry some nillweekd deleted me again. But then again, that 's to be expected by you kind of people. <p> Dawkins was an idiot. Just him ging into public was considered torture to many. <p> I do not have a God figure. He has commanded that figures and idols be destroyed. <p> coby <p> November 8, 2012 <p> No one has deleted anything you have written. <p> If you would stick to just one fake email address, you would not keep going into the moderation queue. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 8, 2012 <p> Sorry. I suffer from a loss of identity. Sometimes I transform into a 12 foot tall albino reptilian with wings. Then sometimes I am normal. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 8, 2012 <p> I suffer from a loss of identity. Sometimes I transform into a 12 foot tall albino reptilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given your bizarre paleolithic superstitions and red-neck bigotries I 'd say the closest that you ever approach to normal is when you transform into a 12 foot tall albino reptilian with wings. <p> Jan <p> November 8, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> your view of European political reality is grossly distorted. The European Union consists of 25 countries, each of them having an independent government, covering a wide range of the political spectrum, but none of them have an extremist stance( otherwise they coud n't be member countries). <p> Other than the USA no country is tolerated that is in fvour of capital punishment, that barbaric legacy of ancient despotism and of course " biblical thinking ". <p> If you and your ilk had your way, the USA would be marching straight back into the Dark Ages. <p> Your understanding of the real world is next to nothing, which is illustrated by your admission that you are a neo con( and pour of it). Neoconservatism is the most backward of all political idelogies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it that you are also a supporter of the Tea Party that bunch of political clowns who make your country the laughing stock of the rest of the democratic world. <p> You should not be proud, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, especially because of your religious extremism! <p> How dare you claim that you have " woken up to the real world ", when you believe such utter nonsense that the unsiverse is only a few thousand years old and that fictional characters like Adam and Eve were real people? <p> You have not woken up, you are still fast asleep in your preposterously perverted religious dream that keeps you from perceiving the world in all its beauty and possibilities. <p> kai <p> November 8, 2012 <p> jan, complete bullshit, as always with you <p> Wow <p> November 8, 2012 <p> Well said, Jan. <p> Wow <p> November 8, 2012 <p> I guess God wanted Obama to win, then. <p> Wow <p> November 8, 2012 <p> " Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was considered torture to some. " <p> Yes, fools say that to people who do n't put up with fools all the time. <p> He treats your fantasies with the scorn they deserve. <p> Because you have no sense of self, this is a constant harrowing pain for you. <p> Boo hoo, cry me a river, baby-boy. <p> Jan <p> November 8, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> since Kai does not agree with my giving IC an earful, I am convinced that he is also one of these religious idiots who think that creationism is the best explanation of the world around us. Just shows, how distant these dullards are from reality. <p> Kai is particularly unpleasnt because he combines extreme ignorance with a very foulmouthed diction. <p> Wow <p> November 8, 2012 <p> heh heh heh <p> he said " dicktion " <p> heh heh heh <p>( dropping to kai level) <p> Jan <p> November 8, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> "( dropping to kai level) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kai 's level means going down a very steep cliff. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 9, 2012 <p> Jan, <p> Yes I am a tea party conservaive and who gives a crap about what the rest of the uncivilized world thinks about it? We tea partiers are in the world but we are not world citizens, we are sovereign individuals who happen to agree on core issue that are being destroyed by evil satanic influences. There is no future in liberalism and sin and evil either unless you count the eternal lake of fire as apossible future scenario. Capital punishment? Seriously? So, I suppose the uropean method of dealing with criminals is to reward them? Give them room service and a warm glass of milk with cookies, maybe a nice porno magazine? Not here buddy. In some states if you commit a crime you actually get punished for that crime. If you do n't like it, move from that state. You should be ashamed of your self for your anti-religious left wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so far apart. It is DICKtators like Che the mass murderer and rapist, Castro, Chavez, Stalin, and others who really scare people. Now you are adopting those same policies and wonder why people give you a hard time. Also, you did NOT give me an earful. You do not have the intelligence or authority to do so. I am a sovereign individual. You do not have the authority to have any influence over me with left wing nuttery. What you say to me goes in one ear and right out the other without the slightest decrease in velocity or without ebing processed. You can say whatever you want. It will not do you any good. I will not conform to you, your New World Order, your global warming pagan cult, or anything or anyone else. I was created by God. I am sovereign man who rules over the creation given authority by the Cteator and you or anyone else on this planet or universe has any authority over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for the comment. next time I turn into a 12 foot tall reptilian with wing I will get in my flying saucer and abduct you and perform anal probing on you. It should be a service well like since you are pro gayism and sodomy. I guess that 's what we get when we let canadians ansd europeans infuence our culture. I would move except that the last free nation on earth to move to just got killed off by the same people who run all the other screwed up countries. Nowhere else to go. Well there is still Agartha, but due to cold weather, insufficient funds and a lack of group support, I will have most difficulty finding the place without getting captured or killed. Very few ever find it and half of those never make it back to tell the story. <p> WOW, <p> Yeah the feeling is mutual. I treat Dawkin 's wacked out drug inhalation fantasies the same way. I get it now. Evolution was n't dreamed up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got high or drunk he envisioned people as apes, confused it with reality, and the wrote a book about it that would be taken seriously for decades. By the way, darwin and his fancy childrens book is not longer valid or taken seriously by anyone but liberals. Sure there are some church members who sort of believe it, but they have n't woke up yet. That or their former years of being a liberal were spent getting high and saying " peace " so much that it fried their brain and they are now not able to recognize truth from fiction. Dawkins is a idiot. I wonder if he was canadian? Alot of missing brain cells there to be american. I wonder if he lived in a zone where fluoride was in the water? I have noticed that in larger cities where fluoride is in the water, liberalism abounds, but outside of theh fluoride zone, conservatives prevail. I wonder if there is a connection. I guess Ann Coulter was right. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEFY the UN, world governance, liberals, canadians, and the devil. Everything else I accept. Well, except hoot owl pie which tastes horrible. <p> Wow <p> November 9, 2012 <p> And your denial means nothing to reality. <p> Deny the car rushing down the street toward you and it wo n't give a shit. <p> PS your tinfoil hat needs replacing. New world order indeed...! <p> Jan <p> November 9, 2012 <p> @IC <p> " What you say to me goes in one ear and right out the other without the slightest decrease in velocity or without ebing processed. " <p> I 'm not suprised because there is nothing in between that could slow it down or even stop it for processing. <p> You know nothing at all, do you? <p> Just for your information : <p> Richard Dawkins is a British citzen and still alive and well( " WAS Canadian "?). <p> The ' A ' in AGW does not stand for " American " but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " American " Global is an oxymoron. Something that is American can not be global at the same time, but stupid people like you do not even understand their own language, let alone anything else. <p> kai <p> November 9, 2012 <p> wow and jan, did n't you really recognize how infinitely inferior you are regarding intelligence, wisdom, dignity, knowledge, culture and all other core values of a civilized citizen in comparison to IC <p> unfriendly regards <p> kai <p> Wow <p> November 9, 2012 <p> Remember, Jan, that IC is considered to be the same crackpot who calls EVERYONE who he claims wrong " a canadian ". <p> Nobody knows why. <p> Wow <p> November 9, 2012 <p> do n't worry, kai. <p> I 'll pray for you. <p> kai <p> November 9, 2012 <p> wow, like mandas you are on your way to hell, you primitive atheist without dignity and values <p> Wow <p> November 9, 2012 <p> I 'll pray very hard. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan <p> November 10, 2012 <p> @Wow, <p> " IC is considered to be the same crackpot who calls EVERYONE who he claims wrong " a canadian ". <p> Nobody knows why. <p> Well, maybe, he once met a Canadian whom he considered stupid by his own standards and now he not only thinks that ALL Canadians are stupid but also that everybody whom he believes to be stupid must be Canadian. <p> The way IC 's neurons work( provided he has got any at all that work, which is hard to imagine), he does not make a difference between people outside the USA. In his narrow universe they all seem to be Canadian. Same as everyone who does not share is ridiculous religious belief, is a madman on their way to hell. He does not even realise that hell is only a product of fantasy and does not exist in the real world. <p> Is n't it a shame that grown-ups like IC still cling to silly beliefs that even a child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shreds in seconds? <p> The only chance for him to keep escaping reality is to make himself immune to information that could shatter his silly, religiously distorted and rigid worldview. <p> It really shocks me over and over again, when I realise that some people( for goodness ' sake their number is slowly shrinking) in the face of all contrary evidence still believe that creationist BULLSHIT! <p> Wow <p> November 10, 2012 <p> Or met a canadian who said he was an idiot and then he just considered it " canadian " to be so rude to a redneck rube screaming " DIE YOU FAGGOT LEFTIE COMMIE NAZI WATERMELON! " to their face. <p> I mean, he was only being redneck. Not like he actually knew enough about what he said to think it an *insult*. <p> So rude of someone to tell him to shut the f up! He has the Freedom Of Speech! As long as he can shout everyone else down for being obviously Left of him. <p> Insufficient Combatant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met were stupid. If they did not have someone there to tell them what to do, they would have no idea what to do. <p> American global warming or anthorpogeneric or what ever. it 's all man made-up global warming. An imaginary scenario that could not even happen if you wanted it to. <p> Hell is a real place just like heaven. You are given achoice of which you will go to, but pagan earth worship of man made-up global warming and denying your creator is not exactly the best path away from hell. <p> So my denial of yoyur new world order means nothing. Maybe not to you, but to me and 53 percent of the rest of us it means a great deal. It means we do not have to " move forward "( or downhill in your case) for following the ways of the evil world. It means we can stay the same as we are now for all eternity. Why not? God never changes either. He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time some liberal in tv says the words " move forward " it makes me cringe. It 's almost like an engineering who redesigns something to make it " better " when in fact it is far worse. Seldom does change make anything " better ". Some changes are positive, but most end up makes us more miserablae and worse off than before. <p> Yes I believe in a literal creation. So what? darwin and his ape man fantasy tales is just a sideshow. He was a delusional beared turtle herder who kneweth not of what he spake. His ideas are the laughing stock of many conservatives. I will be a creationist now and 900 trillion millenia from now as well. There is no force on the earth r under the earth or above the earth or in the universe that will ever change that. You can preach germ infected slob knob ape to mud to monkey planets evolution all you want. I 'll put my fingers in my ears, smile real big, and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until your heathen pagan ways are decreased to null and void and you go away in anguish and desolate bliss. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 10, 2012 <p> After the depressing Tueday night election results, I have obtained a positive piece of election news froma usually lair source -- the Daily Kos, or Daily Gross, whichever you prefer. <p> Obama may have had his minions and slaves to send him back in for forty more years, but I learned of a stunning victory for right wing conservatives on that night that dwarfs our loss to Obama and his youth army. <p> Here it is straight from the left wing press daily kos : <p> 4,000 Georgians write in Charles Darwin against unopposed creationist candidate : You might remember tea partier Rep. Paul Broun, the know-nothing wackjob that represents Georgia 's 10th congressional district, which includes Athens, home of the University of Georgia, where science is actually taught. The candidate, who had no Democratic foe on the ballot, was videotaped in September saying evolution, embryology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pit of hell. " The 4,000 write-ins were not enough to put Darwin ahead, however. Broun got more than 209,000 votes. " <p> This fact alone gives me confort knowin that we one at least one important fight Tuesday night and that the Obama Youth Army still has no real standing south of the mason dixon line. Thank God for that and thank God for Rep. Paul Broun for standing up to the creeps and liars who peddle darwin turle herder fantasies. <p> Jan <p> November 10, 2012 <p> " Most canadians I have met were stupid. " <p> What? Even more stupid than yourself? <p> " Hell is a real place just like heaven. " <p> Yeah, just as real in the sense that neither does exist. People who still believe in heaven and hell belong to the Dark Ages. Why do n't you wake up to the present and to reality? <p> " His Darwin 's ideas are the laughing stock of many conservatives. " <p> Ignorant people like you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid to understand. <p> Which is the typical reaction of an ignorant twat : If you refuse to listen to the truth, you can continue to live in ignorant bliss. Learning is work, sometimes hard work, that is why you shun away from it. <p> " Obama Youth Army still has no real standing south of the mason dixon line. " <p> It has been known to the ouside world for along time that people south of this line are particularly stupid and backward. So your observation does not come as a surprise. <p> " Thank God for that and thank God for Rep. Paul Broun for standing up to the creeps and liars who peddle darwin turle herder fantasies. <p> Have you got any idea why your god favours the stupid? <p> And if your " almighty " god has any doing in this, then why did it not manage to get Obama voted out of office? <p> See, your worldview is all in shambles, it does not add up, you contradict yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only due to your inability to use your natives language properly. <p> Jan <p> November 10, 2012 <p> sorry, must be " native " language. <p> Wow <p> November 10, 2012 <p> IC, face it, either God wanted Obama to win or he does n't exist to influence the vote. <p> Wow <p> November 10, 2012 <p> " " Hell is a real place just like heaven. " <p> Yeah, just as real in the sense that neither does exist " <p> What about purgatory and limbo? The former was merely invented because otherwise there is no use in praying( or, more pertinently, paying churches to pray) for someone who has died. <p> Go on, point to heaven or hell. <p> I 'll point to lollipop land. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 10, 2012 <p> He 's a poe. <p> Just a really grubby one. <p> At least, I hope that he is -- otherwise he 's a seriously sick individual. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy of that old bearded turtle herder dawin. You still follow his failed fantasies as if they were true. You can say heaven or hell is not real and God is not real all you want. it changes nothing. <p> Yes we down here in normal land south of the union border consider people north of the mason dixon line a little backwards too. I mean, who else makes dressing with loaf bread for Pete 's sake? Down here we, for the msot part, have ignored european ideals and marxist ideal and the left wing establishment. We do alot of laughing at liberals down here becuase we find ther ideas funny, almost alien. They make no sense whatsoever. <p> Oh well. Looks like liberalism is here to stay, at least until judgement day anyway. At least we are 53 percent free of it down here and peope like Paul Broun can still win elections down here. I hope that never changes. <p> Jan <p> November 12, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words : you want to stay ignorant and stupid forever. <p> Just how stupid guys like Broun and his crony Todd Akin are, is clearly shown here : <p> " Dr Broun was speaking off the record to a large church group about his personal beliefs regarding religious issues. " <p> No intelligent person can take that unbelievable nonsense Broun and his ilk are spreading seriously. If you do, it just proves how darn stupid you are. <p> BTW, Broun claims to have evidence for a young Earth. How come he never produces any? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 13, 2012 <p> There is evidence for a oung eath and it has been produced. we need more politicians like Broun and less like Reid. <p> He was unopposed in his re election bid. Any takers who can tell me why the democrap party did not challengeMr. Broun since he happens to be so wrong? There was the 4000 turtle herder darwinists who wrote in the bearded turlte herders name, but was beat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the turtle herder darwin and his fantasy bedtime storiesa of apemen and fish lizards has a serious mental defect. <p> Yes Mr. Bround was speaking to a church group. You know the CHURCH who believes in creation and NOT evolution. <p> Wow <p> November 13, 2012 <p> No, there 's a lack of evidence you will accept of an older earth. <p> The only evidence for a young earth is " It is written in this book wot I says is right ". <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 13, 2012 <p> Same goes for old earth fantaisies as well. <p> There is no evidence of an old earth. The fossils you see is evidence for a global flood. So is the Grand Canyon, the Tetons, and a host of other objects and mountains in nature. <p> Jan <p> November 13, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " There is evidence for a oung eath and it has been produced <p> What you call " evidence " is utter BS. No one who is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years old. The evidence is there to see and test for everyone. Only people who want to deny reality say otherwise. <p> Have you ever seen a tree grow? It takes time, often hundreds of years. Layers of rock form much more slowly. But Earth bounds with whloe mountain ranges where you find thosands of these layers on top of each other. And waht is most striking, some of these layers can only have been deposited on the ocean floor, while other only on dry land. You find these sort of layers alternate, so the same piece of rock that today is a mountain thousands of feet high, once was ocean floor, then rose above sea level and a few millenia later was submerged again, thus taking millions of years to accumulate all the material that now forms its substance. <p> To claim that such a thing could have happened within a few days( the flood BS myth) is nonsense to the extreme! You must must the facts : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims apart from that bronze age book, where cattle herders thought up how the world around them might have come into existence. How wrong they were! <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 14, 2012 <p> Entire mountain ranges were formed rapidly due to one large land mass dividing at the time( and partial cause) of the global flood in Noah 's time. Same goes with the grand canyon. <p> Yes trees have rings? Your point would be? Some years have two growth rings or sometimes more, leaving your tree ring evidence as false. <p> Nothing you claims supports your darwin apeman fantasy book where the turtle herder thought up how the world around him might have come into existance. How wrong darwin was. <p> Jan <p> November 14, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> you really believe in that nonsense story about Noah ' flood? <p> Go to a zoo and ask any of the poeple working there what theyx think of that BS fairy tale that seven people can have looed after all the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel that could not even have been built with the equipment and tools of the time for over a year. <p> What about all those creatures who depend on a well-balanced evironment for their survival. How did fresh water fish survive that mixture of fresh and salt water that would have covered the Earth if the story was true, what about the salt water fish that had their surroundings dilugted whe masses of rain came pouring down? And so on, and so on. <p> No one who has the slightest knowledge of the natural world would take that primitve and extremely unlikely -- no impossible -- tale seriously. Only religious nuts, who believe anything that is in the old crappy book, buy that utter nonsense. <p> Sorry for being so blunt but it makes me mad when I must learn that even today there are people around that deny reality to such an extreme that they accept the impossible as eternal truth. <p> Incorrect. Some TREES have two growth rings or sometimes more -- and with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use more then one tree -- and that 's what you do -- you have a bunch of dates. Furthermore dendrochronology is in agreement with other dating methods. <p> JV <p> November 15, 2012 <p> " The fossils you see is evidence for a global flood. " <p> So why do we find different fossils in different strata? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 15, 2012 <p> Different strata? Layers eh? <p> Well, why do we find fossils at all? becuase these animals were rapidly buried in mud. How man animals just die and then fossilize? ZERO. They have to be rapidly buried usually alive to be fossilized and especially to be fossilized while they are stil eating. Fossils themselves are evidence of the global flood of Noah 's time. As far as your whole strat layers are concerned, you can have multiple layers of soil, mud, etc from a short single season flood. If that is pssoble, think of a flood that lasted 40 days and water that lasted 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship on. Now think of all the run off over the entire globe as things started to dry out and drain down. Trillions of animals and plants buried. <p> How did sharks survive fresh water and how did largemouth bass survive salt water? I do n't know and do n't care. I am quite sure that some species had to not survive eventually. I assume tha Creator who spoke the universe into existence could probably handle the small task of saving a few fish from salt inhalation. <p> Go to the zoo and ask a monkey feeder about the flood eh? Good idea. I will get right on that. I bet they know everything at the zoo. They should know everything. Afyer all, they do have conversations with the animals. Maybe the tigers could answer your questions. I 'll ask them and see what they say. Then again, I better ask the apes since you say they are related to you. I 'll ask them if any of them know you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. <p> November 15, 2012 <p> Insufficient compos mentis. <p> You really have no idea of science, nor of the psychological scotoma that your superstition inflicts, do you? <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 15, 2012 <p> No. I do not. Please enlighten me. <p> And... which " superstition " would that be? As I recal I have no superstitions. Black cats do not bother me and walking under a ladder I have no issues with. So, please enlighten me. I await your almighty, all knowing response. <p> I do have an idea of science. I work with science in the electrical engineering/RF field. It 's cant get much sciencier than RF, complex electrical circuits, and such. <p> However, I have never witnessed a complex circuit make itself. it had an intelligent designer. Please do explain your logic of life making itself over time. Please also explain exactly how much time is required for matter to form from the blackness of nothingnessand eventually create life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I await your all knowing answers. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 15, 2012 <p> Ah, further support for the Salem hypothesis. <p> How apposite. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 15, 2012 <p> Note sure who salem is, but you make my point. Either you are canadian and do not know any better or you seriously believe that matter formed from nothing on its ownand later came to life. And you tell me I live in a fantasy world? HA! <p> By the way, you never did do any explaining. I still await your answer if you really have one. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 15, 2012 <p> As I recal I have no superstitions. <p> You 're a young-earth fundamentalist creationist. You adhere to religious superstitions including the existence of supernatural beings and the intercession of supernatural influences in the operation of the physical universe -- both for which you have no evidence beyond a much-edited book written by tribesmen, **25;3905;TOOLONG priests, schizophrenics, politicians and sundry other folk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from someone who believes that Santa Claus rides a magic sleigh and drops down chimneys on one night of the year to deliver presents to hundreds of millions of children. The only difference is that you 're an adult who thinks that his sky fairy is real, and you smile smugly at others whom you think are missing your amazing insight. <p> Like I said -- psychological scotoma. <p> It 's cant get much sciencier than RF, complex electrical circuits, and such. <p> OK, so explain why your job is as sciencey as it gets. With examples to both your work and the work of other disciplines. <p> However, I have never witnessed a complex circuit make itself <p> Straw man. <p> Please do explain your logic of life making itself over time. <p> Oh, I could spend several chapters worth of typing to detail the best understanding of it to you, but I know that you would n't listen past the first sentence. <p> Also, there 's a logical fallacy in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know nothing, and hence a superstitious belief is an acceptable substitute. <p> Go ahead. Enlighten me. <p> Enlighten yourself -- let go of your fears of mortality and of humanity, and accept that you are clinging to what is nothing more than a prehistoric emotional crutch and a tool for social cohesion. Use logic, and the evidence of the physics of the world around you, physics that you claim to understand, and you will see that your beliefs only maintain integrity in your mind whilst you deny their inconsistencies and incompatibilities with the reality of the laws of nature. <p> JV <p> November 15, 2012 <p> " As far as your whole strat layers are concerned, you can have multiple layers of soil, mud, etc from a short single season flood. " <p> And why do we always find fossils of species A in stratum X and fossils of species B in stratum Y? <p> Jan <p> November 15, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " Go to the zoo and ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will get right on that. <p> Yes, please do. Ask them if they can imagine that a small bunch of eight people could be able to look after ALL the species of plants, animals, fungi, a. s. o. on a tiny vessel for more than a year. <p> The answers you will get will tear your silly belief to shreds : " No way! " <p> " How did sharks survive fresh water and how did largemouth bass survive salt water? I do n't know and do n't care. " <p> Yes, that explains it nicely. Whatever facts interfere with your misconceptions about the real world, are met with a shrug of your shoulders and nonchalantly brushed aside. What do you care, when your belief does not add up? What do you care when you wade hip-deep in contradictions? What do you care when you spread obvious lies to other people? <p> Fact is, you do not! You very well know that you are wrong but keep asserting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceiving hypocrite. <p> Wow <p> November 16, 2012 <p> " I do n't know and do n't care. " <p> And you do n't know and do n't care how evolution works. <p> Since not knowing and not caring means you accept the word, you accept evolution. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 16, 2012 <p> " You adhere to religious superstitions including the existence of supernatural beings and the intercession of supernatural influences in the operation of the physical universe "... <p> Yep. Except I just call Him Jesus instead of going into a frenzied excessive paragraphical tirade. <p> Fears? Mortality? Sky fairies? Well, Mr. Bernard J canadian let me let you in on a few secrets of the trade. <p> 1) Fear is common to all man. You yourself are so afraid of God that you use man made science to take the place of Him therefore creating a false idol. So, Sir, you do indeed worship a God -- the God you call " science ". it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol. It has no salvation qualities whatsoever. It can not bring back the dead. It is a false idol. let go of YOUR fears and let go of your man made science and embrace the whole picture. <p> 2) Mortality? Seriously? You actually think that when I die that is the end? NO! One day my body will be ressurrected and renewed as immortal -- perfect. Can your science ressurect a human from death and make it immortal? NOPE! Jesus willingly came here in order forus to have ETERNAL life -- a ressurection will occur some day and those who died who relied on Him will reign eternal with Him. Those who did not will be subjected to be punished with satan and his allies in a lake of fire for all eternity. So, Mr. Bernard J., there is no such thing as permanent mortality. <p> 3) While you brong up he subject of sky fairies, let me remind you that it is you wo worship little fairies who sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is just about as close to a sky fairy as you can get. <p> Jan : <p> I doubt seriuously if a zoo keeper has any answers whatsoever to give about Noah and the ark. Most of them probably do not even know what a boat is or what it is used for, but for your sake I will ask one the next time I go. I can ; t wait to see the look on theei faces when I ask them how Noah fit a T Rex on the ark and how he fed it without getting eaten. ALERT! I have the answer, but I doubt if zoo boy has the correct answer. Wan na hear it or should I let you figure it out? <p> Jan <p> November 16, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> I 'm quite eager to " learn " how a hypothetical Noah would have managed to feed a T Rex( by the way, what on, meat( where from?) or bananas( and again, where from? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food that animals eat for more than a year in edible condition? What about the Koalas, who depend on freshly picked eucayptus leaves?)? <p> But I 'm quite prepared to get another preposterous assertion from you instead of any sensible reply. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 16, 2012 <p> It 's like talking to a rock -- which is what happens when trolls are lit by the harsh rays of the sun. <p> 1) I 'm not Canadian. <p> 2) I 'm not living in fear of any god. <p> 3) Science is not my god. Science is simply the most efficient way to employ logic, data, and truth to understand the universe. <p> I was raised Christian, and I eschewed religiosity as a boy afte I saw in fundamentalists the mental contortions, the paradoxical thinkings, the refusals to understand, the ignorings of the truth, the lyings to selves and others, and the denial of the obvious -- amongst many other intellectual failings. <p> And " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind to the laws of physics -- as so many fundamentalist Christians are. <p> 4) " Eternal life "?

Miss me while I am away? <p> Just in civilisation for a couple of days so I thought I would catch up with the happenings. Just a request though -- please do n't be so hard on IC. It 's not his fault he is the way he is. <p> There are obviously systemic problems which allow children to grow up uneducated, so it is partly the fault of the US education system. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imprisoned for child abuse for what they did to his young mind -- filling it full of their own twisted fears. <p> Oh -- and just a point on evolution. I really can not understand why creationists have such an obsession with Charles Darwin. Darwin did not ' invent ' evolution. Darwin just developed a theory to explain why evolution occurs. And science has moved on in the last 150 years. There is n't a biologist in the world who still adheres to Darwin 's theory, just as there is n't a physicist in the world who thinks that Newton 's ideas explain how the universe works. I would like to suggest that creationists get with the times and try to criticise current scientific thinking, rather than focussing on 150 year old ideas. But then, when you base your whole world view on a 600 year old book that is a bad translation of a few 1,500 year old texts which are bad accounts of some 2,000 -- 4000 year old oral fables, what do you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard, <p> There is no such law of thermodynamics in a spiritual world. Besides this earth will be BURNED -- everything destroyed and replaced with a new Heaven and a new Earth. <p> The requirement for Heaven is simple -- be saved. Jesus came here to set right what went wrong in Eden and He willingly chose to die in our place so that we can have eternal life. <p> Baptism is not required to be saved. it is symbolic of an old sinful life being washed away and a new life beginning. Multiple " partners " as you call it was NEVER in the plans of God -- He CREATED one man and for that one man He created ONE WOMAN, not tow, not fity, and not another man. Multiple partners and same sex partners was NEVER the original plan of God. <p> Not sure how many people will be in heaven, but the New Jerusaelm as described in Reveleation is 1000 miles in all four directions. An enormous city. That is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rural areas. So, technically you could fit every person ever born there and still have room for several trillion more generations. Yes unborn babies have souls and one daythe people who took their lives will face those men and women face to fae and have to ive na account of their selfish actions. Zygotes? Uh, a repeat -- unborn babies have souls. A zygote is a baby. When coneption happens the soul is made. <p> Fairies sprinkling carbon dust to warm the earth is my version of your global warming God. Co2 is irrelevant. The last time Mount St Helens erupted it produced more CO2 than ever car and every factory ever made combined. nature produces far more carbon than man. Our carbon footprint is more like a grain of sand n the middle of the galaxy compared with the C) 2 that comes out of the planet through vents and volcanoes. So, yes your science is right. The earth is warming. But you are wrong. it will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it. I suppose the ice melting on mars is from too many martian driving SUVs or mining too much coal?

What about that religious rubbish you presented in your last posting? It 's all made up. There is no way of knowing anything about this. You believe in things that do not exist. <p> And you do have a sub-standard knowledge about how the bible originated. Bringing in " revelation " says it all. Not even believers -- provided they are not immune to reason -- accept that book as a valid part of the bible und admit that it was included just by accident. <p> " responsibility is with the parents " <p> Yes, it should be. Parents are responsible for their children getting the best education available. But home schooling parents abuse that responsibility by feeding their children all sorts of trash, trash that their silly minds believe to be " eternal truth ".

You have absolutely no mind for figures and your knowledge about such things is zero. You just parrot nonsense that you pick up from denier websites. <p> Funny to think that you criticise others because you believe they subject themselves to tyrants, when at the same time you follow the greatest tyrant imaginable, who is willing to destroy the lives of billions of people if they do not obey his orders : your biblical god.

In classing together distant unknown formations under one name ; in giving them a simultaneous origin, and in determining their date, not by the organic remains we had discovered, but by those we expected hypothetically hereafter to discover, in them ; we have given one more example of the passion with which the mind fastens upon general conclusions, and of the readiness with which it leaves the consideration of unconnected truths. ' " http : **35;3932;TOOLONG... <p> It seems that you and your silly beliefs about the " truth " of the flood are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and age. <p> BTW, the blog from which I quoted this is a good starting point for everyone who wants to test their knowledge of what really happened in the early history of Earth : <p> It was written by Alan Feuerbacher, also a former believer in the flood, who after intensive studies came to the unavoidable conclusion that he had been told a bunch of deliberate lies by those people who made him believe that silly story about Noah and his " loving " god 's wrath, that " almighty " being, who had no other means of controlling a few sinners but to destroy most of his wonderful " creation ". <p> Even for a much lesser being there would have been numerous even more effective ways of doing this. And let 's use a little logic again : considering that Sodom and Gomorrha and all the rest happened AFTER the flood, your god did a hell of a lousy job inflicting the flood on a few poor sinners, <p> A few more questions : Do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Noah( let 's assume for the sake of the argument that Noah is NOT a purely fictional character), ONLY Noah, his wife, sons and their wives were righteous people and ALL the others were wrotten sinners. What about the in-laws of Noah 's sons? If they brought up righteous and god-fearing daughters, could they have been so sinful that they also deserved death? <p> You see, the more you think about the flood legend the more absurd the whole thing becomes. Let 's face it : it does not at all add up and only people with a distorted mind will buy into that rubbish. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 17, 2012 <p> Kai : <p> bernard, jan, wow : your problem in this debate is that you completely lack any konwledge in the fields of general biology, molecular biology, molecular genetics, biochemistry, medicine, physiology, pschology, zoology, bacteriology, virology, phytology and other bioscences. hence you have zero basis for a competenz discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor non-performers. <p> Snigger.

If they do, how many on average per child? And if everyone lives for eternity, do you know how many decendants everyone will have even halfway* to the point? <p> Do you know what the final population of Heaven will be? <p> *Yes, that 's a trick question... <p> Bernard J. <p> November 17, 2012 <p>... how many on average per child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard : " What 's your experience?

If you do not know what that word means, please consult Merriam Webster. <p> Why don ; t amputees get their limbs back here? Uh, for the same reasons pancakes can not fly and frogs can not sing and dance. The question is silly. You say you support your science books, but fail to use that knowledge.

Explain to me how Isaiah predicted the coming of the Messiah and how he would arrive 800 years before it even happened. Ayone care to explain that? <p> Better yet explain this. John tells us roughly 2000 years ago that in the end time there would be an image of a woman riding a beast in a multi nation empire. Well, he was right.

Mandas, you should move to Cuba or China if you like making these thing illegal. You would fit right in with the rest of the tyrants and creeps. <p> IC wo n't see it of course, but it is obvious to everyone else. IC believes in freedom and democracy, and that parents should be free to choose how and what to teach their children -- as long as he agrees with what they teach. He believes that it is wrong to make the teaching of creationism illegal. But the teaching of communism -- well, that should definitely be illegal. <p> This is the perfect illustration of what is wrong with the fundie mind. They simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldview, which is probably why they are completely incapable of seeing the obvious contradictions in their book of fairy stories. <p> Fundies believe in frreedom -- but only if they agree with the philosophy that is being espoused. And fundies are christians -- they just do n't adhere to the principles of christianity. <p> There is an important parable in the bible about hypocrisy. In John 8:7, jesus speaks to men who are about to stone a woman for adultery, saying : <p> &lt;i " Let he who is without sin cast the first stone " <p> The lesson is obviously lost on IC, who does n't really know or understand what is in the bible anyway. I guess that is why he is such a hypocrite and liar. <p> Jan <p> November 18, 2012 <p> @IC, <p> " Explain to me how Isaiah predicted the coming of the Messiah " <p> A lie does not become true by repeating it. In fact, Isaiah did NOT predict anything of that kind, which is proven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messiah. <p> Iasaih only said as much that a young woman( NOT a virgin, that is a mistranslation of the septuaginta) would give birth to a boy and call him Immanuel. So what? The name is worng for a start and the rest is commonplace. <p> Fact is, there is not a single " prophecy " in the bible that can not be explained by shere coincidence, but for the vast majority of them it takes more than a twist to fit them to a later event. <p> Talking about twists, I take it that you are referring to Revelation 17:3 when you mention the womanon the beast. Let 's just see, what the text actually says : <p> " There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. " <p> Really impressive! Are you really suggesting that a woman on a " scarlet beast " with " seven heads and ten horns " bears any resemblance whatsoever to the mythical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous how religious cranks like you babble the most mind-boggling nonsense imaginable and still give the impression that you actually believe what you are saying. <p> There is not a single " prophecy " that withstands any scrutiny. The horoscope of any tabloid contains more prophecies come true than the silly book you believe in. <p> As for your assertions, they are just that : assertions. Anything you claim to " know " are just fantasies of a sick mind, at best parroted nonsense you picked up from other sick minds or clever frauds who exploits simple-minded folk like you. <p> mandas <p> November 18, 2012 <p> Jan <p> The reason there are so many predictions in the bible that have come true is because the bible was written after the events it describes. <p> It 's pretty easy to make a prediction after the event. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 18, 2012 <p> Why don ; t sic amputees get their limbs back here? <p> Straw man fallacy. <p> I did n't ask this question. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth not regenerating their amputations. The point is not about why amputations do not regenerate in humans on Earth, it 's about the regeneration of amputations in Heaven. <p> If there is such regeneration, one would assume that there is a physicality in Heaven. Which begs my previous questions -- where exactly is Heaven, and why do the current laws of physics not operate there? <p> Speaking of amputations... Do foreskins regenerate? Why? Did n't God want good Christians to remove these emcumbrances? Or will they be regenerated and circumsized at regular intervals for all eternity? If so, why? <p> Uh, for the same reasons pancakes can not fly and frogs can not sing and dance. <p> Wrong. This is the logical fallacy of false analogy. <p> The reasons for non-regeneration of amputations is very different from the reasons that " pancakes can not fly and frogs can not sing and dance ". <p> The question is silly. <p> If you 're referring to the question " Why don ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you asked it not me. And yes it is silly because it is, as I 've just indicated, a fallacy of logic. <p> You say you support your science books, but fail to use that knowledge. <p> No, I did not say that. I said that " science is simply the most efficient way to employ logic, data, and truth to understand the universe ". <p> You are the one who has on at least two previous separate occasions referred to " science books ", which is telling insofar as it indicates an apsect of your psychology where knowledge is simply something that is written. In fact real, operational knowledge is a much more sophisicated thing -- but your disinclination to understand this likely reflects an attempt, whether conscious or not, to place your single reference -- mythic book, albeit one containing useful cultural wisdom -- on the same footing as the vast body of human scientific endeavour. <p> This is the red herring logical fallacy of appealling to equality. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regrow our limbs should one get amputated. <p> So what? <p> This is largely the logical fallacy of argumentum ad antiquitam. If and when human understanding develops sufficiently that we can regenerate amputations, will God then evaporate in a puff of irrelevance? <p> When SIN entered into the world EVERYTHING in the world changed. Plants, animals, humans, etc. It all changed. Before sin, there was no death., There was no sickness. Bushes with thorns did not even exist. It was a perfect paradise. No shortage of water. No danger from " wild " animals since animals did not kill each other before sin. <p> What?! Are you serious?! <p> Did carnivores have only molars before human " sin "? Did raptors have blunt beaks and claws? Were cheetahs stumpy-legged, and did animals across taxa not have camouflage? How do box jellyies make a living? And sharks -- did they munch on seagrass and kelp. What about a tuna -- they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape before " sin "? How did Cordyceps reproduce? What did female mosquitoes drink with their mouthparts? For what did crustaceans such as lobsters and pistol shrimp use their claws? Were spiders fangless and webless? If plants did not have spines and chemical defences, what stopped them from being grazed to extinction? Did humans not have appendices and thymus glands and Peyers patches and spleens and tonsils and adenoids? <p> Was there no summer and winter before " sin "? If so, did God tip the planet by 23 degrees just to spite his creation? If there were no seasons, did animals not then migrate or have their adaptations for migration, and did hibernating animals not then hiberate or have adaptations for hibernation? Was deciduosity non-existent before " sin "? <p> Was death by breaking a neck from falling out of a tree impossible? Was death by drowning in that surfeit of water impossible? <p> As I have asked previously without answer, what is your evidence for your responses? And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate one wrong piece of fruit? <p> Even after the ressurection sic things will be this way again. We are told... <p> Yes, you are told, but by whom, and how did s/he know? Upon what evidence was this claim based? <p>... that the lion will lie down with the lamb and the lamb will not be harmed, etc. <p> So all of the adaptations to avoid predation and herbivory will once again disappear? Summer and winter will cease to exist? Immune systems will disapear, and death by accident will once again be impossible? <p> Oh, and if you really wnat sic me to bake your limp noodles, then how about explaining why hundreds of Biblical prophecies came true? <p> Because most prophecies were written after the events prophecied, or because both prophecy and event were written about after the times claimed for them, or because they describe in the first place non-existent events that were subsequently claimed to have occurred, or because the prophecies were so vague as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future. <p> Explain to me how Isaiah predicted the coming of the Messiah and how he would arrive 800 years before it even happened. Ayone care to explain that? <p> Better yet explain this. John tells us roughly 2000 years ago that in the end time there would be an image of a woman riding a beast in a multi nation empire. Well, he was right. The upcoming new Euro scheduled for May will have the image of a woman riding a beast. Unless your science books can predict future happening with precision and accuracy second to none, I will keep believing in my Bible. <p> And to repeat a previous point, science is much more than what is found in " science books ". <p> Further, science predicts far many more things than does the Bible, with far more detail and accuracy. Nothing in the Bible can not be easily explained by sledgehammer perception, or by post hoc documentation, or both. <p> Insufficient compos mentis, you are labouring under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a primal need to avoid the cognitive dissonance that your childish superstitions would otherwise bring to bear. <p> The only person you are convincing is yourself.

Take the existence of Koala bears( as mentioned previously), for instance. This really is a problem for flood geology. If Koala bears were present in the Ark, we would have to believe that they somehow managed to make it back to Australia, across thousands of miles without the only food source that they could eat, eucalyptus leaves. These trees did not exist anywhere outside Australia, so they would have had no food source. Also, we would expect to find Koala fossils all around the middle east if they originally existed there, which we do not. The only way this could be explained is if a couple of bears travelled all the way from Australia to Turkey just so that they could be saved, then travelled all the way back( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting. There are literally thousands &; thousands of issues like this that would have to be resolved before young earth flood geology could be made to work. <p> Also, there are literally hundreds of thousands of diseases which afflict humans( and animals). In order for these diseases to exist now, they would ALL have had to exist on the Ark,( unless you are willing to posit a far higher rate of evolution than even the most ardent evolutionist). The denizens of the Ark would have had to be the sickliest bunch of people &; animals around. <p> These are the sorts of really serious issues with flood geology that people like you will have to address if you wish to be taken seriously, and if you do n't realise they are insurmountable, then you are not thinking hard enough. <p> ' Do n't know &; do n't care ' just does n't cut it. <p> JV <p> November 18, 2012 <p> " Explain to me how Isaiah predicted the coming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even happened.

" <p> Simply not true.... <p> Jan <p> November 18, 2012 <p> @Debunker, <p> it is really fascinating to see how the creationists make up " theory " after " theory " to " explain " all these riddles. <p> When asked about the distribution pattern of animals around the world some of them claim that prior to the flood there was only one continent which then broke apart and all the marsupials just happened to be on the part that later became Australia( just think of the enormous speed the continents must have had if they were to reach their present destination within the last 4000 years or so and how again they have to make up another unlikely " explanation " as to what physical forces were at work for the continental drift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others claim that it was the descendants of Noah who took these animals with them( again, that leaves the question, why these people were so daft as to take all those poisonous animals and plants with them, and -- in the example of Australia -- " forgot " to take some of the more useful mammals like cattle, sheep and pigs with them. A. s. o., a. s.o. <p> There is no end to the problems that have to be " explained " away if they ernestly uphold that nonsense about Noah 's flood. <p> The sad thing is, there is little point in arguing with these people, because they are absolutely immune to reason, facts and logic, but ridiculing them is so much fun! <p> P.S. : One of my favourites : " God is very fond of whales, because each time a species became extinct he created a new one. " But following that logic, god is much fonder of beetles! <p> Bernard J. <p> November 18, 2012 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he is so invested in pushing the fundamentalist line that he 'd have to be a very diligent poe indeed. <p> And that reveals its own psychological peculiarity, therefore whichever is the truth -- poe or fundie -- IC is carrying around some serious intellectual maladjustment. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 19, 2012 <p> JV, <p> Simply not true? Wjat is this, ignore the news day or something? The new Euro is going to have an image of a woman riding a beast on it. That fact is not up for debate. Come may, I 'll get some new Euro currency and send it to you and let you see it for yourself if you refuse to believe it that much. Yes Isaiah DID predict the coming messiah and so did the Psalmnist David. You are ignoring these things becuase you now I am right. <p> This whole post and all its comment are a testament to one of teh predictions of the end times -- men shall call good things evil and evil things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all backwards calling socialism bad and commuism good. Adultery and sin good and family values bad. That 's right, all you people fit right in that little prediction about backwardsness in the end times. <p> Debunker, <p> Thousands of diseases? Hardly. Disease has progressed over the years. There would not have been as many diseases then as there are now. We wnet from Eden where there was no such thing as disease until sin entered to now when we are plagued with one disease after another. Some man made. Men spend longer underwater in submarines than Noah and his family and the animals did on the ark. Somehow those men seem to make it just fine on their food, etc. <p> Mlax, <p> Seriously? CO2 is a joke. There is no man made global warming. Get over it. Industry in Heaven? I am not sure of that. The heaven that exists now is not the heavne that will be someday. The earth and heaven that exists now will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created later after the Judgement. <p> If we are going to be like the angels of Jesus why would industry need to occur? I am sure we will have some task or job to do. Even the amngels who are higher tan us have specific tasks. Even the demons who have fallen away from God who were once loyal angels to Him still have tasks and jobs to do. Ever read the Lesser Key of Solomon or the Testamnet of Solomon? Some sicknesses are the job of certain demons whom I will not mention their name. Besides if there are 999 trillion people tripling the population every few years and fossil fule is be used there, what is your point? Global warming is a forwarned ancient pagan earth worship religion that has arisen once more. It does not exist. <p> yes, I agree. As for me, I will no longer respond to IC. He 's getting so much over the top, it would be a waste of time to deal with him any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, mandas. wow and other evolutionists : the problem i have in discusding with you the questions you are tackling here with IC is that you do n't have any sufficient background of the current state of science in the field of molecular genetics which would provide you with knowledge and wisdom that would trash most of the wrong speculation of Darwin and dependent traditional geneticists who have n't learned much from modern molecular biology <p> " Some man made. Men spend longer underwater in submarines than Noah and his family and the animals did on the ark. Somehow those men seem to make it just fine on their food, etc. " <p> Oh dear oh dear oh dear... How this answers my specific point about Koalas managing to find their way back to Australia after the flood without access to their only food, I do n't know ; but since you bring it up, those Koalas would also have had to be fed fresh eucalyptus leaves every day whilst on the ark. Where was Noah going to source that? Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a ton of vegetation every day! Where was Noah going to source a ton of vegetation a day to feed a pair of elephants?( plus 50 gallons of water each). <p> That 's if we accept Genesis 6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. <p> If we go with Genesis 7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. <p> Which is it to be? And you say the bible does n't have contradictions! Feeding seven pairs of elephants,( assuming elephants are clean, who knows?) just does n't bear thinking about.( oh, Noah would also have had to take Asian elephants too as they are different species, so the problem just compounds). <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered sub, with canned, high protein food, plus frozen food, technologies Noah would n't have had, just does n't even begin to be an answer. <p> Your God presumably went to a lot of effort to give you brains. He must be very disappointed that you are making so little attempt to using them <p> Wow <p> November 19, 2012 <p>( oh, Noah would also have had to take Asian elephants too as they are different species, so the problem just compounds) <p> And the pygmy elephant. <p> Debunker <p> November 20, 2012 <p> Thanks Wow, I was going to mention that but I did n't want to make things too difficult for him... Also, there are two species of African rhino, plus a couple of Asian ones, although they are just about extinct due to gullible Asians believing in their ' medicinal powers '. The horns are just keratin, they may as well grind up their own toe nails for all the good they will do... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true? Wjat is this, ignore the news day or something? The new Euro is going to have an image of a woman riding a beast on it. " <p> No, it 's not. Only if you interpret... hm... " a little ". <p> " Yes Isaiah DID predict the coming messiah " <p> No, he did n't. As I said : Read your bible. Isaiah wrote : " Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign : The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. " And in the original text there is no mention of " virgin " but " young woman ". Even more : The text referres to the clash of two kings -- both of them were already dead, when Jesus was born. <p> You have to read the whole passage -- not only the pieces which fit. <p> Insufficient Combatant <p> November 20, 2012 <p> Bernard J. <p> who said " Whether poe or genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, illiterate, superstition-hugging numpties such as IC, it wo n't be a very nice place to be. " <p> Uh... Ever hear of a fellow named Isaac Newton? Cotton Mather? James Parkinson? Jean Deluc? All men of science, and yet all men of God who believed in young earth creationism. I bet you never heard of Benjamin barton eh? The botanist who was also a young earth creationist? Look up John Kidd -- the founder of most modern uses for coal and so called fossil fuels -- another creationist. <p> Sir John William Dawson, the famous Geologist who also accepted ceatisonism. Charles Smyth, a famous astonomer who though that principles of the Bible should be taught in science. Look up Phillip H. Gosse and see what he believed. <p> Balfour Steward was the dicoverer of the ionosphere and Scottish physicist who once stated that there should be no conflict between the facts of science and the fundamentals of Christianity. <p> Bernard, what happened? I can name you at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as opponents to evolution. This modern stance that you have to be a left wing population control hippie communist atheist to be in the science field is a load of crap. Back in the day, REAL scientists knew that the world they studied was CREATED. That 's before the creeps crept into the science field and ruined it with monkey to man fairy tales and global warming money laundering schemes. No matter how many links you list, the fact remains that some people try to invent ways to get around God. So far, the whole thing has been an utter failure. Better luck next time. <p> Debunker, <p> Give it a rest. Many of the animals on the ark had to be very young adults or even infants in order to sustain them. If you had to take a T. Rex on baord, would you want two grown ups or two infants? Which would be easier to feed and handle? Besides. There were not as many species of animals on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koala 's were around yet.? The Koala is a KIND of animal. A species of another type of animal. For example. A wolf, coyote, fox, and poodle are different species of the ame KIND of animal -- the canine. The modern cow, buffalo, etc. is the same KIND of animal derived from a single source. Same thing with deer, moose, antelope, and elf. Same with lions, tigers, bobcats, housecats, etc. <p> The Bible states that Noah had two of each KIND of animal, not two of each species of animal. I also like your 50 gallons of water comment. Being that the one continent divided into seven and water spewed up between them from " the great deep " and it rained for forty days and forty nights, I am quit sure that having enough water was the least of their worries. All he needed was some barrels to collect the water in. Duh! <p> JV, <p> Isaiah and David both predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish to accomplish by arguing scripture, unless you are trying to get the war on Christmas re started all over again. You are not anti semitic are you? And yes the new Euro is going to have an image of a woman riding a beast. Did you not read the news? I am willing to bet that if I told you that concrete is hard, you would argue that it is soft. People like you just liek to argue I guess. It 's the only reasonable explaination to your arguing with 100 percent news facts. Like I said, let me know your address and I will send you one of the new Euro money peices with a woman riding a beast when it comes out in May. Perhpas when you see it for yourself you might believe. Then again, you probably believe Obama 's picture is on the 100 dollar bill and Goerge Washington was Darwin 's wing man. You are silly. <p> Bernard J. <p> November 20, 2012 <p> Insufficient compos mentis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago, and did not have the benefit of the detailed understanding of modern biology and geology -- and indeed of modern physics -- that we now have. They were raised( = indoctrinated) with the pervasive social religious superstitions of the day, and their more limited understanding of the universe left sufficient large gaps that it was a much more simple matter to avoid the conflict with their religious beliefs. Had many of them lived today, they would most likely have discarded their creationist beliefs in the face of scientific evidence, analysis and understanding. <p> This is not to say that some good scientists do not still hold religious beliefs. However, most who do are not creationist, and of those who are there is almost always a significant psychological scotoma or fantastical rationalisation in action in order to avoid cognitive dissonance. <p> The simple fact is that once science is applied to the questions of origin of the universe and the phenomenon of life, a magical sky fairy is not required to ' explain ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from less sophisticated sociocultural and intellectual conditions. This is why religiosity and especially creationist fundamentalism is not widespread in scientific circles, especially outside the USA. <p> kai <p> November 20, 2012 <p> bernard said " This is why religiosity and especially creationist fundamentalism is not
