5206641 <h> CHALLENGE : Colombian Kitchens and the other ' C ' words <p> Strength is the capacity to break a chocolate bar into four pieces with your bare hands and then eat just one of the pieces - Judith Viorst. <p> So I have, in my chocolate-addicted state of mind, come to realise that the best thing about having chocolate in the house is not necessarily eating it, rather showing off to your friends just how much you have. <p> Seriously... no... wait... what is that? No... it ca n't be... <p> Santander Chocolate <p> This is a very common reaction I 've had in the last two weeks since purchasing quite possibly the largest block of chocolate I will ever own( please consider that a direct and hostile challenge to all who read this). <p> Not that I 'm one for sweeping generalisations, but Colombia really does has some pretty cool stuff. Some of that ' stuff ' it 's rather famous for, and ashamedly so. Any conversation had with a Colombian of the current generations will at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought social and political chaos in recent decades. Some of that other ' stuff ' Colombia is perhaps not so famous for. At the moment anyway. <p> But as Colombia moves forward and searches for ways to contribute to the global economy, it 's awfully lucky that it has an abundant supply of 2 things people will always come back for : coffee and chocolate. <p> I remember being back home at a wholefood sales outlet, staring at two sacks of coffee. Colombian or Brazilian. It 's a tough call when you 're 4000 miles away and the only truth you have to base your choice on is which group of students do I enjoy teaching the most? <p> I would now safely, without a doubt, opt for the Colombian variety. And with the choice at the supermarket being between a block of Lindt for 12,000 pesos, or a block of single origin Colombian made Santander for 4000 pesos, you can see how my substance abuse issues or not necessarily going to resolve themselves any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' C ' word challenge : how much for Colombia can I get into one dish? <p> I found a recipe a while back on Epicurious which seemed pretty tasty, and reports from friends of mine who tried it out were outstanding. My only issue was that the quantities did n't really suit what I had in mind. Either way, this still is a pretty intense experience, though not quite as full on as the One-bite-brownies I invented while in Singapore... but more on that at a later date. <p> Double Chocolate Mocha Fudge Brownies <p> Try this on for size <p> Melt 250g of chocolate( I 'm using 65%) over a bain-marie. It is always best to bring the water to boiling and then turn it off. Leaving it on the heat will burn the chocolate quickly. Just to give you an idea of the scale of chocolate I 'm dealing with... here 's one for all chocaholics out there. <p> Add 200g butter and melt. <p> Colombia : The other ' C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your grandma for Christmas <p> Mix in a generous pinch of three of salt and about 1 cup of sugar and some vanilla. Now as I 've mentioned in previous posts, I tend to use panela -- a raw sugar cane product that loosely resembles brown sugar and has a more interesting flavour profile than refined sugars. <p> Add 3-4 shots of freshly made espresso. Now the key here is to make it STRONG. The oils from the coffee will help the water to mix in seamlessly with the chocolate, as normally, chocolate and water mix together like kids and brocoli. I just so happened to have a bag of Jesus Martin 's coffee, from Salento, and the only place I 've ever actually needed to buy more than 2 coffees in one sitting in spite of a chronic case of the shits. It really was that good. <p> Once cool( if you remove from the steam once the butter is almost melted, and sit on a bench, it should cool to a useable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time. Fold in 1 cup of flour and 2-3 tablespoons of cocoa, sifted and a handful of chocolate chips. <p> Bake at 165 for 20 mins. It is ready when the top layer is solid and the edges just pull away from the side of the tray -- slightly undercooked is always better with brownies. <p> Double Chocolate Mocha Brownies.... Yes! <p> Let it cool before tipping it out. If you conveniently happen to have a plate of tray the same size as the brownies, you can carefully tip it out on to that -- being careful to not let the fresh nomnoms fall any distance, as they will break up, and then turn it back onto a chopping board or plate, so the baked, cracked side is not facing up. <p> And, as always, serve warm with lashings of something sweet. <p> Now, if any one can
