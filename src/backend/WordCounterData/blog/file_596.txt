5168041 <p> I need to buy new speakers for my computer and am wondering what the best speaker set-up(s) there are that are suitable for a computer desk( 3 ' x 5 ') around $100. From what I 've heard, from audiophiles, is that computer speakers are n't really worth the money. Is this true? Are there any good computer speakers and if so can someone recommend any? Or do you guys have any other ideas, preferably cheap? <p> Something else I 'm interested in : Extremely broad I know, what are the best value for money speakers out there? I guess if they 're tempting enough I 'll find a way to accomodate them. <p> Thanks a lot. <p> EDIT : I mainly listen to less-bass intensive music, so I 'm not looking for a great sub. Hopefully that can afford me better specs in the speakers themselves apart from the sub? <p> I need to buy new speakers for my computer and am wondering what the best speaker set-up(s) there are that are suitable for a computer desk( 3 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard, from audiophiles, is that computer speakers are n't really worth the money.

I really like the designs though so I 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also, do you know any good websites that are dedicated to selling speaker equipment? Preferably with ratings? <p> Like I said MS16 are decent. MS20 offers some improvements and builtin DAC if your soundcard onboard is bad( aka if the noise is clearly noticeable and annoying) <p> I 'm actually looking a the 16s now. They come in just under $100 and are located here( big positive). Am reading reviews and watching videos on the speakers at the moment. I have n't made my mind up at all yet but thanks for the steering. <p> EDIT : Yep, I 've oficially written it down on a piece of paper I place infront of my keyboard. I 'm gon na think about it for a few days but they 're definitely front runners. Great Amazon reviews too( sixteen of twenty-one reviews are
