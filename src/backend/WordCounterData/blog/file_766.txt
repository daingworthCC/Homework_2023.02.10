5185241 <h> In Advance Of The Retaliation : Gaza Missile Range Infographic <p> With Israel having launched the biggest Gaza escalation in years, the waiting game now turns to the Gaza retaliation, which if the rhetoric is any indication, will be substantial. So what can Gaza do, and how far can its rockets penetrate, assuming they can bypass the Israeli " Iron Dome " defense shield? The following infographic from Stratfor explains it. The ranging is particularly relevant in the context of the Dimona nuclear power plant, which at least at first blush appears unreachable - after all, if Gaza really wanted to unleash the gates of hell on Israel, it would focus all of its firepower precisely on this one spot. <p> Israel Defense Forces confirmed Nov. 14 that it had killed Ahmed Jabari, the leader of Hamas ' armed wing, the Izz al-Deen al-Qassam Brigades. The airstrike that killed Jabari came a day after Israel warned that it was considering targeted assassinations in response to increasing rocket fire from Gaza. In addition to the strike on Jabari, the Israeli air force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaza police station, and loud explosions are being reported in Gaza City. An IDF spokesman announced that the Israeli military was embarking on Operation Pillar of Defense, which could include a ground incursion into Gaza. The assassination of Jabari seems to have been a first salvo, one that will provoke retaliation from Hamas and that could affect Jordan and Syria. Renewed and expanded bouts of rocket fire are certain, including rockets targeting urban areas. But the question is what other operations Hamas can and will conduct. <p> So even assuming a missile can enter deep into Israel territory, the clip below shows the defensive chain of Israeli events that is unleashed next. <p> Let me guess.. wimpy libertarians are against a military intervention to protect our allies? Pathetic. Nerdy libertarian computer nerds and anti-war protesters are an embarrassment to average Americans and pose a serious diminishment to our national pride and sense of self-esteem. <p> All of Palestine that existed when the Romans called it Palestine still exists. The name Palestine has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation or country. That entire Palestinian region is still there, even tho the names of the countries/nations within that region have changed over time. <p> OK kids. Here is a homework assignment for everybody. Compare and contrast the political and economic characteristics of modern Gaza with the Jewish ghettos of Nazi occupied Poland between 1939 and 1942. How is life different or the same for a human being living in these environments. Oh sorry. The gatekeepers do n't think the residents are human beings. <p> Ignorant MDB, you suggest that because their skin is white they are our allies and if their skin is dark they must be terorrists, and need to be bombed, looted and force fed intravenous central banking... <p> Name 1 of the countries that have been devastated by our Military, that were not composed of people with skin pigment <p> Germany, Italy, Austria, just in the last century. Europeans are second to none in kicking each other 's asses, and America has been aligned with Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got to the point where all the fight had left us, so now we give a shit about the rest of the world. No doubt, that will change and we 'll be back at each other 's throats, and whatever intrigues Europeans have in the third world will go unnoticed except by intervening European or American navies. If Vietnam had occurred during WWII it would have been but a footnote in history, not an obsession of it. <p> The conflicts between the occidental world and the muslim world have deeper roots and violence than the superficial cold war. Israel, might not be completly in the occidental world( not christian, and not in America or Europe), yet they are the ennemy of our ennemy. Said differently, Israel is our friend. <p> Call me a zionist, but in a new world paradigm with the muslim and confucianism worlds getting more powerful every day as the occident decline, we must get along shoulder to shoulder with our allies. If Israel fall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the USA, but the Europe might be one day part of the ummah. <p> Leaving the USA alone, with all the resentment in the world against your world hegemony. Then, no one will be left to cry if you get wiped out of the map by an EMP. <p> Mr Bonus SIR : : It is so good to see that at least ONE other person here in ZERO-land LOVES Amercia and LOVES Jesus! My Preacher, Brother Billy Bob Barker, told me and The Faithful who was in Church where we belonged to be on Sunday that if we really LOVE Jesus we got ta KILL anyone who does n't LOVE Jesus as much as Jesus LOVES Amercia. " Kill ' em all and let God sort it out! " Amen. We got to DEFEND Israel because the Bible says so and if the Bible says so, I believe it, AND THAT SETTLES IT! Amen and PRAISE BE! This is SCRIPTURE TIMES! I say : Bring it on and Let 's ROLL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to git your woman into the kitchen to start makin cookies for the troops and gettin ' the house all clean and READY FOR RAPTURE! Let 's ROLL!!! <p> I assume you are being tongue-in-cheek and actually realize that the Bible says no such thing. <p> If the Bible is true, Jerusalem will eventually be conquered by the non-Jew and nobody but God will come to the rescue. That is the point, according to the Bible. When God alone rescues Israel, that will be proof indeed that God is God. Should be an interesting show to watch if it happens. <p> Oh wait... Jerusalem has already been conquered by the non-Jew a number of times. So is the Bible talking about that, or some other time in the future that has n't happened yet? <p> Hey MDB - why do n't you enlist in the military if you 're so pro-war. Maybe you could give lectures in the Middle East on why privately owned central banks are a necessity to any emerging economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimona nuclear power plant, which at least at first blush appears unreachable - after all, if Gaza really wanted to unleash the gates of hell on Israel, it would
