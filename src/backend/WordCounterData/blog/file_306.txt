5138841 <h> Monday, October 22, 2012 <h> Monday Motivation : Do Something Crazy <p> Since I 'm a writer, blogger and feminist it should come as no surprise that Julie &; Julia is one of my favorite films. I watched this great Nora Ephron movie Friday night and by the end my enthusiasm for blogging was renewed. I started thinking about Julie Powell and other bloggers who have been wildly popular and landed book deals because of their websites. The one thing these writers seem to have in common is that they were willing to do something crazy. Naysayers may call it a gimmick, and perhaps for some it is just that. But when I think about Julie Powell and women like Rachel Bertsche, author of the blog and book MWF Seeking BFF, they were all willing to do something that took courage and discipline, whether that was cooking 524 Julia Child recipes in 365 d ays or going on fifty-two friend-dates, one per week for a year, in hopes of meeting a new Best Friend Forever. And so I present a challenge. November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in November many of our ambitious fiction writer pals are busy with National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo. <p> So I thought, what if we bloggers had a project of our own for the month of November. <p> Inspired by Tarayi Jones ' #writelikecrazy, in which she encouraged writers to write every day for a month, I 've decided to launch #bloglikecrazy for the month of November. <p> Here 's the #bloglikecrazy challenge : publish a meaningful blog post every single day in November. That 's 30 posts in 30 days. <p> I 've tried to do this several times before and failed miserably. But I figure I 'd be a bit more motivated if I 'm actually leading this endeavor. <p> So are you with me? <p> Project #bloglikecrazy will begin Nov. 1. <p> Also, if you 'd like you can sign up for me to send you writing prompts throughout November to help get those creative juices flowing. Just email me at javacia@gmail.com with #bloglikecrazy in the subject line and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can #bloglikecrazy! " <p> So does this mean that after blogging for 30 days you 'll get a book deal? Probably not. But at the end of November you will be more dedicated to your blog and it 's dedication that will help you make your writing
