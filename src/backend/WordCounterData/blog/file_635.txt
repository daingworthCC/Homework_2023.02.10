I have recently realized that we ca n't always control where we are in life, but we can use our gifts anywhere God has planted us. <p> Just the other day I was washing dishes, when one of the glasses broke. I was forced to go to the emergency room to get stitches in my hand. Every ER visit usually follows the same type of pattern : They ask you a lot of questions, check out the problem and hopefully help you get back to some semblance of " normal. " <p> One of their questions really had me thinking... " Are you employed? " I had to say no, I just stay at home. As I answered the question, I suddenly felt ashamed. I felt like I was being judged as lazy and worthless because I stay home. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that way, but I assumed and convinced myself this is what they must think. Here they are working and helping people, while I stay at home and watch Mickey 's Clubhouse and talk to babies all day. It has gotten to the point that I find myself minimizing my role, that I 'm just a stay-at-home mom. <p> I ca n't join every activity there is at the church, and I ca n't commit to helping a family move or deliver meals. I do what I can. I try to make cards when I have free time and send them out to people for encouragement. I bake cookies once a month for the church, I work in the church nursery and I sing on our praise team once a month. <p> While doing the same routine of cleaning, cooking and taking care of children I find myself, more often than not, feeling as if I have no worth. These negative thoughts flood my thinking often, when I see all these other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bible study I was sharing and I started off by saying, " I am just a stay-at-home mom. " The older, wiser women( who had once been where I am in life) came back with something that stopped me in my tracks. They listed off the reasons why staying at home was my way of serving God. <p> I realized that I really was serving the King. I 'm not out taking care of others, but I am keeping my home in order, taking care of my husband, and my four children who are being brought up learning about Christ. I am exactly where God wants me. He planted me here and I have one of the most important jobs in the world. <p> Proverbs 31 reminds me of this... <p> 10 A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. 11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. 12 She brings him good, not harm, all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flax and works with eager hands. 14 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. 15 She gets up while it is still night ; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants. 16 She considers a field and buys it ; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. 17 She sets about her work vigorously ; her arms are strong for her tasks. 18 She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. 19 In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. 20 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. 21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household ; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. 22 She makes coverings for her bed ; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. 23 Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies the merchants with sashes. 25 She is clothed with strength and dignity ; she can laugh at the days to come. 26 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. 27 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 28 Her children arise and call her blessed ; her husband also, and he praises her : 29 " Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all. " 30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting ; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 31 Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate. Proverbs 31:10-31 <p> I know that I am not going to be a stay at home mom forever. My children will grow up and God will call me somewhere else. It may be the classroom, or something I 've never dreamed of. <p> All I know is wherever I end up, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and I will continue to serve Him there. <p> From elementary teacher to stay at home mom, Julie Wilson has her hands full in Valparaiso, Indiana.

Khaleef and I have had many conversations about this, and I have shed many tears, feeling inadequate because I am home instead of working a 9-5. I am still learning that God knows what He is doing, and I have seen the way my character is being molded through my ' now ' situation. It has been great seeing how all things work together for the good... **25;7667;TOOLONG recently posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie, another wonderful article. Very inspiring. This coming from a formet stay at home mom too.. it is the most important job and my girls being 15 and almost 18.. i am so thankful God allowed me to stay at home. It wasnt eady but i wouldnt have haf sny ithet way <p> My comment got cut off.. The end of my comment to you julie is that it wasnt easy but i wouldnt have it any other way! I remember going to church and spending most of the time in nursery with fussy kids, but we were there. and then as the girls grew up they new that church was so important! As mothers it seems we have to be everything to everybody with little time for ourselves. savour these moments jules, our babies grow up so fast. Thank you so much for being so great and I am SO very blessed to have you in my life.. Much love to you my sweet best friend!! TINA <p> I loved this. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should n't I be at home, full-time with my kids raising them to be good, spiritual people? And some day, I may do just that. But, for now, I help others conquer their greatest fear( because Public Speaking is the number one fear over death and a tax audit!), teach them to think a different thought. My children have a living example of a happy, full-filled woman. They will learn from my example that they have choices, and it 's about what works best for your family at the time. <p> I think you are doing a great job. And do n't ever let yourself believe for one more moment that it is not a job. I know it sounds like a cliche, but it truly is the most important job there is. And you do it so well. <p> This article is beautiful and my sister was a stay at home for a couple years and she still to this day says it was the hardest job she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and all the running around like a mad women, but because she knew that Zach and Kayla were watching her every move and that everything she did they would take in and she just wanted to be the best she could be. <p> I think you are a special path from God and we never know what is in the plans for us, so we take it day by day if not at times second by second. <p> Thank you for being the WONDERFUL " everything " that you are too so many of us! Love you tons Robby Reno <p> Great article, thanks for sharing. I will gladly embrace the honor of being a stay at home mom when kids come in the picture. I 'll need this reminder when I have days where I believe the lie that I 'm not contributing because I do n't bring home a paycheck. God is good. Jessica @ Budget For Health recently posted.. Should we move to Canada? <p> I agree with you. I have mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at home Dad. There is a whole different kind of shame reserved for a husband/father who does n't want to earn the bacon. <p> At very least do your husband a favor and tell him often how much you appreciate the opportunity to stay at home with the kids. Regardless of the fact that it is a VERY tough job and the best thing for the kids. He is still sacrificing to make that possible. <p> Thank you for your comment! I am constantly telling my husband how grateful I am! I feel so blessed and grateful. I spoil him when he is home because he sacrifices so much! Thanks for the reminder! Jules <p> Great Article Julie. I am not a Mom and can not relate to this, but I know your job is a difficult one. I have seen both my sister and sister in law both go through being stay at home Mom 's and I know the work that goes into it. I think you are doing a wonderful job raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that they will all turn out just as wonderful as Angie &lt;3 <p> Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.
