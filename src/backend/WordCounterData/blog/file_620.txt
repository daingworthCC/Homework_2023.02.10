5170441 <p> If only I knew that! I would have put it right here on my own blog instead of letting someone else claim it. Which they did, of course ; a popular Serbian blogger, Jelica Greganovic, even claimed that she wrote it last year, though I have the book right here in my hand, copyright 1992.( sigh). <p> So if you 'd like to read the funniest blog post ever about parenting, here it is. I wrote it back when I was my real name, which seems like such a long time ago now... before I became Colin Falconer... and before I became Jelica Greganovic apparently. <p> THE FUNNIEST BLOG POST EVER ABOUT PARENTING. <p> Preparing or the Happy Event <p> Work out now! <p> Some couples prepare for having children by going to baby shops and building extensions on their houses. This is the wrong approach. Parenthood is not just a matter of decorating a nursery and making more space. Raising offspring, like abseiling and martial arts, can not be learned from a book. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is by practice. But once you have a child, it 's too late. You 'll be too tired, physically, emotionally and spiritually to learn anything new for at least five years. <p> You need to start working out NOW! <p> Here 's a training circuit you should incorporate into your life right now, 24 simple exercises that will help prepare you for the experience of being a father... <p> 1. Go home. Pick up the newspaper. Read it for the last time. Move straight to exercise 2... <p> 2. To discover what the nights are like, walk round the living room from about 5 in the afternoon till ten at night carrying a wet bag weighing approximately eight to twelve pounds. At ten o'clock, put the bag down, set the alarm for midnight and go to sleep. <p> Get up at twelve and walk round the living room again -- with the bag, of course -- till one am. Set the alarm for three am. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two and make a cup of coffee. Go to bed at quarter to three. <p> Get up at three when the alarm goes off. Sing Wiggles songs in the dark till 4 am. Put the alarm on for five. Get up, make breakfast. <p> Keep this up for about five years. Look cheerful. <p>( Note : do n't worry, hallucinating is normal.) <p> the book where the funniest blog post ever came from. Who 'd have thought? <p> 3. As all small children have a vital neuron missing in their brains making it impossible for them to agree to anything, you must practice a technique known as ' negative gearing '. That is, you gear every question you ever utter so that agreement required a negative. Practise saying things like : ' It 's not that you do n't not want to not to go to bed, do n't you? ' <p> Master this technique or you wo n't not never make it through parenthood. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a bit of a shock. Children can be a little messy at times. To allay this trauma, try it out now and see if you can stand it. <p> First, smear peanut butter on the sofa and jelly on all the curtains. Hide a piece of chicken behind the music centre and leave it there through the summer. Finally, stick your finger in the flower bed, and wipe them clean on the walls. Cover over the stains with crayon. <p> There. Finished. How does that look to you? <p> 5. Before you finally decide to go ahead, find a couple who already have children and berate them about their methods of discipline, their lack of patience, their appallingly low tolerance levels and the way they have allowed their children to run riot. Suggest ways in which they might improve their child 's sleeping habits, toilet training and overall behavior. <p> Enjoy yourself. It will be the last time in your life you 'll have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children, is not as easy as it appears <p> photograph : LDorfman <p> form a distance.

Take an egg box and, using only a pair of scissors and a pot of green paint, turn it into an alligator. Now take a toilet roll tube and, using some glue and some Alcan foil, make a Christmas cracker. Finally, take a milk container, a ping pong ball and an empty packet of Rice Krispies and make an exact replica of the Angkor Wat. <p> Congratulations : you have qualified for Play Group Committee. <p> 9. Family cars are vital accessories for children. Sell your Mustang Corvette and buy a People Mover. Wait! Do n't just leave it out in the driveway spotless and shining. Family cars do n't look like that. <p> Buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box. Leave it there. Get a <p> photograph : Spinoziano <p> nickel and stick it in the DVD player. Snap off the console lid and the windscreen wiper controls. Wrench off the side view mirrors. Mash a packet of chocolate biscuits down the back seats.

Walk out the door. Come back in again. Go out. Come back in. Go out. Come back in again. <p> Go down the front path. Come back. Go back down the path. Walk very slowly along the street for five minutes, stopping to inspect every cigarette end, every piece of used chewing gum and dead insect on the footpath. Retrace your steps. Go back up your front path. <p> Now scream that you 've had about as much as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. Give up and go back into the house. Do it all again a few minutes later. <p> Well done. You are now ready to take a small child for a wlak to the shops. <p> ' Now pretend I 'm an aeroplane... ' photograph : Craig O'Neal <p> 11. Always repeat everything you say five times.

Take with you the nearest thing you can <p> ' When you grow up, you 'll realize that life is not so black and white. ' photograph : Brocken-inaglory <p> find to a pre-school child -- a fully grown goat is excellent. If you intend to have more than one child, take more than one goat. Now take the child( goat) to the local mall. Do not let the child( goat) out of your sight. Pay for everything your child( goat) eats or destroys.

Time limit : two years. <p> 17. To imagine how your wife will look, have her put on a pair of your work socks. Buy her a terry-towelling housecoat. Stick a bean bag down the front and leave it there for nine months. After nine months take out ten per cent of the beans. <p> I survived parenthood, and apparently so did they copyright : Colin Falconer <p> 18. Go to your local drugstore and tip the contents of your wallet on the counter and tell the pharmacist to help himself. Then go to the doctor. Sign a blank check and hand it to him. Now go to the supermarket and arrange to have your wages paid directly to their head office in Seattle. <p> 19. Hollow out a pumpkin, Make a hole in the side roughly the size of a golf ball. Attach the pumpkin to a piece of rope and suspend it from the ceiling. Swing the pumpkin so that it sways from side to side in a two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attempt to spoon it into the swaying pumpkin by pretending to be a jet plane. One hit out of ten is considered a pass. Two out of ten is excellent. <p> Continue until half the cereal is gone. Tip the rest in your lap. You are now ready to feed a 12 month old child. <p> 20. Toddlerhood is a very sensitive time. During this time some children <p> according to the copyright section at the front, I wrote this. <p> become very insecure and tend to cling to their parents.

Take the elevator to the second floor and <p> start browsing in the book department or reminiscing among the golf and football equipment. At the count of ten. Hurry! Quick! Find a bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds. <p> I do n't think Jelica was the only one to steal your work, Colin. I read something very similar to this last year. I remember laughing like an idiot because it was so funny. Wish I could remember where I saw it, but I do n't have a clue( it 's been a LONG year or so). If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I wonder what out-and-out theft would be? Oh... that 's right. Plagiarism. <p> Thanks Kristy. You know, I do n't mind people running pieces of mine, in fact I encourage it, all I wanted was a credit and link. I got neither from anyone and in the end got not a single sale from it. And people saying : well it was on the internet and we did n't know who it belonged to ' just does n't wash anymore. If it 's not attributed it means someone stole it, and they did n't cred it it. Things just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply on the internet. <p> One thing about the internet, Colin, is that there are a lot of people who need to have their access to it revoked. In fact, I 'd like to see a good lot of them confined to an island somewhere so that the only things they can steal are coconuts and raw fish from the other content thieves. They all know what they 're doing. <p> That 's freakin ' unbelievable. What a jerk for copying your stuff... But congrats on getting more proof you 're a genius. I guess that 's how I 'd try to look at it, after I screamed and beat the shit out of my punching bag for a while. <p> It 's horrible to discover this sort of thing. My blog revenue barely covers the cost of the hosting, yet I 've had my written content stolen more than once by idiots out for a quick buck. I 'm so grateful that Google exists as I can now do content searches and image searches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
