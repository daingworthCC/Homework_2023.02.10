5114541 <p> Hi Everyone, some of you might remember me, my D has been in recovery for two years. She is now off travelling and has been known to drop in on the likes of Charlotte, who we are forever grateful to for being her soft landing in the UK. <p> I have a friend whose son is quite young, he has autism and has recently been diagnosed with AN. <p> Red, she might fancy a visit. I am in a bit of a cleft stick. She is only around for another 5 weeks before she heads to North America( yes, Colleen, you are on her list!) but she is travelling round with her friend from Australia at the moment. I LOVE having her around. She makes us all laugh. She is so funny. And interesting. And clever. And all round cool beans. H and I are really going to miss our adopted daughter but perhaps I could share her with you.... <p> This forum is sponsored by F.E.A.S.T., an organization of parents serving parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and other eating disorders.
