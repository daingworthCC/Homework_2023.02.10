5151141 <p> Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor are the most dominant beach volleyball pairing in Olympic history, but it turns out they were more than just a pair at the London Olympics. The three-time gold medalists were a threesome. On Monday morning, Walsh Jennings revealed that she was carrying a baby during the memorable run. <p> " When I was throwing my body around fearlessly, and going for gold for our country, I was pregnant, and today I 'm 11 weeks pregnant, " Walsh Jennings said on " The TODAY Show. " <p> Kerri and her husband, Casey Jennings, are expecting the newest addition to their family on April 9. They also have a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old son.

" I thought it could have been the stress of the games and travel kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point, you 're late and then you start feeling something.

And as for Rio 2016, Walsh Jennings said she fully intends to get back into shape and that the tiny Oakley bikini she has to wear serves as plenty of motivation -- and we know how they respect those bikinis. <p> About Steve DelVecchio : Steve DelVecchio is an editor and lead contributor for Larry Brown Sports.
