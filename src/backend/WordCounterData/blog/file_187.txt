5126841 <p> During his time at Wesleyan University, Ted was determined to impress his cocky and aloof architecture teacher. Sadly, his attempts failed to win Professor Vinick 's approval -- and things have n't changed much in the present. <p> I miss the oc..... it was the only teen drama i ever watched. but also as much as i would have liked the show to have continued the last episode was awesomely perfect......
