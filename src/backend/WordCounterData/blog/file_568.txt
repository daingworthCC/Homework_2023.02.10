5165241 <p> Daily Beast writer Andrew Sullivan appeared on " This Week, " saying that if Mitt Romney wins back Florida and Virginia in the Nov. 6th presidential elections, it will be due to the white vote and the South 's electoral map will look exactly as it did during the pro-slavery Confederacy during the Civil War. Sullivan made this observation when host George Stephanopoulos said the latest polls show six out of 10 white Americans intended to vote for Mitt Romney. <p> PBS reporter Gwen Ifill, who also appeared on the show, said that " we ca n't ignore " that there is the possibility that racial animus may play a role in this election. She cited a recent Associated Press poll that found people are still willing to admit " racial bias. " <p> To that, Andrew Sullivan added : " If Virginia and Florida go back to the Republicans, it 's the Confederacy. Entirely. You put a map of the Civil War over this electoral map, you 've got the Civil War. " Yeah, when we used horses and bayonets. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stupid thing to say. Those are the types of generalizations that turn off swing low info moron voters. Also, racism did not make Obama forget to show up at the first debate. florida is Romney 's... Done deal. Virginia is completely in the air. <p> After almost 4 years of innuendo and obvious dog whistles by the GOP, I 'm not surprised at the racial animus. In tough economic times, the constant messsage that Barak Obama is not one of " us ", does not understand the american experience, and most blatent of all, hates whites and is a radical muslum, giver certain portions of the population someone to blame, the black guy in the white house. <p> The last I heard was Obama might lose 2 percentage points because of race. I was surprised( and pleased) it was n't higher. As my elderly( WV) relative said in 2008 " I ca n't vote for a white woman or a black man " -- I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another friend, a very successful business man, that was always sending me those bigoted emails barely disguised as concern about the economy, socialism etc. I asked him if he also sent those to our mutual high school buddy who is black. At first he was highly incensed, but I notice those types of emails have quit coming and now it 's just about the debt crisis. Sometimes it pays to hit them where it counts. <p> What a ludicrous premise. Virginia is very conservative, except for outside of DC and the impoverished areas around Norfolk. That it 's been Blue at all is a fluke. <p> As far as Florida goes, they 've been EXTREMELY hard-hit by the housing crisis and although it was n't Obama 's fault only now -- 4 years later -- is the market coming back. It can easily be argued that he did n't do enough. <p> People may vote by race, but they 're MORE likely to vote by pocketbook, and it 's no shock that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down to Ft. Belvoir, VA., and when we stopped at a diner for lunch the black soldiers had to eat in the kitchen or separately, I ca n't remember which. I do n't believe old memories and attitudes die so quickly, although I wish they did. <p> People may vote by race, but they 're MORE likely to vote by pocketbook <p> Barky is right. The electorate was willing to take an enlightened view in 08 because they were frightened( with good reason) in the wake of Bush/Cheney. What 's skin color compared to money fears? Now that magic ponies have n't been forthcoming within 4 years racism is becoming more of a factor. <p> I remember going down to Ft. Belvoir, VA., and when we stopped at a diner for lunch the black soldiers had to eat in the kitchen or separately, I ca n't remember which. I do n't believe old memories and attitudes die so quickly, although I wish they did. <p> I agree dduck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ft. Rucker, AL to Ft. Campbell, KY in 196 mumble my wife and I stopped at a gas station. While getting gas I went to use the bathroom but was confused because there were three doors, " 1?... " 2?... and " 3. " <p> I asked the attendant what it meant and it turned out there were 3 bathrooms... " 1? for white men, " 2? for white women, and " 3? for blacks. <p> That ' life lesson ' gave me a permanent and full-time disdain for ALL racists and bigots. It 's a lesson that, as sorry as it was to see, makes me a better person than I was, and forever thankful that I learned it. <p> Now, for the first time in a long time, I 'm seeing it starting all over again. Not in three bathrooms but in an attitude from the right that seems to be saying, " The ' Blacks ' have their place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad... Very sad. <p> Racism has not gotten worse, it has only bubbled back into the public sphere. Most racists simply kept their feelings to themselves. Apparently the reelection of a black President and hyper partisanship has made people a little crazy. <p> I sometimes agree with AS, and is n't it possible that there could be an increase in animus towards Obama because he is 1/2 Black? <p> I 'm sure it happens. So? My brother voted for Obama because he was black and he did n't figure it mattered very much who was president. He wanted a post racial America. I keep hearing how all these voters are voting against " the Black guy " but what about the ones that are just voting for his race? <p> Is n't it white liberals/democrats who are n't voting for Obama that we are discussing here? The ones who ordinarily would have voted for the democratic candidate but are n't? He would n't have been in the running for republican votes anyway. The
