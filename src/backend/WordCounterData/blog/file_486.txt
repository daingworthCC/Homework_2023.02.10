5157041 <p> I thought they looked like rainbow sherberts. LMFAO! But I think I shall try to win one in a raffle or they also have 4 up on ebay right now for auction. IMO... the starting price is a bit too high though.( $500 smackers) <p> It was a win but it was sloppy and undisciplined... again. Now I got ta go out and drink some Belgian beer just to wash away the stank of all those penalites. PK was en fuego again though---which is a team skill they thankfully excel at considering their dunderheadedness. <p> 17 Nov <p> the canadian dream <p> racist!! <p> 17 Nov <p> bookjones <p> If loathing those retina-burning " Los IceHogs " sweaters means I am a racist then so be it you piece of Canadian trash! Now leave me alone hoser. <h> Roberto Luongo : Chicago 's definitely one of them <p> Roberto Luongo was on 99.3 The Fox 's " The Jeff O'Neill Show " and endured a 22 minute in-depth interview, most of which is about his future in the NHL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Luongo told CFOX-FM 99.3. " I 've always said I like playing in Chicago. " <p> A Red Wings fan called into the show trying to convince Luongo that his best shot at winning a Cup is in Chicago and wondered if he would ever play here. <p> " That 's a good question, " Luongo said. " I think there 's a lot of cities that are great to play in, and Chicago 's definitely one of them. But you have to realize that it works both ways. There 's not only me involved in this decision. It 's also a question if the Blackhawks would be interested, if the team would be interested in trading me there, and if I would be willing to go there. " <p> Later in the show the host asked Luongo about Chelsea Dagger, his reponse : " I like that song -- it 's catchy, " Luongo said. " I heard it seven times in one game. " <p> In the interview Luongo did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kings ended his season, coupled with the fact that it 's quite obvious that the list of teams interested in his services is a very short list. Whether the Blackhawks are actually interested in him really holds no water yet, and this could just be a case of his camp " pumping tires " to reach out to teams and hoping someone takes another look. In other words, take it with a grain of salt. <p> At the same time, there 's a lot of smoke behind this rumor at the moment and it would n't surprise me to see Stan Bowman look elsewhere after failing to woo Marty Brodeur away from the New Jersey Devils. If Stan is going to make this move, he will either find himself in the unemployment line at this time next year, or nominated for GM of the Year. It 's a risk, but this would n't be the first time a GM tried to save their job after receiving a lot of pressure from the top of the front office. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big risks and Luongo is probably the biggest he can take. The contract coupled with the fact that he is portrayed as the villain in Chicago certainly works against him from both a marketing standpoint and a business standpoint. Then again, the Blackhawks did take a similar risk on Carcillo, granted that was n't as much of a financial risk, but Chicago fans did n't really have a huge issue with that. It seems like a long-shot, but certainly not impossible. <p> I am slowly warming up to the player in chicago but the contract scares me. <p> Yea I think that 's the biggest issue, although the Cap hit is only 5.2 mil. That said if Rocky was willing to eat the last three years I 'd do it in a heart beat. Definitely a HUGE upgrade in goal. how much of Lou 's choke was LOU, verses the team imploding in front of him. Think about it. Everytime they fell apart the TEAM was playing dumb and hanging him out to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before last. Thomas happened to be better and his TEAM did not score goals for him. I do n't remember him ever choking a game away like Crawford did twice in the playoffs last year in OT. <p> If you get Lou, I think you still have to keep Crawford. If Rocky is comfortable with $6,714,000 for 6 more years before his salary drops to $3,382,000 and then nearly $1M for the remaining 3 seasons. <p> Here 's something to consider : After Luongo is traded, his NTC will no longer apply therefore can be traded anywhere, which really increases his value down the line for a potential team paying a lower salary( last 4 years) to reach the cap floor. <p> Here 's the bad news : He 's 33. By the time his salary drops, he 'll be around 40 years old. How many more years can he really last and will Rocky want to pay him $6.7M past 35 years old? <p> It 's a high risk, high reward scenario. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it may not be up to him with Rocky dishing out the dough. It would just make more sense to go after Bernier or someone else that carries a lower risk and possibly good reward. <p> I 'm in the No camp for reasons that are n't secret. I do n't like him. Probably a lot of that has to do with the product of his environment like RK said but still... there is something about him I just do n't like. <p> Better than Craw? Yes.. but 3 million dollars per year for 7 more years better? Not sure. Obviously that 10 mill salary is done and it goes back to a somewhat respectable 6.7 for the next 7 years. " somewhat respectable ".. it 's still too much and too long. I think if we were looking at the right now.. then yah it 's a gamble that might be worth it. If we are throwing the future in there also I think the Hawks can find a better option and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just me. I get both sides of the argument. <p> I 'm not completely sold in Crawford as a number one but I am also not completely unsold. Consistency is his problem.. ca n't find that without playing more. Lou has consistency issues also... it 's not like he is n't imune. And he too collapses at the wrong time and he has experience over Crawford. Product of the environment or not a mentally strong goalie? Probably a little of both. <p> And again I am not sure if everyone in the dressing room likes the guy and vice versa. Yes they are pros and I am sure they can gell and let the air simmer. <p> There is no doubt he does n't like me! Although he may like the banter. Obrien did n't like me yet paid me my 100 bucks. Like I said Lou is a riot for taking the shit I hand his way and always still being nice to me. <p> I hate all of you for even thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JERKS! <p> However, to those of you who are still haters, I salute you. <p> All I give a shit about is my team. If I think a player is going to help verses the player here, I do n't fucking care about previous shit. I 'd take Kesler if he were availabe. Holy fuck would that solve our Center position. That said as long as he 's a Canuck, fuck him. Take that Suck fuck jersey off, I 'll consider anything! <p> All I give a shit about is my team.

Want to keep it classy. <p> Luongo has been one of the few goalies where he been able to play in spite of his team. Both in Van and Florida. I mean, look at the defensemen the Canucks have had. Very, very rare to have a goalie like that, it 's an absolute joke he has n't won at least one Vezina. More of my concern would be what 's going back rather than the contract. 5.2 cap hit, yeah it 's maybe a bit more than I would like to pay a goalie in today 's NHL but he would be an exception, one of the few. And I do n't expect, that if he were to be traded, that he would be playing here throughout the remainder of his contract anyway. 9 years left and he
