5163941 <h> Honeywell Promises to Improve the Quality of XTRATUF Boots <p> Alaska Senator Mark Begich confronted the Honeywell Corporation in October of 2012 about the quality of XTRATUF boots now being manufactured by the company in China. The rubber boots hold a near cult following in the Great Land and seeing their production move outside of the United States has upset many Alaskans. <p> Honeywell Vice President Richard Graber responded to Senator Begich 's concerns about their product quality and offered some insights on how the company planned to improve customer satisfaction in a letter dated October 16, 2012.
