5173841 <h> Post navigation <h> The MUSE is on the loose- II <p> Earlier in this blog, I wrote of M.U.S.E. or Metaphysical Universal Story Enlightenment. Recently the spooky apparition appeared again, while I was doing final research in preparation for the publishing of my third book, The God Particle. I was( leisurely) looking through a jaunty romp of a dissertation on sonar dynamics as it relates to thermo layers and cavitation anomalies of audio wave propagation in salt water. Well as you know, when you are that deep into a subject you stumble on other things. <p> In my research of( here 's another ' could n't put it down read '!) Deep Water Submarine Tactics of the Cold War 1962-1970, I stumbled across a mild reference to the undersea tapping of Soviet military phone lines( see the original M.U.S.E. blog for the amazing story of how I conjured up the name U.S.S.

I liked Klaven, so bang, my super spook retired, was now Russ Klaven( friends call him Clay) but that was months ago, last week in military history files I found this... Later, in a brainstorm, Commander John Craven dreamed up the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Okhotsk... The sub, Halibut, was refitted for the mission and a " tap " was designed for the effort. <p> Okay, Craven -- Klaven. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.
