5135641 <h> Hello Andre, we are honoured to have you on Trance Hub. You were of course one of the first artists we treasured when we just started listening to this genre. Let 's start with an easy question... People normally have a dog or a cat as a pet, you have a rabbit. What is it called and why a rabbit? <p> We have two rabbits, one is called ATbunny, the other on is called Maggie. Bunny is a little bit more active than Maggie. She 's more like a little diva, but both love to sit on the couch and watch TV with us. As you can imagine my wife and I are a lot on the road, so it would be very difficult for us to keep a cat or a dog. But our parents can easily look after ATbunny and Maggie when we are travelling. We really love the two and they are a part of our family. <h> We have all grown up to your music and we call you the first superstar of Trance music. How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICQ messenger IDs and even names of their kids dedicated to ATB? <p> This is of course something really special for me and I 'm really proud of it. But one of the craziest things I 've ever seen were tattooed people with the ATB logo. This is unbelievable. I mean you have to wear this tattoo your entire life. So the people dedicated a part of their body to my artist name and the music I make. This is awesome. <p> Full ; o). Whereby especially when I produce a new album I take up to three, four months off just to produce the album. No gigs, no other meetings or projects. During this time I fully concentrate on music and I am in the studio nearly every day. <p> Of course the preparation for this studio time already starts many weeks before when I sift through all the ideas I collected during my tours, check if I can use them for the album, search for new unique singers or create some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love this production time to create something new, to surprise the people and to look forward to their reaction. On the other hand it 's of course really stressful. You have to be creative and get a lot of pressure to produce a good album during this time. <h> A clich question, but we really want to know the story behind " 9 PM( Till I Come) " -- the inspiration, the vocals, etc. etc. <p> It was more by sheer fluke that I had a visitor and wanting to show her my studio just before we intended to go to the cinema. On one of my synthesizers was a factory sound called " Guitar ". For demonstration purposes of the studio I started recording and played this melody. It was really cool and I continued to work on it. Finally we had to leave for the cinema and I had to save the track. It was 9 PM, so I saved the project with this name. <p> The next day I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finished the track. Looking at the sample I promptly got into trouble because I was n't legally clarified to use it. So finally I had to pay for the using rights of this sample : o) <h> A fellow DJ and fan from Germany( @NOiZEE) asks, why do n't you have a radio show? <p> For me it 's very important to always be in direct contact with the people in front of stage when I 'm performing. This direct contact, communication, mood and atmosphere is really essential for me and makes a set for me emotional and unique. A radio show could never convey these emotions, which I want to share with my listeners and which are the most important thing for me whenever I present music. <h> They say it 's difficult to make sequels. What were the challenges to make a sequel for ' Sunset Beach DJ Session ' after a year 's gap and an album in the middle? <p> After releasing the first ' Sunset Beach DJ Session ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally, it 's of course not easy to make a sequel and as you said it was also a great challenge. Especially to convey this unique feeling of the sun, sea and beach, which was already created by listening to the first ' Sunset Beach DJ Session ' was not easy. So it took a lot of time to find the right tracks and mixture to continue this unique feeling. In the end I 'm very happy about the result and at once I received a lot of positive feedback from my listeners. This is the biggest honour I could ever have received. <h> With almost 200 tracks coming out every week, how do you keep up with new music ; is there an ATB trick procedure you may want to share? <p> No, there is no trick. I get a lot of promos I listen to and of course it takes a lot of time to listen to all of them. So when I start listening to a snippet of a track it has to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trash. If I like the first 10 seconds I listen to the whole track and decide if it 's something for my DJ case. <h> You always feature some classics in your compilations ; there are some great ones in ' Sunset Beach DJ Session 2?. What is the thought behind the same, ever thought of creating an ATB classic compilation? <p> Well, on my ' ATB THE DJ 5? compilation I already dedicated a CD only to classic tracks, but this was something really special. In general it does not matter to me if a track is old or new, as long as it 's good. Perhaps I will produce another classic CD sometime in future, but there is nothing planned as yet up to now. My next project will be a new ATB album. <h> After an extensive career spanning over 15 years and seeing EDM evolve over time. What is something that still delights you about it? <p> Every gig is something delightful for me cause every crowd is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the possibility to travel a lot and meet so many people all over the world. This is a gift for me and I really enjoy every second of these moments. <h> You extensively tour USA, Europe but what will it take to bring ATB to India? <p> We already tried to organize some gigs in India, but unfortunately there were always problems as soon as we went into details. Last time for example, the promoter disappeared without a trace from one day to the other. This was really strange. Especially because it was a really big company with lots of good references. But I 'm sure we will find a new, good and reliable partner very soon to check the possibilities of gigs in India. <h> 3 replies to this article <p> Emi says : <p> 26th September, 2012 at 1:34 PM <p> Piece of great job TranceHub!
