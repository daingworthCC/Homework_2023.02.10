5194841 <h> Spotify is not profitable and no matter that it is not, for now <p> Spotify is receiving much attention these past few weeks, and it seems that the company is preparing a new round of funding that would value the company at $ 3 or $ 4 billion dollars. But why do you need more money Spotify? According to CrunchBase, which is usually very reliable in these cases, Spotify has achieved so far $ 188 million venture capital fund. The first round of funding took place in 2008, $ 21. 6,000,000 and last a little over a year, in June 2011, of $ 100 million. According to sources consulted by the Wall Street Journal the company would now be in the process of raising another $ 100 million, which would be used to establish the business and, above all, to get more users in the countries in which it operates. In short, to grow. A Spotify right now is not worried not be a profitable venture. In fact far from it. According to leaked a few weeks ago Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 244 million. Eric Eldon, editor of TechCrunch, noted recently that in the first 6 months of 2012 Spotify has already achieved $ 200 million in revenue and could reach $ 500, with an estimated loss of $ 40 million for the full year.

Knowing that nearly every dollar that Spotify generates are paid to record companies( $ 200 million per year or 75% of total paid) and taking into account the above, we have a scenario in which a Spotify only worth two things : increase the ratio of paid users or keep that ratio but on a very user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be achieved in the overnight and requires a lot of time and money. In Spotify know. Investors also know.
