5188541 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie : That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. " -- II Thessalonians, 2:11-12( KJV) <p> The latest bizarre turn in the strange saga of Barrett Brown came to my attention Wednesday evening while I was on the phone with a friend talking about the( equally bizarre) attacks against me by Larry Sinclair, notorious for his claim of having once been Barack Obama 's gay lover. <p> Damn, I get some of the weirdest enemies, do n't I? <p> So I was on the phone talking about this and related stuff, and I 'm not quite sure how the name Barrett Brown came up, but my friend said, " Have you seen his latest videos? " <p> When I said I had not, my friend said, " Oh, man, you 've got to go check it out. It 's funny as hell. He 's talking all kinds of crazy stuff about the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, this is simply a fact : A lot of the Anonymous people never trusted Barrett Brown, regarding him as an untrustworthy egomaniacal fame-seeker trying to cash in. He did a TV interview with Michael Isikoff of NBC and announced a book deal with Gregg Housh, and did all of this while promoting himself as the official spokesman for Anonymous, whose members are... well, anonymous, and with good reason, because the cops would very much like to put a lot of them in prison. <p> Hackers are generally smart enough to add 2 + 2, and if Brown 's get-out-of-jail-free card was contingent on him becoming an FBI informant, he had a serious problem, because none of his hacker buddies trusted him as far as they could throw him. <p> You do n't need a lawyer, Barrett. You need a psychiatrist, or perhaps a priest to exorcise your demons. You are traveling a road to destruction, as harmful to yourself as to any of your chosen enemies. Get help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And so Wednesday when my friend told me about Barrett 's latest " hilarious " video, I was curious -- and shocked by what I saw when I clicked on his YouTube channel. Are you sure you can handle the intense craziness? Because this is 13 minutes of absolute 100% bugfucking nuts : <p> Somebody should transcribe that before it 's deleted. You may not get all the references -- HB Gary is the security firm that got hacked by LulzSec, Aaron Barr is the executive whose e-mails were stolen in the hacking, and Jennifer Emick is the former Anonymous member who identified LulzSec leader Sabu. A lot of this " Team Themis " stuff that Barrett Brown was ranting about shows up, by the way, in Neal Rauhauser 's conspiracy-theory document " Andrew Breitbart 's ISR Cell? " <p> Being a paranoid conspiracy theorist is not illegal, and Brown 's tinfoil-hat rantings about HB Gary and Jen Emick were just so much noise. But his threats to " destroy " FBI agent Robert Smith? Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly : <p> Dallas law enforcement authorities have arrested self-professed Anonymous spokesman Barrett Brown in what appears to have been a dramatic raid of his apartment late Wednesday night. Barrett was having a live online video chat session with a few others when law enforcement officers can be heard storming into the room and shouting at him to comply with their commands to submit to his arrest.... A spokeswoman for the Dallas County Sheriff 's office confirmed the arrest and said Brown was booked into the county jail at around 11 p.m. CT and has since been transferred to an FBI facility. A spokeswoman from the FBI field office in Dallas said the agency had no comment on the arrest.... No official reason has been offered yet as to why Barrett was arrested. But it may be connected to a YouTube video Barrett released yesterday in which he appears to threaten an FBI agent named Robert Smith. In the rambling 13-minute expletive-laced video, Barrett accuses Smith of getting his mother into trouble on obstruction of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from authorities.... <p> You can read the whole thing, which actually has video of the raid, which went down while Barrett was having an online video chat with his fellow crazies. Hilarious? Not at all. <p> Brown is mentally ill, but he 's also young and handsome and intelligent, which permitted him to attract a sort of fan club of enablers who encouraged his anti-social deviance and -- hey! -- it 's all just fun and games until somebody goes to federal prison. <p> What did Barrett Brown think he was doing? How has he come to this sorry end? He was playing at being an " investigative journalist, " hoping to achieve fame and fortune by exposing those corrupt evildoers using his amazing Internet skilz. <p> The White Knight rides forth in shining armor on his noble steed to slay the dangerous dragon! <p> It 's a common enough amateur fantasy nowadays, and these cyber-Walter Mitty types magnify their dragons -- " Islamophobic extremist " Aaron Walker, " convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain -- in order to inflate their own glory as the triumphant White Knight. The Narcissist as Self-Imagined Hero -- they 're a dime a dozen nowadays. When his long-awaited expos of the evildoers falls flat, when the long-promised triumph does n't result in fame and fortune, the narcissist ca n't comprehend his own failure. <p> " Who the hell is Jen Emick? " <p> You see? There is a tiny fringe of kooks who are obsessed with Jen Emick, Aaron Barr, HB Gary, yadda yadda, and a guy like Barrett Brown plays to that kook fringe, imagining that their fixation with these things represents a potential worldwide interest. <p> If only Barrett can prove what the fringe kooks believe -- that the villains they hate are part of a vast Watergate-sized scandal -- then he can imagine the unspeakable glory that awaits. <p> " Yesterday began releasing revelations from stolen e-mails and other research on Holder/HBGary/Endgame Systems conspiracy against myself and potentially other activists associated with the transparency movement, " he wrote to TheDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaks... got me banned from Daily Kos last week after 8 years of writing there, " Brown told TheDC. <p> This is not merely bovine excrement, it 's delusional. Once you understand paranoia as a narcissistic disorder, you see that Barrett 's fantasy of becoming a latter-day Sy Hersh involves a vast chasm between his grandiose ambition and his actual abilities. <p> Barrett Brown is not as smart as he thinks he is. More to the point, Stephen Hawking is not as smart as Barrett Brown thinks he is. <p> Delusions of grandeur are symptomatic of a damaged ego, but we 'll leave aside the armchair analysis and deal with the reality : Barrett Brown went chasing a dream of eternal glory, and had contempt for lesser mortals who were merely trying to make a living as reporters or bloggers, and he actually had a better-than-average run, as such things go. He got himself interviewed by NBC News, was quoted by multiple publications as the spokesman for Anonymous, and even scored a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until somebody goes to federal prison. <p> Probably there 's a Moral of the Story, but I 'm too tired and depressed to figure it out today. All this swirling craziness -- thank you, savage Islamic movie critics! -- has pretty much ruined my entire week. Remember, I 'm supposed to be covering a presidential campaign, instead of writing 1,500-word dissertations about Internet fame junkies. <h> Comments <p> jwallin <p> this is what happens when a. you commit felonies and get away with them because you 're protected by a veil of the first amendment( well so far) that prevents the law from summarily assuming you 're guilty by association and taking you in.( just because) <p> b. you get high and then get angry and then decide to go on the intertubz. <p> c. are young, dumb and full of come and think you 'll live forever and bullets bounce off your chest.( You 're wrong) <p> d. you direct your juvenile tirade at someone who actually DOES pack some muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it.( and has lots and lots of friends) <p> have a nice time in jail, punk. <p> http : //2012. ak4mc.us/ McGehee <p> Have fun, Barrett. Remember : be nice to Bubba and Bubba will be nice to you. <p> He gets high -- and if he was n't( despite his claims) as high as a kite in that video, then his blown pupils were the result of a darkened room or something -- and says stupid things, and gets arrested. None of this is a surprise. The kid 's supposed to be smart, but he does this any way? Why? <p> http : //boogieforward.us/ K-Bob <p> But after then, there will be lights and stuff, right? <p> http : //twitter.com/LulzMouse Mouse <p> http : //pastebin.com/PRdYctxB Topiary is working for the government, and rang him the same day, likely to find out what he was going to release. Shows how much of a ' kook ' he is if they need to send a former member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Barrett Brown hid a laptop from the FBI by stashing at his mother 's house so he could claim the feds were terrorizing his mother when they went looking for it? Am I reading that right? It is difficult to tell through his angry rambling. <p> Brown is self-absorbed scum. He is one of those nutty narcissists who believes he is such a dangerous man because of his ideas that the powers that be are all out to get him, but then wets his pants when some authorities actually do come for him. <p> I will bet he sobbed like a lunatic once he was out of earshot of his chatting buddies during his arrest. <p> sablegsd <p> " handsome " <p> Oh hell no. <p> jefferson101 <p> Erm..... <p> Two problems here. First off, how is this any more Brownshirts at Midnight than the detention of whats-his-name-actually in California? <p> Second, it is noted that " No official reason has been offered yet as to why Barrett was arrested. " <p> Hotay. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My sympathy for the guy is nonexistent, but I have issues with the process being used, if it is as described. Is Stacy or Smitty next? Or am I? If they do n't need a reason...... <p> Yeah. You figure it out. I want to see the warrant and the charges, up front. Every farging time, please. <p> http : //2012. ak4mc.us/ McGehee <p> Maybe he really is, as Stacy suggested, an FBI informant -- and this is how they hustle him off to WITSEC. <p> yestradamous <p> I think he 's cute and i feel sorry for him that he was born with the personality that makes him an addict. I think the guy is brilliant in a lot of ways and also a huge waste of potential. <p> He knows it, too. And I think this crusade is, in his view, his chance at asking a real impact despite his self-imposed limitations. <p> http : //wizbangblog.com/ Adjoran <p> I think he was living at Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing her place apart may have agreed to turn over all his computing equipment, but had a laptop stashed there he did n't mention. If his Mom agreed to comply with the subpoena to avoid a search warrant, she could be charged with obstruction. <p> Seems he 's upset his little trick did n't work. <p> With his girlish looks, slight build, and big mouth, he 'll be a popular guy in prison, I suspect. <p> http : **31;10815;TOOLONG Evi L. Bloggerlady <p> Stacy : Back when you were a " ute, " it is possible you might have seeded some wild oats and created Barrett Brown? Excessive alcohol, mushrooms, some college party you were at... it could explain a lot. <p> http : //thecampofthesaints.org Bob Belvedere <p> Oh yes... and the song ' I 'll Stop The World And Melt With You ' will be played over and over. <p> http : //thecampofthesaints.org Bob Belvedere <p> Brown is mentally ill, but he 's also young and handsome and intelligent.... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only people he could attract are closeted Emos, fag-hags, and other queens. <p> http : //thecampofthesaints.org Bob Belvedere <p> Good point. The world is going through one 's periodic episodes of utter madness. <p> It 's the end of the world as we know it And I feel fine <p> http : //thecampofthesaints.org Bob Belvedere <p> Now that 's not nice, Evi! And it 's way off the mark, besides. <p> Everyone in the Inner Circle of the VRWC knows Stacy fathered Conor Friedersdorf! <p> http : **31;10848;TOOLONG Evi L. Bloggerlady <p> I am also guessing Matthew Yglesias may have been a spawn of those days of beers and mushrooms. <p> http : **31;10881;TOOLONG Evi L. Bloggerlady <p> All of it is disturbing to be sure. But it would explain how Brown keeps coming back to Stacy all the time. I am expecting a Star Wars reference any time now. <p> OK, I hung in there right up till the ' my dad used to kill elephants ' part. I kept expecting him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> http : **26;10914;TOOLONG LS News Group <p> Stacey, perhaps next time you call us asking us let bygones by bygones you might want to have the honesty to say you have written two articles in two days calling us " Crazy, " accusing us of " Attacking you " and of being an unsuspecting dupe of Kimberlins crew. So far all I see is you continuing to make everything about you or an attack on you and no effort on your part to acknowledge your continued acts which are identical to those you complain are being directed at you. Our response to your email of 11:59 AM today which you published on this site : <p> Stacey : While I appreciate your efforts to explain to me something you feel I have little understanding of. Let me however remind you that I am probably the last person anyone would need to explain these things too. See I understand very well what is taking place and I understand how these idiots operate. I have dealt with it far longer and in far worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that you and others feel these people are responsible for Ali being attacked, but nothing these individuals have done has anything to do with the fact that I and Sinclair News put our name onto something in full support, promotion &; endorsement which was done so based on false information and claims. <p> While you may not know as much about me as you might think, what is happening to you, Aaron, Ali, Lee or anyone else is not new to me. It 's not new to me because I have lived through it and through far worse and what is funny is that the same idiots attacking Aaron, Lee, Ali, you(?) et al are the same ones who went after me in addition to so of the very people you and Ali support, associate with and know personally. I do not think you are a bad person, but I do think and believe from all that I have seen is you do the same things you complain about people doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as a " neutral " journalist because you ceased being that when you began making threats on Twitter or anywhere else. Stacey you continue to inject yourself in the story line and when you do that you are no longer neutral no matter what you say. <p> Let me ask you something, when you went on Twitter talking about how the Liberal Grouch published photos of Jenny and that he was wrong in doing it, did you contact Jenny once and ask her if it was okay for you to publish her pictures on your website in the article calling out Grouch? No you did n't, you simply went ahead and published her picture. By that single act Stacey you made yourself no different from Grouch and what 's worse is that you ca n't see it. <p> No Stacey, I know very well and understand very well the tactics and the purpose, I just simply refuse to allow anyone to draw me in or use that argument for excusing one 's own actions. <p> So did Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit back for more than 9 months and allow Foster Friess name to be drug through the mud and falsely accused of being the funding behind the NBC by Yahoo News, Huffington Post etc? Why is it that even today Ali nor anyone on the " conservative " side have bothered to clear that little false tidbit up other than me? No Stacey I understand fully what is happening and I also understand that both sides accuse each other while both sides are engaging in the exact same acts. <p> Dustin <p> " you made yourself no different from Grouch " <p> Liberal Grouch threatened/harassed bloggers and their families. <p> Whatever you intended to say with that
