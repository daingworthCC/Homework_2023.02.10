5142541 <h> The Past 72 Hours in New York City... Observations <p> Over the past decade, Gen-Y'ers have flocked to cities, driven by the desire to be close to work and in walkable neighborhoods. We have a preference for vibrant, active urban neighborhoods with amenities that enhance the urban experience. However, what happens when catastrophic events disrupt this environment? <p> In the aftermath of Sandy, I 've learned a lot about New York City and general city-living. Since Monday evening, I have largely lived without power, internet access, cell service, and public transportation. Stripping these aspects of life has revealed a lot about the city I live in. Life Without Subways New York City has never felt so crowded ; the sidewalks are overrun by pedestrians seeking an open outlet and a hot shower. Bike lanes are packed with people commuting to work, bus lines stretch around the corner, and finding an open cab is harder than getting good cell signal.

After a meal and a few stiff drinks, I meander to a friend 's apartment where there is a welcoming couch and hot shower waiting. <p> While my neighborhood remains dark, my city life continues to be vibrant ; filled with great friends, good food, and experiences I will never forget from Hurricane Sandy. <h> About the Author <p> Joe Stampone is the creator of A Student of the Real Estate Game, a community of real estate professionals driven by a passion to be on
