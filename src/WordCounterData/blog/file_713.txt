This gift of hers lands her in hot water when she discovers her stepfather 's criminal activities. Becca 's on the run, and learning to survive in a world different from her own. Here, George talks about her YA debut and teases what 's to come in the next book, The Edge of the Water.( Minor spoilers ahead!) <p> ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY : Where did you come up with the idea for The Edge of Nowhere? Elizabeth George : I wanted to write a novel set on Whidbey Island because it 's got terrific atmosphere. I more or less saw it as a challenge to write about a place where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about a place I only visit. I began with deciding that it would be YA, and then I asked myself who the characters were going to be and what would be the challenge they faced in the first book. <p> After your success in the adult fiction world, why make the switch to a YA novel? This is n't a switch from adult to YA as much as it 's an addition. I 've also written nonfiction( Write Away), short stories( I, Richard), and have edited two anthologies. So this was a challenge to myself at the same time as it was an opportunity to use an incredible setting that has been begging me to make it part of a book since I first moved to Whidbey Island in 2005. <p> What differences did you notice while writing in a new genre?

It involves an unusual marine animal, SCUBA diving, a long ago oil slick, and some very unusual characters with big secrets. <p> I thought for sure everything was going to wrap up in a neat little bow, but The Edge of Nowhere ends with a pretty big twist. So where does book two pick up at? It picks up a couple of months later. Becca is where Seth took her and no one knows where that is except Seth. <p> Will we learn more about Becca 's mom? Yes but not in the next book. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in contact with Becca. No one else knows. <p> Anything else you want to add about The Edge of Nowhere or the series? I 'd love people to come to Whidbey and check out the
