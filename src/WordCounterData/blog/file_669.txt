5175341 <h> share this story <p> In 2012 as in 2008 and 2010, Rasmussen has been the nation 's most prolific polling organization at the state level. Almost every day Rasmussen produces two or three new polls of key battleground states in the presidential election along with their national tracking poll. But in addition to being the nation 's most prolific pollster, Rasmussen gets a lot of attention, especially from conservative media outlets and pundits, because its polls consistently produce results more favorable to Republican candidates than the overall averages -- results that frequently do n't match the actual election results very well. In 2010, for example, Nate Silver rated Rasmussen as the least accurate and most biased of all polling organizations that conducted a large number of state polls. <p> So how is Rasmussen doing this year? Along with its national tracking poll that has typically showed Mitt Romney with a lead that is two to three points larger than the overall average, Rasmussen 's polls in the battleground states have also had a consistent Republican lean. I compared Rasmussen 's latest results in the nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado, New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nevada and North Carolina -- with the overall averages from the HuffPost Pollster -- an average that includes Rasmussen polls. In every case, Rasmussen 's poll showed a better result for Romney than the overall average. The Republican lean of Rasmussen 's state polls ranged from one point in Nevada and two points in Florida to four points in Wisconsin and five points in Colorado. Across all nine states, Rasmussen 's polls favored Mitt Romney by about three points more than the overall average. <p> Three points of margin is a very significant difference in a close presidential election. If you were basing your perception of the state of the presidential election entirely on Rasmussen 's polling, you would now see Mitt Romney as a clear favorite. According to Rasmussen, Romney is now leading Obama in five of the nine key battleground states, tied in three and trailing in only one --Nevada. In contrast, the HuffPost Pollster averages give a very different picture of the state of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading in only two -- North Carolina and Florida. To be sure, Obama 's lead in some of those seven states, such as Virginia and Colorado, is very small. But so is Romney 's lead in Florida. It is clear that Rasmussen 's polls give a very different impression of the presidential race in the nation and in the battleground states than the overall averages. <p> In 2012 as in 2010, Rasmussen is producing polls in key states that are significantly more favorable to the Republican candidate than an average of all polls in those states. Perhaps this time Rasmussen will prove to be more accurate than the average. But outliers like Rasmussen usually turn out to be wrong and Rasmussen 's track record certainly should n't give election watchers much confidence in their results. Maybe that 's why Fox News stopped using Rasmussen for their state and national polling this year. Producing polling results that please one side or the other may work for a while, but eventually journalists and voters catch on to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on election night. <p> In 2012 as in 2008 and 2010, Rasmussen has been the nation 's most prolific polling organization at the state level.

If you notice a huge decline in your native Crow populations, you can rest assured knowing the pubs had a wonderful meal via our feathered friends.

Rasmussen was claiming a tied race in Ohio and gave McCain a lead in Florida as late as November 2nd 2008. <h> Loading comments... <p> The big problem with Rasmussen is that they do not sample people who only own cell phones. Any organization calling a cell phone user must pay for the call. Thus, sampling from cell phone only users is expensive. Since Rasmussen is sampling about 400-500 a day, that adds a big cost. The problem with this approach, however, is that cell phone only users tend to be younger, more single or, if married, without children. These sub-populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters by 2-4%. <p> In addition, Rasmussen probably uses a more restrictive definition of a ' likely voter.. It is well known that Republicans tend to vote at a higher percentage than Democrats, but this varies from election to election. Among registered voters, even Rasmussen is showing Obama with a lead over Romney. But, it 's among the ' likely voters ' that Rasmussen shows Romney with the lead. Hence, Rasmussen, along with every other political polling organization, is making a guess as to who will actually vote. Methodologically, there is no single method that has been shown to be better in predicting ' likely voters '. I 'm guessing that Rasmussen is underestimating Democratic turnout. But, we 'll see which organization is the most accurate come November 6th( or actually the 7th when we find out really happened on the 6th). <h> Loading comments... <p> There is no single presidential polling formula that can accurately apply to the population in general. How would you account for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that Obama was a muslim, she was still going to vote for him because Romney was just for the rich guy. Or the anti-war independent who does n't understand that gas prices are the result of the global economy. Or the 60% or so who feel that the country is going in the wrong direction. Do they mean socially or economically? This is why an average of polls is better than any single poll. <p> GeeziePeezie : There is no single presidential polling formula that can accurately <h> Loading comments... <p> Rasmussen was right on the money in 2004 and 2008. Again and again Rasmussen has made predictions that have proven to be correct. Why exactly do you say they are " wrong " when history shows they are more accurate than just about anyone else? <p> Because it makes them feel better to say that their soon-to-be-unemployed candidate is doing better than Romney.
