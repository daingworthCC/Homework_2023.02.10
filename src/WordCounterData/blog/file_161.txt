5124241 <h> Blogs <p> From the outset, people have been waiting to see Michael Floyd make an impact. It was natural, given his status as a No. 1 draft pick. But it was also natural that Floyd 's impact was n't going to be dramatic. Too many factors : The learning curve for a rookie receiver, veterans already playing receiver like Andre Roberts and Early Doucet, fewer passes thrown a game as the Cards lean more on the defense, more multi-tight end packages in part to aid pass protection. <p> But Floyd popped out Sunday against Philly, even though he had just one catch, his first in the NFL. It was a doozy, concentrating in traffic on a ball that could have been picked off, for an eight-yard touchdown. <p> " You have to make sure you concentrate on the ball, plus make sure you do n't get that big-time hit on you, " Floyd said. <p> Floyd is n't going to pontificate about his situation. He says he 's getting more comfortable, and his blocking has been pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a post-play penalty after the two tussled during a run play.) Certainly he wants more catches, but like anyone in his situation, there are stages to go through and it ca n't be forgotten that the Cardinals are 3-0 doing it the way they are currently doing it. <p> " When you do n't get a lot of balls thrown your way, you get frustrated, " Floyd said. " I held in there and got the job done. " <p> Floyd 's play was lost with everything else going on Sunday, and it does n't mean Floyd is suddenly going to dominate the stat sheet. But maybe quality will conquer quantity for Floyd this season. If the Cards get touchdowns like that( he 's becoming a master of the spectacular score, right?) they 'll take it. <h> 22 Responses to " We have a Floyd sighting " <p> I think we are seeing the results of the accumulation of talent on the team( By FAR the deepest we have ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on special teams and defense( and I am hopeful for the offense 's improvement)... <p> Getting the " best ' player will pay dividends sporadically at first perhaps, but will eventually pay big time( E.G. Schofield O'Brian who barely played for 2 years.. any one doubt his value now tho?) <p> Where do you stand on the real story today about the poor officiating last night? If a deal is not struck soon, I am boycotting watching any NFL games next weekend. This is becoming a joke. Maybe my Sundays will be more productive. <p> I disagree with one thing, a top 15 player drafted should have an immediate impact and should be starting. Calvin Johnson, AJ Green, Julio Jones, Justin Blackmon, the list goes on. WR and RB are the 2 positions where a guy should be able to step right in. <p> This team has character guys. I heard mike b speak about that when we did n't take a certain dt in the draft years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had players who did n't buy in after buddy left.mar tay jenkins won that game vs the eagle because he always previously gave up on the route so the eagles did n't focus on him. Contrast to today with a guy like larry on the team we wo n't have those problems. But icant say I assumed floyd would not have a great impact.with a guy like larry u can make floyd run fly route all day and open the whole field up.make him do basic things and pressure the defense to move the saftey and imagine if they lined up together? But the way this team is run strategically he wo n't have the impact. I blame the coach. <p> The Cardinals should have a two game lead on Seattle but do not thanks to last night 's fiasco. We all know that the poor officiating issues go far beyond that terrible call. The integrity, objectivity and fairness of NFL games have been compromised. That will effect viewership and fan interest. <p> last nites call was bullxxxx call im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one game cuz refs do nt know how to make a call, let the fans ref, they could of made a better more honest call then they did <p> I know for a fact that a lot of Packer fans will be boycotting the NFL... not buying merchandise, not buying tickets, etc. Instead they will support the Wisconsin Badgers. The players need to stand together on this and be supported by their respective organizations. The poor officiating is a matter of player safety. I have never seen so many free-for-all brawls in games and total mayham on the field as in the last three weeks. Last night really topped it off in illustrating how little the NFL cares about protecting the integrity of the game. When Golden Tate committed offensive pass interference the play should have ended. The NFL fines players after the fact retroactively when they have n't been flagged in a game so I do n't buy into the fact that the referees call makes it final! I watched Larry Fitz on the NFL am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called it an interception and he is a man who watches enough tape to spot what when on, in addition to being in that kind of pile up himself before. Floyd had a good outing this week and I hope our guys are ready to take it to the Hags House and show them what a defense can do to a bunch of cheaters without the help of the SCABS. The Hags are almost making the Whiners look squeaky clean now! And... this ill gotten win does impact the Cards on a Division Level. <p> Just wait for the future games and everything will balance out. As long as they officiate poorly consistently, right? It will take a few more big flubs for fans to rally against the NFL, demand changes and go to the extreme of boycoting to any significant level. IF that happens though, watch out. The football fan pool is HUGE and could have a signifcant impact. Maybe Romney and Obama should take note?? The good news is that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to sit down and sart talking again. Floyd -- Be a sponge Grasshopper. You got the best mentoring you. Look forward to seeing you develop. <p> I realize this is n't the topic Darren wrote about, but with people talking about " the call, " it brings up the question of whether the " indisputable " evidence standard is too high to overturn the call on the field. On the call in question, it looked like neither referee even wanted to make a call at first, so giving such a high presumption of correctness to the call on the field was unwarranted. And in many other cases, the plays are so bang-bang that it 's asking a lot of any official( experienced or replacement) to get them right -- I mean, on one of those plays where the guy is trying to drag his feet and is juggling the ball a bit, how an official is supposed to watch both things at once is beyond me. I think the call on the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule were changed to something more like " convincing " evidence( instead of " indisputable ") we 'd be better off...? On the other hand, that might put too much discretion in the hands of the replay official. I just think for the NFL to come out and say that, even after reviewing the GB/SEA play after the fact, the replay decision was the correct one( based on the fact that the replay was " inconclusive ") is bogus. The standard is too high if that replay was not enough to get the call overturned. <p> Kevin... When the NFL is using " player safety " and " integrity of the game " or " protecting the shield " to hide behind, I say they need to be called on their willful disregard for player safety as evidenced by the mayhem on the field with players out of control, and being injured and carted off at a record level. The alleged " simultaneous possession " should n't even be an issue since the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate that was not called or even acknowledged but was seen clearly by the entire football viewing world. How much more tarnished can the shield get when rumors of pay-offs and corruption are beginning to circulate much like the baseball scandal a number of years ago. Monday night 's disaster was bound to happen and it was a matter of time... a ticking time bomb that the league was unwilling to defuse. The NFL( including the owners) through arrogance and unwillingness to acknowledge their mistake ca n't do much more to compromise the integrity of the game when players and fans alike have lost respect and NFL writers are beginning to doubt the competence.of it 's leadership. The fact that the Hags are in our league is a big deal. Fist fights and free-for-alls on the field are not OK. What is at stake here is really a matter of integrity and winning in a good and clean way. I hate to see the game I love cheapened in the way the NFL has operated this past year and I @ @ @ @ @
