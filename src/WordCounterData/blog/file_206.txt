5128741 <h> USC 's 3-game stretch might have been nation 's toughest <p> Facing three top-10 teams in a row is enough to make any coach frustrated <p> By : Brian Rauf <p> South Carolina 's loss to Florida on Saturday capped what is perhaps the most grueling three-game stretch any team in the country will face this season. The Gamecocks are the only team to date that have had to play three top-10 teams over three consecutive weeks. <p> The first of these games was the emotional home victory for the Gamecocks on October 6 when they dominated then #5 Georgia, winning 35-7. USC then traveled to Baton Rouge on October 13 and lost a close one to then #9 LSU 23-21. The tough stretch concluded this past Saturday, when the Gamecocks got walloped by #2 Florida, 44-11. <p> Just how tough were these past three weeks? Well, the three-game stint Washington went through from September 27 through October 13 is the only stretch any other team in the country has gone through that is even remotely close to what USC went through, facing teams ranked( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 11th respectively( Stanford, Oregon, and Southern Cal). However, the Huskies had two of those games and home and, like South Carolina, won only one of the three. <p> Looking to the future, no other program faces three straight teams currently ranked in the top-10, but a couple could potentially face the tough task. Arkansas faces South Carolina, Mississippi State, and LSU in consecutive weeks from November 10-24, and with those squads ranked 13th, 11th, and 6th, respectively, there is a possibility all three could be ranked in the top-10 by the time they play the Razorbacks. <p> Baylor has the more realistic shot( unfortunately for the Bears) at facing the feat, facing #8 Oklahoma on the road, then #3 Kansas State and #14 Texas Tech at home from November 10-24. The Red Raiders will of course have to climb in the ranks and the Sooners and Wildcats will have to maintain their spots in the top-10, but Baylor is probably the program most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
