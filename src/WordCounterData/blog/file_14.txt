5109441 <p> The days of being " The Other L.A. Team " are over as the Pacific Division-leading 6-2 Clippers are better than up-and-coming ; now in the range of arrived and ready to contend for a championship. <p> Led by arguably the best point guard in the NBA and the power forward just about everyone would re-draft first across the league, their complimentary pieces ' weakness are well-hidden because extraordinary things are not demanded of them. Instead, the strengths of those pieces are magnified. <p> Looking throughout the Clippers rotation, there is n't a " do n't worry about him " guy without a " worry about him " guy catching an alley-oop over someone 's head or draining a three nearby : <p> Blake Griffin, maybe the most athletic post player in the NBA and a crafty rebounder, is having a slow'ish start and still producing at a high level( 18.9 PER, 16.3 PPG, 9.0 RPG,.495 FG%,.268 DRB%). <p> Jamal Crawford, their leading per game scorer this season is coming off the bench, is getting little more volume than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been( 24.1 PER, 20.5 PPG,.605 eFG%). <p> DeAndre Jordan in the middle is one of the most aggressive seven-foot athletic freaks in the league. Always a lob threat in and out of the pick n ' roll, good rebounder when he has to be, and excellent shot blocker( 19.6 PER,.714eFG%, 6.1 BLK%). <p> Lamar Odom is still a shell of himself, but Griffin 's stamina with Butler, Barnes, and Crawford all being capable forwards does n't produce a need for Odom. <p> Ronny Turiaf is pretty much not making too many mistakes as the 12.6 MPG backup center for Jordon( 20.0% DRB%) <p> The Clippers are the second-best shooting team in the league(.541 eFG%) and 6th-best defensive efficiency( 100.5 DRtg), despite allowing opponents to shoot an about average.486 eFG%, because they 're the most turnover producers( 17.0% TOV%). <p> It 's a great reflection of how this team is generally managed. There is n't a 25 PPG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can score for a team that scores from everywhere. There is n't a tandem of shut down wing players or bigs on defense, but they force turnovers and block shots with aggressiveness and athleticism. <p> There is n't really a formula to beating the Clippers. Isolation deters them from being rewarded for attacking passing lanes, screens set them in motion to take energy away from their offense, closing out on shooters can force shooters to freeze, and help can force the dribble-too-much guys into bad shot selection. The Bulls are n't a very good isolation team, but they do well at everything else. <p> What 's frustrating is that all of this can go right for the 5-3 Bulls and they can still walk out of the Staples Center at 5-4 because it 's more of a game that the Clippers need to mess up than for the Bulls to outplay their opponents. Those mistakes can be forced on both ends, but it 'll take the 48-minute effort on which Coach Tom Thibodeau fixates, usually not needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things need to happen for the Clippers for the Bulls to beat this stacked roster, despite Chauncey Billups and Grant HIll being out with injury. With Crawford creating his own shot all night and the Clippers executing under Vinny Del Negro, it
