5125441 <h> Skyrim ' Hearthfire ' DLC Now Available on Steam <p> Since the game 's launch late last year on the prolific 11.11.11 date, Bethesda has officially launched two DLC packs for Skyrim in the form of ' Dawnguard ' and ' Hearthfire. ' Both expansion packs arrived on the Xbox 360 first due to an exclusivity deal with Microsoft, but ' Dawnguard ' finally arrived for keyboard and mouse fans everywhere in August, and as of today, ' Hearthfire ' has done the same. <p> I do n't want you to freak out or anything, but you can fetch it right now on Steam for $4.99. <p> The biggest draw for ' Hearthfire ' is not new missions, vampires or ice dragons, but home building, adoption, and time with family. You have the ability to design and build your own home wherever a plot of land is available, adopt kids from the local town, and raise a family how you see fit. <p> Praise the Skyrim gods -- you can now play tag as much as you freaking
