5118441 <h> Colorado and Washington State tell DC to Go to Hell <p> Imagine this hypothetical nightmare -- the Federal Government passes an outright ban on the ownership of firearms. You know this violates your natural rights. You know this violates the Constitution. Someone gets the idea that this needs to go to court. It ends up in the Supreme Court. After some creative legal reasoning, 5 of the black-robed gods have determined that the 2nd Amendment means something completely different than it has always meant. <p> The court rules that the so-called federal " law " is constitutional after all. <p> Would you sit idly by and obey? Would you want your state politicians to step in and protect your rights from all-comers? Would you be in favor of joining in with other residents of your state to defy the federal ban? <p> For those who support liberty, it seems natural that people would stand up and say NO to this kind of immoral, unjust, and unconstitutional federal ban. <p> When the Sons Of Liberty boarded ships and refused to return three shiploads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the people told the empire " We do n't want your stinkin ' taxes " <p> This is the type of fortitude that created the American system -- one that was to advance the cause of liberty. <p> And today, the people of Colorado and Washington State took that same kind of stand.

They 've banned toilets over a certain size, and light bulbs of a certain type. They also claim the power to ban the sale and consumption of a plant that might be grown in your own backyard. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a product, the feds have no constitutional authority to ban the purchase of a product either. <p> 18 states have already legalized marijuana for limited, medical use, creating a big thorn in the side of those in DC who hate the constitution and your freedom. But full legalization takes it much further than a simple thorn. It 's a full-on middle finger to Obama, Reid, Boehner and everyone else in Washington DC. <p> The people in Colorado and Washington state have set a precedent like nothing before has. The feds may have a law about something, but you do n't have to obey them. <p> With the legalization of marijuana in both Colorado and Washington, the feds have become the ignored elephant in the room.
