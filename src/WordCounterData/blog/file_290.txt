5137241 <h> Company says fracking not a part of search for oil and natural gas in Oakland County <p> Published : Tuesday, August 28, 2012 <p> By JOSEPH SZCZESNY Of The Oakland Press <p> The northern Michigan company prospecting for oil and gas in the middle of Oakland County does not plan to use the water-intensive practice of " fracking " if the exploratory wells it is drilling are successful. <p> Ben Brower, a representative of Jordan Energy of Traverse City, who represented the Michigan Oil &; Gas Association at a forum on oil and gas drilling in Oakland County, said his company does not expect to use fracking to extract oil and gas from its prospects across the county. <p> Jordan Development of Traverse City, the oil and gas company which operates wells throughout Michigan, paid the state of Michigan $33 per acre during an auction in May for 18,347 acres of state owned mineral rights inside Oakland County. <p> Watch a report on fracking on today 's News at Noon. <p> In addition, the company is also offering to buy the mineral rights from dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 county resident who turned out for the forum Monday night, which was sponsored by the Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service. <p> " We bought all of the( state) leases in Oakland County, " Brower said. " It 's not our intent to do any harm. " <p> Brower also said Jordan has sunk one exploratory well in White Lake Township inside the boundaries of the Indian Springs Metro Park. Jordan Development also has acquired leases inside Kensington Metro Park. <p> Not all wells or prospects are successful. However, given the scope and cost of activity, it appears Jordan Development is relatively confident their investment in Oakland County will pay, said Larry Elkus, a Farmington Hills attorney who specializes in oil and gas cases. <p> Several resident attending the forum expressed concern about the threat drilling poses both to lakes and streams as well as underground aquifers that are used for drinking water and in different parts of the county.

Fracking uses large amounts of water mixed with chemicals to split the rock formations in which natural gas is trapped and bring it to the surface. <p> Bill Mitchell, a geologist from the DEQ 's Office of Oil, Gas and Minerals, said before the state approves a drilling permit it requires an extensive review of the potential harm that might be done to aquifers or surface water. <p> Companies drilling for oil and gas in Michigan also have to gain control the mineral rights to plots of between 40 acres and 650 acres before the state Supervisor of Wells will approve a drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law, owners of private property can be forced in a pool by court order so drilling can proceed. <p> Curtis Talley Jr of the MSU Extension Service said oil and gas companies would rather buy the oil and gas rights from property owners. <p> Jordan is currently paying private land owners roughly $100 per acre for their mineral rights, Brower said. The leases of mineral rights are drafted to favor the oil and gas companies but individual landowners can negotiate for more favorable terms and conditions, Talley said. <p> If the drilling is successful and the exploratory well leads to the production, landowners are entitled to a royalty, which represents as much as 12 percent of the market value of the oil and gas as its sold on the open market. <p> Roger Beukema shares news from Lansing that impacts sportsmen( this means ladies as well) and talks about things he finds when he goes overseas
