5177241 <h> 9.05.2012 <h> The kind of thing that never happens, except it did. <p> How was New York last week you might ask? Well, I hopped on a plane for some vacation( and Shake Shack) time with Alex, and I came back with a job offer and a two week start date- So i 'd say my life 's expectations have been exceeded x1000. <p> The trip was great, other than the fact that I missed my initial interview due to a slight date miscalculation on Alex 's end for which we wo n't point any fingers. After arriving at the airport at 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday night, bags and neck pillow in hand, it was soon realized that our flight acually left Thursday night. There may or may not have been a public tear fest courtesy of yours truly. But the good news is that everything worked out better than expected, aka- I got my dream job. And I still ca n't believe it. We 're moving to New York in two days, we 've sold almost everything we own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live- but it 's okay. Because so far, everything has been working itself out in miraculous ways, and I have a husband who is supporting my dreams and making the whole process a wonderful one- which in and of itself makes me the luckiest. I will also be about 2,000 miles closer to about 5 Shake
