5177441 <h> Groups ' Praise for Cuomo? It Was Written by His Aides <p> ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo 's administration likes to hear compliments so much that it will write them for you. <p> The Democratic administration ghostwrote statements for two business groups that praised the state budget in a mid-April news release from the governor 's office, according to e-mails obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information request. The correspondence provides an unusual look at how elected officials try to burnish their images. <p> The statements were written by Andrew Zambelli, a top aide to the governor, who e-mailed them to two business advocacy groups, the Business Council of New York State and Unshackle Upstate. In the e-mails to both groups, Mr. Zambelli wrote, " We have written a suggested quote, " and he then asked the top official of each group to review the quote and " edit as you see fit. " <p> Mr. Zambelli also made it clear he needed a quick answer, telling Brian Sampson, the executive director of Unshackle Upstate, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No changes were made.

" <p> Robert M. Lillpopp, a spokesman for the Business Council, said, " We usually write our own quote, " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with every single point that was in there and that 's -- again, it 's our normal practice when asked to put a quote in, to communicate with the people who have asked us, " he said. " In this case, they may have given it to us in a way that we felt was appropriate. " <p> Mr. Sampson, with Unshackle Upstate, was quoted in the news release saying, in part, " For two years in a row, Governor Cuomo has shown New Yorkers that he is serious about rebuilding the state 's fiscal house, and we applaud his leadership. " <p> Mr. Sampson said Friday that it was " not a practice we normally do. " <p> " I think what happened in that instance is what he wrote up was very similar to what we would have written, " he added. " I believe I was traveling that day, so I
