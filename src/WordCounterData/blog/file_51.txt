5113141 <p> Girls, have you ever felt like temptation is everywhere? Well, that 's because it is -- but you have the tools to fight back against it! <p> Temptation is a sub-theme of my upcoming novel, Freeing Tanner Rose. And common to man : but God is faithful, who will above that you are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it( 1 Corinthians 10:13). <p> This means God would never allow us to be tempted without the strength to successfully resist. How amazing is that? <p> I remember one time in high school, a boy -- who I thought was cute! -- asked me out. I was n't allowed to date until I was 17, but I found myself thinking of ways I could still go out with him without my mother knowing. <p> I could have finagled it. My mother trusted me to go out with my friends, so I could have pretended I was with them. But I then realized that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of finding out, do n't they? -- that trust would be gone, and so would my freedom. It just was n't worth it! I told the boy the truth. And he was fine with it. <p> All temptation can be resisted. It may not be easy, but it is possible. And that possibility lies in God 's strength and unconditional love. <p> But that does n't mean that Satan wo n't stop trying. For as long as people succumb to temptation, Satan will continue to tempt us all. <p> Do n't forget, ladies, that even our own Savior Jesus Christ was tempted in the desert by the devil : <p> I urge you to stand strong against temptation. Call upon God to help you find the strength, and walk away from it. You can do it! God made sure of it and He is faithful! <p> What ways do you feel that you 're tempted? Do you give in to those temptations or do you struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is to also avoid temptation as much as we possible can. if being online late at night can lead to temptation, then have an internet curfew. If hanging out with certain people( and in certain places) can put you in compromising situations, then do n't hang out with them. I know sometimes we ca n't help it, but when we can, we should. Better to avoid it than to risk it and possibly end up giving in.( To be clear, though, being tempted is not sin. Sinning is sin.) <p> Wait, I 'm confused. " This means God would never allow us to be tempted without the strength to successfully resist. " Does that mean that we 've succeeded every time? Does that mean that the times where you think you 've actually succumbed to sin, you have n't, because it should n't have actually happened? Does that mean we never succumb to sin? I 'm confused! <p> It means you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have free will to ignore that strength and succumb. No one can say, " the temptation was too hard to resist, " because God ensures that the temptation is not too hard. If it 's too much to succumb alone, then you call out to Him for help, His strength. I hope that helps! <p> It means that the Lord will always be there to help us say no to temptation. He always provides a way out. Because we are human, we do give into temptation. But even then, God can use those experiences to help us learn to not do it again. Yes, we fail in the area of temptation, but God is on our side and will help and support us to fight temptation! He is so awesome and loving to not leave us to battle it out devil on our own! <p> " For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not sin. Let us then approach God 's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of Hebrews 4:15-16 " Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. " James 4:7 <h> 11.23.2012 4PM PT <h> Verse of the Day <p> " BOOK I Psalms 1 -- 41 Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on
