5181341 <p> If we hoped for a soft winter, a warning from Polish meteorologists gives us creeps. They believe this winter will be the coldest in the last 1000 years. <p> In the 2010-2011 we can freeze more than ever. <p> All this because the change of oceanic current Gulfstream, that keeps a climatic equilibrum on Earth. Soon, the hot waters transported by Gulf Stream wo n't fight the cold air from the Arctic Ocean. The first signs of the phenomena can already be seen in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the specialists say. <p> Gulf Stream or Gulf 's Current works as a ' radiator ' for the north part of Europe, and this disappearance or even a slight diminish can have as a consequence a new Ice Age. <p> Such a catastrophe might be hurried by the explosion of the petrol platform from Gulf of Mexico, just the place were Gulf Stream is formed. Then over 700k tons of petrol were discharged into the Ocean. The situation can change dramatically.

Its a bit like going to the pond with your model boat and becoming a captain! <p> The above article could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headline, but even if something slips on the radar at sott, it encourages the readers to see for themselves the propaganda that is being spread such as in this case with global warming. The lies are continually being pointed out at sott, through commentaries and articles, so as to educate the readership to detect the lies for themselves. It appears to be working ;) <p> Ice ages cause droughts. All the water gets locked up in the ice, and very little can then fall as rain.... the prediction of droughts may well be accurate, and if there is a coming ice age,
