5186441 <h> It 's Faith, But It Is Hardly Blind <p> One of the most irritable traits of children is that they 're always asking, " Why? ". I do n't have much patience for it. As much as I love teaching, I prefer to give them the tools to answer the questions for themselves rather than doing the un-riddling for myself. <p> Despite the irritation, I 've always carried a hidden sense of admiration for those who unwaveringly pursue answers, and when the answers ca n't be found continue to fight for a better understanding. The incessant " Why? " has always been better( to me) than complacency or apathy. <p> I think this is why the broadly accepted views of " childlike faith " have always perplexed me. I always hear the term used in a conversation when a seemingly unanswerable question is brought to the table. <p> " Childlike faith " in its most common usage seems to me to be a dismissal more than a discipline. <p> I wonder, as I often do, if we 've misunderstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hardly the sort of wording I think one would use to describe a sort of blind-trust.

For everyone who asks receives ; he who seeks finds ; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ask, seek and knock. God is saying, quite simply... <p> " Search me out. " <p> And he says this not so that we dive into a cyclical odyssey of dissatisfied unknowing. Also, not to give us hope of an easy road to simple answers. It 's the invitation of a friend who wants to be known ; but who will not cheapen the knowing by giving it away easily. <p> For those of us trying to find this " childlike faith ", our best option is to cultivate our curiosity. It 's a call to
