5182341 <p> Who needs a light switch when you have smart bulbs paired with smartphones? LIFX is just that : a Wi-Fi connected LED bulb that you remotely control or even change the color. But will consumers want one-off connected gadgets or centrally-managed smart homes in the future? <p> A new Kickstarter project aims to offer Wi-Fi connected light bulbs to the masses and the best part is, you can change the bulb 's color with the help of a smartphone. The bulb is called LIFX and thanks to the LED technology inside, it 's an energy saver when compared to traditional or CFL bulbs. You control the brightness and color directly from an iPhone or Android device using the LIFX application and there 's smarts in the bulb itself : It can notify you when a new Twitter message arrives, for example. <p> Take a look at the LIFX explanation video and you can see that the creators my be correct in calling LIFX the " smartest light bulb ever made " : <p> The project impresses me for a few reasons. LIFX, which can be backed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its $100,000 goal for backing, taking in over three times that much with nearly two months left for fundraising. It also brings a wide variety of functionality to something most people consider mundane but necessary : a light bulb. And it appears simple to use through the dedicated smartphone application or can still be turned on or off through the existing light switch. <p> I actually use both scenarios today but many visitors to my home find it all confusing when I explain. I have a small server device that controls and monitors my home automation system : heating/cooling, various indoor and outdoor lights, and a garage door sensor, to name a few. The system is controlled in one place and all of the parts are manageable in a single app or web page. <p> For now, I think standalone connected gadgets such as LIFX are more appealing to most, simply because they bring new smarts into the home and, let 's face it, one more smartphone app installation is n't a big deal. Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a single interface -- possibly voice -- will make all of these gadgets work even smarter by having them work together. <p> Kevin, I found your comment about your visitors being confused by your mixed modes of interfacing interesting. <p> The LIFX bulb obviously has some type of server embedded in the design, to be able to interface to a networked smart phone. Seems like it would connect through WiFi to the net. <p> Network connectivity and power have been the bane of standalone sensor/loads for years. LIFX seems to have finally broken at least the standalone networking device part of it. <p> As you pointed out most people just do n't get why you 'd have a " server " running in your home. It 's been my experience that even most Linux people do n't really think much about using " servers " at the home or consumer level. Plenty of inexpensive Linux( multi-user, multi-tasking) boards are finally coming on line, so maybe we 'll see a change to more centralized device management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inexpensive) possibilities. For more stationary applications, there are also the Plug Computer and Fit-PC lines. <p> No doubt the LIFX bulb is a giant step in the right direction. I hope they license or make their connectivity solutions available so lots more cool devices can be invented. <p> What would be the extra consumption for being constantly attached to the Wi-Fi network? How much strain do these put on Wi-Fi capacity( especially when it starts to be a lot of wirelessly connected bulbs)? <p> Just read an article on how WIFI router passwords can be easily hacked. Even 8 and 12 character ones in a few hours. What is going to happen to this market when some nerds decide it is humorous to make the neighbors lights switch on and off all night long and it make the drudge report? " Regarding security : LIFX will be as secure as your WiFi network. eg. without the WiFi network password you ca n't control the smartbulbs.
