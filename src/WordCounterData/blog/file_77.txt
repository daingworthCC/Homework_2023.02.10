5115741 <h> Q &A; with the Interim Director of the Nurse Educator Program <p> Nurse educators combine their clinical expertise with their passion for teaching. We 're pleased to share with you some reflections on the current state of this important role from the interim director of the Nurse Educator program, John Rosselli, MS, RN, CFNP, ACRN, CNE. <p> Why should someone consider pursuing a nurse educator role? <p> We need more nurse educators to train the next generation of nurses. If we do n't increase the number of nurse educators, we will continue to be forced to limit student capacity, which only adds to the growing nursing shortage. <p> It can not be underestimated the important role nurse educators play in providing quality educational experiences to the current and next generation of nurses. The profession is looking for nurses who are willing to combine their clinical expertise with their passion for teaching others -- nurses just like you. <p> Some are concerned that becoming a nurse educator means you can no longer continue practicing. Is this the case? <p> The old adage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does not hold true in the profession of nursing. Many nurses continue to care for patients in practice setting and the community after they become educators. If they choose to no longer practice, nurse educators must stay clinically current with the new nursing methods and technologies through continuing education programs and clinical specialty conferences. Nurse educators remain on the leading edge of clinical practice. <p> What are the possible career paths for a nurse educator? <p> Nurse educators work in the faculty role in formal academic programs that lead to a degree or certificate. Nurse educators also work as professional staff development specialists within health care facilities( e.g., hospitals, extended nursing facilities) where they teach professional continuing education programs designed to meet individual professional leaning needs. Some nurse educators work as community educators who work with communities to increase awareness of health and wellness. <p> What makes the Nursing@Georgetown Nurse Educator program special? <p> What makes the Nursing@Georgetown Nurse Educator program special is its commitment to provide an opportunity for potential students to combine their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional development settings. Students seeking a master 's degree take core courses in advanced pharmacology, pathophysiology, health assessment, and other areas that build a framework for excellence in nursing education practice. <p> The Nurse Educator program specialty coursework provides opportunities for students to master skills important to the nurse educator professional. Students will learn about curriculum development, the teaching and learning process, simulation, classroom management, and the fundamentals of nursing education leadership. <p> Each student will be responsible for completing 275 practicum hours.

Practicum activities include the development and facilitation of learning modules, the use of instructional technologies, and the design and implementation of simulation experiences and distance learning modules. <p> The program is also committed to offering opportunities in global service learning. <p> We invite you to learn more about the Nursing@Georgetown program,
