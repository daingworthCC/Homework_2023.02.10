5115941 <h> September 10, 2012 <h> On the Possibility of a Single Perfect Being <p> This is( sort of) a re-post. I say " sort of " because I have mentioned this argument before. But I have strengthened and tightened it( or have tried to). So here it is in its current form. The argument crucially depends on what I call the Endowment Thesis : <p>( 1) x has value iff x has value by virtue of being endowed value by one or more agents <p> Unpacking the Endowment Thesis in two parts. First, necessary and sufficient for anything to have value is the existence of one or more agents. As such, the Endowment Thesis entails that value is a relational property. Second, the " by virtue of " here picks out the grounding relation, where explanatory asymmetricality obtains between modally symmetrical relata. Of the relation between x 's having value and x 's being endowed value by one or more agents, the following is true :( i) neither can exist without the other, and( ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why x has value, but x 's having value does not explain the endowing activity of the agents. Carrying on, where G is God, now assume with all theists that <p>( 2) There is a possible world in which G has value <p> where G is a lonely object( an object with no wholly-distinct worldmates. So, God sans creation, say). I take many of the properties thought to be perfections of God, such as happiness, generosity, love, goodness, benevolence, etc. to all be species of the value genus. Now, a lonely object can have a relational properties only if it has proper parts. From( 1) and( 2) it follows that G has proper parts, and that G has value by virtue of being endowed value by one or more agents. It is a tautological implication of( 1) that <p>( 3) Either G has value by virtue of being endowed value by one agent, or G has value by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We can eliminate the former disjunct by reductio. Assume it is true. If G has value by virtue of being endowed value by one agent, then G, as a lonely object, has value by virtue of endowing himself value. But this is not possible, because the grounding relation is irreflexive. Thus, <p>( 4) Therefore, It is not possible that G has value by virtue of being endowed value by one agent( 5) Therefore, G has value by virtue of being endowed value by more than one agent <p> The most natural application of the preceding is to see God as the whole of which at last two agents are proper parts. As far as philosophical arguments go, I think this is a pretty good argument. A slightly more fleshed out version of the above can be found here, which I hope to present soon at a conference. A long-winded, less tightly-argued but more philosophically rich version can be found here, which I do not hope to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like this : <p> I do n't see how this goes. The grounding claim would be that &lt;G endows G with value&gt; grounds &lt;G has value&gt;. I do n't see any issue with irreflexivity. Unless you assume that part of what grounds endowing with value is having value, and those who subscribe to the Endowment Thesis will deny this, since it leads to a regress. <p> I should hope so( if I understand you correctly, I think I do just that in the paper) : I think only multi-agent models can secure a claim of the form : X endows G with value explains G has value. So I do n't want to argue for claim that in general X endows G with value does not explain G has value. My argument against( 2) is that it is the particular case of G endows G with value that fails to explain G has value. <p> Might the theist not just say that God has no value absent creation, and then claim that the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but maintain that God has no real relations with the world( thus God, for instance, never changes does not become the creator or become the savior, or ' become ' anything at all)? As far as I can tell William Lane Craig has identified this view as entertained by St. Thomas Aquinas. Also, along the same lines, could n't one agent who is not God be the grounding for the value relation, and if so, what of premise 4? <p> Tyler, I would consider the argument a smashing success if it resulted in the theist conceding that God has no value absent creation. It would effectively answer " yes " to
