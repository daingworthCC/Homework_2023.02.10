5166341 <h> Rethinking the role of labeling processes in major product rollouts <p> Labels are key for ensuring that items are handled appropriately within supply chains. <p> The recent release of the highly anticipated iPhone 5 offers a good example of a complex product rollout. For those who are unfamiliar with international commercial shipping practices, the sheer volume involved in this particular product debut may be mind-boggling. <p> Three days after the September 21 launch of the iPhone 5, Apple announced that it had already sold more than 5 million of the devices. The initial deployment was restricted to a handful of countries, but within a week the rollout had been expanded to over 30 nations. And, by the end of the year, Apple expects to be actively selling iPhone 5s throughout over 100 countries around the world. <p> This pace of distribution is breathtaking. Underpinning the entire operation, however, is a carefully orchestrated system ensuring that, as each product moves through the supply chain, it is properly handled and able to arrive where it needs to be, both intact and on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a production site in another country, crafted into specific components and transported to yet another facility in a different region to be assembled into a finished product, which can then be sold all over the world. <p> Throughout this process, there is a constant need to minimize waste and prevent errors that will find their way into finished products. <p> Ensure proper handling of sensitive materials <p> One complaint about the iPhone 5 rollout process is that the device 's new, aluminum case is easily scratched. In fact, media reports indicate that many early purchasers received their devices pre-scratched. <p> Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, which uses the trade name Foxconn Technology Group, is a major Apple supplier. The firm 's massive factory complexes in China are the main source of iPhone 5s. <p> An official from the company -- who declined to be named, due to the sensitive nature of the high-tech industry -- told The Wall Street Journal that " the iPhone 5 is the most difficult device that Foxconn has ever assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the design is very complicated, " the executive said. <p> However, the insider claims the Foxconn facilities have been consistently improving their productivity levels as they gain experience with the new processes, telling The Journal that " practice makes perfect. " <p> Labels help a company identify problems within its supply chain <p> Barcode labels can be used to establish traceability for product shipments, which helps companies identify the source of specific production problems and address the underlying causes as rapidly as possible. <p> Another key area of product rollouts is being able to quickly conduct a targeted recall, in the event that the debut is marred by serious defects. <p> How barcodes facilitate better recalls <p> In the event that a recall proves to be necessary, it is crucial for a company to be able to execute the process quickly and effectively. Consumer dissatisfaction will begin to mount rapidly if damaged or defective items remain on store shelves after the manufacturer has initiated a recall. <p> Barcode labeling allows an item 's progress to be logged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, in the event of a recall, each device that is affected can be quickly located. Subsequently, retailers with remaining stock can be alerted of the need to return shipments and prevent additional sales of subpar products. <p> The bottom line <p> Labeling is an increasingly important part of production and distribution cycles for modern products. Implementing an enterprise-level solution helps companies ensure they can print accurate labels at an appropriate scale to pull off major product rollouts without incident. <h> What do you think? <h> Subscribe <h> Mobile App <h> Loftware Article : Customer Responsiveness <h> Customer Responsiveness : A Requirement for Growth <p> In working closely with thousands of global companies, Loftware has seen this heightened focus on enterprise labeling as a means to improve customer responsiveness and overall satisfaction.
