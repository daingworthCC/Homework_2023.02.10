5114241 <h> Bryan Singer Returns To X-MEN! <p> Published at : Oct 31, 2012 8:10:29 AM CDT <p> Nordling here. <p> Yes, I realize we 're late on this one, as it was announced yesterday, but due to the juggernaut( bitch) that was the STAR WARS announcement, and real life concerns, I was n't able to get to this until now. Deadline reports that Bryan Singer has signed on the line that is dotted for X-MEN : DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, bringing him back into the franchise that he made such a mark on. <p> Singer making the next X-MEN movie is definitely welcome news -- many fans still consider X2 to be the best of the franchise, although I 'm pretty partial now to FIRST CLASS and DAYS OF FUTURE PAST will be continuing that story arc began in the last movie. It 's expected that Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and James McAvoy to return, and this movie will likely link the prequels to Singer 's and Brett Ratner 's movies. <p> I 'm even more curious now about THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set, and the teaser poster looks like something Mondo would do, so I think this franchise is definitely back on track. I 'm pleased that Singer is returning to the franchise that has treated him so well, and I 'm very excited to see this very popular story come to the screen in a way that should make fans happy. <p> Seriously... does Disney give MORE of a crap than Lucas did about his trilogy?... not really kids. but Singer 's 2nd X-men film really hit the nail on the head when it came to being tonally connected to the comics! Can not WAIT for Days of Future Past now!!!! <p> Singer is not a good director. X1 &; 2 and Superman Returns are directed with all the verve of a dead fish. They are leaden to say the least. Usual Suspects is good but that comes down largely to the script and the performances. I could watch a Singer film and have to idea who had directed it. He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things that fan boys like to hear. First Class was by no means a masterpiece, but Vaughn is by far the more talented man. <p> I 'm even more curious now about THE WOLVERINE based on some of the news coming from that set, and the teaser poster looks like something Mondo would do, so I think this franchise is definitely back on track. <p>... So based on a poster, this movie looks to be good? Righhhtttt... The first Wolverine was a shit stain... the sequel has LOTS of ground to make up. <p> Nordling : I 'm even more curious now about THE WOLVERINE based on some of the news coming from that set, and the teaser poster looks like something Mondo would do, so I think this franchise is definitely back on track....

Days of future past has to introduce the real dark phonenix not what we saw in X3( which was lawnmover man bad). Ca n't wait!!! <p> About as much as The Last Stand resembled the DarkPheonix storyline... <p> Cyclops, Jean and Storm have n't been introduced yet. The XMen team in First Class were mostly uninteresting with Beast and Havok being the highlight. They said they were n't adding mutants to the team, so that 's a problem. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any of the original cast returning? <p> I 'm betting on Jean Grey cameo in Wolverine to tie together with this, with Jean taking over Kitty Prydes role in the story with afamke playing a older Jean who comes back to contact her younger self. <p> About as much as The Last Stand resembled the DarkPheonix storyline...

This is horrible. :( <p> Give the job to someone who will celebrate the fantastical elements of the series and not excise them to be easily digestible for audiences not familiar with the comics. Singer made dull X-Men movies and an even more dull Superman. This is horrible. :( <p>... Hard to do a story involving aliens and such proper justice when the universe set up by Singer 's two movies tried to desperately ground the series, placing too much emphasis on realism. The trainwreck of 3 was set up by Singer. <p> And 3 is EASILY the most fun and X-Men feeling of the three. However, First Class was the single best X-Men movie we 've ever gotten. Looks like it 'll be the only good one we 'll get, now. Ugh. <p>...

Ugh. <p> Look I loved First Class even more so than X2. So if they simply use this to wipe away the garbage that was X3 &; X-Men Origins Wolverine than I 'm a happy camper. Even if it means you 'd have to lose X2 continuity I 'm ok with it. Because even the first X-Men upon rewatching really was n't that great. <p> The ridiculous script requirements the studio gave the writters did. They admit to making mistakes with how thaT story treated certain characters. Vaughn hightailed it out of there when he saw what a mess it all was. I think Ratner did a decent job with the material and the severe time constraints he had. I actually enjoyed the Cure plotline, its the stories focus on wolverine, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that movie for me. The thing is wolverine and pheonix are the weakest parts of the film. They should have focused on the cure story. <p> He may be directing Mark Millar 's The Secret Service, a comic book that I 'm heavily addicted to, which is a huge homage to James Bond. It means we might FINALLY get a James Bond parody on the big screen that plays it straight instead of going too campy. And if they sign Mark Hamill for the opening pre-credits sequence, that 's all the better. <p> He makes GOOD MOVIES. Above all else the new SW film needs to be a GOOD MOVIE. He wo n't just throw a ton of CGI crap at the screen. After the unrelenting crap that was the prequels we need a GOOD MOVIE ABOVE ALL ELSE. <p> As I said yesterday First Class is total Shite. What people see in Fassbender I 'll never know. He really did n't impress me as Magneto. He was ok in Prometheus but i suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch for him. Somebody please tell Singer to ditch this crappy cast and just get on with the REAL X-MEN PLEASE! Just when they could have gotten into some really kickass storylines with the original cast they screw it up with First Crap. I just do n't get it.... hell I would take X3 over that first crap anyday( and X3 had alot of problems true enough). I 'm sorry but James McAvoy and Fassbender are n't in the same ballpark as Patrick and Ian, they are n't in the same league... hell they ai n't even in the same SPORT. But let 's be honest here, with Avengers 2( THANOS BABY!!), Captain America 2, Iron Man 3( MANDARIN BABY!!), Amazing Spider-Man 2( hopefully titled Web of Spider-Man or Spectacular), Man of Steel, THE 3 HOBBITS, AND STAR WARS EPISODES 7, 8, 9 coming does anyone give a rat 's cock of muthafuckin huntch about First Crap 2? Yeah me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total Shite. What people see in Fassbender I 'll never know. He really did n't impress me as Magneto. He was ok in Prometheus but i suspect him playing a soul-less android was n't much of a stretch for him.

Argo showed it even more. Five years ago he would have been a stupid choice, now he 's a man on the move, upward. He is a better director than Lucas. So shut up. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sense, Affleck was strictly second string until that film showed what he can do. Argo showed it even more.

Singer did n't make BAD movies exactly. But they did n't resemble the comics at ALL. Horrible terrible casting choices, dull, ' reality ' based settings, the premise was meh. And through it all, Singer very clearly intended the X-Men movies to be an allegory for how hard it was to grow up being gay and trying to be accepted because of so much gayness. Dude, just go make an endless stream of movies about your angsty gayness. You already did it to Superman, and two X-Men movies. Leave the comic book movies to people who actually care about the comics, someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fidelity that Whedon brought to Avengers. <p> 1 - Is Luthor a frustrated Century 21 agent? This is the second time he 's come up with a real estate deal as his major plot. This is the best a super genius can come up with? He 's just pilfered Kryptonian tech, he can manufacture things which will make him so rich he can use Morcrosoft/Apple stock for toilet paper. And what 's this about hiring thugs who would be hard pressed to set up a convenience store robbery as underlings? <p> 2 - Superman is standing on an island of Kryptonite which has him so weak he 's punched out by a common thug - and he does n't notice?! <p> 3 - Kryptonian crystals take on the properties of the matter next to them? So why has n't Supe 's Fortress collapsed under its own weight? By that logic it 's made of snow, after all. <p> 4 - Perry White( black?! Whose idea of a joke was that?!) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be immediately replaced as Editor-in-Chief. <p> 5 - Lois taking her kid to the site of an inherently dangerous assignment??? <p> 6 - Speaking of Kryptonian tech, how does Luthor just waltz in the Fortress and walk out with stuff. Have n't the super advanced Kryptonians ever hears of locks or biometrics? <p> And on and on. Just one dumb movie. <p> Oh and did I mention a building full of investigative reporters who do n't put two and two together when both Supes AND Clark wind up missing for the exact same number of years? <p> SUPERMAN RETURNS( a.k.a. THE MONOLITH MONSTERS II) was simply dreadful! 1 - Is Luthor a frustrated Century 21 agent? This is the second time he 's come up with a real estate deal as his major plot.

Those movies are full of missed opportunities, miscasting and lack a certain something - I think the sense of fun and adventure that permeates the other Marvel movies. This is a huge mistake. This is going 12 years in the past and mining stale ideas. We need new blood and a fresh perspective. I thought Vaughn was a breath of fresh air, this project just lost my interest until I see some reviews. <p> Agreed.

Do n't get me wrong, Vaughn is one of the more creative action directors working today, I love what he did with Stardust and Kick-Ass. However, Singer is a decent action director, and I 'm more concerned with the story then anything else. <p> I agree he is a competent director, I just question the casting decisions he made - Halle Berry? Also Black Motor Cross suits as the costumes, and the gun-metal grey cinematography. I have no doubt he 'll turn in a decent movie, I was just hoping for a completely fresh take on all the favorite characters. They admittedly could do far worse then Singer. <p> I agree he is a competent director, I just question the casting decisions he made - Halle Berry?

No.. what we 've gotten are brilliant scenes/set-pieces in great to good/decent to workable/mediocre to crap films( read : great - x2, good/decent - xmen &; xm:fc, workable/mediocre - x3, crap - wolvie:origins) What we need is someone to come in and keep the crap scenes out and keep the " good " scenes in. If they 're not sure, it 's a rather simple formula, for the most part, beyond its inherent subjectivity, of course... Magneto nazi hunting? Great scenes. Wolverine blubbering about the death of Jean Gray? Bad scene. Nightstalker attacking the white house? BRILLIANT scene( and great use of ' Dies Irae ' too). Hippy-hippy shake dance party scene from FC? Bad scene. Magneto " rearranging " the SF bridge? Great scene. So there 's a lot of " there " there if they just keep themselves in check. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, not a " movie " context and you 'll see many great scenes in even the bad movies and bad scenes in even the good movies. I think Singer has shown the most self-restraint with these movies. Plus, Singer was nothing if not utterly serious throughout his presentation of Xmen and Xmen2. I think this bodes very well, personally. <p> Apt Pupil : Gay Nazi befriends an underage boy and teaches him about stuff and then commits suicide after being persecuted for being outed as a gay... I mean Nazi. <p> Usual Suspects : Gay Kevin Spacey misleads his heterosexual friends by pretending to be someone he 's not and then stabs them all in the back. <p> Jack the Giant Killer : Gay Jack from Jack in the Beanstalk plants his seeds and they grow into a giant stalk... obviously symbolic of a giant cock. He 's then chased around by giants with giant cocks throughout the whole movie. <p> Singer is a talented film maker, but he really needs to get passed his obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gayness and make a good fun movie. The problem with all his films is that they 're loaded down so heavily with gay subtext. Superman Returns : Gay Superman fights against gay Kevin Spacey Luthor and spends most of his time dour and on the outside of society looking in longingly. X-Men 1 and 2 - Gay superheroes are persecuted for being being... I mean muntants. Apt Pupil : Gay Nazi befriends an underage boy and teaches him about stuff and then commits suicide after being persecuted for being outed as a gay... I mean Nazi.

This bitch is just crawling back for a check because he 's shown his hand as a two dimensional hack. Bryan Singer hates superheroes he just knows how to play the game and say the right things so that some of you short sighted imagination deprived rubes actually buy into his lazy, pedestrian " realistic " storytelling. Maybe this will bomb and Fox will give it back to Marvel so someone who actually gives a shit can take the helm. I officially do n't give fuck all about this franchise... again. <p> So much for a decent reboot. This bitch is just crawling back for a check because he 's shown his hand as a two dimensional hack.

He has done a hugely successful superhero ensmble cast movie, *gets* the Xmen *very* well and has already written a run of their stories... Personally, I thought X1 and X2 were n't very good, so I could n't give a fart about Singer coming back. At best, he can offer a return to past mediocrity. <p> He 's known for that and people even got all lippy about " Black Widow saving all the actual superheroes " or some such nonsense. <p> But have we really gotten true characterizations of the Xmen female badasses? <p> I have n't read probably even 20% of the Xmen comics but I did watch the old animated series( which was excellent) extensively back in the day... certainly enough to know that all of the females portrayed in these movies are not remotely like they are in the comics. <p> Storm was worshipped as a Goddess, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound up inside her. <p> Rogue was n't a shy and demure girl unsure of herself or her abilities. She was a " riot gyrl " in the truest sense of the word( I was hoping shed 'd have her epi with Ms Marvel and get her super-strength and flight abilities permanently). <p> Mystique? While she fares a little better under Singer 's guidance, she 's still kinda hell-n-gone from being what she is in the comic. As I understand it, there were entire series of Xmen stories that her as the main baddie akin to someone like Magneto. Not sure why she 's in permanent " thug " status. <p> The White Queen? Probably First Class 's biggest character fault. I 'm the first to insist big boobs are always great and always welcome in anything. But as a replacement for the personality of one of the more sheer badass female villains( and occasional good guy)? Ahh.. no. Not gon na cut it. Shameful what they did to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to Jean Gray and Dark Phoenix. Such possibility hinted at the end of X2 and such possiblity wasted on yet another mute female " goon ". <p> If Whedon ever even got near a script for this new outing, the females would exponentially grow in cinematic badassery almost instantly and it would be a very welcome improvement. <p> He 's known for that and people even got all lippy about " Black Widow saving all the actual superheroes " or some such nonsense.

Jackman is great in his own way, but is a weird re-imagining of the character. And, Jackman should have been Jack Reacher! <p> Hmm, I should pop in one the X-Men movies. While the fourth was huge leap forward, SInger has did nothing but mishandle this franchise. Of course they made some money. It 's freakin X-Men! If they actually put some love into the true essence of the X-Men characters this film be a huge return. Look at Batman and what Marvel has been doing. Singer is not the answer. <p> Hmm, I should pop in one the X-Men movies. While the fourth was huge leap forward, SInger has did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money. It 's freakin X-Men!

The problem is Singer isnt a real comic book fan, he knew nothing about the XMen when he did the 1st 2 movies so he needs to man up and do the story the justice it deserves. <p> As for casting IM was good as Magneto and did go to school in my home town, but the actor who should have been Magneto is Rutger Hauer as he resembles the character like SLJ resembles Nick Fury. <p> For fucks sake Fox, Rothman has gone, look to what Marvel and Disney have done, its a fucking no brainer! <p> X3 was ok but destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer needs to nail DOFP and defo have the Wolverine kill money shot to make it work.

It 's pretty fucking obvious that Singer and Co. set up the Pheonix/Split Personality angle from the get go.

Vaughn was a step in the right direction, but the man is better equipped for comedy/drama then action. I would have liked to see Rupert Wyatt brought on for this. <p> Look I dono't like the guy.

Have to say it 's 2/3rds of a good movie but horribly truncates the relationship of- fuck it everyone knows this. Point is, this film does n't have to jerkoff the fanboy in me, it has to be a good time at the movies.

The problem with all his posts are that they 're loaded down so heavily with gay subtext. Seriously, dude. Get over yourself. Anyone who thinks Superman Returns was gay subtext is bothered by the idea of a guy wearing tights in the first place. <p> Sheesh, fans are divided on these boards!! Thats expected. X1 was ok, X2 blew it outta the water! Great fucking film! It had it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing good about that was Kelsey Grammer 's take on The Beast. No way is that a good X-Men movie, NO WAY. Vaughn 's FC was meh. Good, nothing spectacular. I would like to see Hugh Jackman reprising his role as Wolverine and teaming up with the cast from FC doing DOFP. Simply gold! <p> and Wolverines intro in X1 was spot-on. Wish Singer handled X3 it would have been a smarter film and even if it would have had less action it would have had better quality all around. My only concern is I 've heard that Singer is not the easiest Director to get along with for actors. Halle Barry apparently hated him. <p> and Wolverines intro in X1 was spot-on.

I 'm still waiting for that good X-Men movie that 's going to wow me. Singer 's movies does n't undulate fluidly from point a to b and have terrible action scenes( sans from the Nightcrawler fight). First Class,( aside form 3 main characters) have flat characters with a bad ending. <p> They we 're all okay, being that they 're the only available X-Men movies.

Fox just DOES NOT GET IT. First class was a step in the right direction, for sure, but it was still not an X men movie. Wolverine was a huge disappointment. just bad leadership at fox. <p> i 'll give him credit, he had the balls to do X men 1 and 2 when superhero movies were not in vogue. 1 was terrible( watch it again), and 2 was much better, but still a very stiff movie with terrible wire work/ action and dialogue. just a bad movie- try watching with people who do nt care about the x men/ comics... its embarrassing.

Too bad, they did n't really do anything with Nightcrawler after that. <p> OK, so in five X-Men/Wolverine flicks, there has been all of one memorable action scene. I guess you could throw in Magneto 's prison break and the super stabby Wolverine v. Deathstrike bout in X2 if you wanted, but, nothing else really stands out for me, certainly not the limp endings to X-Men, X2, X3 or First Class. <p> Everyone talks about how great the opening to X2 is... and it was- really tapped into something at the time- and it was just a terrific introduction to Nightcrawler, who was always one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too bad, they did n't really do anything with Nightcrawler after that. &lt;BR&gt; OK, so in five X-Men/Wolverine flicks, there has been all of one memorable action scene.
