5174741 <h> Looking Out for the Next Bailout <p> One of the lessons I have learned from the current financial crisis is that it is worth paying close attention to warnings concerning obscure, quasi-public agencies that are( 1) known by their abbreviations, and( 2) perform dull but critical functions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are prime examples. <p> P.B.G.C. was established by Congress to insure participants in defined-benefit pension plans against losing their pension if their employer is in financial distress or fails to fully pre-fund its pension obligations. Nearly 44 million American workers in more than 29,000 private-sector pension plans are protected by P.B.G.C. Some 1.3 million workers are covered by pension plans that have been taken over by the agency. Tax dollars do not finance P.B.G.C. ; instead, the corporation collects insurance premiums from companies and assumes the assets of failed pension plans - -- which it invests -- to finance its obligations. <p> There is a widely shared presumption that the federal government would bail out P.B.G.C. if it became unable to meet its obligations for retirees. And the chance that P.B.G.C. will someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of September 2008, it reported assets of $63 billion and liabilities of $74 billion, for a shortfall of $11 billion. <p> In the old days -- that is, before March 2008 -- an $11 billion deficit would attract attention. P.B.G.C. 's deficit is small compared with that of A.I.G. or Citigroup, private sector companies that have garnered government bailouts, but there are reasons to be concerned that taxpayers will eventually be on the hook for a substantial bailout. <p> First, although P.B.G.C. reported that its unfunded liability fell from $14 billion to $11 billion last year, this forecast is not as rosy as it seems. The estimated present value of future liabilities dropped only because the agency used a much higher interest rate to discount future payouts. It discounts future payouts using an interest rate linked to corporate bond yields, which jumped in the credit crisis. To economists, it would make more sense to use a slow-moving riskless long-term interest rate to discount future payouts. <p> Second, the current recession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private pensions that fall in P.B.G.C. 's lap. <p> Third, earlier this year the agency 's board( the secretaries of labor, commerce and the Treasury) adopted a new investment strategy that took on more risk. Instead of investing around a quarter of its assets in equities and most of the rest in bonds, as it had been doing, the corporation 's board decided to allot 45 percent of the portfolio to public equities( both American and international stocks), 45 percent to fixed-income securities( a mix of corporate bonds and government bonds), and 10 percent to alternative investments( real estate and private equities). <p> The decision to move a large share of the portfolio out of safe assets like Treasury bonds and into riskier but possibly higher-paying assets like stocks has been controversial. <p> The decision would have proved catastrophic had it been immediately acted upon because the stock market has fallen so far. Fortunately, P.B.G.C. has been slow to act on its new policy. By my back-of-the-envelope calculation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of last year, it would have lost around 12.2 percent of its assets by September 2008. Instead, it lost " only " 6.5 percent, or $4.2 billion. * <p> But the new portfolio allocation is controversial for another, more fundamental reason. <p> It may make sense for universities and philanthropies to pursue an aggressive, diversified portfolio strategy that is heavily weighted toward equities and alternative investments. But it is not clear that such a strategy is optimal for an insurer like P.B.G.C. because its liabilities are also linked to market fluctuations. A philanthropy 's obligations are unrelated to stock market movements. By contrast, when the stock market falls P.B.G.C. gets hit by a double whammy : the value of its assets falls and its liabilities rise, because private pension plans face greater shortfalls when the stock market falls and the financial viability of companies themselves is threatened. <p> For this reason, economists favor taking into account liability risk together with asset risk in designing an investment policy for an insurance company. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it, " A company that insures against hurricane damage should not invest its reserves in beachfront properties. " <p> The P.B.G.C. director Charles Millard has dismissed such criticisms as " pithy " comments. His defense is : 1) P.B.G.C. is seeking to increase returns by investing in a broad portfolio that is more tilted to equities and alternatives in the hopes of staving off a government bailout ; and 2) the agency 's experience has been that most of its liabilities are due to financial stress in a small number of industries -- mainly airlines and steel -- and not general economic conditions. <p> The first defense sounds a bit like a gambler doubling down when he is losing. And although the second claim may have been the case in the past - -- which is questionable, because in the period I looked at, annual payouts went up when stock-market returns went down( and vice versa) -- there is no guarantee that it will continue. <p> The University of Illinois economist Jeffrey Brown, who rang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter, predicted that " P.B.G.C. would surely see its new liabilities rise at times of economic distress " because bankruptcies are more common in recessions. Additionally, the manufacturing sector, where defined benefit pensions are still common, is highly cyclically sensitive. <p> In contrast to P.B.G.C., many private sector defined-benefit pension insurers try to match their future obligations with their future investment income by buying safe fixed-income securities, such as Treasury bonds. This seems like a situation where the government could learn a lesson from the private sector. <p> Another area where the agency would do well to copy private sector insurers has to do with the insurance premium it charges companies. <p> At present, P.B.G.C. is not authorized by Congress to tailor the premiums employers pay to the riskiness or soundness of their pension. If a pension plan is invested in risky assets, for example, the corporation charges the same as it does for a plan that prudently invests in safe assets. The former is much more likely to end up costing it money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk-based premiums. <p> The existence of risk-based premiums would discourage employers from taking chances with their employees ' pension funds. Charging a higher rate to riskier pension plan sponsors could also help mitigate the agency 's long-standing projected deficit. <p> When the new board of P.B.G.C. is constituted under the Obama administration, it would do well to revisit the wisdom of investing less of the corporation 's portfolio in Treasury bonds and more in equities, and to encourage Congress to authorize it to risk-adjust premiums. <p> *** <p> *A note on these numbers : This calculation assumes a mix of 20 percent United States equities, 25 percent international equities, 45 percent fixed income, 5 percent real estate and 5 percent private equities. Returns were assumed to be -22 percent for United States equities and private equities( matching the S. &P.; 500), -30.3 percent for international equities, 1.6 percent for fixed income( matching P.B.G.C. actual performance), and 4 percent for real estate. <h> 14 Comments <p> The PBGC and most pension plans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The true objective is to fund the " liabilities " at the lowest cost to the plan with prudent risk. Unfortunately, liabilities are either missing in action or incorrectly valued. Valuing liabilities at a high intertest rate distorts economic reality. Liabilities need to be valued at riskless rates that you can buy to settle the liabilities. Lotteries are the best example of how to price liabilities and manage assets. Unfortunately, due to a disregard to the true objective assets have been managed vs. assets. If you outperform the S &P; 500 but lose to liabilities... you lose! Until a CUSTOM LIABILITY INDEX is installed as the objective benchmark( which values liabilities at the market daily) the asset side is in jeopardy of managing to the wrong objective. <p> To suggest that the taxpayers will not be on the hook for these pensions is quite nieve. The steel industry pensions is an example from the past. Another bail-out? It 's America 's answer. The Fed continues to believe that it can borrow it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next administration, but this theory has it 's limits, as we 're about to find out. <p> All those deficits by institutions from PBGC to Fannie can not be easily patched up by simply a bailout. At this point with 0% interest rate, more Fed bailouts could only mean printing more money, which means an automatic tax on every person holding US dollar. In effect, that 's spreading the pain of deficit to every one, so everyone feels " negligible " pain than a big collapse of an important entity. <p> The GM-Chrysler bailout using taxpayer money would also mean a spreading of pain to all those who are working -- the more you work, the more you are taxed and made to pay for GM-Chrysler bailout( amounting to $87.58 per working person). With clear knowledge that Chrysler has been bailed out before and the same argument of a single failure affecting suppliers causing chain failure to all, the availability of future bailouts is always a nice pillow of insurance for them. Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The addiction to bailout needs to stop. Aggregating all the deficits and losses into national debt and dissipating them into a sea of green bills create a potentially self-imploding bubble so large and evasive that it might be the next " super-prime " problem. <p> More fundamental rebuilding and hard work would need to take place to replenish lost capital. <p> Here is an example of some terrible waste that tends to be standard : I went to my regular dr 's office last spring and saw a nurse practitioner as usual, however, I was experiencing a problem for which they sent me to the Hospital next door to have an ultrasound test done. The next day, my dr 's office called and advised that they would need to refer me to a specialist due to the results of the Ultrasound. They set up an appointment for the next day with an Gyn dr located in their same building. At this appointment, the first thint the Gyn was going to do was another ultrasound. I immediately objected. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with ins only covering %80, that leaves me with a $600.00 bill I did not want to double. I asked the Dr if he could n't just look at the results from the previous day and he claimed that those results belong to the hospital and he could only get a report on them but that the computers in his office were only for scheduling patients and he could n't tie them up trying to get the other results from the hospital. Not to mention that his bedside manner was crap. He said that he would see what he could do. He left the room. His nurse immediately came in and said that she needed to move me to a different room. I followed her to a different room which did not have any equipment in it and was rather dirty by comparison. I decided then and there that no matter how qualified this guy was, I was n't going to let him do anything to me. I paid for his office visit and went home and called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comfortable with this guy and I wanted a different referal. I 've never had any problem with my reg dr but they did n't want to refer me anywhere else but did. The next Dr was much more experienced and offered explanations, did n't try to get another ultrasound and gave me all of the options. Of course being a woman in my late 40? s all of their initial reaction was to just do a hysterectomy. However, I insisted that if my parts were n't diseased and if there were any other options, I wanted the least invasive, least down time possible and to keep whatever parts that were n't absolutely necessary to remove. He was okay with that. I doubt the first guy would 've been. I truely believe that alot of the reason for rising health care costs is just dr 's jacking up the cost so they can collect from insurance even if it is not necessary. <p> The flood gates are now truly open. The next one in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in a worse shape than residential in 2009 due to the hits to the economy. The state and local governments will also need to be bailed out due to the drop in economic activity. Everyone with a pulse will be queing up for a bailout and most will be more worthy than the Wall Street Fat Cats who just got $350 billion from the treasury and countless other billions from the FED. <p> We have to look at " the big picture. " Our days of tunnel vision need to cease. Our nation better wake up and smell the coffee. With all our bail outs along with the 168 billion economic stimulus package, that btw did nothing for our economy it is hard to understand why our government ca n't see the need to bail us out of our dependence on foreign oil. The high cost of fuel this past year seriously damaged our economy and society. Meanwhile, while we are busy doing the Happy Dance around the lower prices at the pumps, OPEC is planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per barrel. Why do n't we invest in America 's Energy Independence. It would cost the equivalent of 60 cents per gallon to charge and drive. The electricity used to charge the car could conceivably be generated by solar or wind. Why not invest some of these millions in getting some of these projects set up? Create clean cheap energy, badly needed new green collar jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. What more of a win-win situation could there be? Now there is talk of another stimulus pkg. Do n't get me wrong, if you hand me a check I will take it. I am broke from this past year myself. I just think we are going about this all wrong. I just read a fascinating book by Jeff Wilson called The Manhattan Project of 2009 Energy Independence NOW. We need to look at the " big picture " This book Is the big picture. http : **35;1010;TOOLONG Wilson also has a fascinating article on the Better Place Web Page called How Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it @ http : **35;1047;TOOLONG... <p> Quite a few years ago, while perusing the offerings in an antique shop, the dealer 's collection of old bank notes caught my eye... a German Reichsbanknote for " Swanzig Millionen Mark " dated Berlin July 25, 1923. If I recall correctly, it could be had for oh, about $1.00. <p> I began to do some mental calculations concerning this princely sum denominated on this now worthless piece of currency, and noted that when my grandmother, who left Austria in 1913 after visiting her family, to return to her new home in America, this twenty million Reichmarks was truly a ' Princely " sum. In her 1913 world, that amount of cash would have put you at the top of European Society, and access to the best of everything to be had. <p> But... that was 1913. <p> Just ten years later, when the Reichsbanknote we are discussing was printed, one would have been hardpressed to buy a loaf of bread with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loads of banknotes? <p> What happened? <p> Germany, in order to pay reparations for its war DEBTS, was sending its gold, and material goods to France. For internal banking, paper ' currency ' was exploited to cover the drain of real value to the money supply. Hyperinflation set in, and that twenty million mark fortune, if not held in GOLD, lost ALL VALUE in just ten years! <p> Curiously, just next door in Austria, there was no inflation problem. Why? The Austrian government adheared to Prof. Ludwig Von Mises sound money policies, that is, ' gold backed '. <p> The Austrians, it appears, were right. <p> For the Germans, well, as the economy collapsed, the way was prepared for an ' answer man ', and they voted for one... <p> What about us? Since going off the gold standard, are things better? <p> I can remember, that as a child in 1964, going to the corner store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me. With it, I bought the bread, and had change left to bring back, she would count it, and check that I got a fresh loaf, something of a challenge for a nine year old boy. She got the change, and sometimes even fresh bread. <p> What does that loaf of bread cost today? Ten times that 1964 silver quarter! <p> A Princeton President of long ago, taught on these issues, and recent events have proved him right. Samuel Stanhope Smith, circa 1812 stated in his lectures : <p> " The institution of banks, when properly restricted, is beneficial to trade, by facilitating a reasonable credit to merchants, by which they are enabled to encourage industry, and to extend the useful enterprizes of commerce. <p> On the other hand, the multiplication of banks beyond the real necessities of trade, or unsupported by an adequate capital of bullion, becomes a pernicious evil, by augmenting unduly an artificial medium of trade, and thereby increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market, and at length defrauding the credit which had been reposed in them. " <p> " This medium, gold, silver in order to subserve the various purposes of trade, and to render it, at all times, a safe and convenient mean of exchange ought to possess the following properties. It ought, in the first place, to have an intrinsic value, and to be in itself an object of desire, and, therefore, a proper subject of commerce, as well as a sign of wealth, and a standard of the value of all other things. " <p> Perhaps we are about to see who, indeed is right... Drs. Smith and Mises, or the Keynesian school promising to
