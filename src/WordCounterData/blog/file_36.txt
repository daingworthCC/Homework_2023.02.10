5111641 <h> Weird Al 's Influence on Me Over the Years <p> Me as a tween <p> When I was a child there was n't any music I really connected to, until I heard Weird Al for the first time. I saw him in the Dare to be stupid video on MTV. He instantly became my idol. He was n't a pop star. He did n't have rock star good looks. He was n't even singing about the normal love/break-up songs. He was making fun of MaDonna, a huge icon of the 1980s. This was amazing to me. You could be famous and funny for making fun of other people. My mind was blown. <p> English : " Weird Al " Yankovic performing live in concert during his 2010 Tour. <p> His Hawaiian shirts became the symbol I looked for. I craved anything Weird Al. I wanted to hear more music and see more videos. When they gave him his own show my ears almost vomited brain cheese. Unfortunately I grew up poor and did n't own my first Weird Al album unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own!). One of my goals in life became to own every Weird Al album ever made. I did n't realize he 'd be putting them out for the next... forever.Thankfully my cousins got some of his albums over the years and I was able to listen to him that way. <p> When Weird Al came out with the song " Oh Ricky! " my cousin, Jessa, and I used to come up with dance routines to it. I was taller and had a deeper voice, so I got to sing Ricky 's part. I remember practicing in her bedroom so we could put on a show for our parents. They thought we were crazy, but we were happy so it was ok. As I grew I added more albums and paraphernalia to my Weird Al collection. I have UHF on DVD and like to watch it with my BFF. ; D The last album I bought was Straight Back to Lynwood. I used to own almost his entire album collection at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine felt the need to trash my stuff with no plans to replace it. *pouty face* <p> I 'm heartbroken not having Weird Al to listen to whenever I want. I have a newborn son that I want to introduce to the music that made me happy. <p> There is a once-in-a-lifetime chance that I *might* be able to go to see him in concert, something I 've waited my entire life for. Weird Al is coming to Rutland and playing at the famed Paramount Theatre in Rutland, VT in October. The theatre is, literally, 2 blocks from my house. If I can go see my idol in concert, it would make up for the years I 've gone without his music in my collection. So, I 'm hopeful. I really, really, REALLY want to go. <p> Even if I do n't get a chance to see my idol in my hometown, I 'll still be a fan. I 'll find a way to introduce my son to his music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weird Al 's Influence on Me Over the Years <p> Even if you cant get into the show, being so close you could walk down after the show since he does meet and greets at many of his shows. Not all of them, but he does them more often than not. Or even during the day, Ive seen Al coming out
