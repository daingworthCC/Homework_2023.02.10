5146241 <h> Direct Confirmation From Heaven That We Are In The End Times <p> I am still in touch with England 's wonderful Psychic Terry Strange, a well-respected spiritualist medium and he has issued a grave warning privately to me ' Ronnie, you need to warn the people mate, my spirit guide Garry has reported a visitation in heaven of a huge new reception area being built there, the angels are working on it night and day, looks like they 're expecting lots and lots of new arrivals very soon mate. The Other Side Of Life is about to become crowded, they 've set tents up to cope from the look of it. Could be your rapture might happen after all mate, I know you 're a good man of God so I want you to be aware, OK brother, blessings Psychic Terry Strange ' <p> Psychic Terry Strange 's **29;7254;TOOLONG powers are given to him as a gift by God as revealed and I desperatley want to share this with you. These are the last days. Soon many people may disappear and then the Tribulation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe in seven days, im sure he could expand the other side in a blink of an eye, or has he lost his powers? Your mate has been talking to the wrong god. <p> Well I am not surprised at all that you athiest liberal skeptics reply to me with your snide comments. Psychic Terry Strange has revealed many amazing revelations to me through the loving powers of his spirit guide Garry. I was unsure myself initially about Psychic Terry Strange as I am not a gullible person and do not believe in fairytales such as evolution, God tells us very clearly in His inspired Word, the Bible, that He created the heavens and the earth, as well as man. God also told us that the chosen( myself and family included) will go UP in the Rapture. God has also told Psychic Terry Strange that the powers he has are given to him by the Creator( through his spirit guide Garry) and everything that Psychic Terry Strange has told me about my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have noreason to doubt that if Garry says angels are preparing the Celestial City for a huge intake of souls this is truth.
