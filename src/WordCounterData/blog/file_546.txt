5163041 <p> From the Beatles and the British invasion to Janis Joplin and psychedelia, the ' 60s came back in a rad way. One of the most eclectic decades to date took over Jesse Auditorium for one night one Saturday, Nov 3. when This is the ' 60s came to town. The living documentary combined the history of the time, the standout singles and performers with a range of talent to create an in-depth experience for the audience. <p> Father and son production duo, Jim and Greg Duffy were trying to bring the nostalgia back and play on the resurgence of interest of the decade. Their extensive knowledge of all things groovy helped not only entertain, but also invite audience members to relive the past. <p> The show had a lot to offer attendees but here are some things you may not know about This is the ' 60s. <p> 1) Jim originally intended the show to be a documentary and even pitched the idea to the History Channel. He began his research of the decade and ultimately decided a live show would provide a more dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film elements he had researched and threw in the live music. <p> 2) The same seven performers are in all five segments of the show. They had to learn to play music and dance in a way that reflected the diverse parts of the decade. Each of the time periods had distinct music, dances, costumes and multimedia. The band and dancers had to adjust and make each character they played seem realistic and different from the last. " We made that clear up front, that they 're going to need to do everything from soft folk music to screaming acid rock music, and they were totally into it, " Jim says. " Good musicians like a challenge and this was definitely a challenge for them. " <p> 3) A lot of time went into finding the most realistic costumes for the show. Even Jim 's wife pitched in by making some of the costumes herself. Between rummaging thrift stores and scouring the Carolinas, Jim was searching for the perfect ensembles for each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim 's wife pulled looks together on her own, truly making the production a family affair. <p> 4) In order to keep the music and visuals in sync while the band played live, the drummer would listen to clicks in an earpiece keeping everyone and everything running at the same pace. This system was used to help manage the show, without it, the visuals and multimedia would have been completely out of sync. <p> 5) The actual Joshua Light Show that was performed in the Fillmore is used in the show, oil drops and all. The video clip was used to help bring a more authentic feel -- multimedia played a big role in making this type of production so unique. And Greg Duffy is the one to thank. He not only created the multimedia aspect of the show, but also found ways to make every part do the ' 60s justice. Although some would doubt a 27-year-olds understanding of a decade he did n't live through it is safe to say Greg knows more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bummed you missed it, do n't fret. This is the ' 70s, ' 80s and ' 90s are all in the
