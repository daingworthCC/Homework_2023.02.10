ROBIN SKOUTERIS!!! <p> This could seriously support the argument that " all pop music sounds alike( and get off my lawn) ". To their credit, the Psy and Gotye snippets were among the few that did n't fit perfectly seamlessly. posted by oneswellfoop at 2:34 PM on November 17 <p> I 've made a couple of posts about DJ Earworm and do like his stuff a lot( especially this fantastic track : If I Were A Free-Fallin ' Boy,) but his last couple of United States of Pop remixes were a bit too heavily autotuned for my taste. One of the things I like about these is the autotuning is harder to detect. posted by zarq at 2:53 PM on November 17 <p> I really do n't get this mashup thing. In theory it 's cool. In practice it is nearly always underwhelming. I like it when disparate genres are thrown together, and it does n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pure novelty, and maybe I 'm grumpy, but novelty bugs me. But this never fails to amuse me. Low hanging fruit? Sure. Oddly compelling and bizarrely fitting? Most definitely. If there 's something really inventive coming out of the mashup culture, please direct me because the execution almost always disappoints me.
