At any time of any year, now or in the future, owners of this album would have the perfect soundtrack to accompany their life. <p> WINTER The first season " Winter " begins with the icy cool tones of an appropriately titled track -- " La Aurora " before seamlessly blending into John 00 Fleming 's " The Astrophysical Neblua " and then Yahel 's amazing remix of Paul 's own single with Robert Vadney " Pop Star ". This is a beautiful, yet melancholic 80 minute journey that reflects " Winter " perfectly. Other highlight tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the absolutely huge Solarstone remix of his own vocal track with Alex Karweit " Breakaway "( which has been a huge anthem of the Four Seasons tour), the brand new Orkidea remix of Paul van Dyk &; Tilt 's Perfecto Records classic " Rendezvous " and the breath taking Thomas Datt remix of Paul 's 2011 single " Full Moon Party ". <p> SPRING " Spring " begins with a dark and industrial vibe -- emphasizing the end of " Winter ". The Prayag &; Rishab remix of " All Good Things " almost immediately gives way to the driving Perfecto Fluoro monster " Collective Insantity " from Reaky &; Skaivox and the twisted vocal hit from Federation, " Black Tide ". But in the same way that this season evolves from dark to light Thomas Datt 's " It 's in The Past " begins the blossoming process -- adding colour and uplifting melody. The journey continues with beautiful melodic pieces from Stereo Wildlife ft. Kid Alaska, Nash &; Pepper and of course Paul Oakenfold 's huge hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding Eshericks remix of Future Funk Squad and Beatman &; Ludmilla 's vocal anthem " About to Fall ". And with that the transition from dark to light is complete. <p> SUMMER The most mellow of the Four Seasons, " Summer ", slows things down considerably kicking off with the blissfully ambient " From the Earth " -- a perfect opener from Anjunabeats genius Andrew Bayer. Smooth and uplifting with cascading, hypnotic melodies " Summer " is the " round the pool " or " en route to a festival " soundtrack that we 've been looking for. One of Paul 's current favourites, Future Disciple, features on the mix no less than three times and when you hear his remix of Walsh &; McAuley 's sublime vocal number " Sail on The Waves " -- you see why. Other highlights include Swab &; Joey Mova 's hit record " Lux in Tenebris " featuring the vocals of Tyler Sherritt, Flesh &; Bone 's remix of Poncho ft. Paul Oakenfold &; Maxxi Trusso 's " Please Me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Amanda Wilson 's " Dancin Dancin ". The mix ends with a track Paul recently described as his " perfect summer record " -- a sultry number from 16 Bit Lolitas and Lucy Iris called " Na Na Nahana ". <p> AUTUMN For the final chapter Paul Oakenfold picks up the pace and gallops through a powerful 80 minute hit list of Full On Fluoro monsters. This is driving, tough, goa inspired trance of the kind Paul Oakenfold has pioneered since its inception. Beginning with Yahel &; Liya 's forthcoming vocal anthem " Creatures " the mix thunders through 18 driving, acid infused tracks including 2nd Phase " Dragon Bomb ", Corderoy " Mechanical Tears " and the massive Eshericks dubstep breaks remix of Brian Cameron 's " Serotonin Syndrome ". Discover Records ' hero Gary Maguire gives two stunning productions for the mix -- firstly a new single with Stereo Wildlife, " Always Different " and then a killer new remix of the Perfecto Records classic " Bullet in The Gun ". Closing the album and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together ", his incredibly hot remix of " Creatures " and the brand new remix of " Throwing Stones " from one of Perfecto 's hottest breaks producers Eshericks. <p> " I wanted to make an album with four distinctly different mixes that each reflected the mood and vibe of the season they represented and so the Four Seasons concept was born. I wanted to create the perfect soundtrack to compliment whatever backdrop your life was set against. Putting these mixes together has been an epic experience. I hope you will have a similar experience from listening
