5127041 <h>... and the other <p> Yeah, I know... another Wednesday comes and goes without a post from me. Like you care... really. LOL! Anyway, most of today 's post is a slugfest. No, not in the " beat you up " kinda way but various things in short bursts sort of way. <p> * Went to the hearing at City Hall last night. It was a Planning Commission hearing on the fate of the business that runs out of the historical " Russ Clements gas station ". I was impressed by the turn out. A conclusion was n't reached and the hearing will continue on Dec. 2. <p> * Looking around the City Hall chamber last night I think they could save some money( including our taxes) by switching out the light bulbs that presently illuminate the place. There are also stage lights overhead( Par cans) that can be swapped out with less power sucking led types. <p> * It was overcast and cold yesterday... just made me want to curl up and nap. I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to... just sayin. <p> * I have n't repeated a meal in close to 7 weeks. I 'm shooting for 8. It 's a personal challenge and I 'm delightfully impressed with myself.( That does n't happen very often. <p> * I may go through a bunch of photographs and scan more pictures from the past. It 's been fun doing the few I have some of late. Yeah, I 've threatened to revive " Picture Daze " on several occasions... but I may actually follow through with it this time.( Do n't hold your breath though... LOL) <h> 3 Responses to... and the other <p> One thing I did this week was surf over to the Jungle Webs site and re-read that last B.I.T.S. post... the one about marketing your Rogue play. As our latest CD is starting to congeal( coagulate?), it 's time for a plan, and your post reminded and inspired. I 've already begun plans and a bit of shooting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, just the planning out what to say is bringing focus to the questions : " what is this for? ' ' who 's gon na benefit from hearing it ' -- really basic questions like that. Thanks for your good work -- and yeah, I 'm sort of rambling away, but today 's post was sort of shooting in a thousand
