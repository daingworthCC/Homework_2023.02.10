5181241 <h> Also See <p> In its second year, National Plug-In Day this past Sunday certainly avoided sophomore slump. <p> In 65 cities all over the U.S., tens of thousands of electric-car owners, potential buyers, and just curious onlookers pored over, rode in, and drove plug-in vehicles from more than a dozen makers. <p> Our favorite factoid : In Nashville, Tennessee, about 70 cars--almost all of them Leaf electric cars from nearby employer Nissan--were encouraged to honk every time they passed a gas station. No fewer than 10 different gas stations were passed by a parade of honking Leafs during the drive event. <p> Here 's a brief rundown of just a few of the other major events across the country. <p> NEW YORK CITY <p> In Times Square, more than 5,000 people ogled Tesla and Fisker plug-in luxury cars, Nissan Leafs, several different businesses ' electric delivery trucks, and a Chevrolet Volt in the livery of the New York City Parks Department. <p> " We had a terrific turn out from both domestic and international crowds, " said Julie Migliacci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communities. <p> " Most of them had never seen an electric vehicle before. " <p> LOS ANGELES <p> Not only did 500 people visit the Plug-In Day event in Los Angeles, but organizers logged more than 300 test drives in just four hours. <p> As part of the ceremonies, she awarded Congressional Recognition certificates to the event organizers--Plug In America, the Sierra Club, and the Electric Auto Association--and other plug-in proponent organizations. <p> SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA <p> More than 4,000 people left contact information or collected literature on plug-in vehicles. Those displaying the most interest received free-drink cards for the Food Court at the outlet mall where Plug-In Day held its event. <p> Attendees were encouraged to visit all the different electric-car exhibits by getting stamps on their " passports, " which entered them in a drawing for a free weekend rental at Enterprise. <p> " We probably had 10 conversations an hour of extended duration that educated the uninformed, " said George Parrott, Green Car Reports author and emeritus professor at California State University-Sacramento. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plug-In Day event in Washington, D.C. San Antonio, Texas, logged 600 visitors, and Maui saw 500 over two days of events. <p> Denver also registered about 500 interested attendees ; Annapolis, Maryland, logged 400... and that still leaves more than 50 cities. <p> John, There were a lot more than 60 Leafs at the Crissy Field Plug in Day, More like 80 to 100. I 'm the old guy with dark hair and a white beard, standing behind the guy on the left with the yellow hoodie in the picture. There are a couple of rows of Leafs to the left of the picture, not shown, plus more near the tent to the right, not shown. <p> I went to an event in Orlando, FL. There were leafs( leaves?) Volts, Prius electric convert, a custom electric made by a local college, a Zero motorcycle, MIEV, a strange little custom job, and two Focus electrics. No Teslas or Fiskers thou. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Audi, solid and planted. We have owned BMW, Acura, Lexus, Infiniti and VW Passats, so we are familiar with " good handling. " The Volt qualifies easily there. <p> Our Sacramento site provided ride and drive experiences to introduce the Leaf, Toyota Prius plug-in, Volt, Ford Focus EV, and Coda on a 5+ mile tour including city streets and freeway sampling! We had display cars for the Mitsubishi i, Tesla Model S and Fisker Karma, so attendees got exposure to pretty much the FULL RANGE of everything one might buy today. <p> I was at the DC Plug in Event. Ford sponsored and had a Fusion Electric available for test drives. While 750 People may have signed in, many more got exposed, to this because the event was on 3rd street near the museums so many people walked by and visited with a few of the car display managers even though they did n't sign in. I saw the Ford Fusion, Chevy Volt, Tesla Model S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very week), Tesla Roadster, Think Electric sedan, Nissan Leaf, Fiskar Karma, Plug in Prius, There were some conversion vehicles like a souped up Prius, a Plug in Porsche conversion, an electric Trike, a Zero E-Bike, and I " m sure i 'm forgetting a few others. It was a great event. <p> National Plug in Day is an excellent idea. EV 's need all the publicity they can get. I reside in Central NY State/North Eastern US ; California/Arizona &; Florida get most of the EV attention. EV 's will finally get established when companies like Tesla decide to set up shop in the Northeast. Great proving ground for cold weather &; hilly driving. <p> Good event at the Maryland park-and-ride. Not as big as those in California, but there was a nice turnout at the MTA site where they installed 5 Chargepoint stations. Karma test drives, Ford C-Max Hybrid test drives and a number of Think! city cars there. Next year, most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the EV ownership. The " movement " is definitely going
