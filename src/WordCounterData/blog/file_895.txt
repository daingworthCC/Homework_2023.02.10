5198441 <h> Tips To Keep The Sims 3 Interesting <p> I have been playing The Sims 3 since day one. I 'm not going to lie, it gets a bit boring at times. I find myself doing the same things over and over, like creating the same sims, choosing the same traits, and having them live the same life. All of these things can take the fun out of the game. So while you 're waiting on a new expansion pack to bring some excitement back into the game, here are a few tips and tricks that can help spice things up a bit. <p> 1. Randomize your traits. <p> Traits have a lot to do with how interesting a sim is. The traits you have can make a sim 's life easier or in some cases, harder. Most traits have unique interactions that can switch things up a bit. For example, you could try to make a living from hacking with the Computer Whiz trait, or only furnish your home with items that you steal from their neighbors with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you like more than others, or that help you accomplish your Lifetime Wish the easier, click randomize! <p> 2. Buy that expansion pack that you think you wo n't like. <p> I will be the first to say that I 'm usually skeptical about an expansion pack, and find a hard time paying for something that I feel is n't my thing. You have to keep in mind a saying that has been around for a very long time, " Do n't knock it ' til you try it ". Sure, a certain expansion pack might not seem all that useful based on the way that you play your game, but keep in mind that expansion packs comes with brand new interactions, furniture, clothes, and things to explore. Not everything that is in the expansion packs are shown in EA 's livestream. They always leave a bit for you to discover on your own, and that bit may be the thing that you use and/or adore the most. <p> 3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " FIVE DOLLARS FOR A FREAKING OBJECT?!? " I know, it sounds crazy but think of it this way, we spend five dollars for a meal at McDonald 's that only satisfies us for about two hours and keeps up on the toilet all night. We spend five dollars on a cheap new eyeshadow quad only to find the colors are n't pigmented and extremely chalky. We will even spend five dollars at Starbucks for a drink packed with nothing but calories. Why not spend it on something that you will use for a few months, possibly years? Face it, video games are expensive, and so is the additional content that users have to buy separately. This is for all games, not just The Sims 3. There is a gun for Team Fortress 2 that costs $10, and there is n't a day that goes by that I play and do not see a player using it. In my opinion, the premium content from The Sims 3 Store is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add something new, something fresh, and can even make the most boring simmer perk up a bit. If you can afford it, I highly recommend the splurge. <p> 4. Stop Cheating! <p> Cheats can pretty much dull down the excitement for a lot of people and they do n't even realize it. Once you start with nothing and work your way to the top, you can possibly feel a sense of accomplishment. Working for the best furniture and cars is something that I love to do in my gameplay. Why do it the easy way, when you can do it the hard way? Lol. <p> 5. Create an exciting and new storyline for your sims and stick to it. <p> Everyone loves a good story, and most importantly, they love creating a good story. Create a storyline for your sim, most likely something that you could never imagine doing in real life and go with it. For example, I can be a very conservative and reserved girl. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bedroom " with every sim he could find, it was something new that I had never done in the game, and walking around town, having random girls run and slap me was hilarious and just all around a fun time. I played that household for a really long time, and only stopped when I fell into my habit of having a conservative household with loving parents and obedient children. Try stepping outside of the box in your gameplay. Do things that you 've never really done before. <p> 6. Try out a challenge. <p> Last, but certainly not least, I recommend switching up your gameplay completely by trying out some of the many challenges created by simmers from around the world. Many of these challenges may seem outrageous and time consuming, but once you get started, you will certainly be in new territory with your gameplay. Some of these challenges take the game to a new level, and are not as easy as they appear to be. Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I recommend trying out the zombie apocalypse challenge, it looks pretty awesome. <p> I get all my store towns for free. Gold versions as well I know it 's cheap but I 'd rather spend my money on a day out to London or Thorpe Park than a town of which I can not myself actually live in. On the day the town is released go onto youtube and type in " The sims 3 *town name* free download " and Wala! It 's reliable and free. Hope this helps! <p> I 'm not even gonan lie, I was just thinking of this when I was playing Sims 3 yesterday. I was like " Well this is boring " and was trying to think of fun ways to spice it up. Thanks for doing it for me! It 's like we share a special telepathic bond... <p> Thanks for this quxxn, i have been having this trouble lately a lot im getting bred of it and there are so many thing 's you said in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating i know it would be better if i did n't but i want to get to a place in my story then i have done it all. Im going to try this, the main reason is with seasons coming out im so excited to play this i do n't want to play the sims 3 until then like when sims 3 was announced i stopped playing sims 2 straight away. Thanks for all the tips xx <p> Actually Quxxn influenced me to not use cheats. the only cheat i use is MoveObjects On because sometimes things do nt fit where i want them. but i never use Motherlode or Kaching( i forgot) because I now think its more fun to do all this stuff by earning it. you got ta be patient though. but when i used motherlode i realized how boring my game got. i was just using motherlode over and over again. and then my sims would have like 700,000 dollars. so i had nothing to try and get : my sims never had jobs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. i just wan na say to those cheat users that you should stop because i noticed how much fun i had then, and how much more i have now <p> Hey Quxxn I was thinking could you maybe put a house on the exchange for me. Not to be rube or anything but it would mean the world to me if you did. Now the house i want you to do is not the ending lets play the sims 3 pets house but the one befor it thank very much if you can do it. If not Im sorry for making wast your time. <p> Hey queen im just leting u know that i love ur tops i think it will vary much help with my game play! after seeing some of ur videos on yt i did nt even know u could do some Of the stuff uv dine lol have a great day queen <p> yay i want to play the sims now. another way to make your game more interesting is to make the most of the expansion packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, try and complete all the careers in ambitions( not all in one go though), get level 3 visa in all 3 travel destinations etc. <p> I 'm having a " very adventurous in the bedroom " household right now and it 's so much fun! I am flirting with any girl in town and today this sim-Ryan Morgan have 20 kids from diffrent mothers twins and triples too,, hahhahaha LOVE YOU AND YOUR LPS! Ca n't wait for your The Sims 3 Supernatural LPS all the way from Israel <p> I seriously agree with you especially when you talked about cheats.I liked to use them but i stopped doing that when i read that article because i want to feel i actually accomplished something when playing the sims 3 thanks Quxxn! <p> I have a problem with 2, 3, and... okay, I admit to 4... On 2, I do n't want Late Night, I think it 's retarded. It seems kind of disgusting, much to the disapprovement and critique of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no SPs, but I do want Katy Perry 's Sweet Treats... My friend is trying to mooch WA and A off of me, and all she has is G, LN, and P... 3. Trust me, All I ever want is the Magic stuff and the infamous cowplant. I have the VooDoo Doll and Magic Book right now, but I do n't want to torrent. BUT SERIOUSLY, I am not going to pay 6.00$ with my money. We should get it all free in my opinion. Just with the EPs and base game, so far they are getting 280$! and by next yr., it 'll be 360. Rip Off Artists! 4. Thats really hard to do because I will always build a house to go with it. AND IT ALWAYS ENDS UP EXPENSIVE! Please make an article about that! Ane, cheats are needed for building. <p> you have great tips and i love your videos. i also just recently just recently started playing with out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be funner with out cheats. this also got me to change my house around with the customizing tool. my current house if really funky looking but i like and i put the colors the people in my sims household like. <p> Thank you thank you thank you. Because of you I had the best sims experience I have had in a while. I did the Homeless Drifter Challenge. My sim had RANDOM traits( something that I NEVER do.) You should do an LP playing a homeless sim. I think it would show people how you can have a fulfilling experience without all the " stuff. " Do n't get me wrong you need stuff, but you just do n't have to buy it. Sadly Joanna Frome reached the top of her career at 83, so by the time she could financially have a child, she was barren and single. Though the whole town knew( and loved) the homeless woman who used their porch rocking chairs, and grills. <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't have made an apartment complex without using them. They make things a lot more fun for me because I do n't have to spend the majority of my time trying to feed, bathe or send my sim to the bathroom, therefore, not getting any reading done or skills learned. So.......... I 'll just keep playing it my way. Also, I 'm not going to splurge my money on those crappy items, do n't encourage spending on something when people can make up their minds for themselves. <p> can u plz do generations or fast lane because u forced me to watch some other guy do generations and some other girl did an lp on fast lane and it was awsome. so if u want me to stick with u because u r good and all but i really want to see some fast lane and btw did u do katy perry sweet treats because i only saw a review that was 37 min. <p> thank you and please in your next seasons lp i will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
