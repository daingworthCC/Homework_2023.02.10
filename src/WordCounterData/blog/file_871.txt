It is necessary to survive in the modern world. We know it can not make us happy but not having money can create a lot of unhappy situations. Having gone through some pretty serious financial struggles, I definitely prefer having some cash in my pocket. We say we do not care if we have a lot of money and we have lots of negative feelings towards people that have a lot of it -- hence the great pleasure we get from seeing rich and famous celebrities falter in the public eye. Why? Because we are jealous of their wealth. <p> You probably developed an interest in law of attraction because there are things in life that you want and you do not have them ; you are sick of not having them and you want to find a way to get them. Most of the things people want to attract require money to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is the only thing that will take care of that. <p> But, it is not money you actually want, you want what it can bring you, whether it is the peace of mind that comes with having money to pay your bills or the exhilaration you believe you will experience from traveling the world. You could have rooms full of money but if you could not spend it, it would be useless. <p> So, you have probably set a lot of intentions to get more money and you just focus on money and numbers. This has its place for sure, but we have a lot of weird energy around money, which explains why so many of us struggle with obtaining it ; we want it but it has been drilled into our head that wanting to have it is wrong. Rich people are immoral and their wealth is based on taking something away from someone else. It is spiritual to be poor. The list could go on and on. When you are contending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you, at least not in the amounts you desire. <p> But, because it is not the money you actually want, you need to be shifting your focus elsewhere... towards the things that you want to buy with this money. It is easier to feel good and visualize about these things. When you start focusing on money exclusively, I bet you experience a lot of of unpleasant feelings and situations. You think about your past and present financial situation and can not see how it could ever change significantly. You start worrying about those overdue bills. You start trying to logically figure out the ways you could get this money to come to you, and since the logical mind limits our thinking so much, you probably start to get discouraged because you can not possibly see any path that will bring you to where you want to be. In the attracting game, all of this will not bode well for you. <p> When you set clear intentions regarding the things you want to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have set very powerful forces in motion -- forces that do not make any sense to our logical minds. Just focus on what you want and less focus on the money, especially if thinking about it starts bringing up bad feelings. You can not possibly anticipate all the different ways your income could increase or the different opportunities presented to you to make money. By feeling good about the things you want, you will get more money in some shape or form. <p> Another thing I would like to add is that in some instances, you may get the things you want without even needing money to get them -- you could win a contest, have someone buy your desired item for you, or experience some other situation where you get what you want without having to acquire the money yourself to get it. <p> You will surely have moments when this is a struggle, I get it because I have been there. But, the great thing is, as long as you are feeling good more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing progress. Remember to focus more on the things you want
