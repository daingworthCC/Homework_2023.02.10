5132041 <h> Monday, September 10, 2012 <h> Bigfoot Academic, Dr. Jeff Meldrum Interviewed by a Chicken <p> Not only is this one of the most interesting approaches to interviewing in Bigfoot history, but it is truly an informative interview. The Chicken of Truth is able to get best out of Dr. Jeff Meldrum. We got the heads up from Damian Bravo, member of Team Tazer Bigfoot, lthe video would be up this morning. Below is how the Chicken of Truth was able to snag the exclusive interview followed by the interview. <p> Yes you heard it right my hairless primate friends my grandpa Dr. Meldrum and I Cot the chicken had a nice early morning conversation about all kinds of stuff. The good doctor explains and talks about the DNA studies and other subjects. <p> Yes and exclusive from the greatest chicken bigfoot researcher in the Bigfoot world, well besides my human grandpa Dr. meldrum with all his science stuff, I had fun talking to him, COT HAS SPOKEN! BUAWWWWWK! <p> In fact, Chicken of Truth first appeared on the video channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 seconds introducing the Chicken of Truth( COT) ninja training program when he was a mere graduate. <h> 8 comments : <p> Dr. Meldrum was cool before, but now he is the man, what a show of humility and humbleness to do this interview, he sounds like he was having so much fun and its hilarious but at the same time very informative on the Doctors part in the Sykes DNA study and also his different opions on human are primates and the conerversation about baby bigfoot prints, very interesting stuff. Also great questions by the handsome Cot a chicken to recon with, wish much success Cot. <p> Good interviewer very professional. His name should be Cot Brokaw, or Cottie Chung. Dr.Meldrum makes a good point when he mentions further research will be needed if they do turn up unknown specie. The DNA wo n't be the end all proof that some think. It will be very important in establishing credibility to the cause which inturn may inspire big time funding to the scientist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Guy when he talked about just how close their DNA may be to ours because, yes, we too are apes. As far as baby Saquatch prints I think there are many reasons have been authenticated. Some believe that the Mothers carry the young like Gorilla mothers, some believe baby Saquatchs are tree dwellers, and some just overlooked like Dr.Meldrum says. I know if I was near a lake or river or even a hiking trail I would find a size 11 foot print that odd. <p> Anons at 4:47 and 5:10 you guys need to get a sense of humor, I can tell you two are those serious researchers that do not contribute anythng to the Bigfoot community. Yet Dr. Meldrum seems to have sense of humor, you can tell the character of a person by the way they are able to laugh at themselvs. here is a link of a interesting article about having a sense of humor and how good it is for your sanity, since both of you need some help in that department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor quickly. http : **35;278;TOOLONG... <h> Shared on Facebook <h> Subscribe To BfRLC <h> About Bigfoot Lunch Club <p> Bigfoot Lunch Club was launched in 2007 to provide the latest Bigfoot news, Bigfoot pictures, Bigfoot videos and overall pulse on Bigfoot in pop culture.
