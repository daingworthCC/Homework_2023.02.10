5159741 <h> Common App ' Endure ' Essay <p> This is an essay I typed in a college english class, and my mom is crazy about it even though I do n't really think it 's something useable for college apps. I guess I was just wondering if you think that this can be used for the common app or if it is just too much of a story. I would really appreciate comments or suggestions. <p> There are problems with society ; we are spoiled, babied from a young age to keep everything as comfortable as possible. I thought I had my problems, and that I knew what it meant to endure, what pain was. My life was easy, until one day I underwent a major surgery. I was born with an indented chest, otherwise known as Pectus Excavatum. My friends would joke about eating cereal out of the indent and laugh. I did n't think it was funny, to be honest, it hurt.

I do n't know what it means to be homeless or live in a household that pushes you in the wrong direction. I do n't know what it would be like to live without money, food or shelter. The greatest speaker I 've ever heard, Eric Thomas put it best ; " Pain is temporary.
