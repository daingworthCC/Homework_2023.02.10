5205641 <h> Support and defend the Constitution Against all Enemies, Foreign or Domestic... <h> 1 comment : <p> In July 2004 almost 200 Americans filed a landmark lawsuit against the U.S. Government seeking to have the federal Judiciary declare -- for the first time in history -- the constitutional meaning of the First Amendment Petition clause including the Right of the People to enforce the Right of Petition if Redress is denied. <p> We The People believes the Right to Petition is, in fact, the " capstone " Right of the Bill of Rights and that its effect is the direct exercise of Popular Sovereignty -- the First Principle of the Founding documents that declares government is the servant of Men In addition to the property tax case, the Judges of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals are coming to grips with these truths now that all the briefs have been filed in We The People v United States. <p> This, of course, is the landmark lawsuit brought against the federal government for its failure to respond to our Petitions for Redress of constitutional torts regarding the war powers, tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States of America. <p> In its April response brief to the Court of Appeals the government argues most strenuously for, and relies completely upon, a claim of " Sovereign Immunity " against We the People. In short, the government openly asserts that it possesses absolute immunity from its own People -- even for the commission of constitutional torts. The government argues that because Congress has not authorized this kind of lawsuit via federal legislation, that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <p> In our Reply Brief, the People refute these hollow and dangerous assertions and establish that in America, and under the Constitution of the United States of America, the concept of government immunity is, and by legal design, must be a myth. We argue that in a legal sense, sovereign immunity can not exist without practically " upending " our Constitution and depriving the People of their most fundamental Right -- i.e., the Right to dominion over their servant governments and that any assertion by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpation of power. <p> In sum, the Plaintiff 's Reply brief to the DC Circuit asks the appellate court to recognize that sovereign immunity is a myth, that no act of Congress can trump the Constitution, and that the higher order constitutional questions of the Rights of the People and the obligations of the government under the Petition Clause must be determined by the Court before the Court determines the question of the obligations of the People and the limited privileges and immunities the government may enjoy under the Internal Revenue Code, including the Anti-Injunction Act. <p> Please, find out more and support the fight to defend the constitution!
