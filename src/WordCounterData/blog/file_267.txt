I just joined this forum and introduced myself on the other thread. I wanted to post secondly on this thread as I 'd be overjoyed to have a juice fasting buddy for support, to hold me accountable( and vice versa), to check in, to vent( nicely with resolutions not negatively, haha), and to in general exchange daily or even a few times a week with one another. I plan to juice fast for a least one month, to include fruit and veggie juices... periodic water fasting when I 'm time crunching along with herbal teas just for taste and variety. <p> If anyone is interested, please message me and we can at least find out a bit more about one another.
