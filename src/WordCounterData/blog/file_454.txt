5153741 <p> Slightly Stoopid, whose members have been making music together for more than a decade, promises a concert experience audiences wo n't forget. The band 's performances, which focus on improvisation and crowd interaction, have become fan favorites? so much so that Slightly Stoopid has become one of the most successful independent artists of this decade. <p> The band has perfected the art of the stealth groove? that knack for quietly sliding into a composition and hooking everyone within earshot by mid-song. Their sound is built on a bedrock of bass, meditative vocal harmonies, rock-steady guitar licks and tightly syncopated percussion rhythms. It 's this eclectic mix of sounds that have afforded the band tour slots with a variety of artists over the years, including the Marley Brothers, blink-182, G. Love &; Special Sauce, Pennywise, and N.E.R.D. <p> Slightly Stoopid got its first break early. The band 's dual front men Miles Doughty and Kyle McDonald were signed to Sublime 's Brad Noewell 's Skunk Records label while still in high school in 1996. They later created their own label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moran and percussionist/vocalist Oguer " OG " Ocon, as well as C-Money( trumpet, keyboard) and Dela( saxophone). The group is currently touring in support of its latest album, " Top of the World, " which is goes on sale this month. <p> Tickets for the Oct. 14 show in Morgantown are $33 for the general public and $28 for WVU students with a valid WVU ID.
