5122141 <h> posted at 1:21 pm on October 26, 2012 by Ed Morrissey <p> There is an old saying that success has a thousand fathers, but failure is an orphan. That gives a lot of insight into the sequestration clause in last year 's debt-ceiling deal, which has not just left Barack Obama 's own Secretary of Defense warning about its " devastating " impact on the military, but also economists warning about the damage it will wreak on the economy. Obama tried to dodge responsibility for the sequestration when Mitt Romney criticized him for it during the final debate, claiming that " the sequester is not something that I 've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. " <p> That came as news to the man who literally wrote the book on that deal, Bob Woodward. Woodward teamed up with Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler this morning, and the result is four Pinocchios -- thanks to OMB chief Jack Lew 's attempt to shore up Obama 's false claim : <p> In sum : Director of the National Economic Council and Obama adviser Gene Sperling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew sold Harry Reid on the idea and then decided to use the Gramm-Hollings-Rudman language( which he knew from his days of working for Tip O'Neill) as a template for sequester. The proposal was so unusual for Republicans that staffers had to work through the night to understand it. <p> Oddly, Lew in Tampa on Thursday, publicly asserted the opposite : " There was an insistence on the part of Republicans in Congress for there to be some automatic trigger.... It was very much rooted in the Republican congressional insistence that there be an automatic measure at the end. " <p> This prompted Woodward to go over his notes and interviews once again, to make sure he had gotten it right. <p> " After reviewing all the interviews and the extensive material I have on this issue, it looks like President Obama told a whopper, " Woodward said. " Based on what Jack Lew said in Florida today, I have asked the White House to correct the record. " <p> We had been wavering between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew 's decision to double down on Obama 's claim, we agree it 's a whopper. <p> We noted the same the day after the debate, and the Daily Caller did as well. What 's interesting in this case is Obama 's efforts to distance himself from a proposal his own team succeeded in enacting through bipartisan efforts to solve the budget crisis. After all, Obama could have just responded that Republicans agreed with him, and argued that it showed the ability to work through crises on a bipartisan basis. Instead, Obama simply told a fairy tale, and the man who pushed the sequester with Harry Reid ended up backing him with another false statement. <p> If you want to see why this administration ca n't succeed at working across the aisle, this is a great example, although there are plenty of others( such as inviting Paul Ryan to a speech on the budget and then calling him un-American for his approach). Obama managed to get Republicans to agree to the sequester trigger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south, Obama blamed them not just for agreeing to it but falsely accusing his opponents of bringing it up in the first place. <p> But that 's not the end of the Pinocchios. Kessler gives Obama three more Pinocchios for his claim on the Tonight Show that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms. This repeated claim, Kessler writes, " suggests an intentional effort to mislead voters " : <p> The president has suggested time and again that Planned Parenthood directly provides mammograms, but the organization only offers referrals and helps women find financial resources for the exams. This suggests an intentional attempt to mislead voters about all the services that are at stake with decisions regarding federal funding for the controversial group. <p> Obama 's campaign points out that the incumbent was referring in each case to Planned Parenthood 's broader role as a health-care provider. But that does n't make his remarks any less inaccurate. <p> We wavered between Two or Three Pinocchios but ultimately decided the president earns Three Pinocchios for his mammogram remarks on " The Tonight Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one form or another for this to be considered reminder : Anyone who fails to comply with our terms of use may lose their posting privilege. <p> But that 's not the end of the Pinocchios. Kessler gives Obama three more Pinocchios for his claim on the Tonight Show that Planned Parenthood provides mammograms. This repeated claim, Kessler writes, " suggests an intentional effort to mislead voters " <p> Just saw that in today 's Gallup poll, not only is Romney up 51-46, but Zero 's approval dropped 3 points in one day. Today 's news out of Libya that he left those fine Americans to die alone, and then went to bed so he 'd be rested for his fund-raising trip to Vegas, wo n't be helping that number. <p> Obama tried to dodge responsibility for the sequestration when Mitt Romney criticized him for it during the final debate, claiming that " the sequester is not something that I 've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. " <p> In sum : Director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the idea of a sequester, while Jack Lew sold Harry Reid on the idea and then decided to use the Gramm-Hollings-Rudman language( which he knew from his days of working for Tip O'Neill) as a template for sequester. The proposal was so unusual for Republicans that staffers had to work through the night to understand it. <p> I 'm perfectly willing to believe that The Misfit Commie had no idea about his own apparatchiks doing something that he was unaware of. <p> This is what happens when all you 've ever done is ride the affirmative action train, all the way to the top. After all, even with his Ivy League " education, " he 's nothing but a Community Organizer. <p> I do n't know what 's worse : the fact that the media can say Obama lies, but they wo n't use the word ' lie ' or call him a liar ; or that today it does n't seem to matter that the highest office-holder in the land is a liar. <p> Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game plan the ENTIRE TIME. <p> Republicans were stupid to agree to it in the first place. <p> If Republicans had refused to incresae the debt limit, it would have FORCED a defacto balanced budget, because the government would not have been allowed to spend more than it brought in. <p> There is enough coming in on a monthly basis to pay our debt payments, pay our military, pay Social Security, and a bit left over. It 's just that that bit left over is not enough to pay for all of the other agencies. They would have been forced to downsize their spending to match the revenue available. That would have been a good thing, and likely would have prevented the downgrade in our bond rating. <p> Boehner blew it. He did n't understand why Republicans flipped more seats in 2010 than Democrats flipped in the wake of Watergate. He did n't understand that he was made Speaker for the specific objective of stopping the Democrats ' Cloward -- Piven agenda. <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama supporters. They probably could n't even spell sequestration, let alone understand it. So what if Obama lied about it? If Obama said he had nothing to do with something that they those evil Republicans say is bad, why, they are just going to believe Obama. <p>.... year, actually. Remember when Maerose Prizzi said that every month that passed without the **34;2233;TOOLONG Stimulus Act would mean ANOTHER 500 million Americans would lose their jobs??? <p> It is pathetic that Romney has not followed the tradition of having his own pre-presidential seal on lecterns. If he wants to look presidential and sound presidential he needs to act presidential. Where are the crowd fainters? Obviously he is not sufficiently swoonish. He needs to assume the pre-presidential mantel and talk about big nebulous ideas that no one can disagree. Now that 's presidential. It brings people together. Note to Mitt, stop with the details and wonkishness. No one cares! And why double down with the accountant running mate? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can we get back to big bird! " these things called air craft carrier " Obama is awsome with the put downs! In the immortal words of Joe Biden, " Barack has a big stick and knows how to use it! Your election choice could n't be clearer... the town accountants or the co-captains of the basketball team. <p> Who cares who idea that deal was? It DOES NOT excuse the GOP house which could have prevented it. <p> Two parties to every contract folks -- and no one put a gun to Crybaby John Boehner 's head to go along with this. This was his decision to go along... pure and simple. He did it for political reasons... political cowardice. He had a group of Tea Party freshmen barking at him to do something about the debt ceiling, with many calling for a shutdown in government. He did n't have the balls to shut down the government -- just like he did n't have the balls to pull $100 Billion out of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would. <p> So -- in order to satisfy everyone( particularly the cowardly lion within himself)... he cut a deal with the devil( Obama), it was n't the first he 's cut and it was n't the last. <p>.... year, actually. Remember when Maerose Prizzi said that every month that passed without the **34;2269;TOOLONG Stimulus Act would mean ANOTHER 500 million Americans would lose their jobs??? <p> Resist We Much on October 26, 2012 at 1:57 PM <p> I would laugh except this guy can be the next President in a heart beat. <p> Well that sort of overlaps #3 on my list, but I 'm starting to get that feeling. <p> Doughboy on October 26, 2012 at 1:57 PM <p> In 2010, Republicans flipped more seats than the Democrats flipped in the wake of Watergate. <p> I see no reason to believe that Republicans would have less seats in the House next session. <p> Redistricting has, if anything, made districts less favorable to Democrats. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turnout than 2008 turnout. <p> If you take the current make-up of the House, and assume that for each state the party which holds more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives now will continue to hold the most seats after the 2012 election, and also assume that that party will win that state 's overall popular vote in both the Presidential and Senate races( if there is one in that state), then Republicans should keep the House, win the Senate, and Romney wins with over 300 Electoral College votes. <p> So basically the Washington Post actively endorses repetitive lying.( They enodrse Obama, Obama lies repeatedly, particularly on the mammogram issue, Libya, etc.) I do n't think they have to look
