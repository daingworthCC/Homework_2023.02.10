5126241 <p> Facebook users here on Earth are n't the only ones shooting arm's-length self-portraits : NASA 's Curiosity rover over on Mars is doing it as well! Curiosity captured the image above a couple of days ago using its Mars Hand Lens Imager( MAHLI), which is attached to an extendable robotic arm. The image is actually a composite of 55 separate photos shot using the 2-megapixel RGB color CCD camera. If you 're wondering why the arm itself is n't seen extending into the photo -- as is seen when we humans capture this type of shot -- it 's because the arm can rotate out of the frame for each of the 55 smaller sections of the image, resulting in a stitched image that does n't show the arm at all. <p> The mosaic shows the rover at " Rocknest, " the spot in Gale Crater where the mission 's first scoop sampling took place. Four scoop scars can be seen in the regolith in front of the rover. <p> The base of Gale Crater 's 3-mile-high( 5-kilometer) sedimentary mountain, Mount Sharp, rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background to the left are the northern wall of Gale Crater. The Martian landscape appears inverted within the round, reflective ChemCam instrument at the top of the rover 's mast. <p> The space agency says that this type of self-portrait allows the scientists here on Earth to track the condition of the rover over time, since the MAHLI camera is the only one of the 17 cameras that can see certain parts of the craft. <p> I do n't get how this is a self portrait! What is holding the Camera??!!!

You put millions into a rover only to send it up with a sensor that is 6 years behind( now about 10 years behind)... <p> kyoshinikon <p> Next time send a Hero3 up... <p> dogs <p> if its a comp image, as well as removing the arm thay have managed to remove the shadow too -- why on earth( mars) would they do that? for what purpose? <p> http : **33;19116;TOOLONG Lars Allebrink <p> They chose the 2mpx sensor because of the bandwidth limitations of transmitting from Mars <p> http : **31;19151;TOOLONG Larry Roberg <p> If you 're wondering why the arm itself is n't seen extending into the photo -- as is seen when we humans capture this type of shot -- it 's because the arm can rotate out of the frame for each of the 55 smaller sections of the image, resulting in
