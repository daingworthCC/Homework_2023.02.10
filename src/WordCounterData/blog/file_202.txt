5128341 <p> " Oh, I see -- this is just going to be how it is from here on out, " said New York City resident Brian Marcello, coming to terms with the fact that an immense storm that cripples mass transit systems and knocks out power for millions in the nation 's largest metropolitan area can no longer be regarded as an isolated, freak incident, and will henceforth be just a normal thing that happens. " Hugely destructive weather events are going to keep happening, and they are going to get worse and worse, and living through them is something that will be a part of all our lives from now on, whether we like it or not. " <p> " I get it now, " Marcello added. <p>... <p> " Right now, Americans all across the country are watching the aftermath of this storm and at long last recognizing that this is what life is like now, " said Dr. Richard Morales, a climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania. " Admittedly, it could take a little while for some to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day, people will be much happier once they accept that they and their loved ones will likely suffer the consequences of an even stronger, more deadly hurricane at some point very soon. It 's going to happen. " <p> " I went through something very similar a few years ago when I finally came to terms with the fact that no one would ever listen to anything I said about global warming, " Morales added. " And that it is entirely too late to do anything about it. " <p> Here 's the thing : By massively overconsuming fossil fuels, we have essentially bet the future of our civilisation on the faint hope that the consequences will not be as catastrophic as the science expects. But the wolf is now at our door, figuratively speaking. <p> Scientific American 's blog reviewed the evidence on the link between catastrophic weather events and climate change. Read the whole thing, but here 's the key point : <p> Scientists have long taken a similarly cautious stance, but more are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intense storms and other extreme weather events, such as the warm 2012 winter in the eastern U.S. and the frigid one in Europe at the same time. They are emboldened because researchers have gotten very good in the past decade at determining what affects the variables that create big storms... <p> Climate change amps up other basic factors that contribute to big storms. For example, the oceans have warmed, providing more energy for storms. And the Earth 's atmosphere has warmed, so it retains more moisture, which is drawn into storms and is then dumped on us. <p> Furthermore, there is an emerging scientific consensus that even relatively " modest " levels of warming, such as the 2 degrees that international agreements see as acceptable, will result in unpredictably negative consequences. Here 's what leading scientist James Hansen had to say a year ago : <p> Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels before the industrial revolution were about 280 parts per million on average. They have been rising ever since, and today are about 397 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with an average global temperature rise of two degrees C. However, the latest analysis shows that a level of 450 ppm is enough to melt a significant portion of the world 's ice, because feedback mechanisms kick in ; melting ice hastens the melting of even more ice, for example, and thawing permafrost emits methane that accelerates warming, prompting permafrost to thaw even more. <p> If the number reaches 560 ppm, a doubling of preindustrial values, sea level globally could rise 25 meters, according to Eelco Rohling, professor of ocean and climate change at University of Southampton in the U.K., who presented data at the AGU meeting with Hansen. Many large cities worldwide lie at that elevation or lower. The two scientists agreed that if nations continue to emit CO2 at current rates, the world could reach 560 ppm by 2100. <p> The paleoclimate record also shows that 560 ppm would be enough to melt all the ice in the Arctic, and later the Antarctic. Rohling said that once the Antarctic melts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " If governments keep going the way they are going, " Hansen added, " the planet will reach an ice-free state. " <p> Seas rising 25 metres would be fucking disastrous. 70 metres would practically send us back to the dark ages - erasing most major cities and most of global economic activity, killing many prime agricultural areas with salt, and sending the survivors into the overcrowded highlands. You can use this interactive map to see what it would mean for where you live. <p> Here 's what my city would look like with a 20m sea level rise : <p> My office would sink, along with the whole city centre and waterfront. My flat would be high and dry, but there would be a mangrove swamp instead of a motorway just down the road from me. The houses that both my parents grew up in - which are on different ends of the city - would be underwater. The airport would be inundated. And, because the water would rise up through the Mangare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tasman, New Zealand would have three major islands. <h> No comments : <h> Disclaimer <p> This is my personal blog, and as a result represents nothing other than my personal thoughts at particular points in time.
