I like to share what I read and this blog is a great way to do that. This blog will also serve as a place where I may share random thoughts, challenges, questions, distractions and musings. Bear with me if you dare. I 'm often full of nonsense, sass, and stubbornness, but I 'll be the first to give you a smile or a hug if you 're in need. Feel free to make recommendations, tell me I 'm out
