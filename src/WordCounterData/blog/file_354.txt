5143641 <p> When it comes to sex, " late bloomers " may have a better shot at finding happiness in romantic relationships later in life, according to new research conducted at the University of Texas at Austin --but it 's complicated. <p> The research shows that people who lose their virginity at an older age are less likely to marry and tend to have fewer romantic partners in adulthood. But those who do end up in a committed relationship in adulthood tend to be happier with their partners than their peers whose first sexual intercourse came at an earlier age. <p> What 's the explanation? <p> " Individuals who first navigate intimate relationships in young adulthood, after they have accrued cognitive and emotional maturity, may learn more effective relationship skills than individuals who first learn scripts for intimate relationships while they are still teenagers, " study author Paige Harden, assistant professor in the university 's department of psychology, said in a written statement. <p> Interestingly, Harden suggested in a similar study last year that sexually active teenagers in romantic relationships tend to have fewer delinquent behavior problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sex is always ' good ' for teens is an oversimplification, " she said in the statement. " Teenagers ' sexual experiences are complicated. " <p> For her most recent study, Harden used data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health to examine 1,659 same-sex sibling pairs who were followed from approximately 16 to 29 years of age. During that time period, each sibling was classified as having first sex at an early, average( between 15 and 19), or late age. <p> The research showed an association between people who waited to have sex and higher satisfaction levels in adulthood romantic relationships, even after factoring in genetic and environmental factors, education level, income, religion, and physical attractiveness. But Harden said that more research is needed to determine what exactly drives an association between waiting to have sex and satisfaction in later relationships. <p> " Most people experience their first intimate relationships when they are teenagers, but few studies have examined how these adolescent experiences are related to marital relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to sex, " late bloomers " may have a better shot at finding happiness in romantic relationships later in life, according to new research conducted at the University of Texas at Austin--but... <p> When it comes to sex, " late bloomers " may have a better shot at finding happiness in romantic relationships later in life, according to new this a safe and supportive place for writers of all ages to contribute. <h> Loading comments... <p> offer a kid one cookie now, or two later. the kids that put off reward now for greater reward later are more likely to do better. <p> " Mischel and his many colleagues discovered that a child 's executive function is a critical component of intellectual prowess. We now know that it is actually a better predictor of academic success than I.Q. It 's not a small difference, either : Mischel found that children who could delay gratification for 15 minutes scored 210 points higher on their SATs than children who lasted one minute.

If they find someone willing to marry them they are happy and they stick with it because no one else will date them. Good looking people have sex sooner because they can. When stuff does n't work out they bail because they can easily pick up another mate. In the end the good looking person has more mates but never a solid long term satisfying relationship like the ugly person does who has a relationship not based on looks. feel free to change looks for talents or money and you get the same result. <p> kharrast : An alternative ugly people cant get laid as easily. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> I think it likely that someone who is late to marry has learned the skills to live independently, and may be less likely to marry out of fear of losing that independence. Article does n't make it clear whether or not surveyed people lived together. That seems to be more common than marriage for many folk. <h> Loading comments... <p> Omg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry, I just ca n't take this one seriously, there is SO much more involved in relationships than when the time someone has sex. Today there is contraception, women have choices they never had before, there are genetic factors like AD/HD, bi-polar disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and other disorders that lend themselves to impulsiveness or lack of " staying power " that are undetectable to teens but more apparent to mature adults.. the list goes on and on.. <p> I know my family lineage back to 1600 and ALL the women had sex as teens, they also had a baby or two or three because they were Catholic, French Acadians who got married, usually around age 18( but one as early as age 14), and they all had large families, stayed married( though two women died young, presumably from childbirth) and they lived to be quite elderly. My mother was the first divorced woman in 400 years of her family history! And she was one of those good Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three daughters have gone through the same thing something none of us anticipated years ago... My view is that the types of relationships we have change with increased education, career successes, affluence and once unimaginable choices( think internet dating sites and lots of pretty young women who think hooking up with a married man is just fine). <p> RoughCollie : Omg... this is such BS... lol.. I 'm sorry, I just ca n't take this <p> I did n't say people in the past were happier, I said they stayed married, had big families, lived long lives.. they 're long dead, how would I know if they enjoyed their spouses? I think happiness is relative and defined differently by each person and not determined by hormonal awakening. One person 's excitement is another 's phobia and one person 's slow, selective approach is utter boredom to another.. There is so much more involved. <p> Haha... you 've never looked at your own family tree... trust me, teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got married too, but nevertheless.... teens were designed to procreate and it ai n't gon na change in anyone 's lifetimes. <p> RoughCollie : Haha... you 've never looked at your own family tree... trust me, teens <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> Sex is a biological urge, like eating. If I am hungry, I eat. Sex should be the same way with the only caveat that you take precautions to avoid unplanned pregnancies or STD 's. Anything else is just moralistic nonsense from the right, put out to give them just another form of control over other 's lives. ' If it feels good, do it! ' is a good way to live your life( though do n't be cavalier with someone else 's feelings) and if more did it and were not burdened with the crushing weight of repression or guilt that the Moral ' Majority ' would like to saddle you with then the world would be a better place. <p> If there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine with that and would wait. If the reason was ' because( insert mythological deity here) says so ' or for the purpose of using sex as a weapon in marriage( which has worked ohhhh so well for the US--50% divorce rate) then NO I am not going to wait. I am 46. I have been around the block. I have been in relationships where I had to wait and ones where we were going like rabbits from date one. There is no benefit to waiting that I have seen. I was no happier and I 've noticed the one 's where I had to wait, if you put aside all the anticipatory excitement, the sex was usually pretty awful because righties are so repressed they do n't know how to enjoy their bodies. Aside from taking some time to ensure you are with a responsible person vis a vis STD 's, birth control, and the emotionally maturity to handle the intimacy( and frankly if you require MONTHS to get in that place then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see no reason to delay sex and I have had plenty of long term relationships. And putting off sex until after marriage is just freaking insane! <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> Ahhh Americans and their schizophrenia on sex... I exploded on the sexual scene very late( thank you Bible Belt!) but the one thing that astonished me is how repressed and just gawdawful many American women are in bed. In Europe they have none of the hangups about their bodies and ' doing things ' that American women have and so they are happier and come to the party on more of an equal level. Time to grow up America! <p> andreiib : Ahhh Americans and their schizophrenia on sex...

That was the reason I was a late bloomer ; my parents had so many rules about even going places with friends after school that every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great point. Me too. I had a dad who was a paranoid cop and who was convinced I was on drugs( so every ' friend ' was a potential drug dealer) so virtually my every move was monitored. I did n't dare date till I was out from under that. Personally I would have loved to have been active earlier. It would have built my confidence and made my early twenties a lot less lonely and sad. <h> Loading comments... <p> Part of the reason I 'm a ' late bloomer ' is because I refuse to drag a man into the BS that is my family. My family is the type of group where you have to be 100% like them right down to the type of clothes you wear and food you eat. And if you do n't conform you will be judged and put down until you either conform or get fed up and leave. It 's downright suffocating and I 've gone through severe periods of depression over it. <p> So with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear the thought of introducing someone I love to that situation. So I 'm waiting until I graduate and transfer to an out of state university. <p> My family is just like that! Only I decided to leave as soon as I could. I can understand your decision though, that was the situation my mom was in when she met my dad ; he broke the family down though, so I had a little bit more freedom. But I know if they found out some things about me, I would get disowned. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> Lost mt virginity at 29 after marriage to my wife. Was very difficult to wait till then, but I did. My wait did not matter extra special to my wife - a Doctor - though. She only cared whether I was a smoker( never smoked) and whether I had a good job, we before we got romantically engaged
