5115241 <h> Start small, launch and have no fear <p> Not too long ago I would never have said this : I love teaching. I 've been leading a digital strategy class at the University of Oregon since late 2010 after being invited to do so by the indomitable Professor Deborah Morrison. She worked on me for quite some time. I capitulated. <p> Last week Spring Term ended sending off 28 students of mine, who I now hope will spend quality time pondering advertising, apps, websites, user experience, digital products, mobile, designing for small screens and, most importantly, how the web and mobile are their own thing, in an entirely new light. <p> Each term when leading class I have to take two things into consideration : 1. a 22 year old student has been immersed in an ever-expanding digital universe from the moment she took her first steps. 2. I do n't believe one can be taught " digital marketing. " As my friend Justin Spohn has often said -- we ca n't learn " digital marketing, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is who knows more? Me, with my 18 years or more of hands-on digital immersion or my students who have simply " lived " it? I go with an acceptance that they have reached a remarkable level of digital cognition ; after all, anyone older than about 30 has had to immerse themselves into digital culture and adapt on the fly -- we were n't born into it. Today 's young people are already primed for a class like mine when they sign up. Where I may have a leg up is in my background of watching how at first people, and soon thereafter agencies and brands, gained an understanding of this brave new world that sat quite literally at their fingertips. People, or users, quickly took the lead in that race. <p> The good news is that everyone 's cognitive development re digital " anything " expands rapidly if one remains constantly curious and inquisitive. We ca n't deny the power of those brilliant digital platforms : they practically sing and hum with opportunity if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear their offerings. They 're no longer a mystery, they hide in plain sight. Unfortunately we 've seen marketers struggle with these platforms because when they see what they do, to them it does n't look like marketing. <p> That may seem like a harmless statement, but it 's not. I have a favorite example for why it is actually harmful -- Kodak. <p> All of the above is the basic foundation and roadmap for the class along with a nod to David Foster Wallace 's commencement speech, wherein he says you take a liberal arts education not just to gain an understanding of certain disciplines, but ultimately to learn how to think.. So in 10 short weeks the class has to whipsaw its way through the laundry list above. It can be frustrating for the students as they have to be willing to drop some deep assumptions, but it 's always enlightening for them. Me too, it 's a two-way street. <p> We cover a lot of ground. We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Without trying to sound too pithy, we must never send generations of fresh minds out into the world thinking that Facebook is the be all and end all of digital " strategy. " It boils down to a simple question that 's hard to answer -- what is advertising today? Then it gets more complicated -- where should it live? Why? The honest answer that you would get from me is that I 'm not yet certain. There can be no hard and fast rules in a developing medium, we have to rely on research and data but there 's endless opportunity and promise. Rather like the US Senator that quipped " I ca n't explain pornography but I know it when I see it.. " I find myself not wanting to describe advertising as that 's rather easy and obvious -- here 's a lovely, well-shot TV ad of a car etc -- so I know it when I see it. I 'm not sure that the Senator got to the same conclusion but I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be a better way.( Ok, not so much for porn..) <p> Of course people still watch lots of TV and listen to the radio and speed past billboards, and direct mail is still effective( often more so when measured against web banner CTR.) The web and mobile do not replace any of those outlets because, up first as espoused by Paul Ford, the web is not a meta-TV, a meta-billboard, a meta-magazine etc, it 's its own thing. And so is mobile. Neither of those platforms are built for campaigns either. And that 's why marketers struggle with the web and mobile.( NB : not all, but the majority.) The lesson here is simple -- research what your customers are doing and where they 're doing it, then build for them and the platform. <p> I want to pause here for a second and mention media channels. I took a break from writing this post and followed up on reading a post from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching at Boston University and lays out some thoughts re creativity. One of the comments caught my eye. It was from Ben Kunz VP, Strategic Planning at Mediassociates and he made some interesting points : <p> " What I find interesting is that within ad agencies, 99% of the conversation about what they do is focused on " the creative idea, " and yet outside of ad agencies, 99% of what people talk about in communications is the change in media channels. " Edit " People are obsessed with media channels and tools ; agencies keep talking about ideas. Therein is a disconnect. The intersection of media channel and creative idea is rarely explained, although a few smart shops such as BBH Labs have discussed ending the top-down creative to media funnel and building a more integrated planning whole. " <p> What Ben would like to see is ".. how the construct of media channel and the pinnacle of brilliant creative inform each other, instead of the " idea " itself being something separate. " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is media channel planning has to be a part of your digital thing rollout. File under : How will they find it? <p> Here 's a quick audacious aside : all media are now social so feel free to decouple the word social from media. <p> Back to the web Like my students, the web is an adolescent entering adulthood. Unlike my students it has had explosive growth. Like them it party 's like it 's 1999, except it does that 24/7.( Although yes, I know, some students try..) Now regular readers of my posts will surely find the next few paragraphs as old news but I 'm writing this post mainly for those that are not aware of certain information so bear with me. <p> The Mosaic web browser arrived in 1993 and then we were off to the races. We can then argue that 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the public facing web. The age range of my students falls between 20 and 22 years old. <p> Through Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work out that the web as a platform is a gift to them. They did n't accept the gift. They did n't accept the gift because it did n't look anything at all like what they were used to and how they did it. An analogy : " I do n't fish, why did you give me a fishing rod? " " Well if you learned to fish you might enjoy it, and once you get the hang of it it 's awesome! And it gets better, you might also provide a fresh healthy meal for your family once in a while.. " " No thanks, I 'm used to buying fish at the market, you can take back your rod. " And so it went. <p> Except marketers did n't stop there. They decided they should take the fishing rod, repurpose it and force it to work for them. They wanted to own it. It owned them so they tried to ignore it. And so we had Web 1.0. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, spurred on by the David Foster Wallace book, This Is Water mentioned above but also by the social media " expert 's " pitch to " Fish where the fish are. " The fish in this case really being Facebook users. Now I do n't know about you but I 'm not sure I want to fish in a pond that holds 900+ million " fish " with thousands of " anglers " dropping lines in it. The best fishing hole is the one that only you and a few friends know about.) <p> And then Web 2.0 gave rise to a much more social web, providing open source applications, much improved user experience and more social sharing tools than you could wave a stick at. Not a bad thing at all, especially all the pretty looking websites( I jest..) Except Web 2.0 gave rise to social media " experts " which was rather unfortunate. As I wrote above, the words social and media should be decoupled by now because the web has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stand-alone " social media " platform behind. And with the rapid take-up of mobile and the user experience around it, users have adapted to a whole different way of sharing. All media when shared is intrinsically social -- why else would you share it? And there 's that user experience. In a post I wrote last week about the failure of Apple 's Ping, I came up with a little formula based on the three strikes rule in regard to asking users to share : One-click sharing should be the mantra. Two clicks maybe.. Three clicks your Pinged. I mean, come on, think about all of our fat-fingered friends on those small screens please. <p> Oh, and by the way -- new buzzword alert : " Curation. " <p> Anyway, as usual I digress. Web 1.0 tends to be assailed because companies and brands piled in to building websites that were basically company brochures : List of top management? Check. Lots of drop-down menus that listed every nut, bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, especially animated gifs? Check. Really bad navigation and UI/UX? Check. The list goes on. We 've come a long way. And yet I ca n't help but wonder : if there is no huge shift toward Web 3.0, aka the Semantic Web, because mobile Internet traffic is now fast overtaking desktop traffic, will we ever get there?( Semantic Web is more about computer-generated content which I 'm not going to delve into here.) And if the Web 's rapid advance slows for a while, might we see well-designed company websites that echo Web 1.0 in terms of content? By that I mean a return to a website that lists everything the company does -- a website as a simple repository of information about the company from top to bottom. That 's the web thing -- all the user value for the brand is delivered solely in mobile. Just a thought. <p> 52 Things I Learned in Digital Brand Strategy Class by Katie Rauber <p> Back to class. The image above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took of a deck of cards that had been transformed( transmediated?) by one of my students, Katie Rauber -- it was how she delivered her final essay. Each card holds a quote or phrase, mostly of mine, that she 'd noted and written down over the last 10 weeks. It 's a tactile thing and that of course differentiates it from a digital thing. Tactile trumps digital in this case, as in many : Katie 's deck of transformed laminated playing cards linked with metal clasps existed to me as soon as she put it in my hand. Your digital thing exists only as ones and zeros until I interact with it. That 's where digital scarcity becomes an issue : why should I interact with your thing? How would I ever find it? Why would I want to? These are the very issues we spent a lot of time on in class. <p> Katie very smartly parsed and documented everything.( Well not everything. If she 'd done that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you get the idea.) As you wo n't have the privilege of holding this tactile object I 'll spell out those 52 insights, thoughts and quotes for you, with notes by me in parentheses : <p> 1. There is nothing new in digital( consider history and anthropology) 2. The Internet is challenging, not destroying journalism( newspapers maybe, journalism no) 3. The Internet is the largest group of people who care about reading and writing ever assembled in history( Clay Shirky) 4. There wo n't be a Web 3.0( See post) 5. Social networking is a feature, not a destination( for your brand) 6. Find the problem. And solve it 7. Dunbar 's Number : We can only stay in touch with 150 people( Cognitively, that is..) 8. The web is not some all-absorbing meta-medium( Paul Ford) 9. Facebook has no tangible products, only advertising and users( Revenue must come from ads, users may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it? Why will they use it? Where will they use it? How will they use it? What 's its value?( Questions to ask before building a digital thing) 11. Brands using Facebook are being tactical not strategic 12. Design for the user, UX is crucial 13. There tends to be a lack of consideration of human behavior within online brand strategy 14. YouTube : Everyday 8 years worth of video is uploaded( As per Google..) 15. The web is an anarchic, uncontrolled medium powered by people 16. All of your brand consumer insights may be in 1% of the collected data 17. Brands should wait to be invited to join in social networks( An oldie and now redundant given that all media is social. Even less control for brands) 18. If your app comes with user how-to instructions it has failed 19. Start small, launch and have no fear 20. The power of suggestion is everywhere. Online, ' influencers ' can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new website or your app solve for your customers/users? 22. Digital ca n't solve print media 's problems( why should it?) 23. All media is social 24. By 2014 tablets will drive the most web traffic from mobile users( Mary Meeker. Think iPad) 25. Mobile is now 26. Online, the only thing that 's scarce is attention 27. In digital we use behavior to reach people more effectively( forget demographics, that 's a holdover from TV and print metrics.) 28. The Internet is a socio-cultural sphere not a subculture( Zeynep Tufekci) 29. Radical transparency( still valid) 30. Social is for people. Marketing is for brands 31. We are social animals, technology simply shortens the distance between us 32. Social media was offered as a ' solution ' to a ' problem ' that did n't exist( see #31) 33. The web is people-powered( see #31) 34. The web helps reduce the friction of communication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35. It 's a basic human need to stay in touch with like-minded people( see #31) 36. Technology does n't drive our online interactions, we do 37. Brands should have a robust mobile e-commerce strategy 38. You ca n't blame technology because it does n't care 39. The web is its own thing( Paul Ford) 40. The social web is not going away( social web companies will though..) 41. The Internet does n't offer anything new in community building( people build communities) 42. There are no rules to creativity 43. Know your audience( or else) 44. Start with a minimum viable product 45. 81% of the top global Internet sites are outside the USA 46. You ca n't litigate human behavior 47. Apps can be tested and analyzed then updated based on user use. You ca n't do that with print or TV 48. 1% of your consumer data may hold 99% of the best insights( handle with care) 49. Ask : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your brand? 50. The Internet is simply a platform( handle with care) 51. Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution( Clay Shirky) 52. You ca n't learn digital marketing <p> And we can add a simple checklist of questions to this. Questions to ask before you embark on a new website or an app : <p> What problem does it solve? Who will use it? Why will they use it? Where will they use it? How will they find it? What is its value? <p> I 'll be spending summer working on ideas for my Fall class and I 'd like to leave you with this : Our memories and assumptions are untrustworthy. <h> Comments <p> great post. some media trivia that you probably know. 1950 there were 1.5 million tv 's in america. 1951 there were 15 million. department stores started offering credit. suddenly the networks had to produce things other than opera and drama. in order to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't changed much since. only other media, especially digital has forced it to be different. but too many planners are trying to use the digital realm in the same interruptive and annoying manner. good media planners have asked for some time why and how people use specific media ; is it knowledge media, community media, story media etc. makes for a far more sound system. <p> Good point about TV and its rapid ramp up in adoption. To that point, marketers had to adapt to a new platform almost instantly or get left in the dust -- and they did adapt. What we see now is an almost similar adoption rate of the web by people/users, but not the same embrace of the platform that we saw with TV. That suggests the discomfort that marketers have with the Web or they 're conflicted by having to work with the old and the new.. <p>... One of his most recent posts includes fifty-two maxims about marketing, the internet, technology and more -- pretty amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a freelancer trying to market services and products. One of the biggest problems for some freelancers -- I 'm thinking of freelance writers and editors here -- is catching up with the ever-evolving online world, its aesthetics, and its demands when it comes to keeping yourself and your brand as a freelancer as viable as possible.... <p> I have now come back to this post two or three times. Adding it to my Readability and Springpad and the places I save important stuff. This is good. I will use it
