5199741 <p> Long Island gas station owners with power are running out of gas, and it will be a few days before more can be delivered to most of them. <p> Many of the Island 's 6,000 gas stations overrun by drivers searching to fill their tanks are having trouble being refueled, as three of the area 's main terminals have lost power in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and ca n't supply tanker trucks waiting to deliver gas to retailers. <p> Major gasoline terminals in Lawrence, Inwood and Glenwood Landing have no power and are shut down and the Holtsville terminal has run out of everything but some diesel and home heating oil, according to Kevin Beyer, president of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association. <p> Beyer said the U.S. Coast Guard was keeping several barges loaded with gasoline from being unloaded in Port Jefferson, fearing debris in the water. Beyer has reached out to Sen. Chuck Schumer 's office to allow the fuel to be delivered. <p> With no power to pump, Beyer 's Performance Fuels in Smithtown is quiet. When power finally is restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of gas, so he 's still worried about supplying customers in the days ahead. Beyer said it could be at least a week before the supply of gas is back to normal. <p> Michael Watt, executive director for the gas retailers association, said the gas shortage is already effecting products shipped over the roads. <p> " Businesses have got to be judicious about sending trucks back and forth, " Watt said. <p> Drivers can expect gas lines to continue at area stations for the short term, but Watt said the situation " should be resolved by the end of the weekend. " <p> Suffolk County Legis. Tom Cilmi has called on LIPA to address the power outages at the three of four gasoline terminals that serve the Island. <p> " We are starting to see long lines at gasoline stations, " Cilmi said in a statement. " Gasoline is the lifeblood of our economy, particularly in Suffolk. With many gasoline stations out of service and those with power running out of gasoline, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> Cilmi said it was critically important that the terminals are back in service as soon as possible. <p> " Folks are already stressed emotionally and financially, " Cilmi said. " The last thing we need is to see gasoline prices skyrocket from their already historic highs, or worse, to run out of gas completely. This is exacerbating an already horrible situation.

You have to actually not visit the mall one day or stop shopping for a day or two? Gas will be here -- relax!!! <p> Drew says : November 1, 2012 4:53 pm <p> Some people need the gas to run generators so that they can feed their children and keep them warm. <p> April says : November 1, 2012 6:25 pm <p> Denise- you are extremely uncompassionate. Nobody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much that has been lost here. Perhaps since you have all the answers you can organize a group to help some of these people. You shall be judged my the same measure in which you judge. God help you <p> Rachel says : November 1, 2012 7:24 pm <p> i agree with denise its gas like really so u cant drive around for a day or too relax it will b here its not gone forever <p> Denise, It must be nice to be independently wealthy but some of us need cars to get to work. We do have families to feed, whereas your prioity seems to be shopping. Get lost. <p> Erik says : November 1, 2012 8:48 pm <p> The media has put everyone in panic mode. While some terminals or gas station may not have power or fuel. I pretty sure that not all gas station on Long Island or in New York City will complete run out. If this does happen, then maybe we as citizens should come up with alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care. <p> Aaron says : November 2, 2012 1:13 am <p> We 're not driving around galavanting, people. We have NO POWER and more importantly, NO HEAT without gasoline for our generators. We also have to drive to work because we have to support our families. Do n't be so naive. <p> Mary says : November 2, 2012 7:02 am <p> People are scrambling to keep their families with infants and children alive. It 's getting cold -- too cold for some to handle <p> we need gas to get to work, heat our homes, not go to the f*cking mall denise you idiot... i 'm glad you can sit home on your *** and relax but i have bills to pay and a family to take care of.... <p> Alyssa says : November 2, 2012 11:11 am <p> I think we all need to relax my tank is marked t half right now, am I worried? yes, but I am not in a panic I plan to go nowhere over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-week everything should start to pick up. if you need to take a day off of work due to lack of gasoline you will not die. maybe you will be short on bills due to losing the money but the world will not end. the media makes things worse just be greatful to be alive and well you will live without gas. <p> My son is in Merrick, NY. He is trying to help the people with their clean up. There is a shortage on gas, people need it for generators so they will have some type of heat. There are many elderly people who are in need of medical treatment and young children. It is not a matter of crusing town and handing at the mall. Not to mention they can get the standing stinky water out of the homes without genitors that need gas. <p> Since some people have all the answers, why do n't you take the time to volunter to bring gas from an outside state to keep some the these people warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2, 2012 12:09 pm <p> I live in the North Bellmore/North Merrick area and while I am extremely inconvenienced, I do believe that this panic from many is ridiculous. We should be worried about our neighbors on the shorelines and ration gas for those who TRULEY need it, like those without homes who need to relocate. For those who are complaining about the weather, look at the stats, it has not gotten below freezing! Unless you are elderly or live in an extremely poorly insulated home, BE THANKFUL YOU HAVE FOUR WALLS AND A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD! Gas will be back within the week, stop driving around for hours, sit at home with your families and be thankful for what you have, and when the gas starts flowing again fill up and drive to one of the many devastated areas and donate some items or volunteer( I know I have already signed up) <p> Adam says : November 2, 2012 12:42 pm <p> Please keep your ' calm down advice ' to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using the gas to fill a generator to keep warm or have to go to work because their job has electricity and they must go. So keep your self serving advice to a minimum and try to help others with locations that might have gas for this short term energy shortage. <p> Lauren says : November 2, 2012 1:45 pm <p> I think everyone needs to calm down yes people need to get to work and heat their homes no one is disagreeing with that. But people also need to be sensible when it comes to their generators do not run them as frequently. Yes it is cols but not snowing so be grateful pile on the extra blankets and huddle together. During irene i lost power for five days but i had a roof over my head and i was grateful. Live a little uncomfortably is not going to kill you. People are so concerned with having heat and modern conviences they can not live without them. This is not a permanent situation you have to adjust for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world. My dad is traveling from the north fork to melville everyday to work and he is making do. People need to ration that is the point. <p> Frank says : November 2, 2012 7:40 pm <p> Denise, it seems that you do not realize some people need to go to work. Your life is no more than shopping?
