5133841 <h> 09 Nov 2012 -- Henning <p> Hew is the new collaborative project between Rachel Evans aka Motion Sickness Of Time Travel and Nevada City, California-based visual artist Juli Toro( who not only did the artwork on the left but also the cover art for MSOTT 's self-titled LP on Spectrum Spools earlier this year). The two have just readied their first cassette named Domoboi, a four-track effort that 's not too far away from Evans ' ambient-leaning solo ventures. We 're happy to premiere the video for one of the tracks off the tape, " In the Center of a Room ", made by Rachel Evans herself. As usual with her work, sound and vision align perfectly, the restrained pictures creating a dense, absorbing atmosphere
