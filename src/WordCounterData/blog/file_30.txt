5111041 <p> To say the least, it was unexpected. I get nice emails from fun and interesting people regularly, but this really stood out as something special. <p> I started following Andy( and his human companion) on Twitter a few weeks ago after seeing them wandering around Portland. When I got the card I laughed out loud. Then, I immediately went to Andy 's website to see what he was up to. <p> As far as I can tell, Andy is n't trying to sell anything, he 's just a very cool stuffed animal. Andy likes to send people postcards because he 's a nice... whatever he is. <p> The day after I got the card from Andy, I went to my local post office to send some mail. I needed to ship a few water bottles to Hawaii, so I asked the clerk to help me find the cheapest option. She scratched her head and made some funny faces before telling me I 'd have to buy a padded envelope and send them for $10. <p> Halfway through filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey, would n't it be half as much if I just put these in a priority envelope? " <p> She perked right up and declared, " Why yes, it would! Do you want to send your package that way? " <p> Of course I did, so we switched and started processing the transaction. Before we finished, she reminded me that I 'd already written on the envelope she gave me, so I 'd have to pay $3 for that. <p> Really? You give me bad information and make me pay for it, too? <p> I did n't say that, but I was certainly thinking it. <p> By this time, the line was getting long behind me, and I 'm not the type to argue over $3. Usually, I 'll pay whatever it takes to get out of the post office as fast as possible! <p> As I left, though, I could n't help but think about Andy and the card he sent me yesterday. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal sends me a nice note with no expectation of return. The next, I 'm being extorted by my own mail lady. <p> Walking out of the post office, the only thing I could think was, " The world needs more Andys. " <p> These are both minor events? things I could easily overlook in the course of day. But I 'm glad I did n't. Andy and the mail lady reminded me of an important lesson about life : <p> If you want someone to remember you, do something out of the ordinary. If you want people to remember you fondly? do something remarkable. <p> This is at the heart and soul of Advanced Riskology. To lead a better life, step out of your comfort zone and do something worth remembering. <p> Now, this lesson is at the front of my mind each time I get an email. It 's what I think about as we get closer and closer to launching our coffee subscription service. It 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get one chance to make a first impression, so I ask myself : Do I want to be more like Andy, or more like the mail lady? <p> Will you join the cause? Will
