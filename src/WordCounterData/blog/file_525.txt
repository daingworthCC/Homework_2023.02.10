5160941 <h> It 's Easier to Find Out Big Mac 's Ingredients Than Chipotle 's <h> get healthy living updates <p> A few weeks ago, Ecorazzi co-founder Rebecca Carter started a petition asking Chipotle, the company with the motto? Food with Integrity,? to live up to their own standards by providing customers with a full list of ingredients. Right now, it has gathered just over 2100 signatures. But more are needed to get Chipotle to understand that companies can? t expect consumers to blindly trust them. Transparency is vital. <p> In the fast food world, they are one of the good guys. They source local when possible, use dairy free from synthetic hormones, use some organic items, support Prop. 37( labeling of GMO? s), and so much more. So why is it that companies like McDonald? s, Subway, Wendy? s, Dunkin Donuts and Burger King are all willing to disclose a complete list of ingredients while Chipotle won? t? Should their motto be changed to? food shrouded in secrecy? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food Babe? Vani Hari tried to find out from Chipotle what ingredients specifically are used in their food. Unfortunately, she couldn? t get a straight answer. She even went so far as to have a meeting with Chipotle? s Director of Communication, Chris Arnold, but without much success. He said it would be too difficult right now to make the ingredients public, while on the Facebook page, Chipotle said that they keep it secret so that competitors won? t copy their recipes. <p> It seems to us that if Chipotle? s goal is to serve up their food with integrity, asking for a bit of transparency shouldn? t be too much of an imposition. Companies that don? t do nearly as much for people, the planet, or animals are willing to show us what? s under the hood. Shouldn? t we, as consumers, have the right to know exactly what we? re putting in our bodies? Each and every person who signs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they claim to be. Let customers have all the information so they can decide if the food is right for them. <p> As some have noted, on Chipotle? s website, they do list a vague account of what? s in some of their foods, but they only list the big ticket items. Obviously we know that the beans are made out of beans, but they don? t mention what kinds of oils their foods are cooked in or even list the tortillas. Food Babe found out that the beans are cooked in soybean oil, but as that doesn? t sound nearly as sexy as the description on the website that says,? Our black beans are seasoned with cumin, garlic and other spices, then slow cooked until tender and slightly al dente.? Instead, they chose not to list it. Are there other things they choose not to list? <p> We believe consumers should have all the facts, not just the ones that make a company look good. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to live up to their name. Sign this petition and help them find their way back? as they seem to have lost their way a bit. Integrity should be backed up by the full truth. <p> Ecorazzi has been providing the latest in green gossip since August 2006. The environment is serious stuff. The same goes for animal rights and humanitarian issues. But that does n't mean that it needs to be complex and boring! Ecorazzi takes the latest in celebrity gossip and entertainment news and filters out all of the fluff. What 's left are fun and interesting stories that you want to hear about, without the guilt. <p> Leave Chipotle alone!!!!! Why is it important to know this? If they do not want to share their secrets and ingredients leave them alone! Gosh this is becoming really annoying! If you are so worried about what is in their food do n't eat there!!!! Get your nosey busy body nanny state mingers out of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time exposing secret recipe( How, What and why taste good). Danger, someone can replicate it and sell it in local restaurants for own purpose. Become Intellectual/ Copyright property. <p> To be fair in all business, ask every national franchises( Dickey BBQ Pit/ Taco Bell), state franchises( Pappadeux, Taco Bueno) Mom and Pop( Local) restaurants to list all ingredient. <p> Once you know how food is prepared for the mass market you 'll probably never eat out again. I know watching tv programs showing food being prepared ie ingredients used or exposing behind the scenes cleanliness issues at restaurants has stopped me
