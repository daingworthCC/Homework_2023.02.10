5148541 <h> Zumba Sex Scandal Is Going to Ruin More Than One Marriage <p> The Zumba sex scandal just gets juicier and juicier. Earlier this week, the list of names of men who paid for sex with Alexis Wright, the hot Zumba fitness instructor accused of being paid for sex with more than 100 men, was revealed in Kennebunk, Maine. Her name has been plastered all over the papers for a week, but now it 's the men 's turn. And what a turn. <p> There are laywers, a former mayor, businessmen, and captains of industry, most of whom are married and have a lot to lose. It 's not good for them. But it 's not good for women, either. Think of all those wives who are finding out their husbands are on that list. Pretty awful, no? <p> With more than 100 men expected to be " outed " here, I 'd say the sweeping lesson in love and marriage is this : men can be real dogs. Sure, not ALL men, but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her 20s and forget their wives for a night. Sorry. It 's true. <p> Ninety-nine percent of the comments on this post will say that THEIR husbands would never cheat. The other one percent will claim that they are cuter than this woman( insert eye roll). But having known a good many men in my life, there are very few I know who have not or would not cheat on their wives in the right circumstances. <p> Believe it or not, many men are n't totally honest with the women in their lives. I have heard stories from men( when they are open) about oral sex with hookers( " do n't tell my wife! ") and more, and the most common refrain is this : " It 's not cheating if I pay for it, right? " <p> Wrong. <p> It 's cheating and it will hurt your wife. Forget the diseases( or do n't because honestly? Yuck). Let 's focus instead on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- even one you pay -- IS cheating. <p> So these men get hung out to dry in public. But my guess is the pain their wives feel in private is far, far worse. It must be beyond humiliating. What dirty dogs. <p> ca n't decide whether she is a mother, writer, or runner, but is usually all three at some point each day. She has written for dozens of print magazines, newspapers, and websites. She rarely ever writes on bathroom walls. <h> Featured Videos <h> Comments( 13) <p> sure, anything is possible. i 'd never go on record and say " my husband will never cheat on me! " because i 'm no fortune teller. however, i can assure you that he and i do everything possible to maintain a committed and loving relationship - something that may have fallen by the wayside for some of the guys on this list. <p> it 's not just men, either. people can be terrible in general, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbreaking that so many women have this type of men in their lives. My father, my brother, my husband, most of the men I know - they are above such behavior. They are real men, capable of facing temptation and walking away. No one can ever claim that someone would " never " cheat, obviously. But no, men are not all the same, and it 's degrading to men and dishonest to women to make that claim. <p> I absolutely think my man would cheat given the right circumstances. For another thing, I 've often found that the people who act above reproach are more prone to having secrets like this. Sorry, this is just what life has taught me. <p> I 'm an avid reader of this site, but almost never a poster, but this hits so close to home that here goes. I 've been married 8 years to my husband, been with him for 9, we have 3 kids( 7, 6, 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous relationship. We do everything together, the only time he 's not home is when he 's working( 2 full time jobs so I could be a stay at home mom and we could still save up for a house... sounds great right?). I NEVER thought he would do anything behind my back. Why? B/c he always said he 'd never want to get hurt like that himself, so why would he do it to someone else?( Good old golden rule right?) He was out of the country for a few days visiting family, and on the morning he was coming home from the airport, I walked by his car taking out the garbage and had an OVERWHELMING urge to look inside.( Trust your intuition ladies, ALWAYS!). I never snoop, and am in his car all the time, but i had a feeling and went with it. And yea I found 20, that 's right, 20!!! phone numbers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat but I definitly cant say 100% that he wont. Or me either for that matter. We are all human and can make mistakes. I Do hope if he becomes a dirtbag and does cheat he has enough sence to wear protection!! lol. <p>( cont.) This only happened last week. I 'm now down 10 pounds from constant panic attacks and nauseousness. When I questioned him, it was, oh since he works nights doing deliveries, prostitutes are always around handing out their #s and he took them for his friend( who I do know for a fact uses them).... Right, so why do you still have them??? Eventually I dragged out the supposed truth that he and a coworker( who btw is 45 and lives at home in mommy 's basement) had a contest to see who could collect the most # 's. Again this supposedly went on for 6 mos before I found out. He knows I do n't forgive people( used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself now), in fact I disowned my own father b/c of all his lies and abuse over the years. Anyways, apparently it was more important to get this guy 's approval than to keep his wife 's. Me, the woman who bore his kids, takes care of him, makes sure he gets IT at LEAST 2xs a day!( sorry tmi I know but come one! The a$$ had everything at home for him!) I called all the girls and not a one remembered him( gave his whole description b/c I doubt he used his real name, but gave that too just in case he 's THAT stupid). Most were sympathetic and awesome( which also makes me feel bad for them b/c it 's hard to find a decent guy on Long Island and they were just notches on his ugly ego belt). <p>( cont again) So now we 're in " sorry sorry sorry give me a 2nd chance zone, " which I 'm giving him, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep his word( really, how much can you love someone if you 'll do that behind their back?) and at least this way when they 're older they wo n't be able to blame me for not trying to make it work. In the meantime our house is almost done and I 'm saving money on the side b/c in all probability his tail wo n't be between his legs for too long. I think the only " good guy " I 've ever known is my brother, whose reaction to this was " Are you f'ing kidding me what is he 13 years old? Do I have to talk to him? Knock out his teeth? Tell me what you need. If I had my own house I 'd say move in right now. " So anyways, I guess moral of the story is trust YOURSELF and your gut before you trust anyone else. And I suppose there are some good ones out there, I just have n't met any aside from my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to cheat- but I am not naive. If he cheated, but world would crumble, but not because I did not consider it possible. I think woman that do probably are n't mature enough to be wed ; you have to consider every possibility in life. But i will never live my life in fear, phone checking and spying. You need to have a happy medium. <p> Im not saying men do nt cheat.. But so do girls. And i think its pathetic that the majority of men the author knows would like to cheat, sounds like a bunch of winners you 're hanging out with!! Cheaters should be the exception, not the rule. I know people cheat. But i do nt know that many married people who take their union so lightly. And i can say without a doubt that i do nt know any guys who think it 'd be cool to be with a whore. And trust me, I 've been good friends with some slutty guys.. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty gross. Maybe if you 're surrounded
