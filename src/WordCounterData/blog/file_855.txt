How have you seen your district change since first coming to office? <p> SENATOR MIKE STACK( MS) : Northeast Philadelphia has always been a collection of neighborhoods where hard working families make a living, buy a home, and help their children get a good education. And community banks are a big part of that. They provide financial services that help families finance their portion of the American Dream. That dream includes home ownership, college, or owning a business. <p> My constituents have always been predominantly working families. We are very proud of our working class roots. The district is becoming more ethnically diverse, and the new groups have the same working class values and attributes. <p> The economy, globally, is not the same as it was when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my tenure has been and will continue to be bringing jobs back to our region. <p> The challenges for the middle class are so much more significant and we are meeting them.

Mike McGeehan, Councilman Bobby Henon, and the Holmesburg and Upper Holmesburg Civic Associations to transform a dilapidated former public housing site into dorms and athletic fields for Holy Family University. The site will also include senior housing, retail shops, and restaurants. <p> This project will be a huge job creator, an economic force providing long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level, we worked together to turn a community eyesore into a positive community anchor that will spur additional positive development. We really made a difference and those are the moments I enjoy most. <p> Read the full interview in October 's issue of Transactions Magazine. Are n't a subscriber?
