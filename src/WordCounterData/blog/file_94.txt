5117441 <h> A short history of presenting : CPD23 Thing Seventeen -- The Medium is the Message( Prezi and Slideshare) <p> Since the later years of primary school, I 've dreaded the following phrase -- " assessment by presentation ". But in looking back, that horrible history is also a history of presentation technologies. In my first presentation( at primary school), about my collection of dolls in their national dress from all over the world, I had the actual collection of dolls on the table, my script written out in my own fair hand, and my presentation written on the blackboard. It was a time of technology most tangible. In First Year at secondary school, I got all high-tech and introduced a video clip as part of my history of Garfield, the Jim Davis magnum opus. At university, presenting got hardcore. It all started with flipcharts, marker pens, and groupwork ; I bear the scars thereof even now. But the blank canvas of Powerpoint was not far behind, as I signed up for the University 's IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever since. Hopefully I 'm not the only who initially carried away with all the fancy possibilities that Powerpoint offers. Who could resist the swishy noise of text rushing in from off-slide? Obviously, as time goes on, such gimmicks in your own presentations annoy you, and in others ' presentations, can inspire murderous feelings. See also : not switching off the keytones on mobile phones. These days, I use Microsoft Powerpoint primarily for user education sessions in my Library. Until last year, when I bought a new tiny laptop in advance of going to Canada, I had never used other presentation programmes ; now I use Open Office ' s Powerpoint alternative, particularly for conference presentations, and have had no problem at all therewith. It 's particularly helpful that Powerpoint presentations are compatible with Open Office without there being any formatting issues. <p> The CPD23 Thing Seventeen official post says " Prezi is now a very well known presentation tool and a great alternative to PowerPoint ". O dear ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day of discovery, as on the BBC 's Children in Need they have been talking about Gangnam Style all evening, which I had never heard of it before, but now I see that even Ai WeiWei has released his version. <p> Note : I did not finish this post on Children in Need last night, but the unexpected " bonus " of that is that I 've now just seen Bruce Forsythe and everyone on Strictly Come Dancing doing another version of the aforementioned Gangnam Style. <p> Back on topic : My name is Kathleen O'Neill and I have never used Prezi. However, I was intrigued by the official Thing Seventeen post 's suggested technique of " Using a circular structure to link solutions to problems, allowing you to visit and revisit areas of the screen as you talk ". One of my user education presentations is all about referencing, and I know that there are points where it would be good to be able to go back... and back, and back, and back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing how difficult it can be to keep an eye on when to use a colon, when to use a semi-colon, so it would be great to keep coming back to that. The main problem, however, is that it 's a horribly boring point to discuss( colons vs. semi-colons) ; I 've just gone through Meg Westbury 's presentation A Voice in the Wilderness : Personalised Library Services in a Virtual Environment, and for the first time saw a way to make such a dry presentation as that on bibliographic referencing into something that might not result in students losing the will to live. I had already been planning that after Christmas I would start looking at updating my user education presentations in the run-up to the students starting to work on dissertation proposals. Now I think that I will be reinventing all these presentations using Prezi, " getting my hands dirty ", as recommended in the offical Thing Seventeen post. I commented earlier that I found Powerpoint rather gimmicky in its special effects, often irresistibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual effects of Prezi, on the other hand, as used by Meg, were impressive and not " Powerpoint-tacky ". They complemented the presentation, as opposed to overwhelming it. No more swishy text from off-slide for me! <p> In the meantime, perhaps it would be a good idea to pull all my previous user education presentations together in one place, thus to work through them steadily. For now, different versions of them exist in different places : on datastickes, on my personal networked folders at work, and on my own folders on my own computers. I have kept copies of the various versions to show the development of my user education scheme for the purposes of my CILIP Chartership portfolio. So my first step should be to gather them together in one folder, and to keep a backup thereof. Why not use Slideshare? I already use it to look at Powerpoint presentations created by others more skilled than I in their creation. I have an account, and looking at my history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Taxonomy Folksonomy Cookbook : finding the right recipe for organising enterprise metadata. But since then, nothing. I have tonight been using Slideshare to find presentations that may be relevant to my primary writing project( under AcWriMo) ; one such is Gardening in a Knowledge Federation, by Jack Park( 2009). I am equally interested in Slideshare in terms of its making publicly available any presentations uploaded thereto ; I would like to get feedback on my user education scheme, and on the presentations around which it is structured. I can also look at others ' presentations on similar themes, and hope that once I improve my own work it will help others. <p> In the meantime, I am particularly intrigued by the idea of the visual CV. As my experience grows, I find it difficult to confine myself within the two page structure of the standard text-based CV. Does there come a time where it is acceptable to have a longer CV as a matter of course? I do not know. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one job interview, a long time ago now, I had to give a short presentation on my understanding of the library in the larger arena of an academic institution ; I answered that question partly through a series of diagrams. Could I similarly incorporate my approaches to my profession and my research into a presentation, and in so doing explain my attitudes with more sophistication and substance than is possible in two pages of( largely) plain text? At the very leaST, I plan to do so as part of an exercise to reevaluate and ultimately rewrite my CV to include all the experience gained, the
