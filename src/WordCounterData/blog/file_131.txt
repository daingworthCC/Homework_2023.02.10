5121141 <h> See you at the Poll? <p> Politics. One of the most uncomfortable topics of discussion for absolutely everyone.... <p> Wait! Stop! Do n't hit that big red " X " button at the top right of your screen! This blog is n't going to be what you think it 's about. No, I 'm not writing to you guys today to convince you to vote either Democrat or Republican. I 'm writing to you guys because I want you to VOTE. Period. It 's none of my business who you vote for, but I have made it my business to encourage you to exercise your rights, and check a little box on a piece of paper( it 's really that easy). <p> As young adults, this will be some of our first times to be able to vote. For me, this will be my second and I feel like it is important now more than ever. It 's also important to both care and understand what/who you are voting for. I feel like a lot of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually important, voting being one of them. I do n't think some of us realize how greatly affected we can be by our decision to NOT cast your vote. Do you guys even know when you can vote?( P.S. November 6 th a.k.a. TODAY! Polls close at 7:30PM). Take a second to look up or talk to someone about what the candidates are about. Be careful were you get your information from though, it 's always important to check your sources and to think critically about the information you 're receiving( sorry, that 's the speech teacher coming out of me). Being from North Carolina, I had to make an extra effort to be able to vote and received an absentee ballot a few weeks ago( thanks for the help, mom!). <p> I officially mailed my ballot last Friday. <p> So, what if you 're from West Virginia and can go to a voting station? Well, I took the liberty of making this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although this blog was n't as related to health, fitness, or Huntington as the rest, I feel as though it is more relevant to you as a college student than you know. Think of it this way : If you do n't vote in this general election now, you will have to wait FOUR MORE YEARS until you can do it again. That 's an entire college career for some of us. So go out and be an active seeker of information... learn, grow! We all want to be treated like adults, so we all should start acting like one. Now I want to leave you guys with something that I try to instill in my CMM 103 students : It will always be better to be educated, than to be ignorant, and there will never come a day when you are n't presented with an opportunity to learn. <p> So go learn something, and exercise your right to vote! You owe it to yourself and everyone around you. Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you voted for, I 'm very superstitious and am under the firm belief that if you say it out loud you automatically
