5186241 <h> The Attitude of Gratitude <p> The election is over. May we all give thanks! <p> If you know me at all, you know that it did not turn out the way I hoped for, the outcome I prayed for nor the way I voted, but can we all get an AMEN that the mailboxes are no longer filled with political flyers, Facebook is a kinder, gentler place, and I can watch television without getting mad?( I started to say that my phone had stopped ringing off the wall, but that is n't true. Believe it or not, we are receiving calls gearing up for the NEXT election!) <p> Enough to make me say, " Bah! Humbug! " except this is the season of Giving Thanks. <p> You may have noticed that many are counting their blessings this season. Face book has been filled with the daily counting of blessings by my friends. I, too, have been keeping a blessing journal of sorts after reading Ann Voskamp 's One Thousand Gifts two years ago. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget. But I also know that I find myself more grateful today than two years ago. It is TRUTH. The more grateful I am, the more grateful I become. <p> Have you ever met a curmudgeon? Someone that can out grouse you no matter how bad things are in your world? Their glass is for sure half empty and if you listen to them, they 've never gotten a break at a half full glass. <p> It 's contagious. <p> The next thing you know, your attitude takes a dive, even if it is because the curmudgeon spoiled your good mood! <p> I have a friend who calls them people who " poison our wells. " Another friend calls them Mr. or Mrs. Draino. If your well is n't poisoned they have certainly drained all joy from the day. <p> But joy is even more contagious. Thelma Wells opines that the world did n't give us our joy, so we ca n't let the world take it away! <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the economy, it does n't have to steal your joy. You may be thinking, " But Kim, you do n't know what I 'm going through. " and I do n't. But I know a God who does and He says to count it all joy when we face trials of many kinds. James 1:2-3 <p> Not easy to do. But as the saying goes, nothing good comes easy and neither is cultivating an attitude of gratitude and yet, He asks us to. <p> For me, this is one of those **31;6565;TOOLONG parts of Christianity. We can spout lots of platitudes. We can say that if our salvation was the only thing He ever did for me, it is enough and I am grateful. And it is. And I am. <p> But am I when my kids drive me crazy or there is more month than money or the check out girl is snippy when I remind her of the sale price? Am I when I am sick and tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot on their cupcake order that the frosting just has to be blue? And I stand looking at 4 dozen white frosted cupcakes already boxed and then the clock saying 8 pm? Am I when life is just not working the way I think it should? <p> The answer is not always. But I am trying. And I have found two things. <p> 1) He is faithful. And no matter what happens, He is faithful and the things that come as a monkey wrench in my day are no surprise to Him. He is teaching me to trust Him. And trust this. And rest in it daily. That the small things that drive me crazy are all things that He uses to work together for good. And for that I can be grateful. <p> 2) Gratitude grows gratitude. You just have to begin because He asks it of us. Actually commands it. " Count it all joy! " He says through James. " Rejoice in the Lord always! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must. <p> I am working to start each day before my feet hit the floor by thanking Him that I am awake, I have another day, I am warm in my house, I have meaningful work to do when I get up, and I have people to love who love me. <p> That 's a great beginning! I find the more I praise, the more I find to praise Him for. Small graces( hot buttered toast, a warm bath, a cup of good coffee, a car that starts in the cold, that I have breath in my lungs and a heart that beats). Large graces( His love and forgiveness even though I fail every day, the beautiful, bountiful love of my dear husband who is truly my dream come true, that He has given me more than I could ask or imagine in my family, my beautiful kids, my life). <p> And so it goes. Would you join with me and begin to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about the election was the sense of entitlement that we have created by no one ever being wrong, no one ever losing and no connection between hard work and success. The rhetoric was ugly on both sides. Gratefulness can change that. As the old song goes, " Let
