5177741 <h> He was one of them friendly bears.... <p> Once again, I did not see him in the wild.... I saw him( or her) and a few other Kodiak Bears at the Olympic Game Farm in Sequim, Washington on the northwest coast of the state near Port Angeles. I was here back in 2000 and the only reason I found this place was because I saw a brochure at my hotel as I was leaving. I wanted to come back here and I was happy to find out it was still open when I was getting my activities for my trip ready. <h> Comments and faves <p> Thanks Brian. This was one of the few bears who actually looked at you rather than look away except when you were tossing bread to them. The drive have very few cars so I was in front of each bear for 5-10 minutes each.... and then drove back around after I bought more bread. The bears are only 10 feet from you with no barrier except for a low electric fence which the bears did not seem to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very carefully! I am glad about you being in a car and the fence in between ; -) Otherwise I would n't trust him... ; -) But great you can get so close to them, they are impressive animals! <p> They know their boundaries and they just sit next to the fence because they know we have food. I was able to turn the car off, stick my little point and shoot camera out of the car and take a close photo. On my better camera the bigger lens was useless..... they were too close. <p> I took about 120 photos between the good camera and my small point and shoot which was easier to hold as I held it out my window and was within a few feet of the bears. I will post more of the pics later. <p> This place by far gives you the best photo ops for seeing bears up close. I have the extra zoom lens for my " superior " camera and I could not use it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of one eyeball. <p> &lt;a href= " http : **29;363376;TOOLONG... title= He was one of them friendly bears.... by Hazboy, Flickr " &gt;&lt;img src= " http : **30;363407;TOOLONG... width= " 500 " height= " 375 " alt= " He was one of them friendly bears....
