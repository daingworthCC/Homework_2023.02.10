5202141 <p> The governor and his cabinet are expected to discuss the Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts while at Stockton Avenue and Ocean Avenue in Seaside Park. <p> Christie has made almost daily stops to some of the areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, such as Long Beach Island and coastal Monmouth, but this is his first stop at Seaside Park since the storm. <p> Many communities today began allowing limited, hour-long access over the closed Route 37 bridge for full-time residents to grab essential supplies. Bellcrest Plaza on Fischer Boulevard in Toms River has been set up as a registration area for those seeking access. <p> Check back to this article after the press conference for a full article on the governor 's comments. <p> Can some reporter ask him for some legitimate reasons for the indefinate ban on residents driving to the undamaged areas of the island?

If it is unsafe he should get himself out of my town. It is unbelievable that he is keeping my from my home and now I will have to commute an hour and 15 minutes to get to class during the spring. I hope the government pays me back for all the gas. This is utterly ridicules. I honestly think we should all march across the bridge and go home. The bridge is fine.
