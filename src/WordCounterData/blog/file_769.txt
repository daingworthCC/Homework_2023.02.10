Guided by this animating vision, advocates argued that the world needed to renounce war, to educate youth about the benefits of peace, to disarm, and to create new institutions for resolving disputes. <p> The outbreak of World War I in 1914 shattered such idealism. Post-war efforts to regain ground faltered in the crescendo of violence that was World War II. Nonetheless, in the postwar era, many of the instruments advocated by the peace movement were created, even if the vision for peace was dismissed as hopelessly nave. <p> Today, we reap the benefits of the peace movement.

Further, the dominant patterns of conflict have changed : violence is more determined by non-state actors, globalized communications, commercial interests( licit or illicit), and sub-national disputes, proving remarkably intractable to the tools of conflict resolution. <p> To respond to today 's conflicts, we not only need new instruments and need a new vision of peace. <p> If you enjoyed this article, please consider sharing it!
