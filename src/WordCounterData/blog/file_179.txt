5126041 <p> GLOBAL warming may be putting a freeze on Atlantic salmon sex. Fishing records from anglers on 59 Norwegian rivers show that more and more salmon are staying out at sea for two or more winters - instead of one - before migrating back upriver to mate.... Salmon need to eat enough in the autumn for their gonads to mature the following spring. Temperature-driven changes in the food web mean fish may lack food at this critical time, forcing them to fatten up for longer before reproducing. Vollestad says more time in predator-rich open waters may help explain their overall decline. On the upside, fish should be bigger when they swim upriver. <p> Record numbers of a once-waning population of sockeye salmon have been returning to the Northwest 's Columbia Basin this summer, with thousands more crossing the river 's dams in a single day than the total numbers seen in some previous years. <p> Since Bonneville Dam outside Portland was built in 1938, there have been plenty of times there were n't 38,000 sockeye salmon swimming over the fish ladders in a whole year. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another 41,000 swam over the dam on Wednesday -- a rate of nearly 30 a minute. That bought the total so far to 290,000. <p> The cumulative in-river fish count at Miles Lake, near the " Million Dollar Bridge " outside Cordova, stood at 469,895 as of Sunday. That is by far the most for that date in the past 34 years. Counting began on May 16.... This year 's giant number got a big boost from all-time daily highs reached last week. <p> " May 28, 29 and 30 were all records, " said Mark Somerville, Fish and Game 's area management biologist for sport fish based in Glennallen. " It was the highest we 've ever seen in a three-day count. " <p> The largest sockeye salmon run in nearly a century is breaking like a wave in British Columbia rivers, with as many as 25 million salmon estimated to be returning home to spawn. In comparison, last year 's run was just 1.7 million. <h> 1 comment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change. The main story is about Atlantic salmon, but the other articles are talking about NW( Pacific) salmon. All i know is i am in Denver wearing a sweater
