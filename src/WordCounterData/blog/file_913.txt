5200241 <h> James Nisbet Clark made it in the Big Apple <p> In 1950 with $200 and the GI Bill in his pocket, 24-year-old James Nisbet Clark jumped into a car with some buddies and made his pilgrimage to mecca, the performing arts version -- New York City. <p> Long before Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli sang about it, Clark had heard the conventional wisdom : If you can make it there, you 'll make it anywhere. <p> What followed was a 31-year career as an actor, producer, director, stage manager, lighting director and set designer, mostly off-Broadway, working on productions that launched or advanced the careers of Peter Falk, Van Heflin, Linda Darnell, Rita Moreno, Barbra Streisand and many others. <p> " It was sort of like a dream. I felt like I was living my destiny. New York was where I belonged, " muses Clark, who once again resides in Salinas, where, at 86, he 's writing a musical comedy. <p> Hoping for big break <p> " I always had reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that great part, get that big break, " he says. " It never quite happened, but I enjoyed enough success, got enough good notices, and was able to do enough things that I was able to keep working continuously for the entire time. I was always given reason to believe in myself, so I continued to work, and the theater gave me great happiness. " <p> He discovered the stage as a senior at Salinas High School, where a drama teacher named Harold Ulrisci produced about five plays each school year. After serving in the military <p> Advertisement <p> at the end of World War II, Clark accepted a scholarship to a Los Angeles art school. But he decided theater was his first love and returned home to attend Hartnell College, where Ulrisci had become head of the drama department. Then he went to San Jose State, where he learned theatrical design from J. Wendell Johnson. <p> His GI Bill benefits enabled him to enroll in New York 's top performing-arts school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Kramm, who that year wrote " The Shrike, " a play that won the Pulitzer Prize. <p> Kramm 's good fortune also was a stroke of luck for Clark, who was hired as an assistant stage manager and given a small part in a cast that starred Jose Ferrer in 161 performances on Broadway, and Van Heflin on a seven-month, post-Broadway national tour. <p> " One of my jobs every night was to make up Van Heflin 's bald spot, darken it with pencil, so it would n't be visible on stage, " he recalls. <p> Barbra Streisand <p> Clark was working as stage manager for a play called " The Purple Dust, " starring Peter Falk, in the summer of 1956, when he heard somebody pounding on the back door at the Cherry Lane Theater in Manhattan. <p> " I could hear a young girl asking our box office and business manager if they had any jobs for her at the theater, and I told them to ask her if she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She said, ' Yes, absolutely, ' and she swept that stage every day, religiously and did a great job every time. " <p> The teenager with the summer job was a high school senior-to-be named Barbra Streisand. Clark already had a star and an understudy, but when he heard the girl sing, he offered to rehearse her as a second understudy. <p> " I said, ' Barbra, you have such a lovely voice, ' and she said, ' I know, ' " he recounts. " She actually disdained her singing voice at the time because she felt it was a distraction from her main focus, which was to become an actress. " <p> Acting also was Clark 's first priority, but competition for roles was daunting, he says. <p> " There are 100 people who show up to audition for every available job in New York, " he says. " Of those 100, there are at least 10 who are very, very good. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant. The competition is very rough, and luck has a great deal to do with success. " <p> His ability to design sets, arrange lighting, manage a stage, and do virtually any other production job kept him out of the soup lines. Because of his versatility, he never lacked employment on the off-Broadway scene, and he loved the lifestyle. <p> ' It was magic ' <p> " For a young person, it was magic. The romance of the theater was very much there, " he says. " There was such excitement : the opportunity of work, the possibility of success. <p> " My favorite venue probably was The Gate Theater on Second Avenue and 10th Street, because that 's was where I first produced, directed and designed a show, and also the first place I became an understudy and ended up playing a role in the show. I also did a lot of work at The Village Gate, an off-Broadway theater and bar, which is still there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director for " Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, " which debuted in January 1968 at The Village Gate( starring Elly Stone and Mort Schuman) and ran for more than four years, and also for " Oh, Coward! "( 1972), which played for 294 performances at the New Theatre with a cast that included Barbara Cason, Jamie Ross and Roderick Cook. <p> He worked with Linda Darnell in a touring production of " Tea and Sympathy, " as well as Rita Moreno 's first Broadway show, " The Sign in Sidney Brustein 's Window "( 1964, Longacre Theatre). <p> He also had success in New York as a caricature artist, his cartoons gracing the walls of McGowan 's, an off-Broadway restaurant/bar. <p> " I returned to Salinas from 1981 when my mother was advancing in age and needed caretaking, " he says. " She had given me complete freedom of choice for 30 years, and I thought I owed it to her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since coming home, he 's been involved in various capacities with productions at the Western Stage and Pacific Repertory Theater and has performed one-man shows( Steinbeck readings and a production called ' Songs of Jacques Brel. ") <p> " I think creative people are like old soldiers : They never die, " Clark says with a laugh. " It 's very seldom that a theater person gives up
