5117641 <h> The amazing stories of the world 's most iconic cameras <p> Cameras are not just functioning things ; a few have also gained iconic -- even mythological -- status. This has been either because of those who used them, the historic events they captured, their giant technological leaps or simply downright beautiful design. Everyone will have an opinion about their favourite camera, but here 's the ones we think make the grade. <p> Bullet Proof... Literally <p> First introduced in 1959, the Nikon F was partially responsible for the all conquering rise of the SLR and featured elements that stayed with the Nikon brand for the next fifty years. It was legendary for its robustness and therefore unsurprisingly favoured by war photographers and photojournalists around the world. This particular F was also responsible for saving Don McCullin 's life. Whilst working in Cambodia in 1970, an AK47 round was deftly deflected away from McCullin 's head by the cameras body. <p> Now, Now, Now! <p> In a climate of instant gratification, the Polaroid no longer holds the capacity to amaze that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea : instant photographic records of the moment before the moment has even passed. The first Polaroid, Model 95, appeared in 1948. And just under twenty years later, in1965, the Model 20 Swinger, aimed purely at the domestic market, was launched. It remains one of the best selling cameras of all time. <p> Tripping all the Way to the Eighties <p> The Olympus Trip 35 was a ground-breaking point and shoot which sold over ten million units. Although aimed at the ' average user ' wanting decent holiday snaps,( hence the name Trip), it was a little camera that was capable of getting great results. Battery-less, thanks to a solar powered light meter, it was simple to use and small and tough enough to easily carry around. The Trip 35 set the bench mark for nearly twenty years -- before Olympus finally ceased production in 1984. <p> From Here to Eternity... <p> Nokia 's journey into the world of cameras started with the Nokia 7650 back in 2002. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues the ground breaking trend. The astonishing 41mp camera has grabbed all the headlines -- with both phone and camera geeks! Whichever way you look at it, this is a camera that has caused people to sit up and take notice and could genuinely spell the end of the point-and-shoot market. <p> Medium Format Perfection <p> Although Hasselblad began life in Sweden in 1841 it was n't until the 1960s that the company became a household name amongst the world 's top photographers. Having gained a reputation for their aerial cameras with the Swedish Air Force during WWII, it was to Hasselblad that NASA turned when they needed cameras aboard their 1962 space flights. Funding from NASA was then directly responsible for the world 's first motor-drive on a stills camera. And as if that was n't glamorous enough, the top studio photographers of the 60s soon made the Hasselblad their camera of choice. <p> The Red Dot <p> No list of iconic cameras is complete without a Leica. In 1925 the Leica I began the 35mm revolution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photojournalism. Above is the classic M3, which was first introduced in 1954. The list of Leica users is almost a who 's who of 20 th century photography : Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, W Eugene Smith, Garry Winogrand, Philip Jones Griffiths, Leonard Freed... Quite simply legendary. <p> That 's our amazing selection of iconic cameras, but what about yours? We 'd love to know if you think there are others that deserve a place in our hall of fame. <h> Comments <p> The cameras are amazing, but what folks can do with a cell phone camera blows me away! <p> http : **26;13177;TOOLONG pemko <p> Take the sony cameras with first back illuminated sensor <p> http : **29;13205;TOOLONG Sui <p> I 've used my grandpa Leica :) great experience :) <p> http : **32;13236;TOOLONG Mark Reynolds <p> Only surprised that the Brownie was n't included in this lineup <p> http : **35;13270;TOOLONG Adam Monaghan <p> Watch this space!!! :) <p> Erkki Ruohtula <p> Or its successor the Kodak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new film totally foolproof and simple, and reduced the dreaded consequences of accidentally opening the back of a camera before rewinding the film to just one spoiled frame. <p> http : //bajabybus.com/ Baja By Bus <p> Surely it 's what you do with it that counts? ; -) <p> http : **35;13307;TOOLONG Adam Monaghan <p> THAT is a very interesting point!!!!! I could ramble on about exactly that all day. :) Which would bore you all to tears!!! :) <p> http : //twitter.com/djduncan David Duncan <p> Roliflex was iconic with the press for many years <p> http : **28;13344;TOOLONG Mike Sharadin <p> For me the Polaroid was my first and simple. A precursor to the digital age jet point and shoot and enjoy <p> http : **25;13374;TOOLONG Trameka Peterson <p> I loved the Polaroid camera. The pictures hold up very well in photo albums too. <p> PmD <p> In general any camera gives decent result as long as the subject has a good lighting and the fotographer knows what she/he is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds me that I wish I was a better photographer. I do all right with my Digital Rebel, but I really get to do it the lazy way because I no longer have to worry about film. I think if I 'd learned more of the practical skills back when I had a film camera I 'd be much better today. It 's amazing to me that combat photographers have been able to get some of the shots I 've seen over the years. I 'm happy when I pull out the camera in time to get a seagull flapping overhead, but war? Incredible. <p> david olivencia <p> camera technology continues to improve <p> gadgety <p> I did n't know I had an iconic camera in my Trip35 although I have to say it did shoot some amazing pics. Nice article. <p> http : **35;13401;TOOLONG Adam Monaghan <p> Glad to hear it! It was my first camera and it really
