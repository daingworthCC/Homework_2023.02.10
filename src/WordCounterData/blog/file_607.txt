They showed this video that started with the whole planet, hanging in the inky void of space, and zoomed in to Europe, then to the UK, then to London, then to University College London itself.

But last week, I was testing an algorithm that classified areas by basic land use types, based only on some employment and population information. And there were some areas that were n't coming out correctly ; places I 'd seen and thought were retail that were being coded as industrial. So I add the Google Maps Hybrid layer behind my shapefile ; it 's got the airphoto and the business names. I open up Streetview in the other monitor ; it 's got the business types listed as well. In just a few minutes, the problems are sorted out and the algorithm is doing the right thing again. <p> That to me is the magical part ; in a few seconds, I can see anywhere on the planet with more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold war.

It can be easy to assume that maps are objective : that the world is out there, and that a good map is one that represents it accurately. But that 's not true. Any square mile of the planet can be described in an infinite number of ways : in terms of its natural features, its weather, its socio-economic profile, or what you can buy in the shops there. Traditionally, the interests reflected in maps have been those of states and their armies, because they were the ones who did the mapmaking, and the primary use of many such maps was military.( If you had the better maps, you stood a good chance of winning the battle. The Ordnance Survey 's logo still includes a visual reference to the 18th-century War Department.) Now, the power is shifting. " Every map, " the cartography curator Lucy Fellowes once said, " is someone 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way.

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. You do n't have to be a libertarian to think seeing governments as benign stewards of mapmaking as suspect. All input you receive is being mediated. <p> We would all like to be under the auspices of angels, totally removed from the baser motivations. But we are n't, and the best we can do is be observant of these motivations, both government and private.

You already have my fiscal profile. You know everything I 've purchased since cash registers went online, my water and electricity usage, and probably even how many keystrokes I 've generated since 1995. My car emails me to let me know that it 's time for an oil change, that the tires on the left side are a bit low, that my average speed is 37mph and I get almost 30 miles per gallon.

Say Google wants a bill passed and it decides it wants a certain person elected. What 's to stop it from looking at every search their opponents have made? Every place they have looked for directions to? And as others above have mentioned, when technology like this it 's pretty naive to think governments themselves will not be all over it. <p> Ultimately things like Google Maps are hugely beneficial to society and, though they already run largely on public infrastructure( GPS), it 's somewhat odd that private companies are providing public goods, but the incentives are there( or at least, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by traditional economic incentives in the way we tend to think about them).
