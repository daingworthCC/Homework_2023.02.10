It 's not something I intend to do. It 's not something that motivates me, if just because there are other athletes on my team in his weight group, like Minotouro, Maldonado, Feijao, Caldeirao. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title. But people are talking about it so much and I 'm an employee of the UFC, " said the Spider. <p> " Of course, I could be saying I do n't want to. But what if he accepts the money Dana will give him to fight? It 'll be tough not to take. It 's not money that motivates me to fight. I fight because I like it. So, I du n no. I would n't want to. But if it 's going to happen, it would have to be at a pre-arranged catch weight. It would n't be for his belt. And I already have mine and do n't want a title I 'll have to give up, " he said. <p> Anderson Silva and Jon Jones are going through similar moments in their respective divisions. They each have a handful of rivals gunning for their belts but not one clear-cut challenger to the title. But while the inter-champion superfight does n't look likely to leave the paper anytime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimate Fighter commitments out of the way, UFC management and fans alike can at least dream of the fight everyone wants to see -- and the one match-up most likely to break pay-per-view records. <p> What do you think, gentle reader ; is there another UFC superfight you 'd rather see than this one? <p> Share this <h> 2 Responses to " Anderson agrees to face Jon Jones : "
