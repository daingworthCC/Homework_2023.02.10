5185741 <h> The Heart 's History -- Lewis DeSimone( Lethe Press) <p> Some books are loud and abrasive, demanding your attention as they exhaust it. Others work their charms with subtlety and nuance, finishing just as memorably -- if not more so -- than those that scream their premises. Lewis DeSimone proves himself a master of the quiet approach with his latest release, The Heart 's History. <p> Ostensibly, this is the story of Edward and his younger lover Robert and how a group of Edward 's long-time friends cope with his illness and death from AIDS, seeking to understand a multi-faceted man who has only shown parts of himself. In a larger sense, The Heart 's History takes on the more universal topics of settling down, settling in, the assimilation of our culture into straight society, and aging gracefully. Or not. <p> Complex yet engaging, this story is not plot-driven. Yes, things happen and there is a story arc. However, suspense is not the reason these pages seem to turn themselves. The characters are so real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening chapter as they gather at a Provincetown beachside home, they already seem like old friends. DeSimone accomplishes this with his uncanny gift for dialogue that sounds spoken instead of written and an unerring eye for detail. By the time you hit page 32, you already care about these people -- a much more important propellant than plot. <p> One of those people, Harlan, really stands out. Harlan is the unrepentant slut of the bunch -- a fiercely independent man with a healthy disdain of straight culture, romance and couplehood. He appreciates the relationship Edward has with Robert but simply can not see himself involved in anything remotely similar. When Sam comes into his life, he acknowledges the importance of such deep connections but is unable to force himself to forge that bond. <p> The relationship between Edward and Robert is also important as it frames the story. We are introduced to Robert in the first chapter, as are the other friends. Younger than the rest, Robert feels left out and odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own friendships within Edward 's crowd -- especially with Kyle, Edward 's closest friend and the one who 's always had a secret crush on Edward. Another pairing worth mentioning is Edward 's friend Greg and Greg 's boyfriend( and later, husband) Victor. Greg has been out for years, but Victor is only recently out, having been married for a number of years. Victor 's discomfort at being with obviously gay men is delicious, especially when he 's being skewered by Harlan, and their exchanges provide for some of the funniest and most telling dialogue in the book. <p> But anything I can say about The Heart 's History will only pale in comparison to the work itself. Genuine, heartfelt and true, this is a beautiful
