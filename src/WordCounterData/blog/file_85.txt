5116541 <p> If you 're planning on grilling this Labor Day weekend, we have a safe and easy way to check the propane level in the tank of your gas grill -- all it takes is a cup of water. <p> To check the level of gas in your propane tank, bring a cup of water to a boil and pour it over the side of the tank. Now feel the tank and look for the point where the tank goes from feeling hot( empty) to cool( filled with propane). That 's your propane level. So simple! <p> I always have a tank on backup. When one runs out I have another one ready to go and then I have a few weeks to fill the other. Since the cost of the tanks it 's anything insane it worth not being SOL before dinner/a party or whatever. I would although like to give this a try because I once had an issue with my grill only to find out the gas was out.... doh
