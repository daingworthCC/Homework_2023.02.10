5160041 <p> He 's not talking about the fact that ChemRefer is disappearing, quite the contrary. he is talking about how the combination of ChemRefer/ChemSpider is powering ahead with our indexing of Open Access articles and the new 10s of 1000s of articles added to ChemSpider text-searching capabilities so far, and the many more coming soon. <p> I guess now we have to consider that " ChemSpider could disappear tomorrow " too. I hope we disappear in the SAME way! By that I mean I hope that some organization sees the value of what we are doing and will want to collaborate with us in order to make an even bigger impact. One thing about what we are doing, as I commented during my presentation at the Whitney Symposium at GE is " We are upsetting a lot of people -- evangelists, cheminformatics system vendors, publishers, data content providers ". This is NOT intentional but what we are doing is disruptive, we understand. We have n't focused on talking about what 's possible but getting on with doing it, sometimes with warts and all. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat but based on direct feedback some do. Its a shame. We have a lot of " birthmarks " on us at present... We are upsetting a lot of people <p> Any time you have a disruptive technology like this you 're going to ruffle some feathers. What is being done with Chemspider is still a boon to open science, no matter what the detractors say. The important thing is to keep going on as strong as we have been doing so that we contribute more to open science. Let the detractors argue what they want, we should be too busy
