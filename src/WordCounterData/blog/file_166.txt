5124741 <h> Review of : The Rivalry <p> I was actually assigned the first draft of The Rivalry, but did n't get to it before it was deleted, so I was happy to get the second draft. It was a good read, and has potential to be a good traditional light hearted RomCom. <p> One of the reasons I was interested was I am a huge Football fan. Unfortunately I mostly watch NFL, but I do keep track of College Football and go to a few Hawaii games now and then. I understand rivalries and the way team allegiance is passed on from generation to generation. <p> Dialogue was clearly the strength of the script, and considering how dialogue driven RomComs are, that is a big plus. About the only thing I could see that needed improving was the tightening of a few lines to strengthen their comedic punch : <p> Examples : P19 " Totally. I wan na have tons of his babies.( cut) It? s a pretty common name, Harris.( cut) " <p> P28 Hi. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan Wolverines. Can you help me find my ass?( cut) I hired a detective, but he hasn? t gotten back to me.( cut) " <p> The characters were okay. I felt they were a little bland and you missed a bunch of opportunities to create some real eccentric characters with Kayla and Jay 's parents( more on this later). I actually began to get a little annoyed with Kayla 's overzealous love for Ohio St. I understand she " bleeds red "( good joke, BTW) but she was pushing her religion way too hard. I would have dumped her if I were Jay. <p> Most of my concerns were with the story. The premise is great. I honestly do n't know why someone has n't done this already. I think it reeks of comedic potential because of how passionate some people and families are about their sports teams. <p> Your basic plot is good, and there are some real highlights, particularly Kayla 's mom watching the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting bland food, and the ultimate football finale. The problems I had were with the story as a whole. After the initial debate on whether Kayla should date a football player from a rival school, there basically is n't a whole lot of conflict other than Kayla 's obsession with Ohio State above all else. Like I mentioned in the character section, this made her character a little too unbelievable for me. I 've seen some obsessed fans, but never to the point to where Kayla was. The surprising thing is this would have worked perfectly for both Kayla 's parents and Jay 's parents. You could really go for a Romeo and Juliet-esq type story if you wanted to go in that direction. <p> I guess it all boils down to the relative lack of conflict and consequences to their " forbidden relationship ". The majority of the second act consisted of conflict that was self-inflicted by Kayla 's Ohio State obsession. The rest of the conflict happened behind the scenes, Like when jay tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her, I wanted to see that happen instead of hearing about it. You finally got others involved closer to the end of the script. I enjoyed the cheerleaders taking a stand to Lisa and defending Kayla, which was a really cool moment. I also enjoyed the big game, but( you knew there was a " but " coming, lol) I think Kayla needs something to truly test her loyalty to Jay. I don ; t know exactly what, and I truly do love the sudden cheering for the other team moment. I just think there was a smidge bit more you could do to build up the tension of that critical moment. <p> Finally, to end this on a positive note, I really enjoyed your writing style. very smooth, and easy to read. I hope to read more of your scripts in the future. <p> A few notes : P56 " Ohio State sucks ". Funny! <p> P85 " Stop eating all my Ramen? ". Funny! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting team 's band does n't do a halftime show on the opponents field. I 've seen visiting cheerleaders, but think about it. Why would the home team want to showcase the opponent 's school? <h> Other Reviews by iceeis 383 <p> I read an earlier version of this script a few months ago. It is certainly much improved from that draft. A lot of the situations seem a bit more natural, and you? re doing a better job of explaining why Aaron continues to cross-dress.

I read an earlier version of this script a few months ago. It is certainly much improved from that draft. A lot of the situations seem a bit more natural, and you? re doing a better job of explaining why Aaron continues to cross-dress. That said, I still have a few concerns, many of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good for a romantic comedy. Sure, there has been cross dressing movies before, but this one tries to use the premise as a positive goal of understanding women, not to fool others. <p> Dialogue was good as well. There are still a few long winded speeches, but it? s been toned down from the previous version. <p> The story tended to, er, drag, in the middle. I found the numerous scenes in the ladies clothing store kind of boring. I? d like to see more creative/visual ways for Aaron/Erin to discover things about women instead of spending the whole time chatting with them. Things like Candy hooking up with Shane. You showed Shane being a jerk and Candy falling for him. I think the other reason was 120 pages is too long for a comedy. <p> I did enjoy the ending more. I don? t think the final Aaron/Megan confrontation is as powerful/explosive as it needs to be, but I was satisfied with Aaron hitting it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns I had were the same as the last version : <p> We need to see Aaron more as himself in the beginning and ease into? Erin?. Then as the story progresses, we see more of Erin and less of Aaron. You need to do this because it sets up the differences between the two, and thus comedy ensues. In my opinion, Aaron spends way too much time as Erin, and honestly doesn? t seem to act any different while disguised as her. <p> I still don? t see a compelling reason for Aaron to cross dress in the first place. He already seemed kind of effeminate to begin with, and already had the? best friend? symptom. He already was a confidant with girls, it didn? t seem like he needed to disguise himself to hear the same confessions. Basically, he was the same guy, just with a wig. Most of the information he obtained was stuff he could have easily observed on his own. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was basically Aaron. It made no sense for Aaron to be trying to raise Cole? s confidence and try to reward him for being nice to women when Aaron himself hadn? t cracked the code yet. Basically it was the blind leading the blind? If you insist on keeping him, find a better way for Aaron to help him out. <p> It seemed like everyone that found out about Aaron/Erin seemed to take it rather well. I can? t believe Shane didn? t freak out, let alone allow his friend to continue his date with Erin. <p> Finally, as before, I had a tough time figuring out if Aaron was being/speaking as Erin. I still suggest you use the slug? AARON? when he is a man and? ERIN? while as a woman. <p> All in all, you are moving the right direction. I see significant improvement in this script, so the hard work is beginning to pay off. read <p> Wow, I really don? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fascinated by this script, the other half is utterly confused.

Part of me is fascinated by this script, the other half is utterly confused. <p> I loved the setting. It reminded me of the city of Rapture from the Bioshock games. A unique society slowly driven mad by the same thing that makes them unique. More importantly, the concept of the purple gas and the people choosing to live there made some of the craziness of the story less, er, crazy. <p> You are a good writer and extremely imaginative. I felt you had full control through this house of mirrors, which was good thing. Dialogue was well done. Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I loved the various scenarios about the theory of who placed the gas in the first place, each ending with? Fire?. <p> One thing that must be done : Formatting. I was very confused as this script seemed to move effortlessly back in forth between reality, flashbacks, and( maybe) fantasy. I was unsure when Rodger and Will were seemingly dead, yet still talking, if they were really still alive, or were figments of Jules( or someone else? s) imagination. Later it? s revealed that Rodger isn? t dead( I think), but then I wonder how he could have sustained all that damage, and yet not be dead. <p> Again, the way Orange Island was presented made the story more believable. I slowly settled into the way everything worked in the story. One thing I didn? t understand was if it was so easy to kill someone by souplining them, why even go through the elaborate scheme to set up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just toss Rodger outside? Or better yet, gas him in his own home to make the yellow gas seem ineffective, thus accomplishing their goal? <p> The ending, while funny and unexpected pushed this script( which already walked a fine line of the absurd) over the edge. I would have bought the rabbit conspiracy, but the double conspiracy with Casabianca( and his masks) and final confrontation between a suddenly alive Rodger and Jules would have been well past the point when the General in Monty Python would have ended the movie for being? too silly?. Maybe if you moved Updike? s reveal until after Rodger is dead( again). I just feel you had control of the madness that was your script until the end where it quit being clever, and just became weird. <p> Anyway, critiquing this and offering story suggestions is like trying to make a Picasso look like a Norma Rockwell. It? s not what you intended and it would ruin the insanely fascinating script I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and someone may take a chance on this. read <p> I have to be honest. Aimless left me very confused. Maybe it was just me, maybe it would play better on screen, but I understood very little of what was going on. Actually, I understood a lot of what was going on, but I didn? t understand why.

Maybe it was just me, maybe it would play better on screen, but I understood very little of what was going on. Actually, I understood a lot of what was going on, but I didn? t understand why. <p> The characters for the most part were good. Melvin at times was very creepy, and I could feel Elaine? s desire to help him out. The dialogue was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story at times, and Chad? s was on-the-nose more often than not. <p> I liked the earmuffs as a tool to keep the voices out. <p> Concerns : <p> I had a very tough time following this script. It was very confusing to me, and even more so when I tried to make sense of it for this review. <p> A lot of things happen in the script that I had to question if they needed to happen, or why they were necessary. Basically it reads like it is much more complicated than it needs to be, and not all of them pay off sufficiently. <p> I didn? t see why Elaine and Melvin were related. Other than provide a way for Elaine to find her father, it adds nothing. There was no pay off to this connection. Elaine was already deeply involved in Melvin? s life as his psychiatrist, this was an unnecessary complication. Elaine could have easily found her father through other means. <p> I didn? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherent he peed himself, yet could switch it off whenever he wanted to talk to Elaine. If Elaine was Melvin? s Psychiatrist, why did his mother take him to another one for the pills, then go back to Elaine? I don? t think another psychiatrist would treat someone else? s patient. <p> Melinda needs to be introduced earlier. <p> Chad could probably be cut. He? s frustratingly unsympathetic to Elaine and I didn? t want him to come back. <p> The ending didn? t make sense based on the direction of the rest of the story. The cult was hinted at, but I didn? t make the connection between Elaine and Melvin? s therapy and the discovery of the cult. What I gathered from their conversations, Melvin basically saw that evil has a physical form, yet most of us ignore it out of ignorance. I dig that, but the cult appearing close to the end of the story trying to expose the demons to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost nothing to do with the first 90 pages of the script. <p> I didn? t understand what Phil had to do with Elaine regarding the ending. The only reason they confronted each other is she figured out he was the one who blew up the stage, and she was only there out of coincidence. Unless I missed something and Phil wanted her there for some reason( why I don? t know). I? m also not sure if Phil was trying to keep Elaine away from Melvin. If he was, I didn? t understand why. So what if she knows that demons are? real?? A lot of people already think they are real, and society still hums along. <p> Despite all this, this still is n't a bad script by any means. You are a good writer. I think this is a perfect example of what Triggerstreet has to offer us all. Things that may make perfect sense to the writer might not make sense to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get
