5196241 <h> Want to be an Extra in Seattle Opera 's Fidelio? Open Auditions are Saturday <h> September 11th, 2012 by Laura <p> Interested in participating in Seattle Opera 's upcoming production of Beethoven 's only opera, Fidelio? Seattle Opera is looking for " dozens of extras to crowd the stage " during the final scene. The extra roles are volunteer, non-singing, non-speaking roles -- so no worries if you do n't have the pipes for opera, this is an opportunity for all! <p> Fidelio is the story of a man wrongly imprisoned for his political beliefs and during the final scene, prisoners and townspeople( this is where the extras get their 15 minutes of fame) celebrate the downfall of a tyrant, the establishment of justice, and the strength of a humble person empowered by love. <p> Seattle Opera is looking for people of all ages and walks of life, and since the production takes place in the present day
