5110441 <h> Ag Com farm tour- guess how much of the economic pie farming occupies? <p> On Tuesday, July 31, I embarked on a bus tour of six farms in Maine, as the guest of the Agricultural Council of Maine. I was in the company of many legislative candidates and representatives from Maine 's farming interests. We visited Belanger 's Farm near Lewiston/Auburn, went to Nezinscott Farm for lunch- ate amazing pizza and toured the biodynamic gardens, and went to Moark LLC, which is the former DeCosta Egg Factory, Conant Acres, Crane 's Farm... Heard about organic and not organic farming, erosion control, aquaculture, the dairy industry in Maine, Ricker Hill Orchards for the best dinner made of local Maine ingredients ever, with the best view in Maine, simply a superb day. <p> So go ahead and guess the answer to the question. I will tell you that Maine has 306 dairy farms, that 's just dairy farms, which provide over 1300 direct jobs and over 4000 total jobs, and this industry generates 570 million dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy component. <p> The answer? One Billion Dollars. Maine produces more food for human consumption than any other New England state except for Vermont. Agriculture is second to forestry in terms of land use in the state, and Maine farmers own nearly 1.34 million acres of land, or 7% of the total land base
