5153541 <h> It could have been me <p> I have n't read the bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. For those who have been living under a rock, covering their ears and la-la-la-ing to themselves, it 's part of the latest erotic fiction craze. Even in a terrible economy, the popularity of romance novels -- including erotic fiction -- is on the rise. Especially with e-readers. Nobody has to know you 're reading those books. Genius. <p> Author E.L. James started dabbling in erotica when she was writing Twilight fan fiction.( Even though I 'm a Twilight fan, I never got into the fan fiction. I must have been with you, under that rock.) Fifty Shades of Grey started out as a lengthy piece of fan fiction that became very popular very fast. It is apparently much more racy than your average romance novel, but people must really like it because it has now been published in more than 37 countries. There is a film adaptation already in the works and James has secured a lucrative deal to write even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " 100 Most Influential People in the World ". <p> -- <p> When I was in the seventh grade, I was going though that pre-teen phase of just wanting to blend in. Having moved to the DC area, I was dealing with living off a military base for the first time in years and going to my first non-Department of Defense school. I was struggling with being the new kid among kids who had grown up together. I also went to middle school orientation with green teeth after a piece of gum my mom gave me discolored my teeth.( My older sister when to her high school orientation with the same green hue across her chompers. Things were not going well for us.) <p> I loved to write and I 'd spend hours writing bits and pieces of a novel. I never usually shared my writing, but my parents knew, based on my previous school records, that I would excel in an advanced English class. I did not want to be pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply exist somewhere in the background. I did not want attention or special treatment. I wanted to wear Doc Martens and my dad 's old army field jacket and sit in the back of the class, brooding. <p> But my mom would not let me. <p> Unbeknownst to me, my mom was in the process of making a case for me switching classes. She went into my room while I was out and gathered writing samples to take to the administrators at my school. <p> While she was sifting through my things, she came across some of my... how should I put this? My more exploratory writing samples. A love scene here and there. Sex scenes inspired by movies I had seen " by mistake " and a few chapters I had managed to read from a trashy romance novel I found in the guest bedroom at my grandma 's house. There were lots of references to racing hearts and broad shoulders and tight pants. <p> Before the birds and the bees talk, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time. And even though at 13 I had recently been told that sex was more than rolling around( and later I 'd learn that you do n't have to roll around at all), I still did not quite get how it all worked. Then I read a few pages of this romance novel and it was AWESOME and also what the heck does that part mean and ewww, because boys are gross. It was confusing more than anything. <p> Understandably, I stole the book for research purposes. <p> -- <p> I had no idea what I was writing, but even back then, I knew love scenes would always be appealing to the reader. I have to hand it to myself. For a 13 year old with absolutely no experience in this department, I was pretty damn good at writing about it. <p> It was not pretty when I came home from school that day. It 's actually something I 've blocked out of my mind until now. Now, it 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PLEASE DO N'T TELL DAD! <p> My mom was teary and clearly disappointed. She sat me down and took my hands in hers. She explained what she had found and how upsetting it was to read. <p> Then she said, " God gave you this wonderful writing talent... you should use it for only good things. " <p> Not only was my mom disappointed, but God was too! <p> The school moved me into an advanced English class. <p> I never wrote another " sexy " scene. <p> -- <p> Now that I 'm an adult, I think a case can be made for saucy love scenes being very good things. Am I right? Imagine where I 'd be now if I had continued that novel. Fifty Shades of Grey... pfft. It could have been me. <p> I 'm surprised your mother freaked out so much. I 'm not sure why, though. It seems only natural that a 13 year old would be curious about the topic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how your daughter decided to pursue it? No? I 'll wait until Mister is writing erotica and see how I feel about it then, I guess. <p> I have n't read 50 Shades of Grey either because I 've heard it 's so poorly written. Given that it came from Twilight Fan Fiction, this should n't be a surprise.( And you know I have actually read Twilight fan fiction in the past. Ugh.) I 'm going to hold out for your erotica. <p> Great post! It could have been you. It 's funny, I did read the 50 Shades trilogy and I did n't see what the whole fuss was about it being so racy. I liked the love story part, but if you want racy sex scenes, read the Sleeping Beauty trilogy that Anne Rice wrote under a pen name. Whoa! Some parts
