5134241 <h> Some real Shock and Awe : Racially profiled and cuffed in Detroit <p> Silly me. I thought flying on 9/11 would be easy. I figured most people would choose not to fly that day so lines would be short, planes would be lightly filled and though security might be ratcheted up, we 'd all feel safer knowing we had come a long way since that dreadful Tuesday morning 10 years ago. <p> My flight from Denver landed in Detroit on time. I sent a text message to my husband to let him know we had landed and I would be home by dinner. The plane stopped on the tarmac, seemingly waiting to have the gate cleared. We waited. I played on my phone, checking Facebook, scrolling through my Twitter feed. After a while of sitting there, I decided to call my husband to tell him the plane was being delayed and I would call him when I got off the plane. <p> Just as I hung up the phone, the captain came over the loudspeaker and announced that the airport authorities wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport. Must be a blocked gate or something, I thought. But then he said : Everyone remain in your seats or there will be consequences. Sounded serious. I looked out the window and saw a squadron of police cars following the plane, lights flashing. I turned to my neighbor, who happened to be an Indian man, in wonderment. What is going on? Others on the plane were remarking at the police as well. Getting a little uneasy, I decided the best thing for me to do was to tweet about the experience. If the plane was going to blow up, at least there 'd be some record on my part. <p> Stuck on a plane at Detroit airport... cops everywhere <p> Soon the plane was stopping in some remote part of the airport, far from any buildings, and out the window I see more police cars coming to surround the plane. Maybe there 's a fugitive on the plane, I say to my neighbor, who is also texting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asks me to take a few, as I have a better angle from my window seat. A few dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers are huddled off the side of the plane. I do n't see any guns, and it is n't clear what 's going on. <p> So I continued to tweet : <p> A little concerned about this situation. Plane moved away from terminal surrounded by cops. Crew is mum. Passengers ca n't get up. <p> Then what looked like the bomb squad pulled up. Two police vans and a police communication center bus parked off the road. I started to get nervous and rethink my decision to fly on 9/11. <p> Cops in uniform and plainclothes in a huddle in rear of plane. <p> We had been waiting on the plane for a half hour. I had to pee. I wanted to get home and see my family. And I wanted someone to tell us what was going on. In the distance, a van with stairs came closer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get off the plane and get shuttled back to the terminal. I would still be able to make it home for dinner. Others on the plane also seemed happy to see those stairs coming our way. <p> I see stairs coming our way... yay! <p> Before I knew it, about 10 cops, some in what looked like military fatigues, were running toward the plane carrying the biggest machine guns I have ever seen -- bigger than what the guards carry at French train stations. <p> My last tweet : <p> Majorly armed cops coming aboard <p> Someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us, heads down. The cops ran down the aisle, stopped at my row and yelled at the three of us to get up. " Can I bring my phone? " I asked, of course. What a cliffhanger for my Twitter followers! No, one of the cops said, grabbing my arm a little harder than I would have liked. He slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane. The three of us, two Indian men living in the Detroit metro area, and me, a half-Arab, half-Jewish housewife living in suburban Ohio, were being detained. <p> The cops brought us to a parked squad car next to the plane, had us spread our legs and arms. Mine asked me if I was wearing any explosives. " No, " I said, holding my tongue to not let out a snarky response. I was n't sure what I could and could not say, and all that came out was " What 's going on? " <p> No one would answer me. They put me in the back of the car. It 's a plastic seat, for all you out there who have never been tossed into the back of a police car. It 's hard, it 's hot, and it 's humiliating. The Indian man who had sat next to me on the plane was already in the backseat. I turned to him, shocked, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him if he knew the other man that had been in our row, and he said he had just met him. I said, it 's because of what we look like. They 're doing this because of what we look like. And I could n't believe that I was being arrested and taken away. <p> When the Patriot Act was passed after 9/11 and Arabs and Arab-looking people were being harassed all over the country, my Saudi Arabian dad became nervous. A bit of a conspiracy theorist at heart, he knew the government was watching him and at any time could come and take him away. It was happening all over. Men were being taken on suspicion of terrorist activities and held and questioned -- sometimes abused -- for long periods of time. Our country had a civil rights issue on its hands. And, in the name of patriotism we lost a lot of our liberty, especially those who look like me. <p> I never had any run-ins with the law. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how my appearance would affect my travel plans, I never had any concrete reason to think I would be targeted. I passed through security without excessive searching( except that one time they thought they saw a pocket knife in my husband 's backpack, which they could n't find anyway even though it was there). Because I am my father 's daughter I am aware of the possibility of anti-Arab and anti-Semitic sentiments that have increased dramatically, but luckily no members of my family nor myself have had to endure what so many others have gone through in this country and throughout the world. As Americans we are scared and horrified by acts of terror. But I am not sure that what we are doing to dissuade and protect are working. <p> We arrived at an offsite building and remained in the squad car for a few minutes. The Indian man was taken out of the car first, and an officer stood at the door to make sure I did n't go anywhere. I asked him several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It was like I was invisible. I felt so helpless and shocked. I was being treated like a criminal. <p> Then it was my turn. I got out of the car and was led, still cuffed, to a cell. " Are you serious? " I asked the officer, and he said yes. The heavy metal door was shut and locked behind me. Again, I asked what was going on and why was I here. Finally he said, they will let you know later. They are going to ask you some questions. <p> I sat down on the metal cot that hung off the wall. It had a thin, green vinyl mattress -- mattress is a generous term -- that offered no comfort. It was about a 6-by-10 cell, the concrete walls were painted a light yellow but were streaked with black dirt. The floor was some sort of stainless steel, and a stainless steel toilet that has probably never seen the good side of a scrubbing brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I could. Near the ceiling above the toilet there was a video camera. <p> A plainclothes officer stood came to my door and asked me if I spoke English. Something in me snapped at that question. Of course I spoke English I 'm an American citizen, you asshole! Well, I left the expletive out. " Ok, " he said and stood watch outside my door saying he wanted to make sure I did n't " flush anything. " He also would n't tell me what was going on. <p> As I sat and waited, quietly contemplating my situation, the other Indian man was getting questioned in the main room outside. I could n't see what was going on, but I could hear a bit. They asked him where he was from, did he have any family, where were his shoes. He talked quietly and agreeably. I wondered if he was as incensed as I was or if he had entered this country expecting harassment from the American authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard an officer tell him to remove his clothes. He was going to be searched. I could not fully grasp what was happening. I stared at the yellow walls and listened to a few officers talk about the overtime they were racking up, and I decided that I hated country music. I hated speedboats and shitty beer in coozies and fat bellies and rednecks. I thought about Abu Ghraib and the horror to which those prisoners were exposed. I thought about my dad and his prescience. I was glad he was n't alive to know about what was happening to me. I thought about my kids, and what would have happened if they had been there when I got taken away. I contemplated never flying again. I thought about the incredible waste of taxpayer dollars in conducting an operation like this. I wondered what my rights were, if I had any at all. Mostly, I could not believe I was sitting in some jail cell in some cold, undisclosed building surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss my impending strip search. They needed to bring in a female officer. At least they were following protocol, or something to that nature. Still, could this really be happening? <p> Eventually a female uniformed officer came in. She looked like a fat Jada Pinkett Smith, and in a kind but firm voice explained what was going to happen. I was to stand, face the wall in a position so the camera above the toilet could n't see, and take off my clothes. I complied. She commented on my tattoo, saying, " Oh you have one of those things -- good and evil, right? " <p> " Yin and yang. Balance, " I said, grabbing my clothes to redress. <p> " You understand why we have to do this, right? It 's for our own protection, " she told me. <p> Because I am so violent. And pulling me off an airplane, handcuffing me and patting me down against a squad car did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure all my orifices were free and clear. <p> She apologized for having to do the strip search, and I asked her to tell me what was going on. She said she did n't know but someone would come and talk to me. She put my handcuffs back on and left. The other officer stood guard outside. I told him I needed to call my husband. He said I could use the phone later. <p> As I sat in my cell trying not to think about my full bladder, they brought another man in. I wondered if he had been on the plane as well. Were they going to bring everyone in or had they just singled us out? He spoke belligerently, and I could n't understand much of what he was saying. But I did hear two officers talking about the man who stole a $3,000 watch at the security checkpoint. Now there 's a real crime. What was I doing here? <p> I had no idea how much time had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweet on the plane. I could n't tell if it was day or night. I was tired, confused, angry and bored. I wanted my phone. I wanted to call my husband so he could come to Detroit and rescue me. I wanted to update my status so my friends were n't freaking out. Did I also want a lawyer? <p> Another female officer, this one in jeans and a t-shirt came to visit me. She introduced herself as an agent -- Homeland Security. She removed my handcuffs and had me follow her to a different room down a long hall and through a few doors. As we walked, I got a glimpse of the watch-stealer, a chubby middle-aged white guy with a buzz cut. He did n't look too different from some of the officers. <p> She led me to a small, white room where a man who introduced himself as an FBI agent was waiting for me. I sat on one of three chairs at a small metal table, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both offered me their badges for inspection, not that I would have known the difference, but they were calm and not pushy. I appreciated that. The male agent proceeded to ask me a series of questions about where I had been, where I was going, about my family, if I had noticed any suspicious behavior on the plane. The other agent took notes while I talked. They asked if I knew the two men sitting next to me, and if I noticed them getting up during the flight or doing anything I would consider suspicious. <p> I told them no, and could n't remember how many times the men had gotten up, though I was sure they had both gone to the bathroom in succession at some point during the flight. <p> They had done some background check on me already because they knew I had been to Venezuela in 2001. They asked about my brother and sister and asked about my foreign travel. They asked what I did during the flight. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read, slept and played on my phone( in airplane mode, do n't worry). They asked about my education and wanted my address, Social Security, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much my whole life story. <p> Again, I asked what was going on, and the man said judging from their line of questioning that I could probably guess, but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity. What is the likelihood that two Indian men who did n't know each other and a dark-skinned woman of Arab/Jewish heritage would be on the same flight from Denver to Detroit? Was that suspicion enough? Even considering that we did n't say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane? Perhaps it was two Indian man going to the bathroom in succession? <p> He warned me that the last time an incident like this happened back in December, they had to interview everyone on the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It was going to be a long haul. <p> They asked me if I wanted to add anything that they had n't asked. I said no. Then they asked if I needed anything. I said I needed a real bathroom, and the female officer, saying she did n't blame me, offered to take me to the officers ' bathroom. I must have peed straight for five minutes. <p> She walked me back to my cell, telling me it was for my own protection as they had brought in the rest of the passengers for questioning. They would fetch my stuff from the plane and allow me to call my husband. My cell had been occupied by the Indian man I had sat next to on the plane and in the squad car. So I waited for them to move him to the second cell that was holding the watch stealer. As I passed by the small window in that room I could see the watch stealer splayed out on the cot. He appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit. <p> After fingerprinting me and asking me about my height/weight/place and date of birth and so on, a middle-aged white cop with a beer belly and a flat top returned me -- without handcuffs -- to the cell. I waited, wondering if I would be spending the night locked up. I thought about the last words my husband said to me while I was still on the plane waiting on the tarmac, " They must have found out there was a Hebshi on the plane. " We joke about this at times, that because of my ethnicity I am being scrutinized but I had no intention of putting that out to the universe and making it happen. <p> I thought about Malcom X and how bravely and fastidiously he studied and wrote while he was in prison, how his solitude enabled him to transform his anger into social change and personal betterment. That 's when I decided to write this post. I needed to explain what had happened -- was happening -- to me. I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what my rights were, and though I felt violated and scared I was n't sure that our new laws protected me from this treatment. <p> The female agent returned to my cell with my cell phone. She wanted me to show her my tweets -- that were simultaneously posted onto Facebook -- I had composed while on the plane. She joked that she did n't even have a Facebook account. She left for a few minutes then returned and allowed me to call my husband. She said I would be released in a few minutes. <p> The sound of his voice brought me to tears, but I tried to remain calm. I gave him a one-minute recap of my situation, which only left him confused. I told him I would call him when I got to my car, which was parked in an airport lot. <p> I hung up the phone and followed the officer out of the cell and into another small room where the male FBI agent was waiting accompanied by another FBI agent -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of us were being released and there was nothing suspicious found on the plane. He apologized for what had happened and thanked me for understanding and cooperating. He said, " It 's 9/11 and people are seeing ghosts. They are seeing things that are n't there. " He said they had to act on a report of suspicious behavior, and this is what the reaction looks like. <p> He said there had been 50 other similar incidents across the country that day. <p> I was led out another door and down a long hall where I gathered my bags, which had been removed from the plane and searched. In the hallway I saw the other two men who had also been detained. They seemed happy to be being released as well. It felt strange to smile at them, and I did n't know what to say, so I said nothing. <p> We walked outside of the building, and for the first time I saw that we were at the airport police station, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security office to reside -- an office that did n't exist 10 years ago. It was starting to get dark. But I still did n't know what time it was. <p> Another officer drove me to my car in the airport parking lot. As he plopped into the drivers seat and me into the passenger 's seat of the unmarked sedan, he apologized for not having air conditioning, but, I thought snarkily, being a descendant of desert people I obviously did n't mind the heat. He asked me if I was OK to drive back to my home in Ohio, and I said I was, though I was n't sure I was. I was n't sure how this would affect me. I am still not sure. <p> All I know, is I probably wo n't be flying again on Sept. 11. <p> In the aftermath of my events on Sept. 11, 2011, I feel violated, humiliated and sure that I was taken from the plane simply because of my appearance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flight or tinkered with any " suspicious " device, I was forced into a situation where I was stripped of my freedom and liberty that so many of my fellow Americans purport are the foundations of this country and should be protected at any cost. <p> I believe in national security, but I also believe in peace and justice. I believe in tolerance, acceptance and trying -- as hard as it sometimes may be -- not to judge a person by the color of their skin or the way they dress. I admit to have fallen to the traps of convention and have made judgments about people that are unfounded. We live in a complicated world that, to me, seems to have reached a breaking point. The real test will be if we decide to break free from our fears and hatred and truly try to be good people who practice compassion -- even toward those who hate. <p> I feel fortunate to have friends and family members who are sick over what happened to me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plane who felt threatened enough to alert the authorities. This country has operated for the last 10 years through fear. We 've been a country at war and going bankrupt for much of this time. What is the next step? <h> 3,550 Comments <h> Erin O'Gara <p> This is beautiful, Shoshana -- had me in tears throughout and I could n't agree with you more. I 'm so sorry that this horrible thing happened to you, but am thankful that you are home safe and sound. Lots of hugs and love to you! <p> People have become so paranoid, scared of every shadow, every whisper that is n't government sanctioned. I am ashamed of people who react blindly. The sad truth is, the terrorists did win that day. 10 years later, people are still terrified. That 's the entire goal of terrorism.. until America stops the blind fear that makes situations like this possible, they will continue to win. <h> Tanya Harris <p> If they ever thanked me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand there will always be bigots. " I wish I could say it will never happen again, but I 'm fairly certain it will. Hopefully not to you, but definitely to someone else. I hope you bang a whole lot of pots and pans together. I hope you get people 's attention so that this school-yard bullying is exposed. And by the way, who 's to say that a " passenger " reported suspicious activity even though they say this was the case? I hate to say it, but maybe the group of you met their racial profiling criteria. Bye the way, love the blog. Tanya in Norfolk, Virginia <h> Toni <p> After visiting Russia in 2005, I noticed a lot of similarities between the US and Russia in terms of the paranoia and possibility of things like this happening. I pretty much believe that the terrorists that do exist out there are pretty much people all acting in response to oppression of this sort and this kind of policing helps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global standard for common sense treatment of people, this BS can end tomorrow. Unfortunately, things in most of the West will have to get worse first over the next decade before people really hit the limit. There is also too much information available for people to properly pursue issues, and the administrators of the US, Nato, EU know this. <h> Amanda <h> Allison <p> In addition to your excellent comment, the terrorists have also won in that they 've divided us even further. We had racial tension and race- and religion-based bigotry prior to 9/11, but it 's gotten so much more intense since then. <p> If the terrorists wanted to destroy America by turning us into each other 's enemies, they 've accomplished that task. <h> Russ <p> Do you think that is a result of terrorism, or perhaps the advent of social networking, anonymous blogging, and the many other ways people can express hatred with no consequences? <p> That 's not to say that there is any hatred in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have many outlets for hatred that did n't exist 10 years ago. This does n't stink of being a result of 9/11 to me. I think the author 's experience is awful and I wish it had n't happened, but I am also somewhat grateful for a system which does look into what someone may perceive as a serious threat. I survived the attack on Tower 1 of the World Trade Center on 9/11 so my perspective may somewhat subjective, but I would rather be detained or searched( and I was searched unnecessarily many times in the years immediately following the attacks) than have no tools for reporting something that may look suspicious to me. That being said, I think I have the ability to be rational enough not to report three people sitting on a plane not interacting with one another simply because they look suspicious for no reason other than my paranoia and the color of their skin. <p> Anyway, I do n't think the terrorists " won " because of this scenario. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson in why the methods to keep us safe need to be further refined, but at least there are efforts out there to do so. <h> Liz <p> " Searched "???! SEARCHED??!! The author was n't " searched, " she was STRIP searched!!! And, to you, that 's merely an " inconvenience "?? She was *imprisoned* and that 's just an " inconvenience "?? I 'm so glad you survived the 9/11 attacks, but to in any way, whatsoever, try to justify the cretins who reported " suspicious " behavior based *solely " on the physicaly appearance of the author is, well, criminal and obscene. There is no justification for what that idiot did. Their abject paranoia may be a *reason* but it is not an excuse. There is no excuse, and they should be subjected to the same " inconvenience " that the author and the other two passengers were. Period, end of story. The terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared " passenger did the right thing and you think that the author was merely inconvenienced because we have to be so scared that we utterly trash the Constitution by subjecting citizens to unreasonable search and seizure. DHS could have checked her background without all of that and found she was no threat, but they decided to go through with this heinous crime anyway. Inconvenienced, my arse. <h> Marla <p> Liz, I 'm reading no further after your post because you have said it all. Besides, I do n't think I could emotionally handle any of the gung-ho TSA responses which are surely here somewhere. Shoshanna 's log of events is one of the scariest accountings of this national stupidity I 've read to date. <h> Allison <p> I believe it 's a variety of factors, yes, and the anonymity of social media is a part of the change. But yes, I do believe that a huge percentage of it started because of 9/11. <p> While you, personally, may be rational enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And that, to me, is the most frightening aspect of this security theater nonsense that we 're forced to endure. Unsubstantiated reports of unspecified suspicious activity are taken at face value by authorities who then cuff people, sequester them, strip-search them, and interrogate them. Who assesses the validity of the original complaint? No one. Who 's held responsible when innocent people have their Constitutional rights violated for no reason? No one, because the original report can be just some jackass on a plane. <p> There is a middle ground between having " no tools for reporting " and violating people 's rights based on unsubstantiated rumor. We have to find that middle ground. <h> Niraj K. yadav <p> I 'm of Indian descent, with both my parents being Indian immigrants to the US. Having been born in the US, I 'm a citizen by birth, but one of those two men could easily have been me on that plane. And nothing scares me more than the fact that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of my skin. <p> My question to those who feel it is not a major outlet from 9/11 is this : If the people beside her had been Caucasian,, would this have ever been reported? Or, instead, as I 've seen happen on many a flight, would a steward(ess) have rather made sure the individual(s) in question were OK, understanding that illness does occur amongst people of all walks of life and that just because 3 people sitting together seem to be of a similar race does not necessarily mean that they are actually in some sort of conspiracy to commit a crime? I highly doubt it. <h> dave <p> If this had been racial profiling, would n't some action have been taken much sooner than near the conclusion of the flight? I gather that nothing was noted as unusual about any of this threesome until the two men went to the bathroom together and spent ' a long time in there '. I imagine( tens of) thousands of middle easterners were probably flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after 9/11. Were all of these also detained and questioned? We have only heard one side of this ' story '( which is all we will get given protocols agencies have to follow), but, gee, there could be a second side to the matter. <p> So.... is it better to ignore suspicious behavior -- under the guise of being politically correct -- and have a plane blown up instead killing a hundred? Okay, maybe it 's just me... but I guess I would consider it a bit odd if two men that apparently do n't know each other go into the lavatory together and spend an ' inordinately long time in there ' together.... <h> Englishman <p> As a European " anglo-saxon ", I have no trouble with this over cautious reaction, given the level of concern about the significance of the date. BUT, there is no excuse for this level of discourtesy. It is very possible to show a MUCH higher respect for the detainee whilever the possibility remains that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no case to answer. Unfortunately, my limited experience of US homeland security, in the form of Passport control both in 1974, 2003 2004 and in 2006, is one of open hostility to non-US visitors. <h> Gigi G. <p> Oh now Dave... I was n't going to make any comment here because there are already so many great remarks but I have to respond to your nonsense. <p> You obviously have no experience traveling on planes. What you suggest is just so utterly ignorant I ca n't possibly be more polite about it. It is not at ALL uncommon for the two passengers... to get up and go to toilets at the same time. It happens like this... the guy on the outside has to go so when he dos the guy sitting in the middle( she said she was sitting by the window) decides it 's a good time to go too. That way he wo n't disturb the other guy later... it happens all the time. It 's called consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only strange to people who are paranoid and racist! AND do you know WHY someone might spend an inordinate amount of time in the toilet? It 's called constipation and it happens OFTEN when traveling on airplanes! <p> And who is so frigging nosey that they would even be keeping track of how long someone goes to the toilet? A busy body... that 's who. And what? They were in the SAME toilet cubicle together? I doubt it. This is just a case of some nosey biddy body doing what they do best : gossip. And I 'll just bet you if any one bothered to check the person who raised the alarm probably has a history of " raising the alarm ". <p> And do n't tell me that our very " intelligent "( I use the term loosely) FBI could n't have assessed the situation and figured out just by quietly doing their homework on these people before the plane even touched the ground that there was no risk. <h> jon <p> My bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time the Indian gentlemen spent in the toilets. I also get pissed of with such people, which normally includes almost everyone except me. <p> On a different note, I long ago added the US to the list of countries I will not visit, along with Somalia and Yemen. The only time I accidentally visited the US was a transit in Guam in 2007 en route to Majuro -- a very unpleasant meeting with some TSA goons and a destroyed suitcase. <h> Ron <p> Wow, Kimberly Lohr, you might be the most ignorant person in the world. Your grandfather fought to protect everyone 's rights, but you support the trampling of the rights of your fellow American? It seems that you cherish the freedom that you have, but do n't seem to care if a brown skinned person is locked up for no reason other than her appearance. Hypocrisy is the worst of all sins. <p> If you 're not downright stupid, then you are a horrible person. I hope it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sympathy. <h> SilenceDogood <p> No, Hazey, people like you who so badly want your security at any cost need to leave the USA for places where that already exists. Those places are called North Korea, Iran, Cuba, for starters. I hear they 're lovely this time of year, and offer the best of safety and security for their citizens. <h> orangecountyresident <p> Hazey, people like you and Kimberly cause me to lose respect for this country. And no, I 'm not going to leave. I 'm going to stay here and vote for people that do n't think like you two. People like you and Kimberly are a million times worse than the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. <h> orangecountyresident <p> Wow Kimberly, you are a racist pig. It 's people like you that make me ashamed of this country and you are one of the reasons why I did n't go to any 9/11 memorials. Too many people who remember the victims of 9/11 think like you. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 9/11 itself. <h> Mike <p> To begin with, you do n't have to shout. It makes me think you 're crazy. And second, unless you are of Asian or African descent, I doubt seriously that your Great Great Grandfather sweated much at all. It was people of the aforementioned descent who did all the real work of building this country. And by the way, there have been Caucasians who have been arrested for acts or intent to commit acts of terrorism. First, there were the Oklahoma City Bombers and then there was Jihad Jane who was arrested last year in Philadelphia. She was blond and blue. Get a grip and learn something. <h> googlie@yahoo.net <p> Wow, you 're an idiot. If you even had the slightest clue what the real definition of terrorism is and pay attention to what 's happening in this country you would understand that the largest group of radical terrorists in the world who are bent on terrorizing the people of amerika, and the world for that latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun toting overweight illiterate gas holes. You and your country do n't even have a dollar bill as every dollar in circulation in the US is borrowed from foreign interests including the paper it is printed on because your great grandfather was n't as great as you imagine him to be. Furthermore if your God was anything more than an imaginary low life loser you would actually trust him for your protection and not some gun toting, psychologically unstable, otherwise unemployable complete stranger. <p> If you believe civil liberties is having some complete stranger chain you up at the barrel of a gun and jam their hands up your A22 for their pleasure and imagined " protection " you should remove your head from yours and start feeling the freedom. <p> It would be great if you and your ilk would leave instead of destroying this country with your idiocracy. <h> Carmen LeBlanc <p> Common sense is the middle ground... before law enforcement reacts as they reacted here there must be probable cause to react. what exactly is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement training sees two dark skinned men get up at the same time to go to the bathroom and somehow that arises to the level of detention and strip searching. Really? Thats where we are now? I want to understand where the ability came here for the government to detail the passengers, handcuff, strip search and then <p> I heard ZERO evidence that would lead one to believe that there were explosives involved here -- that was a fiction invented by the government to justify what they had done to that moment. " Oh, we 'd better check for explosives " Hey idiots -- the plane was ON THE GROUND AT ITS DESTINATION! If they were going to blow it up they would not do so after it landed at its destination. <p> Is there ANY common sense left in our nation? <p> There was ZERO reason to detain, ZERO reason to search and zero reason to question. They certainly can talk to these guys all they want -- my reaction would have been silence. F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- end of story. You have a problem with that? Wait a minute? Am I being detained? If so why? Am I free to go? What are the facts upon which you are basing your detention -- the time has come to end the idiots running around trying to justify the billions spent on their toys. <h> Arif <p> First of all, I feel for the lady and the other two and the rest of people( crew/passengers) for what the went through. <p> Wow, you are one sharp cookie. Have you forgotten this is the nation where at one point the whole family or anyone can walk up the the terminal, see their friends or family members get on the plane. And if you were like my family, you would wait till the plane takes off and then leave the terminal. What changed and who changed it? Have you forgotten how many lives are taken away from how many loved ones? Have thought about how many people were affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind) are going through? People who survived are still having nightmares. I 'm Christian and a US citizen, but because I 'm from Pakistan my airline ticket is always marked ' randomly '. I do n't have any problem with it. USA has every right to protect their properties anyways she wants. If I or anyone do n't like it, can leave and go back to their homes. The fact is, this is my home, I 'm afraid to go back home( Pakistan) because Muslims, so called radicals are killing Christians without any reason. If this incident were to take place on Pakistan airline, with an american or even a Paki christian involved, how do you think it would 've went? I tell you how. The detained persons would be either be sent to prison with some religious blame if no explosive found, then killed. Stop blaming USA for what it has become, it is our fault. We just have to live with it. <h> Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they treat the author in such an ridiculous fashion! What are the charges, Probable cause, Warrant? Who swore to the fact that they where suspicious? Who started this mess and let it continue to propagate? The only thing that separates us from the " disappearances " of the Nazi regime is the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. NONE of which has been repealed! If this happened 50 times that day, there should be 50 cases filed in Federal court. WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE? The reason the toilet in her cell was dirty is because they had been using it to flush America down the drain! GGGGRRRR! <h> ruth <p> Arif and Irish -- the extent that they investigated still does not warrant a STRIP search including CAVITY search of this woman. She did not even go to the bathroom -- the people sitting next to her did. Let 's see how well you do with a stranger poking around in your vagina or butthole when you 've done nothing and every indication of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on. <p> There is a story developing in this thread that someone " paranoid " on the plane saw something like " two dark-skinned men get up together to go to the bathroom " and this is being discussed vis-a-vis the plausibility or not of making a( racially profiled) report to the authorities. Let 's stop that right now. <p> No such passenger is needed( you could blame the flight crew instead ; perhaps even a more plausible angle to take, as they 'd have the ability to report suspicious activity in-flight more readily than people with Facebook and iPhones, etc), but this is not necessary either. Moreover, it does n't matter what the men did or did n't do. They could have sat there sleeping the whole time, it makes no difference, so let 's stop trying to understand this in terms that we can imagine as rationally plausible or possible. <p> We are, of course, hopelessly naive in the United States about this sort of thing. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they saw in the Soviet Union or in Romania, where it was facetiously referred to as the national sport. <p> Whatever we are going to have " security " look like, the very fact that it is this kind of response and that it encourages people to be informants( whether this is a case of one or not) is the larger issue we should be concerned with, whether we think we 'll be detained or not -- because eventually comes the day when " your kind " will be detained, and by then, it 'll be too late. <p> There is a story developing in this thread that someone " paranoid " on the plane saw something like " two dark-skinned men get up together to go to the bathroom " and this is being discussed vis-a-vis the plausibility or not of making a( racially profiled) report to the authorities. Let 's stop that right now. <p> That 's not " a story developing, " it 's what happened. That 's established. So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone by making a false report, which is not what happened here. The discussion is not about the theories, it 's about a specific event that is holographically indicative of a change in American society that is producing social friction and dislocation, and about how to reverse it. Those who read the entire thread are able to discern this and avoid tangential discussions. <p> Thank you for tuning in to the discussion. There are other discussions taking place elsewhere. <h> Snow Leopard <p> Shaykh al-Hajj Dawud Ahmad al-Amriki : thank you for keeping things focused. What I meant by the " developing story " was the thread of the story as it was being told in the comments. For example, at some point( below), someone finally discovers that it was a flight attendant( Elizabeth Something) who did the reporting, and then later, that she was passing on anonymous information from other travelers. That 's what I mean by the " developing story ". The facts of what actually happened are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread were getting bogged down over details that, in the contextual significance of this event, either do n't matter or are usually taken by people to make excuses for it happening, just as people in Soviet Russia made up reasons why the security forces were carrying away their neighbors. Such details here included bluntly suggesting that the original poster must have been doing SOMETHING suspicious or whether the two men went to the bathroom at the same time or went to the same bathroom at the same time -- one guy even develops a whole doctrine of how to fly, saying if you DO get up to go to the bathroom at the same time as someone else, tell the stewardess that you 're going back for gay sex. I 'd like to think he was being ironic or trying to be funny, but I do n't think he was. <p> In this particular post, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that the specifics of WHO did the reporting matters less than that SOMEONE made a report, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the original poster were doing, and in fact did n't matter. That 's what I wanted to underline. <p> In this particular post, I wanted to draw attention to the fact that the specifics of WHO did the reporting matters less than that SOMEONE made a report, and that it would n't matter what the two men or the original poster were doing, and in fact did n't matter. That 's what I wanted to underline. <p> We 're witnessing a generation for whom oppression and tyranny are " givens " and inconsequential if they have no first-hand experience or are able to avoid them. This may be persistent. <p> Thank you. It 's a holographic portrait of the quasi-literate middle-management demographic sector of the collapsing economic order, with occasional glimpses of the more subjugated classes. I see a few armchair revolutionaries, a bit of magistry, but virtually no statecraft. Sadly, that 's not a surprise. <h> Tina <p> Ma'am it sounds to me like they were researching the validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaint was valid and there was a security risk. Putting her in a room alone where she could n't talk to others if she had " cohorts " and searching her for any items pertaining to a terrorist threat. <p> We do live in a paranoid society, but we also have some reason to be concerned. We 're hearing everyday of people using their CHILDREN as bombs, or hiding explosives up their derrieres. People are crazy, and they do these things because they think that they 'll get through basic searches if they go to extremes. <p> Had she been a threat, and somebody was concerned and brought her to attention and they said no we want to be politically correct and not stop her, or just ask her her name and see she 's an american citizen so not wanting to go against her rights let her go what would have happened if she 'd walked into the airport and blown herself up in the middle of it? They 'd be shocked, and angry, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look into it, it was brought to your attention, etc. Just like 9/11 there were reports, and information that was n't acted upon. <p> The part of the entire story that bothers me is the lack of respect, in my opinion they needed to detain her and follow through with making sure she was n't a risk, but they could have been more courteous about it on the off chance she was n't a risk and was just trying to get home. If it were me on a plane with my child and I saw something suspicious i 'd hope like hell my comments would n't be ignored. And two people getting up at the same time and going to the bathroom IS kinda weird. We have no clue if they were concerned because of the color of their skin, or because these men were getting up and walking out of view together. <p> " We do live in a paranoid society, but we also have some reason to be concerned. We 're hearing everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosives up their derrieres.

It seems to me people who believe they are " hearing everyday of people using their children as bombs " will inevitably be anxious and trigger happy when it comes to reporting suspicious behaviour. I think the media and the government have a lot to answer for as they have created this climate of fear that turns people against each other. <p> @Tina : Please think about what you said there. Think about a parent using their child as a bomb. Would you do it? Of course not. Would your neighbour do it? Of course not. In fact you 'll find a lot more children harmed by their parents through abuse or even homicide after a marriage breakup. <p> Either you believe there are a lot of mentally ill parents out there who would do what most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in their life or you believe certain people are predisposed to such acts of violence that somehow the rest of the civilised world is immune to. <p> Sting wrote a great song that tried to point out that the cold war created barriers between people who were essentially the same. It was called " I Hope the Russians Love their Children Too ". <p> I put it to you that human beings are all the same all over the world, regardless of race or religion. What you fear is IMAGINARY, or at the very least, greatly exaggerated. When you realise this, you will be freed from the shackles of fear and be able to live a normal life. I live in Australia where this climate of fear exists too, but it 's being directed at Asylum Seekers. All common sense has gone out the window and many people want them to be left to die on their boats. It 's shameful but the root cause is the same -- unfounded FEAR. <p> Actually, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else, Kabdoo, I agree with in your comments. I 've never heard anyone saying that " they use children for bombs. " It 's a total line of bullshit and fearmongering, hands down. <h> Martha <p> It may not be happening here in the USA but it does happen over in Israel. One Israeli once said something to the effect that the Palestinians would stop using their young as suicide bombers when the parents loved their children more than they hated the Jewish people. <h> SilenceDogood <h> bn1511 <p> I do n't understand why the behavior of the two men, one following another to the bathroom, is in the least bit suspicious... <p> If I do n't have the aisle, I almost always wait for the person in the aisle to go to the bathroom before I go... it 's less disruptive and I think it 's more respectful( though not required) of your fellow passenger... <p> This is disgusting beyond words... that we corrupt basic human dignity and behavior in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 plus times a year, I know how irritated I would be if someone in the window seat always wanted to make me move so they can go to the toilet and I know how appreciative I would be if they coordinated their " visits " with mine. <p> But then, I do n't look at people of color and instantly reach conclusions about their motivation. <p> I hope you and your child always stay safe but understand that sacrificing basic human dignity at the altar of " feeling good " will only ensure your child will grow up in a world full of bigotry and hate. If that 's what you want then by all means, soldier on. <h> Ravan Asteris <p> So all forms of fascism are justified for the CHILDREN? What kind of world does that leave the CHILDREN, then? Do you want your CHILDREN to grow up worry that they might be detained based on the color of their skin, way they dress, or slang they speak? <p> If you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the way through. <p> The whole situation was far too much for some paranoid racist saying that fiddling with a phone and sitting next to other dark skinned people is ' suspicious '. <p> By your logic we should have a nice trustworthy grandma eyeing people as they enter the airpoirt and just pointing out the ' dodgy looking ' ones, and questioning them for 6 hours each. After all, " what would have happened if they 'd walked into the airport and blown themselves up in the middle of it? " " Why did n't you trust the grandma?! " they 'd cry! <h> ruth <p> Tina -- the extent that they investigated still does not warrant a STRIP search including CAVITY search of this woman. She did not even go to the bathroom -- the people sitting next to her did. Let 's see how well you do with a stranger poking around in your vagina or butthole when you 've done nothing and every indication of your demeanor and response is that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. No. No. Getting up to use the restroom at the same time as your neighbor is not weird. It 's courteous, so you do n't have to bother them later. I do this all the time. Your paranoid behavior is making me reconsider being courteous. <h> Paul <p> Shoshana, thank you for sharing your horrendous ordeal with us ; it is too too real. Since 9/11, Americans have been encouraged to fear and to be suspicious of others. It seems that.. a sick paranoia has been seeded into the minds and hearts of Americans of " the other. " It is regrettable and unjust that these " false witnesses " are never identified or made responsible for their actions/diminuendo 's.. It is a disgrace that we do n't even know our rights... for it seems that you had none... just no words for you, no answers for you... just the guilty until proven not guilty treatment ; certainly not in keeping with the American Justice System. Thank you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Completely agree with Allison above. There are no easy answers, but we 've been blasted too much by fear and unfortunately that is a great tool for the use of power without regard. We, the people, have to keep up the pressure on the authorities to find a middle ground -- to protect us without violating us. I am confident a nation like this one, founded on those very principles, can face that challenge and reach that goal! <h> Mike <h> Jason <p> It is unfortunatate that this happens at all. I 'm of ethnic origin myself( not sure exactly which because my mother was adopted) and so I consider myself black. Since 9/11 I noticed that ' at random ' must be written somewhere on my birth certificate. Every flight I have been on since, I have been instructed to remove my shoes and go through screening processess different from the other passengers. As a former member of a special operations unit, I 'm appalled at the ' freedom ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just glad you have a means of telling people the ordeals people of ethniticity go through while the majority of the population read caucasions simply view it as being ' vigilant '. <h> Missa <p> Is this Professor Shaheen? I met you and your wife in Columbia Missouri several years ago after you gave a presentation. My little son was the one that complained he wanted to go home so he would n't miss Leno. And you said your daughter worked for him <h> Dan from NYC <p> @ Allison -- Having traveled quite a bit both domestically and internationally over the years I can authoritatively state that current U.S. procedures may seem stringent but are far less so than other " active " zones. <p> Regarding first verifying the validity of the report, elsewhere herein I stated the case thus, " everything that occurred once the report(s) were transmitted to the flight crew is exactly what one would demand of our law enforcement entities. A report must be taken with the greatest gravity until proved otherwise. <p> A softer response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other aircraft and underground fuel lines and the deplaned passengers in a much more heavily populated terminal. Had the threat been an actual assault with massive death and mayhem resulting, would we not be excoriating law enforcement for their " lack of vision "? " <p> No one 's rights were violated to say otherwise displays a layman 's misunderstanding of the law. I agree that since 9-11 the threshold of " reasonable " search and seizure 4th Amendment has been redefined.by the circumstances arising from those events. The very ambiguity of the use of the phrase " reasonable " allows for interpretation as society 's needs change. So legal definitions may change without any actual infringement occurring. <p> As such, it is not the law or it 's enforcement that is at fault. It is our individual lack of awareness of the law as well the definition and significance of the words employed, the ultimate and final arbiter being the SCOTUS. <p> All that being as it is, well before the events of 9-11 the well established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment/5.4 " Exigent circumstances arise when the law enforcement officers have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an immediate need to protect their lives, the lives of others, their property, or that of others, the search is not motivated by an intent to arrest and seize evidence, and there is some reasonable basis, to associate an emergency with the area or place to be searched. " <h> Cindy <p> So some college kid playing a " prank ", some bigot who does n't like the color of your skin, some mentally unstable person.... basically anyone can say anything without validation???? I guarantee you that if the three of them had been white, nothing would have happened. End of story. You can try to make it sound better by saying that law enforcement had to act on the report.... but who made the report? There are a lot of bigots in this country and a lot of people use the bathroom on planes. Are we now going to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them what is going on? I say you detain the person who reported the activity and strip search them. Whose to say they are not deflecting attention away from themselves and are up to mischief. In no way was this right. From the " person " who reported it, to the flight crew who passed it on, to the police who detained and ultimately the FBI and Homeland Security. Thank goodness my skin is white so I can fly without fear even though she is just as much a citizen as I am. It is criminal and she should file a suit in a court of law. Then maybe things will change. Is Hitler ruling our country now??? Must everyone be white to have rights and not be " suspicious "? <h> DavosSherman <p> Cindy : Doubt it. Sounds more like a cabin flight crew-member who got nervous and jerky over someone taking a 20 minute $hit. If the flight deck crew had any doubts they should have diverted. The entire thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops -- what effing terrorsist would blow a plane up at the destination gate? I 'm glad I 'm no longer a line captain. <h> Dan from NYC <p> You are assuming the report was racially motivated and presume that if the report was about a white person it would be ignored or handled differently. While Shoshanna may have " felt " it was racially motivated that does n't mean that in fact it was. To argue it was a racially motivated report replaces logic and analysis with supposition from a predisposed belief that is itself akin to the mind set of a racist. <p> Also to assume your white skin shields you from suspicion and experiencing a similar detention is based on a fallacy. I think one name should cover it, Timothy McVeigh. Do you honestly believe that law enforcement would ignore a report of suspicious activity made against three whites or that protocols would be different for them? Given Janet Napalitino 's expressed views on white terrorists you can be assured that Homeland Security 's response would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accepted definition of something being racially motivated is that " if only one person thinks it is racially motivated, then it is. " Since the author does feel this way, the incident was therefore racially motivated. <h> Jess <p> You feel that the rights of human beings to be free from unnecessary, unwarranted, and unreasonable police detention and violation should be thrown out on the word of the stupidest, most cowardly cretin on an airplane? <p> Why could n't you just go live in a country like that, instead of turning America into one? <h> Dan from NYC <p> Please define your terms, " unnecessary, unwarranted, and unreasonable " and what information you are basing that judgement call on. Drawing conclusions from fanciful predisposed beliefs rather than available facts is an emotional process and not a logical one. <p> I am sorry Shoshanna went through a very tough time. I can, and do, empathize with her and wish her a full recovery from this experience. Her anger and hurt are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for designing response protocols to a potential threat. <h> Irish <p> There was no threat. We ca n't run around hiding from " potential threats ". Potential threats can come from misunderstandings, bigotry, emotion. There should be no actions on potential threats. Two guys get up to go to the bathroom who look like middle eastern men. They come back and sit next to a woman who looks middle eastern... Where is the threat? When the coward who started this asked the Flight attendant for help, she should have " shooshed " him... At the very least, she should have gone the the row, engaged the folks in conversation, asked if they needed anything. Is there still a threat? Are they acting strange, avoiding eye contact, covering an object under their shirt? You do n't need fancy training for this. Sadly, it involves common sense and some basic observation skills. YOU have to get involved The fact is that there are SSSOOOO many security checks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone boards. We need to ensure that there is a real reason to be worried before we call in the Police state. Waving it all off to " good protocols " is like slapping the author on the A$$ after her strip search and offering her a cigarette! Shame on everyone who even thinks this behavior from our government and the people on this plane was somehow justified! <h> Raging Itch <p> The people who had their rights violated were innocent. The fact that us there was a response in force means that resources were diverted from other, more credible, threats. There are finite resources, so wasting them on non-threats is dangerous. <p> If law enforcement is unable to determine if a report of suspicious behavior will pass the Sniff Test, then they are doing it wrong. -- -- <p> BOTTOM LINE : the world is n't safe. Everyone who reads this will die. You make the choice whether to live in fear or REFUSE TO BE TERRORIZED. <p> Right. A false positive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duty to appear and conduct ourselves at all times so that there is no possibility that we will arouse suspicion and divert the authorities from the real evildoers. Anything else is the moral equivalent of turning in a false alarm. <h> Allison <p> The fact that other countries do worse things to fliers does not mean that we should either follow their example or be complacent when things happen here with which we disagree. <p> What I expect of law enforcement officials is actually NOT to take every single report " seriously, " in the sense that every single report should be considered valid enough to strip search the subject of the report. In civilian law enforcement, when a report is made, the officers at least question the person making the report to determine, among other things, the validity of the report being made. They ask questions of the reporter to determine if the report has a basis in fact, and contains reasonable cause to follow up. As far as I can tell, reporters of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way -- a person says " I am suspicious of X, " and the authorities basically say " OK! " and proceed with handcuffs, detention, strip searches, and interrogations. <p> That 's not acceptable. The authorities should, at the very least, interview the reporter FIRST to determine if the reporter has any legitimacy to his or her claims. In the current situation, people make reports of suspicious activity are not held accountable for those reports. Such a system contains no checks and balances on people making the reports based on, as in this case, ethnicity rather than actual behavior( from what I can tell). <p> There is a middle ground between what occurred, and the so-called " softer response " example you provide which is basically do nothing. <p> The rest of your information is much appreciate, and I plan to read it in depth. <h> Dan from NYC <p> You are correct that law enforcement officials have to make judgement calls on reports all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain kinds of reports. <p> For example, here in New York, any report of domestic violence must be taken as a fact and they are required to detain the person against whom the report is made even if the individual who complains recants. It 's not always fair and the arrest warranted or not proceeds in much the same manner that as Shoshana experienced. <p> We are not party to what intelligence indicated regarding terrorist activity or possible plans -- especially on the tenth anniversary of 9-11 that would scramble two F-16 fighter jets to escort the flight to Detroit. We also have this statement from FBI Detroit spokesperson Sandra Berchtold, " Due to the anniversary of Sept. 11, all precautions were taken, and any slight inconsistency was taken seriously, " Berchtold said. " The public would rather us err on the side of caution than not. " <p> The other passengers were reported to have been taken by bus to police headquarters, held and questioned. While we might suppose what they experienced we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they are vetted and cleared and in all likelihood searched and/or scanned. <p> Dan : what you are saying is all entirely defensible, on the presupposition that one must follow a law( procedure, or protocol) simply by virtue of existing. Police who enforced segregationist policies in the US South and elsewhere might have felt a similar queasiness even as they " did their duty ". So your argument ignores those occasions when civil disobedience becomes the moral necessity. <p> You are also ignoring what prompts people to make reports that then, under an interpretation of an exigent circumstance, must( indeed) be carried through to its grim conclusion. A demonstrable pattern of false positives and the skin color of US air travelers is not a dismissible pattern, and this instance might be in or out of that pattern factually, but it is definitely in the pattern circumstantially. <p> Basically, the point you are defending is a moot one. Very few people would disagree that " suspicious circumstances should be investigated " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be investigated. " The issue, rather, is what criteria do we accept for someone reporting a suspicious circumstance? We can look at the kinds of circumstances where people reported something serious and it turned out to be accurate -- such as the strange object found in a bathroom or other public place. So finding a suspicious package in an airplane bathroom would be a likely candidate. Where are the cases where a " suspicious person " turned out to be a suspicious person? I know of no cases, and the current evidence of this thread is that racial profiling is creating a red herring( and will serve as a way for terrorists to be more effective in being invisible -- see the white Jihad Jane, etc). <p> When it becomes culturally acceptable -- under whatever pretense -- to take anyone 's informing in an uncritical way, then we are veering toward a socially dangerous situation. It creates circumstances where people can deliberately generate false positives in various ways and for various reasons( as some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example you cite). At the very least, in cases of false positives, there should be or could be repercussions for the one making the false report. In fact, for domestic violence, if the police determine that someone has made a false accusation, then that person may be charged with making a false report. In that case also, the person making the report is already known to the one accused. In this case, there is no such confrontation or repercussions, but there should be. <p> You might say this would dissuade people from making reports. That 's as it should be. People should not feel free to indulge in their racist fantasies about their fellow travelers. Laypeople have no idea what " reasonable grounds " are and they can still err on the side of caution and also moderate their fear-driven imaginings by forcing themselves to a certain level of internal confidence that their report really, actually, does need to be made. Moreover, in the case of a false positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused -- aside from the sense of justice in this, it is also an educating moment, as it teaches that person that their basis for suspecting this person( perhaps because of the color of their skin) was unjust. We should want, culturally, to dissuade false positives( reports that lead to false positives), although of course it is in the interests of the ruling powers to put us in a situation where a sense of helplessness or fear makes us have to call authorities to deal with situations. That 's the moment that critically, socially disempowers us, and puts us that much closer to trammeled civil liberties and a police state. <p> With your respect for the rule of law, I would think you would support an addition to the current procedure that supported the effective function of the rule of law, rather than the effective abuse of law that allows authoritative bodies to further erode civil rights under the color of authority and arguments about national security. <h> Ron <h> kay <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists not winning because of this scenario and that this is a lesson about our system needing refinement. The protocol for dealing with such situation does not develop into a perfect system over night... not even over ten years. I am a flight attendant and I have a pretty good idea about how Shoshana 's situation manifested and to some extent I suspect she is correct... that she was included in the scenario because of the way she looks. Unfortunately, this is a result of the events ten years ago and of the intelligence that has been attained since then about how future attempts might be carried out. At this point, there is no better protocol than hypervigilance and that means that sometimes people are going to be held in suspicion until proven innocent. This is NOT meant to be the American way, but it is the best we 've got for now to prevent another incident like the one ten years ago. <p> I feel bad that Shoshana had to endure such humiliation and I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may look like those men who orchestrated the horrific attacks in 2001 is a terrorist. I am certain, though, that she was included for another reason and that is the perceived suspicious behavior of her seatmates. In the end, these factors came together to create a situation that looked much like what might be the makings of a possible attack. Thankfully, as it turns out, the situation was completely innocent. Given that there was evidence of plans in the works for more attacks on this anniversary, I do not believe the actions taken in this instance were overdone. I am happy to know that the authorities treated Shoshana and her seat-partners with as much courtesy and respect as is possible in such a situation. In many other parts of the world, suspects are not treated as well. <h> Jacqi <p> I so agree with you, Russ. If we had been more cautious 10 years ago, maybe the disaster would not have been so great. However, it is what is, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I am sorry the writer was arrested, but in my book, better safe than sorry. Protocol is protocol. What is with people texting, tweeting, and talking nonstop on their cells, and computers when it is apparent that something is occurring. Could this have helped lead to the suspicions of the crew? <h> Ann <h> jeanne <p> Survivor of 9/11 Tower 1 : Your comment is SO well said, I too, would rather have this awful experience, because, yes, SOMETHING works... we remain safe from, most likely, hundreds of thwarted attempts at showing us we CAN be hurt!! <h> Allison <p> Please provide citations to support your assertion that the violation of people 's Constitutional rights has resulted in " hundreds of thwarted attempts. " <p> We can not assume that these things are working to keep us safer. And even if they are, we are sacrificing ideals that are supposed to be " uniquely " American -- freedom, justice, equality -- for this nebulous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true wonder. Your arguments are sound a realistic. Keep up the verbal sparring... let 's start a petition to force repeal of the Patriot Act. I recently heard a story on NPR about a middle aged white guy video taping the Mall of America( where he lives) to send to family over seas... He was arrested, sat for hours in a secret cell under the building and now has an FBI file and police record. For taping a video of an American tourist destination in his town to send to family. Another guy was fired, and while the arguments counter his claim that he was fired for being a loud mouthed liberal, it does n't matter. He too has an FBI file and a police report with his name on it. I am angry. Just by writing something like this, we could end up in someone 's hot water. " The only thing to fear is fear itself. " We 've let fear win and we 've lost so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did skin colour define someone 's ability to harm others? We are so quick to judge others based on appearances. Yet, we fail to realise that sometimes the threat lies within the people we think are harmless. The police, the military, etc. I am grateful for what they do to protect the safety of the people, but at what cost? Has it really come down to violating innocent people 's constitutional rights just for the sake of clarifying a rumour with unfounded evidence? We also fail to realise that we do as much harm to other countries as we are doing to OUR VERY OWN CITIZENS. Lets recap this whole war against terrorism : we falsely accused people and stripped them of their constitutional rights for the sake of national security. BUT who protects those who were violated both in our country and elsewhere? The numerous people who were murdered or raped as a result of this war on terrorism. WHERE IS THEIR JUSTICE? Are they not people as well? Just because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat them any less than we expect for ourselves and families. I do support the underlying concept of security, but have we really let ourselves go to paranoia and fear? Before we act, we should act on solid evidence or at least pieces of solid evidence and not rumours before determining someone is a terrorist. <h> Tom Triumph <p> How was the Constitution violated? When one goes through security at the airport you are told a what the rules were. Someone accuses you and the police hold you so they can check it out. Holding someone for a limited period of time does not violate the Constitution. It sucks being held, and the fellow passenger might be an idiot, but the officers did their job without bias or abuse and you were writing about it the next day. <p> It just bothers me that people jump so fast in assuming this when shitty stuff happens. We want people to use common sense, but, to be honest, that leads to bias and old boy networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( often limited). A rule of law treats everyone the same, so the author was n't left to rot or treated poorly because she 's " one of them ". Instead, she was investigated and released the same day. The Constitution, and the officers ' following it, got her through quickly and without incident. <h> David <p> Well said Tom. As she speaks of being pulled out because of the way she looks, she claims it to be because of the way she looks. Yet because the officers detaining her look to be the " REDNECK TYPE " she speaks of hating everything that might be Redneckish. If she wants for everyone to love each other then maybe should also live by the rule. I feel bad for what has happen to the young lady, but if you do nt want the sterotype thinking to go on then start by living with no hate youreself. <h> Sheep Hurrdurr <p> But that 's besides the point, because these people were n't arrested. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what charges they were arrested under, feel free, because even they do n't know. <p> Strip/cavity searches, racial profiling, arrest without charges... all of these are " bias and abuse ". " A rule of law treats everyone the same ", so yes, I think it 's safe to say America does n't have a rule of law. <h> Christian Lyons <p> Really, a strip and orifice search is not a type of abuse? Come on. Her background check and interview should have precluded a strip/orifice search. How humiliating for this poor woman. I think she 's being rather kind in her blog. If it were me being falsely accused and strip/orifice searched, I think I 'd be a lot more upset than this. If this were an elderly white woman sitting next to two Indian guys, I doubt she would have been subjected to the same " process. " This is coming from a 46 year old white male and former flight attendant who was actually in flight during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS bias. Bias on the part of the unknown and uninvestigated fellow passenger who originally made the false accusation. Then, bias on the part of the authorities who took that false accusation at face value without determining whether the accusation had any merit to begin with. <p> Of course, we have these regulations only because of the eight years of the GWBush administration. Now our society is being prodded into becoming suspicious of our fellow Americans instead of the powerful politicians who deserve to be scrutinized. <h> Show-me Skeptic <p> Constitution not violated? Are you nuts? This woman was dragged off a plane, handcuffed, strip searched and detained. All she did was travel by air while dark-skinned -- I guess in the modern-day U.S., that 's a crime! The Constitution was most assuredly violated, it guarantees that we wil be free from unreasonable searched and seizures. This strip search and this detwention( seizure) were blatantly unreasonable. Somebody needs to be fired over this. <h> rba8053 <p> Tom Triumph is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not charged for anything due to her race. It does suck, but it is for the safety of everyone. Being a patriotic American and of Latino descent, if Mexico or any other Latin country did something as awful as the 9/11 attacks, I would be completely understanding of being searched on the anniversary of the attacks when I am traveling on the exact same method of the attack. I would not be whining or crying. <p> You have to look beyond yourself sometimes at what is best for the country, not just you. We have become so selfish, and the media portrays all these rights in an incorrect light. Just because you get pulled over for speeding and you are of color does not mean you were racially profiled. If we continue down this line of reasoning that everyone who is racially profiled and simply questioned( not even arrested or treated bad) has had their civil rights violated, law enforcement will be walking on egg shells around anyone of color, and violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prevalent and easy. <p> Thank you Shoshana for doing your American duty of answering the questions and cooperating with the authorities. It sucks you were detained in that fashion, but it was done properly and as a preventative measure on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack. You should be proud to have been helpful in clearing it up, but without complaining. <h> Irish <p> rba8053... You must work for the Government! I have looked over your comments to many of the posters... Look away from the author being Arabic/Jewish. scrub her color from the picture. She was arrested, STRIP SEARCHED, SEXUALLY ASSAULTED( cavity searched), detained, and questioned without a warrant or probable cause. YOU need to re-think your belief that the Constitution and further SCOTUS interpretations allow for this! In the absence of known criminal behavior, not being informed of the charges against her, I think it is perfectly reasonable for the author to wonder if the reason she was being treated this way was because of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU PERSONALLY should reflect on this situation! Re-think and re-read the 4th Amendment and the relevant SCOTUS decisions. Arabic, Latino, Irish, or Black ; No AMERICAN should be treated this way!! Shame on you for suggesting otherwise! <h> Mike <p> Mr.Latino, Will you be ok if you were racially profiled in Arizona for " looking like an illegal immigrant who jumped over the border with 13 kids ". How about searching you for machetes and suspected of being a radical member of " La Raza " groups. <h> J.D. <p> This case is a clear-cut violation of constitutional rights. Yes, in cases of imminent &; credible national security threats, our " normal " rights may be stepped on in that greater interest. However, there clearly was not a credible threat here. To take the major step of strip searching someone is a HUGE violation of privacy rights. It 's one thing to pull someone off of a plane, pat them down, question them, even check their background through reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone. And, by the way, caselaw does not consider 6 hours to be a " limited period of time " when that time involves holding one 's urination and being subjected to a strip search. If you do n't understand how describing a strip search to merely " suck " is not only offensive to the lady who endured it but also offensive to the Founding Fathers( one of their top priorities in the Constitution was to free citizens from unwarranted searches and seizures ; check out the Federalist Papers &; see how much of the discussion is dedicated to this one issue), why do n't you have a stranger jab his/her hands in every hole of your body as you stand hoping that the camera nearby has not recorded the ordeal. Oh, and be sure to try to hold you pee while you do it. <h> Ca n't Stand Idiots <p> Actually, being held is a " seizure " under the Constitution, and is not allowed " without probable cause. " There was absolutely NO probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen whose only " crime " was to use the restroom coincidentally at the same time. The U.S. Supreme Court has already held that portions of the Patriot Act ARE unconstitutional. Our founding forefathers must be spinning in their graves. <h> Irish <p> Tom, break out your copy of the constitution... Well, with comments like these, you might have not seen it except for that week you saw it in your high school studies. *sigh* The constitution and the Bill of rights was trampled on during this. You are free to move about the country feeling secure that your person, papers, and home will not be subjected to search or seizure without a warrant being issued upon a sworn affidavit from your accuser. No arrest can be made without charges described in the warrant. Terms like " Exigent Circumstances " are being thrown around here and it saddens me. No one was in imminent danger that was observed by the arresting authority, so that is out... " officer safety " was in no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane, so a " Terry stop " was all that was needed here. There was no evidence of probable cause found in their seats, on their person, or in the bathrooms by officers, Flight attendants, or passengers. Further detention, searching, strip searching, and questioning without a warrant would be unconstitutional... An informed, educated and aware population would have never let America slip this far from the path... <h> Authority <p> Allison, there have not been hundreds, there have been so much more. There is nothing to quote because the " authorities " do not make every attempt public. Just like they do n't make every murder, rape, etc. public either. Do n't you think they know how much more fear that would cause? If you would like proof, go to the nearest police station and ask to see their stats. Then imagine that throughout every city in every state around the country. You seem intelligent. Do not assume you know everything and do not assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do make every murder, rape, and every other crime committed in the U.S. public. They have to. All crimes investigated, all arrests made, and all court documents are public record. In certain crimes, names of victims are not reported in the news to attempt to protect those victims, and juveniles are not generally named because they are n't of age or being tried as adults. Just because people do n't pay attention to the reports, or because it 's not front page news, does not mean all criminial activity is not public record. The problem with what happened to the author and many others who are detained is that detention is not an arrest. It is not public record because there is no real paperwork inovolved if they are n't actually arrested. The authorities, whichever variety of authority they are, can detain anyone they like, for any " suspicious " behavior, real or imagined. That is where our laws fail us as citizens. We have allowed our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Americans feel it is worth giving up some of their rights to feel " protected. " There is no measure that will fully protect you from all the dangers you can imagine and all that exist if your government and its agencies are among those dangers. <h> Allison <h> BB <p> Flying is not a right. If you do n't agree to the security procedures, then stop complaining and drive. <p> As for what Authority said, he is absolutely right. The government has stopped many terrorist plots,( such as the Seattle Recruiting Station shooters, or the Times Square bombing plot), doing what they are doing now. There are many more that none of us know about. Its a dirty job, but I 'd rather be patted down in airport security than be on a plane thats going to crash into a building. <p> Again, flying is n't a right. Its a privilege. Drive if you want to complain. <h> Jeanine <p> ' Authority ' you seem to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our government( of which these hapless TSA and FBI morons are a sorry part) -- IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. I do not know ' everything ' but I do know the difference between JUSTICE and FASCISM. Like far too many public officials you would have us ' shut up and obey. ' To you I would say if you like dictatorships then move to Saudi. <h> David Alison <h> Anne <p> Excellent response. I personally have to endure " pat-downs " each and everytime I fly as I have a prosthetic hip. I am blonde and blue-eyed, smiling and friendly toward all TSA, yet I am subjected to being handled, literally, before getting on any flight. No one will ever convince me that this makes anyone on the plane I am about to board any safer. It 's smoke and mirrors. I have no recourse.... if I want to fly, I MUST allow this. Yes, America is a changed country since 9/11, but as several have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary as we find case after case of non-common-sensical searches occurring. Blanket approaches to solving most any problem in life rarely work well. We are Americans. We are suppose to be free to pursue life, liberty and happiness. I am tired of the unspoken idea that I may be a criminal because my body causes a machine to beep. It 's a machine, and I am a human being, deserving rights afforded to me by my Maker. The US Constitution affords me rights as a citizen. When will someone come along that has the insight to see where the line is to be drawn in order to provide security for all of us, and detect with some degree of certainty the people who would attempt to destroy our peace of mind? <h> Joe Jericho <p> He ca n't provide the example. TSA has n't found one terrorist since it was created and has n't thwarted one thing. Sure, the found the underwear bomber -- after the fact, and it was n't TSA who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived the Towers going down. My Aunt and Uncle have lived in Manhattan for 40 years and my Uncle was running through a subway tunnel getting away from the fallen towers. But, if someone was in the tower that day and got out, I will give them a pass on any comment they make regarding this. It 's just too personal for them. I 'm sure some of these people probably wanted to nuke Afghanistan, etc. You just got ta let it pass. <h> zirjo <p> You say we remain safe because of things like this happening. When has there been any threat thwarted because of an unsubstantiated report of " suspicious " activity? There have been threats averted because of diligent work by government officials, but all I see with these overreactive paranoid people is them apologizing in the end and basically saying " No hard feelings. " Then people who do n't have dark skin say they would gladly go through the situation if it meant they were safer. Wow, maybe that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat down! And you think THAT is humiliating! Just take the time to imagine being carted off in handcuffs and thrown into jail, even though you have done NOTHING and ARE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN! Even though this story was publicized, there are still people out there who 1-think maybe she did do something, or 2-at the very least she delayed whatever they were doing that day and incomvenienced THEM. But, hey, no harm, no foul, right? <p> The truth is, being in a criminal justice program and sitting through classes on public administration, not every single " unsubstantiated report of " suspicious " activity " is looked into, but in situations where the country is on max alert because of threats from Al Qaeda( Starr, Ahlers, Jansen, 2011) then the common belief throughout the government is some people should have to sacrifice their rights if a suspicious act is perceived. I would normally strongly disagree with people having to sacrifice their rights but if there is already a perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report cam from the crew( Elizabeth Chuck), and was most likely perceived because it came from the crew as viable enough of a report to react to. I 'm sorry that Hebshi and the two Indian men felt violated but i would like to think that if I was in the same situation I would accept it, but that might just be because I am biased and want to go into a government job after graduation. <p> That the report came from the flight crew( a point I suggested was more credible up above before I read this post) does n't change the analysis of the situation, except that it shows the training of flight crews needs some tweaking. <p> The fear people express about being secretly accused has to be factored in with any fear of terrorist attacks. For the author of this post, informing not terrorism was the source of terror. It is reassuring, in one way, that it was a flight crew person who made the report, because one can assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what suspicious activity might look like on a plane, although that does n't make them immune to racism or tendencies to racially profile, etc. So the only material change that this piece of information introduces is that it demonstrates that official bodies may be likely( and probably should be likely) to respond more to " more qualified reports ". If official bodies respond to someone who is right 98% of the time, that reduces false positives tremendously, as opposed to leaving it up to fear-riddled passengers who are, literally, just guessing. <p> This does n't address issues of racial profiling, etc., but it points to a way to have workably enhanced surveillance( which is not the same thing as saying greater safety) without subjecting people to what turns out to be unnecessary unpleasantness. I hope that no one has lost sight of the fact that the author has, by these acts against her, been subjected to terrorism. It is an act of terrorism( State-sponsored) for authoritarian bodies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if they 're guilty). It is a display of force that leaves an impression, quite apart from whatever excuses or justifications we( or anyone) wants to offer about necessary security and whatnot. That is, it may be security AND it is terror at the same time. It is terror that extends to her children, as a story, to her friends, as an experience she relates. It comes with anger as well, of course, but the perfectly rational response " I wo n't fly on 9/11 anymore " belies the traces of violence done to this woman. <p> I propose in the case of all false positives that the accuser minimally should have to be confronted by the accused. Anonymous reporting can not be allowed in cases of what turn out to be false positives. People should know when they make mistakes, and if those mistakes are racially motivated( then they 're not mistakes, but acts of terror themselves), then being shamed for those mistakes is not inappropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower 1 : RELINQUISHING YOUR RIGHTS TO DIGNITY AND DUE PROCESS DOES NOT MAKE YOU SAFE. IT ONLY MAKES YOU A TARGET FOR FASCISTS. I suspect that neither one of you looks like the targeted racial groups. You would rather live in a ' safe ' prison ' than a free society? 9/11 was horrendous, but it was a sneak attack. There is no rational way to be 1005 ' safe. ' All we can do is use some reasonable awareness. As for ' survivor of tower 1? : how do we know you are who you say you are? You could just as likely be a troll working for the RACIST BIGOTS IN THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE TRUE TRAITORS ARE THE AUTHORS OF THESE LAWS -- PATRIOT AND SO ON. NOTICE HOW NOBODY PROFILES WHITE CHRISTIAN MALES AFTER TIMOTHY MCVEIGH MURDERED HUNDREDS. Frankly, Jeanne, your prejudice and blindness to privilege is showing. <h> marc <p> Think of the northern civil rights campaigners of the 60? s. Going south for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does your government need to make you feel? Not everybody can have their courage but everybody needs some. <h> Carol <p> I feel badly that this has happened to you because of your skin color. Unfortunately, people profile all the time. It can be ecause of skin color, or speech accent, or because they are fat. My friend is constantly looked down on because he does n't have a " job " and he is Native American. He is a very well known artist but that does n't seem to ' count '. I am overweight and I am profiled constantly. Everyone, even doctors, have a tendency to think people become fat because of over eating In my case, it is because my body does not make enough Human Growth Hormone. I ca n't fix it because athletes and others have abused it so there is no insurance company anywhere that will cover the high cost. I think we are all at fault because of our fears, our hate and our inability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your comments 100%. Today a friend of mine wrote on facebook that her prosthetic breast was swabed for explosives. My doctore explained to me that he will never go through the x-ray machines if he is selected for an enhanced search. He explained to me that exposure to radiation is cumulative and back scatter x-rays are more dangerous than a regular x-ray of your arm or lungs because those x-rays are pinpointed. Back Scatter x-rays do exactly that, they scatter radiation all over your body. With all of the negative publicity, you would think that the police would use some common sense in the way that they conducted themselves. What happend to this lady was outragious. Thanks again for your comments Allison <h> julianna <p> This was not a violation of her constitutional rights. As a travelor in the post 9/11 world we live in, we all have the right to be safe. If you do n't like what is happening, drive to your destination. I am so tired of people complaining about civil liberties being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip or even if it was just someone profiling, and there was an explosion or another accident, we all would have been screaming that they did n't do enough to thwart another attack. You ca n't have it both ways. I say profile away. As an American you must understand this... period!!! We did n't do this to ourselves... those cowards on 9/11/2001 did this. We just have to try and make sure it does n't happen again and if that means some blogger from Ohio.... some Father from Virginia..... Some grandmother from Florida... some child from California gets profiled and detained... so be it. This country can not handle another attack and neither can I!!! <p> No. No, we do n't. " Being safe " is not a right. And if " being safe " is that important to you, then I trust you do n't drive a car( thousands of people die EACH! YEAR!), or send your child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molesting children). And I 'm sure you do n't buy food from the grocery store, with all the reports of e. coli contamination that happen every year. <p> You may be tired of people " whining " about their civil liberties being violated ; I 'm tired of people using Orwell as a social blueprint. <p> You may be unable to " handle " another such attack on US soil ; but if so that 's not my problem. There have been attacks on US soil before, and there will be again, at some point. I will point out, thou9.gh, that at some point between 9/11/01 and that next attack, you 're probably going to be dead. <p> Heart attack, cancer, car wreck, falling down the stairs, an allergic reaction to some medication, maybe even a spider bite. Drowning, perhaps. All of these things are MUCH more likely to happen to you than another 9/11 type event occurring. If the government ca n't keep you " safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes you think they can keep you " safe " from an event that is statistically so astronomically rare as a terrorist bombing in this country? <p> Actually, for someone who does n't want another 9/11, you are committing a micro-version of it in this post. Your words are an attempt to terrorize, to suggest that my civil rights should be violated, removed. You say I must understand this -- or else? Is that it? <p> I 'm smart enough, or reflective enough, to know that if I spend every day living in fear, then every day of my life is screwed-off. I 'd rather be scared at those times when I need to be. I was sitting in a cafe one day, and this guy came in, and I had a very strong, visceral reaction that I needed to be somewhere else. I did n't " report him " I just left, feeling ridiculous that I was, but also knowing I 'd feel even more ridiculous if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened. This was probably not my finest hour, but I do n't spend all of my time being paranoid about people -- that 's just dumb to do to myself. <p> Your words frightten me. Your words are the kind that countries I would n't want to live in encourage and promote. If I was elsewhere, I could inform on you as a terrorist, and you would be swept away. Case closed. Problem solved. It 's tempting of course. It 's such an easy way to deal with " people we are scared by " -- but is that where we really want to live? Do you? The more reasonable response, of course, is to call for your censorship, but that 's just the same thing -- a more polite, gentler kind of death. Is that what you want? <p> When people say, " If you have a problem with this country, go somewhere else, " my response is, " My problem is with you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stump for US values and the defense of the US, then please at least do n't violate those values in what you want. The very fact that your intemperate remarks will not and should not be taken as an input to the crafting of any security policy, though the fear and concern in your voice would be taken into account, is a testimony to what part of the US is good in how it functions. Racists want to lynch people of color ; they 're generally ignored. Men want to beat women ; they 're generally punished. You want a fascist government ; no thanks. You will find friends in politics to back you up and who will try to implement what you want, but luckily most of them are just lying to you that that 's what they 're doing, and really they 're just making sure they can line their pockets more with moolah, using your terror to ensure their reelection and the income stream coming to them through the department of defense and the prison-industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being frightened like you are. <h> Joe Jericho <p> This is right. The fact of the matter is that not everyone is awake yet. I guess it is ok to do this until it is done to you, a family member or a friend. I do n't roll like that. The Police State is violating all of our Constitutional rights, especially at the airport. While I realize that we do n't have the full plethora of rights that we get outside the airport, per Supreme Court jurisprudence, there is still no doubt that our 1st, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendment rights are being violated at times by certain people( TSA). I 'd rather drive across the country at this point than subject myself to this kind of government intrusion in my life. I doubt that I politically agree with the blog owner about much. After all, she virtuously cited to Malcom X of all people. But still, I stand with her in her right to be free of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government. Today it is her. Tomorrow, it is all of us. <h> SilenceDogood <p> Every one seems to understand that being secure is not easy and a threat real or imagined on a day when the perpetraitors vowed to attack again must be acknowledged and dealt with period. It just so happened that the author of the blog fits the so called profile. They were all sitting together and not related or even familiar. Odd seat selection? Last thing, the fat Jada Pinkett remark hit two groups of people with one stone Blacks and overweight people. The buzz cut white guy who looked like the police another questionable description of human beings. If you do n't want to be subjected to discrimination and profiling find a better way to describe other human beings. I am not saying whether the reaction was appropriate? however the description of hardworking foot soldiers of American Security on 9/11 leaves a lot to think about. <h> Blanche <p> Carol : Your remark was timely as the author, herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jada Pinkett Smith ". I think she could have chosen another descriptive adjective but she chose a word that, as we all know, signifies contempt of an individual 's physical appearance, no matter what the reason. So, we should ALL be aware of how we treat others and the way we want to be treated and what we say. On the same note, what happened to her was reprehensible but African-Americans have been profiled for decades and experienced far, far worse( try lynching). I wonder how many times Ms. Shebshi experienced indignation when she saw other people of color experience events similar to her own and felt compelled to speak out? In no way are my comments meant to demean Ms. Shebshi. She is correct to speak out but please not to forget that there were many people before you right here in their own country who were n't even allowed to express their righteous indignation the way Ms. Shebshi has. <p> Russ, I congratulate you on they way you expressed your views if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the situation was genuine, including the descriptions of the officers. I believe she was allowing herself to express, honestly, what she was thinking and feeling. It seems to me that America has still not come to grips with it 's ethnicity. We still hear of a crime and hope silently that the criminal can in no way be linked to us either by race, ethnicity or color. When we get to the point where it is okay to say( for descriptive purposes only) that a person of a particular ethnicity IS that ethnicity without it sounding racist, we will be on the road to evolution. When people try to describe me without using my ethnicity or race, it makes it quite difficult for someone to envision who I may be but as soon as someone says the ethnicity/race woman who was on the elevator, for example, there is a way to identify me accurately. In Shoshana 's instance, though, her " look " is neither her race nor ethnicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you have dark, straight hair and light-brown skin, we Americans have not found an identifier for you yet. As this is America, THE melting pot, throw in long, silky, curly dark hair with dark-brown skin and we are once again befuddled. <p> Homeland Security and the FBI did exactly as they should. They were respectful and thorough. I have been through the same type of search TWICE. once returning from Mexico and again returning from Canada, Because I 'd done nothing wrong, I was not concerned. <h> Allison <p> No, we do not need to accept the random violation of a person 's Constitutional rights based on unsubstantiated reports of unspecified suspicious activity from untrained civilians who are not questions about the veracity of their suspicions. <h> Susan <p> Allison, there is nothing ' random ' about flying on a plane on the the 10th anniversay of 9/11. And when somebody calls the authorities to report what they perceive as a threat, the authorities simply follow protocol. Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately some more than others. That 's what happens when hijackers take over planes and kill THOUSANDS of innocent people! <h> Allison <p> Yes, there is. Not everyone can plan their travel plans in order to avoid a specific date. And you 'll notice that not every single person flying on 9/11 was handcuffed, detained, strip searched, cavity searched, and interrogated, which according to your logic they should have been, simply for flying on 9/11? <p> The protocol, in this case, is bullshit. An unknown and untrained civilian, operating under who knows what, can notify authorities of his or her " suspicions " of another passenger, and the authorities take that unsubstantiated report without investigating the validity of it? Really? So, if I call in a report to DSS that you 're beating your kids, the DSS authorities should take that report without asking me any questions about why I 'm making it, what I 've seen and witnessed, what I suspect, etc., and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the equivalent of what happened here. And I really do n't think you want that. <p> Hijackers on 9/11/01 killed thousands of people. Ms. Shebshi is not related in any way to that event. <h> Tina <p> Maybe i 'm wrong, but I do n't recall her mentioning a cavity search. A strip search is far different than a cavity search, just saying. <p> And yes, each and every claim of child abuse should be investigated, but the " equivalent " of this situation would be them coming to your home, asking you questions, looking through your house, looking on your child for bruises, seeing the claims were incorrect apologizing and leaving your home. <p> Having yourself detained for questioning is n't the same as having a child ripped out of your home on unsubstantiated claims. And who said they DID N'T ask the person these questions, and the person answered with specific examples describing her concerns? Two men leaving at the same time to use the bathroom( could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ignoring everybody while texting on her phone( could be somebody contacting a person arranging the terrorist plot). <p> It 's hard to put yourself in somebodys shoes, but it 's very easy to judge them for the feelings they had and choices they made. <h> Minuialear <p> The equivalent would be taking the children away for questioning( without explaining why they are being taken away), as well as doing a thorough search of your house, after which point they finally tell you that a neighbor said she heard you yelling and assumed there was some sort of abuse. <p> This incident was n't a friendly " We 're just going to ask you some questions " sort of affair. Police with machine guns marched into the plane, handcuffed three people, dragged them off to a detention center without a word about what was going on, left them locked up for hours, questioned them about everything under the sun, strip searched them, and then explained the situation. The fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 'd been asking them what the deal was for hours was indicative of the sort of respect she was given AS A CITIZEN, and that ought to disgust anyone. <p> As for the claims themselves, I sincerely doubt those two men were the only men who used the bathroom in succession, and I sincerely doubt she was the only person texting or using her cellphone once the plane landed, so that is bullshit. This event reeks of racial profiling, and her treatment is inexcusable given the scant reasons for suspicion that were reported. <h> SB <h> nonegiven <p> " " equivalent " of this situation would be them coming to your home, asking you questions, looking through your house, looking on your child for bruises, seeing the claims were incorrect apologizing and leaving your home. " <p> Wrong, if a social worker comes to your door wanting to investigate a report of child abuse, even accompanied by a uniformed police officer, you are not required to let them in, speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You ask if they have a warrant or court order, if they do n't then you tell them to go away. <h> Charls Martel <p> The validity of a report is verified in this manner. Tey could have also stormed the plane and shot the suspects, but that would be what you are describing. Your comment about DSS follows the same logic as the previous one. <p> The claim was made, the claim was verified. <p> By continuing with your logic we could say that only 100 percent verified claims are to be investigates or confronted? who is then responsable for the inital tip? can only a trained indevidual classify someone as suspicious and give a report to be followed up on? <p> thought problem : 3 personell on a plane have explosives hidden on their persons. a report was made as to these 3 suspicious indeviduals. how would this report be verified? any different from the above story? <p> On another vein, I am just curious as to what actions here violated someones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether and how a person 's rights were violated here? Our protagonist, a law-abiding citizen on the way to see her law-abiding husband, was detained for hours on an unsubstantiated decision and strip-searched. The Fourth Amendment says that you have the right to be guarded against unreasonable searches and seizures. How do you define " reasonable "? Does relying on the unfounded, unverified, unsubstantiated accusation of a random stranger who 's a bit racist and paranoid really strike you as " reasonable "? <h> Duane <p> Allison, I have to agree with you 100%. The simple fact is, the current " protocols " would not stop an intelligent, trained and determined terrorist anyway -- maybe a crazed nutcase, but that 's about it. The " protocls " that existed on 9/11 SHOULD have stopped most of the hijackings then -- but they did n't. What was missing then is the same thing that is stil missing now -- common sense. Without that, no protocol on Earth will work. <p> And personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and limb -- which means that they are worth taking risks for. I would not want " perfect " security if it meant giving up my freedom. Inconvenience, sure. True freedom, no. When we do that out of fear, then the terrorists win. <h> A realist <p> Youre rational is very selfish. Although this poor woman and the two men had to go through this ordeal for what turned out to be no reason, safety is still important to the other civilians and US citizens on the plane. Our government and its the entities working for it are there to keep you, me, and this Lady safe from a real threat of death and terrorist actions. This is the world that we live in. We can not just forget... to substantiate a claim now-a-days on a bomb threat is a 50-50 shot at suicide. Like it or not, this is the world we live in. This is the result of evil pockets of terror making life harder for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lay out in your comments. Our world is changed, and cooperation to prevent another 3000 deaths is a small sacrifice for the greater good. <h> Allison <h> Joe Jericho <p> Realist, please tell me where the real threat of death was on that flight? I am sure you will be able to quickly articulate it. Or are you suggesting that there is a real threat of death everytime a plane takes off in this world? I will grant you that a plane can crash, but I can get in a crash pulling out of my driveway in the morning. Please explain yourself. <h> Joe <p> Susan, We also have Inalienable rights as citizens of this great nation. We have 4th Amendment rights that guarantee us freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. What was done was a complete violation of this woman 's Constitutional Rights! I do n't remember the quote of Benjamin Franklin exactly, but it went something like this ' Those who are willing to give up their Liberty for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have TSA, FBI and Police Officers who are abusing their power we have in fact ALLOWED the terrorists to win. By the way, I have spent the last 35 years of my life in Law Enforcement and I believe the manner that LE 's conducted themselves in this situation and many others is outragiously wrong. <p> Susan, do you mean to say, brown people should " deliberately " not fly on 9/11, because there flying can not be perceived as random? Random work, random visit to somebody ailing, random visit to a wife or a girlfriend who was unlucky to be born on 9/11 years before the incident? <h> Joe Jericho <h> Anthony <p> I 'd rather my plane explode than be subjected to this tyranny. Good thing I moved out of the fascist United States. I 'm really worried about when I have to go back and visit my family. I wo n't answer any questions, hold me in the cell. Government thug scumbags, the whole lot of them are. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with Allison. We do not have to accept violations of our rights. Rational minds need to prevail. I 'm sick of hearing the old " if I did n't do anything wrong I do n't have to be afraid " argument. What if Shoshana had been with her kids? What if she was on her way to visit her dying father? A six-hour or more delay with no cause is not harmless. This is America. We prize our freedom. <h> Jim <p> America does n't have " an ethnicity ". We are a melting pot of people from all over the world. We are a nation of immigrants and natives, people of all nations who have come here to make their lives. The concept that someone thinks we have " an american ethnicity " is so repugnant that it 's not even funny. Shoshana, I for one, as a fellow American Citizen, apologize to you for what you suffered. You handled it with much more dignity than I would have. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope. Thank you for that. <h> Marnie <p> If we accepted that unfair and inhumane treatment by anyone or towards anyone -- including the government -- was inevitable, we 'd still be in the 1700? s. Do n't you have any sense of pride in the essence of what it means to be American, with not only the right, but the duty to stand up and speak out against injustices? Complacency and laziness is the antithesis of the American Dream, and will lead to the rotting of our way of life from the inside out -- a situation many times worse than what anyone else can do to us, but exactly what they wish they could do. But in that case, they have n't won -- we forfeited. Truly, ignorance is not bliss -- it is a path to destruction. <p> We need to figure out a way to rise above these issues that separate us, and unite as citizens, to fight for the values that this country was built upon, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to speak up, and make our voices heard. We need to stop allowing the politicians to run our country on their own personal platforms, and really start taking back our power. <p> Shoshana, I am so sorry that you endured this treatment... I can only hope that you can find the strength and love in your heart to forgive -- for your own peace of mind -- and that your story might be able to make a difference, inspiring more people to stand up and speak out for the freedoms we obviously need to take more responsibility for maintaining, lest we lose them while we 're not looking. <p> You can go through life as someone who allows government to infringe upon your constitutional rights by simply saying this is a " way of life " and we need to accept if you like. However, that kind of attitude will take us down a road towards tyranny, and I would not want to see that. <p> No, the FBI and Homeland Security did not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are based on fear and ignorance and do nothing to further protect us. This is no different than TSA agents groping an 85 year old or even a young child. <p> As Benjamin Franklin said -- " They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor safety. " <h> Dave in SB <p> Shelly Are you #@* &ing; kidding??? This is a way of life now?? Accept it?? Our founding fathers felt that a free people were not meant to be subject to this kind of arbitrary crap and that is a great part what made this country great, in the first place. Sadly, people like you are handing over our rights and freedoms, for your illusory sense of safety, such that someday we will just have fond memories of the freedoms our founding fathers gave us through the Constitution!!! <h> ruth <p> Shelly -- I do n't have to accept anyone sticking their fingers in my vagina and butthole because of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not. It 's a violation and our Constitution protects against it for better reasons than the current fear. It does nothing in this case to ensure national security. What it does is set a precedent for those with some type of authority to do it to you because someone reported something " suspicious. " And eventually that person making a report could be your neighbor that has a petty disagreement with you and goes extreme or someone who just disagrees with your political beliefs. I 've already had this type of situation occur with me post-9/11 and Patriot Act, and no, it did nothing to further your security or anyone else 's. But it did a whole lot to violate my sense of personal security and safety, which is what is seems to have done in this case. <h> Thomas Hamilton <p> I agree, the system needs to be fine tone, but i rather have to go through a slight inconvenienced than to have 50 to 60,000 people lose their lives, because the system was being politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blair <p> Charls, I think that there is a right to protection from unlawful search and seizure, which is the basis for the requirement for probable cause. It looks to me like this is the chief violation of Mrs. Shebshi 's liberties. <h> Joe Jericho <p> Quite easily the 4th Amendment. Unlawful seizure and unreasonable search. Geez. As for Hamilton, I agree with Allison a strip search and a possible cavity search was not a slight inconvenience to her. This just speaks to the self-centered nature of our society. Maybe your real thought is " F her ".???? <h> I support Rationality <h> BB <p> Due to the Patriot Act and our post 9/11 world, her search and seizure was not " unreasonable ". There was probable cause. It was 9/11, and there was chatter of a chance that terrorists would retaliate. DHS and FBI followed procedure, which was given to them in the PATRIOT ACT. <p> Also, the 6th Amendment only applies in criminal defendants. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accused of being a terrorist. She was detained and questioned due to what people deemed suspicious activity on a day where there was a threat of terrorism. <h> SilenceDogood <p> And the probably cause was what, exactly? It was either a) that she is brown or b) she is brown and was sitting in a row with other brown people or c) she is brown and was sitting in a row with other brown people who also used the restroom. <p> Egads! I had no idea that terrorists also use the restroom! Well, I for one will now be reporting everyone I see on a plane using a restroom. Ca n't be too careful, you know. After all it is a post 9/11 world and people using the restroom need to be strip searched! <p> Seriously, BB, if you are this afraid of 9/11 attacks, you just should n't leave your house. Seriously. You are more likely to choke and die on a peanut than you are to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, et. al. -- The law is very clear and nobody 's rights were violated. <p> The fourth amendment was not violated in that the report presented " exigent circumstance " that made the search legally valid. <p> The fifth amendment was also not violated in that no one was " held to answer " a term with very specific meaning referring. I quote, " A preliminary hearing is held to determine if there is sufficient evidence that the defendant committed the crime and should therefore be " held over " for trial. Once a defendant is " held to answer, " meaning in custody to answer charges, the prosecuting agency files a document called the Information. The defendant will subsequently be arraigned on the Information at which time he or she will enter a plea and proceed to trial. " http : **35;5740;TOOLONG... <p> The sixth amendment was never at risk as it has to do exclusively with criminal prosecutions and rights at trial. Since no one was " held over ", and no indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a right to face the accuser. Such a " right " does n't exist. <h> Brian <p> You talk to much. It 's not a " right " to fly. If you do, you follow the rules which are in place to make it as safe as possible. If you do n't like it, take the bus. And yes, it is sorry to say, that sometimes the color of someone 's skin causes more alarm than someone 's else skin color, but once again, deal with it. If you do n't like it, then move some place else where you feel safer. I would have reported it too. As a matter of fact I would have been on high alert for anything, anything at all which might seem a little odd. Including everytime you reached into your bag while they were in the bathroom. <h> Dan from NYC <p> As with all rights there is a limitation. Flying is a limited right not an unlimited one. Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( b) Use of Airspace. --( 1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke an assignment when required in the public interest.( 2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft( including regulations on safe altitudes) for --( A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft ;( B) protecting individuals and property on the ground ; " <h> SilenceDogood <p> And just exactly how is strip and cavity searching someone AFTER the plane has landed SAFELY at its INTENDED FINAL DESTINATION allow for protection of individuals and property on the ground when the flight was safely completed as intended? <p> How, exactly, does that work with your incorrect reading of the law? <h> BayAreaBiker <p> Another bigot comment. It would have saved rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment too so that I could avoid sitting next to you if we happen to be on same flight or at the airport. <h> anonymous <h> Mark <p> No, Thomas Hamilton... nobody should have to go through a " slight inconvenience " just because we are bombing the hell out of the Middle East. It 's not worth it. It starts with 1 person being inconvenienced, then 2, then 10, then 1,000, then 100,000 then we are putting people of certain ethnic background into camps. Fascism will come to America wrapped in an American flag. You need to foresee the bigger picture when you say things like that, Thomas. <p> Not one person should ever have to go through what Ms.Shebshi went through. <h> James Jesse <h> David <p> Are we really at WAR? We 've been battling a war on drugs for over 40 years and spent over $2.5 trillion dollars on it, yet have drugs been eliminated from our society? Not even remotely. <p> We 've been fighting a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time and it will continue to exist into the future. Our individual freedoms and liberty are being compromised for the sake of fighting this war. At what point do we say " enough "? <p> Using the " we are at WAR " excuse is a convenient way to justify virtually any attack on the personal liberties that we in the US hold so dear in the first place. Whether it 's illegal wire tapping, unlawful detention or progressively unreasonable searches, we as a people are letting our freedoms erode in the interest of safety. <p> And just for some perspective, bask in these numbers. From 1994 to 2010 here are the number of people killed in the US from two different sources : <h> Libby <h> Donna <p> Why is it necessary to resort to this type of name-calling when Russ asked for a middle ground, a fine tuning of a system that makes mistakes? I was annoyed to remove the knitted booties off of my 3 month old child at airport security, and would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna name calling only shows your ignorance. It 's not at all becoming. It is certainly your right to disagree with someone else 's viewpoint ; however, your behavior of name calling has no benefit at all and simply makes you look and sound ignorant. <h> Dave <h> Ken <h> Marnie <p> Come on now, Donna... That is truly dangerous language, and even more un-American than anything he said. We each have the freedom to maintain, and voice our opinions ; and frankly, this comment indicates to me that you are not only probably less intelligent than he, but also morally deficient. Congratulations! <h> Si <p> Donna, that was a pretty nasty comment. He did n't say anything wrong, just his opinion, and all you have is slander. As far as what happened, do I think she was violated and humiliated? Absolutely! But the catch 22 is unfortunately, if you see something that looks a bit odd and it is a day where everyone is especially on guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the possibility it might a real threat, or do you go for help? I do believe there was a better way to handle this and allay fears without putting this poor woman and those other 2 men in handcuffs, but I do n't have the answer as to how. To those that claim there was nothing suspicious about those men going to the bathroom, you were n't there, and you can only really see this story from her perspective. It might have looked odd to the crew for two men, sitting close together, and of the same ethnicity to get up and go to the bathroom at the same time and then take a bit longer than normal. The fact is we had warnings of the original 9/11 and we ignored them. Well people are n't ignoring it anymore. There were other indicators of possible attacks on the anniversary, should we ignore those too? We are the only country with the kind of freedoms that we have, and we should n't let others change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the other side is that because we have these freedoms, we are also a very easy target. So how do we balance this, so we maintain our American ways, respect our rights, and still be protected? It is a very difficult balancing act. I was in the military during 9/11 and was an Arabic linguist/analyst and it was very difficult then to make good decisions. It is a very convoluted situation. Who attacked us on 9/11?... extremists who happened to be of Arab descent. So who do we look at to attack us again... those of Arab descent. Are there other terrorists of other nationalities? Of course there are, and we should always be alert, but the fact is that there was not a single terrorist attacker on 9/11 who was not an Arab. Please understand, I am not saying anyone was wrong, I feel for this poor woman, but I also understand why things happened as they did. Instead of simply saying that people acted inappropriately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pointing the finger is a waste of time and does n't get to the heart of the problem. To Mrs Hebshi, I am so sorry that you were put through that. I ca n't imagine what you must be feeling and I hope that you can find some peace. <h> WE DARE <h> wri7913 <p> Your comment only shows how vulgar and idiotic you are. Nothing more. As Russ said, and I concur, I am glad there is a system in place to report incidences but obviously it does need to be refined. People also need to be vigilant but not overactive in their fears. People like Shoshana need to be more aware of their activities especially on a day like 9/11 while flying. People 's fears will obviously be heightened due to possible followup terrorists strike. It has n't happened yet but the Press was making references to the Government 's heightened state of alert due to a possible strike. <p> Are people of Arabic descent going to be profiled on planes? You bet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( in the last 50 years) of airline terrorism. Sorry but that is the honest truth here. <h> M <p> wri7913 says, " People like Shoshana need to be more aware of their activities especially on a day like 9/11 while flying. " <p> Who exactly are " people like Shoshana? " Women? Ohio residents? People who are half Arab? People who are half Jewish? What if you 're 1/4 something? 1/8? What if you 're 100% Indian and the only thing you have in common with Shoshana is that you 're not white? <p> And what exactly were her activities? Reading? What can and ca n't she read? Sleeping? What if I can never sleep on a plane? Playing with her phone? Are some games ok but others not? Texting while on the ground -- can I do that if I 'm brown even if the captain says it 's ok to turn on cell phones? How many white people around me need to be using electronic equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? <h> Tony S <p> I think that you and others are missing/ignoring some important points. <p> First, while there needs to be a way to report suspicious activities, the response to such a report should be a reasonable one. What Mrs. Shebshi, and her two fellow travelers were subjected to was not reasonable. <p> Second, please remember that our Constitution is the foundation and the framework for all of our laws, If those laws fail to protect all of our people, then we have a problem that needs to be addressed. As Allison pointed out earlier, the 4th Amendment was probably violated. Mrs. Shebshi was forcibly detained and restrained based on someone reporting " suspicious activity ", Does anyone remember the major details of the Salem witch trials? Women were tortured and killed based upon the accusation that they were a witch. Before I get accused of missing the obvious, I would like to point out the basic parallels. It only took an accusation to have someone detained( ie, locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused were thoroughly interrogated( tortured) before their trial to try to extract a confession. Failing that, the accused was sent before a judge who did one of two things. He either ordered the accused be tested, such as being bound and thrown into a large enough body of water, or, if the testimony were convincing enough, the judge would order the accused to be executed. I 'm not going to beat this one to death, I 'll leave it to you to find the parallels. <p> While I understand and accept the need for investigating reports like this, there are many other ways to respond. Especially that whole ordeal about the strip search! Someone posted that the blog posting said nothing about a body cavity search, and how it was completely different than a strip search. My question, why would you perform a strip search if not to perform a body cavity search? <p> Last, airport security did n't suddenly appear following the events on 9-11. Beginning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial airlines with the intent of monetary/political gain. It was following those incidents that airport security became an issue that mattered to the general public. In addition to this, terrorists began a bloody campaign( mostly in Europe) of random killings to bring attention to whatever cause they were supposedly supporting. <p> Eventually, the terrorists moved there attacks globally, including to the US. Did you know that there were several terrorists attacks on US soil by the Croatian nationalists prior to 9-11 or the breakup of Yugoslavia? They generally did n't do much damage, but still, think you can racially profile them? To accuse people of Arabic descent of being responsible for 50 years of airline terrorism borders on being racist. Making these types of comments without first doing a bit of research does n't provide security, it only reinforces distrust and fear. <p> We all need to stop the rhetoric and start thinking for ourselves. The Republicans are n't going to save us, and neither will the Democrats. Demand real solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all costs ". Not everyone that has dark skin is a terrorist, or sympathetic to terrorists, or, from another country. <p> It seems curious to me that many of the people advocating the stricter searches and diminishing liberties in the name of more security are white. <p> What about the people actually subjected to the searches? <p> I wear a turban. I went to the Mall of America the other day with my mother and sister. I went to see a movie, and two police officers pulled me from the theater. They questioned me. Apparently they received multiple calls from people frightened by me in the mall, and had been following me for a few hours. <p> Who 's really shouldering the cost of this " increased security "? <p> By the way, over the past decade, the number of deaths worldwide at the hands of Islamic Extremists, outside war zones, comes to some 200 to 300 individuals per year. For comparison, during the same period more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States alone. Attributed to a friend. <p> So, bathtubs have in the last decade slightly more dangerous to the American public than islamist terrorism. In addition to the erosion of civil liberties and public relations, the war on terror has cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, mostly civilians. What resources are being used in to preserve bathing security? <h> SB <p> Sarah can not bring herself down to respond to you as you have now provided some corroboration. Of course, she would never have bothered to check, if there is a grain of fact in the post she responded to either. She will conveniently ignore the thread from hereon. <h> SANKAR <p> Are you white? If a white guy points a finger to the dark skinned person especially at the airport or inside an aircraft it will ring the bell all over. If you belong to that race then you would know it. It is not for protection. It is sheer racism intended to divide the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mind of citizens so that all will stay silent although being wiped out due to depression created by the bank racketeers. The biggest terrorism of the century. At this day, terrorism is just a joke but the crooks are still attempting to revive it by spreading fears. Obviously, it is a huge profit making business. <h> eye on the ball <p> SPOT ON! Three cheers for being the first commenter to point this out. Counterterrorism is a MASSIVELY profitable business and it is absolutely in the best interests of many to perpetuate our fears. And it DOES distract us from real abuses carried out by other industries, including profiteering in the financial industry, to keep Americans focused on " Homeland Security " instead of investigating banking crimes. <p> Do people not remember what " Give me liberty or give me death " means? It means our " founding fathers " would rather have been DEAD that be subjected to the kind of treatment this poor woman describes in her blog post. So to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it " in exchange for the " safety " it brings to America -- they need to realize they are in total conflict with the brave people, real patriots, who fought a revolution to bring us this country, and everyone else since them who has fought for civil liberties. <h> Dave <p> Although I agree that it sucks to have to go through this type of thing, I lean toward the fact that it is way better to be safe than sorry. If one has not awakened to the fact that our world is a dangerous place after what happened on 9/11 then one must be asleep at the switch. We, as Americans, have a group of animals out there that care not for their own lives but instead care about how many of us they can kill. All it takes is one of them to get through security and people will die, that is why it is important for all of us to be vigilent and aware of what goes on around us. This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity onboard that aircraft. The sad fact is that the majority of Americans can not tell the difference between someone from India as opposed to someone from Saudi Arabia. Right after 9/11 there was a murder of a sikh man because the guy who shot him thought he was an arab. Americans should be educating themselves about the different peoples living in the middle east/southwest asia so that they can make more informed decisions in their vigilence. That vigilence is a necessary evil that we must live with because we are at war with an ideology. <h> Renee <p> Russ I totally agree with you. Although I feel that the behavior for suspicion was n't there, I do find comfort that in the event a real threat was presented it would be investigated. I agree that she was treated unfairly. However, 10 years ago some suspicions were ignored. And unfortunately we all have to live with the consequences. <p> Questioning you would not eliminate the threat if there was one. It was our inaction of on 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being cautious we are going to fault them as well. Where do you purpose the middle ground lays here, Without all the accusations and conjuncture of profiling, what would be a better solution? Simply questioning you, if you were a terrorist, I am sure you would be completely honest and forthright in your confession as soon as someone pulled you out of line. <p> I have to question anyone 's decision to fly on 9/11, especially since several planes are being escorted by fighter jets, that could misread a sign of trouble mechanically with a terrorism attack and end up badly. <p> Is it racist or bigoted, the case and point could be made either way. If the police suspect me of a felony in another state but have not confirmed that fact, they have a time frame as to which they can hold me in a cell and be lawful. <p> So let 's do what you suggest, Let 's grab some white guys and yank them off the plane, Why? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want everyone to feel like we are singling them out unfairly so we will waste resources and money on a group or people that pose no credible threat right now. <p> Perhaps it was racist, but like everything in life it is not all or nothing, the blame lies with you just as much as it does with the FBI. Your decision to fly on 9/11 being of a certain race, does n't show sound judgment. If not for any other reason but then being target practice for a pilot. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> Thanks for your post Tina. Now I completely understand that it is entirely the victims fault. She should have known that because of her genetic heritage she would not be able to fly on 9/11/2011 without being detained for several hours and strip searched. <p> Are you one of the people who believe that rape would not be a problem if girls stayed out of bad neighborhoods? <p> Your solution is to grab white people of the plane and subject them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a good reason ". Please clarify what the " good reason " was for treating these three people this way. For reference, I will not accept " Your decision to fly on 9/11 being of a certain race " as a " good reason ". <p> I hope that this case goes to court, because I want to see the justification for detaining, strip searching, and questioning three innocent airline passengers. If this is not determined to be a gross violation of the fourth amendment, then nothing will. <p> It 's not a result of terrorism alone. The fear that caused someone to report " suspicious activity " was bred over the next eight years after 9/11, heightened not by terrorist actions but by people in our own homeland. The paranoia of people was selectively targeted, used, and aggravated by political maneuvers, which has left a lot of people with ugly fears about dark-skinned people, particularly of Middle Eastern descent. These people are too simple to have any measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like rats in an electrified cage, and they do what they 're told, whether they 're being told that African-Americans have to go to school with them or whether they 're being told that possible Muslims should be watched carefully in case they 're terrorists. So no, the terrorists did n't cause all of this alone ; a bunch of opportunists did the greatest amount of damage inside our own borders. <p> Shoshana -- if I can presume to call you by your first name, not knowing you -- I 'm terribly sorry that this happened to you, and I 'm terribly glad that you decided to write about it. Information and expression are freedoms we need to cherish. <h> Dave Mowers <p> Perhaps the United States should stop training terrorists and supporting dictatorships in foreign countries then we would n't have people who want to attack us! What was the excuse for shooting the Iraqi family with eight children to death including a newborn and two toddlers, recently brought under investigation? You think their extended family loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people murdered by U.S. supported dictators love our country? Do parents of children dying from cancer caused by depleted uranium in Iraq love us? When your government murders in your name you get terrorist atrocities in return, maybe we should be asking ourselves why it is happening instead of arguing about the reactions to it. <p> ' Inconvenienced ' and ' humiliated '?? She was given a body cavity search! Why do n't you volunteer for one after being dragged of a plane and handcuffed and come back and tell us us " at least there are efforts... to keep us safe ". Puhlease. <h> George Metesky <p> This is completely disgusting. Please accept my apologies on behalf of my lunatic government( and the crazy people in Detroit who did this to you). On Sept. 9th, I was visiting New York City and Penn Station looked like it had been invaded by an attacking army... only it was our own police, in every nook of the station with loaded AK-47s ready to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on an obviously drunk Hispanic man just because he was speaking loudly and obnoxiously( imagine that, in New York City!). Personally, I would rather live in a country where we suffer a terrorist attack every once in a while than in a perfectly safe country where power is abused the way it is currently being done. And this is with a liberal, minority-member President. Just imagine what would happen if we had elected someone scarier and more militaristic? <h> DW <p> While I agree that this is completely disgusting the rest is shortsighted and incorrect. You DO live in a country that suffers terrorist attacks every day. You just do n't see them because they are masked as attacks on our information infrastructure. And they do n't directly cause the loss of life -- they threaten to expose the security infrastructure that your tax dollars pay to maintain. <p> Fly into most any international airport in Europe, or go to a major train station and it 's very commonplace to see the military all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to walk freely with little expectation of death and destruction should be thanking those military personnel for deciding to take on this charge on their own. Last I heard there was no draft forcing them to! <p> And I highly doubt that you really mean you would tolerate a terrorist attack with loss of life occasionally. It would likely take only one bomb going off in your neighborhood, frightening the bejeebeez out of you, or the death of a loved one or friend someplace else to change your opinion. <h> DW <p> You do n't think they are? Seriously? And you know this because... they handed you a flower and chanted the last time you were in Europe? Military presence in major European transportation centers are part of their culture. I saw it as far back as my first trip to England in 1980! <p> Further, I 'd disagree with you about itching for a fight. The very highly trained military people I know are n't interested in shooting people on their own soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are trained and sworn to do : Defend us from enemy 's foreign and domestic. <p> The cause of this incident was n't started by the military. It seems it was a civilian who provided the faulty Intelligence that scrambled jets and caused strip searches. The military simply responded just like they were trained. <p> Again, I 'm sorry and saddened that this happened to her and her seat partners. But if you want to point a finger and find fault, point at the radicals that are n't interested in building anything -- but only tearing things apart at any cost. And then at the highly under-trained " official reporters " who stir themselves into hysteria. If we were living in a hysterical society, we 'd have curfews and be walking around with flak jackets. <p> And lastly, if this was a trained Air Marshall or some other military individual on board that evaluated this situation and made the decision to move forward with this threat, then they need serious retraining -- and maybe a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the same thing. You assume that a police force is ill equipped/trained to protect the law abiding citizens it 's charged to protect. I 'd counter and tell you that a very high percentage of these individuals are former military, and are incredibly well trained. And for the most part well lead. In fact, I 'm related to two highly trained soldiers-turned-police officers who put their life on the line every day. Are there bad apples out there? You bet. But there are bad apples everywhere. Bernie Madoff comes to mind... <p> It 's not perfect, but I 'll take this imperfect government over all the rest. <h> SilenceDogood <p> A well-trained force with bad apples strip and cavity searches innocent people. They also accidentally shoot people once in a while. <p> There is a reason Rome forbade a standing military, and would n't let it parade in the city. When a militarized police force is allowed to occupy a city, it does n't matter how many wonderful people are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's why when Caeser brought a triumphant military through the city the Senate was appalled. They knew what it meant. It meant the end of a free Republic. <h> DW <p> A well-trained force with bad apples strip and cavity searches innocent people.

The British-English influence surfaces! Now I get it! <p> Yes, I concede that accidentally strip searching someone is less deadly that accidentally shooting people once in a while. But neither is acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, shall we? Caeser marched on the city, the Senate was appaled. It was a civil war. Ceaser wanted control, and the senate fled. Is our military at war with our Senate? I do n't think so. And did n't we fight that battle some years ago? Something about Union and Confederate? Hmmm? <h> Brian <p> Agreed. Just yesterday, someone on my Facebook list left a vitriolic comment regarding Muslims. He just can not grasp the difference between Islam and what the radical fundamentalists believed in. It saddens and frightens me that ten years later, we 're still stuck in this rut. <h> laars <h> Mel <p> I do feel pity for you if your actually innoccent, but I am glad extreme measures were used. No offense, but if most of us had it our way, every single middle eastern person would be deported from Canada and the US. Sorry, but amongst the innocent are the terrorists and we just cant tell you apart and thats what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sentiment. Do n't speak for " most of us. " You are in your own body and mind, not others. Speak for yourself. This comes from someone whose parent died doing research to decontaminate and demilitarize chemical and biological agents stockpiled for wars. <h> Abbe Lakenville <h> Theonlypatriothere <p> Let 's get real people. The good of the many outweigh the good of the few. It took what, 6 hours? It was n't pleasant I 'm sure, but get over it people. Had there been a bomb, and had it gone off, you would all be screaming about how poorly our security teams did their jobs! Make no mistake people, THIS is the price of your safety. They took a small amount of your time, they did not harm you, and they did what the situation required. I can understand that a strip search is not exactly pleasant, but I promise, it wo n't kill you. Everyone wants to reap the benifits of being a citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it. You picked your representatives people, time to deal with it. <h> Allison <p> No, we do not need to accept the random violation of a person 's Constitutional rights based on unsubstantiated reports of unspecified suspicious activity from untrained civilians who are not questions about the veracity of their suspicions. <h> Gump <p> Apparently you do. Fact is, Islamic extremists do n't fight war with any appropriate rules of engagement. They fight dirty and cowardly. They sneak around dressed as civilians to kill as many civilians as they can. They are the hardest form of war to fight, and the direct result of that is the difficulty of having to watch the public for signs of suspicious behavior. There are going to be mistakes. I 'd much rather be detained knowing that the gov't is making hard choices to try and keep the plane safe, then for them to avoid racial profiling at all costs because it 's " rude or politically incorrect ", and simply hope that people who come from countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You do n't have proof that they actually stopped you because of your race, it 's just the way you feel because you 're sensitive to it. If I was living in China, and a bunch of white catholic extremists killed 3000 random Chinese people in a day for no other reason than hate, I would be very cognoscente of the fact that I look like them, and would personally go out of my way to make sure they understood I was not the same. I certainly would n't act all high and mighty and exclaim, " How dare they! " I 'd actually feel apologetic and feel embarrassed that people from where I come from have such audacity and ugliness. Just as I do for my ancestors in the time of American slavery. I think you need to stop blaming the U.S. for racial profiling and blame the Islamic extremists for creating this result. There is no other way to fight back and defend against this kind of war. <p> I 've been stopped and searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were done, appreciating that they make sure I get on a safe flight. I 'm happy to be searched, I 'm happy to take off my shoes, and I thank them each and every time. Get on board. <h> Allison <p> Being stopped and searched on an airport check is not the same thing as being taken off of a plane in handcuffs in front of the rest of the passengers, placed in a dirty cell for several hours with no information, strip searched, cavity searched, and interrogated. If you would be fine with that, so what? Others would n't, and that is not only their right, it 's the law under the Constitution of the U.S. That document that is the owner 's manual of the country. <p> Dark-skinned American citizens do not owe anything to white Americans just because they exist. Dark-skinned Americans have the same rights as white Americans, and do not have to kowtow to white American fears. <h> Cheri <p> Allison, did this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Our world is what WE have made it through our self-absorbed attitudes and ungodly living. We get what we deserve... Actually, thank God, we do n't get what we deserve... for it is a lot worse than anything described within these posts. <h> David <p> If i remember correctly there where americans killed on 9/11. Why do you have to have dark skin to feal what everyone is talking? I am a white male who listens to country music and could be called a " REDNECK ".. Does this mean i hate all non-whites? No it does nt, but the stero-type is that i do. Please do nt tell me that because you have a skin color that is not white you should be treated any different than anyone else. This is a case where protocol was used. Sadly what happen on 9/11 did nt not have the proper protocol followed or the planes would have never been hijacked. For all that havent noticed the man who has picked the people to run Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just want to say that you are a hero in this comments section. Every uninformed remark that I have been sufficiently moved to reply to, you have already done so eloquently. Thank you and I laud your passion. <p> For the record, I 'm not an American citizen, not resident in the US, but love the principles your country has been founded on. Pity to see what it has become. <h> Allison <h> Anne <p> By " stopped and searched " do you mean that you were handcuffed, detained, and made to wait to in a dirty cell for hours at time while no one would tell you what was going on or why you 'd been pulled from your flight? No. You mean that you were pulled aside while going through security and they opened up your suitcase and looked through it, looked at your shoes, and then sent you on your merry way. You have no idea what this woman and those two men went through, and it 's stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's talking about. <p> The ignorance of whoever reported them is astounding, but not surprising. What puts the icing on the cake for me, and I think for most of the other people here commenting is the fact that they were treated like common criminals based off of a tip from an untrained civilian who had nothing to support their claim other than, " They all look the same and two of them went to the bathroom close to the same time. " They could have at least told her what was going on, and why she 'd been pulled from the plane instead of ignoring her, or refusing to tell her and treating her like a criminal. Telling her what 's going on does n't jeopardize anything, if she were a terrorist she 'd already know what was going on anyway. They also did n't have to pull them from the plane the way they did. There are better, less humiliating ways to do that. And if you want to defend it, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pull off of planes every year. Show me how many times doing that to people has stopped an actual danger, instead of humiliating innocent people who happen to " look like a terrorist " to the ignorant and racist eye. <p> Her experience was demoralizing, humiliating, and belittling, and until this has happened to you you should probably shut your maw. <p> PS : I think it 's hysterical that you say that she has no proof that she was pulled because of her race. Please, oh wise one, tell me why else someone would assume that three people sitting next to each other doing nothing but sitting would look suspicious to someone. Oh yeah, and also happen to be the same race. That 's just a coincidence right? This happens to Caucasians as well all the time I bet. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> The fact of the matter is, it is all bigotry and racial profiling. The extremists crashed into the towers because they hate Americans. My Japanese friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know many people who hate all Germans due to Hitler. I am of Swedish descent and I dyed my hair black and due to this I got detained when I was picking someone up from the airport. I did n't even get out of my car. Oh, and I was driving a black German car. Or maybe I got profiled because I was driving an expensive car and the poor slob who detained me will never see the inside of a car like mine unless he stops them out of some fabricated notion he has regarding why he stops people. <p> It is all bigotry, pure and simple. <p> Oh, and to Donna and her comment about Russ, " Russ -- Why did so many good people die on 09/11, and an idiot like you survive?? " Probably every person who died on that day would have Russ ' opinion now if they had survived. The fact is no one deserves to die because we do n't agree with their opinion. Chances are due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include some disagreeable people. They still did n't deserve to die. You, Donna, making that comment because his opinion is different than yours is no different than any other person who exhibits hatred due to someone having a different opinion than yours or a different lifestyle, looks different, is of another religious belief, etc. 9/11 happened because those people placed all Americans in a stereotypical fishbowl and because they do n't agree with certain Americans. Racial profiling is exactly the same. Maybe these three people did n't die, but they were tortured due to their ethnicity. <p> All people need to learn more tolerance. Law enforcement need to remember " innocent until proven guilty " and " probable cause. " I hope whoever reported that suspicious activity realizes that 2 fighter jets shadowed their airliner all of the way to the airport. Maybe those reporting suspicious activity also need to be detained and checked out. Are n't most witnesses to crimes checked to see what their motive is or checked for their credibility? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many posters on here currently support the " enhanced security protocols ", solely because of what happened on 9/11. I wonder what will happen the first time those protocols backfire, and result in a tragedy? Will everyone support them so much then, or will people want to go to the opposite extreme? What happened to common sense? <p> In this case, the Airbus was being shadowed by two F-16? s. They were n't there for a parade. If certain of the " protocls " had been breached, that Airbus would have been shot out of the sky. So, what if the planes would hav picked that exact time to experience a major electrical failure? What if the pilots would have needed to do a fly-by for a second approach? What if one of them, being nervous, would have accidentally shuyt down the IFF, made a poor choice in on-air jokes, or done one of the dozens of other major mistakes that happen daily in our skies? Sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to desperately to avoid -- another tragedy. And, in the process, we will give up our Constitutional rights as well. That 's a poor trade, to me. <p> There is a difference between inconvenience and violation of rights. The first we can live with, but not the second. We must keep our fear in balance, and regain some common sense. <h> New yorker <p> I could n't agree more she should be happy got was able to go home and see her family, those that perished on 9-11 did n't make it home... Go back where your from and blame your own people.... Did it bother you that you were taken off plane well deal with it... it was better to be taken off a plane than to have been blown up and never see your family agian. Your people came and killed our family did you think that everything was going to be okay NO it 's not. What happened to you is nothing compared to what happened to those innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came from. " She 's American. Her own people did not participate in 9/11. Blaming her for 9/11 just because she happens to share ethnicity with the people who flew the planes is racism, pure and simple. And in this case, SHE is the innocent one. <h> avery <p> not so sure about that. Do n't know you.... and based on your own bigoted and racist remarks( " fat ", " fat belly ", " rednecks "), I do n't care to. <p> You are very offensive. <p> And it 's likely most people here do n't ' know you ' and what your real motivations are -- a bored housewife trying to get blog hits( like a crack addict off a crack pipe?).... a homegrown terrorist( we 've had our share of those, too -- does n't matter if you are " American " or from mars)... what? <p> do n't know.... do n't want to know. you were doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like the consequences so you are crying foul. It 's not a new phenomenon -- - many people getting caught not obeying the rules do the same thing -- - trying not to take responsibility for their OWN actions. <p> If you really want to teach your children something -- teach them to be responsible for themselves and not blame their situation on a made-up fantasy such as " racism " -- as your writings clearly show you are the racist. <p> And let it be known, plenty of people of ALL ethnic backgrounds have been shaken down by airport security. We just do n't whine about it. <h> Another New Yorker <h> Dina <p> New Yorker- You are a disgrace to the American people. People like you are the reason so many countries hate us. Before you tell people to go back to where they are from- take some pride in where you are from and LEARN HOW TO PROPERLY SPEAK ENGLISH. If you did n't notice there have been approximately two insulting comments written, but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There is a better way to make your point without demanding that someone -- who is also an American, by the way- leave the country. " Her people " did not kill your family, as " her people " are not terrorists, the hijackers were. <h> Gideon V. <p> @new yorker " Your people "?! " Go back to where you 're from " Really?! What part of " her people " are you referring to? The Arabic or the Jewish part? Never mind, from your comments I gather that you do n't even realize there is a difference. Man, if people would only read and educate themselves a little bit before making comments like yours, the world would be a better place for sure! <h> BayAreaBiker <p> Wow! I am just shocked at the level of your ignorance. Her family came and blew up your family? Which family are you talking about? The White family? or does it include all of Americans? I am sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shebshi your family too. <p> Thanks for enlightening us with your bigoted remarks. But do you know that there were two other folks got " detained " who were actually from Indian descent and along with her, their rights were violated too. Last time I checked, none of the Indians were involved in ANY terrorist attacks against US. Do you have the same thing to say to them also? <h> e <p> " New Yorker " -- she is home, and I wish there were more people like her in this country than those filled with hate and bigotry like yourself. Her experience 10 years ago on that day was the same as everyone else in America -- sadness and disbelief. People of all races can and have done terrible things to others -- to think that we can blindly make judgments about entire groups of people based on the actions of some is insane. <p> I find it incredible how so many people seem to think that they can compare experiences of being pulled aside and searched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jen D <p> Just a reminder, New Yorker, that Shosi is an American citizen -- born and raised here. When you begin invoking " Your people " you cross the line. Her father was Saudi by birth, but lived here in the U.S. for the majority of his life. Her mother is an American. When you tell her to " go back where your( sic) from and blame your own people, " should she head back to Southern California? Seriously? <h> What To Do? <h> Tony <p> Keep believing that Stacie, the Govt do nt give a damn about the people. oh you are going to see in the next couple of years what they have planned for all of us, They have already started a National I.D. card with chips in it, putting cameras all over the country, putting chips in our bodies with all of our information on it, Making it very hard for people to attain passports, Locking the borders on both sides not to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone who does nt think for themselves in fear. And for those of us who can see outside of the box and see what is really going on are called nut jobs, crazy and conspiracy theorist because we see and know what is really going on and choose not to go along with the rest of the Sheeple within the collective society of Idiots that easily fall prey to Manipulation. <h> Joe Jericho <p> Stacie, did you say the same thing during the Bush administration? If you did not, you are a partisan hack. It 's ok for Obama to do it, but not Bush. There are people on the other side of the equation who would say that it was ok for Bush to do this but not Obama. It all makes me sick. IT IS N'T OK FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM TO DO THIS! Wake up.! <h> Jeannie <p> Stacie, I could not disagree with you more. Citizens with this attitude helped, yes I do mean helped, the followers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of mankind. This is the same attitude that allowed the internment of American citizens of Japenese descent during WWII. It is NEVER ok to allow ANY abridgement to our constitutional rights, for ANY prupose. In this case there was an unreasonable search and this poor woman was incarcerated( liberty). I am sure that if I called your local police station and( without giving my name) told them that you had bomb making equipment hidden away and were planning an attack and they then removed you from your workplace in handcuffs, strip searched you, locked you in a cell for 4+ hours without allowing you any contact with the outside world, repeatedly questioned you and then let you go saying " No hard feelings " you would be filing a lawsuit within minutes of your release. This entire episode is merely an illustration of how much we have all allowed our Constitutional rights to be infringed upon in the name of " security ". We should all be outraged that we have allowed this to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veteran who has personally deployed to these war zones you are misinformed if you believe there has been cooperation by these governments, or their people. The overwhelming majority of people in this region are raised and educated to hate Americans and Jews. This is a Fact! I understand your points of view and respect your tenacity in defending them. I do agree that these individuals were racially profiled and their rights were violated. Being half Hispanic I emphasize with them, and realize if I were one of the three in that row I might have been in a cell along with them. This being said I understand the actions that were taken. Although it is unfortunate, it is also naive to think that others with a law enforcement or military background what not have had the same suspicions in that circumstance. I can tell you from experience that they would have. It 's not politically correct and it 's a sobering and incovienent truth but profiling is a necessary and successful tool. This has been the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after. When profiling becomes wrong is when the intent is skewed. They were n't harassed simply because they were of ethnic decent. They fit a particular description on a particular day and happened to randomly commit an act that when compounded with all the factors did create reasonable suspicion. It 's no different than if a blond haired blue male robbed a bank the first 3 Fridays in a month, all similar males would be more scrutinized the 4th Friday. It 's unfortunate but reasonable. If these people would have been working together and had an explosive device, these posts would probably look a lot different as we thankfully honored this civilian for being observant and vigilant. We can have empathy for a person or group of people for an unfair situation but that does n't ultimately make the situation wrong. Let 's not blame the people trying to protect us. There is really only one group that deserves blame, The Terrorists.... <h> alytron <h> Ron <p> The US has several wars going on at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women overseas protecting our freedoms. I say bullshit, I do n't think our freedom was ever threatened by these nations we 're at war with. Not to say that I do n't appreciate our military, I wish them the best, and they 're just doing what they 're told. But protecting our freedom at the moment, I do n't see it. <p> That all said, protecting the freedoms of US citizens also falls upon the shoulders of ordinary US citizens, so when you see some situation no matter how offensive, like when the KKK wants to peacefully assemble, you need to support it. I hate those bastards, but I support their 1st amendment rights. <p> I hope the blogger mounts a legal action and lets us know about it, I 'll certainly help support her. She definitely should 've lawyered up but there is absolutely no reason, based on what I 've read that they had probable cause to strip search her. <p> And frankly, anyone that will trade their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a continuous fight, but it is mostly fought at home. <h> Zoe <p> Do you really think that fear Americans have, is because of the terrorist destruction of the day 9/11? No The fear Americans have is rooted in the governments manipulation of the media. remember the daily color codes codes we had to deal with every day? These so called " Terror Alerts ", caused Americans to live in fear up to the illegal unjustified, oil driven invasion of Iraq. The sudden growth and expansion of an actual International American Empire, came to fruition from this galvanizing of the fear of the citizens of our USA. This is a sad fact and very true. The largest untapped oil fields in the world lie in Iraq and Iran. Does anyone really think the USA can survive without taking these lands, in the event of some shortage? NO. The answer is NO. So Bush and now Obama are protecting our oil interests abroad. Also noteworthy is the fact that Afghanistan has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that are absolutely necessary for the manufacture of technology. Think we can do without those in a shortage? No absolutely NOT. This is n't about justice or what is right. This is about hedging bets during a time of depleting resources and rising demand from the worlds increasing populations AND the need to protect a lifestyle that is dependent on these substances to survive. If oil and rare earth minerals and metals where to stop, we would be suddenly relegated to a lifestyle like that of colonial America, without the established skill sets. With an increased population, and a short supply of all energy producing material( including wood), complicated by the inability to transport, a very quick spiral into hunger and death would occur. This is the concern behind the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, This invasion is also to surround Iran and keep it in check, ready to pounce if need be : eg ; nukes, need oil. The profiling and nabbing of people here in the states is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe this is right. But I do know that this is what is happening. I believe their are other ways to get along, peaceful ways that build trust. This is all very sad, yet with our youth there is hope and we must teach them that peace is the only answer. We must teach billions of people to help each other. How? I do not know. Watch the documentary W. on hulu. It shows what happened, all of the planning and hubris, all of the capitulation. None of these people were heroes. As a matter of fact they were killing hundreds of thousands and walking around like a bunch of morons planning it all. The movie W. is a perfect example of why war should only be used for actual self defense against invasion, or an attack by an actual nation using real weapons. You ca n't have a war against an idea, because the fighting will last until the idea is gone, which in this case since war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke, it is real. The United States Of America, my only home, will have troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and possibly other places, forever? Until a new source of energy is established? what? What is this? I am also afraid to say anything here for fear of big brother. But I will be an American and say my piece, Freedom of Speech protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States Of America, is my right and I will defend it by using my right. <h> The Mommy Lane <p> Reading this post broke my heart. Words can not express how sorry I am that this happened. My heart goes out to you and I hope that you will be able to move on from this without too many scars. The effects of racism are powerful and they can change who you are as a person. <h> Ranti <p> I am 30 yrs old, I am a family physician and I am also African.Let us call a spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is racial profiling, period. <p> As a frequent visitor to the US, I have over time and out of necessity, become somewhat immune to the frustrating and sometimes inane questioning &; searching that I 've had to endure at point of entry into this great country, simply because of my skin colour and the colour of my passport. <p> However, on my most recent visit here, the treatment was so appalling, I was almost left in tears. I had flown in from Heathrow in London, and as I was passing through immigration to get onto a connecting flight to DC from Miami, I was stopped and questioned 3 times for no apparent reason at all, but as the only non-white person on that plane, it was n't rocket-science to figure out why. <p> After the third dude had finished questioning me, I was aksed to follow him and as we were walking down the corridor towards a room, I politely asked him what was going on and if whatever was going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be boarding in about 40 mins.Without so much as a glance at me, he barked &; said " Sir, I do n't care. You could be there for 20mins or you could be there for 4 hours, it is what it is ". <p> So I was led into this room and as I walked in, I observed that there were about 60 other people in that room -- and what was so immediately obvious was that apart from myself there were 4 other black people in there with the rest being hispanic, so clearly, nothing " random " about this " stop &; search " then. I was kept in there for about 2 and a half hoursand eventually when I was called to the desk, the questions asked were the SAME ones the previous 3 guys had asked me -- " Why are you here? '. " What do you do? ", " How long are you here for? ", " You were in this country 3 times last year, how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( Well, because I can afford it, duh!!), that plus the fact that I 've got family here- I was at my brother 's graduation from Harvard, I was best man at my friend 's wedding in Texas and I also came later on in the year for a medical conference in New York. There you go all explained, the barking at me was totally unnecessary as was the suspicious tone &; manner in which the questions were yelled at me. By this time of course, I 'd not only missed my scheduled connecting flight, but also 2 other connecting flights I could potentially had got on, my checked-in luggage had already gone ahead to my destination airport, and I did n't get into my final destination until 3:30 a.m the next morning -- at another airport miles away from where my luggage had gone( my previous scheduled arrival barring this incident was to have been 6pm). It was an altogether very unpleasant experience and made me reflect on whether I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each trip from Europe with ticket fare, hotel stay, spending money etc, usually costs me at least $2,000. That 's $2,000 to the US economy each time I come here, but if i 'm going to be made to feel as if I must be up to no good simply because of my skin colour, then is it really worth it? Might it not be better to take my tourist dollars to say Bahamas for example, at least there I know I wo n't be humiliated for being " different ". No one is saying Homeland Security should n't do their job, and post 9/11, I understand the paranoia that 's quite prevalent in the society these days. But there must be a way in which the job can be done more efficiently &; competently and certainly more courteously, with respect and dignity to the passenger/traveller. Not all visitors to the US bear malicious intent towards this great nation, and certainly not all " non-white, non-American " nationals of other great countries are terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant experience that you had to go through Hoshana, I am very happy and applaud you for sharing your experience and thus helping to initiate and generate debate and discussion on this topical issue. <p> The bitter truth of the matter is that this sort of thing happens ALL to the time to those of us who are " different " on account of descent or accent. Our stories never get told because we are " foreign " and so therefore in some way, in does n't matter the way we are treated, because we do n't matter, we do n't have a voice. <h> Anne <p> They have not accomplished that task. Accomplishing this task would not generate over 300 supporters of this post and 1,726 responses. The world is evolving into one of dialogue and communication. How many individual people around the world respond to a community 's aid in the face of devastation? This past Sunday I decided to read up on 9/11 -- not the political rhetoric, but what people did and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was amazed. <h> Alicia Chandler <p> I hate it, but I have to agree with your point of the terrorists winning by turning Americans and people in general against each other, based on race and/or ethnicity. <p> Thank you so much for sharing your horror with us, to make us all aware of what is happening to innocent people all the time. Unfortunately, we sometimes need a reminder, and I hate that it was at your expense, and the expense of the other two gentlemen who went through it with you. I pray that you will be able to ' be the bigger person ', and expect that you are, by not hating all of us for the bigots and jerks that ARE out there. Hugs and prayers, <h> Abhi <p> Personally, as a non-american, I can completely understand a country that was attacked by a bunch of foreigners, conducting racial-profiling... of foreigners. But when some geniuses decide that the response to terrorists from another country blowing up stuff, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals, it starts seeming surreal. How hard would it be to just maybe casually check the " suspects " for weapons and isolate them while you checked if they actually were citizens or not? If they are citizen how does anything else matter? How many americans participated in 911 exactly? <p> I could totally understand if I as a foreigner was treated as a suspect. Hey, I have all the choice in the world to not to travel to USA. I mean the country was attacked by foreigners, so I may not like to be treated like this, but I can at least understand. <p> But why should an American citizen be understanding about this? Why should they cooperate? <p> And what is even more surreal is that majority of Americans will actually accept this kind of logic and take it lying down. Why is no one actually asking their representatives, why the government is treating its own citizens as potential terrorists? Why is no one asking Obama this question on Live TV? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a non-American citizen. I also believe that if this happened to an American flying to another country, there would be a lot of yelling and self-righteousness about how dare they detain me, etc. But, for an American, in America, its just taken as if its for the ' Good of the General Population '. Those bleak futures spoken about in 1984 and Brave New World are coming true and America is the leader. <h> Cassandra <p> " I also believe that if this happened to an American flying to another country, there would be a lot of yelling and self-righteousness about how dare they detain me, etc. " <p> Exactly. Imagine three American white dudes getting pulled off a plane in Jordan, or China, and being arrested and interrogated for six hours. The American press would go absolutely apeshit. <p> But the scariest thing about this is the( nice) FBI agent mentioning that there had been 50 similar incidents that day. This is not a unique story that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry ". This is something that happened to one intelligent, eloquent woman with a blog who wanted to share her story, and about a hundred other people who we have n't heard from, who probably want to forget the entire thing. It 's not an freak accident -- this is how Homeland Security works, and it is beyond ridiculous. According to the AP article, the government sent two fighter jets to " escort " the plane into Detroit. Because there were too many brown people in one place, and one of them had the drizzling shits during the flight. Terrifying, really. <p> I think as an immigrant who is now an American citizen( and well aware of American history and culture), I concur with Abhi 's words. American citizens should not take this lying down or without clothes. The person should sue the government and take it to the Supreme Court and get them to rule on this issue, and who knows, a court may well find these kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is doing this since they do n't have the resources to deal with the legal system( which has become a travesty). So unless you can fight your own case or unless you 're rich enough to hire a good lawyer, you 're hosed. <h> JackRabbit <p> Our " representatives " are not( and have not for some time) representing us. They speak for their bank accounts and special interest groups. They do n't care about what happens to the average American so long as they get theirs. <h> Finisterre <p> Wait, what? So it 's not OK for Shoshana to be arrested and humiliated, likely because of her ethnicity, because she 's an American citizen, but it would be absolutely fine for a *non-American* person to be arrested and humiliated because of their ethnicity? <p> This is *exactly* the same thinking that caused this disgusting incident to happen to Shoshana. Racial profiling is wrong because it targets innocent people for very nasty harassment on unacceptably vague and ineffective grounds. What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not. It is not an effective way of preventing terrorism and it is certainly not the action of a liberal, rational state. <h> Chris <h> In Respect <p> Abhi, thank you for your comment. As an American, I appreciate your appreciation of why racial profiling is a logical course of action to take. To your question, a couple of the latest attempted attacks were by American citizens with ties to terror groups and if I recall, there was some indication that attempts on the anniversary might be by " home grown terrorists ". <h> Lisa <p> Unfortunately, we have terrorists here in our own country that are citizens and who choose to follow some anti-American train of thought. Whether American citizens or not, any form of terrorist is not something anybody in any country should have to deal with. With that being said, it is horrible that this woman underwent this treatment. It 's like seeing somebody on the street and assuming they are a gang member because of the way they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest form of biggotry has come at the expense of those of middle-eastern heritage. Even President Obama has had to endure such prejudice even after he has won an election and is trying to run a country. I hope this helps us all to become more accepting of others... even if they look like they are middle-eastern. Just like every other generalization, just because their skin is darker or they look a certain way, does n't mean that are going to do harm to anyone or anything. <h> Chris <p> did you know that at least one of the terrorists who help hijack one of the airlines was an american citizen and had been living in america legally practically his whole life? he had 2 kids and a wife and lived in florida. but yet you ask why us americans treat our own citizens like this its because of people like that terrorist. just because your a citizen does nt mean your here because you love the country. and that goes for any race for those people who like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So, it is your opinion that all American citizens should be strip searched and cavity probed either before, during, or after flying, yes? I mean, if you are making the argument that one of the 9/11 terrorists was an American citizen, then all American citizens need to be searched and interrogated the way Ms. Shebshi was, according to that logic. <p> Unless you are making the argument that only SOME American citizens should be searched and interrogated, and certainly you are n't making that argument, are you? <h> Ron <p> Well.. looking nervous is fairly normal when there is a threat of a finger going up your butt. And what paperwork?, flying domestically in the US no ID is required, you will definitely be held up without it, but you can freely travel from Maine to California by bus with no formal ID, flying is no different. <h> Allison <p> My comments were based on " Chris " ' s original posts, the first part of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one of the terrorists who help hijack one of the airlines was an american citizen and had been living in america legally practically his whole life? he had 2 kids and a wife and lived in florida. but yet you ask why us americans treat our own citizens like this its because of people like that terrorist. " <p> My assumption, based on that post, is that " Chris " was saying that because one of the 9/11 terrorists was an American citizen, it was okay to target American citizens for Constitutional rights violations. If " Chris " was saying something else, it was not clear what that was. <p> Ms. Shebshi 's paperwork was not at issue, nor was her demeanor at issue. She was reported for suspicious activity for sitting in the same row as men of Indian descent. <h> Justin <p> Allison, millions of American citizens who have the appearance of possible middle eastern decent, myself included have been aboard air planes since 9/11. These people are not routinely strip searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique circumstances. I belief your views are coming from a noble place, but it does n't seem as if you are able to step back and view this particular incident objectively. Although everybody should be empathetic for these individuals involved, I think most rational people who are able to put aside political correctness and be honest with themselves would admit that the particular circumstances of this incident would create reasonable suspicion. <h> Allison <p> The particular circumstances of this incident create reasonable suspicion how? Simply because Ms. Shebshi was sitting in the same row as two other dark-skinned individuals? What did Ms. Shebshi do that fit the description of suspicious activity? <p> Just because every single dark-skinned flier is n't strip searched and interrogated does n't mean that we should n't be outraged when racial profiling is done for some of them. <h> Joe Jericho <p> I do n't get this comment either. I am looking at this objectively and asking questions, which is what Allison is doing. Obviously, Allison is concerned not only with this incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. I am also concerned about this. Clearly, there are not enough facts known for you to conclude that there was reasonable suspicion in this case. The blog entry does n't demonstrate the facts, but neither does the AP story. I want to know more. In the meantime, it sounds like some other passenger(s) reported " suspicious activity ". What does that mean? Should the government have to articulate to the aggrieved what that suspicion was or what it constitutes? This is a dangerous situation that is used in Cuba all the time to go in and ransack people 's homes and lives. Seemingly, we are but a step away from that. I have a problem with that. <h> Tony S <p> I 'm one of those US citizens who appears to be of middle eastern descent, though I 'm of Italian and Mexican heritage. Prior to 9-11 I was frequently stopped by airport security for additional checks, including having my laptop case swiped with a card to check for chemical residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just plain annoying. My being stopped meant my co-workers had to wait for me, or worse, they would be checked as well. <p> Following 9-11, my first few trips through airport security were much different. My first flight was just after planes were allowed to fly again, and there were some in the media warning of racial profiling. During that first trip, not only was n't I checked, when I passed the security personnel that checked bags for chemical substance, the officers actually turned away from me. While it was a nice change, I did n't think it was going to last. It did n't. <p> Not long after, I was almost always taken aside for extra screening at the main checkpoint, and occasionally had the " X " on my ticket that identified me as someone who had to be checked at the gate as well. It would sometimes take me a half hour to get through security from start to finish, not counting the time I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be just a progression in making the flying public feel more secure, I soon came to resent all the extra attention. So did my co-workers. <p> While my experiences were n't as extreme as Mrs. Shebshi 's, it was apparent to me that things were going too far. People should n't have to go through this, not in the USA. It 's not what we stand for, and none of us should accept it as the price to pay because some people wish to live in fear. <p> At no time does law enforcement have a right to invade our physical self without due cause. And last I heard, an unsubstantiated allegation is considered hearsay, not due cause. <p> if you 're willing to give up your Constitutional rights, including the right to privacy and the assumption of innocent until proven guilty, be my guest, but do n't demand the same from me. <h> Charls Martel <p> Correct, there is no way to tell if someone is a terrorist by Citicenship. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have evidence of the contrary( that is, no us citien engages or will engage in a form of terrorism). <p> in the end the moral of the story should be about how everyone should get along, because it is not about the rules we put into place doing what they were designed to do. <h> Joe Jericho <p> With all due respect, that is because you just are n't aware period. Again, I 'd like to know where an anonymous report leads to a strip search without more reasonable suspicion. Obviously, they searched her to see if she had a device or explosive on her person, right? I mean, what other technical explanation for the search? She was screened by TSA. They can check her hands and garmets for explosive residue. They can do an enhanced pat-down, but no, they wanted to do the strip search. Why? You do n't know why, but the government does and I want to hear the explanation. Maybe TSA Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). lol <h> Lance <p> 4th Amendment -- unreasonable search and seizure, based upon the report of " suspicious activity "( which was merely sitting in her seat) by a citizen with no applicable training to determine probable cause. <p> 6th Amendment -- the right to face your accuser. <p> A lesson in Constitutional law would serve you well. <h> Matt <p> We are a nation governed by the Rule of Law. That is the essence of a Republic. There are three sources of law in this country -- the United States Constitution, Congress, and Common Law as established through the precedents set by our court system. The last time I checked, the crashing of planes into buildings by foreign terrorists does NOT constitute one of those sources of law. It therefore does not grant legitimacy to measures which contradict our fundamental laws. <p> Presumption of innocence is a firmly established matter of Common Law in this country. Coffin v. United States firmly established that. It does not need a word-for-word presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your notion that " all individuals should be treated with equal suspicion. unless you have evidence of the contrary( that is, no us citien engages or will engage in a form of terrorism), " is as unpatriotic and illegal as it is paranoid. <h> Susan <p> Have you read the Constitution? Of course her rights were violated. Also I am not aware that any of the alleged highjackers were American. One lived in FL and worked for the NSA- Mohammed Atta- an Egyptian. But he was employed by our own gov.- the NSA. His father also claims to have gotten a call from him the day after 911. 7 of the alleged highjackers turned up alive and living abroad. One had died 2 years before. HOW CAN ANY GOV. HAVE MUGSHOTS of 19 men and have " solved the crime " within 2 days of the event before doing an investigation- especially when these 19 names were not on the official passenger lists- and where would they have gotten mugshots? <h> Paul K <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumnavigating, if you look of Arabsub Asian descent and are a US cititzen you should accept to be treated differently. So much for equal rights and discrimination, but do nt worry ' " its for you 're own protection " <h> Grammar Clown <h> MrLee <p> OH NO SHE MADE A SPELLING ERROR!! Lets discredit everything they say because they used your instead of you 're!! Give me a break and grow the F up and get over it!!! Anyways, I am very sorry for what happened to you Shoshana!! Like someone typed above " People have become so paranoid, scared of every shadow, every whisper that is n't government sanctioned. I am ashamed of people who react blindly. " <h> Chetan <h> Joe Jericho <p> That 's a good point. Right now, I am not familiar with it. I have just heard and seen a lot of white people and white kids getting groped at the airport, but I digress, I suppose it could be worse. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling is that the government no longer works for us. It is us against them. They treat us as their subjects, and that is not the America I grew up in. <h> Kathy <p> our own citizens do plot against us!! There are Americans involved in terrorist activities. That is part of the problem!! I feel bad about this particular incident but I also understand where whoever reported this is coming from. I wish they would have watched more closely because if what you say is true( never left your seat, did n't talk to anyone etc.) than hopefully it would never had happened!! But I am very nervous to fly. And I do watch others very carefully when I 'm flying. I do agree a casual " check " would have been better. Americans come in all races and all nationalities and so I really do watch everyone!! <h> Allison <h> Justin <p> Allison please provide links to distinctly identifiable white Americans that hijacked air planes and flew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to similar looking distinctly identifiable white Americans being handcuffed and removed from a plane, strip and cavity searched, and interrogated because they randomly found themselves in a situation that provoked reasonable suspicion... It 's not as simple as your trying to make it!!! <h> K <p> In 1974, a disgruntled white man walked into BWI, shot and killed an airport security guard and then proceeded to hijack an airliner for the sole purpose of flying it into the white house and killing the President. Does that sound at least similar to 9/11? Things like that event actually have happened quite a few times but rarely go reported for security reasons. We do n't want people to know just how often government leaders are targeted. <p> The situation described by Mrs. Hebshi was racially motivated and no reasonable probable cause was given to justify the actions taken. <h> JK <h> Allison <p> Just because Ms. Shebshi happens to be in the same ethnic group as the 9/11 terrorist does not make her a terrorist, nor does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by definition. <h> Joe Jericho <p> I think Justin makes a good point, but this is why we need something more of an Israeli-based screening model, not the monster we have created due to political concerns. At the same time, you are correct about the reasonable suspicion angle. As a regular joe looking out for my family and our freedoms, I do believe that the enhanced screening needs to be appropriately targeted, but in this case, we are talking about prior-screening, not after that fact harassment like we see here. This story implicates do many problems with what is going on with air transportation in America and even other societal issues. <h> David <p> Timothy McVeigh was a typical looking white American. He personally participated in the planning and execution of a terrorist attack in the US that killed 167 people. He did n't use a plane, he used a Ryder rental truck. <p> By your logic, can you provide links to similar looking white Americans being handcuffed and detained, strip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renting a moving truck? <h> Jess <p> I mean, really, literally-Joe-Biden, it is. I 'm not just some airheaded pwog that likes to use that word all the time. Attempting to justify mistreatment of human beings by referring to the actions of other people with a similar ethnicity is like straight out of the KKK, yo. <p> Timmy McVeigh was white, and every day thousands of people that look just like him hang out at federal buildings without getting strip-searched. Furthermore, they would n't get strip-searched even if some cowardly mouth-breathing kook called in a warning of " suspicious behavior ". Double standard, amirite? <h> Tony <p> You have my utmost respect and admiration for your very sensible and logical comment. It 's more about controlling and stripping the citizenry of our rights than it is about security. Why could n't they have put the " suspects " through one of those virtual clothes-stripping scanners when they were taken into custody, and/or had them sniffed by a bomb-detecting dog, or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were subjected. Ok, it 's plausible that a plot could have existed, and perhaps that plot could include blowing the whole plane up when it reaches the terminal, but that 's the risk everyone takes when we travel -- some idiot is gon na do something stupid. I 'm not going to blame the Captain, who ultimately decided that the information relayed to him in-flight by his crew was enough reason to report it to authorities on the ground, who made the call based on a report passed-off 3rd-hand from 30,000 feet. For crying out loud, the flight was traveling from a U.S. major city, not some foreign country that could care less about our security concerns. They could have given the people something like a sobriety test on the spot, like, " who 's your Senator or Congressman? " or " describe the house that you grew up in. " If they start singing alla akbar, or some other crazy crap, then they get strip searched. But if they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them go, or at least tell them that if they do n't strip or somehow show that they 're legit, then they 'll be subjected to surveillance, and/or put on the no-fly list, for say, 6 months. I mean, whatever happened to the protection against " unreasonable searches and seizures? " If you 're born here, and/or you have melted into the pot by learning the language and you dress and act like an American, like this Mom apparently does, give ' em a break! Take down their license, and follow up if they feel as though they 're a threat. If they are, then more terrorists could be caught w/out even having to do the Chinese water-torture thing. <p> That is so true @ Abhi and I absolutely support it. I mean as a non-american citizen and a colored person i get stopped at every single air travel and i am always one of those randomly chosen persosn who is put through full body search or asked to randomly open her cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been cleared. however i have always justified that as thinking a country which has been attacked has some right to check international incoming people more stringently than citizens. but its un-acceptable when its meted out to american citizens because of color. as someone very well said before in one of the posts-its okay to harasss colored " American citizens " because caucasian citizens can feel safer! wow! <h> Joe Jericho <p> This is n't totally right. My white brother gets harassed flying to Asia all the time, both here in the US and over there. He just fits some kind of profile, probably involving drugs. But, I commend you for recognizing, without knowing our laws, that you traditionally you do not have the same rights when you are trying to enter the country from abroad as opposed to already being here. Unfortunately, our government is not recognizing this right all that much at the airports and even at the bus and train stations on occasion when they set up mobile TSA checkpoints. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to just maybe casually check the " suspects " for weapons and isolate them while you checked if they actually were citizens or not? " <p> Believe it or not, Abhi, this is not a question of citizenship. All non-citizens who are in the United States have the same rights afforded by the constitution as do citizens. The only right they do n't have is the right to vote. <h> Rightasrain <h> Marnie <p> Um, no -- the people in charge of our own financial systems bankrupted us. Blaming it on the 9/11/01 attacks is simply an extreme form of laziness and denial, not to mention an aversion to taking responsibility for changing the situation. We are the only ones responsible for our reactions to their actions. We could have responded differently. There was certainly no need to declare war on Iraq in response to an attack by a rebel group in Afghanistan. Obviously, many Americans need to wipe the sleep from their eyes and start looking at the cold hard facts. But, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get off their lazy asses, turn off the reality t.v., put away the Doritos and actually do something... I mean, who is actually going to admit responsibility for something they 'd have to do something about if they were to acknowledge the truth? This corrupt government is doing an amazing job of keeping us sick and unmotivated to move at all. This is not the fault of the terrorists -- it 's not even the fault of our government! It is our own fault. So, either stop bothering to comment on blogs about it, or get off your asses and do something. <h> M <p> Marnie, how you feel about the war is exactly how I feel about it -- it was unnecessary.( Read what I wrote again -- I said " response to 9/11? -- I did n't say 9/11 itself). But it was n't the banking system that caused us trillions of dollars deficit... it was the war. By September 2008 when the banks collapsed, we already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way, this is what the terrorists ultimately want : the collapse of America. That 's why they chose the twin towers in Manhattan -- it 's a symbol of our dreams and also our might, it 's right next to Wall Street. Did they expect our economy to collapse? No. They did n't even think the towers would collapse( going by a recent documentary I saw about Bin Laden). But we responded in such a way as to bankrupt ourselves. <h> Martijn <p> Unfortunately, it will be a long long way( if ever) to return to anything that resembles normal. A major problem is that instilling fear works very well on most( and it seems especially the American) people. Sad but true. People do n't rationalize for themselves anymore, they let others tell them " truths " and use fear as a way to feed these truths. Look at advertisement for health products for example, most of it is based on fear. <h> Laura <p> The last ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sociology of Nazism and/or Communism. The question of how a civilized and educated people( Germany in the beginning of the 20th century) would become accomplices to the Nazi government that passed the Nuremberg laws and how a people would turn their backs on their neighbors and friends, locking the other way when the authorities arrested and detained with no other reason but race is being answer here, in America, for the last ten years. Cowered by fear, not only of terrorists but of the Homeland security, FBI and the slew of other agencies that grew out of 9/11, each of us is silent and compliant, when not others rights are infringed but ours as well. Now we know that the communists might not have been smart economists or administrators but they were brilliant sociologists and psychologists. They knew that once the spirit of a people is broken through terror controlling the individuals is easy. You just need to reinforce the memory once in a while, just to remind the folks who is in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, take away their rights -- not all at once, just few at a time -- and, when one day, they will realize what happens to them it would be too late -- the muzzle in place, the chains permanently attached and a fake smile required -- they are now protected. <p> I understand the thoughts of trying to equate Nazism and Communism to overeacting security issues such as this but they are not even close to being on the same moral plane and I am so tired of people comparing one kind of issue to another without really critically looking at the nature of the items being compared. Your reaction is the fear itself, not what is going on. I have had other times when authorities have required my personal information due to suspicions but you do n't argue, you deal with it and if there is a violation of your rights you lawyer up. That 's life. <h> Ian <p> Er. In what way IS this different than the early years of Nazism and Communism? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the German people just going along with it is what allowed it to progress into its later, worse forms. <p> You stop things like that at THIS point, not at THAT point. Your argument is what? Are we supposed to wait until we get to Stalin before we take any action, or are we supposed to try to point out how wrong it is NOW, BEFORE we get to Stalin? <h> paul <p> early nazism did n't look anything like what the writers did. early nazism involved serious amounts pressure and injustice at an ENTIRE group. This story illustrates what happened to a few of the millions of indians/middle easterners in this country. there is no systematic effort by the government to prevent these folks from owning property, getting a job, or anything else the nazis forced on the jews during their early reign in germany. <p> also, although i 'm deeply disturbed by how this situation was handled by the government( in an unthinking, mindless, by the book way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane to be blown up. i agree that these folks should have been taken outside the plane for a moment, questioned by a seasoned professional or maybe an israeli agent( the israeli airport authorities are crackerjack at this) in the back of a bus or something, and then cleared to go. there are tell tale signs of terror and a seasoned agent would be able to pick up on these things immediately. I really think this is the result of 1) it being 9/11 2) rednecks on the plane who would rather be safe than sorry 3) officers who are not able to think or making decisions but have to follow protocol by the book. In any case, this never should have happened. <p> You need to study how nazism and stalinism worked. It is the exact same game plan, exact same process, for the same reasons, for the same goals. Read Rise and Fall by Shirer, and read why the communists built the berlin wall, for exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security, economic concerns, terrorism... It needs to stop now. <h> Tom Lange <p> I do n't think you are looking at the big picture in your reply... Nazi Germany started by believing that a certain group of people were to blame... They became the focal point, and the scapegoat... And from there, it was n't long before Hitler was leading the lemmings on a leash-to genocide. <p> Take a step back, and look again... The similarities are there... If you do n't see them, I suggest that you might believe that " apples and oranges " is a valid expression of disparate things...( it is n't.) <h> Tony <p> Tom I agree with you and Ian, I have studied WWII and I thoroughly. Heres what the Sheeple you are arguing with can not see and what happened ten years ago is exactly what happened in Nazi Germany. <p> As a reasoned to give him control over Germany He burned down the Parliament building and blamed it on foreign terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples right away and made them the enemy as well as have their blessing to go to war to get the terrorist. <p> And this was exactly what happened on 9/11 our own Govt did this blamed it on foreign terrorist of middle eastern decent to get us into war while at the same time created laws that made us the enemy. <p> All of Bushes speeches were recycled Hitler speeches with Hitlers named changed to Bush, and so his daddy and the Bin Ladens made billions and Billions of Dollars along with the new tricky Dick( Chaney) The Bank HSBC and loads of others. <h> Joe Jericho <p> I agree with your other posts, but not this one. First of all, Hitler blamed the torching of the Reichstag on the Communists, as in domestic communists. Minor point, I know. I also agree with you that Bush has played a big hand in this, but Obama has clearly doubled-down on it. This alarms me that both parties act in such a tyrannical and dictatorial fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestapo " and nazi-like, and they are, but I think if we are moving towards one model at all, it is more of a socialist/communist model rather than a fascist model. Of course, by now, the argument is almost semantical. Who cares? We the people get screwed. We need Obama to get tossed out of the white house. At the same time, we do n't need one party controlling all of government. I suffer no delusions that a Republican president is going to stop all of this nonsense going on at the airports. Hell, the media wo n't even ask the candidates their stance on this. And we all know that Rick Perry played a major role in killing the Texas anti-TSA state bill. <h> Lance <p> " All of Bushes speeches were recycled Hitler speeches with Hitlers named changed to Bush, and so his daddy and the Bin Ladens made billions and Billions of Dollars along with the new tricky Dick( Chaney) The Bank HSBC and loads of others. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your post as tired rhetorical tripe.( And by the way -- I 'm with the author on this, not those who flail wildly trying to defend undefendable policy) <p> what about the right to remain silent? you come on the airplane, seize me off of it, cuff me, toss me in a cell, and generally behave like a storm trooper. My response is to tell you to f off -- but thats just me. I have ZERO reason to speak with you -- just get me a lawyer and wait for the feces storm to begin. I 'd still be in jail there in Detroit but I will probably never have to work again... because the tax payers will be paying me a huge settlement for the violation of my rights. These folks forget -- WE possess the rights -- we granted a few to the central government. Its too bad that the Civil War ended the way it did -- because it cemented this all knowing all powerful central government that thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe -- that 's quite a leap from 2011 terror issues to the outcome of the Civil War. " It 's too bad that the Civil War ended the way it did... " Seriously? If the other side had prevailed, we would still have slavery as a legal institution in this country. Slavery is the ultimate form of terror, is it not? <h> Mister Aloha <h> BayAreaBiker <p> Yeah! the idea is good up to a point but the problem with that whole plan is what if after arresting, the " authorities " ship you off to Gitmo or try the case in a Military Court. Remember, the " authorities " have access to the media to let the fellow citizens " know " about the " enemy combatant " before you can even get your day in a court of law and say " Not Guilty ". <h> thankful <p> Tt seems to me that all you people are forgetting or overlooking one fact the reason that the plane was stopped was because the two men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the color of their skin. yes she happened to be sitting with them and she unfortunately was gathered into this whole scenario. I would rather be strip-searched and embarrassed and be alive than not and be dead. So maybe we should be thankful that the pilots and the airline attendants are being more aware of the activities of passengers. It seems to me that you people are the one that is making it about race than about facts. I do n't the pilots looked at them and determine whether they were or were not American citizens. I am sure we are all well aware of the fact that there have been American citizens that have committed travesties. So as far as I 'm concerned thank you Frontier pilots and attendant keep up the good job and continue to keep us safe <h> Justin <p> Allison, " Thankful " pointed out logical and objective reasoning that highlighted the unique facts of this individual scenario, but for some reason you are unable or unwilling to step back and view this objectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline and law enforcement the report was neither unspecified or random, to say that you would have to provide evidence that at least on passenger on the plane had a contradictory observation of the men that got up together and spent a long time in the restroom. That information has not even been challenged, hence your arguement of the search being illegal or unreasonable is subjective. I imagine the families of passengers from United Flight 93 might see it differently. <h> Joe Jericho <p> Looks to me like you are frustrated that Allison wo n't see it your way. Sorry, bro, but that 's life. Allison is not acting unreasonable here, and there are loads and loads of unreasonableness on the internet. Allison is looking at this from a more macro point of view in terms how this could impact any and all of us. I understand the viewpoint. If she is n't a lawyer, she might want to consider law school. <h> Allison <h> avery <p> uh... that 's where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming to be American... but you SURE do n't seem to have a clue about American Law and Democracy. <p> I 'm growing more suspicious of you by the minute. <p> We elect our leaders and they make laws that we, as citizens follow. <p> it 's really not all that complicated. <p> No one is " sacrificing their Constitutional rights " -- in fact -- just the opposite. They are following the right to VOTE and have elected leaders make decisions in the best interest of its citizens, which is exactly what Homeland Security was born out of. It 's been around for many years now -- so when have you been exercising your " constitutional right " before then to have it revoked, if that 's what you believe? <p> No one said it was a " random report " -- and no one said it came from a " civilian " -- once again -- you are showing your own bias. <p> The pilots do NOT make decisions to have flights scrambled based on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a civics lesson.... and get up to speed on how Homeland Security really works. <h> Allison <p> Apparently, the decisions of those leaders involved stripping American citizens of their Constitutional rights( or at least redefining those rights in detrimental ways). I do not and did not support those decisions. <p> Pilots, as far as I am aware, do n't make decisions about scrambling F-16s. That would be the decision of Homeland Security, yes? So Homeland Security made the decision to scramble fighter jets, handcuff and detain and strip search and interrogate three innocent people, on the unsubstantiated report of unspecified suspicious activity. <p> That 's not acceptable to me, and it appears based on this comments discussion that it 's not acceptable to a large number of Americans as well. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> " uh... that 's where you are WRONG. We live in a democracy. You keep claiming to be American... but you SURE do n't seem to have a clue about American Law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In a democracy every policy would have to be put to a general election. I do not normally correct another person 's misidentification of our federal government, but since you decided to insult someone 's understanding of that exact topic I could not help myself. You do not have to exercise a right in order to have it taken away. Are you saying that if I exercise my right to remain silent I forever give up my right to free speech? You are correct that the DHS made the decision to sent the two F16s, although from recent articles no authority is taking credit for the strip-search. The FBI has denied any association with it. The airline has denied ever identifying the lady who wrote the blog post. The DHS was created by the legislative branch, but their creation does not mean they are automatically constitutional. The Judicial branch has the power to reject any law that it deems unconstitutional. Unfortunately they can not exercise this power until the law is challenged. This is why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal avenues available to her. I really want to see whether the judicial branch will deem the detention, strip-searching, and interrogation of someone based on the person assigned to sit in the seat next to them spending a bit of time in the bathroom a constitutionally legal procedure. <h> ruth <p> Jonathane -- I hope she does, too, but I wonder if DHS and the airline are already working on sweeping it under the rug and paying the three off so that this test does n't occur, and they continue to operate in the same fashion. With denials from the airline and FBI, it looks as though the documentation trail is already being hidden... or maybe this is just another way that the Patriot Act makes it possible to treat someone as a criminal or combatant, then deny it because there is " no proof " of its occurrence. <h> Anne <p> It was n't because they took a long time in the bathroom, it 's because they went to the bathroom in succession. As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the other one got up and went to the bathroom. Nothing else was offered as suspicious activity besides that and the fact that they were all the same race and were sitting next to each other. Right. That 's totally logical. Two people both having to pee around the same time? That NEVER happens! AND they 're all indian!? Better sound the alarms! <p> Also, if it had been a flight attendant who thought they were taking too long in the bathroom all they would have had to do was check the bathroom after they were out. Have you been in an airplane bathroom? Not many places to stick a bomb. Also? Since when was taking a long time in the bathroom suspicious anyway? Maybe he was taking a shit. Maybe he was jerking off. Maybe he gets sick on flights and was throwing up because he did n't want to sit next to a total stranger and throw up in a bag two inches away from them. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an acceptable thing to have come to your mind. <p> Come back to us when you 've spent six or seven hours in a police cell, without information, or having any clue about whats going on. <p> I find it somewhat gobsmacking that so many people would support such a gross violation of basic human rights based on someone elses paranoia not even based on the observations of trained law professionals. <p> So they spent excess time in the bathroom. I have a stomach bug ATOW, I spent half an hour in the bathroom on a flight this morning, and I 'm willing to put money on the fact no one would have blinked an eyelid because I 'm white <h> Joe <p> Amazing, all of this happened because they spent too much time or made multiple trips to the rest rest room? People have health issues. Sometimes it is nervousness that results in multiple trips to the rest room. Irritable bowel syndrom, Colitis, nausia etc. There is absolutely no reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep in mind, these people were searched even before getting into the airport sterile area. Where was the risk? What threat did these people present that required the treatment that they received? <p> The bottom line here is that the LEO 's were out of line and completely unjustified in what they did. <h> Ram <p> why is it that people are willing to sacrifice their constitutional rights in this case, but when it comes to giving up the right to bear arms, its ' " over my cold dead hands "? <p> Does every white person who buys fertilizer now come under suspicion because of Timothy McVeigh? Let 's be clear, Timothy McVeigh and all the crazies who 've gone postal and fired automatic weapons in schools, malls, offices, etc have done much more damage to America without nearly the negative response. <h> Kremmen <p> " thankful ", you are simply an idiot. You are praising the pilots and FA for stupidity in causing someone 's suffering for no reason with no justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air already. The crew did nothing to restrain the passengers, so, if they 'd had a weapon, they had every opportunity to use it. The Frontier staff involved should be arrested for making a false report and should pay compensation to every passenger for the delay, plus massive punitory damages to those who were arrested and assaulted without cause. <h> Mister Aloha <p> I agree! Freedom is earned, if they do n't like how America operates, then move back to your home country. We are not holding them back if they want to leave. North Koreans can not leave their country even if they wanted to. That 's how that country lives. So leave if you do n't like America. One Nation Under GOD!!! God Bless with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. " <p> Freedom is another word for Liberty. Now, if the unalienable right to Liberty is granted by our Creator, how can it be earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?!??!! What planet are you from? And if " they " do n't like the way American operates they should leave? First you 're assuming that " they " are immigrants, and second, the whole point of democracy and liberty are totally at odds with your whole statement. I think perhaps you need to open your eyes to the fact that not all brown people were born outside of the USA, that the constitution guarantees them the rights you feel they should " earn "( what have YOU done to earn YOUR freedom?), and also backs up the peoples rights to speak out, mobilize, organize and work towards change, not just be forced to leave. The whole POINT of the constitution is to protect the american people from oppressive, tyrannical rule and protect them from over reaching government, that is why America was formed, and the founding fathers would have told your royalist ass to get back to Britain if they heard you talking that kind of nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been, a United States citizen. She was born here. I 'm sick of all the people telling her to " go back to her home country " when... she 's already there. In the country that she loves. <p> And, by saying " freedom is earned ", thanks for letting us know you slept through your high school government class. <h> Marnie <p> Na, I always take a long time in the bathroom -- for-ev-er -- and I 've never been questioned, handcuffed, strip searched, or even spoken to about it... Of course not -- I 'm white.( Nice try.) <p> Also, I 'm not trained in any sort of law enforcement, or even flight attendant protocol... But I 'm sure that I could have easily, nicely, asked the gentleman if he was feeling okay, or needed anything -- and found out right away whether he was actually doing something which warranted further investigation. We all watch too many hollywood movies with dumbed-down characters, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything, and get themselves killed by ignoring every possible sign of real concerns -- for the sake of drama... We seem to have lost all faith in our own perception, and live in fear of what our imaginations can conjure up. <p> Let 's not forget that the incidents of 9/11/01 were very, very rare -- and unlikely to happen again in this country in any one of our -- or our grandchildren 's lifetimes -- even without strip searches after planes land. <h> Blue Pattern <p> " Tt( sic) seems to me that all you people are forgetting or overlooking one fact the reason that the plane was stopped was because the two men were taking an excessively long time in the bathrooms,... " <p> So, by this reasoning, an airline passenger who happens to have dark skin or a foreign accent( or both) could and likely would be reported for " suspicious activity " by a " loyal American " passenger who is irritated about having to wait their turn while the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that typically takes longer. <p> Right. Now I understand. Using the toilet while looking or sounding different is a " suspicious activity. " <h> I support Rationality <p> I understand the attraction of trying to make a comparison between early Nazism and today 's America, but it is not possible to compare the CAUSE of the events of 9/11/11 with the cause of Hitler 's hysteria. There was no catastrophic terrorist event that led Hitler to uber-nationalism and his extreme hatred of the Jews. To compare those situations almost seems like justifying Hitler 's actions. We have reason to fear terrorists. We just should not assume that all brown-skinned people are terrorists. Hitler 's hatred of Jews was pure bigotry. <h> Scojam <p> Sorry David but Laura was describing a process by which rights are lost and governments becomes the ultimate all seeing authority and citizens lose all recourse. You ca n't compare the USA with Nazi Germany or Soviet Union Communism of course but she was n't doing that. Laura was describing a process that certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change that process writers like Laura will be able discuss valid similarities with those regimes. It 's not there yet but it 's coming. <h> SHM1026 <p> David, thank you for mentioning that. It drives me up a wall how many times people try to equate Nazism with something going on in America today. The plain truth is that there is NOTHING that even comes close. Comparing something in America with Nazism is part of Glenn Beck 's schtick, and it is just plain ignorant. Since 9-11, we have had to take extraordinary measures to protect ourselves ; and so far, we are proving to be lousy at doing it gracefully. <h> Liz <p> PLEASE do n't even TRY to equate what you may have experienced from authorities to what the author experienced. Just stop it. You did not ever experience anything like what she did. " Required my personal information, " indeed. Yeah, they required her personal information, alright. <h> Shanna <p> Yeppers. I am so tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities provide. Freedom always comes at a price. I was once checked at an airport for drugs. And I have blonde hair. But I was dressed as a hippie, coming from sf and I realized this and moved on. It was no big deal. Grow up, miss shebhi. The only person who has a problem with your Arab background is you. <h> jenojeno <h> Allison <p> You were handcuffed and taken off a plane, strip and cavity searched, and interrogated? I doubt it. You miss the point -- " freedom " includes freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures( Constitution) and the right to confront one 's accuser( also, Constitution). <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Good call, Allison. These three people need to be able to confront their accuser/s. And yes, being detained for hours, handcuffed, strip-searched does not compare to random " checks " for drugs. Let 's see how these people like a TSA officer getting gloved and sticking their fingers up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> Joe Jericho <p> Allison, I think you should ease up on Shanna. She is ok with it because Obama did it. Now, if Bush had been doing this, she probably would have torched something herself. It 's hard dealing with ideologues. <h> Katiebug <p> " Illegal searches and seizures " is not relevant to this case because of the Patriot Act. It 's law, whether fair or not. <p> Nor is the " right to confront one 's accuser ". That 's in court, when you 're being tried for a crime. She did not make it that far into the judicial system because she was charges were not pressed and she was released. Again, fair or not, it is still law. <h> Allison <p> Thank you Katie. I did read in another post the changes that have been made in the interpretation of our Constitutional rights under the Patriot Act, and realize that that particular part of my argument is flawed. <p> I think the Patriot Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem here, as well as the interpretation of that Act by the authorities involved. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> The patriot act can not make something that is unconstitutional suddenly acceptable under the constitution. To my knowledge this can only happen in one of two ways. <p> 1) The one we are taught about in highschool government class is an amendment to the constitution itself. The patriot act is a law passed by the legislative branch and signed into law by the executive branch, not a constitutional amendment. Thus the patriot act does not change the constitutionality of these searches. <p> 2) The second is through interpretation of the constitution by the Judicial branch. Parts of the Patriot act have already been deemed unconstitutional by the Judicial branch. I hope that Shoshana takes this to court, because I want to know for certain whether the detaining, strip-searching, and interrogation of the three people on this flight is deemed constitutional or not. <p> I fully expect Shoshana and the two others involved to be given substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutionallity of the detainment, searching, and interrogation. <h> Allison <h> Stacy <p> Oh come on. You were once checked at an airport? You ca n't relate to this woman. Unless you can say you were handcuffed, thrown in the back of a car, stripped searched, and fingerprinted- then you should shush. I am tired of people having no sympathy anymore. <h> Marnie <p> Shanna, you apparently smoked way too much pot during your hippie days in San Francisco. You were probably too stoned to bother arguing, and the weed seems to have either dulled your sense of perception, stripped your ability to read, or vaporized your sense of empathy. Did you even read this post by Mrs. Hebshi?( Obviously not, because calling her ' miss shebhi ' is too far off the mark for you to have actually understood what she wrote.) Furthermore, it occurs to me that the only relevance of your blonde hair, is the senseless comment you made. Rest up, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shanna, may I ask why you were checked for drugs at an airport. Was this at customs or the TSA. The mission statement of the TSA has nothing to do with drugs, unless they present a threat to airline safety. If you were checked specifically for drugs at a TSA checkpoint than that is a direct violation of your rights as it is not part of the executive search privlages granted to protect the traveling public. Instead it is a warentless and suspicionless search for evidence of a crime. This is expressely prohibited and a direct violation of the fourth amendment. <p> I was also not aware that my freedoms are provided by authorities. I was under the impression that my freedoms were god given and unalianable. Or is that just what some old irrelevent document states. Perhaps if you spent some time edjucating yourself you would not believe that your rights and safety are entirely in the hands of authorities. <p> To tell someone who was handcuffed, detained, strip-searched, and interrogated based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow up is insensitive and selfish. <h> B. Perry <p> Thanks Laura, Eric Hoffer, a longshoreman philosopher wrote a book called " True Believer " that studied the very question of how the people in Germany in the 1930s, the most well educated country in Europe could descend into becoming a nation of people that supported its Nazi government. The book is one of the best books I 've ever read and if anyone wants to gain more understanding of why we as a nation have become what we have, this book offers some insights. Let 's hope we descend no further as that future, if it happens, will cause us to live through a greater real nightmare than we can imagine. <h> Theobromine <p> " A. Corrupt the young, get them away from religion. Get them interested in sex. Make them superficial, destroy their ruggedness. <p> " B. Get control of all means of publicity and thereby ; " 1. Get people 's minds off their government by focusing their attention on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 2. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance. " " 3. Destroy the people 's faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up to contempt, ridicule and obloquy. " " 4. Always preach true democracy but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible. " " 5. By encouraging government extravagance, destroy its credit, produce fear of inflation with rising prices and general discontent. " " 6. Foment unnecessary strikes in vital industries, encourage civil disorders, and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government toward such disorders. " " 7. By specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues : honesty, sobriety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness. " <p> " C. Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a view to confiscating them and leaving the population helpless. " <p> NOTE : " The above " Rules for Revolution " were secured by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party, who acknowledged it to be still a part of the Communist program for overthrowing our Government " <h> Silly <p> Oh, that 's actually a completely fictional account. You can spot this because it 's written in the words an American trying to bash communists would use, not those a communist would use. <p> No communist would use " natural ruler ", for example, because there is no " natural ruler ". In fact... no real democratic person would use the phrase, either, because there ARE no " natural rulers " in a democracy. <p> So whoever wrote this most likely was a fascist or royalist. Good job eating up Nazi propaganda. <h> Isla <p> Laura, so, so true. I do think the day is coming when we wake up and find " the muzzle in place, the chains permanently attached. " I believe we will see it within the next 30 years... the mechanisms are already in place, and we are either not seeing, or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was NOT arrested, her liberties were not limited and her rights were fully intact. <p> if she really believes all that -- then get a lawyer and let 's see what happens. <p> i doubt very seriously, she will get far.( but hey -- go for it!!!!) many of us, of ALL backgrounds have been through similar circumstances since 9-11 and respect and honor the work of Homeland Security. <p> If some of you would actually learn how many horrific acts of terrorism have been thwarted since then -- and how many thousands of lives have been saved -- you would be singing a different tune. <p> Oh... and let me guess. None of YOUR relatives had a full-bodied airliner smash into their office 10 years ago or had to choose between burning alive or jumping 85 stories to concrete below. Just a guess. <p>( you may want to listen to betty ong 's 911 call from that day -- just to get a taste of what she and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVERY single passenger and flight attendant was concerned about these men and their behavior? Maybe this woman 's non-action when it was obvious to everyone else something was amiss.... raised a red flag. <p> The fact that THIS woman may have been doing EXACTLY what you seem to detest " sitting by and doing NOTHING " -- while they very well could have been trying to blow up the plane -- speaks volumes about your own bias. <h> Allison <p> Please post links to stories of passengers of all ethnicities, especially ones that are different from Ms. Shebshi 's, being handcuffed, detained, strip searched, and interrogated for hours before being released. <p> Please post some information about acts of terrorism that have been prevented with the use of these techniques. Surely there are some? <p> Do not dishonor the 9/11 dead by invoking their names to justify the actions here. You cheapen their death by using them in that fashion. <h> Gino <h> Diane <p> In defense of the authorities, if it were n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have a LOT MORE terror in this country. Because people would KNOW, that we are too laid back and they could get away with terrorizing our country more than they do now. I 'm sorry for what happened to Shoshana, but if it were me I would not have known that the authorities were just doing their jobs. <h> Andrea <p> Diane, although I disagree with you, I would be willing to consider this argument if the " authorities " could provide a shred of evidence that this type of abuse of power and harassment of American citizens actually prevented real terrorism. <h> Heywood <p> Why are you blaming " the authorities??? " In this instance, they were simply RESPONDERS. It was the PASSENGERS ON THE PLANE who fingered that row of " suspicious looking characters " -- the authorities were only acting on information they received. Would you prefer that the " authorities " ignore all reports, because some of them may have come from idiots who let their prejudices inform their decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a report do what police officers do when they receive a report -- ask many questions of the REPORTER to determine the validity of the report BEFORE questioning the accused. Cops do n't interrogate in this manner every single person against whom a report is made, and Homeland Security should n't, either. <p> And I would prefer the questioning not violate someone 's Constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure, and the right for the accused to face his or her accuser. <h> Erylin <h> Lizabeth <p> Well said Allison. While reading the original blog i imagined myself as her. If i am who i am now, but with darker skin, I would still want those basic protections. I wonder if this( my) country would still be like it is today if the attackers on 9/11 had been caucasian. just saying that we would be enraged that our **25;5777;TOOLONG were being strip searched. And before people spout off on this about " they shouldnt come to this country "... neither should you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way our government is running it now even native americans are being targeted and searched... they were here before ANY of us. <h> Chance <p> Allison, you are wrong. The crew and pilot had to make the decision that there might be suspicious activity on the plane. The cops going into that situation, of course would protect themselves and those onboard. Think about this.... they are going into a plane blindly. If indeed there was a terrorist and they went to question them, do you think maybe the terrorist could have overpowered the cop? Now the terrorist has a gun and a plane and boom.... everybody is dead and 9/11 is relived. Cops can detain you for whatever reason. It is charging unwrongfully is the problem. In this situation, no one was charged with a crime. It 's better to be safe than sorry. It is sad she had to go through this, but it was because of everybody 's paranoia aboard the plane. The authorities are not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough time to have dinner with everybody and ask questions like in a who dun-it movie. that day there were threats of " something " happening so the responders were n't waiting. <h> Mary <h> Naren <p> Exactly. Did someone consider the plane had not blown up or hijacked yet? Hello, Good Morning? It did land safely even with those three brown terrorists conspiring all the time and two of them spending a little more time in the bathroom than usual( and returning back to their seats without guns or bombs in their hands). Did these ' Authorities ' consider nothing was done by anyon eto thwart their( our ' terrosisits ') efforts, but just some ' suspicious ' activity reported ; so it can not be ' as ' serious? <p> So even if this was reported, this could have been handled in a completely different way. There 's no point in subjecting them to such such cells and treatments. They have handed over their information to you, did not blow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so will not do it when they 're in your facility surrounded by all half the military. Do your investigation and treat them respectfully. If you say 50 such incidents were reported through the day, be mature enough to consider this could be another of those and handle it well! <h> Gump <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Indeed, Allison. When a magician performs a magic trick, they use some diversion so that peoples ' eyes do n't catch the magic in the trick. Maybe the accuser was diverting the attention off of themselves onto these three people. I think it only fair that the reporter should have been detained and interrogated, too, and also these three people need to be able to confront this accuser. <h> avery <p> maybe this woman 's protesting is a " diversion " to what she was really up to. So far, she 's been caught in a number of different lies.( look up homeland security reports for december 2010 -- what she said happened then -- did not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon on a plane and mocked security when they failed to find it. <p> she 's not very good at covering her motives. i 'm sure it 's obvious to others, as well, which is why she will be targeted and followed for the rest of her life -- THANK GOD!! <h> avery <p> you mean, like the " crew "? which includes the pilots and flight attendants? <p> " after the CREW REPORTED that two people were spending " an extraordinarily long time " in a bathroom, Frontier spokesman Peter Kowalchuck said. " <p> The CREW reported it -- the CREW( not some " random " passengers) -- the TRAINED CREW! <p> you really need a LESSON in flight protocol and Homeland Security -- you seem to be the ONLY person flying who does n't seem to understand that what the CREW SAYS goes..... no matter what. If you do n't like it -- do n't fly. <p>( you can always exercise you constitutional right to VOTE and lobby and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you like to complain too much to actually do anything about what you like to complain about -- an affliction many who have nothing better to do seem to have) <h> Allison <p> Apparently the crew needs better training, since none of the 50 or so people identified as " acting suspiciously " on 9/11/11( according to the reports I 've read, and including Ms. Shebshi) were found to be guilty of anything. <p> I think there 's a middle ground between " the crew can say anything and they will be believed no matter what " and " nobody can report anything ever. " I would like to see that middle ground include having the crew making the report have to provide specific and reasonable grounds for their suspicions, grounds that are more concrete than " I thought he was in the bathroom too long. " <p> I have voted in every federal, state, and local election since I was 18. I also frequently lobby for political causes and candidates that share my beliefs. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs or my participation in this discussion to anyone, including you. <h> Tom Lange <p> Unfortunately, history suggests that it does. Not that I defend it, or believe it, but the camps that Asian Americans were put into on the West Coast-were done to prevent an attack. They can look back and say : " It worked, did n't it? " <p> People defend the atrocity that is the Patriot Act, and argue that we have n't had any terrorist attacks since, and reason that Bush did a good job... <p> -Of course, the number of terrorist attacks in this country is so small that it makes a 10 year window completely meaningless. Some people will find meaning it it, however... <h> Shelly <p> For one thing, No one can prevent terrorism but the proof is in the pudding to coin a phrase... We have had ZERO terrorists attacks since 9/11 because of the publics awareness &; reports coupled with our Authorities responding quickly &; thoroughly! So you must consider this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignoring evil is n't an option, our Government has the obligation to Protect ALL of its citizens. So " For the greater good " becomes one of thee most important points for all of us to remember and understand. With this information I hope our government learns from this incident and improves the system for our civil rights and our protection too. <h> Ian <p> See, the purpose of terrorism is to cause exactly this. " Terrorism " is n't about killing people -- it 's about terrorizing. That 's why it 's called " terrorism " and not " killing-people-ism. " <p> Killing people is a means to an end. The end is to destroy a society, by breaking down the rule of law and social contract. And we do this better than any other nation on Earth. We 've gone from a light unto the nations, a place which may not have always done the right thing, but was always on the right path, to a place that is an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And why? Because we have reacted in exactly the way that al Qaeda was hoping. <p> In doing so, we 've proven that we are a PERFECT target for terrorism. A terrorist who attacks the United States gets EXACTLY the goal they want : a repressive, over-zealous, fascist security force which destroys the freedom and liberty that this country once had. <p> Once upon a time, people thought that " freedom " was a thing that you were willing to risk your life to fight for. This country was founded on the notion that you had to risk your security to guarantee your freedom -- and that that is a bargain well worth making. <p> Now? We trade in all our freedom for a tiny bit of security, the act of a craven coward. And we harm other people in the process. <p> I am ashamed to be a citizen of a country where three people could be detained like that, because someone was afraid. Terrorism requires people to be terrified. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to harm their fellow citizens because of their own terror. <h> TheCrapMan <h> Ralph Baker <p> Ian, If you are ashamed to be an American Citizen, You have the right to LEAVE on the next thing smokin. I do nt agree with a lot of what happened in Detroit and I also have no solution to offer. Our lives as Americans have changed considerably in the last 10 years. I will still stand behind the troops and my Commander -in -Chief, whom I diagree with on many levels, because it is my Duty as an American to do so. I have rights and Freedoms due to the every day Heroism of the troops that protect me. If your ashamed, find a Country that you can contribue to and get on the next flight. You will not be missed. <h> Michele W. <h> Glenn <p> I Put my mom, my sister or daughter in this position and I am horrified!! I am a 4th generation American, and what ever words this poor helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was in far better taste than I would use. WE THE PEOPLE are terrorizing our own people <h> JenRo <p> Extremely well articulated and very accurate, in my opinion. I am ashamed of what happened to Soshana and what she had to endure. The Patriot Act is unpatriotic and those who deny this are looking at the world with blinders on. Something is not better than nothing if any crackpot or bigot can see to it that innocent citizens are stripped of their rights in the name of security. We are no more secure, merely a terrorized nation that has failed to learn from history. Many of these comments make it obvious that too many of us consider propaganda fact. <h> Lara <p> Well said, Ian. Very well said. I particularly like the distinction between " terrorism " -- causing terror, and " killing-people-ism " -- causing the death of people. When did we decide that our freedoms, as Americans, were n't worth it anymore? <p> I am so sorry about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others whose stories have not been told. I am reminded of this poetic quote by the German Pastor Martin First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out -- because I was not Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak -- because I was not a they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out was not a Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out -- because I was not Then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak out for me. <p>... and I wonder, as Americans sixty years later, who are the groups we silently watch be persecuted? Are we asking ourselves ' who will be left when they come for me? ' In closing, I ask, when will we, as a collective conscience for America, find our voice and remember when freedom came with a price? <h> Mister Aloha <p> One question to all you that feel America was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family or friend in the 9-11 tragedy? Did all those people ask to die the way the did? NO! I am sorry she had to go through that, but like she said herself, " I wo n't be flying on 9-11 any more. " Hello?! It 's the 10th anniversary and she wonder 's why? They were on heightened security..... what does that mean to you??? There was evidence that there were plans to do something on the anniversary??!! Hello?! You folks seem NOT to be listening. A thief but comes in the night. If you knew when the thief was coming, then no more burglaries.... If we knew when terrorist was going to hit, no problem...... but we do n't so we have to be very cautious........ I am truly sorry this happended to you( Shebhi) but this is not the seventies or sixties... we are at WAR! We need to keep ALL Americans safe from harm...... our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our freedom..... FREEDOM IS NOT FREE! <h> jen <p> few people are ' terrorized ' here that i know of. I fly all the time and do n't feel at all " terrorized ". no one I know feels " terrorized " <p> What I do feel.... is SAFE! <p> I feel FREE and GRATEFUL to be an American and have an abundance of freedoms. <p> I 'm grateful for the security we have in place -- i 've been singled out, too( searches, extra security, etc.... and i 'm not being profiled... i 'm being screened. see, i 'm not biased in my own thinking) <p> I consider it a minor inconvenience..... as there are MORE important things in life.... like.... LIVING!( and not being bogged down by over-analyzing flight security). <p> This was a one-off occurrence( and it happened on the 10th anniversary of 9-11) and the flight crew acted out of an abundance of caution - i hardly consider ONE time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Allison <p> Searches and extra security are not the equivalent of being handcuffed and removed from a plane, detained for hours without communication, strip searched( and likely cavity searched, based on Ms Shebshi 's statements), and interrogated. That is not a minor inconvenience. It does not matter that this " only " happened once to Ms. Shebshi, since racial profiling is not acceptable. <h> Allison <h> Shelly <p> Everyone forgets, Flying is NOT a constitutional right, it is optional! If you do nt like the security requirements, then do n't fly. But as soon as the Government fails to see something coming or the citizens just believe they did nt do enough after a disaster( ie : Katrina) then everyone is up in arms complaining, calling for congressional witch hunts and wanting the government to answer/pay for its mistakes! Since the very beginning of this Republic, the founding fathers DID delegate the responsibility of Defense &; Security to our Government! Our Government was not sopose to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its citizens, those are individual, community &; local responsibilities! But Defense and Security is solely the Governments responsiblity! <h> John <p> At no point were Constitutional rights ever surrendered. When you board an airplane, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions the airlines have described on the back of the ticket. Flying is not a right, it is a privilege. There is nothing in the bill of rights that says every person in America has the right to fly commercial. <p> It is a simple decision for anyone to make, if you do not agree with the measures the airline security and authorities are allowed to take then DO NOT FLY COMMERCIAL. <p> Also, unfortunately you can not pick a different airline, because every carrier has to conform to the same rules set out by the different Government organizations. <p> To that end, I do not ever want to be singled out like Shoshana was. It is degrading and humiliating. But, let us be honest with ourselves. How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or that somehow that person looked suspicious in your neighborhood? These are reactions that we have been taught to think, because they are healthy for human preservation. <p> We can sit here and argue about whether the assumptions of the crew of the airplane were warranted or not. But what it really comes down to is the question of whether the Pros outweigh the Cons. The crew can not be afraid to make decisions like this when the entire plane is at risk. <h> Allison <h> Floyd <p> Do n't you think that if these people were going to blow the plane up they would have done it before they were yanked off of the plane? Why go to all the trouble to board an airplane with an explosive, only to be detained after the flight lands and is quarantined? The time to stop a terrorist is not after the plane lands. Terrorists may not be entitled to legal representation, but these people were. Being suspected of something, no matter how evil, does not trump the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The people running this country are idiots. <h> Finisterre <p> I suspect, Sally, that if you had been hauled off a plane, arrested and strip-searched because someone thought you 'd gone to the toilet a few too many times, you would be ' very upset and screaming bloody murder ' about your Constitutional rights, not concluding that ' not flying ' was a sensible response. <h> Steve Bock <p> I hope that you are " detained " for our general and unspecified safety in the near future. Might give you some perspective on the supposed necessity of false arrest, unlawful detention, and criminal mistreatment. <p> " if you do n't like it do n't fly " = terrorism wins again. This process is the wrong way to go about offering any protection from terrorism. If American citizens can be detained for hours, strip searched, apparently body cavity searched, and questioned without probable cause other than the word of another person who is suspect of their activities, then terrorism can chalk up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search warrant for the strip search and body cavity search. What did they expect to find on these people who had already been through the TSA checkpoint before they got onto the plane. Detaining a suspected person AFTER their flight has landed is very poor and very late security. If they were going to do something, do n't you think the misdeed would already have been accomplished? I 'm all for profiling before people get into a plane and before the flight, Pull anyone aside that stands out from the profiling and question them further. I am against the current TSA and Homeland Security policies that are in place right now. In my opinion, the authorities here have trashed the Constitution with their processes for trying to find any would be terrorists. <h> David <p> The plane had already landed at its destination, so I do n't get where you 're going with that assumption. What 's necessary is for the authorities to actually conduct an investigation into the accusations, and not assume that the reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't appear the way someone believed Americans should look. The threat was long over once the flight had landed. That was the time to test the veracity of the accuser, not ramp up the violations of the rights of those accused with what we now know was no basis in fact. I 'm betting that if this were you, you 'd have a very different take on one surrendering their civil rights for the sake of the unsubstantiated accusations of others. <h> Joe <p> Is this what the face of tolerant liberalism looks like, redheadwglasses? You do n't agree with me, so leave? You 're a " xenophobe, " so leave so that we can have a uninformly tolerant society? <p> I think Diane was making a reasonable point, and that point is that sometimes a vigorous response is necessary to prevent violence, save lives and protect public servants. This is n't always the case, and invariably mistakes are made and it takes too long to sort out that everything is okay. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's something we should strive to eliminate but can never totally end in a world in which there are bad and good people who can be mistaken for one another in the heat of a moment. <p> Someone else said in this post that when police respond to a complaint, they ask questions of the complaintaint first before questioning the suspect, and in a situation in which there is clearly no threat to the officer or the public, this is certainly the case. But if an officer is summoned to a scene in which a reasonable person, lacking first-hand context, could construe poses an imminent threat of violence, I can assure you the officer will secure the suspect and perhaps even the complaintant until he or she can sort out what 's really going on. <p> It 's well established law, and common sense, that police have the right and in many cases the responsibility to secure and restrain suspects for their own safety and that of the public, the suspect and any victims. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this. Why? Because our system is better than *their* system, as flawed as it may be. <p> In our system, we investigate facts and release detained individuals with an apology and a ride back to their car. <p> In other systems, do n't have the freedom to live Tweet their detention on suspicion of terrorism, suspects are beaten mercilessly until they confess to crimes they did not commit, are simply charged and convicted in sham show trials or summarily executed without so much as consideration of guilt or innocence merely because they are come from the " wrong " part of the world or believe in the " wrong " God. These things happen here, too, but they are the exception, not the rule. <p> Our system is not perfect. It bears the constant vigilance of an educated citizenry to prevent the inevitable excesses of power from gaining irreversible hold on our freedoms. And it must be protected from the paranoid and misinformed imaginings of a terrified people. <p> But our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villified and pilloried for responding and investigating and coming to a reasonable and lawful conclusion that no laws were broken, for apologizing for causing an inconvience and for releasing a detained individual as quickly as possible. <p> This incident, as frightening and instructive as it is for both the writer and law enforcement( and there are lessons for both), is not indicative of a system run amok, but is rather evidence that ours is a system in which laws, not the prejudices of men, ultimately triumph. <p> I 'm sorry for the writer 's inconveniences, and I 'd like to think I 'm wordly enough that I would not have mistaken the innocent bathroom habits of two foreigners for a mortal threat. <p> But it 's hard for me to say exactly how I might respond when, 35,000 feet in the sky, with the ominous warnings of a credible terrorist threat issued by my democratically elected government thundering in my head, I am faced something out of the ordinary as the sweet face of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm sorry for the inconvience and fear this woman and these two gentlemen suffered. In a perfect world, I 'd wish it on no one. At the same time, I ca n't fault the public servants who also just wanted to go home to their own families and who apparently worked diligently to clear these individuals and send them on their way. <p> Maybe, but this is merely conjecture on your part without foundation? What if everyone on every plane points a finger at each other everywhere? So does it make it right for everyone to be strip searched all over this country? What I 'm saying is someone falsely stated that " suspicious activity " was taking place when this was not the case by this ladies statements here which seem very valid. It does have the appearance of being tied to skin color which is profiling and that is wrong. Did they strip search the person that made those statements? This could amount to a hate crime. They clearly landed the plane without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be conducted over less measures that would prove her innocence? Its clear she was guilty by the strip search and not being givin ' information about why she was being taken from the getgo. I 'm somewhat surprised at your answer but I 'll bet you have n't been stripped searched without being given a reason why. When it happens to you, you 'll know how this woman felt. <h> Lance <h> Joe Jericho <h> Liz <p> Really, Diane? Really? If we did n't strip-search innocent CITIZENS for NO REASON, we 'd have more terror attacks? Can you point me to some information that says that the naked photos and genital groping that we are subject to every time we fly has actually caught would-be terrorists? ' Cause so far TSA has n't advertised anything about actually stopping terrorists. Your reaction is EXACTLY the proof that the terrorists have won, because you would be just fine with being imprisoned and strip-searched for no reason. They have won because people like you think it is OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won because you are OK with the fact that we have lost our freedoms in the name of " security. " <p> Whilst I agree that others who may have ideas about committing acts of terrorism may be discouraged due to the heavy security activities that have been active for the last decade, I do think that this is the only way in which terrorism is thwarted by this system. I am reasonably sure that she should have at least been responded to before she was taken to the security office and been informed why she was being detained by the police in handcuffs. Pretty sure everyone has the right to have the answer to that. I am an Aussie and something I find interesting is that when we go to the the airport I always seem to be " randomly " targeted for bomb or illegal substance testing( for anyone that does not have this it is a non-evasive procedure where they simply rub some cloth over your hands, clothes and lining of your bag and test it). I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have asked why I always seem to be approached for this, mostly I am just told it is random. Then my friend started dating a guy that works for customs and he said it is because I look non-threatening, like I would n't make a fuss and that they are discouraged from approaching people of Arab appearance or women wearing cultural clothing as it might cause an incident of accusations of racism. Interesting!!! They would rather not cause a scene and risk a bomb getting on the plane all for a simple swab test. This was around the same time that an informant let the police know that they believed a person dressed in a burqa would conceal explosives under the garment and would target a " hub " in Sydney city. I am so so sorry for what happened to you, it was just WRONG, plain and simple. You have every right to feel violated and I hope that the support of your friends and family helps you through this time. <p> There apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acting from suspicion, and perpetrating said same in the name of protection from suspicion. I think we as Americans must be just as vigilant against the erosion of our rights and freedoms as we are against the terrorists who try to do great damage to our country. Otherwise, we will end up doing their work for them. I believe Shoshana 's experience was a terribly unfortunate example of the authorities accomplishing just that. Those of us who are, or who look, white, are not inclined to reflect back on our history at what the authorities have considered to be meet and seemly behavior, " just doing their jobs ". Ask one of our Native American or African American( and there are other groups as well) what " acting on suspicion " meant to them. Ask an African American today what " Driving While Black " means to them. How we strike the balance is an extremely difficult thing. But the " LOT MORE " terror in this country could start to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much room for interpretation. Sitting idly by, in the name of " the authorities were just doing their jobs " and watching the Shoshanas of our American family be mistreated is unacceptable. Where do you propose we draw the line for that? <h> Penny <p> I agree. Maybe if they had done this 10 years ago we would n't have lost thousands of people to a senseless act. Unfortunately terrorists do n't wear a sign saying they are a terrorist and the authorities have to guess. It 's sad because even women and children can be a terrorist among the radical groups. I 'm sorry Shoshana had to experience this but it was for the safety of thousands. We are not disturbed by events but by the view we take of the events. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> Maybe if they had waited until the plane landed safely, directed it to move away from the terminal after it had already been there, boarded the plane with a SWAt team, and detained three people who had not done aything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the criminals on 9/11 had decided to forget their plan and allow the plane to land safely. Of course, if they did that then they would not have committed any crime as the possesion of box cutters was not against the rules of flying at that time. <p> " Unfortunately terrorists do n't wear a sign saying they are a terrorist and the authorities have to guess. " <p> Are you really comfortable with the authorities simply guessing as a reason to detain, strip-search, interrogate, and fingerprint random people? <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> It took me a minute to grasp the implications of your statement, so I will have to post a second time. <p> " Unfortunately terrorists do n't wear a sign saying they are a terrorist and the authorities have to guess. " <p> since terrorist are criminals I can change that one word and the meaning changes. <p> Unfortunately criminals do n't wear a sign saying they are a criminals and the authorities have to guess. <p> So if an authority guesses I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched, interrogated, fingerprinted, and if this produces no evidence against me released with an appology. No probable cause required? <p> So if an authority guesses I am a theif, I get hauled in, strip searched, interrogated, fingerprinted, and if this produces no evidence against me released with an appology. No probable cause required? <h> Chris <h> thankful <h> Alice <p> Diane, it is a matter of HOW action is taken. I agree with Scojam that this is a systematic process by which we are gradually desensitized into compliance for our " safety ". There are ways to interrogate or question people that do not violate their rights as US citizens. <h> tb <p> i agree diane! tough shit! these people are doing their jobs, and I 'm thankful for it. if it were me I would be grateful that they were on alert, and not be whining about security measures put in place to protect the American people! if you do n't like it, then next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that they were NOT doing their jobs CORRECTLY! They abused their discretion and I 'm willing to bet that if Shoshana were to consult with an Attorney, she will be successful in suing the Agents involved. <p> Perhaps, everytime I do a car stop for someone going through a stop sign, I should immediately pull them out of their car, search them, handcuff them, take them back to the station and strip search them. After all, they do present a threat to me, since I have to approach the car and I do n't know if they are armed with a weapon or not. <p> The people on the airplane at the very least have gone through a magnatometer to check them for weapons. Their bags were at the very least x-rayed. Their carry on was x-rayed as well so the probability that the people on the airplane having a weapon is extremely low. <p> On the other hand, the people that I pull over, have not been searched. Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think from now on, anyone going through a traffic light, stop sign or speeding will immediately be hadcuffed and strip searched to ensure my safety. At least the people I will be strip searching have done something wrong unlike Shoshana who was just sitting in her seat and minding her own business. I wonder how long I will be keeping my job? Gee, do you think TSA would hire me? I will be an experienced searcher! <h> VoiceOfReason <p> Right. So when the terrorists finally decide that flying is too much of a hassle, and that they 've won that front, the car bombings will start. <p> What then? Military checkpoints at all state borders? Travel plans filed between states with the National Transportation Safety Board, using it 's newly expanded powers under the Anti-vehicle Terrorism Act? <h> Ketil <p> Because, as we all know, there are no other ways of conducting terror than blowing up an airplane, after it has parked, on the ground, at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic rifle, and kill dozens of people at a political youth camp, nor to blow up subway systems, trains, or simply run a lot of people over with a car? <p> Are you seriously suggesting that confiscating toothpaste at airports deters or prevents any of this? Is fertilizer only sold from the trolley aboard aircrafts in your country? If not, why are n't we seeing a lot more terrorism? Where are all the suicide bombers? <p> The fact is that, in spite of the wars incited by America and it allies that have cost half to a million( mostly muslim) lives, there are very, very few people eager to sacrifice themselves in terrorist attacks, and approximately nobody with the means and faculties to pull off anything more than an IED in their own Iraqi or Afghan neighborhood. <p> All of the so-called security is part paranoia, and part theater for the paranoid. <h> Torus <p> It 's becoming clear to me that the public at large may not even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to make people fearful. Killing people is simply a means to an end, not the end result. <p> This country is terrified of being " terrorized ", so it just accepts these heightened security measures and subtractions of our inalienable rights without assuming anything bad will come of it, and also support the waging of a war against an idea( what in the world is a " war on terror ", anyway?). <p> By definition of " terror ", there is a LOT of it in this country. We are terrified of something that has little chance of actually happening when the serious threat in this country is an accident on the freeway. And, in this respect, al-Qaeda has succeeded. <h> Ken <p> More like the land of the willingly oppressed and home of the chicken. Which, I take it, is your point. Liberty is not for lily-livered sheep who are all too eager to surrender freedom for a( false) sense of security. But this does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested. Rather, it means that we have met the enemy -- and he is us( apologies to Walt Kelly). Or, as was famously said at another time, in the face of a different sort of threat, " We have nothing to fear, but fear itself. " Seems like a lot of people have forgotten that lesson. <h> penny <h> Steven <p> I think that what happened to Shoshana is absolutely horrible. It is very unfortunate that she had to go through such a traumatic and embarrassing event. However, I do believe that our governments security tactics since 9/11/2001, no matter how potentially unfair they have been, have been largely successful in protecting our country from further terrorist attacks in the 10 years since 9/11. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> " I do believe that our governments security tactics since 9/11/2001, no matter how potentially unfair they have been, have been largely successful in protecting our country from further terrorist attacks in the 10 years since 9/11. " <p> Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments security tactics " have been so successful? I am open to changing my view if presented with new information, so please provide support for you opinion in the form of facts and data. <h> Don Barnhart <h> Bob A. <p> It 's funny how people were not so suspicious of 20 something, white, anglo, christian men after the Oklahoma City bombing. That murderer killed hundreds of men, women, and children, but the residual racist paranoia was not there. The matter is that the media, through their use of such phrases as " Islamic Extremists " caused this sort of paranoia. Why did they not refer to McVey as " Anglo-Christian Extremist "? It is tag lines like this that lead folks to the kind of paranoia profiling that will probably be around for a long time. It is also the reason that young afro-americans can not walk down the street at night, without someone crossing the street to get away from them. I do n't believe that we are all racists. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ". <p> You are absolutely right. We will win the war against terrorism when our lives return back to what they were on September 10, 2001 and when the Homeland Security and TSA ceases to exist. Till that day we have not won the war. <h> laars <h> rohlik <p> the woman who was detained waa unfortunate incident, and she complained about racial profiling but at the same time talked about fat woman and men policeman that were rednecks, is this profiling?????? absouletly, we are so very luck we live in the best country in the world and people who are not comfortable here should leave. <h> Yoko <p> Maybe she did throw them into a stereotypical category based on what they looked like, but did she call " the authorities " on them and cause them to be subjected to the humiliation she went through? No. So, it 's probably not fair to call her a hypocrite. Also, I 'll bet she was in the worst mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is okay in this situation. And are you suggesting that innocent, decent American citizens whose rights are grossly violated and thereby made " uncomfortable "( an understatement in my opinion), should leave the country that they have a constitutional right to be in because they are unhappy with that kind of treatment? Interesting. Also, she did n't say anything about hating America or what it should stand for. She just did n't want to take the abuse she suffered at the hands of paranoid bigots lying down. And by paranoid bigots, I mean the ones who called in the authorities. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> I think her reply was restrained. She was way too polite in her description of them. You do realize this just happened to her? I would still be too angry about it to even post such a nice reply as she has posted. <h> Joe Jericho <p> She said she was an American, should she leave? Should she go to her father 's homeland and be abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with your point that she seemed to be engaging in the same behavior she accused them of, but she does n't have any power ; whereas, those government scum used their power to torment and make her life very difficult. Personally, I do n't think race is the dispositive factor here, but I think she is justified in thinking it may have played a roll and for throwing some anger towards those who did it to her. I can get past that. Can you, or do you want to play a gotchya game with the victim? Perhaps it was her own fault that she got raped. Geez.... <h> Matt <p> There are those of you who live under this dilusion of peace and understanding through tolerance and love. Then there are those of us who live with the reality of violence and hate on a level that you will hopefully never experience. While inconvenient, what happened to the author probably saved lives. These searches and detentions are n't designed solely to harass the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DETER suspicious and criminal activity. Reluctantly I feel obligated to mention also that 9/11 was not the only terrorist attack on the U.S. perpetrated by brown skinned individuals who happened to speak Arabic and read the Qur'an. With that said my sympathies are slim to the " racial profiling " problem that we( us redneck, speedboat driving, country music listeners) have. While noticing a car full of white kids in their early 20? s driving slowly through a known drug area may seem like " profiling " to you, to me it seems like college kids trying to score some weed.( marijuana is still illegal in most states by the way) Everyone here is free to say whatever we like on any forum we choose. We are also free to practice whatever brand of God we choose, just not at school or work or anywhere anybody who hears or sees you doing it will be offended.( this means all you middle class gun toting republican types) All of these freedoms have been provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have never appreciated the men and women who have been keeping the wolf away from your doorstep for all these years. Most of you have not served in the military, or gotten ready for work in the morning hoping that at the end of your shift you would still be alive. Neither have you given any thought to how many holidays, childrens birthdays and other hours upon hours these public servants sacrifice to keep your basic human freedoms alive. It is this last reason that makes me less sympathetic to the inconvenience of a few hours of questioning and the humiliation of a strip search. Before i climb back on my unicorn and ride off in to my world of kittens and jelly beans let me leave you with another thought. Somewhere in everyone 's not so distant past, an ancester of ours thought it wise to leave what ever shithole, third-world country they were born in to come to America to find a better life. If you feel that they were mistaken, and that we are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what ever land you were descended from. I assure you........ You Will Come Back.( if they do nt cut your head off on al jazeera you infidel) <h> Mac <p> 10 years is not too long ago. 20 years will be a ceremony instead of a memorial and all will forget what happen. The Terrorists never forget and will be patient enough for the " Americans " to let their guard down. Then, they will strike again. It 's a lose-lose situation no matter what the outcome. Had there been a real terrorist threat and the reaction was not the same, then everyone would be furious for letting something happen. Lucky for us all, there was no terrorist threat and everyone is safe and alive. Protocols have to be in place for protection. Does it suck for some? Yes. Was it racial in nature? Debatable. Wrong place wrong time with suspicious people sitting next to you. Nothing will ever be perfect and some " feelings " will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place there will be loopholes and a terrorist organization WILL find them. America is full of people who only know the " American Life " and have no clue to what is going on outside It 's borders( other than what the media want 's them to know). There are many cultures out there that would kill every American just because they do n't live the same culture. They do n't " love " and " care " like the American culture. There is no " talking them out of it " just like they ca n't " talk you into it ". It 's OK to be paranoid. Just do n't be stupid about it. I 'm not writing to offend. Just to shed a little reality. I only posted to the first post I saw. <h> Peter R <p> Thanks to Shoshana and all the comments for revealing this appalling incident. I wonder what the stories of the other " 50 incidents " are. In this case, it is frightening that the suspicions/paranoia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people -- and that some would say, well, that 's just post-9/11 life for you. Why is it that " law enforecement personnel had to be so rough and rude with no evidence other than the unknown " accusor 's " accusation? I feel humiliated and ashamed by their behavior, and I apologize to Shoshana and all others so treated for being part of citizenry that has allowed such things to happen. <h> Naren <p> I was wondering the exact same thing. I want to know more about those " 50 incidents ". what exactly was reported as ' suspicious '( just brown folks sitting next to each other?! and nothing else?) and how were they handled. Oh wait, we probably wo n't hear about them. <h> Joe Jericho <p> I agree and makes you wonder whether there should be a cause of action against either the reporter or, more likely, the government. I think it should be targeted to the government. Reporters should be encouraged to report, generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled it. Let 's be honest, this is all politically driven. No political party wants to preside over the next attack, so they have no problem brutalizing an " unimportant " citizen for the sake of saving their own necks. We need term limits for all, and you are only allowed to hold one public office during the course of your lifetime. Sort of like a " thank you for your public service, goodbye " sort of thing. <h> B.R. <h> Johnathane Dorane <p> You can get suspicious whenever you want, but you can not interfere with the rights of your fellow citizen without probable cause supported by oath or afirmation. <p> Do you walk down the sidewalk keeping an eye on everyone and your distance because they may have a gun that they are planning to put to your head? <p> Do you time peoples bathroom breaks when you are eating out? <p> Do you time your co-workers bathroom breaks? <p> Do you time your family members bathroom breaks? <p> Please explain to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have been possible to seperate the three individuals and ask them questions for a few minutes to determine that they were not a threat. There was never and still is no evidence that these three people represented a threat to anyone. <p> No the sad truth is white people are scared of what does n't look like them. this has been and will always be true sorry. I 'm not trying to be insensitve or disrespectful. They use the attack to justify their treatment of people who do n't look like them. it 's been a pattern throughout the history of america. I was once stopped by the police becausde they said they recieved a call that Ii was walking supiciously by a bank. I was on the side walk and it was cold outside so i had on a big jacket. I was coming home from a ballet rehersal i was being " real suspicious " I 'm sorry this happened to you I 'm sorry this happens to anyone. our problem is not terrorism it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wont began to address what can be done to keep from reacting out of fear <p> I am so sorry this happened to you. And glad you are willing to share the story. Too much of our daily lives are controlled by fear since 2001. We should be ashamed of a great many things which have occurred in the last 10 years. And Dallas is correct. In many ways, the terrorists did win. <p> i couldnt have said it better myself!! you are totally right, we need to stop sending our troops over there to be murdered and start focusing on our own country who has suffered tremendously due to the fact that we are making their country better. we need to fix us so we can help others. 10yrs have been long enough. Shoshana-im sorry you and the other two men had to go through this, but maybe something good will come of it!! take care and stay proud of America( even through the unAmerican instances). " what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwarde <p> Yes, the terrorists did win that day, and they are still winning, and they have nothing to do with the Middle East. All physical evidence at the World Trade Center points to controlled demolition as the cause of the collapse of 3 high rise buildings on 9-11-2001, and almost all physical evidence was ignored by the so called government investigations. Starting from that scientifically irrefutable conclusion, one needs now to ask, " Who were the terrorists? " Things will continue to degenerate until the events of a decade ago are investigated instead of covered up. <h> Pete <p> Our ' gift ' from Osama Bin Laden. Now you see what the real price is for his murdering acts on 9/11 : to make the U.S. an unwelcome place for all those people who chose freedom instead of sharia law, liberty instead of religious tyranny. <h> Libby <p> Shoshana -- I am really appauled at your response to the people who imprisoned you, and your lack of knowledge about your rights. The best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse. Tell them that you will not speak to them. If, on the first request they do not conduct you to the toilet, urinate in their cell. Be polite, and refuse, respectfully, to converse. The only way they can proceed is with your cooperation, unless you have really done something wrong and there is evidence. Do n't EVER willingly talk to a TSA or FBI agent. Just remain silent. There is no law which requires you to speak. Without any blame or accusation at you, this is the only way we will regain our rights -- not cooperating with those who exceed their authority. Respectfully, Charles Heller <h> Moose <p> I find this the saddest part of the acccount... a person who feels she is being racially profiled... speaking hatefully about " rednecks ", country music, and speed boats.... the descriptions of the white bald paunchy officers( find it hard to believe that in Detroit there was only 1 officer of color)... and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitey ". Yes, the terrorists have done a good job of dividing Americans and apparently the profiling goes both ways. Every civil rights movement has included millions of compassionate white Americans and as such a person I am offended. <h> X <p> Are you fucking kidding? She explained that she was so humiliated and angry that she began to feel that way( irrationally, because she was scared and ANGRY). You sound like one of the people who probably would have found her " suspicious. " <h> Yodamite <p> @X : I agree. The thing that baffles me is that, with everything this poor woman was put through, K.S. Schultz and Diane are most troubled by Shoshana 's silent reaction. As if getting handcuffed, strip-searched, and getting interrogated is a walk in the park. <h> Chris <p> and you sound like one of those people who wines all the time and complains about how you do nt have anything so you sit at home and wait on OBAMA to pull his magical bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allison <p> The Constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure, and the right to face her accuser. <p> And yes, in America, all white people have white privilege. Since other people in this comment thread have misunderstood that concept, here is a good website about what it is( it might not be what you think I mean) : http : **34;5804;TOOLONG.... <h> Linda <p> @allison i would so disagree. im as white as they come and i live in Texas and i cant get a job even at burger king because every spanish speaking immigrant gets it. even though i could understand and perform any job just the same if not better. SO EXCUSE ME, WHERE ARE MY " WHITE PRIVILEGES "????? do nt get me wrong, im not racist. but this is America and its the born and bred Americans that DO NOT get " privileges " <h> Markus <p> Right, because white people always get pulled off airlines and detained because they look a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jail cell at the time she wrote this, for no other reason than someone thought that by simply sitting in her seat during the entire flight, she was up to something, detained by a largely white collection of " authorities " from several branches of law enforcement and government, acting on laws passed by that government, put in place by a president whose largest demographic of voting supporters was white Southern voters. <p> So, try to understand why someone going through a cavity search while her husband has no idea where she is, might be a bit resentful of the type of person who supported the President who passed the laws that allowed this travesty to happen to an American citizen. <p> You think her noticing the color of the officers ' skin is racist? OK, fair enough. Let 's put you and your family on a boat, ship you across the ocean, and force you to work as manual labor for a few generations for a black population. They we 'll free your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your owners ' wars, so they can go on to be treated as a fraction of the worth of a black person, while being denied access to decent work, pay, civil rights, or education for another few generations. Then we 'll haul one of your descendants off an airliner one day thanks to a law passed by a black President, enforced by black police officers, because someone thinks they look a little too much like that white guy who did that terrible thing a decade earlier, and we 'll see if your **40;5840;TOOLONG... does n't notice the color of the man checking his colon for a bomb. <p> Then we can come back here and finish this discussion about what counts as racist in this country today. <h> AJ <h> Xanthoptica <p> In basketball, you make a point to " call the first foul. " It 's hardly surprising that a person of color who had clearly been detained for flying without being white might notice the racial or ethnic traits of the folks who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet. She did n't introduce race or ethnicity into the situation... but simply reacted to bald and mean-spirited racism. <h> Rachel <p> I would absolutely love to leave. Unfortunately, though, it 's a pain in the butt to move to another country, especially when I ca n't even find a job in the US with a bachelors degree( you need to have enough money to support yourself, or get a work visa which is sometimes pretty hard to do). <p> Also, I will not support policies blindly just because they are " our policies ". Sometimes they 're pretty stupid policies. Is n't that what the founding fathers wanted in the first place anyway? For freedom of speech and the right to disagree with the way the country is run? <h> Allison <h> zirjo <p> Rohlik.. she decided at that moment she would hate anything to do with Country music, and whatever comes along with it. In other words she hated the idea that white men was doing this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminds me of ignorance. Not race and this is what she meant. by using this words. As in many societies there is lacks of education and and most of all competence on what you do in this case is security the people taken this kind of jobs and you see it in every port the woman about 70 years old with no bladder only a bag on her side to hold her pee... but she must be searched because this is security or otherwise( I could loose my job excuse) Personnel taking this position are not the smart security force, you can think of them as untrained and not too smart but they could beat you if you resist, they do not know anything about privacy acts whatsoever very ignorant people that do things as if it was only one color in front of their eyes. I 'll tell you sometimes i had travel i noticed this people are so stupid on their search you can stand there and see their mistakes and think how many people could go trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal instruments into an airliner. Their job is completely unnecessary if there is another attack for sure will not be coming in an airliner any way. I appreciate authorities took a step towards security but this is done absolutely wrong. I hope that some day they can restore our liberties and stop scaring people throughout the whole USA. The so called( patriots) that call on these 3 are the 1st ignorant s.. the ones to follow are even more stupid.. till the bosses arrived FBI and others.... <h> Chucky <p> Rohlik, The point of a democracy is that if you hate the policies you are supposed to complain and work to change them. You are not supposed to just take it -- or leave, you are supposed to fix it. The government makes lots of mistakes, every day, some are badly written laws or policies, some are based on misinterpretation of the law, some are out of control bureaucrats. In this case, as noted above, someone was detained AFTER being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xrayed, magnetometered etc, and after the flight was over. This is bad policy, and it is an unreasonable search in custody without according rights required by the Constitution. If you think this is RIGHT, work to change the constitution, otherwise it is not legally justified, and it violates, rather than protecting Freedom. <h> Sarah S <p> I love it when illiterates with foreign names( from countries with Communist pasts) come and tell us Americans we should all leave the US if we insist on knowing our Constitutional rights- and complaining when they are violated... <h> KB <p> Completely agree with what you find to be the saddest part of this account. Understandably, she is upset by what happened to her, but she is really no different with her descriptions of the officers she interacted with. Would have been a much more powerful post if she, herself, could have risen above the very thing she is blogging against. <h> zirjo <p> KB.. she decided at that moment she would hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with it. In other words she hated the idea that white men was doing this to her. You know when someone refers as to rednecks that reminds me of ignorance. Not race and this is what she meant. by using this words. As in many societies there is lacks of education and and most of all competence on what you do in this case is security the people taken this kind of jobs and you see it in every port the woman about 70 years old with no bladder only a bag on her side to hold her pee... but she must be searched because this is security or otherwise( I could loose my job excuse) Personnel taking this position are not the smart security force, you can think of them as untrained and not too smart but they could beat you if you resist, they do not know anything about privacy acts whatsoever very ignorant people that do things as if it was only one color in front of their eyes. I 'll tell you sometimes i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their search you can stand there and see their mistakes and think how many people could go trough this isles and find dozens of ways someone could take illegal instruments into an airliner. Their job is completely unnecessary if there is another attack for sure will not be coming in an airliner any way. I appreciate authorities took a step towards security but this is done absolutely wrong. I hope that some day they can restore our liberties and stop scaring people throughout the whole USA. The so called( patriots) that call on these 3 are the 1st ignorant s.. the ones to follow are even more stupid.. till the bosses arrived FBI and others.... <h> Yodamite <p> Really? You thought her internalized emotional reaction to her oppressors was the saddest thing about her account -- a reaction that she owns up to at the end of the article? That 's what you walked away with? That 's Sad! <p> And, what an absurd false equivalency you try to create! Sorry, Shoshana was racially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil rights, false arrest, and a humiliating strip search, while the other leads to some dorks on the internet laughably comparing the plight of a southern white person to that of a racially-profiled minority. No, the profiling does NOT go both ways. A " redneck " does n't end up in a cell because someone thinks his twang is silly or disagrees with his taste in music. <p> She reacted the way she did because of the way she was treated. And, if you actually use your brain, you would see that she concludes the article with a message of tolerance that is aimed at everyone, including herself. <h> Guster <p> Southern, white, and a delicate flower, too! A very common combination. <p> Being detained, and strip-searched, and handcuffed -- completely baselessly -- is bad. But hurting my fee-fees is worse. Shame on Shoshana, indeed! I think the lesson she should take from this is that white men have her best interests at heart. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read an account of someone 's Constitutional rights being violated, and that person having an angry reaction toward the violators( which she owns up to), and dismiss the account because white feelings might possibly have gotten hurt. <p> Wow, Allison. Such a racist chip on your shoulder. Perhaps you should direct your complaints to the African-American president who endorses these violations. Those white Southern rednecks at DHS could do none of this without his authorization. And by the way, did n't she mention she was strip-searched by an African-American? Hmm. It seems to me like this issue is not so black and white as you would like it to be. In fact, I know just as many Latinas and African-Americans who profile the Hebshis and the Indian men of this world as terrorists, just as you are incorrectly profiling me right now. <p> What happened to this lady is a travesty perpetuated by a nation afraid of its own tall shadow. A nation being told by our President and Big Sis( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Something, Say Something. " Each of us Americans of every race is losing our freedom. This injustice will not be overcome if the primary concern of racist people is to prove that people of their specific color are the most persecuted. We ALL have a horse in this race, and sensible solutions will only prevail if we pull together and stop putting each other down. <h> Allison <p> It seems that you misunderstand my use of the term " white privilege. " It 's a concept from critical race theory, and it refers to the fact that in America, simply by being white, white people have privileges that others do not have. White is seen as the norm, while non-white is seen as the non-norm, the " other, " the abnormal. <p> It is white privilege, for example, to read a story about a non-white woman whose Constitutional rights are violated in a humiliating way, and then state that because that woman said some mean things about the people who humiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the poster named " John " stated. <p> The fact that non-white and white people were involved in the violation of Ms. Shebshi 's rights is not relevant to the concept of white privilege, nor is the implementation of the Patriot Act, or any of the other issues you mentioned. My mention of white privilege was specifically relevant to " John 's " dismissal of Ms. Shebshi 's experience because his white feelings were hurt. <p> The Wikipedia entry on white privilege is a good place to start learning about the concept. <h> pete.d <p> Sure. Of course we do. So, if and when there 's an actual threat in which there 's some clear evidence of wrong-doing, genuinely suspicious behavior that could lead to a plane getting blown up, by all means law enforcement should take that seriously. <p> But in this case? None of that was present. Some facts : <p> None of the behaviors of the people arrested was actually genuinely suspicious It is not even plausible that any of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane. None of the people arrested so far for attempting to do so even came close to having a working plan that would have led to that result The plane was not even in the air, nor preparing to be in the air. That ship had sailed, and every passenger on the plane was assured of their " right to not be blown up in the air ", no matter what law enforcement did to the suspects <p> So next time you invoke your rights, please take the time to be sure they are relevant to the context. <h> Allison <h> Chris <p> yea lets use wikipedia for a backup because its soo reliable right? and you racial idiots who say that white people have priviliges and as soon as you get approached about it you say that you were being " misunderstood ". i do nt care if your black white orange green or freakin pink. jump off this subject about profiling and feeling so " violated ". its gettin real old! <h> Marnie <p> Chris, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say, " you racial idiots who say that white people have privileges... " <p> Anyone who can not identify with a strong feeling of violation by hearing that someone was wrongly accused, strip searched, and interrogated has lost not only any sense of what it means to be American( if they ever had that,) but is a cold and hardened human being( if they still are considered ' human '.) <p> Why do n't we take your mom and dad, handcuff them, throw them in a dirty cell with no explanation, ability to use the restroom, or allowance to call you and explain why they never showed up at home after their plane landed, strip them, cavity search them, interrogate them, and then send them on their merry way after 4 hours -- and then tell me there was no violation. <p> And, if you can not acknowledge that there is still an advantage to being white in our society -- especially in this era -- then, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not you 're actually aware of your ignorance. <p> Furthermore, if you 're so sure that Wikipedia is completely unreliable, then why do n't you provide references to your own credible resources, versus just shutting down hers? <p> For such a moving, disturbing, and beautifully raw post, written by an honest, feeling person about their own tragic experience, the discussion seems to be rife with unfeeling, defensive, ignorant, and imperious commentary. <p> This is about a person, and all of our rights as Americans, to be free from subjection to violation -- regardless of the situation, and especially without due process. It was never about protecting a plane full of innocent people ; they were never in danger.( Besides being protected when everyone was screened before boarding, this happened after there was no more question of their possible potential impending danger.) <p> Whether you agree with the comparison to the climate in pre-WWII Germany, this quote by Martin Niemller certainly rings true they came for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I was n't a they came for Jews, and I did n't I was Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me. " <p> If there are n't protections for all Americans against this kind of abuse of power( from wherever it stems, or is allowed,) then soon none of us will be protected from frivolous encroachments on our rights -- for any reason, or none at all. The only entity which can protect our rights is us -- united together. <p> If you ca n't see this much, then you have no morally or intellectually valid leg to stand on in this discussion. <h> What To Do? <p> Allison -- I 'm going to chime ine on the white/black piece. Would you let me know the ratio of black to white pro football players and pro basketball players. Please do n't say white 's have extra privileges... if anything, the pendulum has swung back the other way. Agree with you Piper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books, Allison. Good for you. However, this is not an issue of " white privilege " by any definition. White German-Americans were treated much worse than this during WWI and WWII. That 's because we were at war with them. Now, we are at war with Islamic extremists who come primarily from the Middle East. If tall, blonde Swedish people were attacking us, they would be profiled, beaten, and treated unfairly just as the German-Americans were. I 'm not saying it 's right. I 'm saying that 's the bottom line. <h> bridgett <p> Bridgett, I 'm referring to the 9/11 bombers, who were all from the Middle East. There 's enough literature out there to educate you about Al-Qaeda that I should n't have to explain why we are hunting down Middle Eastern terrorists in Asia. Just google it. <h> I support Rationality <h> Sarah S <p> I see you do n't read a lot of history, Piper. During WWII we were at war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those two ethnic backgrounds got carted off to camps, had all their property stolen and after the war were denied for decades any legal redress of their wrongs?( Hint : it was n't the white-skinned ones.) Guess which of those two ethnic groups perpetrated actual acts of sabotage against the US government, the fear of which formed the justification for the internment?( Hint : it was n't the brown-skinned ones.) <p> By the way, I 'm white, grew up partly in the South and my ancestors were among the first settlers of Georgia. And it 's not the bottom line. The bottom line, if you 're American, is the truths we " hold to be self-evident ". Among those truths is NOT " run scared and trample on the Constitutional rights of anyone who looks different than you the minute you feel threatened. " <h> fonsmoonen <h> Gump <p> Whatever, I was a white kid who grew up in a mexican neighborhood. In my school, white people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that situation. So sick of hearing that. If you 're singled out as being a gang member because you dress like a gang member, who 's fault is that? <h> Allison <p> Silly me. When you said China has a perfect job for me, I assumed you invoked China rather than Obama for a reason. But I can understand how you 'd mistype " China " instead of " Obama " -- those keys are so close to each other on the keyboard! <p> If you were n't calling me a Communist, you would n't have mentioned China. <h> Alice <p> With all due respect, Allison, Obama could have changed those policies the moment he got into office if he wanted to. Instead, he has done everything he can to expand on those power-grabbing policies, i.e. the " enhanced patdowns " that he specifically advocates. Take a look at the progression of the federal regulations and the executive interpretations on the issues. This is not a case of " Democrat good, Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell up. the same old white people are bad and others are good. what you idiots do nt know is that you get on here and talk about how profiling is wrong and stereotyping is wrong but yet you say as much bad as you can and call white people rednecks and say that white people have priviliges. thats stereotyping right there wow how stupid can allison, yodamite, and X, and steve bock get? <h> Allison <p> Nothing in this comment thread, or in the concept of white privilege, states that whites are bad and others are good. We are talking about racial profiling that results in the violation of someone 's Constitutional rights. <p> Ms. Shepshi already admitted, in her original blog post, that her responses to the events were exactly what she was experiencing, and owned up to that. Again, I am amused that whites who read the post seem to focus ONLY on her gut-level reaction to being handcuffed, detained, strip and cavity searched, and interrogated, and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip and cavity searched, and interrofated. <h> Anna <p> Allison -- What happened on that plane is atroicious. But when you can prove to me that all white people enjoy those same rights then maybe I will believe in your theory. As of now, I ca n't because it does n't take into account that people have individual stories and histories. That is one racist theory and you being a white person who believes it does n't make it any less racist. <h> Allison <p> Please explain how the fact that white people, in general and as a group, have certain privileges( an assumption of normality, for example, or a decreased likelihood to be racially profiled, for another) is racist rather than descriptive. <h> Yodamite <p> White privilege has already been demonstrated here multiple times -- not just including the events Mrs. Hebshi recalled. In this comment section, people have repeatedly disregarded the greater injustice inflicted on Mrs. Hebshi in favor of the minor insult directed at the white officers. They see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardship Mrs. Hebshi faced. They have blamed Mrs. Hebshi herself for her arrest, and have attempted to defend racial profiling.( They have the advantage of promoting racial profiling, knowing full well that it will never impact themselves.) They see racial discussion as an imposition on their lives and they seek to shut it down. <p> White privilege is not just a set of advantages that white people possess, but it is also the delusion that racial inequality does not exist and that people of color are at fault for not achieving the advantages that they have. This delusion also allows them the initiative to control the discourse on racial relations. <p> How often do we hear people like Chris pop up on sites like these and, in monosyllabic fashion, attack anyone who dares discuss racism? His state of mind is the very definition of white privilege. <h> Yodamite <h> Rollie Fingers <h> Michelle <p> How about you not think about yourself for one moment out of your entire white-male life? You have no clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority, to have some white person point a finger at you for nothing more than being brown or different and get hauled off by cops. Your white privilege is showing. You will never be strip searched and humiliated in front of a 50+ people with no reasoning given, purely because you do n't look like an " Real American. " <p> Your " hurt feelings " are the last thing that this is supposed to be about. Shame on you! <h> Ahsan <p> Dear John- You 're right. Southern white men have never done anything evil. Love, former slaves, victims of Jim Crow laws, Native Americans, Latinos, women, Asians, and the rest of this increasingly " colored " country. " People " like you believe every lie that you suck from Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity 's teats. Yet you accuse this account for " blatant lies "? Based on what? Grow up and realize that the world is a much more nuanced and complex place than your provincial world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And on behalf of the rest of us Americans, we 're ALL offended by you and your brothers in redneckery. <h> Daisymae <p> I too am a white Southerner( very proud of it) and I am ASHAMED of YOU and your Hideous, hateful remarks. It 's people like you who cause the rest of the country to believe such awful stereotypes of Southerners. <p> I am appalled, shocked, and horrified at what happened to Shoshanna and these two gentlemen -- innocent people just minding their own business. This hideous abuse of innocent Americans by our out of control government has to STOP! <p> Real Americans -- real patriots -- will do everything in their power to oppose this abuse of our citizens. That includes morally upright Southerners. <h> Hitobito <p> John, You are not only white and a southerner, you are ignorant. You would n't be able to recognize a " blatant lie " if it landed on your pecker. She does n't have to " make the white man look bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it themselves. So, STFU. <h> George <p> John, just because you do n't believe it happened as described does n't mean it did n't happen exactly as she said it did, and if you take a derogatory comment as a reason to become all upset and offended, try for a second imagining you were in her place, and this happened to you. <p> Do n't you have a shred of compassion for a fellow person and an American citizen who was treated this way? What about her RIGHTS? <p> Can you imagine that you are in a place where there are mostly asian people, and you were taken off a plane, strip searched, and not told of what you were being held for. If you told your story of what happened, and made a comment on the way the person was making cracks about how they were going to make more overtime because you were being held, and how, for them, the tragedy of 9/11 was a great thing... more $$$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you being in that place. I am a white person, and have been in places where I was treated very different that someone who was from the area( mostly jamaican and spanish people in this case), and it was pretty easy to get angry that they were treating me like this in my own country, and it would be very easy to comment on the way they looked, or their funny accents, or hair, or... <p> Have people lost the ability to be compassionate to our fellow human beings, to see differences in ethnicity as a bad thing rather than an enriching thing to our communities, have we become the same as the people who caused and committed the attacks, and are we turning on each other now? <p> I believe that Osama Bin Ladin achieved what he wanted in the end : and bankrupt country, in both a financial and spiritual way. It 's comments like yours that confirm this hypothesis. <h> LB <h> zirjo <p> JOHN.. she decided at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and whatever comes along with it. In other words she hated the idea that white men was doing this to her. You know when someone refers as to rednecks that reminds me of ignorance. Not race and this is what she meant. by using this words. As in many societies there is lacks of education and and most of all competence on what you do in this case is security the people taken this kind of jobs and you see it in every port the woman about 70 years old with no bladder only a bag on her side to hold her pee... but she must be searched because this is security or otherwise( I could loose my job excuse) Personnel taking this position are not the smart security force, you can think of them as untrained and not too smart but they could beat you if you resist, they do not know anything about privacy acts whatsoever very ignorant people that do things as if it was only one color in front of their eyes. I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so stupid on their search you can stand there and see their mistakes and think how many people could go trough this isles and find dozens of ways someone could take illegal instruments into an airliner. Their job is completely unnecessary if there is another attack for sure will not be coming in an airliner any way. I appreciate authorities took a step towards security but this is done absolutely wrong. I hope that some day they can restore our liberties and stop scaring people throughout the whole USA. The so called( patriots) that call on these 3 are the 1st ignorant s.. the ones to follow are even more stupid.. till the bosses arrived FBI and others.... <h> Allison <h> Em <p> Yes, because in Detroit they make it a point to hire all officers of color seeing as it is a predominantly Black city... right. <p> The Detroit Metro airport is located in Romulus, MI. The officers in this account were not local police officers. They are employed by the goverment. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes the majority of the officers &; TSA agents are White. In fact, every airport I have flown to the officers are predominantly White. Whites are the majority in this country. How is it odd that she only dealt with one officer of color? <p> And if you are truly a compassionate White person so concerned with the civil rights struggles of other ethnic groups, why would you be offended by her reaction? How would you react if you had been racially profiled? I 'm sure you would have been completely logical &; not thought anything ill of any of the people who were mistreating you right? And then to bring the term " whitey " into this... I have to wonder where your motivation is when you are so " compassionate " and sympathetic to others causes? We should be sympathetic to one another when we are mistreated. Do you want a pat on the back for being a half decent person? <p> FYI, whites are NOT the majority in this country. Browns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority. I for one hope that the non-white population of this country treats the white population better than we have treated them throughout the history of our country. Right now we whites are n't doing such a great job with that. <p> Ben Franklin said it best : " Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. " With our current policies on " preventing terrorism ", we have given up basic liberties guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution as Allison pointed out. There is absolutely no evidence that treating our own citizens, whatever they look like, as if they ARE terrorists has PREVENTED even one single act of actual terrorism. <p> The kind of profiling that needs to be done does not depend on the color of a person 's skin or even whether they have a " foreign " accent. It depends on behavioral characteristics, as practiced for years by Israeli airport security. This should have been put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely annoying, and mostly worthless things that have been done over the last 10 years. <h> jamie <p> Whites are no longer the majority of this country. I am lily white, country music listener, and cold beer in a coozie drinker yet I am not considered a red neck. I have been profiled not because of race but because of hair color. I am a blonde and a very smart blonde at that. I am an accounting major with a 4.0 gpa but people do n't know that all they see is a blonde ditz. Profiling happens with everyone white, black, asian, middle eastern no matter what our race is. With that being said it went to far in this poor womans story it should have gone down a different way as another poster said earlier whomever called this in should have been questioned further before anyone acted on this and also I would like to know if this was all acted upon by one " nervous " individual. <h> zirjo <p> Jamie I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she would hate anything to do with Country music, and whatever comes along with it. In other words she hated the idea that white men was doing this to her. You know when someone refers as to rednecks that reminds me of ignorance. Not race and this is what she meant. by using this words. As in many societies there is lacks of education and and most of all competence on what you do in this case is security the people taken this kind of jobs and you see it in every port the woman about 70 years old with no bladder only a bag on her side to hold her pee... but she must be searched because this is security or otherwise( I could loose my job excuse) Personnel taking this position are not the smart security force, you can think of them as untrained and not too smart but they could beat you if you resist, they do not know anything about privacy acts whatsoever very ignorant people that do things as if it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you sometimes i had travel i noticed this people are so stupid on their search you can stand there and see their mistakes and think how many people could go trough this isles and find dozens of ways someone could take illegal instruments into an airliner. Their job is completely unnecessary if there is another attack for sure will not be coming in an airliner any way. I appreciate authorities took a step towards security but this is done absolutely wrong. I hope that some day they can restore our liberties and stop scaring people throughout the whole USA. The so called( patriots) that call on these 3 are the 1st ignorant s.. the ones to follow are even more stupid.. till the bosses arrived FBI and others.... <h> Sarah S <p> Oh? You were pulled off a plane in handcuffs without explanation, had all your orifices examined by a stranger and were held while your husband and children waited anxiously with no word of what had happened to you for hours because you were BLONDE?? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DO realize that what happened to this woman was wrong- but please be careful of what premises you accept. Racial profiling does NOT mean people saying insensitive or hurtful things to you based on your personal appearance. It means having your civil rights violated based on your apparent ancestry. <h> Christian Zimbabwan <p> Omg your name is schultz! you must be a white neonazi! oh wait my name is Christian zimbabwan! you probably think I 'm a dirty gorilla with the brain of a pea worshipping old books! <p>( this was just an example, I 'm not even black) See, it 's hopeless, sickening, and it just makes me sick to be called an american nowadays. What ever happened to the land of the free so many brave men and women DIED for? what ever happened to the CHRISTIAN country that accepted all believes with harmony? We tolerate atheist and they urinate on the cross, wow. What ever happened to tolerance and respect? Most saddening, those you got the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Interesting is n't it. Well I 'm sure the type of people I 'm talking about might reply to me insulting me. Pretty easy to find them. <p> As for me, I 'm not paying overpriced ripoff air tickets to get searched like a delinquent so the other with no morals who loves to be touched by the TSA can feel " safe ". Even with all that bunch of crap security and bigotry you got a nigerian to blow up his pants. So it does n't seem effective besides constant terror on the population. Heck like many have said here, these terrorist have surely done a great job at bringing TERROR to YOU. I 'm more scared of my own people than someone blowing up the plane. Maybe if i comb my hair to the right they 'll think I 'm trying to cover explosive in my cranium. <h> Stacia <p> Not only that, but the one officer of color was a " fat Jada Pinkett Smith. " That 's a little too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to be comfortable with it. Some reactionary talk because of the situation seems perfectly legit, and I 'd qualify " fat bellies and rednecks " as such an expression, but Shoshana continues with multiple negative comments about weight and skin color and culture -- including the " fat Jada Pinkett Smith " comment -- and it makes me cringe. It just does. <p> Some people apparently think she deserved being singled out because she has proven after the fact to be as concerned about skin color as the panicky idiot on the plane who reported her because of her appearance. That 's a lot of crap. We live in a culture that routinely gives credence to citizens who profile based on race. In that way, even though Homeland Security did n't see these 3 people and detain them based on their appearance, they immediately believed a citizen who DID judge them based on appearance alone. <p> Homeland Security and law enforcement are racist because they are enabling a system that allows racism to go unchecked because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes as much as people of color do. Enablers of racism, enablers of fear. <p> Although it would be nice to have read this post without dealing with the author 's obvious **40;5882;TOOLONG... attitude. <h> Marnie <p> If she thought all black people looked alike, then how would she know what Jada Pinkett Smith looks like? <p> It 's getting more and more obvious that a large number of people here are reacting from their gut about past, building issues they are holding onto, and not using their heads, nor a clear, nonjudgemental perspective from which to address this travesty... much less a sense of fairness, compassion, or even a less-than self-centered viewpoint... <h> M <p> OR... maybe that woman really did look like a fat Jada Pinkett-Smith. When I read Shoshana 's account, a number of things came to mind -- this is an intelligent woman who writes well, has a good sense of humor, is very observant and has interesting insights, is outspoken, is astute, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights, but very few people are( and besides, the US Patriot Act leaves us with very little in circumstances like this). Anyway, I had no doubt that when she wrote that someone looked like a fat Jada Pinkett-Smith, the woman must have actually looked like that! I do n't think it 's the **27;5924;TOOLONG trope at all but an astute observation with a pop culture reference. <h> Yoko <p> Maybe she did throw them into a stereotypical category based on what they looked like, but did she call " the authorities " on them and cause them to be subjected to the humiliation she went through? No. So, it 's probably not fair to call her a hypocrite. Also, I 'll bet she was in the worst mood of her life so I 'll say a little name calling is okay in this situation. <h> Lance <h> Iqbal <p> You have no idea of what racial profiling is all about Schultz. You only ' think ' you do which is not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative type can be mentally devastating and can leave deep psychological scars. As I come from a loving family background and I am emotionally secure, it does n't affect me at all. However, a lot of people are not so lucky and I fear for their mental well being. Schulz needs to swallow a big dose of humility. If you really want to understand the damaging effects of racial profiling, why do n't you go to Afghanistan and be an American ' guest ' of the Taliban!! <h> sstan <p> Considering everything that is being discussed, I do n't believe it is fair to assume Charles is white. Do you think he is white because his name is Charles? The way he writes? Have you seen this man before? Met him? You are certainly quick to assume -- which is exactly what the people on the airplane were doing -- assuming something suspicious was going on. <h> Allison <p> With all due respect, Mr. Heller, I think that such a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone without a certain amount of privilege. <p> People with privilege, either racial or class/economic, can refuse to cooperate and have that refusal be seen as exercising their rights. Unfortunately, most of the time when people of color or or lower SES exercise their right to not cooperate, it 's most often seen as " resisting arrest " or refusal to cooperate for nefarious reasons. <p> I believe that such a reaction on the part of people without power would only exacerbate the situation. <p> Allison, thanks for writing that response to Mr. Heller. His advice is dangerous and misguided. It would have definitiely made the situation worse and Shoshana would have probably ended up with a charge, at minimum, in response to that type of behavior. <h> nickmalik <p> @Allison is correct. If she has refused to cooperate, she 's still be in prison. <p> I am of Indian and American descent and an American citizen. Ironically, my family history in the USA goes back to Bunker Hill, yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was stopped regularly at airports and questioned because my first name is common in the middle east, even though I 've never used it. They 've cleaned up " the list " in the last few years, so I do n't get stopped anymore, but it is always on my mind. <p> Your experience is frightening because it is systematic. There is nothing that would " prevent " it from happening again, or even challenge the behavior of the government and airlines. <p> Racism has a part here. All it takes is one ignorant person, or one racist, in a position of even " relatively little authority, " and the system runs off the rails. There are no rules to prevent it. <p> And that is what worries me for our future. We have no right to redress these concerns. <h> Ginny <p> Honestly, I think refusing to cooperate would be bad for ANY person, regardless of age, race, sex, economic standing, etc. Really, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what Shoshana did. It 's horrible that she was put in that situation, but because she cooperated she now has a power of her own. She wrote this blog as a normal person, not as a radical who courageously( and perhaps unwisely) stood up to the " MAN ", but as a normal person who got stuck in a horrible situation. It 's when things start happening to normal people that we begin to evaluate what went wrong. Hopefully everyone who reads this will be able to reflect on what Shoshana has so bravely shared with us. Anybody could be " that person " on the plane ; both the person who was unjustly profiled and the person who overreacted by alerting security to an imaginary threat. Maybe by reading this, a future mistake can be avoided. <p> I think you are correct, I can not honestly and truly imagine myself in this situation, but I am pretty sure I would be scared out of my wits and would do whatever I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to strip, yup fine! Want me to talk? Ok, done! You want a BLT, give me the ingredients... I wont even spit in it. I think when you are in that situation you just need to do whatever you deem is best for you -- to get you out of the situation. I would like to think that I would have gone in that interview room and in response to their questions repeatedly asked to be read my rights and informed why I was there, but honestly... I would probably have been serving BLT 's!!! <h> Jeffrey Renz <p> Actually, it 's a tightrope when you are being interviewed by a federal officer or agent. Shoshana was lucky to have encountered ethical agents. 18 USC 1001 makes it a felony to utter a false statement. The second you open your mouth in an interview like Shoshana 's you risk being charged with this offense. If you remember Martha Stewart or Barry Bonds or Scooter Libby, you 'll remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were investigated. They were convicted of uttering a false statement. 18 USC 1001 is the last refuge of a failed investigation. Shoshanna Hebshi was lucky. <h> Gump <h> Jane Wong <p> I agree with Allison. Shoshana did exactly what she should and could -- put all this information on the Internet and let it get as wide a distribution as possible. It is much harder to keep this kind of egregious behavior hushed up now than it was several years ago, and the public has a right to know. <h> Guest <p> If only that was the way the real world actually worked. I think you would be amazed how many Americans were imprisioned and denied representation after 9/11 because of it was under the the threat of terrorism. Also, I am surprised that you are " appalled " by Shoshana 's response yet you are not appalled with a person who reports suspicious activity to the authorities because of racial profiling. <h> Abhi <p> @Alison : Not wanting to " have difficulties " is exactly how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a hue and cry about your rights being violated, it makes it an issue and forces them to change the way they do things. But if you were say a black person, and did not object to sitting at the back of the bus, that is exactly how they end up telling you to attend separate schools and make laws punishing you for sitting in front of the bus. But apparently rights and freedoms are something that do not matter much for you. <h> Allison <h> Ian <p> And if you DO sit in the front of the bus, and do n't give in to The Man, then you 're free -- and they drag you out in the middle of the night, set dogs on you, beat you half to death, then hang you the rest of the way to death, and then burn your body. <p> It 's not as effective a way to protest as you might think, unless you 've got a whole community backing you. <h> Allison <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights the way Rosa Parks did! " crowd does n't understand is that Ms. Parks ' indeed very brave action was n't exactly spontaneous. She along with the NAACP and the SCLC had planned for months to engage in this civil disobedience, so she 1) had a plan, 2) was prepared for the opportunity, and 3)( and most importantly) had a network of confederates and legal people in place for when the event took place. <p> Ms. Shebshi, on the other hand, had none of those, so it 's a bit disingenuous to claim that she should have, in the heat of the moment, with no forethought or planning and no network of legal professionals, " stand up to the man. " <h> Ian <p> Yep, and that they chose Rosa Parks very carefully, and chose NOT to go with three or four OTHER volunteers, all equally brave, because they thought that there was possibilities of backlash, and of dragging names through the mud in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wedlock, for instance). <p> That Rosa Parks was an activist, brave, intelligent, prepared, and with a team. We Americans like the idea of a lone brave person standing up to injustice, but one person ca n't stand up to an organized, systemic problem. It requires a whole team. This takes nothing away from Parks ; she is every bit the hero that people think she is -- just, she was backed with a huge team of OTHER heroes, as well. <h> Rich <h> More Scared of the Government <p> Allison put that quite nicely, but I would add that your response harkens back to an era where you could n't be cavity searched simply for being in row 12 and having darker skin than the people in row 11. <p> She was n't practicing some form of civil disobedience -- she was sitting on an airplane waiting to get home to her husband &; children. <p> Due process went out the window in the past 10 years. No one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sorry, but your lawyer is here and since we have no credible proof against you, we 're going to have to let you go. " If she had n't been tweeting? There 's no reason to believe that her family would 've been able to figure out where she was if she had continued to be detained " in the interest of national security. " <p> There IS precedent that they can detain you without cause, which makes this a very tricky proposition. I agree that we must resist the abuse of authority, especially since this is clearly evidence that our country has now reached a fascist existence and anything can happen to any of us. Even this very statement of opinion is doubtless being recorded, analyzed, and reported somewhere in our country 's intelligence apparatus. But in this situation I feel safe enough, for the moment at least, to make the statement against our authorities ' behavior. So please, Mr. Heller, do not be appalled, but offer constructive criticism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now know to not converse. But I suspect weighing one 's options during the experience is the only thing that has kept many an innocent individual safer in all the countries and regimes who have experienced the era we are just beginning to enter. Having heard my parents talk of disappeared acquaintances during the military regime in 60? s and 70? s Brasil, I never dreamed I would could be facing this disgusting and repulsive situation after my parents brought us here for a better opportunity. This is truly disgusting and we must fight at any chance we get, but perhaps not once each of our very breaths are directed by detainment... and I DO wonder who ALL these terrorists are. Are n't we all just pawns in someone 's game? How many individuals are there who feel they can manipulate not only you and me, but masses of us. They must be brought low. Cooperation can make us much greater than the fear and survivalist paradigms. PEACE. <p> Um, no, there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This woman 's constitutional rights were shredded. <p> Everyone 's thoughts about race here are missing the point : this can happen to any of us. As a " white man " who has been unlawfully detained by DHS( see my blog), I am keenly aware that even if they FIRST come for those with darker skin, you can rest assured that if we ALL do not resist NOW that they will eventually come for us all. <p> Charles Haller, It is easier said than being done. I can not imagine what would have happened to Shoshana if she had refused to answer their question. This country is not what it used to be. Do n't forget " the great patriot act " which allow the government agencies to apprehend without release. <p> Oh, come on. You 're appalled at her actions? While you have a point with regards to exercising personal rights, your harsh and disrespectful tone to her in that single sentence is unnecessary ; besides, I think the unfortunate reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines of Allison 's comment. <h> Daniel <p> On the other hand however, by complying with the law, she 's been able to leave much quicker. I do not believe that it is in anyway the officers fault, they have just been doing there job ; yes things like strip searches are humiliating, but you have to look at it from their point of view too. They did n't know if she was an actual terrorist or not, so they are obviously going to take every precaution necessary to make sure they are safe. Fortunately she was innocent, but who is to say, that of those other 50 cases across the country, that someone else was n't? You just do n't know that, and while it 's unfair that she has been detained, someone on that plane has reported her, and the authorities have acted on that report. Compliance would only help her too, as refusal to talk is often suspicious, and if she has nothing to hide, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason not to talk. <h> ayesha <p> i do n't know... i do n't buy that they have the right to arrest, detain and strip search an individual just because someone says they think that person might be a terrorist... this is the problem with profiling. someone could easily report me just because i look muslim and foreign( it has happened to me, but thankfully i was n't detained or anything, and the cops were very nice). and i should be understanding of being strip searched because they have to make sure i 'm not a terrorist??? shoshana 's story makes my blood boil, i 'm sorry... i have no problem complying with extra security measures, i 've been docile as a dove with my TSA encounters and i 'll even understand a little extra attention based on mine and my hubby 's " muslim " appearance, whatever. but something like this? hellz to the no. just my opinion. <h> Exillior <p> You need to review the States ' Terrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the Patriot Act in the States. In the UK, from the moment you 've been suspected of being a terrorist, it is possible for the law to detain you for 28 days( that was supposed to expire on Jan 2011 but I do n't think it has) without ANY charge being made against you, and your assets are automatically no longer yours. <p> Well said. Here is one thing I do n't understand about all of the TSA, if everyone, and as sad as I am to say it more so Muslims or those looking like them, are so thoroughly searched before even getting to the gates why would they even think that someone could have bombs strapped to them as this poor woman was asked about. <p> " They did n't know if she was an actual terrorist or not, so they are obviously going to take every precaution necessary to make sure they are safe. " <p> That does n't follow. It 's true of most of the people you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOW whether they 're actual terrorists, but that does n't entitle anyone to " take every precaution " for safety. <p> " Compliance would only help her too, as refusal to talk is often suspicious, and if she has nothing to hide, which she obviously did n't, then she would n't have any reason not to talk. " <p> So you would n't mind if we allowed the police to randomly search any home in the US without a warrant. This should n't be a problem for you, unless you 've got something to hide, right? <p> This is because we have abdicated personal responsibility to the system ; we do n't trust individual officers to evaluate the situation( any non-racist person could easily look at the three people detained and determine that they were not a threat), because so many are corrupt, so we process everyone through a " process " equally demeaning to all who pass through it. <h> Liz <p> Did you know that Communist regimes and Hitler used that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear " BS? There is. no. excuse. for what the authorities did. None. None. That you are trying to justify their actions because they make us " safer " is apalling, disgusting, and obscene. Tell you what, YOU go get thrown into prison, get strip-searched, and be prohibited from making any phone calls to your family or a lawyer, without cause. Then come back and tell me it was just fine, just a minor inconvenience in the name of safety. <h> Jen <p> Your response begs the question... does n't the FBI have a compiled list of known terrorist? If not why would n't they work on finding out who they are and target them instead of our great citizenship. I know for a fact that the airports have a compiled list of " suspicious names " they check.( I have traveled with friends who are stopped every time they travel) They know that much. What about all the " security measures " taken at the gate? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates are pointless and faulty? Should n't we be concerned with that instead of harassing our citizens? What have we really gained with all these " security measures " anyway? A false sense of security that means nothing anyway because if you " look " suspicious you can be pointed out even to the point of being aboard a plane and landed, safely mind you, detained for an unknown amount of time without any contact, without any knowledge( a.k.a your civil rights denied). Meanwhile the real terrorist can probably get through the checks and gates without being detected. Maybe what we are saying is that we have come full circle to McCarthy era like fear where we point out our neighbors as terrorist in place of communist. At the very least we should look at a process where we are unfairly detain OUR people and not detain FOREIGN travelers. I do n't believe I have read of an instance where Homeland security detained FOREIGN travelers for suspicious activity on an airplane or otherwise. And do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel here to the U.S. with the knowledge that we have cracked-down on our incoming foreign visitors and therefore they would not spend their MONEY here. It 's easier to appear to be doing something when we use our own people as scapegoats then to target the real problem. <h> Rob <p> Mr. Heller is correct that you would be within your rights not to cooperate. Let 's play that out though : Would they still detain you? Yes, they only need " a reasonable suspicion, " in this case based on the citizen report. Would they still search you? Yes. They can do that in order to protect themselves from potential weapons. Would they still question you? Yes. You might have a lawyer there( and a wait for the lawyer to arrive from origin unknown given that you 're in a city away from home -- how many criminal defense attorneys do you know outside, or even inside, your own city?) and the lawyer might advise you not to answer certain questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 're likely to be released, but all you 've done is wasted your own time and money delaying the inevitable. Not very good advice Mr. Heller. <h> John Q. Public <p> Well, Rob, for some people dignity and self-respect are worth more than money and time. Without those people we become a society of sheep, bending over naked while some TSA flunky shines a flashlight up our buttholes. I never cease to be amused at the number of Americans who crow about how free they are yet do n't see a problem with TSA activities. It 's nothing short of Gestapo/KGB behavior. <h> Daniela <p> I think her response was mature and right. While the authorities may not have treated her with fairness and respect, she was the BETTER person and proved her intelligence, bravery, and understanding the best anyone could in that situation. If I ever found myself in that situation I would hope that I would act the same, although I do n't know that I would have the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone whose top priority is to talk to her husband and let him know she is O.K. it would be more beneficial for her to comply with the authorities. She was able to call her husband and was eventually released because she complied with them. If she had been detained any longer, her husband would now know the situation and be able to get a lawyer involved to have her released. If she had disobeyed their orders she would have been held even longer and personally, to be stressing over whether your loved ones think you are alive or dead is much worse than answering a few questions for the FBI. <h> Steve Bock <p> This woman was falsely imprisoned, hand-cuffed, stuck in a small cell, deprived of a bathroom, and finally strip -searched( including her body cavities). And you have the gall to suggest that she should have refused to cooperate? That her behavior appalled you? If she 'd been uncooperative, they would have kept her locked up for days, and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You talk like a big guy. Let 's see how tough you are after a cop has you in cuffs, against the wall, with his gloved finger probing your anus. <h> laars <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Something to consider. Was she read her Miranda rights and was she arrested? If not, she should have been let go immediately and if so, she had the rights to an attorney immediately. But, in the case of suspected terrorism, does n't Jurisprudence go out the door and then they can detain her indefinitely without the right to a fair and speedy trial? Also if martial law is declared, there is no more Jurisprudence. People can be arrested without being told why and then be held for indefinite lengths of time. <p> Someone needs to report to Americans( or anyone in the US) what they should do in an instance like this. <p> I so agree with you Erin. Even though I am living in Sweden this made my heart and eyes pour out sadness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful thing that happened in the event described. Your story scares me because of the similarities to what the Nazi did during world war two when they singled out people solely based on their Jewish or Romano descent. That also happened because of fear and ignorance. I send you perfect love straight from my heart and soul and I feel you are a true hero for not loosing your temper and remaining calm towards your aggressors. <h> Concerned <h> Allison <p> My responses to the comments here have been calm and reasoned. I do n't believe I have called anyone names. I have asked for evidence for people 's statements, and have disagreed with people. Disagreement is not hate. Asking for evidence is not starting problems. <h> Allison <h> BayAreaBiker <p> I have exactly similar sentiments as Yoko. This whole unfortuante event with Ms Hebshi and how she carried herself through the ordeal and the support she received in the form of comments from folks like Allison is admirable, and a leanring experience in its own. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well. I am completely sure that if I were in Ms. Shebshi 's situation, I would not have responded with such grace and calmness. Her strength of character is admirable. <h> Marnie <h> Karen <p> Shirley Pakulslo- Are you for real? I can completely believe this story. Though I have never had to endure this kind of treatment, after 9/11 every time I f'lew I was ' randomly selected ' to be searched. Turns out my maiden name was the same as someone on the terrorist watch list. I am a blue eyed light haired, American citizen. I once flew with a Jewish friend of mine who had olive skin and a dark bushy beard. We were both pulled out for search. My friend said " I get why I am being pulled out but ca n't figure out why you are! " It happens everyday, people are so afraid. This woman has endured enough, no need for you to call her a liar. As it happens since I have been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of line. <h> laars <p> karen so you got pulled out of line big deal so have i. im just a white guy minding my own business and i got nothing to hide i say check away. as far as it was because the color of her skin maybe look at all the terrorist pic, hmmmmm. sorry if you were late for dinner honey. <h> Sam <p> Please do explain how something picked up by news agencies is bullshit. Do n't say you 're sorry because you are not. You may not want to believe it, but it happens all the time. It 's too bad if your illusions about freedom and liberty for all took a hit, but any student of history could have told you that such an America never existed. Sice 9/11/01 it 's certainly entered the realm of the implausible. <h> Marnie <p> Let 's be clear : There is no reason to call this story bullshit. Why did you even read it, or bother to post that if you really believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be VERY careful of claiming, or even believing, that because something is reported in the big business of the News Agencies, that it is fact... They are just as penetrable by corruption and lies as the government!( Money speaks loudly to every one!) <h> Sophie <p> If anyone was ever confused as to what the word ' privilege ' means, here it is in a nutshell : believing that because you personally have never encountered harassment, then the harassment can not be real, and the people who are reporting it must have something wrong with them. <h> borkula <p> Hey Shirley, wake up. This kind of stuff happens all the time. If you do n't believe me, here 's an experiment you can do. Wear a veil or turban for a week and see how people treat you. it 's a pretty enlightening social experience. <p> Or dye your hair some fluorescent color. <p> Or if that 's too threatening for you, just borrow a rusty/primered car and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how much more frequently you get pulled over/ticketed vs your cozy SUV. <p> Try dressing to give the appearance that you are homeless and sitting in a park for an afternoon. See how long it takes the police to swing by. Do n't worry, it wo n't take long. <p> If her story seems strange to you, it 's probably because you 've always stayed where ' people like you belong '. Step outside your sheltered little world and you 'll find that it 's a very different place. <h> Andrew <h> Liz <p> " Lousy experience. " Well, are n't you the master of the understatement. So, if you 're ever imprisoned without cause and strip-searched, and not told what the whole ordeal was about until it was over, you 'll be fine and wo n't be angry or upset because, hell, it was just a lousy experience. Y'know, like being cut off on the interstate. <h> Yoko <p> Maybe she did throw them into a stereotypical category based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the authorities " on them and cause them to be subjected to the humiliation she went through? No. So, it 's probably not fair to call her a hypocrite. Also, I 'll bet she was in the worst mood of her life so I 'll say a little name calling is okay in this situation. I 've never heard of a better excuse. And I think her experience was a little more than lousy. <h> Katiebug <p> This argument is a paradox to this entire conversation. One stereotyping instance is acceptable when another is not? Just because the degree differs, does not mean the basis does. Hate is hate, to be quite honest. <p> Food for thought : What if the person who reported that row for suspicious activity had been in the " worst mood of his/her life "? Perhaps it was only name calling and it was okay in that person 's situation, too. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> I see exactly why she reported on descriptions of people. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fair to her story, she had to describe the people interrogating her to show if any looked like her or how they appeared. That was quite obvious as to her intentions with these descriptions. I am surprised that it flew over a few peoples ' heads. <h> dalancroft <h> StartProfilingNow <p> How is this so horrible? Were you arrested? No. Were you paraded in front of the media and your picture all over the TV? No. You got detained and asked questions for a few hours and it was a little scary. But you were n't beat up. You were n't charged with a crime you did n't commit. It is what it is. It was the 10th anniversary of 9/11! It was a day when the media reported they wanted to attack as if we needed to be told. It 's a plane ride, your normal freedoms do n't apply. Do n't give me and the rest of us this shit that you were profiled due to race. B.S. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something odd. I ca n't recall the last time I saw 2 men in the same row both get up and hang out at the bathroom for a long period of time. I could give a f*uck what race or creed or age they are ; if people do something suspicious it is what it is. Did you know they are pulling the oxygen masks out of the plan bathrooms because someone could go in there and blow the oxygen connection up easily? It takes time to fix all the planes. I hope and pray we start profiling in this country. No, not radical profiling that would be moronic and pointless. Profiling is where you watch the body language and other behaviors of a person and experts can pick out people who are more likely up to something bad. So you had a scary day but surprise surprise you went home quickly because you were innocent. But it had to be checked out. What if your seat mates really were bad guys? What do you expect us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have civil rights. Have the innocent hikers come home yet from Iran? No. So, I do n't blame you for being shook up and upset, but stop playing the race card as that 's f*ucking ridiculous. You yourself admitted you never had any problems before. Gee, I wonder why... <p> Thank you so much for sharing your story. I hate that this happened to you but I 'm so glad you wrote about it. I teach Social Studies to 7th and 8th graders. I read your narrative to them today as a follow up to something we were discussing in class -- how we have changed as a society since 9/11. I have never had a class of students sit so quietly and so attentively. It was a great starting off point for a lively discussion on the impact of increased security on the rights and liberties of citizens. Thank you for your story. I wish it had never happened. <h> Sybrsean <p> 1 : the quality or state of being free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b : freedom from physical restraint c : freedom from arbitrary or despotic control d : the positive enjoyment of various social, political, or economic rights and privileges e : the power of choice <p> Our country 's founders liberty, not democracy. Ron Paul <p> We hold these truths to be : that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Thomas Jefferson <p> Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Abraham Lincoln <p> Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. John F. Kennedy <p> Liberty can not be preserved without general knowledge among the people. John Adams <p> Liberty has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects of it. The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it. Woodrow Wilson <p> Give me liberty or give me death. Patrick Henry <p> I will gladly take the risk of death for " Liberty ", over the prospect of no Liberties for " Security ". Vote Ron Paul 2012 and restore Liberty to this country. What happened to you is an atrocity, it 's NOT AMERICAN. <h> Calin Brabandt <p> Shoshana, you should rethink your decision to fly entirely! This could 've happened on any day( other versions of your story certainly do happen every day). People must refuse to fly the airlines for any purpose, period( pleasure, business, family matters, etc.)! There is too much money in the " security " business and the sociopaths and tyrants running it are all power-drunk control freaks. Political processes will never end it. Vote with your wallet. Do n't buy the ticket. Do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist bureaus everywhere why you are not flying. When you and 10% or more of the population joins me, the senseless tyranny will end! <h> UNITED STATES VET. <p> GET OVER IT.... What about all those who died 10 years ago? Think about things from others point of view? The odds of 3 people all from the same ethnic background all sitting together in the same row. The two males acting out of the normal range, and this all taking place on 9/11. Obviously something was done to alert the crew to take said action. I fly every week, and see all kinds of behavior, so something must of caused the crew to react in the way they did. In my opinion, you just wanted to get exposure, and attention. Im sick to death of babies crying racial profiling, and discrimination. We are not living in candy land, with puppy dogs, and warm hugs. We have lost so many good people, so many soldiers. If officails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thier finger up your ass to keep it safe, so be it. Why do nt you ask the family and friends of all who died on 9/11 if they would of minded if those resonsible had been harrased just a little bit. <h> ruth <p> With all due respect to your service and those who died on 9/11, sir or ma'am, no. No, I will not relinquish my rights or those of others because someone with poor judgment may have overreacted. Our Constitution does not support violating someone with probing of their orifices, including their vagina and/or butthole, based on unfounded suspicions. The three people were not of the same ethnic background -- two were, one was not. We 've lost so many people over so many years and decades to maintain the integrity of our Constitution and our rights, including my father and many of his colleagues. As for 9/11, intelligence agencies and the presidents had information months before it occurred, yet they chose to ignore the warnings. <h> orangecountyresident <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you were among the Navy Seals that blew away Osama bin Laden. It 's racist pig Americans like you that cause me to lose respect for your country and your people. Since you expressed yourself about the OP having a finger stuck in her in such a flippant way, you have the potential to be a rapist bent on committing anal rape on women and men alike. I do n't feel safe living in the same country with people like you. You are more of a threat to this country than those 19 hijackers that struck on 9/11. <p> You are more of a threat to this country than those 19 hijackers that struck on 9/11. <p> While I agree completely with this statement, I 'll suggest that it would be heard by more people were it not surrounded by your obvious anger. I 'm angry as well I 'm angry about the dehumanization of the American people and countless other people over the course of history. But acting in anger and expressing anger are not effective remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people like " United States Vet "( I 'm a veteran myself) are not at all representative of the overwhelming majority of Americans, and are no more than fringe groups that the government and media are attempting to stir up to revolutionary violence. Let us hope that they are no more influential on the ground than they are in this conversation. <h> orangecountyresident <p> I am angry. I 'm angry that people like UNITED STATES VET who serve this country have racist and sexist attitudes and these bastards think they know what patriotism is when in fact they do n't know shit about patriotism. People who wear their patriotism on their sleeve like that are jingoistic jack-booted Nazis. The only people in uniform I respect as those who do n't suffer from Islamaphobia or who do n't go around judging people or make excuses for bad behavior as UNITED STATES VET has. Too often, people in uniform are very disrespectful towards those who are not in uniform or who do n't think like them. I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be an asshole about it as UNITED STATES VET has, then do n't expect me to respect you. <p> Quite often when someone directs anger at another person, people who witness it who are not angry about the same thing tend to try to find excuses for that other person, in order to avoid becoming angry. Seldom does one person 's anger change the mind of anyone else who is already angry about the same thing in any other way. It does not gain support, and tends to soften support that it already has. And as far as having any effect on the person at whom one is angry, expressions of anger most often met with denial, resistance, and hardening of whatever attitude or opinion inspires the anger in the first place. <p> Our anger, however, has power and like any other power, it gains strength and increases as long as it is not used. Undeserved anger returns its power on the person who is angry it 's a double-edged sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one 's own interest, not " against " others except where there is no choice at all. <p> And in all cases, it 's best to control your anger rather than let it control you. <h> Derrick S. <p> The next step is obvious, just ask any Japanese American who lived during WW2., especially if there another attack. <p> It 's a damn shame this country talks about standing tall and not balking at the face of terrorism yet that 's exactly what it 's done and in the process innocent people like you suffer from minds that have given in to fear. <p> I was not offended by her description in the least. Being a middle-aged white man who is slightly overweight and sometimes sports a flat top haircut, I think can explain the difference. Her statements were her own opinion. I happen to hate rednecks, beer bellies, country music, and speedboats, but that does n't make me prejudice about them. -- it 's only my opinion. Shoshana was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw, what she experienced, and what she felt -- intimidated. While she was being treated like a criminal before any proof had been presented. If her description offended you, then you are rather thin-skinned and missed the whole point of her blog entry. <p> You say you " hate " a specific kind of music and a specific kind of person... " I decided that I hated country music. I hated speedboats and shitty beer in coozies and fat bellies and rednecks. " Then you are just as guilty as those you claim profiled You. Shame on you. Maybe you would feel more comfortable in another part of the world, with " like-minded " people. USA would be happily left to hard working people, who listen to country music and drink crappy beer! Goodday, MIss. Go spread your hatred of America and its citizens somewhere else. <h> Allison <p> Her hatred of country music, speedboats, and shitty beer did n't result in someone spending hours in a dirty holding cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogated. <p> By the way, in the USA, people can hate stuff that you like. But usually it does n't result in Constitutional rights violations, the way it did in this case because someone " hated "( or at least distrusted) Ms. Shebshi 's skin color. <h> Alice <h> Liz <p> Cathy, you are the epitome of what is wrong with this country. She is a CITIZEN, you moron. She was subjected to abject degradation by people who fit all those things she does n't like. So, hating country music deserves imprisonment and strip searches? You are an imbecile, and you and your ilk are the cause of our losing the precious liberties you claim to love but in truth are willing to give up in the name of " safety. " <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> She was being ironic. I am surprised at how people are missing this. Someone decided she was a terrorist based upon how she looked, so she pointed out how silly it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy <p> I am sorry that you had to endure this terrible ordeal and I agree that what happenend to you was completely unfounded and unfair, however, I find it very ironic that you say in your blog <p> " I believe in tolerance, acceptance and trying -- as hard as it sometimes may be -- not to judge a person by the color of their skin or the way they dress. I admit to have fallen to the traps of convention and have made judgments about people that are unfounded. " <p> Yet earlier in your post you say " I stared at the yellow walls and listened to a few officers talk about the overtime they were racking up, and I decided that I hated country music. I hated speedboats and shitty beer in coozies and fat bellies and rednecks " <p> Seems to me that you do n't want to have anyone pass judgement on you because of the way that you look or dress, yet you have no problem making judgements on others. As someone who lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant people in this country have a pre-conceived notion that all Southerner 's are fat, hillbilly rednecks and that simply is not true. All I am trying to say is to not be a hypocrite in your words and deeds but to apply those same principles to others. <h> anonymous <p> Honestly Shoshana, would you have rather the authorities not have inspected you and the other two men and found that you never made it home that day to see your children? Just saying, what if the other two men had done something? You have to admit that two men, of simillar ethnic origin, sitting next to eachother getting up to the bathroom at the same time is a little strange. Often times people who sit next to someone of the same ethnic origin on a plane know eachother. Ask yourself this question, do you tend to have friends of the same ethnic origin? Or do you only have friends of a differant origin? <p> I hope everyone whom had a part in this unnecessary, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior) realize that these violations against you can not be undone, and realize that they should beg you for their forgiveness. <h> M. d'P <p> Sympathies to Shoshana, but welcome to the real world of African Americans every day -- not just on 9/11 : walking down the street in any city, flying on a plane, driving through wealthy neighborhoods -- the treatment you received because of how you look is still the norm for us. A further statement about civil liberties. <h> Aaron <p> wah wah wah. People are gon na be on pins and needles when government officials say we have a credible threat and they see suspicious behavior. Better safe than sorry and yes no one should be treated inhumanely especially when no one knows if they are doing anything wrong, but I sure wish people 10 years ago would have sent an F-16 to take down the people that had different colored skin that day. <p> You are a brave and beautiful soul, and it is a sad state of affairs when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such treatment, especially at the hands of the law. Sadder still that such divisions still exist in a world where we are all really brothers and sisters. I am a Jewish American, and though I can ' blend ' in and I am proud of my heritage, though I know many people dislike Jews here and abroad. They also do n't realize that being that being anti-arab is another form of anti-semitism as we are both semitic people, though most Jews have fairer traits, AS IF IT MATTERS! G-d bless you, you dear brave soul... May you know peace, and happiness for all of your years. <h> Ben <p> I once worked as a temp unloading refridgerated containters with boxes of chocolate into a refridgerated warehouse onto pallets for distribution to local stores. We were getting chocolate from Germany, Switzerland, and France. We were also unloading boxes of chocolate from Mexico, Columbia, and China( this was just after the recall of toys from China for using lead based paint) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few sample boxes of the German and Swiss chocolate. One day I asked him why only the German and Swiss, I was more concerned with the boxes from China and Mexico, his reply was that the boxes from Germany and Switzerland were the only ones on his list to check. Later that night I told my Father about the incedent, my Father, who had just retired from the Federal Goverment, chuckled and said " If you do not look for problems in the place they are most likley to occur you will not find them until it is too late ". Miss Shoshana I apologize for the entire ordeal, and I thank you for what you went through for everyone else 's safety. <h> John Palmer <p> We are terribly sorry to have you go through this ordeal Shoshana. We need to start finding some ways to identify, verify, than act. It appears in this case they identify and acted. This process leads to many mistakes. As a pilot, we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have asked for more verification before I make a decision and land the plane and maybe the pilots did. Unfortunately, it was September 11 and everyone was on the edge. <h> Bill <p> Shoshana, I do n't know you, and likelihood is I never will. Like many below, I am very sorry that you had to go through such an experience. What is encouraging to me, and hopefully just a bit encouraging to you and others, is that there are so many others who are outraged at what happened. Of course, I say this with all fairness in mind to those who took the actions, but I do wonder if there would have been a similar reaction if the three of you were white... As a white person in our culture, I sort of doubt it. For me, this is not merely " white guilt " at play, but rather a sad reality. I appreciate people 's alertness( the modicum, " If you see something, say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many lessons in this is that we should all take a little personal responsibility -- did any of the flight crew or potentially concerned passengers say a single thing to any of you prior to calling the authorities? From the sounds of it, probably not. In my mind, that should have been the first step -- if something concerned them, they should have done a little more investigation on their own before jumping to such rash conclusions. Unfortunately, paranoia strikes deep. I wish you the best in the future, and if nothing else, I hope that I can keep this in mind should I ever find myself profiling another human being for such an innocuous action. Peace to you. <h> Leyla <p> It is unfortunate that this happened, but I understand. If a bunch of young caucasion males had bombed Japan on flights, and then 3 caucasions end up in the same row, flying on the 10th anniversary, then it is nothing more than an unfortunate misinterpretation. Had we been more paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th anniversary. Unfortunately, for the 3 passengers, it was a wrong place at the wrong time incident. Sorry! <p> Do not believe for one minute that just because of the color of your skin and your race that they are profiling people who appear to be Middle Eastern. The color of your skin may have exacerbated the scrutiny, but that is not only factors involved! I am nothing near in appearance to anyone resembling someone from Southwest Asia or the Middle East and I was cuffed, strip searched and humiliated because the Security Officer with TSA said that my clothes were baggy, loose fitting and I seem to be carrying something concealed as I was going through the security check-point at the airport. The real kicker, I was boarding in my Military Uniform, on a Military Purchased ticket, with Military Orders to fly, with my Military ID Card and the concealed item was my cap, tucked-in behind me belt in the rear. The Security Officer said I posed a threat and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following day and I did not get someone telling me thanks for my cooperation, I got a jerk that told me that I am just as suspect as anyone else... People are bending over backward to not let profiling be the main reason for their suspicion, but it seems every-time that anyone who resembles a Middle Eastern, cries that it is just about profiling them. Stop already, those of who are not Middle Eastern and are being detained far more often that those of Middle Eastern appearance and we are not going to the media, or filing suits for discrimination and we certainly are not claiming profiling. You are not being " Profiled ", if anything, people who resemble Middle Easterner 's are receiving more benefit and avoidance from what would otherwise be a reason to detain someone. <h> What To Do? <h> Yoko <p> There did n't seem to be any other reason for her detainment other than the color of her skin and that she was sitting next to other dark skinned people who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already on the plane, had already been through security and was on her way home. I do n't think she 's being a cry baby about this. I think she 's sharing her story because people need to know what 's happening and maybe if enough people speak out, our way of doing things in situations like this will be more fair and right. Then maybe NO ONE will be cuffed, stripped, and searched, and ALL innocent americans will be able to avoid experiences like your 's and her 's. I, for one, hate when people " play the race card, " but in this case it feels totally warranted. <h> Concerned US Citizen <h> Tim <p> Sorry but the Terrorists are mostly middle eastern looking people, not american looking people. But that does not matter. What matters is you were a little inconvenienced, and luckily you were n't a threat. get over it or do n't fly. If a real problem was on the plane you would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do nt care if they check me, I want to be safe when flying..... <h> Allison <h> TJ <p> This is the world we live in. I hate the race card but its played against me often. I 'm stopped if I 'm out late in my own suburban neighborhood. And of course the story is, " we 've had reports a of stolen vehicle matching your description ". Your incident just happened on 9-11. Mines occur any evening after midnight. <h> Roberta <p> Well, I do n't know what is beautiful about this story. It is a blatant example of a violation of civil liberties. It 's a well written documentation of facts. I hope that you never have to endure anything like this ever again. I also hope that the state of our world can someday get to a point where we can feel safe and secure, and that such suspicion, detentions, searches, et. al. will be uneccessary. I am so sorry for your ordeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airlines. I am A Cherokee Nation Citizen and was " Racially Profiled " in March in a flight from St Lewis to Memphis on Delta Air Lines. No apology! Should I have Stopped a Delta Airline Employee driving down the highway and asked to see their Driver 's Licence witt out being able to articulate a seriously valid " Probable Cause To Believe " some form of violation of law or public safety had been or was being committed I would be in Deep DO-DO! As stated by one of our National Founders " Those who sacrifice essential freedonm in order to buy a little tempory security, Deserve Neither Freedom Or Security! " Homeland Security should be renamed to The " Department of Positive Paranoya "! <h> Spock <p> I agree with Erin. I am surprised at some of the comments. In fact Shoshana was very gracious given the treatment she received. Some of these comments which are critical of shoshana are harsh reminders of what will happen if Tea Party gets elected. Everyone who does not conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow citizens wake up to the true values of decency and rationality. <h> J Rodman <p> If someone makes inaccurate statements about a group, it would be making false statements. If done so willfully, it might be lies. If done so to deliberately make them look bad to damage their public character, it might be libel or slander. <p> If the Tea Party as a group is being accused of supporting racial profiling, because of the actions of a few members, then it could be called generalization. An insistence on keeping a view of the Tea Party despite any and all information might be bigotry. Deciding what they 're about before learning any real information might be prejudice. <p> However, it 's not *racial profiling* until we 're setting up police checkpoints and throwing Tea Partiers in jail. <p> Do you understand the difference between " saying mean things " and putting people into cells for arbitrary periods without any crime or reasonable suspcion thereof? Because you do n't seem to. <h> Trey <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, not black, not Asian, they were Arab!! So call it what you want, if we do nt " racially profile " we are going to get burnt again!! If we handicap ourselves by trying to be politically correct, the enemy wins because thats what they are taking advantage of. If you 're Arab in this country, stop complaining or go back to your mother land. In other words, try to be a part of the solution, not the problem. <h> Fresh kee <p> wake up dude, nobody attacked you. it was all planned and set-up by the Bush administration. do more research online........ what happen to WTC-7, not plane crashed in? Bush needed a war so he created one by killing its own citizen... the other plane that crashed has no reminant.. but they where able to pick IDs of the terrorist. Foolish satanic America, i wonder why they are always fighting..... one day America will come ruin. check 911truth.org and see more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 911 if not planned. <h> Concerned US Citizen <h> Torus <p> Timothy McVeigh. If you wan na say that racial profiling is good in order to not be attacked again, then 72 percent of the country( white people) should be carted off to cells and get strip-searched and cavity searched for no probable cause whatsoever just because of his act of terrorism. <p> Oh, and all school kids, too, because we should prevent another Columbine. <h> jerry <p> Racial profiling, boohoo. Stop the all too apparent attempt to cash in on this situation through the sympathy of the internet, although you certainly have learned to be an American, you waste of oxygen Arab. <p> Oh, please. If I hear one more Arab-American moan about being racially profiled I will be sick. You all deserve to be " profiled ' just as any other American would. If there was suspicious behavior, and you happened to be mistaken for a terrorist, you should thank your lucky stars that you live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Of course fears would be heightened on September 11. Get back to being a mother and quit wasting time blogging! <p> Americans lost their innocence because of people of your descent and their radical views. If you dislike being monitered a little more closely, please do return to your native land and do us all a favor. <h> Jen D <p> Thers -- just in case you missed it, Shosi is of Arab/American descent. Her mother is an American, her father was Saudi. This IS her native land! Having known her for the majority of our lives, I can attest that she grew up in Southern California and lived in a very normal, middle-class neighborhood, right down the street from my family. As for your assertion that she " get back to being a mother and quit wasting time blogging, " why do n't you follow your own advice and get back to doing whatever it is you should be spending your time on, rather than spouting the vitriolic B.S. you 've so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thers, What is wrong with you? Do you listen to yourself? You must be one of those ' christians ' who claims to be compassionate and loving but actually promotes hatred. This country has become disgusting, and I am embarrassed and ashamed to be considered " American " based on today 's definition and based on having countrymen like you. What have we degraded into? A bunch of paranoid idiots turning on eachother, and having no compassion at all. I am truly ashamed to call myself an American if it means being like you. <h> Allison <h> Kimship <p> Considering her native land is the United States of America, why do n't you keep your bigotry and racism to yourself so the rest of us Americans can stop feeling ashamed of our country and some of its citizens. <h> Dawn <h> B.R. <p> Thousands and thousands of people of all colors and races are searched at airports everyday since 9/11. Why must we bend over backwards for the people who actually fit the terrorist profile. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!! <h> Allison <p> Where do you go from here? Do you develope new and even more expensive technology to weed out the paranoid flyers, passengers and crew? I 'm a customer service person at an airport. I 've seen incredibly suspicious activity that was to my knowledge never taken seriously, although I hoped some system was in place between me and the plane to monitor these situations. A redneck with a race card that 's scarey. <h> rRON <p> This is too much to tolerate.Shoshana you have immense tolerance. People who have taken you for questioning needs to answer. We understand that the security is very vital. But acting without any clue is idiotic. People responsible should be taken to the courts. <h> Valerie <p> I am of Italian decent. I have black hair and olive skin. Right after 9/11, I was always pulled aside and my carry on luggage always checked. I will say that I was not treated with disrespect. The security people actually seemed a little embarrassed. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me being pulled out of line and checked. Funny, it only happened when I was traveling alone. If my husband was flying with me, I was not taken out of line. I had mixed emotions about this at the time, but I came to the conclusion that until people could move away from the fear of those aweful actions that day, I would just have to live with it. However, if what happened to this poor woman had happened to me, I know that I would have had the same feelings and anger that she had. One thing we must remember, for several days before the 10th anniversary, all we kept seeing and hearing was that there was credible terrorist threats that were received. So, given that, I guess I can understand the extra precautions. In 2001 terrorist intelligence was ignored. The administration had been told that Bin Laden had made his intentions known and still the intelligence was ignored. So, I do understand that authorities had to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately, this is the society we live in. Shoshana, I am sorry for the troubles you endured on your flight. But this is what needs to be done to protect the people of the USA. You feel that you are profiled, but is that not what Israel does? It is what needs to be done to protect the citizens of this country. Please correct me if I 'm wrong, but we were attacked on 9/11 by Muslims of Arabic descent. People who probably looked like you. If you have done nothing wrong, and have nothing to hide, what is the problem with being scutinized a little more than anyone else. The truth will prevail, and a little inconvience for National Security should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be. <h> USA forever <p> Bravo to the people who suspected you and to the police and FBI and HLS. Was it profiling? Perhaps but how many non arabs are trying to destroy America? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many " sleepers " there may be in America right now. Did the crew and passengers on the plane act out of fear? No, they are just careful and doing what is required of them during a time of war, remember everyone on that plane was also inconvenienced, a small price to pay considering if the threat turned out to be real. Is everything ok now, 10 years after 9/11/01? 1993 first attack on the WTC, 8 years later the towers fall. WAKE UP YOU FOOLS!!! FIGHT BACK! SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING! Back in 2001 when we were asked to say something if we see or even suspect something they did n't mean " just for the time being " they ment for how ever long it takes! As far as Im concerned I will never trust an arab ever again, no matter if he/she is an American citizen or not, no matter if they are terrorists or not, how are we suppose to know if they are or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best solution is suspect them all. In fact lets send em all back <h> ghf <h> ender <p> Please imagine you are a pilgrim in 1600? s and the native americans persecuted you similarly because a few members of your group committed a terrorist act. Do not pass judgements so easily. I come from a nation that has been a target of Islamic terror since 1980? s and understand where your anger comes from but to profile somebody based on the color of their skin is a throwback to the pre-civil disobidience era. Do you want that? There are no easy answers to the question of how america is going to deal with terrorism but to say that you want throw out a part of the population because of the color of their skin is ridiculous and borders on treason. Would you say the same for all white people after what timothy mcveigh did or all the black people for because of the underwear bomber from nigeria? Before you react please sit back and imagine yourself in Ms Hebshi 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan? It looks like you are accusing Ms. Shebshi of making this up? This just happened to her this past Sunday. Not 10 years ago. So, I 'm not sure what you mena when you say that " Twitter was n't around until 7 years later, so forgive my skepticism. "... What are you not getting about this, Alan Frisch? <h> Marissa <h> Jess <p> I 've been in the US for 4 years, coming from Western Europe. People think I was here all my life, or at least much, much longer than that -- except for that " something " they ca n't quite put their finger on. <p> I am truly, honestly, suffering from positive discrimination. People make it so obvious to me I 'm the kind of immigrant they want in this country. I am first in line to get a job, be considered for friends, etc. <p> I married a Hispanic man 's daughter, and it was an honor. <p> Blacks do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not offspring of slave abusers, and where I come from North-Africans are unpopular immigrants but blacks are pretty cool -- so they sense no hostility. <p> Arabs like me because I am an immigrant in America along with them and understand their culture a million times better than natives. <p> When I tell white Americans that I 'm European, their eyes go open and something like a silent AHHH comes out. Then travel stories ensue and how much they envy me growing up in those places and how much they admire me speaking several languages. And they almost never forget to mention that they traced their ancestry down to European immigrants. <p> So if I am recipient of so much " opinion " because I 'm white, just imagine what blacks, hispanics and arabs go through. But since bias is part of human nature, let 's just give everyone that nice positive bias that I 'm enjoying in this country. <h> Brenda <p> I am sorry she had to go through this but we as a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers comfy, that leaves an open door for terrorists to repeat their attacks. We already have a 9/11 to prove they will indeed attack. We want to avoid a 9/11 part 2, while also avoiding a 9/12, or a 10/2, or a 11/25. I have not flown after 9/11/2001. My skin is olive complected due to my Italian background. While being checked with the rest of the passengers and then double checked because of how I look might be uncomfortable, it makes me feel secure knowing that the checking is going on. <p> Marvin Bryer, in Los Angeles County we have installed a strange version of Homeland Security. But the people in charge, including the Glendale Cops who were previously under former Police Chief Randy Adams, who helped bankrupt the City of Bell, and has not been arrested, are the real terrorists. I just got as parking ticket that was put in my mailbox without a postage stamp, in violation of the United States Postal service laws, and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to stay off planes but cars in Glendale are also not safe. <h> Frank <h> Wim Bradford <p> I agree strongly with this comment... and i would only add that America is no longer the hopes and dreams we had for her. There 's an insanity run rampant.. though all layers of our society and our leaders... and I believe its only going to get worse. <h> mike b <p> We know this is going on all the time. Thank you for being bold enough to relate your experience to the nation. Ironically now we use repressive tactics just like the groups/nations we have been so critical of. <h> J <p> So.... lets say something had happened. Months from now people would be commenting on the ' lack of response ' to the obvious signs of an attack... the same way they did regarding Pearl Harbor and 9/11. I 'm willing to sacrifice the small discomfort of yourself( and myself) for the health and safety of all. I think we owe that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to so graphically describe such a traumatic.... strike that..... dramatic experience.... I find that sad a problem in itself. If you do n't like the manner in which this land protects its citizens.... then LEAVE. <h> Sarah S <p> Oh good, let 's have an argument about which of us Americans should leave. I vote for the ones who consider violation of Constitutional rights a ' small discomfort ' that we should all be willing to ' put up with ' for the ' greater good '. I come from a line of people who were defending the rights of ALL Americans of whatever color or religion long before there WAS an America. So if you think you 're going to put ME out of my country- well, you can think again, Buster. Bring it on. We beat you on slavery, we beat you on internment of Japanese-Americans, we beat you on Segregation, and we 'll beat you again. It may take a generation- or two- or longer yet, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no REAL American will ever sacrifice the smallest part of our own or another 's freedom out of fear. Neither will we dishonor our dead by using them as a cover for cowardice and prejudice. <h> Peter <p> I believe this is completely necessary. I consider myself American though I was not born in the U.S. I am 22 years old and have lived here since I was 2. I love the American culture, country music, and I served in the military. I am Cuban and have a dark complexion which is comparable to the Mexican appearance. Being stationed in California during a time that those of dark complexion were seized and asked for documentation or faced immediate deportation. I was driving my Jeep Wrangler with my top down, blaring country music. I had a military hair cut and Marine Corps bumper sticker. I was pulled over, searched, my Jeep was searched, and I was asked to show my papers. I was prepared because I knew what was going on. I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all driving paperwork of course. I realized that the officer was acting on orders as he had to face his on board camera as he reviewed my paperwork. I was not upset. I knew what I had coming for being a certain color. I was as cooperative and respectful as possible. Though I risked my life during 2 deployments in 2 countries, I was understanding. As should any targeted race be understanding. There is no way that you should not understand why you were seized and searched on a plane on 9/11. I believe that there was nothing unjust about your experience. I am not brainwashed. As a minority and part of an interracial marriage, I am familiar with being singled out. <p> Hi Beth, thanks for your kindness and support. Feel free to share this posting. I am a firm believer that personal accounts like this will show how little progress we have made and how far we need to go. <h> Lane L. Yarbrough <h> Junaid <p> To the person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing up is important for yourself, there are other implications of standing up for yourself in those moments. As i am muslim and indian i tend to get harassed from time to time and generally do stand up for myself, but the consequences of that are that if the story of me ever being harassed goes public, many in the media would spin it as " oh look at the muslim who would not comply with the police, they do nt care about america, if they did they would have complied. " <p> There are many ways of handling her situation, for her handling it in the manner she did was correct for her. Lets not judge the victim for their actions but rather those who can not see past a persons color. <p> Absolutely Lanie, you WIN! You win a BIG HUG, wrap your arms around yourself, close your eyes and imagine it 's me, then squeeze real tight! There is that better? Your post put a smile on my face, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D <h> Heywood Jablome <p> I was on this plane you antagonized the flight crew and security YOU did this on purpose as a publicity stunt... Yeah I saw right through you... from the TSA lines... So fucking knock off the pseudo-martyrdom... Cant wait til the videos are reviewed and they haul your useless birkenstock wearing tree-hugging, GED toting useless ass to Federal Prison... I hope you like Melissa Etheridge and Queen Latifah because you will be spending the next few years getting acquainted. Now shut this pointless nonsense blog down and turn yourself in... You 're flat out busted and everyone already knows it <h> Dvorah Waldman <p> Unbelievable. My friend shared this link on his facebook page and I 'm so sorry to hear of your story. It sounds like you were very brave and kept calm throughout. My boyfriend is half-Indian and I 'd always pooh-poohed his concerns with being racially profiled while traveling -- but no more. <p> In this country of fear and retaliation, its unfortunate that you had to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be treated that way no one does. But fear and prejudice walk hand and hand today in our society, weather its on a plane or facing you on the streets of any town America. Remember God loves you and will protect you, regardless of what man tries to do to humiliate you. <h> flutter <p> This story is enraging. We 're supposed to feel protected by such overbearing, authoritarian abuse of power? I sure do n't. The average American is more at risk of enduring the abuse of our homeland " security " agents than they are of suffering any harm at the hands of terrorists. We 're fighting terrorism with terrorism. The terrorists have won. <p> Whoa. I 'm SO sorry that happened to you. At the same time, I am so impressed with the way you conducted yourself through that ordeal AND with the thoughtful, even-tempered way you composed this post... I do n't know that I could have relayed something like this without loads of profanity and exclamation points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Kathy S. <p> Wow. I am so sorry that this happened to you! Thank you for sharing this with all of us. It brought me to tears reading it. My father( a mexican-american) has the same name as someone on the no fly list so he gets harassed every time he flies. He is a retired peace officer so though it annoys him he does n't think much of it. I guess I have always taken the stance of, it 's to protect our country so it must be ok. I am sick to my stomach at the thought of my stupidity and lack of compassion. Although I have n't seen you since high school, reading your wonderfully written words immediately brought your young smiling face to my mind! I will be sharing your story with everyone I know. As you said, we have to stop living our lives in fear of what " might " happen and move forward to the wonderful possibilities that could be if people stopped getting sucked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cover at one time or another unfairly but it is beyond out of hand. I do n't know how you refrained from smacking or at least returning some snide comment to the officers rude comment about being descended from desert people so you would n't mind that he had no air conditioning. You were much braver, calmer and tactful than I think I could ever have been! <h> Marsha Litwiller <p> My God! Ca n't imagine what you went through. To be put in handcuffs, jailed and strip searched. Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you and your damily. You are a strong woman and I am proud to know that you and my daughter Amy are friends. Marsha <p> I am so ashamed of our nation right now that this sort of thing happens to innocent civilians. Thank you for sharing this. Where is the credibility behind the suspicious other passengers felt, other than skin-tone? It 's ridiculous. I am very sorry that this happened to you. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being very upset the entire time. You handled yourself much better than I would ever hope to in a situation like that. I am glad that you are home with your family and friends. I also hope the men that shared this horrible experience with you are doing well( as they can be given this horrible event.) I found a link to your story on one of my friend 's facebook pages and I have shared it as well. I thought our country stood for something better than this sort of thing... <h> thankful <p> I 'm sorry I have to leave this site I ca n't believe many of you people dissing the land of the free if you are so unhappy then maybe you should find another place to live yourselves it was terrible what happened but I can understand why, we want to make all Americans safe not just some <p> wow! a spate of " if you do n't like America, leave " comments, and now let 's be thankful Thankful has made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberties, regardless of the ancestry of those whose liberty has been restricted. This case is made all the worse due to accusers not accountable and the guilty until proven innocent aspect. If you know your History, sounds rather like the Inquisition, which was also a case of " sovereignity ". <p> I want America to be safe. I love the fact that I am able to make comments like this because I live in a nation where I have the freedom to speak my mind. I am against unreasonable search and seizures and so is our Constitution( the Fourth Amendment.) <p> I ca n't understand why any citizen would be stripped, humiliated and treated like an animal. I 'm sorry that you( who did not leave a real name) seem to think that this sort of behavior against a citizen is o.k. to " make all Americans safe not just some. " <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Yeah, that 's the way for change, just runaway. How about stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what this land is about. People are complaining about our rights being compromised. So if you do n't like our rights, you are welcome to leave. <h> Concerned US Citizen <h> Torus <p> The United States is not perfect. And, in order to make it perfect, we have to fight policies we do n't agree with and stand up for what we believe in. That is one of our rights in this country, and a right to revolution is one of the things this country is based on. <p> We do this because we love our country. Blind support is not a good way to show one 's love for anything. <h> Jason Plemons <h> teresa <p> I also am so sorry. I know that does not help.... but I look at all of my many shapes and colors of kids at school( a high school you I understand you know well) and pray that they never have to suffer through this. It makes me angry.... but I too hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> Bill <p> I saw this posted on Google+. I 'm so sorry you experienced this. I have some Arabic friends who 've also been hassled because of 911. It 's a sad, sad day when people have to worry about being treated this way because of the way they look. <p> I 'm so sorry that this happened. Celeste shared your post on FB and I 'm passing it on. I was thinking yesterday that the Arab-Americans, Sikhs, Muslims, and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the fallout do n't have anyone commemorating what THEY went through after 9/11. And that 's not a story we 'll hear on the news anytime soon. <p> I could n't have said it better myself. I wrote about the exact same thing yesterday -- why is no one talking about the freedoms lost for those groups as a result of " defending America 's freedom "? <p> I 'm sickened that this is happening to so many around the country, and so sorry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing your story. I agree with you that personal accounts will hopefully show how little progress we have made. <h> pete.d <p> There are other things we can do, including pressuring our elected representatives to represent us instead of the TSA jobs program. But economic power is in the hands of the airlines, and only because travelers give it to them. <p> Take that economic power away, and the airlines will be the first to start lobbying for sanity to be restored to our transportation system. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> The Transportation Security Administration( TSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that exercises authority over the safety and security of the traveling public in the United States <h> nic. <p> Oh yes, very quickly and competently. You know why? Because most Arabs( those living in the West Bank and Gaza) are not allowed to fly to airports in Israel. They come in via Amman through the land border, where the process may take many hours( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Very quickly indeed. If you would like more racial profiling, though, you should definitely follow the Israeli example. <h> Calin Brabandt <p> &gt; The Nuremberg trials set the precedent that " I was only following orders " is no defense. <p> Sadly, this moral concept did n't stick after Nuremberg and it continues to be eroded every day. It no longer exists in the " law industry, " despite the best efforts of many orgainizations, including " Oath Takers. " <p> Cops and soldiers are robots. They believe their actions and the consequences of their actions are never their own moral responsibilities. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Wow -- I wish I could say I 'm shocked at this, but I feel like shock would be naive. Still, it absolutely galls me to no end to think of innocent citizens being treated like criminals, like dirt, based on nothing other than the suspicions of others... suspicions which are based in their own prejudices. <p> I am so sorry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despicable experience, and grateful to you for sharing it. I think it is extremely important that people see the awful results of bigoted hyper-vigilance, of marginalizing people as bogeymen based on whispers and lies, of pat refusal to believe certain people are good people. It can only lead to a bad place, no matter what they try to claim about " security " and " freedom ". <h> Allison <h> M <p> That 's what I felt too, after reading the media report. It 's one of those typical reports that leave you with the vague notion that the govt was doing its job and that the people detained probably did something to warrant the detention. That 's terrible that for 10 years we 've been hearing reports like this and the media has actually not been covering the detainees point of view. The media, early on, decided to side with a falsely-defined patriotism instead of journalistic integrity. <h> BayAreaBiker <p> One other thing -- I am never flying Frontier, EVER. Whatever ghosts this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " **39;5953;TOOLONG... the flight attendant could have used her/his commmon sense to first enquire and then reported the men. Had they been real terrorists, they could have blown the plane right after the F-16 showed up. <h> JayMonster <p> Just out of curiosity, where exactly are the " lies " that you speak of? Thee people detained on " suspicion "( based on the article, it seems the suspicious person was a Frontier Airlines Flight Attendant), and nothing suspicious was found, this after questioning, they were released. <p> Yes, it sounds far more routine in the press, but, I fail to see where the comment that the press is lying comes from. <h> s. <h> guest <p> actually, the " mainstream " media reported this exactly the same way as she said -- the three people were arrested because someone overacted about 2 brown men maybe spending " too much " time in the bathroom. Other than not knowing the personal details she reported here, what did the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is n't any different at all. It just tells the incident from a perspective of somebody who was n't personally involved. I do n't think any facts in that article differ from what this woman has said -- she just has more facts from what happened to her personally. <h> St. Exuperantius <p> There 's a significance difference between writing that someone had been released after questioning and writing that someone had been handcuffed, locked in a cell, strip searched, interrogated, and then released. " Questioning " sounds benign and less invasive than what happened. <p> I 'm sorry that you had this experience, but happy that you conducted yourself so much better than I probably would have. My only question : How are the " authorities "( I sense a hint of derision when you used that word) to know the suspicions of the person who reported what they believed they saw were based on racism or stereotype? <p> Should they ask you : " Are you a terrorist " and based merely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way? Your post is n't specific, but it does n't appear your search was a cavity search( which makes it no less embarrassing to you as an individual). But, again, how are the authorities to know you 're not concealing weapons or materials without a search? <p> The frustrating thing about your entire situation was that you were innocent and got caught up in either a report by an outright racist or more likely, an overly-frightened citizen who probably should do a better job of looking for acts rather than skin color. But, if I am on a plane and *I* see something I really believe is suspicious, am I to only report white men who are suspicious? If I see what I THINK is suspicious activity by a person of Middle-Eastern or Southwestern Asian descent, should I dismiss it, assume I 'm just profiling the person? <p> Sure, your reasonable perception of the situation is that you were profiled and the big, bad authorities were completely wrong -- because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without investigation? <p> The point -- I do n't think I understand how the problem you see can be " solved " without people simply not reporting anything. I guess I 'm wondering : Is reporting suspicious activity ok as long the person turns out to be a terrorist? But profiling if they are not? I understand, as a white male, I have the benefit of privilege and the consequences of profiling and racism are hard for me to " feel ". But, I 'd simply ask you this : Would n't any other innocent person have the right to feel what you felt on a basic level -- you were inconvenienced, made to feel humiliated, anxious about what was going on... but aside from the " why was I picked ", any innocent person of any race or ethnicity would feel that way, no? <h> Chris <p> Thank you so much for you comment. I totally agree. Where is the middle ground? How can we be safe and still respectful? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been detained and humiliated but had a chance to go home and tell their families about it. I totally agree that this was awful for Shoshana. It breaks my heart, but what is the solution? <p> Actually, the victims of 9/11 would probably have settled for locks on the cockpit door, not to mention SOMEONE paying attention to the report that said " Bin Laden determined to strike inside U.S. " with a response more serious than a month-long vacation. <h> ADP <p> Actually, at Ben Gurion they 've found just asking " Are you a terrorist? " to be very effective at screening. I do n't think she 's saying people should n't report anything. But as long as we remain ignorant of what actually constitutes a *real* threat, we 're going to be wasting a lot of time and money on fears borne of racism. <h> Crafty Trilobite <p> How about we worry less about the very remote possibility of dying by terrorist and more about the human rights of our fellow citizens? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really such a nation of cowards that we willingly go along with it in exchange for a modicum of( false) security? <h> Johnny <h> Bhazulle <p> Amen Crafty. I would rather take my chances with the " Terrorists " and possibly, remotely run the risk of losing my life,( As opposed to the 1-30 chance everytime I merge into traffic) then the very real, very direct threat of living under a totalitarian government hell bent on " Protecting " me to, well, death. I 'll take my chances with my dark skinned Middle eastern neighbor. He 's a nice guy, known him since the 5th grade. I could probably take him in a fight. Verymuch doubt I could take the body armor clad jackboot kicking in my door in the middle of the night because someone may or may not have heard me swear to loud at the television set. <h> Laurna Macnear <p> I 'm guessing that she was thoroughly searched by TSA before boarding the plane.... is n't that why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know your next flight and we can call ahead and arrange for you to be pulled off the plane in handcuffs, strip-searched in an open cell, not told what is going on, not allowed to contact your family or an attorney and we 'll see how safe you feel! <p> Corey, please re read the post. The gentlemen seated next to her came under suspicion because someone thought they took a long time in the bathroom( turns out one of ' em was airsick), and she was yanked out simply for sitting next to them. Ask yourself, if she was not brown, would she have been detained? That 's the point. Its easy to take the privelage of being presumed innocent when you 've never experienced what its like to be presumed guilty. <h> Wendy <p> The average, random citizen is no more well equipped to determine if a behavior is " suspicious " than they are to teach a class of kindergarteners or diagnose a heart condition. These mistakes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something " logic until there is a well-disseminated and standardized set of activities defined as suspicious. This may be an unreasonable goal but it just illustrates the flaw made when " authorities " call for and give credence to these reports of suspicion. You are being ridiculous and flippant when you comment about only reporting white males making suspicious behavior. Racial profiling is unamerican and unethical, period. If there were statistics to support the " see something say something " policy the media would be parading them out every time a situation like this occurs. It is my " suspicion " that the vast majority of tips from folks who think they 've observed suspicious behavior do n't ever lead to the arrest of any true terrorist. <h> Abhi <p> Dear genius, how many American citizens were in on the 911 plot? They should have simply taken her to some room( as opposed to a cell), asked her for her citizenship details, and once they found out that she was a citizen, they should have let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question much. And the way they treated her should have been in proportion of the evidence that the other person/coward gave. " I think I saw a knife in her handbag " gets you stripsearched. " Was doing stuff that most people do, except that she looks arab/asian " should just trigger a mere check of citizenship. Perhaps you should let us know how many American citizens carried out 911 attack. But apparently you belong to the group of brain-dead people who would strip-search and suspect the pilot too, at boarding time( clue : The pilot does n't needs guns or weapons to crash the plane. I had to point it out since you are incapable of thinking this by yourself apparently) <h> Just a thought <p> @Abhi, Abuse of another poster in this forum is most unfortunate. Your opinions on the issue add to the discussion, abusive language and name calling do not. Respect for others is part of the issue here. <p> No Americans were part of the 9/11 plot. But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; also consider Eric Robert Rudolph( Olympic Park bombings) ; Nidal Malik Hasan( the American-born, US Army-serving psychiatrist who massacred troops at Fort Hood) ; the Unabomber whose last name I can never spell, etc. <p> Assuming that American citizenship precludes terrorist activity is just as naive, short-sighted, and troublesome as assuming that brown skin predicts it. <h> In Respect <p> Thank you! Add to the list Richard Reid, the AMERICAN shoe bomber or the AMERICAN born convert to Islam, Anwar al-Awlaki who routinely calls for death to Americans and encourages attacks from " within ". Sorry, citizenship is no longer cause to assume someone " ca n't possibly be a terrorist ". <h> M <p> You said : " The frustrating thing about your entire situation was that you were innocent and got caught up in either a report by an outright racist or more likely, an overly-frightened citizen who probably should do a better job of looking for acts rather than skin color. " <p> I think your use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racist is. If someone, who witnesses no suspicious acts, and yet is frightened because of nothing more than a person 's skin color, as you described in the second phrase, then they are a racist, so your options appear to be racist or... racist. <h> M <p> The common man/woman is not an expert in terrorism and the govt should stop empowering them to think that they are. We are not the first country to be hit by terrorism and there 's a lot to be learned from other countries that have many more years of experience than we do. We also need to study world history and understand things like the Gestapo. If you do n't understand how problems can be solved without people not reporting anything, that 's ok because you 're not an expert. But at least understand the huge danger in actually having people report things and what that can lead to. <p> Corey -- that one is actually kind of easy. We have long held that the accused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tried by a jury of his peers. Not reported by ' someone ' and held &; searched on account of " It 's 9/11 and people are seeing ghosts. They are seeing things that are n't there. " <p> The 4th Amendment to the U.S. and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. " <p> And yeah, she kinda did make it clear that it was a cavity search " Because I am so violent. And pulling me off an airplane, handcuffing me and patting me down against a squad car did n't offer enough protection. They also needed to make sure all my orifices were free and clear. " You ca n't exactly check " orifices " without a cavity search. <p> No one swore out an Oath, nor was there a Warrant. If you wanted to report a suspicious person outside your house? You 'd have to make a statement to the police and you 'd have to be willing to stand up to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the SCOTUS to get around to actually admitting it, but if you think a warrantless strip search, where the person being detained is denied the right to legal counsel, is denied the right to know what the charges are or the grounds for this kind of search is n't " unreasonable " then I would submit humbly that you 've never found yourself in such a position. What if one of the people sitting in that row had been a 12 year old? Not so reasonable all of the sudden. <p> If there is a person acting suspiciously near the playground of a school? You still have to be willing to make a statement to the police. If you choose to do it as an ' anonymous tip ' somehow -- the police have to then find some justification( legal justification) to get a warrant to search that person 's house -- let alone his/her body cavities. The fact that the 3 people in that row were treated differently than the rest of the passengers and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me it was for my own protection as they had brought in the rest of the passengers for questioning " tells you that it was based on fear. If she was n't guilty of anything? Why not just say loudly as you return her to the same area as the rest of the passengers " We 're sorry ma'am. We had to follow procedure. Clearly this was in error, you are free to go. "? <p> From what is written here, it 's clear that the FBI agents had time to have done a background check. It 's also clear that the police were in no imminent danger of a woman handcuffed with her hands behind her back in a small locked cell somehow magically exploding some device contained inside her that she had waited to set off until the plane had landed, sat on the tarmac for 30 minutes, and been stormed by security. <p> In theory, terrorists with devices like that would actually *use* it on the plane, or at least, long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waiting until finding themselves handcuffed, alone, and helpless in a cell.( p.s. ultrasound or xray is far more efficient than a cavity search and considerably less invasive.) <p> The point is n't " well how can we be sure to get the bad guys if we do n't do this? " but instead " is this approach actually netting any ' bad guys '? If not, why are we stripping random Americans of their civil liberties and legal rights because someone on a plane has an over-active imagination? " <p> Really, the security theater has got to stop now. We 've got to grow up and use techniques proven by decades of use in places like Israel. Because there was a point in time not so long ago, that the thought of *anyone* treated that way by a government was obscene. It was the bogieman presented to young, naive travelers headed overseas " do n't do anything wrong -- you might get thrown in a Turkish prison and never be seen again! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real. But now, just as equally, someone in Turkey could say the same to his children as they head toward the U.S. now. <p> @Lucretia, THANK YOU for this post! You are the first person to have pointed out what I thought when I first read the news article( before reading this blog post)... If Shoshana or the other two passengers had meant any harm they would have done it BEFORE they ever landed! Detaining them and " strip searching " them after they landed is like patching a whole in a boat after it has sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Too little, too late. <p> I am not completely opposed to SOME racial profiling -- but it should have been done before they ever got on the plane. What happened here is outrageous. Beyond absurd. And the person(s) who reported the " suspicious behavior " aught to be tarred and feathered! <p> Shoshana 's " racial prejudices " that resulted while she was being detained were totally understandable. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place. She had done nothing more suspicious than fly on 9/11. The whole " standard procedure " stuff is bull crap and someone( maybe several someones) really screwed up in their jobs. She and the other two men who were detained deserve a formal apology from the President of the US, the airline they were flying, and the FBI for wrongful detainment and invasion of privacy. Their rights were most definitely violated! <p> My husband is in the Army, currently deployed -- he found this article and told me about as HE is outraged and thinks someone really screwed up. This is n't the kind of " Freedom " he is fighting for he told me and he said that " they " should be really glad she is being so understanding about all of this! <h> Jess <p> Shoshana, I 'm going to be blunt and honest about what I experience where I live. It will probably hurt you, and I ask your forgiveness. I hope it will also help us start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the complaint of suspiscion said, per Scott Wintner, a Detroit Metropolitan Airport spokesman, as reported in the NYT : <p> " -- multiple passengers holed up in the bathroom -- led to F-16s shadowing Frontier Airlines Flight 623 from Denver as it neared Detroit. " <p> Given the existence of the Mile High Club, there was a time when " multiple passengers holed up in the bathroom " would 've resulted in nothing more than giggles and smirks. If Homeland Security( could we have named it anything more Nazi-evocative?) believes people in an airplane bathroom together usually indicates a terrorist plot, they should simply issue a rule against it similar to those against smoking. They make the flight attendants threaten us with Federal punishment during the pre-flight talk if we do n't comply with that! <p> The point is, Shoshana never was in the bathroom with her seatmates, nor they in the bathroom together as far as she knows. Some simple, discreet questioning of the passengers seated near the bathrooms by the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none of this need have happened. " Has there been more than one person in the bathroom at the same time? " Duh. <p> I have a feeling the profiling started during seat assignment, actually, knowing several airline employees. There 's a sense of entitlement to consider the " sensitivities " you talk about, Corey, and I suspect the three were seated together because they had " funny names ". That way, " real Americans " would n't have to sit next to someone who might make them " uncomfortable ". Just lump all of " them " together where we can watch ' em. <p> What if we turned our fear on its head and behaved as if we had no fear? That would mean approaching someone we felt suspiscious about and engaging them in a friendly way. What if the accuser had simply looked Shoshana and her seatmates in the eye, smiled, and asked, " How 's it going? " There 's an awful lot to learn from body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone sweating all out of proportion to the temperature, I 'm gon na ask if they feel alright. I 'm gon na offer to get them a cool wet paper towel from the bathroom, or a dose of aspirin. How they react to kindness will be most revealing, and then I can decide whether to get help from the authorities. <p> Speaking of the authorities, how does it make anyone safer to treat a suspect roughly unless they are physically resisting? Too many cop shows where they take a person down for asking questions when they 've been told to shut up -- it 's outrageous! <p> And since when do we think it 's OK to handcuff people without arresting them, Mirandizing them, and stating what they 're charged with? Since September 11, that 's when. <p> The Constitution does n't mention " detainees ". You 're either under reasonable suspiscion( probable cause) or you 're not. This dangerous gray area is an invention that 's being used by police now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk ". " If you have n't done anything wrong, you have nothing to fear. " That 's complete BS, and every citizen should retain a healthy level of disdain for the authorities. <p> Look, if our main concern is whether we might die in a terrorist act, we will lose this country. We must each be willing to die for our freedom or it will be taken from us. A strip search for the protection of the authorities? I thought they were all heroes, which implies bravery and the willingness to lay down their lives for Constitutional principles. <p> No, the strip search is an enhanced interrogation technique meant to make the detainee feel helpless and break down resistance. If nothing else, everyone reading Shoshana 's story should contact all their elected representatives and insist that it can not take place until a suspect is duly arrested under probable cause and is entering the jail. <p> http : //www.congress.org/ lets you find all your state and national representatives by just entering your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Bookmark it. You 're gon na need it. <h> Kit Walker <h> Mike <p> The authorities could have asked questions or had a discussion with the three people instead of cuffing them, marching them off the plane, jailing them, strip searching them, and generally humiliating and terrifying them. There was no indication of any violence, imminent threat, or crime. So why these measures? <p> That does n't solve the problem of nervous nellies reporting routine behavior as suspicious, but it certainly mutes the negative impacts. Police used to be skilled in de-escalating situations ; now they seem only to escalate them. <p> If the police had a five minute chat with the three people, the crew, and a few other passengers, we would n't even be reading about this terrible incident. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> I 'm friends with a policeman and I hate to say it, but they are all taught to be distrusting of everyone and are completely paranoid. And it 's not a stereotype ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's legal for them to lie to you in questioning. <h> Angi <p> Well it would help if the proper authorities followed the dictate of our rule of law -- innocent until proved guilty. This woman, and the two men, could have been taken off the plane and questioned respectfully. To be taken off, handcuffed, strip searched and put in containment based on a civilian witness 's opinion is unreasonable and against everything we purport to stand for. <p> Common sense seems to have gotten lost along with our ability to react appropriately to situations. <h> AFC <p> You write : " My only question : How are the " authorities "( I sense a hint of derision when you used that word) to know the suspicions of the person who reported what they believed they saw were based on racism or stereotype? " <p> I 'm a little dismayed that you would ask such a question. The " authorities " should simply ask them whether there is any basis for their suspicion. If the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone( whether they chalk it up to racism, or whatever else). If the answer is " yes, " then they should ask them what it is. If the answer to that is, " they just do n't look right to me "... well, then what do *you* think should follow? <p> Basically, if there is actual evidence of criminal activity backing up a " suspicion, " then it should be acted upon. If there is no evidence of criminal activity backing up a " suspicion, " then the lack of evidence should suffice to guarantee the treatment of persons as innocents. In neither case should " suspicion " itself be in any way a criterion for any kind of action by police. <h> Steve Bock <p> Every year, about 37,000 Americans die in traffic accidents. The chances of a the average American being killed by a terrorist are astronomical. We do n't strip search everyone who gets in a car and drives. <p> Your euphemisms are very telling. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, jailed, and strip searched -- for no probable cause, without reasonable suspicion, without search warrant, due process, or cause. <p> You have the gall to euphemistically dismiss her ordeal as " made to feel humiliated, anxious about what was going on ". <h> mr <p> Ummm..... and more than 1.2 million U.S. citizens are stopped each year for suspicion of driving under the influence and released because they 're determined safe to drive. Granted, they are n't subjected to strip searches( at least I hope not) -- but that 's simply because the risk associated with your average drunk driver simply pales in comparison to the risk associated with your average mass terrorist and a more extreme vetting process simply is n't prudent. These drivers are, however, questioned, tested, potentially humiliated, etc. Clearly the experience of a cavity search is undoubtedly more uncomfortable than a simple " walk the line " test, but the principle is exactly the same. Lots of perfectly safe drivers are pulled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't fun. But that 's the deal -- at least if you want to keep drunks off the road. <p> Simple analogy. But you get the point. Now, let the name-calling begin.... <h> mr <p> Corey, despite your poor choice of baseball teams( :)), you are otherwise a sharp, acute observer. Short answer -- there is no clear-cut " middle ground. " There simply is n't a " right way " for authorities to do the jobs we all expect them to do.... they MUST do.... without frustrating, offending and sometimes even scaring some of us. The risk is simply too great to err on the side of trust and faith. Unfortunately, we can no longer afford to be naive... a few undereducated cowards in airplanes literally ran that option into the ground ten years ago. Perhaps Shosh should aim more of her vituperation at them, since their actions were the ultimate source of her recent humiliating experience. I 'm guessing Jeremy Glick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and a strip search, but maybe that 's just me. <p> As for the aforementioned authorities violating their constitutional rights.... thankfully, most of us understand clearly that the report of suspicious behavior in this particular case, given the context and circumstances, more than warranted probable cause. I could n't give a flip about skin color, taste in music or penchant for drinking cheap beer( quick side note : nowhere in Shosh 's account does she mention that her " accuser " is white... would n't it be sad, and a bit ironic, to find out he/she was, let 's say, a little Vietnamese woman?). No, really.... let me confirm.... I simply do not care WHO looks like WHAT and how they prefer to cut their hair. I lost my " right " to do that when I watched a few thousand unsuspecting 9-to-5ers follow their morning coffee with a refreshing jump out of a 100+ story building. I 'm sure the posters on this thread can understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fortunate that you represent a vast( if not ' silent ') majority of Americans who may not be entirely comfortable with the current means of protecting ourselves but understand that a trade-off is now, unfortunately, a part of our lives. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> I guess you did n't read her blog completely and missed this or else you do n't know the definition of orifice : " Because I am so violent. And pulling me off an airplane, handcuffing me and patting me down against a squad car did n't offer enough protection. They also needed to make sure all my orifices were free and clear. " <p> All my orifices means " all. " She 's already humiliated enough, so does she have to go into detail? Her statement is quite clear. <h> steve <h> saireygamp <p> Bullshit. The Patriot Act was passed by a Democratic congress and signed by a Republican president, then re-upped by a Republican congress and Democratic president. <p> At the end of the day, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government. If President Obama, Eric Holder, or Janet Napolitano wanted to stop these egregious violations of the fourth amendment, they could. They 've been running DHS and TSA for three years now. It 's nonsense to blame this on Bush/Cheney. <p> The act was definitely supported by far more Rs than Ds. Yes, Obama could use executive order to modify the agencies, but Presidents rarely institute major changes in programs instituted by their predecessors without an act of Congress, and the President 's job is to enforce law created by Congress, not to modify it. Yes, he could have vetoed the reauthorization, but the veto would have been overridden, and Presidents hate it when that happens. <h> RR <p> Some folks will really do a lot of mental acrobatics to avoid opening their eyes to Obama being Bush II, no? The fact is he has failed to lead on this, either because he agrees that Justice, Homeland Security, etc are acting appropriately in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on his agenda of choice : forcing Americans into a government-run healthcare scheme that many of them do n't want. But, please, the man has been President of the United States for nearly a full term now, and he started it off with Democrat majorities in both chambers ; sorry, but if you want to make this a " partisan " issue, you 'll have to work harder than the above to convince me. At what point exactly do we start holding a President accountable for what he has or has not done to advance American principles? You know, things like LIBERTY? The Hope and Change kool-aid has gotten rather stale. <h> Liz <p> Bullshit right back at you. Bush pushed a " if you 're not with us you 're against us " agenda and he and Cheney worked diligently to ensure that gullible Americans believed that anyone who opposed the " Patriot Act "( most definitely named that for a reason) was a terrorist sympathizer and America-hater. It was career suicide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure of it. They played on our irrational fears born of a horrific attack and they made the most of them, creating laws that stripped us of our Constitutional rights and subjecting innocent people to torture and imprisonment without charges. The actions of the " authorities "( and the derisive tone is deliberate and deserved) are the direct result of Bush and Cheney. <h> Allison <h> Bk4 <h> Jeff Guilfoyle <p> Wow. Thank you for writing this, and on behalf of your FELLOW American citizens, I am truly truly sorry that you were treated this way. Know that I, a white male, feel violated reading what happened to you. What happens to one of us, happens to all of us. A little more of my faith in this country slipped away, just as the principles and beliefs our country was founded upon have slipped away. You writing this is standing up for those principles, however, and doing so publicly would have made our Founding Fathers proud. <p> Well said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. It is disgusting and appalling. I am reminded of the internment camps that Americans of Japanese descent were shuffled into during WW2. The comparison may seem a bit dramatic perhaps, but that does n't make it any less true. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> The Transportation Security Administration( TSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that exercises authority over the safety and security of the traveling public in the United States. 1 The TSA was created as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, sponsored by Don Young in the United States House of Representatives2 and Ernest Hollings in the Senate, 3 passed by the 107th U.S. Congress, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. Originally part of the United States Department of Transportation, the TSA was moved to the Department of Homeland Security on March 25, 2003. John S. Pistole is the fifth TSA Administrator, having replaced former head Kip Hawley. 4 http : **35;5994;TOOLONG... <h> Jess <p> Yeah OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who illegally detained and violated her says " DHS " not " TSA ". The TSA people are not qualified to perform arrests without the supervision of other agencies.( As if one could imagine anyone less qualified than those who acted in this case.) <p> Thank you for your account. I 'm so sorry that this had to happen to you... or to anyone. This makes me even more ashamed to be an American, disgusted and very angry. Not in my country, dammit! I sincerely hope you and everyone else involved in the " 50 other similar incidents across the country " will file a lawsuit over this violation of your civil rights. This paranoid insanity has to stop or we might as well just tear up the constitution and forget about ever having had any freedoms. <h> phyllis <p> I am so sorry that this happened to you. I can only hope that whoever cast dispersions on you and your seatmates was subjected to the same degree of humiliation and scrutiny that you faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious behavior to be reported, but that any such reporting be viewed by authorities to include all persons who may vouch for an accurate account of why you were viewed in a negative light. I hope you were compensated in some way for the frightening and pointless humiliation you experienced. <h> Nancy <p> thank you for sharing your experience. I would have been losing it. I was screaming while I read this. The only way to fight this is to get these stories out there.( heard about it from Nick Kristof 's tweet.) <p> I 'm not at all surprised to read this story in the Amerika of post-9/11. I 'm sorry this happened to you, but I 'm glad that you were not treated even worse -- Imagine if all the officers you dealt with were as stupid and ignorant as the one that gave you a ride to your car. <p> I 've shared this post on three social networks. You have my compassion and my empathy. Please never, ever stop writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't experience them yourself, and encourage others to do the same. It 's only by spreading awareness can we hope to overcome the apathy that tells us we ca n't effect any change. <p> Even the first black President has wimped out at ending the Patriot Act type spying by the FBI, CIA, NSA, and so on.... as well as the unjustifiable treatment of other people whose skin is n't lily white. <h> Mister Aloha <p> Duhhh, sorry but I 'm an American not a Amerikan. I live in America not Amerika. Oh, and easy for you to talk cause by your photo, your skin is " lily white. " I feel more for the ones that lost their lives in the 9-11 tragedy then her being questioned and strip searched, she is still alive, she still has her family. Those in the Twin Towers are not here, their family misses them. And there were " The Encyclopedia of 9/11. Total number killed in attacks( official figure as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their lives cause of 4 planes that were hi-jacked..... by some of that were of the same color and race.... If you ARE an AMERICAN, you will understand! GOD BLESS THE U.S.A. If you do n't like it, please leave, there are other countries that would love your citizenship. <p> You do n't know me. A friend of mine on Google+ shared the link to your story, and I was compelled to read it. I am outraged at the way you were treated. I am shocked that this can happen in this country. I am so sorry for the way you were treated, and I hope that you will be ok. My heart goes out to you. Keep telling your story. People need to hear this! <p> I have a problem with patriotism, I find it agressive and dangerous. I have been pondering a world without it and think it would be good for all but then I 'm reminded that religion is the real problem, hopefully in 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 3000 years ago from now. <h> Toni Lupo Ruso <p> Soshana, I was shocked and saddened as I read this. We have not spoke or seen eachother since high school but I remember you as such a nice and accepting person. Not sure I could have shown the same strength in the given situation. I am proud to know you and wish to help spread the word. Your friend -- Toni <h> kerry <p> Fear is such a dangerous thing. I 'm Canadian and I do n't think we have the same culture of fear that 's been stewing in the States in this last decade, but I still see it and still sometimes have to actively say " no " to being sucked into a lifestyle of fear. I think we 're really being taught to fear what is different or unfamiliar... and who, I guess -- religiously, ethnically, politically. Even though I know better, sometimes I have to talk myself down : " no, being afraid of people who are unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not give in to the hype and the media and the unfairness. I will not be afraid. " <p> I hope you are able to find peace &; resolution in the wake of yesterday. I wish you blessings. <h> Kathryn Quigley <p> What happened to you is absolutely disgusting, and shows how paranoid some people really are. It shows the real problems of the paranoia people have increasing had since 9/11, something I 've seen quite a lot of over time. <p> It seems some of those here would have been better used at the Dallas Cowboys-New York Jets game at Met Life Stadium in The Meadowlands Sunday night, where a man was able to get a stun gun past security and incite a brawl in the stands during the game. <p> Declan McCullagh shared your post over on G+, and I am so pissed on your behalf, I can hardly see straight! I 'm so sorry this happened to you! My husband is of Syrian extraction and is constantly being yanked aside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this badly mistreated. <p> On a different note, I read back an entry, and see that you are newly arrived to Toledo. As it happens, I live in Toledo, and except for a year and a half abroad, have lived here all my life. Toledo does n't seem like much to new transplants, but we actually have a lot of lovely little jewels hidden amongst the weeds here and in the surrounding areas. Pop me a note at Facebook -- I 'm logged in with it -- and I 'll be glad to give you the low down on the Glass City. <p> Friend request sent! I do n't use the FB chat feature because every time I do, the whole world wants to talk, but I happily answer messages! After you add me back, I 'll send you my AIM name. Only a few people know that, it 's easier to keep up with! <p> Shoshana, in Toledo there is a woman who has been talking out about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community and steer people away from blindly making stereotypes about people of Arab heritage. Her name is Fatima Al-Hayani, and you may want to look her up, I 'm sure she would love to hear your story, if she has n't already. I have n't spoken with her since I was a student of hers back in the late 90? s, but I do know that she is still very involved with the local Arab community. Here is a new article that she was featured in a few years back : http : **35;6031;TOOLONG... <p> OMG! What an experience. And I thought I had it bad when they detained me in Denver for asking for a flight attendant 's name who 'd been excessively rude so I could write a letter of complaint. You sure you do n't have a false imprisonment charge? I 'm glad you 're OK, except for the emotional trauma! Take good care of yourself! <p> I 'd ask you to consider a different perspective -- that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a *lack* of profiling. If we had real air security, instead of the theatre we engage in today, we would have professionals, trained in body language and psychology, screening people at the airport. What you experienced, which was reprehensible and inexcusable, was a result of that " report suspicious behavior " nonsense -- relying on the uninformed and untrained to report things. <h> IncensedAndPerturbed <p> Everything was on the up and up. The officers were just following procedure based on legislation that the ignorant populace allowed to be instated. We do n't need lawyers we need protests to demand change. <p> How you were treated is horrifying. I 've shared this on FB, SU and Twitter. I just hope this is one more smack to the head of the American people -- this violation of human rights and our Constitution has got to stop. <p> I saw your link posted on Missy 's Facebook page. This disgusts me, I am so sorry to hear about your ordeal. What sickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and his new wife( both who are white and look it) travelled through TWO airports with a 6-inch hunting knife he had mistakenly left in his backpack. Security did not find the knife at the San Diego airport, nor at the Atlanta airport. Finally, leaving Miami for their international flight, it was discovered. Although I 'm glad they did n't get into trouble as it was an innocent mistake, I am horrified that a knife was brought on to 2 different flights!! They go to all this effort to harass and humiliate completely innocent people because of their race, but ca n't find a knife in the x-ray machines?! It 's ridiculous. <h> Azazel <p> Absolutely. Making false terrorism reports is, in fact, a crime. The fact is there was no " suspicious behavior " ; spending " too long " in a bathroom is not suspicious behavior. I would strongly suggest seeing if you can get them prosecuted for making a false report. I know there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never supported the Patriot Act because racist and paranoid people can do shit like this to citizens. It 's akin to The Spanish Inquisition in that a mere accusation is enough to set it in motion. I am so sorry they treated you like this and I 'm especially angry at the racist passenger(s) who instigated it. My granddaughter is half-Iraqi and my grandsons are half Mexican and I shudder to think of the bullshit they 'll encounter from people like that. Thank you for speaking out. I would encourage everyone to write to their representatives about the excesses of The Patriot Act. <p> I am so sorry -- and infuriated -- to hear of your ordeal. That 's not even an adequate word to describe it. Violation. Humiliation. Abuse. And all because of the paranoia and hysteria that has taken over this country. Every person who has ever defended the DHS, who has ever been an apologist for the TSA, who has ever uttered the monumentally stupid shibboleth, " as long as it keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. And to countless others. The 9/11 victimology of this country, fed by a complicit media, has got to stop. We are on a very dark path. <p> This is intense. I am incredibly appalled and saddened that this happened to you. I just saw this link on my feed on Twitter. Someone had retweeted it. I 'm sharing your story with my friends so that they know. I am so sorry that you had to go through this and I 'm glad you 've made it home now. No one should be treated like this. <p> I 'm equal parts amazed and horrified by this story. Thank you for writing about it. I do n't understand how anyone could call themselves an American and not be ashamed at the way we treat our own just to keep up the charade of security. <h> W Scott Lincoln <h> W Scott Lincoln <p> I take my comment back. A simple search led to many news articles exactly as you describe. It is unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriotism everyone espouses, but also fear. Fear that will keep us bound and overpower our belief in the ideals supposedly so important to our country that makes the patriotism worthwhile. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> It is being reported all over because it is an outrage. You really should hire a lawyer, especially in light of the fact that it was only the two men who were under suspicion and you got taken in the kerfuffle. If it was the flight attendant who reported it, she or he needs to lose their job for being so scared of their passengers just for going to the restroom. This person is clearly in the wrong line of work. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> I 'm terribly sorry that you endured this. It 's unacceptable that so many people believe it 's OK to give up the rights this country was founded on to appease their irrational fears. The only thing I can offer you is my heartfelt thanks for sharing your experience in the hope that it will affect some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although this is horrible, think of it this way, it was n't Homeland Security that profiled, it was actually some paranoid passenger on the flight. You have to realize that people are going to be extra-extra paranoid especially on 9/11. Though you do have my sympathies that it happened to you, it should n't have happened. <h> Liz <p> " Extra-extra paranoid " is not an excuse. That you would even say something so disgusting as " you have to realize " clearly shows that you are comfortable with that paranoia resulting in the utter shattering of the rights that " patriots " allegedly hold so dear. <p> I am so very sorry this happened to you. Racial profiling is proven not to work. The tactics that " Homeland Security " are using do not work. What is happening instead is injustice in the name of ' supposed ' security. What they need to work on is building some trust and unity with other countries instead of scaring visitors and citizens. It 's totally disgusting how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported it as " suspicious " did n't think that two people from the same row go to the lavatory because they 're already up happens all the time!! If you have to get up to let someone out, you may as well go too so you do n't have to disturb the other passenger/s in the row again later. Fear has replaced common sense in many situations. The result is unfair treatment of innocent American citizens. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> It sounds like one was ill and gone for awhile, so the other got up to check on him. That is what papers are reporting. She stated she took photos of the commotion outside the plane with their camera because she was at a better angle, so it sounds like she had a window seat and the two Indian gentlemen were seated beside each other. <h> Kent <p> Is there not some kind of legal recourse to this? If the person did n't report anything actually specifically suspicious, just that they were " suspicious " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false arrest. <p> Not really. If you had to be ' accurate ' in every suspicion you had, that would have an extremely chilling effect on both professional law enforcement and citizen vigilance against( real) criminal activity. Probable cause is just that -- not nearly the same standard as ' beyond a reasonable doubt ', which is what is required for a conviction. <p> The TSA officials got a ' bad ' tip based on some racism and a lot of fear -- but if they had n't followed up and it HAD been something, we 'd be screaming just as loud. <h> AFC <p> There was no probable cause here, nor did the government claim to have probable cause. Instead, the government claimed that its searches were on the basis of protection. SCOTUS has ruled that police officers can search you WITHOUT probable cause, in order to ensure you do n't have weapons with which to attack them. <p> You are certainly totally incorrect, from a legal perspective, to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause. " <p> You write : " The TSA officials got a ' bad ' tip based on some racism and a lot of fear -- but if they had n't followed up and it HAD been something, we 'd be screaming just as loud. " <p> In my eyes, the fact that the plane landed safely at its destination without being hijacked, proves it was n't hijacked. <p> If you had to be ' accurate ' in every suspicion you had, that would have an extremely chilling effect on both professional law enforcement and citizen vigilance against( real) criminal activity. Probable cause is just that -- not nearly the same standard as ' beyond a reasonable doubt ', which is what is required for a conviction. <p> The standard for law enforcement is individualized suspicion based on an objective facts indicative of probable criminal activity. The " facts " reported to authorities were that two men each spent twenty minutes in the toilet, did not reply to someone speaking to them at the door, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her unfounded arrest, abduction, detention, search, and molestation. The power to do that is not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution. <h> moondancer <p> I ca n't believe some of you who can just dismiss it as a " little inconvenience ". Just read and think a little harder and imagine what it would be like if the same thing happened to you. You were handcuffed and carted off the plane while everybody looks at you like those who bombed the Twin Towers on 9/11. Forced to undress in front of a bunch of strangers and searched even in your body cavities( yes, your private parts). You were treated like the worst criminal on earth. You may be on FBI watch list for a long time after this( that means every time you apply for a job you 'll be question for it) Now, do you still think it as a " little inconvenience "?. That would scar me for the rest of my life. It 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while. That 's what mature adults do. <h> v <p> My comment was going to be exactly the same. It is SO IMPORTANT that you wrote this. I ca n't imagine for every person who writes or talks or tweets about an experience like this, how many must be shutting up! <p> Thank You and I will do my best to see this article is passed around in my part of the world. <h> Leslie <p> I am horrified and would like to use a whole bunch of expletives right now. Love your second to last line : " This country has operated for the last 10 years through fear. We 've been a country at war and going bankrupt for much of this time. " I 'd apologize for my " countrymen " - except, gee, they 're your countrymen as well. I hope we come to our senses one day and stop reacting to and through fear. <h> Margaret Helmick <p> Hey, 9/11-traveler, the nearly 3,000 people who were killed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever again. And you know what? Their " freedom " is gone FOREVER, and you complain about a few hours being detained. Where have you been for ten years? Wake Up : People who look like you DID THIS to innocent people. Get over yourself. And it sounds like you are actually PROUD your husband was able to smuggle a pocket knife on to an airplane after 9/11. <p> My husband is a tall dark Italian man, with a beard and mustache, and he is pulled aside and gets a " special search " every single time he has flown since 10/11/01, no matter what the date is. That 's the price we all pay now for what your fellow middle eastern countrymen did on 09/11/01. <p> Are the authorities truly supposed to ignore warnings and then take the blame later if something happens to you or your family? Are they mind readers? And apparently you also profile people by their appearance, I lost track of all of the disparaging descriptions you lauded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having " buzz " cuts and then continuing to rant about how you hate country music, speedboats, shitty beer can cozies, and rednecks you mentioned. Come on, now who 's racially profiling? And guess what, those same " fat belly " police men and women will be the very FIRST people you call when you need help... <h> squiddia <h> Glenda Hawthorne <p> It 's not even worth the time it takes to think of a response for people who have the mindset of Ms. Helmick. She is obviously bought into the whole " rule them by fear " mentality that was foisted onto the American people throughout the last decade. She is ruled by fear and hate. <h> Dash <h> e <p> Why would you even take the time to make a disgusting comment like this? What she was writing about here are that paranoia and hate are ALWAYS wrong, as is judging people by their appearance. Never at any point did she downplay the horrific events that occurred on that date 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how afraid she was when she thought that there was some sort of terrorist activity taking place on the plane -- completely unaware that the commotion was because of her and neighboring passengers. If you actually read/comprehended this eloquent, intelligent story, you would have gathered that. <p> She was not pulled aside and searched in line, she was removed from a plane by armed officers, placed in a cell and strip-searched because of the color of her skin. Also, for the record, she is an American, just like you. <h> Kate S <p> Are you intimating that she should " pay the price " of being strip searched and detained forcibly because of what she looks like? Really? Are you comparing the minor search your husband receives, and your resulting momentary inconvenience, to what she experienced? Are you aware that she, and others who have experienced this type of profiling, will now most likely have an FBI record for the rest of their lives due solely to having the audacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the clothing and general appearance of just about everyone involved in this incident, perhaps she was trying to set a scene and give details to bring the story to life for her readers. How dare a writer do such a thing. I applaud the rest of the people who managed to read your post and not comment, as I have no doubt you will remain safely in your hate filled little bubble of judgement and generalizations. I, for one, am sure I will regret engaging in such a juvenile squabble, but.... Post comment it is. <h> Bailey <h> SilenceDogood <h> Jan <p> I ca n't believe that you would write such an article merely because you were inconvenienced for a few hours. You were treated with kindness and respect by those officers. Those men and women put their lives on the line everyday to keep us all safe. Your aweful quips about their haircuts and beer bellies was disgusting. You have no idea how lucky you are to be an American. If the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well have been beaten and tortured. Lastly, you have some nerve comparing yourself to Malcome X. You are pathetic. <h> Allison <p> And if the same experience had happened on Mars, the situation would have been totally different! <p> That argument is really not a good one. It happened here, to an American who was detained for her appearance only. Just because she was " only " detained, strip searched, and interrogated, and not also raped and tortured does not make it right or acceptable. <h> Allison <h> Bailey <p> Hmmm... yes, things might have been different if she was in Saudi Arabia. But is n't that the point -- in America we have certain freedoms and rights and this woman was not only in America, but also an America citizen. So, I think your argument is pretty weak. <p> Just because an officer is nice, does not justify a baseless incarceration based on racial profiling and not suspicious actions. <h> SilenceDogood <p> Jan, I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice while they strip search someone does n't make it appropriate, or even noble, as you imply. <p> " Those men and women " do n't put their lives on the line, they drum up fear and ignorance in the name of 9/11 hysteria. <p> Let me ask you something, if you were around in the 1800? s, would you just have easily chastised a runaway slave for complaining of treatment because the nice officer who returned her to her master was so nice? After all, those were the rules! <h> Max <h> bigyaz <p> So just having skin of a different color is a good enough reason for someone to be cuffed, dragged off a plane and strip searched? In our America? No, that 's not acceptable. And you would n't think so either if they started targeting stupid white people. <h> GrammarPolice <h> Sarah <p> You were n't in the same situation as her. I 'd like to know what gives you the authority to say of someone else 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were treated with " kindness and respect "? You also ca n't speak on behalf of Saudi Arabia. Have you been there? What do you know or should I say what do you think you know that can be proven by people who live there? <p> I live in the same country as people like you? I 'm embarrassed. It 's comments like these that make me want to hide my US passport in a drawer out of shame. The next time I look at an American flag it wo n't be out of pride. I 'll be shaking my head in shame thinking of how the Internet runs rampant with ignorance such as yours. <h> Jen D <p> Jan, Shoshi never compared herself with Malcom X ; she drew from his example and decided to write about her experience. Regarding the " aweful( sic) quips " -- she was relating her feelings during the incident. I think Shosi has every idea of " how lucky( she) is to be an American. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world, from my point of view. <h> Chetan <p> You obviously did n't read the post. Dumping an innocent person in a cell and strip searching them( violating their constitutional rights, I might add) is being treated with respect? And the only thing you 're offended by is her talking about how she felt in the middle of it? <p> Yeah, it would have been worse in Saudi Arabia, but I 'd like to think the bar is a little higher over hear. <h> Sean Race <p> I really hope this is not a serious comment. But, please, please do not call upon the peaceful dead to further your obviously ignorant agenda. There is a major difference between mourning the dead and trying to prevent it happening again and obstructing others ' freedoms so that a bunch of fat, white middle class Americans can feel safe when they get on an airliner. <p> Her rights were violated, quite clearly, only because she happens to share the same skin color as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago. Hey, here 's an idea : Should we pull any poor or lower middle class white people aside because Timothy McVeigh blew up a government building in Okla. City? Or perhaps anyone of Irish heritage because they could possibly be in love with the ideology of the 60s-70s IRA. Would that make you feel safer? <h> Samantha <h> SilenceDogood <h> Markus <p> As a white, Catholic-baptised male, I ca n't remember the last time I was hassled at an Enterprise because " someone who looks like me " used a rental van to blow up a federal building. I use the McVeigh comparison all the time, myself, because it perfectly demonstrates how a white man killing Americans( even the guy who *flew a plane into the IRS building* a while back) is " a nutjob " while anyone who even looks Middle Eastern is an immediate suspect. <h> amanda <p> I agree with you Margaret, this gal is a racist who hates white people, yet moved to a white country because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's about this : We all segregate ourselves into nations based on what we look and act like. Then we we can trust those like us and not trust those who are different! Diversity is DIVISIVE! <h> GreenJello <p> Huh. I was molested by 3 WHITE people growing up. My father was physically abusive to me. He 's WHITE, too. My friend was raped by a WHITE male. Some WHITE teenagers broke into my garage and stole some things. <p> Yeah, segregation really helps us to be able to cut down on crime and feel safe with " our own kind ". Whatever. Low-life scum are in all races, all places on this earth. <h> Allison <h> Andrea <p> Um, Dan, this is not a white country. This country was built on the backs of black people, Chinese people, and Mexicans. The United States is the best damn place in the world because millions of immigrants and slaves generated its wealth and never benefited from their labor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean by " white. " Who is white? Who are your people? And how do white people act? <h> Markus <p> Is it ironic to chastise a brown-skinned woman for moving to a nation full of white people whose ancestors massacred a bunch of brown-skinned people who were already living there? Or just good old fashioned ignorant and racist? <h> Jess <h> Allison <p> I tend to hang out on sites that are pretty resistant to trolls. Given that Dan 's post was n't too far different from some of the other posts here in which the posters( as far as I can tell) were being absolutely dead serious, I do n't think we should be condemned that quickly. I have actually seen and read comments about diversity being dangerous that are pretty close to this post and that were heartfelt beliefs. <h> M <p> Wow, you 've really drunk the Kool-aid, have n't you, Margaret Helmick? We have rights in this country that were actually taken away by the USA Patriot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone else mentioned that this was not so much an issue of profiling but of bad profiling and I agree to a certain extent. If you think the author of this blog who had the grace &; eloquence to write about her traumatic experience deserves this treatment because she looks like the people who perpetrated 9/11( who, by the way, are not her countrymen ; Americans are her countrymen), then what about the two Indians sitting next to her? If you think Indians and Arabs look alike, you need to travel more. And hopefully, when you travel, you will not be treated badly for what your country( OUR country) has done to other countries. <h> Brent <p> So by your logic every time you drive a car, you should be pulled over because " people who look like you " bombed the federal building in Oaklahoma City " to innocent people. " Every time you get near a hospital, you should be stripped search because " people who look like you " have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to innocent people. " Every time you are near a school you should be detained because you may be the next Anders Breivick. And you should take this type of treatment with a big fat smile on your face. <p> What is worrisome is that this is the current state of our Homeland Security. Racial profiling is not only a travesty because it treats those arabs and those who look like arabs as second class citizens but it makes it easier for non arab looking individuals and groups to commit terrorism( ref Anders Breivick). <p> To Shoshana, I am horrified by your treatment and I am equally horrified by the ignorance some have displayed in you comments. Thank you for sharing your story. <p> Actually, you appalling troll, her " fellow countrymen? " That 's us. You and me. American citizens. You 're trying to paint her with the ugly brush because she looks different and you 've got baggage about what happened, because if you succeed, it 's okay to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her. If she 's guilty, my lily-white ass is too. And being as I 'd rather stand with her than with you, I think I can make my peace with that in short order. <h> Angi <p> A woman 's rights were violated for no good reason, and she reported feeling some non-charitable thoughts towards the people who were doing this to her, and the thing that offends you is that she was n't deferential enough IN HER OWN MIND to her white masters. <h> Liz <p> You are an idiot. The author is a US citizen. Period. The terrorists were not her " fellow middle eastern countrymen. " The author had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. And your husband has never, ever, been imprisoned and strip searched, so STFU. YOU should leave the US, because YOU are the anti-American -- as evidenced by your complete disdain of civil rights. <h> Chetan <p> Her fellow Mid Eastern countrymen? Margaret Helmick, your entire post is so full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdities in it. Some racist gets terrified because 3 dark brown people are in a row on an airplane and next thing they 've got fighter jets scrambled, a SWAT Team waiting and after all the BS, even the FBI admits people are seeing things that are n't there. I mean this post was buttugly stupid but that comment about her fellow MidEastern countrymen should get you some kind of redneck award for being dumb as a brick. <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> People who look like her got hauled off to death camps in Germany, too. 18% of the people who died on 9/11 look like her. She is half Jewish. Jews were targets of the 9/11 attack. Are you going to blame her for that? <p> Her description of people was her showing irony due to her being profiled for her looks. <h> DW <p> Whoa. You 're fellow middle eastern countrymen? Please! I highly doubt that whoever you are referring to in this post associates themeslves with the radicals that started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm as white as white can be, born and raised in the US. I 'm well educated, God fearing, care about my manners, respect the law, and expect the law to respect me. I travel with my family, on business, and with friends on vacation about 20 times a year. And every time I travel I get frisked. Every single flipping time! I 'm 6 ' 2?, 250lbs, brown hair, brown eyes, no tats, one wedding ring, no record( well, I got a speeding ticket once), have n't traveled out of the US since 9/11. I ca n't even get a dark tan and pretend to be a different race! I hate beer coozies, and mean readnecks -- or maybe it 's just mean people in general I hate. <p> I grew up the minority and was racially profiled for being white. In my teen 's and 20? s I lost jobs to Hispanics and African Americans. I was turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point blank, this is a job for a Mexican not you. So suffice it to say that I get what this feels -- and looks like. And if you 've never been on that end of the stick, you too( yes, even you who are married to a tall Italian) will never understand what it means to be pushed aside and/or singled out simply because of your skin. It sucks. It 's maddening. It makes you say things about people who are abusing you that boggle even your own educated mind. <p> this is a direct result of american capitulation to fear and terror after the attacks. from the top( W. and Cheney) down we have failed to learn anything of significance ; the aftermath should have been handled better. sorry for the horrors inflicted on you and those with you on your flight. <h> Lauren <p> I 'm so angry on your behalf. I recently re-listened to a radio show, This American Life, which detailed the bullying and abuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show is available to listen to for free here : http : **35;6068;TOOLONG.... I 'd highly recommend it, for the original author of this post and for anyone commenting on it. What you read here is NOT an isolated incident because of the particular date. It is part of a long history of discrimination and disrespect on the part of most Americans towards Arab people, or people who look like them may be of Arab descent. <p> Nicholas Kristof posted a link to this on FB ; you do n't know me, but I am glad he did because this post affected me profoundly. <p> I am American-born and Caucasian, and happen to be on a layover on an international flight. I was able to go through a TSA scanner with my dignity intact and even joked about Yankees v. Mets with the TSA agent as he was processing me. I also could make the mistake of not taking my keys out of my pocket and be corrected for it, without feeling like I was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I fully realized how lucky I am. I never thought I *deserved* this treatment, it just did n't occur to me how real and how different the reality was. <p> So thank you for raising my awareness. I may also blog about this once I reach my destination( do n't want to jinx myself while at the airport, bashing the security state!). I did want to thank you for your experience. Not for going through it but for having the courage to share it, you know? <h> Liz <p> I 've been subjected to breast fondling even after the nekkid picture, because the Rhodes scholar who read my x-ray apparently had never seen an underwire bra. So the nice TSA lady felt me up. Guilty until proven innocent, that 's the American Way. <h> SilenceDogood <p> After reading this I ca n't think of the words strong enough to tell you how sorry I am that this happened to you. The burden of 9/11 has fallen so heavy on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing this... I will share it. <h> FlickDude <p> You absolutely MUST look to pursue this legally. From your description, your rights as a US citizen have most definitely been violated, as has your body. On absolutely no grounds other than a report from a clueless, fear-mongered fool. <p> Please, do not stop here. This level of xenophobia is inexcusable. We have to stop. The government has to stop before people begin to beat people in the streets for simply being " brown ". <p> My heart is broken for you. Thank you for having the guts to tell the story, and please do n't stop there. I have shared this as well via Twitter. <p> I am so very glad to hear this. I am only a paralegal, but as I read( and cried) through your account, I mentally ticked off violations of law and basic constitutional rights and could only hope you would seek further counsel. <p> Like 99.9% of the other posters, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone else. I am simply stunned, appalled, nauseated, and angry that our country has turned into this police state. See something, say something has become nothing more than state-sanctioned racisim and terrorism and only the innocent have been caught up in this horrible dragnet. Soon, it wo n't even be racism -- anyone, no matter what the skin color, who disagrees or speaks up against the fear machine will soon find themselves undergoing a cavity search, too. <p> Thank you so very much for having the fortitude to write this up and post it. I 'm glad you have a support system in place as you process this experience and deal with the more-than-likely fallout. I sincerely hope that this helps bring awareness of how far we 've fallen and I 'll post this link on my FB( in addition to Twitter, etc.) to get the message out there. <p> I am so very glad to hear this. I am only a paralegal, but as I read( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations of law and basic constitutional rights and could only hope you would seek further counsel.

I believe that this is exactly the sort of situation that could finally lead to a SCOTUS review of the horrors that are being inflicted upon innocent citizens that are in complete violation of the Fourth Amendment. This ca n't go unchallenged. <h> Michelle <p> One of my friends posted this on Facebook, and I followed the link. This is awful! I hope nothing like this ever happens to you again. It 's unfair that it happened to begin with. The person who reported you is clearly pretty small minded and racist. Paranoia does n't excuse that sort of behavior. I 'll share this on my Facebook, too, to get stories like this out! <p> Thanks for sharing this story... I saw it on Mark Armstrong 's FB feed and was horrified reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; I feel like the only way these things have a chance of stopping is to share real stories. So glad you are safe. <h> Mo <p> This is crazy Shoshi! Justin and I read a news report last night after we saw your 3 tweets to see what had happened. All we saw was that 2 men and 1 woman were detained. I ca n't believe that was you! I 'm happy to hear that you 're safe and home again, and I 'm so happy that the boys were n't with you. Stil in awe... <h> James <p> Thanks for so eloquently sharing your written account. This made my experience with the government tame by comparison, but I still feel violated all over again by reading this. I can sadly tell you that it 's not just darker-skinned folks who get this treatment, it 's anyone and everyone they choose. I have shared your story and hope that others will share their accounts. I am truly ashamed of the legacy our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... I 'm not sure I would have been able to stay calm. I 've always refused to believe that I might one day be a racial profiling victim. As I travel through the US and Europe, I am mostly not concerned about being singled-out. I guess I 've convinced myself that somehow I would get treated like any average N American. I even refused to acknowledge the fact that the only reason I was n't able to check-in and print my boarding pass online or at the airport was simply because I was born in Arab country. On my way to LA, I was informed that I was " randomly " chosen to pass extra security. It might be random, but now I know that if I was Kate Jones from Maryland, married to Jeff Williams, I would have been able to check-in online. I 'm so glad that you wrote this blog and that it is being shared on FB and Twitter. Maybe your story and others like it will help change this obviously flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jumpy nature that all of the media 's cries of " potential 9/11 terror threats " instilled in us. I do. But what you suffered because of your ethnicity I find unforgivable, appalling, shameful. George Carlin once said that airport security exists solely to make white people feel safe. We need to guard our airports, sure... but we need to guard them from terrorism, not from People Who Look Like They Might Be From the Middle East, God Forbid. <p> You are an amazing individual for handling this disgrace with as much dignity as you have showed. I 'll be sharing your story and conveying my admiration. <p> A report of " suspicious behavior???? " Good thing some anonymous tipster did n't denounce you as a witch. What, we 're going to have SWAT teams deploy now every time somebody farts during the national anthem? Land of the brave, indeed. <h> dan <p> While I 'm sorry you had to go through with this ordeal, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone had correctly reported the suspicious behavior of the 9/11 hijackers that day, history might have been quite different. Nobody that reported you knew you, or had anything against you personally. Yes it is unfair, but when people are bent on destruction and will kill planeloads of innocent civilians without thinking twice, not everything can be fair. <p> I think the officials involved treated you more than reasonably, given the situation, and your only beef should be with the trigger-happy person that reported you. Taking the incident beyond that seems like a stretch. <h> ER <p> So Dan, what was it exactly that SHE did that caused someone to report " suspicious behavior? " Oh, that 's right, she sat next to two other dark-skinned individuals. On the anniversary of 9/11. Now that 's suspicious! <h> Liz <p> WHAT??!!! Treated her " reasonably "??!! Are you insane??!! She was stripped and cavity searched!!! What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!! Please get the hell out of the US and leave it to people who TRULY value our FREEDOM, not just our safety. <h> Jess <p> The " authorities " were informed numerous times of the actually-suspicious behavior of most of the 9/11 bastards. If you believe the state enforcement apparatus exists to protect the average citizen, I have a bridge I 'd like to sell you, real cheap. <p> It is n't clear that there was actually a suspicious passenger. They certainly have n't produced one. <h> Jay <p> -You are of a ethnic group that is known to be " racially profiled " because of 9-11. -You chose to fly on 9-11, and sit alongside others of suspicious ethnic groups. -You were " racially profiled " because people of your ethnic group blew up almost 3,000 of our people, people that never even heard of Osama bin Laden before. -You then proceed to complain about a violation of your " civil rights " when in fact, none of them were violated. Ever travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did pale in comparison, and they have the safest flights in the world. <p> So you purposefully chose to fly on 9-11, knowing the atmosphere in our great country being how it is, and ESPECIALLY on this day when we were attacked by the likes of your people and you dare to complain about the measures put in place to guard us from the likes of you? Please. <p> You have NO room to complain, and I, for one, am glad that I chose to report you and the likes of you. I had a safe flight, content in the knowledge that I did n't have to watch that section out of the corner of my eye the whole flight, and wondering if this would be the last flight I ever took. You deserved exactly what you got, you sympathizer, and if you do n't like what we are doing here to keep US safe, then go back home. <h> Bailey <p> Incredibly un-American comments here. A " real " American appreciates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses, especially when that person is a law-abiding citizen. A " real " American does not judge an entire ethnic group comprised of millions of people based on the actions of a few.( By your logic, all Americans should be judged on the actions of Timothy McVeigh, Eric Rudulph, or the Unibomber?) A " real " American does not tell a fellow American citizen to " go back home. " <p> Also, for the record, I do n't know how she " chose " to sit next to " others of suspicious ethnic groups " given that the seating decision is determined by the airline. And since when are Indians a " suspicious ethnic group "? India is a huge ally of the United States and Indians were not involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. <p> What I object to is the notion that " her " ethnic group killed 3,000 of " our " people. So no people of Arab or Jewish descent were innocent victims of the terrorists on 9/11? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes, Bailey. 100% And it 's the ignorant, hate mongers like Jay who killed a Sikh after 9-11 in Phoenix, a hard working gas station owner making a contribution in the community. They killed him in retribution to 9-11, in their complete supidity, apparently thinking a Sikh would be a buddy of Osama Bin Laden. I speak Arabic &; Spanish. If everyone spoke 3-4 languages, maybe we would not be so tribal and backward in this country. <h> Summer <p> You do n't deserve to be an American citizen. You 're a nasty, selfish, ignorant bastard who enjoys that privilege by an unfortunate accident of birth. I would trade 1,000 of you for one Shoshanna, but not before I punched you in the face repeatedly for my own satisfaction. I hope you are as miserable and unloved as you sound, and I hope you stay that way for the rest of your disgusting, worthless little life. I am ashamed to share this planet with you and anyone you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather die than see my America overtaken by " the likes of you. " <h> Concerned US Citizen <p> Well, while he is what you said, violence is part of the problem. Part of the privilege of being an American is freedom of speech. I do n't like what he said either, but I hope he becomes less miserable to be around. <p> I am a " real USA citizen " just like you Jay and I am disgusted by the behavior and sentiment you are exhibiting here to another " real USA citizen " as she practices her right to free speech after an unreasonable search and seizure which is a clear violation of her rights as a " real USA citizen. " <p> She has every right to complain, just like you have every right to share your racist, xenophobic comments. She was traveling in the U.S. as a U.S. citizen. This did not take place in 1984 by Orwell and this did not take place in 1960? s U.S.S.R. This happened in American, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M <p> " real " USA citizen : You redneck idiot. It 's people like you that welcomed the Nazis in in Germany. Are you really saying that because she looked vaguely arabic she should have forgone her right to fly, as a free American citizen, on any given day she chose to? Are you truly suggesting that she should downgrade herself because of the fears of what people like you hold? America is in the grip of fear, and fear makes you weak... your weakness disgusts me. <h> Jeremy Shapiro <p> Well I thought this blog post was the most sickening thing I 'd read today, and then I read Jay 's response. I feel so lucky -- so incredibly lucky -- that I won the skin pigment lottery and thus am not the target of filth like him in my own country. Just gross, gross and sad. <p> To the author, for what it 's worth I asked a trial lawyer friend of mine about your experience, and he had this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a witch 's brew of national security, terry stops, FAA regs, and her consent. I think if she had stopped talking and asked for a lawyer things may have been interesting. Which is n't to say she still does n't have a claim, but I 'm simply not as knowledgeable as I 'd like to be for these situations. Her tacit engagement( sadly) does n't help her case, but at the same time there are limits. I 'd be happy to take it to court anyway and make them prove their case. " <h> mike <p> Hey Co*k S*cker -- get your facts right, it is people of your color who did 9/11 -- used a bunch of sand n*ggers to execute it -- so that they can get slaves like you buy into their elitist agenda of plundering the wealth of the nation and feed their greedy military industrial complex buddies -- banker and the likes. You moron, today its some sand n*gger, tomorrow its us. Think you are safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retardation viruses( maybe also done that in your case), fed genetically modified cow dung, and told you are living a free and happy life -- which you will most like believe. <p> I 'm sorry you had to go through the humiliating and terrifying experience with the DHS, and I 'm even more sorry that small-minded bigots are now bashing you, here on your own blog, for speaking out against the violations of your rights. <h> M &M; <p> AMEN.......( as we say in the US!) to Jay who commented on 9/12 @ 9:07pm. For those of you who are so sad that this happened to these people on this flight where the hell were you 10 years ago on 9/11. Have you forgotten the pit inside you? Maybe you had no feeling of sorrow for our country that day or the people who we lost. Talk about UN-AMERICAN! Thanks to the FBI and the crew members and the Air force who were doing their jobs at keeping those on that flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You were born of the ethnic group that is " profiled " in this the GREAT country. Why would you choose to fly on 9/11? I feel sorry and sad that you had to go through what you went through, however.... yes there are many Americans who will be on guard FOREVER because of 9/11. Sorry you are of the " ethnic group " that we are on guard from. Would n't it be nice to say we trust everyone again? Do n't get this guy Jay wrong, I am sure there have been times when he has wondered if he were safe around some of the White Trash Americans too! However just a little advice in case you have n't learned. If you do n't want to be profiled there are 364 other days a year you could fly and not have people freaked. <p> Un- American to be like this? No..... there are many of us who have had fear put into us forever. Say it " they win we lose "? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't let our guard down anymore! If I recall right how many chants have been given by this " ethnic group " " DEATH TO AMERICA? " We have a right to be on high alert all days of the year but a stronger right on 9/11! <p> Good luck to you I truly hope that you have a great life and recover from your 9/11/2011 experience. You sound like a nice lady but I also hope you have a better understanding that many Americans are not over what happen 10 yrs ago and we NEVER will be. It is n't that we are " being racial ". We are being SMART! And the next time we are high jacked or held hostage by anyone of the group the USA " profiles " and we stop and attack what will the feelings be then? Gratefulness! <h> Allison <p> God bless a USA that does n't violate the Constitutional rights of its citizens because of their skin color. <p> God bless a USA that does n't allow unsubstantiated reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violation of Constitutional rights. <p> God bless a USA in which people recognize that being of a particular ethnic group does not automatically equate to being a terrorist. <p> God bless a USA In which people are not racially profiled based on nothing of their behavior but everything of their skin color, and can fly on any goddamn day they please, because they have that freedom. <h> Ian <p> I remember the pit inside me, yes. I remember that I though, " Shit. People are going to use this to push through crazy fascist laws. There goes my freedom. " <p> I was never afraid for my life. And my life was never in danger. I was afraid for my freedoms. And those have been taken from me. By people who always wanted to take those from me, because the American people, who used to prize freedom, allowed themselves to be scared into giving them up. <p> And now you 're DEFENDING your own cowardice? Saying that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared? <p> Bravery involves doing the right thing. Cowardice leads to evil. Which side are you on? <h> Liz <p> So, as a US citizen of Arab descent, she has no right to travel, right? And because the airline decided where she would sit( she did n't know the other guys, so how, exactly, did she " choose " to sit with them?), she is at fault for the fact that her seatmates were also of Arab descent, right? And being imprisoned and strip-searched is what she deserved as a descendant of a Middle Eastern lineage, right? Even though she is a US citizen and her HOME is in Ohio( that 's a state in the US, by the way, in case you did n't know). How about YOU leave the country, since you do n't care about the freedoms upon which this once great nation was founded? Go found another Nazi or Fascist country. You 'll feel right at home. Cretin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hatred. Hatred that a VERY SMALL GROUP of a certain nationality had for a country. Hatred that ran so deep that it did n't matter to them that the specific people they murdered in their acts were just random citizens, and not THE people they held hatred for. <p> They decimated people, and they decimated buildings that were the heart of America. And in the process, hatred created hatred. <p> Jay, your post is a prime example of this. I disagree that, due to her skin, her appearance, her ancestry, that Shebshi should have stayed home. I disagree that she should have known. I disagree that she should have to guard her every move, because someone else has let fear breed hatred and prejudice against her just because she is not white. <p> One of the things that North America should pride itself on most is openness, a melting pot society where EVERYONE is equal. We are not " Animal Farm "( Orwell). We should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men being MORE equal than others. That is bullshit, and it is shameful. <p> On September 11, 2001, I watched the footage unfold on my television, with a pit in my stomach so heavy it was indescribable. Ten years later, as the footage was re-played, I felt the same pit, with the same intensity. Today, reading this, it 's increased... I did n't think the feeling could get any worse. <p> If we allow this hatred to infiltrate our lives, then all the people whose lives were lost, all the emergency response personnel who sacrificed theirs, underneath piles of steel that crumbled under the hatred of those select few, ALL OF IT will be for naught. And we ourselves will continue to create victims of this tragedy, by our own actions. <p> The thought makes me ill. <p> Shebshi, I do n't know you, but I 'm so very sorry you went through this, and unbelievably grateful that you had the strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no legal recourse for you, that perhaps in the sharing of your experience and the spreading of this story, perhaps there will be a way to lobby for change. <p> Everyone needs to step away from the hatred, else we will never be safe, and the danger will not only be from the outside, but also from within. 9/11 NEVER should have happened. But it did. So now, it 's up to us to make sure it was n't in vain. <h> Marty <p> I do not men to diminish your reply, as I agree with you and it seems very thought out and intelligent, but you are misusing the word decimated( which means to destroy one tenth of something, as the prefix suggests, and has also been adapted more recently to mean destroy a large percentage of). Perhaps obliterated would have been a better fit here. Your point was not lost though, I 'm just kind of a jerk sometimes. Sorry. <h> bglick <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to. I am so so so sorry for what happened to you. I 'm severely opposed to the Patriot Act( I understand the underlying point, but I 'm still opposed) and all the fear mongering that has gone on in this damn country the last 10 years. I do n't understand how we went from banding together immediately after 9/11 happened to now picking up anyone with a slight tan and throwing them in a cell for however long we deem necessary. It 's disgusting how our freedoms and rights are slowly being consumed in the name of protection, and we are forced into giving up these freedoms without question, too stunned to even begin to figure out how to fight back. <p> Something needs to change. We ca n't go on like this, locking every person up that looks different. Eventually we 'll all be put in jail. <p> This is a disgusting display, Shoshana. I am glad you were able to recount it in so much detail. <p> As a Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of work or a very specific visit that I ca n't avoid. These are the stories that make me wonder about what could happen to me, those I 'm travelling with or the innocent people around me. Destroying individuals ' freedoms, even for a few hours, is entirely unacceptable -- especially in a country where every newscast or interview with the general public includes a reference to " freedom " -- whatever that is these days. <h> AR <p> Do you really think Canadian Officials are less racists? In Dec 2009, when I drove from NJ to Montreal. I was detained and harassed for a few hours by Canadian immigration. I was asked choice questions, such as, " Why are you single? " " Why do you have a laptop in your car? " " Why do you have $200 in your wallet? " " Why did you book a hotel in Montreal only 4 days before your trip? " <p> Of course, on the way back, I was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't carry another South Asian passport. I told them that the only passport I need is US Passport, which I was carrying. <p> I 'm really sorry this happened to you. Were you not able to ask for a lawyer? I was n't aware that ANYONE could force you to do a strip search. This seems like it was a violation of your 4th Amendment right. You may want to contact the local ACLU about this. They may be able to give you more details, but I feel you were unlawfully searched. I do n't study law nor do I know anything beyond what the 4th Amendment says but a strip search seems " unreasonable ". <h> lawmule <p> There is nothing in the Patriot Act that allows this type of unreasonable warrantless search performed without probable cause. Even a " Terry stop " temporary detention only allows a frisk( patdown of outer garments) IF an officer harbors reasonable suspicion that a person is ARMED. Fear &; profiling do not = reasonable articulable suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post left me in tears, and angrier than ever at all the ways 9/11 has been twisted into a convenient vehicle for people 's blind ignorance and fear. I do agree with Paul 's comment( above) that airport security needs to be run by professionals, and ignorant people( as the person obviously was who " reported " you) should not be allowed to run the show. I am going to repost this. Meanwhile, i hope you do find out who " reported " you -- i would like to see them hauled in for questioning themselves. And all those officers who were doing their " duty " -- at what point do they stop following orders and see for themselves what is really going on? <p> You 're a better person than I. I would have told them if they are n't arresting me, they 'd better release me and not answered any of their questions. If they asked to see my Facebook or Twitter, they would have heard some foul language explaining to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizen that thinks this is justifiable, I 'll call you a coward to your face. Liberty comes with a cost, and that cost is that you 're not safe. Safety is an illusion anyway and totally contrary to liberty. <p> I 'm truly glad I served 8 years so my fellow citizens could just throw it all away. /sarcasm <h> Crystal <p> Sad to know about your experience.Is n't it disturbing how even common people have started to stereotype people on the basis of their race and appearance? Somewhere, development of this philosophy has to do with government 's actions, policies and behaviour.Even if cops are reported about any such suspicious behaviour, they need to be easy with people and behave in a better manner.And I really think we need to have officials who can actually judge the body language of a person.They did not have the right to treat you this way, right?. WRONG.They actually did, thanks to the policies of the government.What a shame. <h> Rich <p> Hind site is twenty twenty, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU were placed under arrest without any probable cause they committed multiple crimes against you and you should be naming names and in the process of suing them AND do not settle. <p> Dear Shebshi, I 'm an airline captain. I pilot a B-737 for a major air carrier based in the United States. On behalf of my colleagues in the profession, I apologize for what happened to you. I would have been furious if any member of my family had been treated like that. My company trains us to judge passengers according to the way they behave, not the way they look. <p> I have not heard the other sides of the story, so I will reserve my condemnation of anyone else until I get all of the facts. However, I 'll say this : If things transpired exactly as you described, this would not have been enough to cause me to report you or your fellow passengers as a security threat. I hope that, as time passes, you 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and anyone else who " looks different " unjustified discomfort. Please trust us again to safely transport you and your family. <h> Jeff Larson <p> Mr. Nelson, the finest compliment I can pay you is that if more people had the common sense, courtesy, and decency that you exhibited in that post, Shoshona would have never had to suffer the mistreatment that she endured, and neither of us would have visited her blog today. May all your skies be CAVU. <p> Your ability to write this report under your despicable circumstances is to be admired. We must work together all of us and continue to be vocal about the way we are handling " security " in the United States. It is not just and it does not make sense. <p> shebshi : i told myself that i would avoid my friends political posts this month because of the despair it causes me. the futility of feeling and knowing i can do nothing about my own dismal personal situation, and even less about what is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. i have especially studiously avoided all 9/11 remembrance propoganda, because, as our guest pastor pointed out, how much is remembrance and how much is ratings. as my first born is getting married in eleven days, i would like to harness what little spiritual and psychic energy i have, in her direction. but i will repost this blog which was shared by nicholas kristoff. and i will ask my friends to share this also. i, too, have had a run-in with d.h.s. at that point, i felt they had nothing better to do than to harrass a middle aged, high school instructional assistant. i was right. i 'm sorry they put you and the two gentleman through this horrendous experience. " People willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both. "( attributed to benjamin franklin) GOD bless. <p> As far as I am aware all these extra security precautions have n't resulted in stopping a single terrorist action. The TSA, et. al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk-up how these security procedures have increased safety yet, they have n't done so. <p> The terrorists have won. The USA( and the rest of the western-world) has reduced personal liberty in so many situations, the worst demonstrable being air-travel. This must exceed any expectations they had for the actions of 9/11. <p> There is no reasonably way back from this. Governments, who seize extra power, rarely return it when that power is no longer required. With everything happening in 2011, it is easy to see the end of the world as we 've known it for the past 60 years. <h> aud <p> thank you so much for sharing your story. i, like many others, read the AP stories but you have truly brought the " reaction " to life for us. you are a much more tolerant woman that i, i would 've been flinging f-bombs right and left, loudly. i believe it was Paul who posted about my feelings on the subject -- this theatre we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their trained professionals as i have a family member who works for the TSA. <p> glad you are safe, and i hope you, and all of us, can enjoy traveling again someday... <p> Yuvi, you 're wise not to come to the US. I 've urged my friends overseas not to come either. This country has turned into a pool of hysteria and paranoia, with the complicity of millions of so-called citizens. <p> I am so sorry this happened to you. I am sorry my beautiful country has been taken over by profiteering thugs who have manipulated us into exactly what " the terrorists " want. I am also ashamed at my countrymen who would allow this to happen here and walk like sheep, undeserving of the benefits of true men and women of courage and conviction who did their best to form a government of freedom. <p> Please see my post Faithful To Thee, America, In Our Fashion. I will continue to speak of these matters irregardless of the consequences because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good citizen. <p> I am glad to know people like you understand this also. Thank you so much for posting. <h> Jenny Baker <p> I think your major conclusion is right, fear drives so much of what we do. The question becomes, is fear ever a good motivator? By itself, I 'd say no. You were the victim of a fear-based society which only brings oppression and never freedom. I 'm so sorry you had to experience this. I can imagine how hard it is to process this experience. However, the strength with which you handled yourself is truly remarkable. I hope for a full healing and restoration of your soul. <p> I 'm very sorry you experienced this, and I do find it terrible. BUT, calling people " fat Jada Pinkett Smith ", " white middle aged cop " ' and generalizing hate against speedboats and country music makes your claims about what you believe in quite laughable. You had a chance to make a very powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick <h> M <h> f. <p> Since when are people expected to be inhumanly graceful and kind while being detained and strip-searched for absolutely no reason? Something tells me you 'd have a few uncharitable thoughts in that situation as well. <h> Online <h> pete.d <p> Are you suggesting the officer did not look like Jada Pinkett Smith, or that she was not fat? Or that the other cop in question was not white, or that he was not middle-aged? On what basis do you make those claims? <p> As far as the question of hating " speedboats and country music ", it seems to me that those passages in her post do a very effective job of helping us understand the psychological state she was suffering under. Fact is, on the whole there are n't a whole lot of people involved in the " speedboat and country music " culture who are arguing for better protections of civil rights, but even if you think it 's not a fair generalization, the point is to bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively. <h> Jess <p> If the author had described a fat white woman as a " fat Celine Dion ", would that have been inherently racist? Of course not. All black women do not look alike. This particular black woman looks like Jada Pinkett Smith, except she is fat. In describing her in that fashion, the author is n't drawing any particular attention to her race. <p> It is actually your racism that causes you to interpret any reference to a black celebrity as racism. <h> pete.d <p> Ignoring for a moment that the " frog in warming water " story is a myth, remaining a citizen and resident of the USA is no evidence of being metaphorically equivalent to said frog. <p> The frog does not have the option of adjusting the temperature of the pot to suit. A responsible American citizen absolutely does, and in fact that 's exactly what the author of this blog article is doing. Leaving the country does nothing to help the country, and in fact if every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left, no one would remain to help the country heal itself. <p> She is doing her part to publicize the heinous injustices perpetrated on travelers in the US, and to make an effort to rectify the situation. What are you doing? <h> Philip <p> Unbelievable. I found your link on Nicholas Kristof 's facebook acct. Thanks for sharing, and you nor anyone deserves to be singled out for the color of their skin or their attire. And I also appreciated the fact that the only true criminal in this case was the pudgy middle aged white guy. Much love and remember that the vast majority of our country does n't think the way that the person who reported the three of you, does. I blame the stupid patriot act, the media for perpetuating gross stereotypes, and our crap educational system that does n't enable a lot of us to garner analytical thinking. Once again, sorry this happened to you and as a fellow American, I apologize. <h> Gulliver <h> Tamra Mosher <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please know that I, a complete stranger who lost family in 9/11, APOLOGIZE for the way you were treated. Your story shows just how far we have devolved as a country, and as humans in the past 10 years. I hope you are doing alright, and I applaud you for the grace in which you dealt with this situation and for sharing your story with everyone. Shalom. <h> Samia <p> So sorry you had to go through this. I also flew on 9/12/2011. I am home now, but as I read this to my husband, I told him this very well could have been me. I am sharing this on my FaceBook page. My daughters go through similar things when they fly as well. It is not only the color of the skin, it is what you where and what your name sounds like or looks like. It is truly, truly sad and scary. Thank you for sharing. <h> Batya L. Wittenberg <p> I 'm a Jewish Orthodox woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been " randomly " picked out of airport security lines for an extra search.( Funny, it only ever seems to happen when I 've covered my hair with a scarf instead of a hat....) I 've never been subjected to the kind of violation you describe, but every so often it 's brought home to me how easily I could be. <p> I am so, so sorry this happened to you. And I echo the sentiments of those above who have urged you to take legal action if possible. This ca n't be allowed to continue. <h> Ryan <p> Thanks for sharing your story, and I sympathize with your situation, which undoubtedly turned out to be nothing more than racial profiling. However, I 'm curious about something. What would you recommend the FBI do in this situation? If a report is called in, mid flight, regarding suspicious activity, can you think of the " right " thing to do? As a Caucasian, I 'll be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in your shoes, but I understand your anger, frustration, and humiliation... I 'm just not sure I understand how this situation could have been handled in a more appropriate manner by the FBI, given the( mis) information they were given. <p> The FBI could have reviewed the source of the information and done further checking. <p> For example, just recently in AZ a woman was accused by a police informant of being a drug dealer. They obtained a warrant( something that did n't happen here) and she was brought to the hospital for a forced cavity search( all cavities). The hospital sent her a bill. Nothing was found by the way. It appears police informants may lie occasionally. <p> In this case, this is probably on par of " people not like me are visiting the bathroom, and look at the lady with them. " This is on par with the airplane stewardess who reported a musician reading a book about WW2 aircraft. He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched. <p> I did not hear anything in this account of being read her rights, being put under arrest, being told the charges she was being held for, or any description of the alleged activities that may have justified a strip search. This discounts the request for private information and other parts of the story( as told here) that basically put this into the 3rd world country category of " pick up a citizen, put them in a jail cell, do n't give them any rights, and harass them to your heart 's content " which is what banana republics do. <h> Ryan <p> Okay, so the FBI does some checking. They find out the accuser is Susie Q. Homemaker with nothing to note on her record. They research the accused and find out one is a US Citizen, one is an Indian Immigrant, the other, who knows. None have a criminal past. Does that mean the threat is neutralized? Then what? " Okay, threat averted, no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just playing Devil 's advocate here, of course, but there is only so much passive investigation that can be done from a desk in Langley. <h> pete.d <p> So? The answer is that you do n't make a judgment from a desk in Langley to drag a person off a plane in handcuffs. <p> Someone had a suspicion, based on something. That person is the first point of contact for law enforcement, those officers on site. They listen to whatever witness account that person has to share, and then based on a description of a specific behavior that the witness felt was suspicious, they either act or they do n't. <p> A chain of information led to the baseless arrests of these individuals. Either the law enforcement agents overreacted to insufficient basis, or a witness was lying about what they actually witnessed. There needs to be an investigation to determine at what point the people arrested were falsely accused, and the responsible parties need to be punished. <p> A vague sense that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being dragged off a plane in handcuffs, never mind all the things that happened subsequent to that! <h> Liz <p> Ryan, the FBI could have let her go once they found out that she is a US citizen and she passed through TSA when boarding the plane, and perhaps done a background check on her while she was still in the air. There simply was no reason whatsoever for their actions. There was no threat, and any human being with two brain cells to rub together, let alone allegedly highly trained security professionals, would have been able to figure it out. <h> Rebecca Ore <p> I live in Nicaragua as a resident alien. Nicaragua does grow bananas, but has n't been a banana republic in the political sense since 1979. I 'm not sure the US is n't more of a banana republic in that sense than Nicaragua, Costa Rica, or Panama. <p> This incident was pretty wretched. The US sells itself as promoting democracy( neo-liberalism is what they really promote) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> pocketlama <p> I know you mean well and I 'm not attacking but I really do n't think it 's her responsibility to come up with something else law-enforcement should have done. That 's their job. <p> From my perspective, I have a comment on that. They regularly turn planes around or land at a near-by airport for " threats " or unruly passengers. The police then do an actual investigation and do n't do a full-on SWAT invasion of the plane. In the course of that investigation they would have figured out that Ms. Hebshi was only " guilty " of being in the same row as a sick man and let her go much sooner. <h> Brian <p> Racial profiling is totally within the law, and if you do n't believe that, you are ignorant. I do not have a problem AT ALL with what happened. Plus, I 'll bet that other things happened that were n't reported either. Good job FBI. I would n't want that job. Every time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> OK, Brian, then let 's get you thrown into a prison cell and strip-searched right then and there without any cause and without any discussion. Since you 're so OK with it happening to her, you 'll be just fine with it happening to you, right? Because what happened to her is no different from it happening to you just because I do n't like you. <h> s. <p> Ryan, " handled in a more appropriate manner "?? Are you kidding?? You think handcuffing, detaining, jailing, and detaining people is an " appropriate manner "?? Do you realize we have( or had) this thing called the Bill of Rights in this country? <p> I 'm willing to bet that the lady would n't have overly complained if this story had n't involved getting handcuffed, forced to hold her bladder for hours, being shoved in a filthy cell, and being strip-searched, and( oh, yeah!) having a little racist comment snarked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's security, and there 's security theater, and then there 's " we 're going to publicly humiliate you and act with no regard for your humanity. " <p> We are starting to work with Michigan legislators, and since this happened in Detroit, if you so choose, you can help fight the illegal and abusive practices. <p> PERSONAL ADVICE : I recommend you contact a lawyer. Your background is interesting -- from an Arab perspective, CAIR works closely to protect Islamic rights, and I imagine the ADL might help from a Jewish perspective. <p> More importantly, independent of ethnicity, a US Citizen has rights. In our examination of 4th Amendment background law concerning strip searches, your rights may have been violated. There are lots of grey areas, although most courts believe suspects need to be under arrest or in jail to be strip searched. From your account, it seems you were not under arrest. <p> We would look forward to having a discussion with you, if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you, and thanks for sharing your story. People need to know when this sort of thing happens -- not just the " facts " reported by AP, but the human side. Although yesterday was a solemn day of remembrance for those who lost loved ones 10 yrs ago, for the rest of us the media frenzy yesterday simply fueled this kind of xenophobic, paranoid hysteria. Ten years later, and we still have learned nothing. The Forever War, and the attitudes that fuel it, needs to end. <h> Mona <p> I am so, so glad you wrote about this experience, and so eloquently too. This incident that happened to you is like all of our unspoken fears come to life, for my husband and myself. We 're both of Indian origin ; he grew up in North America. He 's got a beard( as do many professors) but that 's the worst thing for profiling. He shaved it for the first time in his life on 9/12/01 but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we are at the end of the day, and should n't. Like you, I would have taken the pragmatic approach to flying on Sept 11 -- more security, more empty seats -- but never again. One of the reasons I am so glad that you wrote about this( and in exactly the way that you did) is because so many people would be too scared to write about it, too disempowered. I really wonder what those two Indian men must be feeling right now. I am so angry and upset on their behalf. As I was reading this aloud to my husband, I felt sick to my stomach and could barely get through it. Even now, my heart is racing. Thanks to Nicholas Kristof for posting it on Facebook. I 'm a total stranger to you but it would mean a lot to me if you, at some point( as you can), wrote a follow-up. But take care of yourself, first and foremost. Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we lost The War on Terror. We are terrorized... and your Kafkaesque experience is just one more proof of that. I heard that we now have a million more people on " security " payrolls since 911. All of those folks are watching US and not THEM. <h> Kush <h> Roz <p> How awful.... i am really sorry that u had to experience that. I often wonder about how a protest could bring attention to this issue. Makes me want to organize a group of little old ladies to don headscarves &; book a block of airline seats or s/t.... just to point out how unhelpful it is to discriminate based on appearance alone. God bless you for your own ability to forgive your captors. That is more strength than i have. <h> Michelle <p> I 'm very sorry this happended to you. I lived in NYC for 4 yrs and ca n't imagine a plane from there being detained like that. It 's such a diverse city. I hope that you are hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling some reassurance. Ironic too, this situation and the title of your blog( From the Heartland). In SF and NYC, we tend to think the midwest is a bit racist and backward and this does n't exactly dissuade from that( likely erroneous) perspective. <p> Get a civil rights lawyer and sue. You were detained without probably cause and handcuffed possibly this means " arrested " without " individualized suspicion. " Sue, sue, sue. Find others who suffered the same deprivation of your Constitutional rights and make it a class action. Let the federal government know that the people of this country are not going to tolerate law enforcement excesses like these and others. <h> Compassionate <p> So sorry to hear! Please forgive me for being somewhat relieved that for once someone other than myself, my race, experienced what we, my race has experience and continually experience our entire life times. For once you may feel some compassion for how blacks are targeted and the prejudice we face on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I have always wondered what special quality allows blacks in America to live their lives with such grace under these circumstances. This ole white lady wishes you all the best. <p> That is so messed up I 'm disgusted by the way the US and UK( and others) has turned out 10 years down the line. <p> I travelled through London Heathrow at on Sept 4th and in security something set the metal detector off. I was then subjected to what can only be described as a sexual assualt and thorough groping( although nothing like what you had to endure), followed a by a 20 minute long farcial inch by inch sweep over every part of me( head included -- I mean, WTF?) with the hand held wand thing, they were satisfied that my wedding ring or perhaps a rivet on my jeans was not a threat to humanity. <h> Dede <p> Am really sorry to hear about your story. I follow the link from FB and I get here. As part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of treatment at the airport, though not with the full extent as yours. I am from west africa, far from brown and have a " funny foreign name " and hip replacement. I get X-Ray treatment, full body search, explosive search and enhance checked baggage search almost every time i travel. And I missed some flight. I travel like 6 to 10 times a year. I end up arriving early at the airport, and keeping it cool when going during this humiliating process. <p> Wish you all the best and again, keep faith in this country not in the broken system <p> Thank you, thank you for going public with this unbelievable horror story. I 'm dumbstruck. Yes, we were on edge yesterday. We 'll be on edge again. But something critical has to be done in the way of training and protocol to eliminate egregious situations like this. Wishing you all the best, and the comfort of your family and friends. <h> Then Again <p> While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through I want to point out that you were not " racially " profiled it was your ethnicity( not that that makes it a happy day), no one knew your religion, anti-Semitic feelings are not a result of 9-11 and you do you own fair share of " racial profiling " about the police. I 'm sure a parable about stones and glass houses or perhaps motes and beams applies here. <h> So Annoyed By All the Hype <p> This line, " I hated speedboats and shitty beer in coozies and fat bellies and rednecks " is racial profiling. Rednecks? Really? You were strip-searched, you believe, because of your skin color, yet you have absolutely no problem using the same tactics for stereo-typing. You 're probably doing this out of anger, but that 's me giving you the benefit of the doubt. Everyone is racist.( Even though we use that term incorrectly.) <p> Did the police officer who has no a/c every day at work say " but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat, " or is that you simply projecting? Some of the side comments, like this one, are over-the-top and make you out to be very hateful against anyone who is n't you. It proves that you are no better than the person(s) who were afraid of you for what you looked like / how you behaved on that airplane. Even if you end your post with, " We should all try to get along. " The words fall flat. <p> I feel your rage and your humiliation, but I 'll take you getting profiled and searched any day over having something like 9/11 happen again. Oh, and I get profiled every time I go to the airport. I get the special treatment where they wipe my hands and my luggage handles / zippers to check for explosives. I am not of Middle Eastern descent. I was born in the USA. I have a boring English name. You are not the only one who has ever been profiled. I know you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom. <h> Sean <p> Anger is an excuse for malice, if it is temporary. But maliciousness is not acceptable as a default perspective on laws and justice in this country. I am sure if I got into a heated argument with some white redneck( Hey, I 'm white too!) I would moan about how backwoods rednecks were the bane of my existence until it was out of my system. It is only human. I would eventually get over it and go back to not hating anything country or seemingly backwards. <p> This is in no way comparable to the passive racism that is built into our law enforcement agencies when they pull aside people for no other reason than they are brown. One is a tragedy, the other is merely regrettable( I 'll leave it to you to sort out which is which.) <h> Jessie <p> Lisa you ar so right. Absolutely NOT. We do not need to accept this gross violation of our civil rights granted to us in our constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline ticket that you can be detained without reason and strip searched. Really people -- if you are an American learn your rights. The TSA can not strip search you or touch you unless you consent. As far as this incident is concerned I could MAYBE see being escorted off the plane, a pat down in private by another female, and questioning -- and that 's a real stretch when I say maybe. Under no circumstance was the strip search justified. Was she actually placed under arrest? If not, they absolutely violated her rights. The strip search and cavity search was uncalled for and an absolutely vile and gross abuse of her civil rights. Let 's not forget she passed through screening prior to the outbound flight -- that means no metal objects detected, etc. Additionally she did n't blow up the plane in flight. This level of invasive body search was UNCALLED for PERIOD. Now think if you would be OK with this if it was your 12 year old daughter, your 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother. People you need to wake up -- we are headed towards a police state where ANYONE can be detained without reason, strip searched, locked up, etc. etc. Will another terrorist incident occur -- maybe so. I hope not, but our security, TSA specifically, is not effective. While I would absolutely hate to see anyone else killed by terrorists I hate even more the loss of our civil liberties. I want to cry about what we have become as a nation -- a country willing to trample what our forefathers fought so hard for -- all because we are a bunch of scared wussies. <h> return to sanity <p> Guess what? I and Shoshana and everyone else have a constitutional right to call people( yes- even WHITE people) fat rednecks. We have a constitutional right to hate speedboats and country music. Nobody has a consitutional right to detain another american without the due process of law, nor the right to strip search another american without the due process of law. Shoshana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heck she wants to. They have no right to do what they did to her. <p> Wait, wait. " The price of freedom " is getting dragged off a plane into a cell, stripsearched and interrogated? Would n't that be the very definition of " no freedom? " <p> First you accuse her of lying about the last thing the cop said to her and then you accuse her of lying -again- when she says she wants people to get along. And why? Because she 's justifiably angry? Because she thought some uncharitable things, and dared to tell us that she thought them? <p> If you think your post was reasonable, you need to grow a clue. Seriously. <h> Angi <p> " You are not the only one who has ever been profiled. I know you wo n't be the last. This is the price of freedom. " Based on your words, I do n't think you have a clue what the word freedom means. Or what privilege you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not? Please. <p> I 'm sorry to break it to you, but having your hands and luggage handles wiped is NOT on par with being handcuffed, being taken to an undisclosed location, not being allowed to contact your family, being strip and/or cavity searched, and having the minutiae of your life examined for no reason at all. Not even CLOSE. <p> And I found her remarks thought-provoking and even enlightening : Can you not see the lesson there -- that bigotry begets bigotry, hatred fosters hatred, prejudice sows and reaps more prejudice? <p> Had the author encountered those same officers in another setting, I daresay their backgrounds would never have registered beyond a blip on her radar. But they were abusing their authority and she was the victim based on nothing more than her appearance, and her response was to think and feel -- however momentarily -- along the same lines. She felt anger and disgust towards those people. She was IN that situation because OTHER people feel( ten years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people behind the 9/11 attacks. And the ball just keeps rolling downhill, picking up speed... <h> e <p> I think you are missing the point of why she wrote these things... she was pointing out the own judgmental things that went through her mind during an ordeal that unless you have lived it, you can not pretend to understand or imagine. Later in her story she admits making these unfounded judgments( which you 're right, we are ALL guilty of), and says that doing so is always a dangerous, bad thing. It does not make her words fall flat -- it gives them sincerity. She is not being hateful or holier-than, she is being human. I would like to say that I wish some of the people writing ignorant, hurtful comments could understand that, but I have a feeling that those comments would find themselves to horrible stories like this no matter the circumstances. <p> How dare you or anyone else say, " I 'll take you getting profiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "? Of course NOBODY wants anything even close to what happened on that day again, but stripping innocent people( and American citizens) of their rights based on racist paranoia and fear will not stop that. All that does is fuel more unnecessary hatred and make injustices like this seem OK. Unless you have been in her shoes, you can not pretend to understand what she experienced because you have to have your hands wiped down before you board a plane -- the comparison alone is ridiculous. And who are YOU to decide what is acceptable for another to go through so you can feel a false sense of " security "? <p> Also, does n't the irony of the " freedom " awarded by incidents like this ever cross your mind? I think any argument for " freedom " here is absolutely unrecognizable. <h> Liz <p> No, this is NOT the price of freedom, because it DENIES freedom. What is wrong with you people who consider what she was subjected to to be mere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?? Is it possible that anyone can be so stupid??! She was thrown into a prison cell and STRIPPED SEARCHED!! Do you not get that?? If you are willing to go along with this happening to your FELLOW CITIZENS, then you are willingly giving up the freedoms you falsely claim to cherish. This is not protecting our freedom, this is attempting to ensure our physical safety -- and it is failing at that and succeeding at eliminating our freedom. <h> Sharroot <p> Hmmm.. my dictionary defines race as " a group sharing the same culture, history, language, etc. ; an ethnic group ". This lady was the victim -- she was cuffed, dragged off the plane, thrown in a cell, stripped, and cavity searched with no explanation. If she had a negative THOUGHT about the people doing it to her and wrote about it, it hardly constitutes as throwing stones! <h> Josh <p> I am so sorry that you went through this ordeal. I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am extremely disheartened whenever I hear that we 're not living up to our ideals. Unfortunately, it happens more than I would like. Your story greatly personalized the dichotomy, and that we still have n't fully worked through it yet. I hope that we do better by you, your family, and the 50 other " similar situations " that happened yesterday the next time. <h> Ibrahim Yousif <p> I 'm an Arab male, and if I was flying on 9/11 I would EXPECT to be treated that way, and be happy about it. What 's the big deal? That stuff happens ALL the time to me, and I understand... and I do n't feel that ANY of my rights are taken away. If you 're not doing anything wrong ; they will let you go soon enough. THIS GIRL JUST WANTS ATTENTION! " Oh, I had to pee sooo bad! "... spoiled brat... <p> Ibrahium- I completely agree!!!!! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so glad that you spoke out. I am appalled and would like if maybe everyone could stop the drama and focus on whats important. I would want to be stopped-Id feel better about our secuirty. I am sure if those two men were doing something.. and the FBI wasnt around-she 'd be complaining <h> Alison <p> Thank you for speaking out about your experience! I was directed here by a friend and I 've shared this with my Facebook friends. I 'm horrified by what you endured and by the larger implications it means for every American. <p> We 've traded our 4th amendment rights for a pottage of crap. The Patriot Act and the TSA are nothing but un-Constitutional power grabs dressed up as security theater. I 'm so sorry you had to endure what you did. <h> Jerry Lambada <p> I am sorry this happened to you, but you blew a great chance to make a statement. Calling people " fat Jada Pinkett Smith ", middle aged white cop, and profiling said individuals as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not support your claims about what you believe. Yes, you will justify it by saying you were angry about your treatment, but they were angry about 9/11, same difference. Pot, meet kettle. So, you can count 9/11/11 as not only the day you were treated poorly, but also the day you failed at becoming any kind of a credible blogger. <p> I left a similar comment. Prejudice 's run rampant in all ethnicity's.I was surprised no one else made any comments about the rude statements in this post. Saying she now hate 's rednecks and country music. Country music is one of the few genres that teach you to be kind and help your neighbors. Really she is no better herself than the cops who were forced to act upon suspicions whether they saw a threat or not. <h> e <p> I 'm pretty sure that since I 'm white, and I also hate rednecks, beer in coozies, speedboats, and country music, her dislike of those things -- especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic experience -- does not make Shoshana " racist ". <p> Further, expressing in a blog that she had thoughts about how much she disliked those things does not exactly equate to being illegally detained because the guy in the seat next to her spent too much time throwing up in the bathroom. <p> When she refuses to hire someone based on his dislike of country music, THEN y'all can call her a prejudiced bigot. <h> CL <h> Thada <p> This is appalling. I am so sorry you and your seatmates were put through that. I hope you find a way to prevent this from affecting your feelings of safety for too long. Maybe a hypnotherapist or an NLP practitioner can assist you to reframe this incident to lessen its effect on your well-being over time. Best wishes. <p> Thank you for posting this. I 've shared it and really admire that you put this out there. <p> I do n't know whether to be angry at the system that did this or the extremists that made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up very well when you said " We live in a complicated world that, to me, seems to have reached a breaking point. " As someone who just went through that and I 'm sure is dealing with the anger, it 's a remarkable thing to have that perspective. <h> Bailey <p> I am so sorry that this happened to you and you are a better person than me -- I would be raging mad and not so level-headed. Thank you for your account of what happened. <p> I hope you sue to at least find out who made the ridiculous complaint and what the complaint actually was. Maybe some good would come out of this if you could sit down with the person who made the complaint so the person understands the ramifications of racially profiling. A teaching experience. <h> Ben <p> I am a fat white man who likes beer and country music. I am horrified at how you were treated. <p> I take your story as another example of the nation I love having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The terrorist attacks of 9/11 do NOT excuse such reactions to whatever illusions of threats the authorities can think up.( As a law-abiding citizen, I have had two of my own encounters with overreacting law enforcement in the past year.) <h> sue patterson <p> This seems so wrong on so many levels. I hope you consult an attorney. I do not think they can STRIP SEARCH you, just because someone on the plane did n't like the color of your skin. I am not a lawyer, nor have I ever sued anyone in my life, but if that 's the language they understand, I 'd consider it. From one American woman to another, I am so sorry you had to endure this. It 's just horrible! But I am truly grateful that you were able to write about it, so we could understand first-hand what is going on. <p> The world over, we 're letting governments get more and more control over our lives by letting them have laws that take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad that those that are meant to serve us are turning into our masters in the name of " protecting " us. Terrible experience -- I hope you recover well enough to enjoy travel again. <h> Nelsene McGinn <p> A nightmare experience that no one should have to endure. We are no longer free in this country and it makes me very sad. I am so sorry you had to go through such an ordeal. I will share your story in the hope that things will eventually change and we will recover our freedoms. I hate to say that I am not very optimistic. <h> Mike <h> Robert Arthur <p> I am appalled at this. Each and every one of us should print this posting out, and send a copy of it along with a well worded letter to our congressman, and our senators, put them in envelopes, with a stamp and mail them, demanding that this agency be defunded and disbanded. They have made a mockery of airline security, they have abused, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than we had a decade ago. Get them out of our pants and our airports today. <p> Senator Levin will be receiving a copy of my letter before the close of the week. <p> I only hope I can respond with as much dignity and grace as you when they come for me. <h> Longinus <p> Just wanted to congratulate you on a great blog post and let you know that you handled the situation with class and dignity. Americans need to hear that there is a true human cost to all this racial paranoia circulating around the country. Thank you for sharing your story and I hope it not only helps change some attitudes out there but brings you something positive in life. Best wishes in the future. <p> I am simply appalled at what this country has become. As a fellow American who did n't do everything in his power to fight the creation of this police state, I apologize for what you experienced from the bottom of my heart. <h> Margie <p> I am truly disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not happen in the rest of the world, but it has certainly made me think twice about ever visiting America with my half Persian children and I will certainly discourage them from ever visiting in the future. The funny thing is that my children have nothing to do with their Persian father, though they share his Persian last name, and are real little Kiwis( we 're from New Zealand). This really disturbs me as I think of what could happen in the future to my kids. While everyone is so busy looking for middle eastern or dark skinned terrorists they may very well miss real threats to national security. How is it possible in 2011 for racism like this to exist? The hysteria surrounding ' terrorism ' &; ' terrorists ' is outrageous. I hope that as many people as possible see this. So sorry that this happened to you! <p> I am sorry this happened to you. The truly sad thing is this has happened before in American history. It was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During that era people got accused and lost jobs by someone calling them a communist. Now go back and read the link but put terrorist or Muslim in place of communist. <p> I feel sorry for you, but you clearly have the confidence and mental fortitude to navigate life, so you do n't need much support. BTW you should always ask " am I free to go? " And if the answer is " no ", demand a lawyer. It 's not safe to answer ANY question. <p> I feel far sorrier for the COWARD who reported you. They need to grow some balls, and stop being afraid. <p> No Ms. Berchtold, the public does n't want you to error on the side of caution. It wants you to do your job without the gross violation of civil rights. There were a 1,000 better ways to handle this situation that would have served the purpose of the individual and the greater good. If this is protocol, then game over. The terrorists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your story as I was suppose to get on that plane and take it from DTW-DEN. I am sorry for the ordeal you had to endure. <p> The story as TSA/Homeland security seemed to be working from was that two people in the same row both independently spent 20 minutes in both of the bathrooms. Sounds a tad excessive and suspicious to me. I know when I go into an airplane bathroom I want to do is get out as quickly as possible. <p> Seems like you may have just been sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time. <p> Jeff your apathy is exactly how this country got to this level. Instead of being outraged and shocked by this treatment you chalk it up to " wrong place wrong time " cliche non-sense. You make excuses for the people who take power to the extreme. <h> brady <p> I feel sorry for being an American, after reading of this event. I wish I could have been there to call the paranoids out. Too many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right to be Americans. <h> auradis <h> Kim <p> I would never have been able to have kept my temper or held myself together as you did. I do n't understand how they had the right to ask you question or strip search(!!!!!) you without telling you anything about what was happening to you or why! No lawyer??? This is permissible in this country?? <p> I 'm floored. Also shocked and sickened by this. And so, so sorry you had to go through this. :( <p> Because she was n't formally arrested. Until the police tell you the charge, you are n't technically " under arrest ". It is important to note that the police can detain you, usually up to 24 hours, without a charge. This is in order to conduct an investigation such as this. They also are n't required to advise you of your Miranda rights if they have n't charged you yet. If you feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onus is on you to tell the police before answering their questions... however, it can get tricky. Because you have n't been placed under arrest, it can be considered a crime to " hinder " an investigation by not answering their questions. In order to ensure that the police ca n't do this, it 's important to tell them " I have the right to remain silent ". Every question they ask, repeat that line as your answer. Whatever you do, do n't say anything snarky that the police can later claim you said to try and mislead them( that 's also a crime). If you want an attorney present, then repeat the line " I have the right to an attorney ". It 's really important though that you say absolutely nothing else if that 's the route you want to take. As you can see though... you 'll go home a lot faster if you just answer their questions. If you take the " I know my rights " route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lot longer( and, remember, attorneys are expensive -- you need to be destitute to get a free one). <h> pete.d <p> Yeah, it 's really awful when people know their rights and say so. We should definitely discourage anyone from learning what their rights are, and if they should accidently become educated, under no circumstances should they reveal that they know their rights. <p> After all, we would n't want to upset those law enforcement officers, would we? They can be so darn fragile! <p> A better response than " I have the right to an attorney " would be the more explicit, and more technically correct, " I am exercising my Fifth Amendment right to decline to answer questions without the advice of an attorney, and I am formally requesting the presence of an attorney. "( Disclaimer : I am a paralegal, but not a lawyer.) <p> However, as others have pointed out, one has to weigh the risks of making such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the wrong call here. Like they tell rape survivors about their decisions to/not to fight back, " if you survived, then you made the right decision. " <h> Chucky <p> Charles, your understanding of the constitutional requirements under the " Miranda case seems somewhat limited. a person can not be required to answer any questions when detained by the police( With or without being informed of charges). They are supposed to be advised of their rights whenever they are questioned while being detained. refusing to answer when you are detained is a right, not a crime. <h> Carey <h> ruth <p> I 'm very sad to hear of your experience. It 's unfortunate that three strangers with physical appearances that reveal an " other " ethnicity and happen to be sitting next to each other is interpreted by some as " suspicious. " I, too, believe that the terrorists have gained some by instilling a level of racial, cultural and religious( whether perceived or real difference) intolerance that has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for the day that this chapter in our history comes to a close, and the racism and intolerance that has been an ongoing knee-jerk reaction to the acts of a specific group on Sept. 11 are put in perspective... and that those who 've been given some power and authority through public trust do the responsible things to put it into perspective and make things right. Sometime I wonder if we 'll ever learn, though, if we 're unable to look back at the nation 's past experiences -- the marginalization and genocide of Native American tribes, African slavery, imprisoning of Japanese Americans in concentration camps, and so many more chosen treatments of large groups of people -- is this just who we are? During the VietNam War I was born, it ended when I was 9. But even as a little girl, half-Filipino( my mom obviously full), because my siblings and I looked enough like we were Vietnamese, other kids from some neighborhoods called us " Frenchie "( for French Indochinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate war so much. For those who have the physical appearance of an " other, " you are often made to feel ugly, dirty, at fault, unwelcome... in your own home. I 'm sorry this happened to you. I hope your story makes people remember who we are at our best. <h> JAlmos <p> There 's nothing more to say than to express how sorry I am that this happened to you and that I hope every single one of our fellow countrymen will see this, know the injustice of it and seek to act on it. <p> This really bothers me. I do n't want to live here anymore. This is not peaceful or free country. What, we can be detained now, because some other person is bothered by our appearance, without evidence of any wrongdoing? Are you kidding me? <h> Japheth Ross <p> I 'm terribly sorry that you have personally witnessed the indirect intended effect of terrorism. As a fellow American resident, I 'm happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security and understand the difficulties encountered in the process but yet dismayed at the racial profiling prevalent in these undertakings. I applaud you for keeping a sound judgement in all this saga but ashamed that our freedom and security is attained by violating the rights of people such as yourself simply by their appearance. You wrote, " You understand why we have to do this, right? It 's for our own protection, " she told me. -- Two wrongs do n't make a right. Until the day Americans are free of bigoted assumptions, the patriot act should be abolished and replaced with a humane policy that serves protection to every American equally without comprising the civil liberties of others. Until then, it would be wrong and insulting for some, to say that the Homeland Security has kept us safe since that fateful day of 9/11. <h> ken <p> Before the so-called " PATRIOT " Act, this event would have provoked rage across the country ; the perpetrators would be fired and their agency sued ; Congressmens ' telephones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engenders sympathy for the victim and excuses for the perpetrators? The terrorists with a little help from bin Laden and his ilk have won. <p> I 'm sorry this happened. I 'm sorry for some people 's reactions. And I thank you for your calm, your composure, and your willingness to share. No one should be judged by their appearance, or put through what you went through. Thank you for your courage to share. <h> John <p> Maybe I missed it, but did they read you your rights or were you not officially detained? Easy for me to say, as it was n't me, but you should have refused to answer until you had been read your rights and had a lawyer. <h> John Hopkins <p> Thank you for sharing your story. As an anglo male I 'm fairly unlikely to be forced to undergo the indignities you suffered. Reading your account made me feel sick and humiliated for what my country, the " land of the free " I grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best as you seek to regain your balance. <h> Chris <p> sorry to hear about this, Shoshana. I am from Metro Detroit. Most of us are pretty awesome. I have my suspicions that the person who " reported " you and your seatmates are probably not from here, because you resemble just about 1/4th of SE Michigan. In fact, you look a lot like an old friend of mine! I am glad you are home safe with your family and I hope you do n't think we 're a bunch of assholes. <p> I 'm so sorry you had to go through that. At the same time I saw some prejudice 's of your own in your post though. You repeatedly mention how fat everyone is. Even the kind officer who did n't want to strip search you. How you hate " rednecks " not all rednecks are backwoods racist a-holes. The term originated from men who work outside and because of that their necks are sunburned. You hate country music? Why because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rights were violated but that is no reason to turn that hate on others. I would be very upset in your situation also, I am Jewish on my mother 's side so do n't think it 's coming from someone who does n't understand at all. You are writing about equality and not judging people yet that 's what you did through your post. I 'm surprised no one else noticed, I guess your right, people are blind to prejudice 's now. <h> Eloisa Perez-Lozano <p> Hi Shoshanna! I have n't really kept in touch since grad school, but I saw this link on Patti 's Facebook and I thought it might be yours. I 'm so sorry you had to go through this. I do n't know how you kept your cool through it all, but I respect you so much for all you endured. I hope you do seek legal counsel about this because this was completely violating your rights no one deserves that!!! <p> I am sick to my stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm surprised that this was allowed to happen to you, but I 'm not. And that makes me angry. This is America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave. Or it used to be. Now I 'm not sure what we are, but Free and Brave are not it. <h> Lucas Neill <p> Shoshana, I do feel sorry that you had to undergo such a terrible experience but can you actually blame the authorities for racial profiling on 9/11 when there 's so much tension in the air with talked of a credible threat? The bad guys who conducted the 9/11 murders were all ' ethnic ' looking, UNFORTUNATELY. And, can I say, you are pretty disparaging in your description of the officers of the law even though, by your own account, they were professional and polite. <h> zack <p> Dear Shebshi, As a " I am truly disgusted that this happened to you. I 'm even more disgusted to read comment by hateful &; racisit individuals such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American) I do n't know what that means Margaret Helmick, Jan &; Jay : as a naturalized citizen, As a law abiding citizen, as a Muslim &; as a US Navy Veteran I say shame on you. I ca n't believeI swore to protect racits like you Margaret Helmick, Jan &; Jay : as a tax payer, as a Moroccan Born man I say kiss my dark skin A
