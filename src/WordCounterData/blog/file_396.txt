5147841 <h> One Day At a Time, Sweet Jesus <p> written by Sarah published on October 25, 2012 0 Persons left their comments <p> Every single day holds opportunity. <p> That 's 365 opportunities a year. <p> If you commit to doing even one thing each day to invest in people, you 'll have built a small community around yourself by the end of the year. <p> Here 's something small you could start with today : <p> Send an email to check on that co-worker who has been absent. Take a meal, or order takeout, for someone who is recovering from sickness, surgery or loss. Offer to babysit someone 's kids free of charge to give them an inexpensive night out or a free day to run backed up errands. Write a hand-written thank you note and put a good old-fashioned stamp on it. <p> Ask about how someone 's weekend went... and really listen. Take the time to learn the names of your peers ' children. Pick up the phone just to say hi. Touch base for no reason. Extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a little league, flag football or soccer game that must be attended. <p> Christmas shop with friends. <p> Is it silly to " plan " for friendship? Should n't that come naturally? <p> Probably. But is it happening on it 's own? <p> If not, there 's nothing wrong with being intentional. With taking out that marker and checking off a day of doing something, purposefully, to invest in others. <p> Practice eventually become habit. And habits give way to whole new ways of living. <p> Sometimes it 's one day at a time, sweet Jesus. <p> And before you know it, those days will add up into weeks and years of friendship. Even the pyramids were built one block at a time. <p> Enter your email to get my blog
