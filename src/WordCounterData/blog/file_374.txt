The logic of the markets and other compelling business reasons have brought together innovation clusters from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Sweden, the northern part of Germany, Northern Netherlands and northwestern Russia. <p> " We have a wide range of competencies across all areas of health and life sciences with a very well-established pharmaceutical sector that is mature and industrialized in the western region, while in the eastern area of the Baltic there is an emerging activity with smaller companies. " <p> The contrasting opportunities of the more developed Scandinavian rim of the Baltic and the emerging southeastern edge will play out at BIO-Europe. <p> In the Monday afternoon session, ScanBalt will present selected initiatives, developing pipelines and collaboration opportunities from the four Nordic countries. <p> Academics and executives from the emerging eastern rim will be among participants at BIO-Europe. <p> " There is tons of good science coming out of the eastern Baltic as recent investments have demonstrated, " said Frank. " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Bloc countries that provided a solid basis for building the strong position they hold today in certain sectors. " <p> There is a political will to support the development of health services and life sciences as well, he said. <p> Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius was a co-founder of ScanBalt and very active in supporting the development of health and life sciences, said Frank, while for example Estonia has an established national biotech strategy it is pursuing. <p> " In Lithuania there is the very good example of Fermentas, " he said, a spinoff from Vilnius University that recently was sold to Thermo Scientific to be part of the Molecular Biology group. <p> Prime Minister Kubilius recently reported that to follow the rapid development of biotech the nation is investing EUR 400 million into five research valleys with the goal of becoming one of the top high tech innovation centers in Europe. <p> ScanBalt is also actively promoting a strategy for reversing the brain drain that saw promising scientists leave for opportunities in western countries. <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment there would be a tremendous gain for the region, " said Frank, citing the case of ScanBalt board member, Daumantas Matulis, who returned from the Johnson &; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development group to head the Laboratory of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design at Vilnius University. <p> The success of ScanBalt has often been cited by the European Union as a best practice for macro-regional cooperation and a model for similar efforts being organized along the Danube and the Mediterranean. <p> " It is an excellent example of how a shared resource such as the sea can be a focus for shared interests, " he said. " The case is most clearly made in marine biology where we share common challenges to be solved with an interest in building business from the Baltic Sea itself but in a way that is sustainable and responsible. " <p> " There are things to be done at the European level, and there are national concerns, but some challenges are easier to solve as a macro-region, " he said.
