5133241 <p> Reports on the ground are that over 32k votes were recounted today in 12 hours which finished around 9PM, but for some reason the remaining 304 votes could n't be completed in 2 hours. Officials are saying an automatic alarm is set at 11PM and they are forcing everyone to leave and come back in the morning at 8AM to finish the recount. The deadline is tomorrow noon. <p> I asked, how is the alarm being automatically set, when you guys were here until 2 am on election night.... Their response to me.. We are closing. Sheriff then ask me leave <p> This certainly smells fishy and hopefully people will stand guard tonight to ensure the building is and do not engage in personal attacks. Otherwise we will revoke your comment privileges. <p> http : //twitter.com/KelsH2 Kels H2 <p> I hope people are standing guard and video surveillance is being utilized. Just to be on the safe side. <p> las1 <p> Alarm! Ha! <p> More likely a dog whistle for Democrats. <p> freenca <p> That does certainly raise the eyebrows and wrinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sure it stinks. And if they 're not careful, West 's people will step in t and not realize it, because the vote thieves are doing their best to hide their tracks. <p> marketcomp <p> I think we need to show some patience. I mean these people have been going every since 8:00AM this morning. I think that if the results remained would n't they annouce that immediately? Although, I am not sure what would happen if the count remains or if LTC. West was ahead its a public relations call. Moreover, if there are more than 304 votes or ballots to be counted then could more be added over night without sounding an alarm? Moreover, these 304 ballots or votes are suppose to be hand counted so that tells me that the machine count is completed and this was a stopping point, maybe. I do n't know the process for recounting in Florida but I think it 's far from the nightmare in 2000. I just hope that Allen West wins or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> See, that is the problem. They seem to have their own rules or make them up so no one knows anything. Then they work their vote counting magic and the Dem wins every time. <p> marketcomp <p> You are right BetsyRoss! I am seeing that early voting is the problem. When they get those votes in no one is watching so those votes can be double counted or maybe triple counted to get the results that they need. And does anyone think that the union thugs in conjunction with the Prez would n't triple count ballots when no one is looking? How does anyone knoe when the ballots come in, especilly the military ballots. The RNC must do something about this either give every ballot a serial number that is tamper proof, tamper proof a seal so if broken can not be reused, program machines to only one number for one ballot, or eliminate early voting all together. <p> " It 's not the people who vote that count. It 's the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Patriot077 <p> I 'm very curious about the results of the votes counted today.... I hope someone in West 's camp knows the number. <p> Centurian3333 <p> Allen West was the runaway favorite to be Florida 's governor in 2014 if our current governor were not running for election. That Sunshine News Viewpoint poll ran West against Florida 's top political names. Sid <p> Luker410 <p> Move Along... Nothing to see here. <p> Centurian3333 <p> West was the runaway winner in a Sunshine News Viewpoint Poll, topping 14 top Florida candidates. The poll asked if the current Florida governor chose not to run for re-election, who would you choose as the candidate? West topped the field. <p> white531 <p> What a surprise. <p> sjmom <p> Maybe they know Allen West has won and they want to delay the announcement as long as possible. <p> white531 <p> People like the man. Ca n't keep them from doing that. It is what it is. The average American is looking for a leader they can believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a born leader. He has, " Patriot, " written all over him. You ca n't sweep a person like Allen West under the rug. He is here to stay. <p> We have to get rid of Obama, they have to get rid of Allen West. Let 's see who wins. <p> JRD1 <p> No, the corrupt Bush crime family has to get rid of Allen West. The Soros backed progressives merely assist. Wake up! The corrupt gopE is NOT your friend. The corrupt Republican controlled Jeb Bush Florida legislature redistricted West out of his seat. West came up with a blueprint of how he could still keep his seat. The gopE chose to redistrict West out of his seat instead of DNC chair Wasserman-socialist! <p> sDee <p> Two competing crime families. That analogy fits what we see all around us. <p> http : **37;26536;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> Some people are talking about Obama 's third term.

After all, this is ' only ' a House seat! <p> I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an enormous effort to keep Allen West out. I think this is the tip of the iceberg, and the dems are running scared of getting found out. It is very odd however that the GOPe nationally and in Florida is keeping utterly quiet about this, that the ' new leaders ' like Jindal or Rubio are having nothing to say about this scandal at all. Obviously, the corrupt MSM are not interested and thus are not reporting anything. What do they care about the foundations of the republic! <p> " Fishy " is n't even beginning to describe this heap of stinking manure! <p> http : **37;26676;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> It 's probably not just the democrats that want him out. That is a good sign, if the establishment is agreed on getting rid of him. <p> Edit : Whoever the establishment goes after must be a good guy. <p> colliemum <p> True -- the GOPe do not want any true conservative in their ranks, and are happy to tacitly or openly help the dems/socialists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. The way they treated Sarah Palin is proof, if any were needed. Now the same with Allen West : letting him twist in the wind, never mind that the basis on which the Republic is supposed to function is being destroyed by these criminal manipulations of the election process. <p> It 's becoming more evident by the day that the GOPe does not deserve the trust of the people -- and nor do all those who, from the safety of their seat, overlook what is going on. Yes, Mr Jindal and Mr Rubio -- I am talking of you! <p> http : **37;26715;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> I now believe that the federal government is illegitimate, and the states are going to have to act. If not, then it is all lost. Either nullification or succession will take place, or this country will be finished of in a few short years. <p> The fire of liberty is dimming. <p> p m <p> Want to know why the republicans do n't, wo n't and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full story about how the reps gave the rats full license to commit voter fraud... everywhere. It is truly scandalous. This is how they stole this election : <p> I 've read this, and I 've seen it linked in various places for some time now. <p> If the GOPe really is hiding behind this decision, then they have extremely bad lawyers counselling them. But then again, as many have said since 2011 : the GOPe did not really want to win this election, because they want a clear run for either Jeb Bush or one of his surrogates in 2016. We were called conspiracy wingnuts at that time -- but it is looking more and more likely, is n't it! <p> BrooklynNYConservative <p> **30;26754;TOOLONG... the electoral college <p> http : **37;26786;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> The electoral college was designed to keep the big cities from voting for everyone else. it has been turned around to allow the stupid masses to control the rest of the country. <p> This country would be politically unrecognizable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment is over, and liberty has lost. Lincoln ended states rights, and general Lee was correct in saying that he was fighting to save the republic. It just took a few more decades for the banks and corporations to take over. <p> http : //tinyurl.com/wwsotu Wolfie <p> Hiding behind that agreement is a cop out, a sell out and a cowardly way out. They are the GOP not the EMM( Excuse Making Machine) or at least I thought they were. <p> BOPOS <p> I think a recount of every ballot from every precinct in the entire Country should be double checked. I would bet my life Romeny really won. <p> http : **37;26825;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> Romney was nominated via fraud, then lost the election due to fraud. This is how it works in America now. <p> There is no way to count all of the ballots, because the ballots do n't exist in many areas. We now have electronic elections, and he who controls the machines controls the electorate. <p> JRD1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Bush crime family saw to that! <p> BOPOS <p> There was a paper printer that recorded my vote on my machine. I do n't know if all are that way. Why do you say Romney won nom by fraud? <p> http : **37;26864;TOOLONG librtifirst <p> Most people that I talk to are not aware of it, because it was the RP people who forced it, and exposed it. It did get some coverage by the media, but it was liberal media that covered it to slam the GOP during the primary. It was basically under the radar of most conservatives. <p> RP was focusing on campaigning hard in the caucus states. Though he has little chance of winning the nomination, he would have had a platform at the convention if he won enough states. In the end, he did win enough states to get a platform at the convention, but was still denied. <p> Nevada is the best example of fraud in the primary, so for the purpose of narrowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example, I will limit to that for now. <p> Most of the fraud was recorded via " handy cam " and personal testimony. There are many youtube videos on this. The vote counts in the states were taken at the caucus ', then phoned in to a secret tabulation location that the GOP set up. Many who were at the caucus ' recorded the individual vote counts. When they checked on their votes later, the numbers were flipped for Romney. In some cases, a particular district recorded 2 votes for Romney, then after checking with the state GOP as to how they were recorded found out that Romney was awarded 22 of their votes. <p> The RP people won Nevada hands down. They won it because the took almost all of the delegate slots. They could not take that many delegate slots if they did n't actually get most of the votes, because delegates are awarded to a particular candidate based on how many votes they got. The delegates are awarded at the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their candidates. <p> After the RP people literally took over the Nevada state GOP, the Romney camp and the national GOP came into Nevada and created their own new GOP and simply cut out the duly elected RP delegates. <p> You could do a search on youtube for " Maine delegates ", or " Maine RNC ", and you will get an idea about how they nullified the Maine delegates. <p> Nebraska brought in electronic voting machine to the state convention at the last minute. This is not how it is normally done, but the electronic machines can be used to put in whoever they want, and the RP people were dominating Nebraska. <p> Oregon( my state) cut out their duly elected RP delegates and put in their Romney delegates. <p> The rules changes made at the RNC were all about being able to do all of this according to the new rules, in the next election. It was all illegal this time around and against the GOP rules. Do your remember how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are a few, but what needs to be understood is that where electronic voting took place, the primary could easily be rigged, and the caucus ' were exposed to be fraudulent because of the open process. <p> Legally elected Missouri Chairman arrested : <p> If we ever want a non-establishment nominee, then we had better do what the Paul people did, and on a mass scale. We had also better get rid of electronic voting and vote counting. We can not allow the GOP to flip the votes in a " secret " counting location. It does n't matter who is running, their pick will take votes from all of the rest. <p> Rocco11 <p> You have to watch those Leftist criminals like a hawk... <p> http : //twitter.com/duluthcook Sally Morris <p> I 've been looking for an update all day Saturday.
