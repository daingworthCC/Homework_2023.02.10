5123741 <h> A Little Bit Nasty <p> I have noticed some really disgusting things lately. Like yesterday when I was about to sit down on my commuter train, I saw what appeared to be crumbs on the seat. But upon closer inspection, I realized they were fingernail clippings. A whole bunch of them, like they were purposely piled up and waiting for someone to come sit on them. My Scottish Work Friend( SWF) emailed me about an hour later to say that a woman sitting next to her on the train was cutting her nails with a nail clipper. Ewwww. I get that time is short these days, but why is a commuter train the perfect place to dispose of body parts? <p> This morning as I was walking past a number of train cars to get to my usual one, I saw a gentleman in a suit and tie, briefcase next to him, go digging with his index finger deep into his nose. It was n't even like he was trying to hide it. Have some shame, Sir! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles, trying to pull out whatever was in there. Maybe he stores his metro card or keys or something -- he was pretty frantic about it. <p> I was walking Wally early this morning and about 30 feet away, I saw another dog owner patiently waiting for her dog to do its business. Only half way through the dog doing his thing, the owner realized she did n't have any plastic poop bags. Before I even had a chance to offer one up, the woman used the edge of her newspaper to kind of scoot the poop onto it. Only she could n't get the whole " log " onto the paper. She tried sliding the paper a couple of times under the poop, but it was tricky as she only had one hand( other hand being on the leash). So at the last second( maybe she thought I was n't looking), she used her leash hand to place the poops on the paper. Then she threw the paper out. NASTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk back into her building, putting her hands all over the door handles, etc. She is a walking advertisement for hand sanitizer. <p> I will leave you on that very pleasant note. Got any of your own? I promise my next post will be way more civilized. <h> 2 comments on " A Little Bit Nasty " <p> I work with a room full of third graders so the amount of nasty I see on a daily basis is incredible. I have a particularly icky group of boys in my room. There is so much nose picking, booger eating, pencil chewing, water bottle licking, and general disgustingness that it can be overwhelming! Since the germs in my room are contained, I just walk around squirting everyone 's hands with hand sanitizer and scrubbing surfaces with Clorox wipes. Seems to do the trick! Your dog poo story had me on the verge
