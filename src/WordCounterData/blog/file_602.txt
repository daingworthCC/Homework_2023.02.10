5168641 <h> The importance of a coal mine in Beallsville <p> Over the summer, Mitt Romney held a campaign event in Beallsville, Ohio, with a group coal miners, which was soon after turned into a television ad in the Buckeye State. But as it turns out, the closer one looks at the campaign stop, the more interesting it becomes. <p> For one thing, the miners used as props by the Romney campaign lost pay during the event, and were " forced to attend. " The Obama campaign even put out an ad of its own on this a few days ago. <p> This week, however, the story took another twist. The mine in question is owned by Robert Murray, an ardent Romney backer and major GOP donor. He 's the one, of course, who told the miners that " attendance " at the campaign photo-op was " mandatory. " As Alec MacGillis reports, that 's not all he 's accused of doing. <p> Since 2007, employees of Murray Energy and its subsidiaries, along with their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Republican candidates for federal office. Murray 's fund-raisers have feted the likes of Scott Brown, Rand Paul, David Vitter, Carly Fiorina, and Jim DeMint. Home-state pols get love, too. Murray 's PAC and staffers are the sixth-largest source for Ohio senatorial hopeful Josh Mandel. They 've given $720,000 to candidates for state office in the past decade. <p> Internal Murray documents show just how upset Murray becomes when employees fail to join the giving. In missives, he cajoles employees to attend fund-raisers and scolds them when they or their subordinates do not. In cases of low participation, reminders from his lieutenants have included tables or spreadsheets showing how each of the eleven Murray subsidiaries was performing. And at least one note came with a list of names of employees who had not yet given. " What is so difficult about asking a well-paid, salaried employee to give us three hours of his/her time every two months? " Murray writes in a March 2012 letter. " We have been insulted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Wait, it gets worse. <p> MacGillis ' report added : <p> The pressure to give begins as soon as employees enter the company, the Murray sources say. At the time of hiring, supervisors tell employees that they are expected to contribute to the company PAC by automatic payroll deduction -- typically 1 percent of their salary, a level confirmed by a 2008 letter to employees from the PAC 's treasurer.( That letter also assures employees that they would not be " disadvantaged " by not giving.) Employees are given a form to sign, explaining that the giving is voluntary. " In the interview... I was told that I would be expected to make political contributions -- that Murray just expected that, " says the first source. " But I was told not to worry about it, because my bonuses would more than make up what I would be asked to contribute. " <p> Unions do n't have the authority to fire workers. Management does. Contributions to union PACs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought against someone who chooses not to give. <p> It 's commonly referred to as a joke, MP. I have found attempts at humor and irony to be theraputic when dealing with the current right wingers. I watched portions of that speech by Romney live, and I was kind of bummed out that the backdrop of those blue collars made pretty good TV. But like all current events these days that involve Republicans, it was a fraud. <p> whats the bet that somewhere in all of this employees were encouraged to " Disclose " the identities of known registered Democrats or people who contributed to other parties or campaigns than those approved and supported by the management 's PAC? <p> If the miners have a union, then that is the body that should file a grievance and complaint with the NLRB. There may be a state and federal labor law that might be applicable. Nothing could be better than watching the mine owner having to reimburse everyone for time and contributions as well as monitoring by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Romney 's secret now known quaint story about the Factory in China with the barbed wire... When I explain these things to people I know... many of them do n't believe this man could be so callous. Please, let people know about this stuff! <p> what a complete @! $%# with his " astonishment " that employees wo n't just roll over and " give " three hours of free labor so he can contribute the profit he makes from their sweat to some political candidate they do n't support. <p> We are n't even keeping political influence out of the tax-exempt religious orgs. Political nonpartisanship is not mandatory for private sector businesses the way it is for government and their contracted interests. <p> Workers either abide by the company rules or depart for less stringent lands. And since the lauded job creators are n't creating, workers are conveniently locked down where they are. <p> The repubs never say which regulations they want to get rid of,,, I 'll bet mr. murray does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety violations. Judgeing from the rummy campaign, fraud is legal now. <p> For salaried employees, the BONUS more than makes up for the 1% VOLUNTARY contribution to the PAC. And there 's absolutely no chance that anybody is going to have that PAC donor list when they decide the bonuses, right? R-i-ght. <p> This is pretty clearly using the " discretionary " bonus program to fund the PAC. Which is illegal. <p> As for the hourly employees, they have NO UNION. Therefore they are n't contributing to any PAC through union dues. And, they have no one to complain to( except the media) when they are coerced into attending a rally while the mine is shut down for Romney 's visit. <p> I understand that the company was not required to run the mine that day, and actually it would be illegal to pay the workers to attend the rally. But if there was no pay, the workers should have felt free to stay home. Some did, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend. Whether that coercion exceeded the bounds of election law, is for a court to decide. <p>( The song is about faux solidarity between the union miners and the cops policing their strike. Things for miners here are probably not as bad as conditions in Maggie Thatcher 's England in 1984 but many of
