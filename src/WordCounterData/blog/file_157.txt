5123841? You guys only think it 's crucial when Democrats are president. <h> In defense of the people who operate oil, gas wells <p> Those attacking Colorado 's oil and gas industry forget the hard-working people drilling and operating these wells live in Colorado. I am part of that industry. Before you demonize us, remember this : we live here, raise our families here, have friends here, volunteer here, coach kids ' sports here, cheer for the Broncos here, and hike, bike and ski here. Do you really believe that we do n't care about the air we breathe? Or our children? Or the communities in which we live? Many of us live here because we love Colorado 's great outdoor activities. <p> As your furnace heats your home on a crisp winter morning, locally produced natural gas provides that heat. You can thank your neighbor for that. When you fill up your car, ask yourself : would you prefer to buy gas from the Middle East or gas produced in Colorado, by Coloradans, for Coloradans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See our commenting ground rules for more information. <p> Anonymous <p> Liquified Natural Gas is making inroads to the US transportation market but has a long way to go before readers of your letter can feel warm and cozy filling their tank with natural gas. <p> Nobody is demonizing the worker bees enacting the energy boom here. What is rightly condemned is the profit as fast as possible model that leaves tons of fracking chemicals in open ended shale fields where we do not know where they will migrate, and for how long. <p> When residents are inundated with smelly, loud rigs that light up the night for acres and acres that sicken livestock and families, those valuable jobs begin to lose their attraction. <p> irisman <p> I do n't know where the truth lies.

Ever since PUC allowed the building of pipelines for Xcel 's benefit, instead of having among the lowest natural gas rates in the US( ours was n't as smart as Wyoming 's -- which negotiated an " in state deal ") it 's right up there with the cost in states which have no natural gas( and -- to add insult to injury, the COLORADO rate payers paid for the pipeline). As far as gasoline -- a separate subject -- last year, for the first time in decades, the gas and oil were the largest US import -- while prices here have gone higher and impacted everything else from food to clothing to heat to air fares( and yet commodity this does n't " count " as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 being a " higher than ever " profit year for the industry, the price at the pump should be $1/gallon LESS( I 'm guessing that this year will have even
