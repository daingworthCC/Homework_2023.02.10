Some are chuckling, but they might want to rethink their take on the first woman on a GOP presidential ticket. <p> Conservative pundit David Brooks laughed out loud at the suggestion, calling her a " joke ". Her former running mate John McCain called her " irrelevant. " Others point to 2008 wannabes Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee as more qualified and doing better in polls than Palin when people talk about GOP Presidential hopefuls. Of course, most thought that quitting her day job as Alaska Governor was the death knell for her political career, but I think this is just the beginning of Palin 's national political career. After all, she was just on Oprah! <p> Seriously, as I have to remind some who 've accused me of being a closet Republican, I 'm no political fan of Palin. But when people dismiss her out of hand, I keep thinking one thing -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to being competent enough for the White House? <p> Yup -- George W. Bush. And then we said, " Oh, well, at least he 'll only be a one-termer like his father. " We were 0 for 2 on that front. It turns out that the " smart " Bush was n't the one people related to -- as a nation, we preferred the baseball-loving, brush-clearing, **28;1067;TOOLONG. <p> More people liked Bush because even though he has two Ivy League degrees, they saw the " common " man in him, and that made them connect with him in a Dr. Phil sort of way. <p> People also related to Barack Obama in spite of his Harvard degree because he, too, had a good dose of the " everyman " in his life story -- son of a single mom from middle America who struggled with his identity and did n't have things just handed to him on a platter. <p> We know what it 's like to be on a tight budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care, let alone college tuition.... We know what it 's like to work union jobs, to be blue-collar, white-collar, to have our kids in public schools. We felt our very normalcy, our status as ordinary Americans, could be a much-needed fresh breeze blowing into Washington, D.C. <p> Plus there are still plenty of women who are smarting over Hillary Clinton 's loss and who just might vote for Palin if she 's the candidate in 2012 because they do n't want to wait one more second to see a woman in charge of the Oval Office. Now, she even thinks she 's smart enough to be President! <p> Do n't laugh too hard! Democrats are n't doing such a bang up job at the moment -- they 're dragging their feet on Paycheck Fairness, throwing reproductive health under the bus and we still are n't further on paid sick days even though we 're all spreading the swine flu to each other like wildfire. <p> Palin is a wily one so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 's got something else on her agenda. I 'm betting that being President is a little too much real work for her and that she 's angling for something else. <p> My official prediction is that Palin wants Michael Steele 's job as head of the Republican National Committee. Even though Steele has taken his share of jabbing and is n't the most effective one, the position of RNC Chair can be an extremely powerful position -- maybe even more powerful than President when it comes to selecting candidates for races around the country. Plus, you do n't have to worry about all those pesky voters, campaign debates and whistle-stop tours! One of the most important roles of a party chair is to be fundraiser-in-chief and that 's something that Palin has proven she excels at. <p> As much as many would like to dismiss her from the national stage( myself included), Palin is n't going quietly. Whether you like her or not, one has to acknowledge the power in that. Whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other political plum, she 'll definitely have plenty of pocket change to look for a pied-a-terre in the <h> Comments <p> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. <p> Irrelevant? McCain can only wish because she is a player and he helped put her on the field. <p> I think you 've hit on it when you mentioned that Palin is wily but that being president is probably too much work. People like to talk about how dumb she is but I think the truth is closer to lazy. She has used charm and looks and an ability to manipulate people to get by until now, so why fix a winning formula? <p> She is not going anywhere. Things can easily get worse economically( bad debt abounds and the dollar is no sure thing for starters). We have no idea what Obama is really up to on the war front as he gave himself plenty of leeway to change his mind. And it is more and more clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as to get female voters to throw Clinton under the bus. <p> I totally agree with you, and agree with the previous poster in that Palin is not dumb, and maybe not even lazy, I think she wants the easy, cheap ride. She is definitely one to be wary of.
