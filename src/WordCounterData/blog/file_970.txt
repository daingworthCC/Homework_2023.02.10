5206041 <h> Culture Rebel <p> There was a season in my life when the torment of shame ruled me. Everything I did, I thought I was wrong. I felt misjudged, questioned myself repeatedly, worried that I was unaware of a character in me that was untrue. I would scrutinize every action, constantly questioning my integrity in every motive. I was under my own microscope. I assumed the worst of myself on most occasions. What a sick, twisted way of thinking. <p> I did this, because I felt others would judge me, so I determined to beat them to it. A series of tragic events kept happening in my life, making me believe God, Himself was angry with me. I would shame myself, hopefully so I would be spared His anger. I beat myself up day after day, assuming that 's what He wanted me to do. It would take seven years to understand this was far from truthful thinking. <p> I remember the day I broke. I had had it. Enough was enough, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go. What did I let go of?..... control. <p> My problem was n't just the shame I was carrying, it was control. I felt misjudged, so I took control of my situation and determined to do to myself what I felt others wanted to do to me. By doing this, I could take that power away from them. I wanted to do the same to God as well ; take away His power to shame me. <p> Unfortunately, that control I thought I had was destroying me. It put on me misery that was never meant for me to carry. That 's what people who carry shame do ; take the matter into their own hands. They try so hard to be the person they want to be, but when they come up short, they beat themselves so " God does n't have to ". <p> Friends, if you are in this state, I pray that it does n't take you seven years, or even seven days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see, shame tells us that we are worthless, and all that we believe comes from THAT place. If I believe I 'm worthless and believe others and God see me that way, then there 's no way out of living up to that expectation, no matter how hard we try. Its an unending circle of feeling valueless, trying to prove to self and others that you are indeed worthy, only to find you can not win -- repeat cycle, each time sinking more into shame 's clutches. <p> So what happened? Is that what you 're wondering? How did I get over this? Well, the truth is that it is a continual, conscience decision for me to not go back there. I could very easily sink back into this mental state, as it is so closely tied with being an approval addict. <p> Here are some snippets of my journey out of shame 's lair. <p> - I had to get to the bottom before I realized I had created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally knew it. <p> - I had to embrace the fact that there was no possible way I could be in charge of my emotions, actions and will. I was playing God.... and failing, which was only feeding the shame. <p> - I had to let go of all my control that was guarding me. As I allowed my wall to crumble, I was so fearful of God 's punishing hand I expected to come down on me, but instead, I found His love and grace surround me in such a tangible way I just crumbled into His arms. I was so wrong about Him. He was n't going to condemn me, He was there the whole time ready and willing to forgive me for my foolishness. <p> - I had to make a choice every day to believe what He said was true about me : that I 'm loved and accepted freely by Him. This is still a daily choice. Our minds have more to do with our freedom than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring about others ' judgments of me. I had to choose to live out of God 's love and acceptance in moments of feelings others opinions of my intentions. <p> Friends, shame is not something you were meant to carry. I truly believe if you let go of that control you 're trying to have over your life in the name of shame, you 'll be
