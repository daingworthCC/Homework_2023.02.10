This is the ' 60s is a unique multimedia blend of live music, historical film clips, dance, fashion, and animation. More than a stage show, and much more than a concert, This is the ' 60s takes the audience on a cultural journey celebrating the 50th anniversary of so many milestones in news, pop culture, and music history.

Performed live with no pre-recorded samples, the two hour-plus show features the skill and versatility of seven seasoned performers whose note-for-note recreations of classic songs promises to keep audiences captivated. <p> This unique show is the brainchild of producer/director Jim Duffy, a veteran documentary filmmaker, author and musician who has created programming for Discovery Network and other national media outlets. " I combined the two elements I love most : music and storytelling, " explains Duffy. " This is the ' 60s takes the audience on a journey -- one that 's designed to entertain, educate, and stimulate.
