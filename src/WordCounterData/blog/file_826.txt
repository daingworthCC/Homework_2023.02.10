5191441 <p> The conference that many of us just went to is called the MySQL Conference and Expo, but a lot of people do n't call it that. They call it by the name it had in 2006 and earlier : MySQL User 's Conference. In fact, some people say( or blog) that they dislike the new name and they 're going to call it the old name, because... insert reason here.... <p> I call it by the new name that some people dislike so much. Why? Because it is a conference and expo, not a user 's conference. There 's no reason to pretend otherwise. The conference is organized and owned by MySQL, not the users. It is n't a community event. It is n't about you and me first and foremost. It 's about a company trying to successfully build a business, and other companies paying to be sponsors and show their products in the expo hall. Times have changed. <p> I 'm not saying any of this is bad. Being successful in business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine too. I 'm just pointing out that trying to make it be a user 's conference, just by calling it one, is n't going to work. <p> If community members want a community conference, we 'll have to make one. MySQL/Sun can not do this for us, because then it would n't be a community conference. <p> There 's a simple test of whether people want this : if it happens, then the community wanted it badly enough to do something about it. <p> The PostgreSQL East 2008 conference I went to a few weeks ago was a great example of how this works. And the attendance fee was $75, not thousands. A conference does n't have to be expensive. <p> I was n't able to go this year because my new employer did n't want to pay the thousands of dollars it would have cost to send me. I 'm all for the community conference. Anyhow have great organizational skills and a bit of time on their hands? <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sponsors are not a bad thing, they need not have an effect on the program or the community focus. It just needs to be clear. OSDC in Brisbane did this, and had pretty much 50/50 attendee and sponsorship funding. Attendee cost was approx $300 which included food during all days, and conference dinner for everybody. It can be done. <p> I think it 's important to not have this be an anti-MySQL( company) thing, that 's not the objective. But it would, by its existence, fundamentally change the MySQL conf and expo. The attendee makeup will change beyond what it is now already. It 's good to consider this too. <p> By the way, I call it " MySQL Conf " because it 's nice and short. As someone else noted, the " Users " bit was dropped earlier... and the expo was added. But it 's just an unwieldy name to use casually, that 's the only reason. I otherwise have no objection to using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> We have had a few " unconferences " around MySQL over the years and I think they fit your definition. Many MySQL employees participated, but the events were not specifically organised by the company behind MySQL, they had no exhibitors, and they did n't cost a lot( in fact, they were free as in free of charge). <p> I will here and now express my support for such events. But although I represent the corporate entity behind MySQL, I hope that you and others do n't see my support as an attempt to change the notion of " by, for, and of the community ". <p> I 've been thinking about this same thing for the last couple of weeks, since I could n't attend this year. One of the ideas I 've been brainstorming is creating a user conference in Second Life. I was thinking it would be database agnostic, meaning we could do not just MySQL, but all the other open source databases as well. There would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an in person conference. <p> Plenty of technical details to work out, but this could be a global user conference running 24x7 for as many days as we 'd like. It could be very cost effective too, since there 's no flying around, staying/eating in hotels, etc. Simply attend from the comfort of your own computer, wherever you are in the world. <p> I 'd be willing to organize such an event, with the help of experienced Second Life users/members to assist with the technical details. This would clearly meet oby, for, and of the community. <p> It 's a great idea, but I 'm not in a place where I can devote time into being a core organizer of a conference. I can provide logistical support if needed. Conferences do take a lot of time and effort to plan and carry out, and many require cash up front. <p> Also, I am part of Technocation, Inc., a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to provide educational resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets you in doors that might be otherwise closed ; let me know if you want official backing. <p> I also do not believe that you have to take the corporation out of it to be a successful conference that focuses on users. Sun heavily sponsored the New England Database Day, http : **29;5806;TOOLONG as did other companies. <p> I do have plenty of opinions on the matter as well, so if there 's a list, sign me up. :) <p> Baron, as Marten mentioned we have also participated in " un conferences " like the MySQL Camp that we put on twice, once in the bay area and once in New York. Those did n't cost anything and though they had MySQL participation, we simply got the ball rolling. <p> Also the MySQL Conference( by whatever name!) is actually jointly operated by MySQL and O'Reilly. While it is a business( O'Reilly wants to make money off it) we try to run it on a breakeven budget for MySQL, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The name change occurred a couple of years ago and this was based on a suggestion from O'Reilly to showcase the expo. The focus has not changed though and we very much see it as a conference for our users, as well as our partners, our customers and a showcase of what we 're working on. <p> But we 're thrilled if there are other events that also pop up to meet the needs of our community of users. <p> Thanks everyone for your comments. A few follow-up comments, all with " IMO " appended invisibly : <p> I encourage you to join the Google Group Arjen mentioned. <p> Sponsors are good. There were sponsors at the PG conference. What 's important is where the initiative, responsibility, and authority is vested. <p> I 'm not anti-MySQL, but we as a community are too dependent on MySQL. It 's not healthy for anyone. I think MySQL 's management recognize this, which is good. <p> The un-conferences I 've attended( MySQL Camp 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 never happened partially because everyone waited for MySQL to organize it. <p> I would n't be interested in a virtual conference. I 'm virtual all year ; I want to meet people for real. No offense, but I wo n't go near Second Life : -) <p> To Zach 's point, I think the community will need to take responsibility to meet their own needs. <p> More about community in later posts. I 'll close this comment by saying the best thing that happened when I attended the PostgreSQL conference was that it brought the MySQL world into sharp focus for me. It was really eye-opening. <p> I have been involved with a couple of attempts to organize virtual events, always involving people that spend large amounts of time on the computer anyway. They were not fun for me, and I agree that meeting and talking to real people is the real need. We all need to get away
