5109741 <h> Tangents and Vectors <h> An Idea Borrowed <p> Years ago on a radio program someone shared that they read a chapter in Proverbs every day. Since there are 31 chapters and the longest month has 31 days it allows you to read through Proverbs on a regular basis. I use it as the launch pad for my personal worship time and branch out from there. On this blog I will try to share some of the insights I have in the Word. I will try to organize them in the archive by reference. <h> Thursday, November 8, 2012 <h> Take It to the Bank <p>( Proverbs 8:22 KJV) The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. <p> Wisdom is timeless. We believe that there are certain principles that were established by God before the creation. They reflect His nature. God " possessed "( 7069) wisdom. <p> This goes against the teaching of our culture. We live in a time when absolute truth, and wisdom, are rejected. Everything is relative. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are relative. You drive slower in a midnight ice storm than you do on a sunny day. Other things you can take to the bank. Adultery is wrong. Your college professors might disagree but what do they know? <p> This should give us a secure place to stand. Not in arrogance. We are not the ones that are always right, God is. And God has made His teachings clear enough for the simple and complex enough for the scholar. <p> So? Live what you know. Ignore the nonsense as much as you can. Remind yourself, " This, too, shall pass. " <h> Followers <h> Bible Text <p> I prefer the NASB for my study but I will be using the KJV as the text I post. I do this because I do not understand the copyright restrictions. If I ever get a better grasp of the law I may change the text I list. We may be under grace rather than law, but others are not so free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences are. <h> Greek and Hebrew <p> In the comments there will be reference to words and the original languages. Number in parenthesis,( 1235), refer to the number from Strong 's Numbering system. <h> An Invitation <p> The theme of this blog is devotional, worshipful, Biblical. I have a lot of ideas that wo n't fit in that frame so I have started another blog. It is called Medley of Worship. <p> You are invited to visit me there. It includes Bible and theology but also politics, education and anything else that comes to my mind. <h> About Me <p> I have been a serious follower of Jesus Christ since my senior year in high school. I am a Vietnam Veteran who came home more patriotic than I left. I am a graduate of Nazarene Theological Seminary and an ordained elder although I an not currently serving in a pastoral position. I have what I consider an orthodox faith set in the context of Wesley and Arminius. I share this @ @ @ @
