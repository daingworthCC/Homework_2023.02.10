5184841 <h> Back of the Bus <p> She reluctantly sat in the back of the yellow school bus. No seat belts, sticky vinyl bench seats. Last bus stop to pick up the new girl, 11 years old, shy, small and scrawny, forced to take the back seat. How she hated going there. <p> He glanced at the large rear view mirror to check on the ruffians who sat in the very back of the bus as far away as possible from his disapproving eyes. What a crappy job he thought, school bus driver. Hauling pigs was easier. At least they did n't talk back or throw spit balls at the back of his head while he was driving. <p> The diesel motor huffed along, spewing noxious black smoke and malodorous fumes when he, Bert Monroe pushed on the gas pedal to mount the gravel hill on the country road. Thankfully the last pick up and stop before the town of Cranberry Flats and the school. Now he could cruise, only 15 minutes out, no more kids to collect, just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lot ' he thought ahead. Wish I had the chutes at the other end and the cattle prod or livestock cane in hand. That would make the unloading much more efficient. Those boys would fall into line quick enough. Just one jolt, even a touch with 40 volts could do wonder for Jordan 's manners. If only his parents would try some, any discipline. Spoiled brat. <p> Bouncing on the driver 's seat, steering expertly in control, Bert deftly danced the colossal school bus around potholes, debris and dolts. Bert simmered with his continuous inner complaints. Stupid drivers coming over hills in the middle of the road with their fancy SUV 's. Gravel roads, you dummies -- do n't ya like yer paint jobs? Fools every darned one of them, driving faster than it 's safe on country roads. ' membered when I seen one moron drive into the ditch with his dumb ass cell phone plastered to his ear. There 's reality for you, a honking big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the right-of-way. Physics, mass, velocity, time. Flaming dumbo city transplants with money and little brain power or common sense. It 's not your road, it 's mine. Bert drove 50 mph and more when he could proficiently dodge the pot holes and maneuver between the gravel shoulders, gravel piled up ready to grab unsuspecting vehicles that drifted too close. <p> Two miles out, he heard a noise and looked up in the rear view mirror to see the quiet new girl being picked on by Jordan, junior football player, 13 years old, growing feet already slopped into size 13 Nikes, 5 ' 10 ", a muscular 150lbs of mean bully. Poor little gal, I 'll have to do something about that. He checked to see that only Jordan was up out of his seat. <p> Bert slammed on the brakes hard. <p> Jordan fell down hard, real hard, dazed. The kids laughed, many of them Jordan bullied in past bus trips. <p> The @ @ @ @
