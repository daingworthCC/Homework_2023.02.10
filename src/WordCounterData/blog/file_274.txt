5135541 <p> Today, Steph says : " Also bought 3 rosarita beans and 3 classico as part of the buy 10 deal, and I got a $1 cat from Heinz. Not sure what triggered it. " Then SoapboxTray put it together from a Catalina alert at Meijer, that must probably also be at Jewel.( The below says 10/27, but monthly Cats would usually run through Sunday 10/28? hmm) <p> janpritts noticed : " I 'm looking at the smart ones desserts... thinking buying 2 at a time( with the barilla pasta deal you posted today)... if you buy 2 at a time then they come out to 37 cents each after 2.25 catalina.... better than buying the 10 at a time price. Just FYI for someone that needs to add 2 more items to their order to get to 10 items. " <p> What was that pasta deal again? <p> Barilla pasta is on the buy ten, save $5.00 instantly sale at Jewel this week, at $.75 each when you buy ten mix/match items. Jill Cataldo reports that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale, and there 's a $1.00/2 coupon in the 10/21 SS you can use to drop these to just $.25 a box. <p> Update from Steph on additional included varieties : " The coupon is good for the " white fiber " variety, and the veggie and whole grain varieties as well( in the wording and the picture this time!). I used it on 2 veggie and 2 whole grain with no problem. " <p> But a warning from Christine : " The Barilla white fiber boxes are 12 oz boxes, not a full pound of pasta. Tricky, tricky packaging! " <p> So a buy ten mix/match/mashup idea <p> Let 's see if we can get up to 10 here -- prices shown after instant savings when you buy 10 mix/match items : <p> Buy one more small item to fill out your 10 participating items requirement, such as a Fuze or Powerade for $.50. <p> Pay $8.85 after coupons. <p> Get back $3.25 OYNO( $2.25 from Weight Watchers and $1.00 from Classico) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and you have a couple of pasta dinners + dessert! <p> Again, the Catalinas only go through 10/27 or 10/28, so you only have a couple more days for the deal. <p> Campbell 's soup <p> Kitty got a Catalina alert : " Buy any select Campbell 's condensed soups( excluding great for cooking varieties) between 10-29-12 and 11-25-12 and save up to $2.50 OYNO : Buy 5 or 6 get $1.50, Buy 7 or 8 get $2.00, Buy 9 or nore get $2.50? At Jewel through Wed : <h> Comments <p> I bought 3 Classicos as part of the 10 deal and only got back 75 cents in a Cat at Jewel today. I got 2 red ones and 1 white. I guess they do n't count the light alfredo sauce since it is a smaller jar? It counted towards the 10 and the $1 off 3 coupon worked. <p> I just looked on the Cat ad I got from Jewel and it even shows a picture of the smaller, white jar! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site it is not still listed as a Cat for Jewel? Did the Classico deal end today? I was wanting to go back and get another set of 10 tomorrow. BY THE WAY.... those Smart Ones desserts are good! I 'm getting 2 more tomorrow. <p> I think the light might just not be in the system properly. I got to alfredo( not light, ha!), a red, and a pesto, and I got the $1.50. Definitely contact Catalina... and you 'll probably just get another $1 coupon, since they never seem to see the message part where I tell them I got something
