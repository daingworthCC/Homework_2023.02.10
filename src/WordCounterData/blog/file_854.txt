5194341 <p> Dan Froomkin has taken note of a pathetic and disgusting attack on Americans of Somali origin who chose to vote early in Ohio. <p> Under the fat, bold headline IS VOTER FRAUD BEING COMMITTED IN OHIO? and a subsequent article, Human Events -- the ultra-rightist Washington, D.C.-based publication that gave Paul Ryan its " Conservative of the Year " award in 2011 -- claimed that carloads of Somalis were taken to polls in Columbus and told how to vote by " Democrat " operatives even though there was no way to tell if they were citizens. GOP poll watchers interviewed by the publication also claim the Democrats did some of their work inside the 100-foot radius that defines the no-politicking line. <p> Froomkin quoted the head of a Somali-American association who was upset over the implication that these early voters were cheating. Omar Hassan said : " That 's the American dream ; exercising the freedom of voting.... This is scare tactics, to be honest with you. " <p> Ben Piscitelli, a spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections, mocked the concerns expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these Somalis, who knows if they 're U.S. citizens? Who knows what Somali pollworkers are saying to them? Gee, we saw Democrats outside that were giving them slate cards. ' <p> " The answer to all of that is : So what? " Piscitelli said. <p> A foaming screed on the subject appeared at the conservative website American Thinker, which describes itself as devoted to " thoughtful exploration of issues. " Under the byline Jeannie DeAngelis was written : <p> If Democrats choose to forego raising the eligibility issue with, let 's say, busloads of Somali voters, then any illegal Somali votes will still be counted on Election Day. <p> Nonetheless, being a global citizen and all, regardless of the ensuing crisis Barack Obama has consistently attempted to maintain a spirit of camaraderie with the Muslim world, and that world includes Somalia.... <p> Who would have thought that almost 20 years later some of the Somalis who may have jeered as the American soldiers ' burnt and desecrated bodies were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those voting in the swing state of Ohio? <p> And so it seems that with nary a whisper of apprehension concerning potential election fraud from the Obama White House, Ohio Democrats have decided to emulate Somali pirates and attempt to hijack the election. <p> Yowser. Danged thoughtful that exploration. <p> The fundamental fear of the suppressors of voting has been the same throughout our history. It 's all bundled in their view that some people -- the other, the different, the black and brown and yellow and red, the poor -- do n't deserve the right to vote and every effort should be made to keep them from doing so. The Ohio Somalis? How could they possibly be legitimate voters when their erstwhile countrymen killed American soldiers two decades ago? What the hell, goes the subtext, are they even doing in this country in the first place? Up to no good, obviously, with their alien religion and bad English. And helped along by a president who himself is alien, other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norman Rockwell version that seems to animate these rancid, hyperventilating promoters of xenophobia and myth. Were it up them, the Statue of Liberty would have been designed as a pair, holding between them a huge chain across New York Harbor and a big bronze sign : " Hey, you huddled masses tag from " education ". A tag like " reform " alone is probably not meaningful. <p>( surname of Italian origin) should be concerned about her mob ties here and abroad. Maybe think about how many got " two to the hat " by one of her relatives or ancestors. How many G men they murdered. <p> See how that works, Jeannie? Just using your pea brained assumptions to come to a conclusion about you and your family. <p> I really ca n't stomach racists because they are like the plague without antibiotics. If we had a sane Congress, the Constitution is whole ; it is complete ; it is total. " Barbara Jordan, 1974 <p> other human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them. <p> " The great lie of democracy, essential paradox, is that democracy is the first to be sacrificed when its security is at risk. Every state is totalitarian at heart ; there are no ends to the cruelty it will go -- Ian McDonald <p> " The great lie of democracy, essential paradox, is that democracy is the first to be sacrificed when its security is at risk. Every state is totalitarian at heart ; there are no ends to the cruelty it will go to to protect itself. " -- Ian McDonald <p> Its a state of mind, an emotional condition more than anything, IMHO. And, it spreads like a viral infection, I feel. Turns people into forms of mindless, garbage-fed zombies with regards to how they process views of themselves and others. <p> With that perspective in mind, I feel equally sorry and horrified by people who are in its grip - especially since self-cure is often possible( but, not always easily achieved if their primary contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are human. But, some degree of zombie, as well. It is sometimes difficult to find the rational person beneath their unfortunate disease symptoms. <p> " So, please stay where you are. Do n't move and do n't panic. Do n't take off your shoes! Jobs is on the way. " <p> that the GOP is laying the groundwork to light up a fake voter fraud storm after they lose. Part of it is this determination to make people think the election is close, or even better, that Romney is way ahead and will win handily. They have done well on this part already. A lot of people are going to be surprised when Obama wins, even though to anyone looking at the objective data, it wo n't be. Then they are putting out these suggestions about voter fraud in early voting - this story, there was another diary about Fox claiming multiple( completely undocumented) issues with electronic voting chosing Obama even when Romney is selected and I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They plan to try to delegitimize Obama 's win and use it to push through more voter suppression laws. <p> This is their common pattern - first accuse your opponent of what you 're planning on doing, then you can say ' THEY denied OUR charges, now accusing us is just payback! '. <p> Getting ready for massive R fraud in 5 days and counting. <p>( romney) /RYAN 2012 - My fellow Americans - as a boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But now I say, we must move forward ; not backward. Upward ; not forward. And always twirling, twirling, twirling towards Freedom! <p> in other states, it was " busloads " of union members coming to town. in some states, someone calls radio station to report " busloads " of some group that is being shipped into the area to vote. <p> From an earlier diary i wrote : <p> The proof of the voter identity fraud is then based on a mythical bus that appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be Harry Potter 's invisible Knight Bus, because no one can prove it exists. The bus has been repeatedly cited by True the Vote, a national group focused on voter fraud. Catherine Engelbrecht, the group 's leader, told a gathering in July about buses carrying dozens of voters showing up at polling places during the recent Wisconsin recall election. <p>... Weeks later, another True the Vote representative told a meeting of conservative women about a bus seen at a San Diego polling place in 2010 offloading people " who did not appear to be from this country. " <p> Officials in both San Diego and Wisconsin said they had no evidence that the buses were real. " It 's so stealthy that no one is ever able to get a picture and no one is able to get a license plate, " said Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin agency that oversees elections. In some versions the bus is from an Indian reservation ; in others it is full of voters from Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said. <p> Earth provides enough to satisfy every man 's need, but not every man 's greed. Mohandas K. Gandhi <p> The early voting center is located in the Northland neighobrhood, home to 30,000 Somali refugees as well as thousands of immigrants from many other African countries. These are the residents of the neighborhood and most of them are just taking a pleasant stroll down to the voting center. <p> Here 's what happened : Paranoid wingnut who lives in his basement in some shitty west Columbus suburb drove to northeast Columbus and was shocked to see that the largest metropolitan area in Ohio is a bit more diverse than he imagined. Panicked. Wrote a racist rant to explain away the reality that will get Obama reeelected. <p> busloads of people noone knew. I 'm not sure where the people were from - the buses had Massachusetts plates, but they must have had to search a little bit to find Romney voters in Mass. that were willing to make the trip. <p> Given how rabid some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns, who is to say what they might hope for. <p> Look how Fox has been on Benghazi damn near 24/7. Switch that around to " Muslims " taking over and these wild eyed nuts who have been itching for a fight and a real firestorm could be ignited. <p> The hate out there is insane and the people who occupy it are just as insane in my book. They will say any lie no matter how outrageous, so now the question becomes ; will they resort to other measures, once thought improbable? <p> " We can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we ca n't have both. " Louis Brandeis <p> limbaugh ca n't be that wrong or his **28;2299;TOOLONG ' suffers. that means he has to have an excuse lined up and that makes sense. obama stole the election. <p> i hope it has to do with more voter suppression laws and not a bunch of election theft. the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it coming would make it unlikely that guys like toe sucker and limbaugh would be let in on it officially so hopefully they 're just setting up the next few years for a lot of election theft accusations and more suppression, and he 's not the president shit. <p> on the other hand it might help make the case for investigating the machines, etc., which they would n't want. <p> This is a list of 76 universities for Rush Limbaugh that endorse global warming denial, racism, sexism, and partisan lying by broadcasting sports on Limbaugh radio stations. <p> never been a poll worker of any kind. Racism and xenophobia aside, do they really think it 's that goddamned easy to just show up to a polling place and place a fraudulent vote? That 's an insult to poll workers and election officials, both Democratic AND Republican. <p> And I immediately wondered how these bus-loaded hoardes of Democratically brain-washed persons somehow were already on the registered voter list at the polls. <p> Because I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them access to the machines w/o checking the rolls, first. <p> Could it be that they are all duly-enrolled citizen electors, aka legitimate voters? Ya think? <p> Sheesh - I 'm with the Franklin County BOE official in mocking the people who would be dumb enough to believe this absurd fairy tale. If lack of intelligence was a disqualifying factor for being a voter then a good whack of conservative voters would have already been struck from the votor lists.( Hey, a girl can dream, right?) <p> As an election clerk, I agree with Araguato. If the local party genuinely thinks non-citizens and unregistered people from " away "( overseas or over the county line or whatever) are being allowed to vote, there 's a procedure for that : Have an official poll-watcher who has the list and checks people off as they come in, and has the right to challenge someone who is not on the list or is not the person whose name is there or whatever. <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), one D and one R( or independent), working together checking people in. <p> Otherwise this is just making up stories to create a narrative -- ACORN is n't around, so they had to tweak the narrative about the armies of scary dark-skinned outsiders who Obama has hired to steal the election for him. <p> I do n't think that Ms. DeAngelis understands that during the 1910s and ' 20s, eugenicist racists like Madison Grant, worried about the " wrong " kind of immigrants, were saying pretty much what she 's writing about Ms. DeAngelis 's own immigrant ancestors. <p> That 's America, and a fifth freedom. Freedom to hate people who are different from you. We do it very, very well. <p> -7.75, -8.10 ; All it takes is security in your own civil rights to make you complacent, and we are all Wisconsin. <p> is in the middle of a neighborhood loaded with African immigrants. In fact, it 's just across the street from a really great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Somali-Americans voting early, they should take it up with whoever chose the location for the early voting center, not the people who chose to walk down the street and exercise their rights. <p> In order to register, you need more than just a photo ID -- You also need proof of citizenship and residency. <p> People have gotten convinced that the " photo ID at the polls " is the line of defense against non-citizens voting illegally. It is n't. Here in RI, a janitor with a photo ID from his job can meet the ID requirement( so would a green card, I think, if it has a photo -- it 's a US government document) -- but would n't be allowed to register if he 's not a US citizen. <p> There is a deliberate confusion of these issues, and there is a low-information poor-thinking too-much-Fox-News confusion. <p> after the President wins re-election there will be shrill voices on Fox and in other conservative media claiming widespread fraud in NJ and NY aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President 's re-election is illegitimate because of this. Not a one of these shrill voices or the **25;2329;TOOLONG who will swallow it will stop to think that the President would have won these states storm or not. <p> every election we hear and get the same thing from the republicans. Here is the deal, if you are not white, then they go into panic mode and claim " voter fraud ". Every election, every one of them, there is a " complaint " filed with the attorney general in South Dakota. Every election, he " investigates " under a formal declaration and every election there is not a damn thing that is not correct. This dog will not hunt and yet they drag it out so that there is a mark against the whole election priviledge if they think the race is a close one. I, for one, do not believe that the Somalis nor the Latinos nor the Native Americans nor anyone would vote the way they claim. If these folks came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the name on the side of the bus? Did n't happen, just more stench from a dying corpse of a political party, the GOP, Damn shame too. <p> assume most of these non-white voters would be Native American, if that 's the case how do they justify these claims? This is n't like the with the case here when the people being( without any evidence) suspected of voter fraud are actually foreigners. If there is not chance of that what could they bitch about? <p> " The government of the many, not the government of the money " - Nancy Pelosi <p> it is all smoke and mirrors. What happens is that it is all about voter registration. A few years back, the race was between Stephanie Herseth and a Republican opponent. I allowed a student from an East Coast university to stay at my home for campaign help to help get her elected. What this young man would do, is to notarize signatures to register these voters on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pissed republicans off. Some months after the election, an FBI agent came to my door and asked me about this young man and what his interest was doing the job he was doing. I asked why he was checking this out after the election. The agent told me that they had a question about one signature( of hundreds) that was notarized and they wanted to get in touch with the volunteer. One signature, months after the election, what the hell? So that is why this " voter fraud " is bullshit. This is only meant to intimidate and only meant to make it more difficult to use your rights as an American to vote and to participate in " democracy ". The voters on the reservation are a huge amount of people for this state. The problem is they are poor and lack transportation to the community centers where the vote takes place and lack the resources to register as well. <p> By making this difficult and to intimidate those who assist, the republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowing Americans to freely cast their votes and let the cards fall where they may. If the republicans can not win an election honestly, maybe they should change their message. <p> in 2010 about " busloads of union workers " being " shipped in " to vote for Harry Reid. <p> Yeah. <p> Legal Nevada voters, 100% fully registered and with their voters guides imprinted with a unique bar code and a label showing their current legal Nevada address via their voter registration card on file, who happened to be union members, were provided with transportation to go and legally vote in Las Vegas. <p> AHHHHHHHH. Scandal? Whatever. <p> Yes. Partisan GOTV efforts are... partisan. If I want to turn out Obama voters, I... show up in my car with a group of Obama voters. Duh. <p> How racist does the GOP have to get? How bad? <p> Do we actually need " True the Vote " goons to show up in Klan robes? Burn a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America is that in-person voter fraud is a pretty much a total fucking myth. A fairy tale that is being treated far, far too seriously by our nearly fucking useless political press out of fear of bad faith Movement Conservative attacks about " liberal bias " if they do n't play ball and treat a fantasy as a real issue. <p> The Right could not do what it does if they did n't have people pulling an Uppem who are supposed to be walking a wall. <p>( Uppem being the translator from " Saving Private Ryan " who pretty much frozen in terror allowed his fellow soldier to be brutally killed when he could have done his job and saved the man.) <p> The entire Movement Conservative Ratfuck and Disenfranchisement Machine needs to be enabled, coddled, and given a pass to work to its full potential. <p> I do n't know how anybody who works in political journalism can look at how the 2012 race has been covered and be proud of their profession. <p> This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a details free campaign, and what " facts " he gave out were almost either all lies, entirely based on fake numbers, puffery, and bullshit, it was not a secret at all that this was his campaign, and he was viable to win the White House the whole way. <p> If a Somalian-American is taken to the polls, and he or she is a legal voter, where is the scandal? <p> If a Movement Conservative accuses people of committing fraud merely because their evidence is that they are black or brown and voting... so it 's fraud? Wow. Now, that should be a major scandal. <p> I am from the Elizabeth Warren and Darcy Burner wing of the Democratic Party <p> These motherfuckers only understand the political bloody nose. That 's it. They will do what they do until they can not do it any longer because they have been politically knocked on their asses. <p> There is no excuse for any Democratic office-holder or official to claim to be ' surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point. <p> The whole motherfucker runs on ratfucking, disenfranchisement, and abuse of the system and of office. <p> Nobody has the abiliity to claim they did n't know about this shit anymore. This is what the Right does. <p> We need, as a party, as a movement, to make them pay a painful price for their racism and their dirty tricks. <p> As far as I am concerned, they should be afraid to do this shit. Politically, I 'm not implying we should use violence against the Right, I am saying that we should retaliate. <p> Like suing to make Voter IDs that are mandatory automatically free, else, they are a poll tax. <p> The Wingnut governors and legislators lose revenue and fees, things that they hike to avoid raising taxes, and its a good way to make mandatory IDs more accessable and hit the wingnuts in the wallet who do this kind of shit. <p> I am from the Elizabeth Warren and Darcy Burner wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation, in our government and in our courts, claiming that systemic racism does n't exist anymore and thus there is no need for affirmative action. Yet, when a busload of black people show up to vote, we hear screams of outrage that " those people " are allowed to vote and are " stealing the election ". And not just any black people, immigrant black people. Oh, the perfidy! Next up, blinding obvious conclusion, we do n't live in a post-racist society. <p> America was and is just like the Norman Rockwell painting in some places. Like Utah. To this day. That 's what many blue staters do n't really understand. <p> Of course, behind every Normal Rockwell painting was all of the pain and repression of the Leave it to Beaver model, but the fact is that it 's there. <p> It 's there in some red states( again, Utah) today. WTF does everyone think they 're looking at when they lock at the Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why the far-right areas are so rabid. Because in Utah, for example, they 're still living in an all-white, **34;2356;TOOLONG, **40;2392;TOOLONG... universe. <p> And they see it shrinking. <p> The worry is precisely that if the blue states ' America continues, one of the kids might decide that it 's okay to be openly gay or to marry across racial lines ; one of the wives might decide that it 's okay to have an opinion or even a job ; some of the families might start listening to world music instead of hymns ; neighborhood christmas exchanges might start to include donations to UNICEF on behalf of receiving families instead of baby-jesus-shaped fruitcakes with Bible quotes attached to them. <p> refugee immigrants, making it the second largest Somali immigrant community in America, behind Minneapolis. This community has been here for approximately 20 years, immigrated legally, many have become US Citizens, many are US Citizens by birth, and many are quite legally registered voters. <p> Many of the Somali immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, many are Muslim and some are likely to be other religions, but I have no way of knowing that for sure. <p> And at least some of the Somali immigrants who are registered voters have every right to visit the Early Voting Center and to be transported by buses. <p> We can expect a large number of Souls to the Polls voters to visit the Early Voting Center when it opens up at 2:00 PM on Sunday as well. Most of these non-white voters are Christians. <p> Ohioans are aware of Radical Right voter suppression efforts and we are prepared to deal with it in each of Ohio 's 88 counties. We wo n't be denied our RIGHT to vote. <p> polls of all places and take a chance of getting deported? What a bunch of scat brains. The undocumented are in hiding and their names want be on the voter rolls with addresses, which means they took a chance to register, so law enforcement can drive up and pick them up. Racial fear and hate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the picture at an allowed host first - I use Imageshack because it takes all of 5 seconds to upload there, and I do n't need an account. Imageshack provides the html code. This code will also link back to Imageshack, but you can easily remove it if you know a little html. <p> You can also hand code it : <p> img src= " yourpic.jpg " inside &lt; &gt; <p> Or you can click the link button below your diary or comment, paste the location of your pic( i.e., imageshack " direct link ") and check the " image " checkbox. This will automatically insert " img src " html code described above. <p> I 'm glad I 'm not the only one that caught the irony of " Norman Rockwell America ". XD <p> I 'm glad you 're not the only one either. I 've always loved that painting. It 's especially poignant when you see the clip of the now grown little girl standing next to Obama and looking at the @ @ @ @ @
