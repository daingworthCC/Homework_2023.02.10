5128541 <h> 26 August 2009 <h> weddings i would like to attend : 1 <p> i know those hearts are going to make a few of you feel a wee bit nauseated, but if you recall from a long, long time ago i ca n't help myself when it comes to the giant red blobs of ink. <p> oh and their invitation was a poster( i ca n't post it here due to some silly computer problems but you can see it here). i am so ready to have a client come to me and ask for a wedding invitation poster, in fact, i am so ready that i might be willing to do it at a pretty heft discount... ahem,
