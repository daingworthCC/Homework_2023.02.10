 Once again, thanks for sharing your story, One of the many I hear withing the Arab community <h> Niyati <p> I 'm appalled and horrified and enraged at this. Thank you for sharing this. <p> You 've written such a measured, sane account of it... Salute! <p> p.s. I 'm Indian and was profiled( not as drastically) once at De Gaulle airport ; and shrugged it off... I joked later with my family that the powers that be thought that staid old boring me was a dangerous Mata Hari. <p> I do n't know you and I ca n't tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family, and you have to decide what is a priority for you. But as an American citizen OUTRAGED by what has happened to you, I hope that you, and others who are reading this, do n't let this go, do n't try to rationalize or defend the actions of the airline or TSA, and do n't stop making yourselves heard. This is how totalitarian states work. People are encouraged to report on their fellow citizens, innocent people are randomly branded enemies of the state, and everybody lives in fear of the midnight knock on the door. This is not East Berlin. This is not Tehran. This is not Pyongyang, This happened in Detroit, and that should make a difference. <h> a <p> This story tore me apart. I am from Michigan, and knowing I could someday fly out of Detroit makes me wonder what could they think of me? Why do people plot others of a different ethnicity? You clearly did nothing wrong, but we all know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly sorry for what happened to you, and I hope that this was not just a bad experience, but a time for you to remember that everyone is the same, someone should not be labeled by race or gender, but should be accepted just for being YOU! You seem like a wonderful person, and stay strong, and do n't dwell on the experience, just think down on those bastards who thought you were " suspicious " and hope that someday karma will come back and bite them on the ass. <p> i completely understand what you went through. I have quite a bit of Arab blood in my family and I do n't like traveling because of this. It makes it much more difficult to get on an airplane and although I 've never been detained like you have, it 's always been a major worry of mine. <p> Also, what they did is n't right. Some people just get paranoid and think they see things that do n't actually take place, and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of trouble in the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt. " -- Bertrand Russel <h> Your fellow citizen <h> Katrina <p> what happened to you is awful. However unfortunately people of similar ethnic background to you have been conspiring to kill innocent people, in the most cruel way. It is completely unfair on you, but you can not blame the general public of growing resentment towards the arabs. Not only do these people kill others, they kill their own kind too. Had there actually been 3 terrorists on the plane, everyone including you would be grateful for the action homeland security take. Terrorists do nt make themselves obvious, so how do you fight an invisible enemy?! There is only one way I can think of, by assuming that all people that fit the description are the enemy. Its a case of damned if you do, and damned if you do nt. Yes it violating, yes its racist, yes its not fair, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists travel around the country, i think so <h> s. <p> are you trained in identifying terrorists? do you have any proof that racial profiling works? are you aware that many of the biggest instances of terrorism in the united states have been carried out by people of similar ethnic background to WHITE people? you appear to have considered none of these things. perhaps think a little harder before you post. <h> Katrina <p> s., no one is trained in identifying terrorists, so how would you do it? what is the alternative to racial profiling? I think you are to quick with your insults, if I was writting an article on the topic maybe your argument would be valid, but my short post was to encourage an alternative view point, for people to see that this not just a racist attack on human rights, but the result of a serious wound inflicted on the american people, by people mostly of a middle eastern origin. I do nt deny that WHITE people can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in a thesis on sociology which is not an option here. But in the case of 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afganistan and the media portrayal.... the average person can not be blamed to be anxious in the presence of certain ethnicities. <h> s. <p> actually, they can be blamed. we call it racism. when terrorism that has happened in our country has been conducted by both people of " certain ethnicities " and by people who are white, yet you are only anxious in the presence of those people who do not look like you, that would be racism. <p> as to being trained to identify terrorists, that actually IS what some people are trained to do. if we were a wiser country, we might spend more dollars on that than on scrambling F-16s every time the " average " citizen becomes " anxious in the presence of certain ethnicities. " <h> Katrina <p> if we lived in Ireland at the time of the IRA bombings, I am sure we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then white males acting suspiciously would be held up for questioning. Its not so much racism, its stereotyping of groups in relation to threats these types of people have caused. If it was white women that flew those planes into the world trade center, and blew themselves us in markets in Iraq, then it would be white women that are always under suspicion. Yes, its wrong to be picking on a race just because they have blue or green or brown eyes, that is a violation. This is not what are talking about here. If a particular race is continuously responsible for certain threats, then all the people in that race will be stereotyped by their behavior, it just human mature. We are all guilty of stereotyping ie judging a person by their appearance. Unfortunately for the arabs, other arabs have inflicted serious wounds on the Western society in recent times. Until all the terrorist attacks are mostly done by whites( which is not very likely to happen) unfortunately we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that people should not be treated like this woman has. Detain for questioning yes. Being escorted of the plane at gun point and strip searched no. I would love to know what you solution to the problem would be. Before you start insulting people for their views, perhaps provide an alternative solution to the problem that works. I do nt necessarily agree with the method, but I do nt know what the alternative would be, so if its going to stop more innocent people dying, perhaps the stereotyping can be forgiven until the day that that type stops blowing people up. <h> Katrina <p> Whats your solution to homeland security Allison? We can all preach human rights, but until we come up with a solution that captures terrorists without confusing innocent people of the same ethnic background, there is not many alternatives. You are right, we do nt actually feel safer. But at least we can not blame them for lax security and not taking reports of suspicious behaviour seriously. Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arabs that crashed airliners into buildings on 9/11? Or maybe the media is to blame, perhaps we have to ask them to stop showing images of the people responsible.... because thats causing racism?! I had a similar experience. I have dark colourings and was questioned in Russia at the time arabs from Chechnya were blowing up residential buildings in Moscow. I completely understand why they questioned me and am not offended because they picked me out because of my dark hair. I totally agree that strip searching is going too far. I would prefer to be questioned every time, then have a school of children taken under siege by suicide bombers( including women terrorists) like it happened in Beslan killing 380 people, ever again! <h> Allison <p> The " we must stop anything from happening ever again! " feeling is understandable, but leads to the violation of Constitutional rights such as what Ms. Shebshi related. The fact that you personally were not offended is not a good enough justification to continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharing an ethnic background with terrorists does not make one a terrorist. If so, then white males should begin to be profiled since Timothy McVeigh was a white male, and the murdered of George Tiller was a white male, and so on. <p> There is a middle ground between having no security, and allowing someone 's Constitutional rights to be violated on the basis of unsubstantiated reports of unspecified suspicious activity made by untrained civilians who are then never held responsible for those reports if they are false. <h> EvilDevil <p> The terrorists win every time we let our fears dictate our behavior. This is appalling.After ten years we have been fooled into the idea that we need to give up what makes us American to keep us safe from " the enemy ". We deserve neither liberty nor security. <h> James Callaghan <p> I got to this from Kurt Busiek 's Twitter post( via Lar deSouza). Ma'am, I 'm not American though I 've lived here for half my life, so I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could. As I am a white, hetrosexual male, maybe I can apologise on behalf of people who will never have to experience this kind of unmitigated nonsense. I assure you the words I want to use are far more profane and lengthily so. I do n't know if that 's worth anything, and it ca n't begin to make up for what you had to endure, but it 's what I have to give. I 'm ashamed and appalled that such things still happen. Not just in America, but on the planet. We should know better. I hope your eloquence here helps to bring about that awareness in others. <h> Mark Frazier <p> The paranoia and fear which has gripped this country has allowed Bin Laden to win. Those who were supposedly " protecting " citizens by this shameful treatment of this woman have played directly into Bin Laden 's hands. The question is, are we going to continue to allow fear, and Bin Laden, to rule our lives? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw up. Thank you for sharing this story. And thanks for the link to the news story. You were also followed by two F-16 fighters. We must do something about this. What, I do n't know. But we have to do something. Because like so many others have said, the terrorists have won. They 've succeeded in dividing us. <p> Why you should NEVER talk to TSA, Homeland Security, or the FBI in this situation : <p> Imagine this : Agent #1 interviews you. You give a full account. Agent #2 interviews you. You give a full account. But some minor, insiginificant details vary, as they would because memory is imperfect. <p> You have now told two " different " accounts to two federal law enforcement agents. You can be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001 for making a false statement to a government official. Farfectched? Well it has happened to a number of Americans of Arab and Asian descent. <h> Ss <p> First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go thru. I feel like there is more to this story than what has been mentioned by you and by the news reports. There had to have been some kind of actions that would cause an entire plane of people and the crew members of this plane to feel some kind of suspicious activity was occurring by the individuals that were arrested including yourself. Also, you and your seat mates i am sure were not the only middle eastern/arab descent people on the plane so why single you and the 2 men out? On a day of heightened security, its not a good time to test the system or draw attention of any kind towards yourself regardless of your ethnicity or nationality. The crew on this plane have flown hundreds of times and with many kinds of people and are well aware of the repercussions that can occur with accusations such as this. They must have had some reason or concern to call this issue in and thus deal with the consequences of themselves and the whole plane being delayed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and who is to be believed? I would really like to hear what the other passengers on the plane had to say vs the words of the accusers and of the accused. The story is starting to become one sided and its hard to know who to believe anymore. I know security at airports has gotten out of control but its there for a reason. I would rather it be there than not be there and unfortunately these things are going to happen over and over again. What about the poor 90 yr old woman who was strip searched at security and was wearing an adult diaper? She wasnt profiled in anyway and I am sure what she went thru was just as humiliating and offensive. Its everyone not just you. <p> I have often wondered if the " 90 year old white woman " strip search was n't done deliberately, specifically for the agencies involved to be able to say, " No we do n't profile, we randomly search everyone -- have n't you heard about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, no WAY we would have selected her to search if it was n't completely random and we were n't totally following protocol to the letter! " <p> As ridiculous and paranoiac as it is, that 's the only explanation I 've been able to think of that makes any sense. <h> What To Do? <h> basspig <p> This whole situation is criminally tragic. It would not have happened if the US were the US of 1941. We would have nuked Tehran, Saudi Arabia, Afganistan and maybe Iraq. Instead, America did n't rebuild the WTC, wallows in self-pity and " Chamberlain-esque " appeasement of her enemies. America, her last vestiges, are gone, as you have discovered. She was once the oak tree, but in the winds of Sept 11, she snapped, only to reveal that the inside was a blackened, rotted hollow. <h> M <p> Might want to remember that when Japan attacked the US. They attacked military targets. <p> When the US bombed Japan -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons against noncombatants. <p> The US of today might not have gone that far, but it went places that are not a point of pride, have not made anyone safer, and in fact, have done the opposite. <p> Many of the United States allies are now gunshy of cooperating with American security and law enforcement agencies because of the practice of Rendition. They have to weigh the chance of their citizens being arrested and deported to countries where they will be brutalized against the possibility that citizen might be a terrorist bearing ill will against the US. <p> It 's only a matter of time before one of those agencies withholds information that actually does turn out to be legitimate and something happens. <p> When it does, the US has only itself to blame for the way it 's treated innocent people. <p> As bad as that is, and it 's bad enough, if they 'd ' taken the 1941? option as you so quaintly put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All of those countries would be justified in taking military action against the US as would their allies. <h> Ian <p> Well, NOBODY in WWII comes off well by modern standards. Civilian targets were the primary targets of EVERYBODY. Japan slaughtered civilians by the thousands in China and Korea, Germany rained death from the skies over London for 76 nights straight, killing thousands, the United States killed more-or-less the entire population of Dresden, and did n't leave two bricks on top of each other, and killed even MORE people in Tokyo. It was a brutal, brutal war. <h> Ian <p> The US of 1941 which considered Germany a " European problem " and fought against the " Lend-Lease " program as getting overly involved in an issue that did n't involve us? The Republicans who fought against FDR every step of the way? A United States so passive and uninterested in the outside world that the Japanese government had reason to believe that they could freakin ' attack Hawaii, and, because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? <p> In many ways, we 're better today than we were then. There was moral reason for the United States to intervene as early as 1936, certainly by 1939. And it was absolutely immoral not to do anything against the Blitz. Yet we stood idly by until we were personally attacked. <p> And yet, this year, we offered air support to Libya, to help overthrow a dictator, even though he was one who had been supportive of the United States at times. <p> We should neither over-romanticize the past, nor be too dismissive of today. To state that we are over, and doomed, is to give into despair. <h> Laura Cook <p> Shoshana, so sorry to hear that this happened to you. It 's unbelievable and upsetting that ignorance is still so prevalent in our country. As noted in previous comments, it seems that the terrorists have won, in a way. I hope that you can understand, however, that the police were( seemingly) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been more considerate). I can not empathize, but sincerely hope that nothing like this ever happens to you again, though unfortunately, that possibility is not unlikely. <h> Alex <h> Jamie N <p> My little Shoshi!!! Even after all these years of sporadic communication my motherly protective instinct to save my 14 year old( this is how I still see you) friend took over while reading your ordeal. I wish I could of been there for you. I wish I could of done something right after for you. I am so glad the boys were not w/ you and I am very proud of your conduct and your willingness to write about it. You and hubby will be in mine and Toms prayers for closure in this matter. I love you and miss you!!! <h> Meme <p> Have you heard anything from Frontier after this? At the very least, an apology and refund would be in order. Giving their employees a refresher course in what constitutes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> marlys <p> One little thing : Unless I missed something, I 'd change " watch stealer " to " accused watch stealer " throughout. I guess watch stealers are a bit more common that, oh, terrorists but not only was he not convicted of watch stealing, who knows if there was any reason for the accusations. In most articles, the casual " watch stealer " would n't matter, in this context, of course, it does. <p> According to the AP report : " Frontier Flight 623, with 116 passengers on board, landed without incident in Detroit at 3:30 p.m. EDT after the crew reported that two* people were spending " an extraordinarily long time " in a* bathroom, Frontier spokesman Peter Kowalchuck said. " * Note : TWO people in A bathroom. In addition, the blogger says that she did n't go to the bathroom during the flight, let alone spend " an extraordinarily long time " in one. I 'd say she has a reasonable civil tort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. Or, someone overreacted and included her in out of stupidity. Do n't they need a legitimate complaint to seize and question her? Lots of troubling questions here about who gave whom the authority. <p> The other is, I believe, poetic license, which should not have entered the picture : Blogger says she was given her cellphone while still in her cell, but she did n't know what time it was when she walked out of the building, presumably with cellphone in her possession. <p> My subconscious proofreading eye also found " Perhaps it was two Indian man going to the bathroom in succession? " Man should be " men " -- sorry ; OCD. <p> Otherwise, this was very well-written, and definitely well enough for me to subscribe. <h> Joey <p> Ten years later, and what have we learned? To cower as as security color warnings change? To glance suspiciously at our fellow Americans seated next to us? We were once proud to call our country a melting pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own breed of terrorists. <h> Vivian Chan <p> Well, if it was me and the same thing happened and later I found out that even just 1 of those 50 other phone calls or " shadows " proved to save the life of some others, I 'd thank those people that did their job! <h> pete.d <p> Well, bullshit. There is not enough wealth and resources on the planet to ensure the safety of every single human life. That means we have to balance cost and benefit, along with realistic evaluations of risk. <p> This incident came down 100% on the wrong side of that equation. <p> In any case, it turns out that NOT ONE of those " 50 other phone calls or ' shadows ' " proved to save the life of anyone. So not only do these reactions come down on the wrong side of the analysis, they are examples of an infinitely wrong analysis based on the ratio of cost( non-zero) to benefit( zero). <h> t <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and bringing even more light to the real human impact of our country 's paranoia and inhumane treatment Americans like yourself face in the name of " security ". My heart goes out to you. <h> Sharroot <p> Wow! So exactly what was the suspicious behavior again? Just because some passenger with an overactive imagination says " ooo ooo I 'm scared " should n't mean that the authorities have to react to it! If one of my kids thought there 's was a monster in the closet, I would n't t show up with a flack jacket and a bazooka to check it out. This is so sad. And definitely racist. We 've got to get rid of the ridiculous patriot act. P.S. I 'm an old white lady. <h> Kiyoshigirl <p> This is bullshit, pure and simple. You were targeted because of the color of your skin, as were your seat mates. My daughter, a fair skinned, girl of Irish and Polish descent has a boyfriend who is of Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different situations it is ridiculous. I truly hate to say this, but I sometimes worry that her life will be difficult if they get married and have a family. Will her husband constantly be the target of ignorant idiots? Will she and their potential children needlessly suffer because her husband and their father is targeted? I hate this. All of it. <h> Ocean <p> Shitty policy. There has to be a way to protect the liberties of people that does n't involve violating the liberties of those same people. It 's a brute force solution to a problem that requires not brute force but intelligence to solve. <h> Detroit resident <p> I hope you 've found some comfort now -- with your family and friends, in the arms of your husband. Historically, Detroit has been a flashpoint for violence along socioeconomic and racial lines. This situation fits right into that context -- as an arbitrary, mean, and disproportionate treatment reserved for the " hated hues. " It 's also outstanding that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit, as your inspiration. Your story renews and breathes new life into his struggle and his principles. And lastly, my understanding of patience in the face of hardship has deepened because of your narrative. You 're a gifted communicator, and I hope that helps you heal not just your wounds, but the open wounds of our entire nation. Shalom, salam, peace. <h> John <p> obviously you have never actually been in real trouble with the cops. Outrage? Indignities? Jiminy Christmas, so what, you were taken off a plane and checked out, good for the authorities that they take reports seriously. Consider yourself lucky you were held in a holding cell in America, in most other countries you wouldnt have had a toilet. After a few hours you were released. You act like this is the worst thing that ever happened to anyone. What the hell has the country come to that people are such crybabies. You werent mistreated, you were questioned respectfully, and once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and here you are acting like you are a victim of some sort. Personally I think you are blowing things way out of proportion and Im amazed at how many idiots are sympathizing with you. Wait til one of your family is ripped to shreds by a terrorist bomb and then cry why do n't ya. You want to be mad at someone be mad at the idiots who reported you, not the police who are doing a dangerous job to keep our skies safe. <h> Ninabi <p> Lucky? Really? And if her situation- taken off a plane in handcuffs and strip searched is not considered " real trouble with the cops " - what is " real trouble "? I shudder to consider what else could be in store for American citizens who are cleared by the TSA to fly in an airplane, quietly. <p> Freedom in America should not be reduced to comparing the qualities our jails to those of other countries and coming to the conclusion that a flush toilet in lieu of a fetid bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry this happened to the writer of this blog. I would be feeling lasting anger and a sense of powerlessness after such an ordeal. <h> Allison <p> Just because she was in America and not in a country where being detained means being raped and tortured does not make the events in this situation right. She has every right to complain about an illegal detention based on the lying report of a bigoted person. <p> We have laws in this country, laws that are supposed to be some of the most cherished ideals OF this country. One of them is the freedom from illegal searches and seizures. Another is the right to face one 's accuser. Both of those laws were violated in this instance. <h> pete.d <p> " You werent mistreated, you were questioned respectfully, and once it was determined you had done nothing wrong you were released " <p> All patently false. She was mistreated the moment that she was forcibly removed from the airplane in handcuffs, never mind strip-searched, etc. By definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been, it would have occurred on the airplane, after the original witness had first been questioned, and before( and without) any of the subsequent harassment. <p> And perhaps she was released the moment it was determined she had done nothing wrong, but that determination should have come so much earlier in the process, the officers plainly fail the common-sense test that allows that eventual determination to be used as a defense. <h> Jack <p> You should post the names of the officers who harassed you, along with the names of any of the flight crew that you can get a hold of. Ultimately its the flight crew that made the decision to have you hauled off of the plane like that. Publicly shaming these people for their bigotry is the only way to change anything. <p> I recommend this site http : **35;6142;TOOLONG " The 1700% Project is conceived as a collaborative project utilizing art as intervention. Specifically, the 1700% Project strategically intervenes against the racial profiling and rise of violence and hate directed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monolithic stereotypes of a " Muslim " identity while acknowledging the significance of historical persecution. " <h> chris <p> Never been terrified of terrorists here. Never felt the need to have the government protect me. I am disgusted at the police state we 've evolved into. I blame the American people, for allowing this to happen. YOU believe the crap that is spoon fed to you. You drooled over the lies, and disinformation spoon fed you on 9/11. Now we all must live with the consequences! <p> Nice post let the world know. I am from India, and probably you can judge the following by reading the lines below. <p> I was travelling out of Wauwatosa International Airport in 2010, for my flight to India, via St. Pauls. The check in luggage had been cleared, and I was going with my cabin luggage, when suddenly I was stopped. The lady said me that my name has been picked up " randomly ", and I need a stricter security check. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find several clothes of mine. From that moment on,, I had thought to myself, maybe this " random " check was because I am an Indian, and this post from a US citizen, nails my belief. <p> I was denied a housing apartment when the house owner heard I was from India, she just hung up. <p> Though I am not a a Muslim, just wanted to let you know, that Muslims working on Research and Patents at Harvard / MIT need to go an extra mile( maybe wait one to two months more) for renewing this visa. <p> All of the above are my personal experiences, and I have witnessed it. <p> Thank God you got through this event with out further infringement on your civil rights, although it seems people of a certain color have few whether it is 9/11 or not. How do we regain the rights that MLK died while trying to secure? Did we ever have them? <p> So sorry for your ordeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Detroit post 9-11. Having re-patriated from Saudi, I found my favorite Middle Eastern restaurants flying American flags and the owners reporting no abuse or drop in business. The Arab Americans in the metro area being so well established, acceptance seemed universal of these citizens, immigrants who in Detroit help revitalize. I felt prejudice against Muslims was very low compared to Phoenix &; other cities. Middle Eastern restaurants went out of business in Scottsdale solely because of 9-11. A Sikh gas station owner was murdered in Phoenix by ignorant racists. <p> But let 's not forget " driving while Black " and the ordeals that take place there. Being pulled over on the e-way by a dozen police cars at gun point because you resemble a bank robber who is 30 yrs younger, and detained there on your knees in the heat, handcuffed, hoping your neighbors do n't drive by. Or my Mexican girlfriend going to Kinkos, having raw eggs thrown at her and the most vile things screamed at her. Many in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance. Many are proud they only speak " American " and know no other languages. We have a culture that glorifies ignorance, and it is these people who cause trouble. Just like that monster in Norway who may have had a PHD, but was so filled with hate it cancelled out any brains he ever had. <p> Everybody join your local Kristof Reader Meetup and we try to create a world without hate. <p> I 'm sorry. I 'm so angered and saddened by what happened that that is all I can muster. I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry this happened to you. I 'm sorry that people continue to spread hate and bigotry on this post. I 'm sorry that this is what it means to be American : to spread hate, paranoia and fear. I 'm sorry. I 'm going to go and hug my children and do the best I can to teach them not to hate and fear others based on ethnicity so that this can not happen to others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry this happened to you. I am not a fan of suing people, but I think you have a real case here. This goes beyond questioning- no one should be forced to remove their clothing in the presence of strangers or locked up without evidence. If you need financial support I 'd be glad to donate what I can, along with many others. <h> Vivian Chan <p> " I am not a fan of suing people, but I think you have a real case here. " -- -- Sure the security personnel for doing their duty to respond to a call. What if you had family members on one of the other planes with a similar call and nobody responded, and it DID have plotting people on it( maybe they were carry articles of a weapon to use later) <p> " no one should be forced to remove their clothing in the presence of strangers or locked up without evidence. " -- - What evidence would you want a terrorist to have. If there was evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land or injected into a building. Are you looking for a t-shirt that says " I have something hidden here " or maybe you are just clueless? <p> " If you need financial support I 'd be glad to donate what I can, along with many others. " -- - Ahh, the answer to my previous question about having a clue has been answered in full. Nice job. <p> I am so sorry. I wish folks would stop with the profiling already. And another thing, what is this with saying folks who have to go to the bathroom during a flight are possibly dangerous people? Leaves me to wonder, if going to the bathroom is also suspicious behavior, then I too should never fly again. I have a bladder disease that causes me to make frequent trips to the bathroom. I just do n't get it. How can use of bathroom equate to dangerous? It is bad enough folks have to be molested to get on board, now if they are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous or suspicious? People need to get a grip. The problem is not skin color or place of birth or religion, or how many times someone visits the toilet. The problem is that we are a scared people that are willing to give up all of our liberties to feel safe to those that may not have our best interests in mind. <h> Po <p> Thank you for this. I sincerely appreciate your relating your experience so that others can learn. It is unforgivable and you have my support. This is not the America it should be and frankly, I 'm ashamed. <p> I am horrified and angry. I ca n't believe that things like this happen in the USA. This is not the country I grew up in. <p> I have n't flown for years, and I have no intention of ever flying in the future. I do n't want to be patted down, touched, by some stranger, or have my body exposed to a " scan " that sometimes make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers going through my luggage, although that 's less offensive but I am concerned about theft. I 'll take a train or a bus before I get on a plane again. <p> The previous commenter is correct : The terrorists have won. <p> Benjamin Franklin said that " Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. " We 're over that precipice, and it makes me ill to think of it, to live it. <p> Great account of what happened! Makes you wonder about who is instilling terror &; fear in the people. America is not a place I will visit anytime soon, it scares me. Sorry you had to endure such nonsense, Trouble is you ca n't fix this shit it 's just getting worse. Feel the Love! <p> The fact that this horrible thing happened to you does not suprise me at all. I live in Australia and this week on television during the media build up to Sept 11, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. One in particular sickened me quite a bit, a rather old senile looking ' authoritive ' figure said something along the lines of ' this september 11, if you even look like a terrorist -- you will be investigated ' or some such similar nonsense. Immediately in my mind I thought, that any person not fitting the ' white ' mould, was going to have a really crappy day. After reading this posting, boy was my initial feeling right -- although I am truly sorry that it was. I was really sickened by what the ' authoritive ' figures did to you and I sincerely hope you never experience anything so degrading to your person, ever again. It is stuff like this that really leaves me questioning the small minded morons of the world. <p> A grotesque injustice. It is imperative that a president is elected who opposed the Patriot Act and all of the violations that have followed from the aftermath of 9/11, not to mention the appallingly brutal and counterproductive wars. I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill. <h> richs-lxhrich <p> Somebody just posted a link here from Google + I am shocked and saddened at what has happened to our society. In Europe and the US we claim to have democracy and to be free and civilized, while attacking other countries for civil-rights abuses and and a lack of democracy. What hypocrisy. We are all being controlled, we have no rights. What happened to this poor woman is disgusting, sickening even, in the so called land of the free. I really hope that this story goes viral. People need to see this. <h> David <p> Very sorry to hear that you had to go through this, what an unpleasant and frightening experience. <p> Nonetheless, the only person that has done wrong is the passenger who, perhaps due to their own personal prejudices, alerted authorities that you were acting suspiciously. <p> The security response -- though heavyhanded -- is one that I would expect, especially on the anniversary of Sept 11 and I and millions of others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion, especially aboard a plane, must be investigated. That is simply the way of the world now and if people want to keep using aircraft they will have to put up with it. <p> Can you imagine if three people who really WERE going to blow up the plane were reported as suspicious by a passenger and the authorities decided not to take it seriously. And then the plane WAS blown up. The FBI and Homeland security etc would be hauled over the coals without mercy for their inaction. Their ' ineptitude ' would be splashed across the world 's papers. They are in a no-win situation where they are damned if they do, and damned if they do n't. <p> What you went through was not your fault. Neither was it the fault of the authorities. In the end it 's the fault of terrorists, extremists and fanatics who, through their terrible actions, have created the world we now live in. <h> J <p> One small flaw in your logic. If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plane -- why would they wait until the police boarded to blow it? <p> You could make the argument that MAYBE they were actually going to blow a connecting flight( ignoring the part where they 'd have to pass through security again and, thus, increase the chances the device might be discovered) but it does n't seem all that likely. <h> pete.d <p> " Nonetheless, the only person that has done wrong is the passenger who, perhaps due to their own personal prejudices, alerted authorities that you were acting suspiciously. " <p> That really depends on what that passenger actually reported. <p> If the passenger reported genuinely suspicious activities, then yes... they are the only one who has done wrong. And they should be prosecuted for submitting a false report to the police. <p> If on the other hand, as I suspect, they simply identified the three as being " suspicious " and law enforcement took it from there, then it 's very far from the truth that only the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved are completely culpable, for failing to protect the civil rights of the three and for overreacting to the report. <h> John B. Mordecai <h> What To Do? <p> I think she 's looking for a book deal and will get it with so many sympathizers. And, everyone keeps telling her to sue. Well, guess whose pockets that is going to come out of. I was quite saddened to see that our local newspaper had a spread about the local Muslim 's after 9/11( on the front page) and on the 3rd page was an article about one of the helicopter pilots that was killed in Afghanistan. So sorry, but we are trying to show the world that we love everyone, that we are forgetting about the men and women who have put their lives on the lines for us so that all of us can add our little opinions and comments to this post. <h> Allison <p> Do not sully the memory of the people who have died fighting for our freedoms by invoking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You do their sacrifice a disservice when you do so. Our right to disagree with our government is fundamental to this country, and we do n't have to give it up because people died " for us. " <h> M <h> CNelson( NZ) <p> Amazing post, thank you for writing about this in such detail ; everyone should know what is going on. I am so sorry this happened to you. It breaks my heart that fear still rules. Strangely, the fear of someone on that plane( their fear of terrorism -- which in their mind must look like foreigners on a plane) took precedent over the fear of you and the two men who were taken away and mistreated. Why were you allowed to be genuinely frightened, because of someone else 's fearful suspicions? This itself is proof that the world we live in is NOT ok. We have not advanced to a better place in ten years. We are all living in fear -- whether a fear of terrorism, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused for looking a certain way or being from a particular part of the world. We should not be segregated by this, and yet we are. Only more information and a better understanding will help -- I believe your post is a part of that. <p> Reading this from the comfort and sanity of Australia, I am horrified at what you endured. The events of what happened ten years ago were truly horrible but the stories that we keep reading of the level of paranoia in the US are likewise
