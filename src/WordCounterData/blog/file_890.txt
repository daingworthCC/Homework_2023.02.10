Do n't forget, we still have to pickup the tab for the 1,500 or so entities who have been granted waivers by the administration. You guys can try and argue this any way you can but all you do is to sit and throw rocks at Papa Johns and probably, the other companies due to a burden forced on them. Fools brought this legislation to the fore and fools will continue to endorse it. Remember this when you complain about prices next year. <p> I am stunned by the endless supply of geniuses that think the consumer is not already paying for healthcare for the uninsured. Must be the " Keep yo gubmint hands off'n my medicare " crowd and the same bunch that thinks romney 's tax plan adds up. I suppose there really is a bagger born every minute. <p> Romneys tax plan was a good idea. The problem with libs is that they will throw out the babby with the bathwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it their way or not at all. You guys sent Obama back to the White House. Papa Johns is just one example of consequences of actions. There really is a liberal fool born every minute. <p> This is one of the simplest managerial economics concepts known to man. Companies will hire more workers as they are needed to deliver goods/services demanded profitably. If he fires workers, then he loses sales( and probably net income). If he raises the price of pizzas he loses sales( and probably net income). <p> FC per pizza increases as # of pizza 's sold decreases. <p> What about Romney 's tax plan was a good idea? What about Romney 's tax plan did you even know anything about? If it was such a good idea, why was it kept so secret? <p> Just as I said a day ago. Boycott Papa John 's and all others who feel the same way. His pizza sucks anyway that 's why he has to give it away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery fee. Peyton is an owner now as well. <p> the carlysle or stanford, or which ever building it is that he has a unit, as they are all the same anyway, is on the beach. <p> which in florida all beaches are public, but his community has a neat trick of simply owning all the surrounding area so their is no parking near it, thus making it a private beach for the unit owners as no one wants to treck the miles in sand it would take to enjoy that section of beach as he and his fellow billionares do. <p> a beach which has a clubhouse that will offer you attendants who bring you the beer or tea your request, as you lounge on beach chairs under the umbrellas they have staked in the sand for you. <p> their is a security guard in the lobby of his building 24 hrs a day, which is redundant as their is a security gate to the community in general. <p> service elevators for contractors, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallways, you lose the contracts with that building. <p> every year we all have a battle with them, as they are asked to not have their lights on at night during turtle season, so that the lights do nt turn the turtles away from their natural breeding places, which these people fight against every year, as if closing their window, or pushing the button that electrically engages their hurricane shutters is just too much to ask of them. <p> aparently it is just a massive inconvinience for them to exist without thier million dollar ocean views at night, even for just a little while. <p> heated pools with hot tubs, exercise rooms, entertainment rooms, and all the stuff you think is only in movies is what this guy lives like, as a second home.not even the primary place he lives, but a real estate investment. <p> i never begrudged any of these people for this stuff.well except for the sea turtles thing. <p> but to cry financial hardship is something entirely different, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit would cover any of the taxes he claims are crushing him. <p> for what ever it is worth judge judy lives in that community too.and once upon a time seargent slaughter. <p> i never thought it would matter, but i guess it kind of does now. i used to do work at the condo complex in which the papa johns douche has a unit. <p> the area is called pelican bay which is a very wealthy area, and his building is in a subsection even more exclusive called bay colony. <p> in which 4th floor units are priced at around 2 million dollars, and so on up to penthouses that reach ten million. <p> i do nt honestly recall what floor his unit was on, but it really does nt matter, as that one property he owns w/o taking into account the luxurious extras, costs more than any tax hike he may experience. <p> so if you ever ponder the legitimacy of his complaints about losing money, and the explanation as to why he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish greedy bastard above all else is accurate. <p> that unit isn even his primary residence, but an extra one. his crying poor is exactly what you think it is. <p> not because im a lefty, or a socialist, or what ever. <p> but because i have seen first hand the obscene wealth he has, that makes all his claims simply untrue in reality. <p> dominos takes their money and gives it to the gay hating prolife bunch, so they are nt an option. <p> which leaves me with pizza hut, lil ceasers, and hungry howies. <p> which lil ceasers does nt deliver anymore, hungry howies are few and far between, and pizza hut is a tad pricey, which even if you figure out how to negate that, you feel bad for doing so as all their delivery people are senior citizens.so you feel like a dick for not getting the 4 dollar 2 liter and keeping your order at under 20 bucks. <p> Although I do n't know if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizzas. They come 2 to a package. You just unwrap them and throw em in the microwave for a couple of minutes. I know, frozen microwave pizza sounds horrible but it 's quite good. They even come with little plate things for them to sit on in the microwave. No dishes. I 'm a bachelor. <p> lol, im married with bacholer sensabilities, but california pizza kitchen has kind of ruined me when it comes to diy pizza at home.pretty much anything " french bread " can fill that void in the end, but damn california pizza kitchen makes it all seem subpar, those bastards. <p> neat lil piece of info, when you get married you may know the wife will take up 99 percent of the closet space, but lesser known is they do the same with the freezer.which is always smaller that it should be. <p> making frozen pizza a luxury, even the red baron ones which are half the size.just a heads up so you can prepare for it if ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil.the way a tobacco ceo is guilty of murder as is a serial killer cannibal. <p> same end result, making their addition to the world murder, but it isnt the same thing.if you think it isnt different, and any ceo of a tobacco company is a jeffery dahmer, or any serial killer is the same as a tobacco ceo, please do your moral part, and start slaughtering tobacco ceo 's, as you would a serial killer.do us all the favor. <p> or just come back to reality where a corperation is a corperation, and as such is successfull through being more cost effective across the board more so than other guys.that the guys who are antiunion hurt employees( walmart) more than others. <p> and btw, just so you know, a new town has been built, even in the face of the economic downturn we are all experiencing, called " ave maria ". thats right, a town called this, not just a church.it is able to continue construction while others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dominos money.a private town in which people get help to buy homes, and are courted, if they are christian just the right way.a place that is actually land in one county, but dominos has bought so much of it they are trying to validate being their own county, so they can make their own laws based on their religious views, not just rules for a home owners association based on jesus. <p> if you think every pizzeria does this, you have a very vivid imagination, or schitzophrenia. <p> the point being, if a national company is willing to seek domination of a social paradigm, and doing so in the name of the religious right, you can be sure your pizza purchase goes to endevours that are homophobic, prolife, and generally stupid across the board, more so than other guys, who are simply businesses. not all the same <p> It might help if you were paying attention to the issue in this post. Those companies CEO 's have n't publicly declared their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ARE different. See, logic is n't that difficult when you 're not trying to change the subject. <p> Yes, many of the others also have policies that I feel are Bad. That is why I buy from Locally owned small businesses when I can instead of Any of the " Chain " stores. But, most of those other stores ' CEO 's do n't publicly show their GREED and their total disrespect for the workers. I like having a list of companies who have policies that I disagree with so that I will be able to better decide where to shop. <p> i never was one to hold grudges against my parents, blaming them for not preparing me for the world or anything, but on this im kind of pissed at my dad for never bothering to mention that is so called " equality " that woman want is more based in superiority that actual equality. <p> so i learned the hard way, that closet space and freezer space are things they get to have and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also do nt get to decorate.they may even give you a room all your own, a man cave if you will, and even still will bust your balls about how that plays out, as if dictating the decor of every inch of the rest of the home isnt enough. <p> it is a very odd imbalance, they know it, and seek to rationalize it, which is what makes them look crazy in the end. <p> if i had known i may have still gotten married but i do nt know that i would have bothered to buy property, as it is no fun paying month after month down some debt for a thing you never get to actually enjoy owning. <p> still living in that idealistic world in which a marraige is this partnership of equality and the participants avail themselves of reason. <p> youll see. <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch? v=3mnuelIh... it isnt a partnership with negotiations, it is a lifelong( or decades long as it is now) battle to reconsile what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a civil war, with the rationality required for negotiations not being garunteed or present with any regularity. <p> it is a luxury that either party can be afforded sometimes, if lucky.but is not common <p> That was wild and it explains a lot. Good thing we 're buried down here in two-day old comments where no one will notice, otherwise you would be set upon by those who may be less............ " rational "! Hang in there bud! <p> most of my diet is of food that i tried without thinking about it first, other wise i wouldnt have fucked with it.like sushi for instance. <p> im just saying you cant talk about shit food, when you are offering recipes for that which exists in our society more often than anything else, as roadkill.kind of takes away the culinary street cred ya know. <p> i find that for most of these guys it is about staying busy and investing in the future, with a " what if everything falls to shit, and my money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuz of the banks bullshit " <p> which is why so many prowrestlers have gyms, even tho they tend to be guys like mick foley, who famously avoids such a place. <p> that, and for some, spanning all business 's their is just never enough money.it isnt about having currency, it is a game for them.one in which they are compelled to win for the sake of winning, and the value of the money isnt nearly as important as getting more of it than others. <p> i mean i do nt know payton manning from shit, and he could just be whoring himself out lately to pizza magnates, and gps systems out of financial hardship.or he could be capitalizing on that he kind of looks like and sounds like dermot mulroney in the never ending sport of making more money than the other guy. <p> It has nothing to do with him being successful and everything to do with being a douche nozzle. The man makes a big political flap about Obamacare and that is what people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're bitching about it costing you cash to ensure your employees have the basic healthcare to make their lives a bit better - then you deserve the backlash that you 're getting. <p> he could at least own it and still wouldnt be a big deal, like a donald trump who we all know is a greedy fuck who would sell your children to feed an animal if their was a dollar to be made in doing so. <p> we give his ass a television show and no bad press.cuz he owns it. <p> it is the pretending that they are nt the greediest fucks that is the problem <p> That is what pisses me off the most about this ass. Nobody asked him, nobody forced him, or nobody prompted him to make a political flap about this! It was he that chose to not insure his employees - so yes, own up to that decision and move on. However, it was also he that tried to blame Obama in the media for ' forcing ' him to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for, would have to pass that cost along to consumres! So, instead of providing healthcare to his employees at a cost 6 - 8 million - he elected to not cover his employees, lay them off and/or cut back their hours so he could get around the law, give away 2 million pizzas and advertise the hell out of it to the tune of about 24 - 32 million dollars. That is what makes him a complete douche nozzle! <p> Hey all you guys on the anti-Papa John bandwagon. How many other Pizza Chains, how many other department stores, how many other fast food chains, offer health insurance? Fuckin ' none. <p> Chick-fil-a, Papa Johns, a few others that happened to try to get people to vote against Obama, including nearly all religions, why single out Papa Johns, because he 's successful? That 's exactly it. So many people feel shit on in this country, you do n't have to work a minimum wage pizza job. Get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life instead of sniveling about a guy that has made it big. You wo n't get anywhere crying about how big an asshole he is. Get out there an make something of yourself, or in 10 years, you 'll just be sitting there, bitching about someone else that made it, and you did n't. <p> All this shit about a boycott, he 's laughing all the way to the bank. Do you think he could just shut the whole fucking thing down and retire if he wanted to, and put all the broke dick minimum wage people out of work? He could quit right now, and then you guys would snivel that he was unfair to his workers that just got fired because of some dumbass boycott. Do n't like his pizzas? Do n't buy them, As for me, if I want one, I 'll buy it. I admire people that have made it to the top, I do n't resent them. And if you do n't like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work there. <p> Do you even remotely read anything prior to posting something? I suggest you do next time so you do n't look like a complete ass! My entire point is that nobody made this an issue until Papa John tried to make it a political statement ON HIS OWN!!! HE, PAPA JOHN brought this to the attention of the media by trying to make a ridiculous political statement and to hurt Obama - THAT is why he is getting hammered and it is well deserved. <p> hey we are a capitalist society, and the truth is the wealthy do nt have a clue how good they have it here compared to anyplace else, regardless of taxes, as we respect the persuit of wealth.for fuck sake it is engrained in us as part of the american dream, so we do nt begrudge anyone for wanting to obtain obscene wealth, which cant be said for many other places, where the ptchforks and torches crowd does nt extend that courtasy. <p> instead of forcing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they exploited others.i live in a town that is entire based on finding new ways to offer services to the rich.from actual viable ones like pest control, to house keeping, to companies that literally get contracts to feed fish in koi ponds for the 10 months of the year people are nt here to do it themselves. <p> i mean can you imagine being the guy who thought up how to make that seem like an actual business in and of itself, and sell it to others? what is essentialy the level of responsibility we get out of most children.to feed the fucking fish.thats it. <p> it is why no matter what, the worlds wealthy always come here.cuz our society is condusive to them more than others.even if they have to pay huge hospital bills if they get sick here as opposed to how it is at home for them. <p> it is the assholes who complain about it that are the problem. <p> i mean if we can go through the effort of finding a certification to officialy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck you for crying about financial hardships.they claim to be the job creators, while proving they are not as invested in the hard work for themselves that they expect of others. <p> it isnt about how many offer medical coverage, as we all know that is a scumbag way of keeping costs down, which is why their isnt competition for those jobs as their is for others.it is why being a pizza guy is a refuge job across the board. <p> we accept this reality and negotiate it accordingly. <p> what we do nt except is people who expect others to bust their ass in the " do it yourself " vein when they themselves have every advantage and cant suffer the most minor of inconveniences.which they expect everyone else to suffer with a smile. <p> wan na run a business as a-moraly as possible.go for it, you have every right to unfortunately.no one begrudges you for exploiting opportunities. <p> but we will take issue with you complaining about that which the rest of us suffer as a defacto state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too expensive and that is a problem, ok.good for you. <p> but do nt complain that it is a problem, only when you have to pay for it, as if it isnt a massive problem for your employees when they get sick, and their bills are in a week what they make all year. <p> People get sick of high prices, cash cowing people. We had a Papa John 's in my town, it cost too much so it died. So did StarBucks, Java Daves, Furniture factory outlet, Advanced auto we had 2 now there is 1! etc... It takes about 5 years for a new place to go in my town. <p> I met Java Daves, or a corp person from them in the 1990 's. He knocked at my door &; offered me a free bag of coffee, it I did n't mind answering some questions. What is my income or the income of the people around here or their financial situation? <p> They had a no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least they go &; test the waters if no sales! <p> Boycott this business. The world would be better off without selfish jerks like him. I never realized just how rich the country has made him selling his
