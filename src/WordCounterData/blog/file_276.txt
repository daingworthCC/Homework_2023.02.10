After my mother 's conversion to Catholicism she brought me to this parish and I endured it as a young atheist out of love for my mother and my love of singing. The pop/rock hymns were not objectionable to me since they had such a low theological content -- if any. Plus when I joined the church 's small ensemble choir I loved the irony of being an atheist in the sanctuary. This was rather a hippy parish back then and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the first time I heard the word " Catholicism. " I went to one class on the Catholic faith and this is where I first heard the word. It sounded very ominous to me which is why I still remember it, that and the fact that the priest pretty much explained away the miraculous to me. As an atheist I did n't believe in miracles and yet it did n't quite sit right with me that the priest did n't either. I was not surprised to find out later that both of the parish priests had left the Church to get married. <p> Looking back it annoys me that my first contact with the Church had the catechetical content of a felt banner, though I probably was n't very open to the truth at that point. It just would have been nice to actually hear the truth. <p> Actually yesterday I saw on another Blog WDTPRS by Father Z that there were Protesters from SNAP at one of their meeting places to press them on this very important issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to SNAP. So it is not just priests but NUNS and brothers who committed abuse. <p> I entered the Church through a Paulist-run parish. Having been Episcopalian for 13 yrs before this, I knew the basics of catholicism... and I was a good mainstream left-liberal. But even I was surprised when our Paulist associate pastor told the RCIA group that VC1 was basically a power-grab by the Pope b/c Italian troops were knocking on the Vatican 's door and nothing else happened at that Council. When I noted that papal infallibility was defined by that Council, Father said, " Oh that. Nobody believes that! " <p> Fr.
