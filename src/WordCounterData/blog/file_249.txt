5133141 <h> It 's too much to come up with something clever. <p> I have been terrible about documenting our last couple of weeks. Even with my phone. Maybe it is the pneumonia that WON'T.GO.AWAY or the therapy sessions every waking second of the day or the husband who ditched me for Seattle. Not sure which one wins that competition... but it has all amounted to a hill of beans as far as picture taking goes. <p> So here are a few lousy, random shots that I was able to scrounge up from my phone. <p> A few weeks ago I snuck away for the day with my parentals to the lake under the guise of a " work day ". My dad worked on building a fence and my mom and I worked on locating all of the antique haunts around town We found a few treasures( an arm load of yard sticks, 3 walking canes, and a tiny flower frog for me). We hit an interesting " farm " where a raving mad dog nearly kept us from being able to leave the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it there. I 'm not a huge fan of pretty antique stores. I kind of like the " cluttered, dirty, **40;6188;TOOLONG... kind of stores( mainly... those are the stores where I can afford stuff). But I think this barn/store may have crossed the line for me as it was more of a **37;6230;TOOLONG kind of place. Although. I did find my treasured blue yardstick so it was worth the tetanus shot. <p> Piles and piles of stuff. These were fun little drawers. What do you do with stuff like this? I guess no one else knows either judging from the 14 years of filth? <p> Dirty nasty but could be lovely jadite <p> On another note. My kids do n't snuggle in bed. Are n't they Baby Magic fresh and sweet in this photo? <p> Reality check. for the house crashers among us... there is a little sneak in on our sadly neglected 1980s bedroom <p> On another side note... HAPPIEST OF BIRTHDAYS to my niece who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made you for dinner tonight made all your dreams come true. Thank you for filling in for my hubby. You are a wonder with the kids. I 'm sorry he could n't be here to cook you up a proper meal. I hope
