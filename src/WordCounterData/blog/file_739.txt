5182541 <h> Rick Reilly Is The Most Hated Man On The Internet <p> Before Rick Reilly strong-armed Stuart Scott into crediting his Twitter feed for reporting news everyone already knew, he was already a target of the blogosphere -- mostly due to his recycled columns and absurdly cheesy one-liners. We did n't think the target on his back could get any bigger, or that other well-known journalists would jump aboard the Reilly hate train. Well both of those things happened, and it now appears that Rick Reilly is the most hated person on the internet. <p> Besides the usual rash of fans on Twitter making jokes about crediting Rick Reilly for any piece of news at all, the likes of Ed Werder, Jason Whitlock, Mike Francesca and Jimmy Traina have all gotten their shots in. <p> Ed Werder : <p> And it even appeared on the front page of ESPN.com before Werder deleted the tweet : <p> " Byron Leftwich will start for the Pittsburgh Steelers at quarterback against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night as Ben Roethlisberger will sit the game out due to a sprained shoulder, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed to ESPN that Roethlisberger 's rib and shoulder injuries occurred on the same play. The source said it remains unknown how long the quarterback might be unable to play with the injury to the front of his throwing shoulder. " <p> Glazer, as you might assume, was pissed : <p> Hey @ sportscenter just to clear up confusion, my last name is not spelled S-O-U-R-C-E
