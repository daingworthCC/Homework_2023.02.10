5129541 <h> Autism, Plurality, Politics, Self-Advocacy <h> Richard Whither conservatism? <p> I am a conservative in a very literal sense : there are things about society that should indeed be conserved, and there is much to be said about a measured approach to politics, rather than discarding everything for the sake of novelty. I believe strongly in family values, but do not believe they should be restricted to one type of family. I think that cultural preservation is of the utmost importance. Of course, engaging in racist, xenophobic, misogynistic or homophobic hatred would be rank hypocrisy from me, considering the company I share in our system, and our own experiences. <p> However, I started to distance myself from the label, because of the extremism that masquerades under the moniker of ' conservatism '. Loathing hurled at asylum-seekers. Attempts at aggressive privatization of the British Welfare State, in a neo-Thatcherite mould. Republican tripe about President Obama 's birth certificate.

This is n't to say, of course, that it 's Obama 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred and use it as a strategy to oppose the President 's policies. One can disagree with him without resorting to covert -- or overt, in the case of many talk-radio and Fox News ideologues -- racial attacks. For my part, I supported Obama over either of his Republican rivals, but I had far more respect for John McCain than I did the odious Mitt Romney. <p> I would like to see conservative parties like the Tories and Republicans sincerely evaluate the meaning of ' conservatism ', and put witless extremism to rest. <p> Conservatism is n't puerile ranting about asylum-seekers, birth certificates, Muslims and gays.
