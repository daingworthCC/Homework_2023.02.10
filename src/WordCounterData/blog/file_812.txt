5190041 <p> Even with this scholarship I can barely pony up dough for the plane ticket to and fro, but it is now a reality. Whaddaya know? I was picked by the DFA board, but all of your votes and support of my work here at Daily Kos helped substantially ; if there was going to be any year I had a chance to win this scholarship it was this one. Thank you very much for all your support. This should be quite an interesting and enlightening experience. <p> These past couple of years have been quite a journey as far as my writing. I have drawn as much ire as I have praise, but that 's the name of the game. I have thick skin for the most part, so it does n't bother me too much. It ca n't. The truth is uncomfortable, and it needs to be stated bluntly regardless of the consequences for the greater good as much as it can do good in the blogosphere in my view. <p> I have been always happy to spark a healthy, substantive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our discourse, even if that healthy debate may be coming to an end depending on the changing rules at this site. It 's a shame, because there really is no third way to be a real Democrat. That simple fact should be allowed to be pointed out even during election season. There 's a reason the Democratic Party Platform as written is a New Deal platform instead of a Hamilton Project platform. <p> In fact, one of the few reasons the term liberal does n't have exactly the same classical conservative bent it once had( a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economics), at least in the United States, is because of the proponents of Modern American liberalism like FDR. FDR and the New Deal coalition adopted offshoots of the more sweeping social programs from Huey Long, Dr. Francis Townsend, and the Union Party ; all who criticized FDR relentlessly. In addition to Eugene Debs 's socialist platform years earlier building coalitions over time for these causes, that 's what really brought us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Dissent brought us FDIC insurance( why you did n't lose everything in 2008) when Huey Long filibustered the banking reforms of 1933 adding it in the legislative package thus bringing 50 years of financial stability. I have a feeling all of this as well as the landslide election in 1936 is somehow being forgotten around these parts by those who treat Democrats as a proverbial Tinkerbell needing undying faith. Dissent is good and healthy, always was regardless of what party or group one is in. <p> So the cries for some to leave what is called the Democratic Party these days, and in turn this site, mainly just for pointing out the documented factual attack on New Deal programs for years by Peter Peterson, Alan Simpson, David Walker, the cat food commission( enabled by some Democratic leaders), and how it rightly bothers them, is perplexing. I figure this is mainly just a matter of some people needing to be more informed about the actual history of Peter Peterson 's attacks on social security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name a few. The make up and funding of the cat food commission is really anything but a CT if one knows any history about the purpose of the Peterson Institute at all. <p> Social Security does n't belong in the dishonest economically ignorant debate about deficits that purveys Washington. The well being of seniors should not be put in jeopardy, just because politicians do n't want to learn how the budget they are in charge of operates in tandem with our Monetary system. Why should seniors have to suffer for their ignorance? I do n't think they should, and I write about it all the time, because it angers me. <p> Social Security is our most successful program to date, and it defines the real Democratic party platform within the last 50 years. Neoliberal third way Democrats within the Hamilton Project decided to stray from that platform while adopting many of the Chicago School 's policies putting Social Security in danger of privatization and into the idiotic deficit debate( empirically deficit spending only matters if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it does n't belong and is irrelevant, anyway. We should stay true to the New Deal Democratic party platform or find a new name. <p> The sham that was called a " foreclosure fraud settlement " and the poorly staffed( 100 or so compared to over 1000 staffed during the S &L; crisis) Mortgage Task Force is still a joke. It 's a joke that is similar to AG Eric Holder Justice Department 's record of prosecutions or even criminal referrals on financial crimes. I have written about this from time to time, and it is still relevant. <p> It 's relevancy bothers some people who want it to go away during an election year, but it 's not going away. Ignoring it did n't go away during the Great Depression, and no wishful partisan discipline will make it go away now. The only debt problem we have is a private household debt problem, and it 's called debt deflation 101. <p> Peoples ' lives and national income depend on focusing on this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great posters and commentators here on Daily Kos know this, and to them it is every bit as important. Since my time here starting in 2007, I have noticed that Daily kos is quite a big melting pot. And within that pot is a site full of well informed posters that remember what the Democratic party platform is supposed to stand for even during election season ; a season that never really ends. <p> There are many people I consider friends on this site. I ca n't name them all( I do n't want anyone to be mad at any omissions), but all of your support in my diaries is noticed, believe me. It would depress the hell out of me if a majority of posters on this site thought supporting Democratic politicians regardless of the outcome is more important then ending a Too Big to Fail Financial system ; a system that will crash again soon enough. And once it does it will leave countless people destroyed ; many of them that have n't even recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of me to find out that a majority of posters believe the lies coming from both parties about the importance of austerity( sending the eurozone back into recession), bond vigilantes, confidence fairies, or even a so called kindler gentler Democratic austerity that keeps real unemployment high as the new normal for the non existent future deficit crisis. Luckily this is not the case. There is real unrest about this. <p> Throughout the course of writing here, I found out that I am not the only one who thinks and feels the way I do. That is comforting to say the least. I write because deficit scare mongering is not morally right or based on any sound foundation. It should be classified as heresy and a tool used to control people and to keep their standard of living down. As Harry Truman said, how many times must you be hit in the head before you realize who is hitting you? <p> That billy club is the lie about deficits and national accounting being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be part of the debate or enabled by Democrats in any way) to keep demand side solutions that make it over the hump out of the equation. It does n't have to be this way. Sadly, a good portion of people think we are resigned to it, but for every one of those there is a Letsgetitdone, bobswern, Dallasdoc, tag from " education ". A tag like " reform " alone is probably not meaningful. <p> To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. - Theodore Roosevelt 1918 <p> I sometimes agree with what you write and sometimes not, but I think you are an asset to Dkos. <p> For example, I do n't think a majority of folks agree support austerity here, but I'vee never taken a poll <p> a majority of posters believe the lies coming from both parties about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession), bond vigilantes, confidence fairies, or even a so called kindler gentler Democratic austerity that keeps real unemployment high as the new normal for the non existent future deficit crisis. <p> We also may mean different things when we use the word, austerity. <p> I 'm from the Elizabeth Warren and Darcy Burner Wing of the Democratic Party! <p> a majority of poster believed that. I did n't say a majority believed that but under these this context austerity refers to a policy of deficit-cutting by lowering spending often via a reduction in the amount of benefits and public services provided like the eurozone and in the U.K. <p>? " Bipartisan usually means that a larger-than-usual deception is being carried out. " - George Carlin - Thank you! I 'm now going to Netroots Nation! <p> To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always voice my opinion when I disagree with policies that go against core Democratic Party principles, whether they are welcomed or not. You do too, one of the reasons you are a favorite diarist of mine. Congratulations again on your NN scholarship, try and have some fun! <p> with Sam Elliott and Peter Weller, when they were after a bad guy, hopping in the car to get ' em, Sam Elliott( the cop) holding a gun in one hand and keys in the other hand says to Peter Weller( the lawyer) : <p> how to link and other cool, mysterious computer wizardry, like embedding videos, I 'm too hung up over the fact that I 'm not as good a writer as lots of folks here. <p> Anyway, your writing feels more like talking, it 's nice. <p> Have fun, I 'll miss not seeing a diary from you for a bit. <p> And you need to write an explicitly mmt diary one of these days. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very simple, direct way. Such as this sentence : " empirically, deficit spending only matters when there 's full employment in a post Bretton Woods world ". <p> To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. - Theodore Roosevelt 1918 <p> To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. - Theodore Roosevelt 1918 <p> I know how hard you worked for this, and you deserve it. Here 's hoping people who do n't appciate dissent do n't harsh your buzz at all. MomCat will show you the ropes and keep you away from assholes, if it 's assholes you want to avoid. Remember to ask if the clown is filleted if she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on them. " --Frederick Douglass <p> great to hear that you 're going to disneyland netroots nation, you really deserve it for all of your contributions to daily kos and for your artwork. i hope that you find cool stuff at nn and have a great time. B) <p> If there was a viable alternative to this so called Democratic Party, I 'd be long gone. The only reason I vote for Democrats is because they are the lesser of two evils. I am who they count on because there is no place else to go. <p> Down through the centuries, this trick has been tried by various establishments throughout the world. They force people to get involved in the kind of examination that has only one aim and that is to stamp out dissent. Pete Seeger <p> You 're one of the most eloquent dissenters among us, and your voice needs to be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Course, from the one affair I attended I was very pleased that the social cameraderie was far more evident and enthusiastically pursued than any piefights. Hell, even the Obamacrats and the FDL'ers lay down together in peace. <p> Be sure to score some Portuguese food while you 're in Providence. It 's one of the best things about coastal New
