5148341 <p> Today 's Globe has a front-page story on how Elizabeth Warren got to where she is today. It 's a very interesting read, both in a big-picture sense( it 's an interesting story), and in that it does a nice job of addressing some specific right-wing talking points about Warren. <p> I 'm not going to summarize the piece -- you should go read the whole thing. But I want to point out a couple of things that struck me. <p> She 's tough, ambitious, and has probably pissed some people off along the way. The story is pretty clear on this point. <p> A wide range of professors and administrators interviewed by the Globe said Warren rose through the mostly male, intensely political world of academia on the strength of her unbridled -- to some, off-putting -- ambition as well as groundbreaking research that brought her national attention and grant money.... Behind the scenes, some of her peers bristled at her ascent, viewing her as smart and capable but also as a climber with sharp elbows.... As Warren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Oklahoma teenager Jim Warren had married had turned into a hard-charging professor whose priorities, she said, did not include having a home-cooked dinner on the table each night.... Warren was growing restless at a university the University of Houston without much national clout.... " She was, in many ways, almost the most ambitious single person on that faculty at that point, " UPenn law professor Colin Diver said. " And that 's saying something. " <p> Here 's the point, made by University of Chicago law professor Douglas Baird -- an eminent bankruptcy law scholar whose approach to bankruptcy could hardly be further from Warren 's( he 's a hardcore law and economics guy, she 's an empiricist who rejects law and economics as " seductively oversimplified, an abstract theory with no grounding in reality ") : <p> Baird, the Chicago law professor who was once Warren 's sparring partner, said : " To the extent that people criticize Elizabeth for having sharp elbows, that was at a time where, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows, you were going to be run over. " <p> I have some personal experience with this sort of thing. I was a law clerk for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose " first woman to ever... " list is so long that I ca n't even remember everything that 's on it. She 's an extraordinary person for whom I am deeply honored to have worked. But let 's be clear about this : she 's probably the toughest person I 've ever met, and she was never short on ambition. It 's no accident that people who shatter barriers tend to be the types who are n't afraid to break a few eggs on the way to making an omelet. <p> So to those who think Elizabeth Warren is too ambitious, or too strident, or too whatever, I say this : that 's exactly what I want in a Senator. I want someone who is not afraid of standing up existing power structures because she thinks they are biased toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will make waves when waves need to be made. I want someone who does n't see bipartisanship as an end in itself if the folks on the other side are simply wrong( I 've written several times that I think bipartisanship for its own sake is just a fetish, though a widely-practiced one among the punditocracy). I want a fighter. There 's really no doubt who that is in this Senate race. <p> The end of Cherokee-gate. The Globe story effectively demolishes the myth that Warren tried to get ahead in the academic world by claiming Native American heritage. According to the story, " in two dozen interviews with the Globe, a wide range of professors and administrators who recruited or worked with Warren said her ethnic background played no role in her hiring. " And several academics went on the record to say that they had no idea of Warren 's heritage. One found the notion laughable : <p> Robert H. Mundheim, the dean who hired Warren at Penn, laughed when asked whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody who 's got a small percentage of Native American blood -- is that a minority? " he said. " I do n't think I ever knew that she had those attributes and that would not have made much of a difference. " <p> At the time, elite East Coast law schools were facing protests from minority students and activists who wanted them to diversify their faculty. But they were not on the lookout for Native American scholars, said Colin S. Diver, who succeeded Mundheim as dean at Penn Law during Warren 's time there. <p> " In Philadelphia and Cambridge, what mattered was African-American and Latino, " Diver said. " That 's where the pressure was coming... and that 's what you meant when you said ' students of color. ' " <p> Whether or not considerations like those should play into law school faculty hiring decisions is a topic for another day. The relevant point here is that it 's quite clear that, in Warren 's case, they did not( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. End of story. <p> Misconduct? No. The Globe also discusses a story that the Breitbart gang is particularly fond of, namely, the accusations of a now-deceased law professor at Rutgers( Warren 's alma mater, ironically), Philip Shuchman, that Warren and her colleagues had committed " scientific misconduct " in some of their bankruptcy research. It is well-known that two independent inquiries cleared Warren and her colleagues, as the Globe notes : <p> Shuchman 's charges were dismissed by both the university of Texas and the National Science Foundation. <p> The University of Texas 's investigation determined that Warren and her coauthors did not engage in scientific misconduct and " their behavior demonstrates the highest ethical standards. " The National Science Foundation also found there was no misconduct and said Shuchman 's complaints amounted to the kind of scholarly dispute best handled in academic journals. <p> The Globe adds some useful context by outlining exactly what it was that Shuchman was complaining about : <p> Writing in the Rutgers Law Review in 1990, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of scientific misconduct, " for failing to make their raw data available to him so he could replicate their findings and verify their accuracy, a standard procedure in the academic world. In his review and in a 60-page complaint to the National Science Foundation, he also alleged that the authors exaggerated the originality of their work by failing to credit others. <p> Shuchman 's charges were grave, akin to academic fraud, and prompted the University of Texas and National Science Foundation to launch investigations. <p> Warren and her collaborators told investigators that they had offered Shuchman a complete list of the cases they sampled, but without the debtors ' names and court file numbers, since that information was never entered into their database. They said they had an agreement with the National Science Foundation to exclude such information, to protect the debtors ' privacy. <p> Sullivan also said they credited Shuchman in their book, calling him a " pioneer " in the field of bankruptcy research, but did not cite much of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies, or wrong. <p> I 'm not one to speak ill of the dead, and Shuchman is no longer around to explain exactly what it was that he was complaining about. Let 's just suffice it to say that, if the Globe 's description is accurate, I 'm not losing any sleep over whether the two inquiries that cleared Warren and her colleagues were some sort of whitewash, as the Breitbart crowd would have you believe. <p> Dr. Phil. When you 're done with the Globe story, you should check out David Bernstein 's piece from earlier this year that discusses Warren 's " Dr. Phil " years. Warren was a regular guest on the immensely popular Dr. Phil show from 2003-2005( she joined the Harvard faculty in 1995) talking about exactly what you would expect : financial issues that affect regular middle-class folk. According to Bernstein, " at the time, she says, not all of her colleagues in the hallowed halls of academia were quite so impressed with her new direction. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not hard to imagine ; one doubts that the Harvard Law faculty boasts too many regular Dr. Phil watchers. But it 's easy to imagine that Warren 's experience with the Dr. Phil audience -- likely quite different from the audiences she was used to in law schools and in government hearing rooms -- is a big part of why she 's been so remarkably successful for a first-time political candidate. <h> Discuss <p>... and because the Dems are banking on a " base " strategy, rather than persuading swing vote -- which clearly is Brown 's plan -- apparently no one want to acknowledge the fact that Warren was a registered Republican from 1991 to ' 96 and refuses to say if she voted for Ronald Reagan or not... which infers that she did. <p> As someone who desperately wants Warren to win, I will embrace and celebrate these facts. Frankly I think the base will vote and be motivated for Warren regardless that she was once a Republican. I understand the base vote strategy, especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from everything I 'm seen, it will be stronger), but I think the Warren camp should " buy a hedge " and embrace her past Republican tendencies so she has a better shot at converting some of the swing voters. <p> Frankly I think the Dems for Brown ads and the " I call 'm as I see 'm " ads of Brown are damn good. I 'd love to see a counter balance from the Warren camp... her looking into the camera... " I was once a Republican( I even voted for Reagan), but as I saw their policies shift and hurt the middle class, I could make that shift... so now I/m a Democratic... still working for the Middle Class " <p> Brown and Warren have got plenty of money for ads and funneling some of that money to present a fuller -- and more accurate -- portrait of Warren would be wish. <p> This is not the bio of a Harvard Law professor. I do n't know what that means, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's definitely one of a kind. I might go to Mass School of Law and then see if I can get a job there. <p> She was hired as a trailing spouse at Penn. Is she ashamed of that? Why does the story gloss over that. <p> You can say " End of Story " to the whole Cherokee business but that will be up to the voters. If it 's so " laughable " then why did she do it? Why did her employers report it? No one has answered that question. <p> She was a Republican until she started working in a place where that was n't fashionable. <p> This " trailing spouse " crap is just part of the smear campaign the right is trying to construct. Obviously you have n't read the article. In fact, if there was a " trailing spouse " it was her husband, who follow Warren to Harvard. <p> Can you provide any " evidence " that she was a " trailing spouse "... put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bio of a Harvard Law professor. Actually, it is. I do n't know what that means, it 's false, so it does n't mean anything but I have been all over their web page and it 's definitely one of a kind. So is she. I might go to Mass School of Law and then see if I can get a job there. Good luck with that -- do let us know how it works out for you. <p> She was hired as a trailing spouse at Penn. That seems to be false, as pogo observes. Is she ashamed of that? Why does the story gloss over that. Because it 's false? Just a guess. <p> You can say " End of Story " to the whole Cherokee business but that will be up to the voters. See my comment upthread If it 's so " laughable " then why did she do it? Why did her employers report it? No one has answered that question. We have answered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like the answers. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson, it appears that you ca n't handle the truth. <p> She was a Republican until she started working in a place where that was n't fashionable. Huh? The Globe says she was registered Republican from 1991-1996. During that time she was teaching at UPenn and Harvard law schools ; not exactly bastions of Republican orthodoxy. <p> You 're usually one of our better differently-winged contributors ; this is a disappointing departure from that. I 'll chalk it up to something you ate. <p> I had put this to bed myself until your comments. I appreciate your nice thoughts but you are an exception on your own blog. Most people here take exception to every letter this keyboard types. You are somewhat more balanced but you are still rooted in your biases, you 're just a better writer. When you say <p> is a big part of why she 's been so remarkably successful for a first-time political candidate. <p> I read " good thing she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer in most other states. " Do you think she 'd be okay in NJ/NY with all that financial services bashing? Would she be okay in a purple state? Obviously she 'd have no chance in her other adopted states, TX and OK. <p> So everyone can bash away. I only bring up a couple flaws that apparently are invisible here, and I bring up once again that it seems an issue that everyone loves the Globe when they agree with it, and hates it when they do n't. <p> All of the following HLS faculty( not lecturers) have at least one not-top-10 degree, so far as I could tell. Keep in mind that the majority of folks listed in the faculty directory are lecturers, and therefore are n't in this list. To be clear, most of the folks below had not-top-ten undergrad but top-10 law, but that does n't change the fact that your claim is just plain balderdash. This is just S-Z, and also excludes professors who do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left leaning Boston Globe being loved/hated here... spot on. <p> With EW being sub-par compared to the rest of HLS 's faculty... spot on. <p> Stomv stepped on a land mine there. I also agree that David was far too tartan in his support of EW and is far too willing to look the other way for the people he supports. I do it too but this is a case of it happening. <p> She 's a nobody who has gone from unimportant Prof at Harvard, picked up by Obama for a job which he could n't even get her confirmed at and now she 's running for US Senator as her first elected position. <p> Her Native American story is total bull and most here would devour a Republican with a similar story. Sorry you guys are too tribal to admit it. <p> While MG and JohnD flog the absurd claim that Elizabeth Warren is some kind of affirmative-action hire, the voters will make their own decision. I have no doubt that some voters will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that those voters already chose to support Scott Brown long ago. <p> These continuing and baseless attacks on Elizabeth Warren -- in the face of compelling evidence to the contrary -- make it easier for truly undecided voters to see what truly motivates the " base " of Scott Brown. <p> Obama won, I 'll live with it. The GOP took back the House in 2010, you 'll live with it, 2012 could bring the Senate back to the GOP or maybe even the POTUS. You and I will have to live with it. <p> I strongly believe in the voters getting what they want, but three indicted Speakers of the House in MA show that sometimes the voters get even more than they want. <p> PS Your zeal is showing using words like " baseless " " unadulterated " and " hogwash " when in fact there is much of EW that we know to be true and other stuff which she has not proven to be false( since we are in the new BMG/Democrat era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did NOT write " gold plated( top 10 or higher) law school pedigrees. " You wrote educational pedigrees. Surely that includes undergraduate. You also wrote " ALL " which means all I 've got to do to prove your statement wrong is find " any ". <p> Had you written " a not-top-10 law degree is exceedingly rare on the Harvard Law faculty " you 'd have been spot on right. You did n't write that though. Hell, you could have written " a significant majority of professors come from top 3 law schools " since the majority of HLS faculty got their law degree from Harvard, and my sense is that a distant number 2 is Yale. You did n't write that either though. Either your research was lazy or your language imprecise, at best. <p> P.S. Jonathan A. Rapping got his law degree from GWU. Joost Pauwelyn seems to have gone to Duke( ranked 11 by USNews). Harry S. Martin got his JD at UofMinnesota, no slouch but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Kristin E. Hickman did her undergrad at Trinity( TX) and her law degree at Northwestern( ranked 12 by USNews). Robert Greenwald did undergrad at Vassar and law school at Northeastern. <p> With respect to top-10, first, you wrote " ALL " and " Harvard Law School faculty " and " education pedigrees ". <p> Then you walked back on " education pedigrees " and changed it to law schools. Then you included undergrad when the law school was n't top 10. Then you excluded visiting professors. Then you " whatever that is " to clinical professors. Then you disregarded Professor Martin because, well, it was yet another example of where your claim was wrong. <p> As I wrote, had you written " most " you 'd have been absolutely right. You did n't. You overclaimed, and I called you out. It 's still true that Elizabeth Warren did n't attend top 10 schools, and it 's true that is a rare thing at Harvard. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My case was and is simply that your claim was wrong. I only needed to cite one example to show that you were wrong. I 've cited a half dozen or so, and with each one you do another backtwist. <p> I thought the complaint about Elizabeth Warren was that she was " elitist " -- Harvard Professor and all. You simultaneously claim that she 's not qualified. Which is it? <p> Frankly, this whole discussion is tiresome. Elizabeth Warren is a nationally-recognized leader on finance reform and associated law. Do you really think you 're going to sway independent voters by attempting to paint her as some kind of fraud? Good luck with that. <p> is the point. Republicans should love this story -- young mom gets herself degrees from a couple of not-highly-ranked state schools, then through sheer force of will and intellect ends up dramatically changing the national conversation on an incredibly important issue to the point where even Harvard Law School could n't fail to notice. Fact is, Warren has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever will in terms of actually affecting the real world. Believe me, I 've suffered through more law review articles than I care to recall. <p> And yet, Republicans are worried that Warren does n't belong on the Harvard faculty because of where she got her degrees. Who knew Republicans were such elitists?( Hint : I did, and so did you.) <p> Translation, Harvard wanted her husband AND hiring her would give them a more diverse faculty( 2 boxes checked). <p> Maybe she helped get her husband the job. <p> Other than that I do like her story, speaking as a Republican. She 's a 1%er and who would n't like someone who makes all the money she does. I think her charitable contributions are a little light( $25K) for someone making what she makes but she does contribute a lot more than Joe Biden 's average $369/year. She takes advantage of legal deductions which you guys only dislike for Republican Presidential candidates( or do you dislike it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with the Consumer protection agency was very good and I am glad someone did what she did. Americans are better off knowing what they are getting into wrt mortgages, credit cards, loans... and banks are on notice to provide transparency or suffer the consequences. THANK YOU EW and I mean it. Too bad your boss( OBAMA) dropped you from heading that agency. He could have made a deal but I guess you were expendable. <p> You 're absolutely right. EWarren went to sucky undergraduate and sucky law school, and very few HLS professors went to sucky one or sucky the other, no less both. I wo n't quibble with " sucky ", since relative to Harvard and Yale, UofHouston and Rutgers are " sucky ". <p> I 'm just not sure why you could n't just write that in the first place, or the second place, or the third place. <p>... now you are changing the subject about her pedigree vs others. You apparently did that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trailing spouse, when she actually was at Harvard for 10 years before her husband was. <p> " I like Elizabeth Warren a lot. She taught me Secured Transactions in law school -- and anyone who can make that subject interesting is certainly worth a look. But although Warren is brilliant and engaging( and she really is), there are at least four reasons she ca n't beat Brown. " link <p> Since then, Warren has risen in the polls and Braceras has n't been as
