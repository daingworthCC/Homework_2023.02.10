5199441 <p> In this Monday 's episode of the ABC series, it 's time to " meet the parents " -- or more accurately have the ' rents spend quality time with each other for the first time since their kids coupled up. But as you can see in the first clip below, you may as well ask oil and water to blend together easily. <p> In the second video, Rick and Kate( thankfully) have been pulled away from the dinner table by the demands of work -- though residual tension nonetheless travels with them as they try to extricate themselves and a mob rat( played by Lost / Mad Men alum Patrick Fischler) from a sticky situation. Bonus : MacGyver reference! <p> nice macguyver reference, i may never have seen the show but references always make me crack up. should be interesting to see them fight, they 've been a bit too loved up this season so their dialogue has n't been quite as snappy as it has in the past but this should sort that <p> ca n't wait to see it. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ricks got good taste in television. <p> P.S. my thoughts exactly Matt, My thoughts excactly. hows the saying go opposites atract. how hilarious would it be to see Beckett and Castles reaction walking in on their parents going at it, alas i think it would be a little to weird if it happened. <p> Ew gross. No Martha/Jim hookup please. I 'd rather Beckett and Castle not be step-siblings if that 's okay. Also, people say " opposites attract " but that 's actually not generally the case. Statistically they do n't work out as often. Castle and Beckett are n't into one another because they 're opposites, they connected because although they seemed very different in the beginning, the more we saw of them, the more it was clear they actually had a lot in common. I think in the long term, Martha would grate on Jim pretty badly, and I do n't really enjoy his character to the degree that I enjoy hers, so
