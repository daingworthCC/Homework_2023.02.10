5182841 <h> PSY Returns in Style with Part One of His Best Sixth <p> PSY is back on the music scene after a two-year break with PSY 's Best Sixth, Part One. Known for his unconventional style in music and presenting himself, especially with the more regulated idol scene rampant in South Korea, PSY is a hoot to listen to and watch perform, as his first SBS Inkigayo stage for title track of this EP, " Gangnam Style, " shows. And who is n't amused by his caricatures? PSY is probably best known for his song " Champion, " released in 2002 around the time of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan. In 2010, PSY joined YG Entertainment, bringing his crazy party sense to lighten up the establishment with " Right Now. " <p> There are six tracks released in Part One of PSY 's Best Sixth, and the second part is slated for release later this year. The tracks feature several artists from fellow labelmate G-Dragon of Big Bang to renowned ballad singer Sung Si-kyung, among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " featuring G-Dragon. It starts off with simple notes played against synths. It builds a little with some drums and electric guitar when PSY 's rich voice starts. The vocals take a turn towards rock, adding a gravelly bit that fits the changes in instruments. The entire track is upbeat and full of energy, which starts the album off right. Honestly, when G-Dragon begins rapping, as much as I like his work, it just was n't anything notable. It is n't until he takes the pitch down and inserts a raspier sound into his rap -- around 2:45 in the audio -- that his input fits the rest of the song. From then until the end of the song, his voice is well-integrated and fits the song, even present in the final vocalizations, ending the song forcefully, very much in contrast to the peaceful start. <p> The second song is " Hot Goodbye " featuring Sung Si-kyung. The song starts with PSY 's autotuned voice introducing the song. The background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with manufactured sounds. Sung Si-kyung 's contribution to the song stands out above the music and PSY 's voice, grabbing attention. His parts sound suited for a traditional ballad, but they are even more outstanding because of the unconventional background. And of course, his vocals qualify for superior marks, as always. PSY 's raps have good rhythm and speed, moving the song along well. Sung Si-kyung ends the song with his well known, low-pitched, " sleep well. " Though the song is for dance, there is a light melancholic overtone, suitable for a goodbye, as the title indicates. <p> The third track is " Gangnam Style. " It 's the only song on the EP that does not feature other artists, and suitably so as this is the title track. <p> From the teasers for the music video, this song has a hook like no other : " Oppan Gangnam Style! " That one line alone, the way it 's said and echoed gets stuck in anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reappears. It 's also the first line said in the song, setting up the listener for its repeats later. There 's a strong house beat accompanied by varied electronic sounds that fluctuate with PSY 's pitch. The rapping, talking, and singing are brimming with confidence and power, making the song a great listen and a true star on the album. The track also is firmly within PSY 's style without being redundant within his discography. The fourth song is " Seventy-Seven 101, " featuring LeeSsang and Kim Jin-pyo. Though announcing singers or composers of a song can get annoying at times, PSY does that at the very beginning in a catchy manner. All four artists involved in the song have an equal part to shine : signs of a good collaboration. PSY 's the first to rap in a calm manner with sharp words. LeeSsang 's Gil moans the chorus with " Do you remember " and ad-libs. Kim Jin-pyo is the next to rap with his style -- expressively-said words and varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his swag overflowing into the song in his lazy-sounding style. Little piano notes are excellent accents along with the backtrack that features high-pitched back singing in a style that 's a throwback to past songs, very fitting considering the chorus. The entire song is full of nostalgia and carries itself calmly and respectably. Fifth is " What Should Have Been, " featuring Park Jung-hyun, also known as Lena Park. The song a faster-paced ballad with clear R &B; influences. The music is simple, letting PSY and Park Jung-hyun rap and sing to their heart 's content. In comparison to the rest of the EP, this track is a letdown. It sounds like an older song, but does n't have the pizzazz normally associated with PSY. While it could be considered a welcome change as a smooth song with pleasant vocals, it really does n't bring anything interesting. <p> The last song is " Never Say Goodbye, " featuring Yoon Do-hyun. <p> A rock song, this fuses Yoon Do-hyun 's style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts the song off, followed by PSY, both singing with a simple piano background. It gives the appearance of a ballad at the start, but the introduction of instruments later on along with purposeful gravelly voices and strains instantly transforms the song into a rock ballad of sorts. The interplay between quiet and loud in the song creates stark contrasts that keep the song interesting. The entire song rings with a sense of finality, fitting as it 's the last song of the EP. <p> Part One of PSY 's Best Sixth displays PSY 's ability to create music and collaborate with others to mix styles in an interesting way. The six songs manage to touch on different genres of music, some to a more successful level that others. What 's consistent, aside from PSY, is that 2/3 of the songs are on the sadder side -- the first and third tracks are too explosive and upbeat to ever be sad. It seems to be an experimental attempt to see how well PSY 's obvious style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can produce. On this album, it was nice to see an explosive title track. Often, some albums have catchier or just better tracks that are n't promoted, but I think " Gangnam Style " is the shining star and is the one that defines PSY best. Overall, I give Part One a 4.5/5. <p> I own all of Psy 's albums and this is by far his worst, I ca n't even convey how disappointed I am. Gangnam Style epitomised this for me, it 's as though he just thought ' forget making any good music, if i just stuff it full of celebrities people will be bound to love it. ' Not to be a mainstream hater but this is the first time I can remember two albums in such quick succession so I hope it 's not YG forcing him to create this crap. <p> On the plus side Never Say Goodbye is fantastic and the style is something I would never really associate with him. Still Korea 's best live performer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like this again. <p> http : //twitter.com/adhsty Stevani Adhisty <p> well maybe because it 's just part 1 of his album, let 's hope the part 2 is better. But actually I enjoyed Gangnam Style MV and stage. I agree that he 's the best performer in Korea, his energy never drops and he always owns the stage. <p> CJux <p> Quite frankly I doubt he 'll ever be able to produce another album that tops the masterpiece that was "?? ", but I 'm still pleased with this album and I disagree with you about Gangnam Style. PSY still maintains his quality as a non-idol who is able to transform pop culture into an artistic product wrapped in sarcasm, the difference now is that his sound was updated to ultra-modern trends. <p> nhoki <p> Gangnam Style is really catchy but just like you, I think Right Now is a much better song -- I still do n't get why it was not that well received. I do n't know if you have read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time, one of his song( Gangnam style) topped all the online charts, and he seemed happy about it so it 's all good I think.. Gangnam style is not that bad, it 's a great song for summer <p> sleptopia <p> Also bear in mind that I look at his music with a view to his liver performances being most important as well. I 've been to see him 5 times now so ' Right Now ' is far better in this regard, I 'd have to say that ' We are the ones ' is probably best and he usually uses it to climax( though it does feel slightly odd from a foreigner 's perspective singing along with it.) <p> Call me a hipster but I guess this album and Gangnam style in particular seems to just be ' Kpopified '( hence the popularity, celebrities and the fact that almost every track is a collab) and is drifting away from his own art direction to be more in line with YGs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part 1 at least) is that PSY wants to modernize his sound and break some past trends while maintaining some of his characteristic traits. While he was able to do that with Gangnam Style, with an MV that looks more like a parody of K-pop 's formula of success, he 's still stuck with some old sounds that no longer feel innovative. That 's at least why I think " What Should Have Been " and to some extent " Seventy-Seven 101 " feel insipid and a tad boring in an album that has " Green Frog ", " Gangnam Style " and one of the best ballads of the year, " Never Say Goodbye ". <p> But I 'd rather wait for the second part of the album before I start overly praising him or criticizing him. So far I 'm pleased with the result. Thanks for the review! <p> ggoma <p> Never Say Goodbye is a rather hopeful song to me, I did n't feel like it was an ending but a circle back to the @ @ @ @ @ @
