5144741 <p> Much like Oregon State hates being called the " little brother ' ' in its rivalry with the Oregon Ducks, the Portland Timbers do n't really appreciate the Seattle Sounders pounding their chests and looking down their noses at their bitter rival. <p> So yeah, it did n't go unnoticed when Sounders coach Sigi Schmid told USA Today, " there 's something of a little bit of big brother being Seattle and a little bit of Portland... the people are a little more nature lovers or whatever you want to call it. ' ' <p> Portland( 3-6-4, 13 points) and Seattle( 7-4-4, 25 points after tonight 's 1-1 draw with Kansas City) meet Sunday at Jeld-Wen Field, and no one could blame the struggling-to-score Timbers if they had a slight inferiority complex to deal with. <p> This might be the most intense rivalry in U.S. soccer -- and Portland is hoping previous results do n't matter a lick -- but there is likely to be some high anxiety at Jeld-Wen as fans wonder if the Timbers team that did a homefield faceplant against Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given is that Sunday 's game will have a slightly different atmosphere. <p> " The home games I 've seen, every game 's been incredible so I do n't really see how you can top that, ' ' said Timbers ' fullback Steven Smith after Wednesday 's training session. <p> " But they said it 's a special game, and it 's something I 'm looking forward to. As a player, these are the games you want to play in. ' ' <p> Smith, who just got back to town after getting married, knows full well how fans react before and after a game with their hated rival. He 's been involved in one of soccer 's most famous rivalry games, the grudge match between Rangers and Celtics in Scotland. <p> " That 's a massive game, it 's known all over the world, and I 've been fortunate enough to have played in a few of them, ' ' he said. " I 've won a few and I 've lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games like the one back home and the one Sunday, it 's a much better feeling to be on the winning end. ' ' <p> Timbers midfielder Jack Jewsbury said he did n't get the full impact of what Seattle-Portland means until he arrived in Seattle last season before a rain-soaked 1-1 draw that Schmid whined about for days, prompting a comical give-and-take with Portland coach John Spencer. <p> " The reality of it is, I do n't think any of us realized until you were a part of it last year how big these games are, not only for us as players but for the fans and the organizations, ' ' said Jewsbury. <p> " Until you step on the field for those games and get those goose bumps, it 's one of those things that 's really hard to speak about. ' ' <p> Jewsbury remembered the Schmid-Spencer show last season and smiled. " You 're always going to have that back and forth, ' ' he said. " After the game( in Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all excited about it, but at the end of the day( Sunday) is a huge game for both clubs and I think it could be a huge momentum builder for us going into this second half of the season. ' ' <p> If the Sounders -- at least the Sounders coach -- went the crybaby route after the 1-1 draw, it was the Timbers who were in tears after blowing two second-half leads in the rematch at Jeld-Wen and losing 3-2. <p> " Yeah, it was tough, I think that 's something at least that 's been on my mind for quite a while, ' ' said Jewsbury. " For us to get those leads and give them up is something we 're not too proud of but at the end of the day we want to continue to press the game, especially here at home. ' ' <p> Jewsbury said the Cal FC debacle and the Timbers ' scoring slump will not detract from Sunday 's match. " I think guys are going to be flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's going to be tight, especially in the firset 15 minutes as it normally is against them. <p> " We 've just got to settle down, continue to create chances and believe that we have the players -- which we do -- to get things going in the right direction. I think if we continue to go forward like we did against( Los Angeles) and create those chances, we 're going to find the back of the net. ' ' <p> A cynic might suggest this current Portland team could n't find the back of the net with a team of search dogs, but Jewsbury said one goal early against the Sounders -- who have been struggling themselves -- might open the floodgates. <p> " It 's one of those things that happens in this sport, ' ' he said. " Strikers go through those times and midfielders as well where everything 's going in that they teach, and then there 's times where it seems like you ca n't hit the frame. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kind of right the ship. ' ' <p> Smith was asked about Portland 's inability to " hit the frame ' ' and he said he did n't detect any head-hanging when he came back from his wedding. " I would n't say the camp is unhappy, ' ' he said. " I mean, it 's more of a problem if you were n't playing well and you were n't getting the chances.... once one goes in, there will be more to follow.
