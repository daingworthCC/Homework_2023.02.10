5164041 <h> Movie weekend : Lincoln and Red Dawn <p> I 'm usually only able to go to movie theaters when seeing kiddie movies, but if I were able to make it to the movie theater for a more mature film, I 'd want to see Lincoln. I read the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin a few years back, and this movie is based in part on that book. It is an excellent book, and I 'd love to see it on screen. I 'm most inspired by David Brooks 's piece Why We Love Politics : <p> I hope everybody who shares this anti-political mood will go out to see " Lincoln, " directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner. The movie portrays the nobility of politics in exactly the right way. <p> It shows that you can do more good in politics than in any other sphere. You can end slavery, open opportunity and fight poverty. But you can achieve these things only if you are willing to stain your own character in order to serve others -- if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery and hypocritical. <p> The Goodwin book was very similar to this. They talk about how Lincoln played his Cabinet against one another, taking their faults and bamboozling them while taking advantage of their talents, for the greater good. <p> In real life Lincoln used the n-word. Spielberg 's Lincoln does not -- even though others in the film do. <p> In real life Lincoln said stuff like this : <p>... there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. <p> Spielberg 's Lincoln never says stuff like that. He is for equal rights! This is no longer history, but fantasy. Lincoln was against giving blacks the vote till the last week of his life, and even then it would only be for veterans and the " very intelligent " -- Jim Crow stuff. <p> In real life Lincoln was for ethnic cleansing. He wanted to send blacks away after the war -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out of it. <p> Douglass 11 years after Lincoln 's death said : <p> President Lincoln was a white man, and shared the prejudices common to his countrymen towards the coloured race. <p> I 'm not black, so it 's hard for me to judge. My non-black opinion, however, is that Lincoln was just a product of his times and that for a movie -- as opposed to a book -- a filmmaker needs to a focus on just a small number of issues rather than every single issue that a character dealt with. Lincoln 's wife was also a really hard person to get along with, plus Lincoln dealt with depression, plus he was perhaps the only introvert who has ever been POTUS. I 'm not sure how well the film dealt with all these issues. In film, too many issues complicate the storyline. But this movie would be first on my list if I were in a position to see movies. <p> Last on my list of movies these days would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> The " home of the brave? " Do White people have some sort of monopoly on bravery? It would seem so from the poster above. <p> Marissa 's review continues : <p> The main character of the film is Matt Eckert, a white all-American football player played woodenly by a doleful Josh Peck. His older brother, Jed, is a second Gulf War veteran played by white Australian actor Chris Hemmsworth( now famous for his leading role in Marvel 's Thor). After seeing their father senselessly executed by General Lo( Will Yun Lee), the two brothers and their friends hide out in the woods, learn how to fight back in a montage sequence, and begin to take on the invaders head on. <p> Charitably, the film includes characters of color as residents of Spokane, including the father of Connor Cruise 's character, Daryl : the city 's mayor is portrayed by an actor of color, Michael Beach The mayor is depicted as wimping out and traitorously appeasing the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the group is joined by two out-of-towner siblings, Julie( Alyssa Diaz) and Greg( Julian Alcaraz). Yay... diversity? <p> Except, uh... All of the Wolverines of color die except for one.( And even that is left kind of nebulous because he is left by the others to die alone due to his own careless stupidity, even though white characters are equally careless and never face that consequence.) Contrast that to how all of the white Wolverines survive to the end of the film, except for one, even though the group started out with more white characters than characters of color. The problem with this film is that although characters of color share the screen with characters who are white, they are never depicted as equally as competent or equally as important as the white characters. <p> I liked the original Red Dawn when it came out during the ' 80? s. But that one was n't ethnic -- the bad guys and good guys were the same color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities are used to seeing : White heroes, rich and complex White lives, deep and endearing White love, and a bunch of stock minority characters that get used and murdered for
