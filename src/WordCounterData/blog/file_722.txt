5180741 <h> CD Review and Giveaway!!! : Love All The Way by Brittany Hargest <p> When I played Love All The Way for 12 year old, the first words out of her mouth were, " Mom, I want this on my iPod as soon as possible. " Four days later, she is still asking for me to play this recording every time we get in the car. Both of my daughters love this new recording by Brittany Hargest. <p> My first impression when I started the music was that it seemed a little jumpy. My daughter responded to my thoughts with " Mom, that 's not jumpy. It 's high energy. " Okay -- high energy -- that works. Not all of the songs are quite as driven, but the first two songs and several others on the recording would make excellent running music.( Slow Motion and Critical) My husband is a runner, and he agreed with this assessment. <p> Overall, I am very impressed with the music and lyrics of this cd. Although it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to Love All The Way quite a bit because I love finding music that my daughters love and that encourages their faith. <p> My favorite song on the album is I Believe In You. With a somewhat funky melody and accompaniment sometimes reminiscent of the background music in an alien movie, I Believe In You was not the song I thought would be my favorite. However, the lyrics really imprinted onto my mind and met me where I am. " It do n't really matter what the world can bring, cause I believe in you. " <p> My Bottom Line : I would recommend this album to anyone looking for modern, upbeat Christian music. <p> Giveaway Details : <p> The comments on this blog post will be used in a random drawing on November 3rd.
