5132741 <p> Taylor Swift is always writing songs about the guys in her life, but we rarely hear of any of them writing a response song. Of course, not all of the guys she 's been involved with are musicians, but it 's always interesting to come across a song that 's dedicated to Taylor herself! <p> When singer Adam Young of Owl City found out that Taylor 's song " Enchanted " was about the time she met him, he wanted to tell her how he could n't forget their meeting, either. He recorded a cover of " Enchanted, " rewriting the lyrics to basically say, " I was enchanted to meet you, too ". You can hear some of his own electronic sound in the audio as well. Adam included a Valentine 's Day note to Taylor with the song, which was totally adorable even though she never publicly responded to it. <p> Rapper Sammy Adams recently recorded his own remix of " I Knew You Were Trouble, " including an original verse dedicated to Tay! We heard that Sammy actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up with a bit of a crush on her. He raps some super romantic lines in the remix, like how " some say they 'd sell their soul for a couple hits/ i 'd rather live/ a life of gold/ with the perfect chick ". Sounds like Sammy Adams may have fallen big time! <p> Not all songs dedicated to Taylor are super sweet though. The Jonas Brothers were n't exactly enchanted when they heard " Forever &; Always, " which was about Joe Jonas ' breakup with Tay. The first few lines of their song " Much Better " are " I get a rep for breakin ' hearts/ Now I 'm done with superstars/ And all the tears on her guitar/ I 'm not bitter ". Ouch! That 's a direct reference to one of Taylor 's first hits, " Teardrops on My Guitar "( but that song was n't about anyone famous). <p> Which of these responses to Taylor 's songs
