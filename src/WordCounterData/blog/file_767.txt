5185341 <h> SmartGlass App for Controlling Your Xbox Has a Few Holes <p> One of the most frustrating experiences with using Apple TV, Xbox and almost any other Internet-connected set-top box is text entry. <p> The moment you need to use a conventional remote control or game controller to enter words or numbers -- for a password, say, or to search for a television show on Netflix -- is the second when turning off the television and cleaning the bathroom starts to sound more appealing. <p> A person who has worked with Microsoft 's Xbox group told me recently that text entry consistently comes up in user tests as one of the greatest annoyances people have when using applications on the Xbox( this person did n't want to jeopardize his relationship with Microsoft by being named). <p> So it was exciting to see the release of Xbox SmartGlass, an app for smartphones and tablets that lets people control their Xboxes with all the flexibility and features offered by a touch screen, rather than with the Xbox game controller.

Oddly, though, the app allowed me to enter text from a keyboard on the iPad for Bing searches, Web addresses in Internet Explorer and messages to other Xbox Live members. <p> Microsoft says the reason for this is that Netflix, YouTube and other partners need to update their apps for Xbox to support text entry from a keyboard.
