5153041 <p> Do you have stubborn areas of fat that are sticking around despite your best diet and exercise efforts? This complaint is one that plastic surgeons frequently hear. It is possible to have areas of fat that diet and exercise do n't resolve, especially as you age. In these instances, liposuction can help you get the sleek physique you 're after. Here are three areas of the body that respond particularly well to this cosmetic surgery treatment : <p> Stomach <p> The stomach is notorious for retaining excess fat, even after you 've achieved a normal weight. A stomach pooch is a common complaint for women after they 've given birth, but anyone can be affected by stubborn fat in this area. Liposuction can be combined with a tummy tuck or performed on its own on to help you achieve the flat tummy that sit-ups are n't delivering. <p> Chin <p> The chin is not the first place people think of getting liposuction, but the procedure can be very useful in resolving the dreaded double chin. The shapes of some people 's faces leave them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at a normal weight. Fortunately, liposuction can remove fat cells from that area, creating the look of a tight and toned chin. <p> Arms <p> Women in particular struggle with firming the underside areas of their arms. Sometimes, no amount of arm curls will create a toned appearance on the arms, even when you can feel the muscle growing underneath. Liposuction can get rid of the excess fat in the arms so that your muscle tone shines through. For particularly stubborn cases, an arm lift can be combined with liposuction to give you the sleek, sexy arms you have always wanted. <p> Although these three body parts are significantly improved by liposuction, the cosmetic surgery procedure can be used nearly anywhere on your body to reshape your figure.
