5136041 <p> On the most recent episode of the DIS Unplugged Podcast we discussed several rumors, ranging from new X-Pass attractions to a feud between Bob Iger and John Lasseter. A few things have already materialized ; continue after the break to find out what has already come to fruition. <p> We 'll start out with an update on Splittsville, the new bowling alley going into the old Virgin Megastore location at Downtown Disney 's West Side. Splittsville wo n't be just the typical bowling alley. Instead, guests will be able to order a full gourmet meal and enjoy music and entertainment at night. Yesterday, new concept art of the interior was released by Disney : <p> As you can see, this is meant to be an upscale bowling experience. Splittsville currently has Fall 2012 listed as an opening date. Stay tuned for more detailed information in the near future! <p> Next up, we discussed the release of a new " My Disney Experience " app on the News, Housekeeping and Rapidfire segment of the show.

Speculation is this app will lead us into the X-Pass system and possibly ticketless entry. Whatever Disney has in store, this new app and the free wi-fi being rolled out to the parks is the next step towards the Next Gen initiative. <p> Lastly, we discussed the rumored reopening of Mannequins Dance Palace and Comedy Warehouse on the Rumors segment of the DIS Unplugged. The reopening apparently has a costuming budget allocated for it and is set to take place before the end of the year. On the show, I indicated I refuse to believe anything until I see proof of the clubs being readied for operation or a significant source steps forward to reaffirm the rumor. As of this writing, I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always the case, Disney can change their mind, but a new source has come forward with reliable and " close to the action " information. Of course, I 'll be watching this one closely. <p> Are you excited for Splittsville? Do you want to reserve your ride times from home with the new X-Pass system?
