5195241 <p> The green-colored number( FPS : Frames per second) indicates the frame of the targeted screen( Games, streaming videos). If you ca n't see the green FPS numbers, please see the solutions below : <p> 1. Start Bandicam before the recording target Bandicam can provide good FPS recognition when it is run " before the target program ". - It is recommended to run the Bandicam program " ahead of the target program " as much as possible. <p> 3. Use the ' DirectX/OpenGL window ' mode Only when the target is produced in the ' DirectX/OpenGL ' window, the green-colored numbers( FPS) will be shown. - If you use ' Rectangle on a screen ' mode, the green-colored numbers( FPS) will not be shown <p> 4. Play a video in full screen If the recording target is a video, you may have to play the video in full screen to see the green FPS numbers. <p> Hello, here is my version of the problem : If I run Bandicam before the game it has next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game, minimize it, then run Bandicam and immediately after that restore the game, Bandicam will recognize it. If I minimize the game again, maybe do some other stuff and return to the game, Bandicam can no longer detect it. Then I have to close Bandicam and open it again and it 's all fine. Sometimes Bandicam will stop recognizing the game while it 's recording it and I have to manually open Bandicam and hit the " stop " button. <p> It acts like this on all games I 've tried. This includes " Bastion ", " Rayman Origins " and " Amnesia : The Dark Descent "( games from Steam) and " Street Fighter X Tekken ". I play Amnesia in windowed mode, so screen mode does n't seem to matter. All of these games can be minimized normally, but can not start
