5181641 <h> The things that can ' bug ' you while traveling <p> We loooove to travel. As far as I am concerned you can never go away too often or too far. There is such a thing as being too curious or traveling too primitive though. When I was younger we were lucky enough to have parents that took us to France, Germany and Luxemburg but that was as far as the journey took us. My mum hated any type of transportation. A plane was an absolute no-go, trains were only barely tolerated and a car, well... only if there was no other option. <p> Our transportation in Costa Rica <p> It was even so that when we were still very young( somewhere between 5 and ten years of age) my dad would go with the car to our holiday home in Egmond or Noordwijk( which are both seaside towns in the Netherlands) and mum and me would follow on the scooter. It was quite a drive but she would do anything to avoid having to sit in a car for an hour. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers license which was at a very late age, as I can still remember my mum getting her drivers license! So needless to say we never traveled anywhere outside of Europe and even then within a 800 km range from our home. <p> Since my mum got her permit so late, it was n't before I was 15 years old that we took our first trip to France, which was a big adventure. First of all for my mum who always had a sick-bag at the ready, just in case and secondly for all of us who had not been further then Germany. France was exotic, new and exciting. We saw Paris! We climbed the Eiffeltower! <p> Bananatree <p> But it took me a lot more years before I finally made my first trip outside of Europe. Our first ' tropical ' destination was Mexico. Yucatan to be more precise. At that time, we are now talking 15 years ago, Mexico was in my mind a huge adventure. Scary too and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week and then the second week we would spend in a hotel in a place called Cancun. Had I known what I know today I would probably have picked a different destination as Cancun is really not the most beautiful spot in Mexico to stay but what did I know? Our first week was fantastic, we saw a lot, experienced our first tropical rainstorm and we even saw a few insects along the way that we had never seen before. Nothing too dramatic though. It was a well organized fly-drive with good hotels. Clean hotels... <p> But then.... our friends P and M convinced us we should go with them on a group tour to Costa Rica. I hardly even knew at the time where Costa Rica was! Had to look it up to find out that it was located in Middle America, next to Honduras and well, not too far from Mexico. We booked the trip with Baobab, as that sounded fairly safe, we did n't have the added hassle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip. <p> And while we did enjoy it immensely and even went back to Costa Rica ten years later, that very first night in the jungle I will never forget! We stayed in this charming little lodge by the Tortuguero river. Tortuguero is a gorgeous place with lots of wildlife but at the time,( we 're talking 2001) there were a lot less tourist accommodations then there are today. Our cabins were basic. Very very basic... They were on stilts( or would you call that poles?) and we had a few wooden steps to lead us to the ' porch ' and then into the cabin which was not much more then four wooden walls, a roof and a bed. There were so many cracks everywhere in the cabin that I was VERY happy with our mosquito net. But hey, all good... we did come for some adventure... <p> Tom and me in front of the cabin in Tortuguero <p> Ofcourse that evening, after dinner, the stories started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall to pick up our flashlights and came back with tales of giant insects, ant colonies and huge spiders IN the cabins which did not make me feel very confident I could actually sleep... We went to bed really early, I think it must have been 9 pm, and boy was I nervous! I checked our mosquito net 3 times, tucked it all in around us and shone the flashlight around the bed to make sure all was in order. I completely avoided looking anywhere else in the ' room ' as I am pretty sure I would seen lots of things I did not want to see! We had made sure our luggage was secured in plastic and all zippers closed. Making it as difficult as possible for any insects to crawl in. <p> But as happens when I am rather nervous, after about ten minutes I had to pee. And in order to do that, I would have to turn on the flashlight, find my glasses, put on my shoes( after tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clothing, get out the door, down the stairs, across the field to a wooden shed of sorts which was the only place in the entire vicinity with lights blazing all night, do my thing and then follow that whole routine in reverse. Do you know what happens when the lights are on in an otherwise dark jungle area? Yep... filled with creatures! <p> Toilet and shower area <p> That night I had to pee three times!! After that I was sort of over the whole insect thing... It just stopped bothering me. We had to, or else we would have gone mad. You just take your precautions, do what you have to do to make sure they do n't get anywhere you do n't want them to and get over it. It 's really that simple! So while sleeping in insect rich rooms is still not very high on my list of fun things, it is sometimes inevitable. <p> And then this is what you find in the shower early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we -- at least -- have the luxury to choose for something like that, while the people living there have to endure it day after day for the rest of their lifes. it does put things into perspective! <p> Tarantula at night <h> Share this : <h> Comments <p> This is why I have a rule that I can never go anywhere there are spiders large enough to see their eyes without a magnifying glass. This rules out a lot of the world but it also keeps me from needing
