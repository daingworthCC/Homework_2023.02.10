5201741 <p> Then what you want is this Isthmus forum thread. 250 posts long, but well worth it, especially for Meade fans who want to see what happens when he sojourns where his style and pithiness are not appreciated. <p> People whose everyday lives are certain struggles. I find I am received when I address them directly, " Hey, your sock fell off, " to the guy whose leg is missing and negotiating the elevator door. " That 's quite a wheelchair you 've got there, " to the only handicapped person at a party, and that opened up a whole space of conversation that other people entered. And then at the store, " I 'd be happy to reach that for you, " to the lady with the grabby thing in another motorized wheelchair, and " Mind the gap, " to the klutz clanging on crutches. Oh, and " Help! Help! Somebody help me, I 've been captured! Help! Help! I ca n't get free. Help. Help. Pretty please with sugar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded kid who clamped onto my sleeve in passing and held tight to it. I almost forgot about that, his mother was appalled at that but her kid laughed his little ass off. I could have yanked free but it was fun. I have this knack for dropping right into Learninghandicappedville, like that, *snap*. It 's a gift. <p> That Stranger article is pretty appalling. I 've only seen a lesser version of this on support boards for a specific illness, where people who have never been to a doctor are " convinced " that they have that illness. It 's an odd, odd phenomenon. <p> Ha! I was just screwing around, I had no idea Meade had actually smoked the faker out. Nice work! <p> I 've had the misfortune of being friends with two different drama queens who were always about to drop dead. One of them has been dying for over twenty years of various undisclosed medical vagaries. The other one grew out of it. I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard from both of them all the time was " I 'm probably not going to be around much longer. " <p> My position on people like this, including just plain old trolls, is that they actually do have a problem, just a different one than they pretend, so it does n't matter. They have a psychological issue and no doubt need that extra attention. <p> It 's similar to someone begging in the street. I would n't particularly feel used if their entire story was concocted to feed a drug addiction because standing that is not a particularly wonderful place to be in either. <p> I was a long time poster on an infertility site. Women who eventually did have children would stay to discuss their parenting after infertility issues. There were multiple fakers. One woman faked an entire full term twin pregnancy. Another woman had children and then claimed that an Amber alert had just been issued because her daughter was missing. Problem is that Amber alerts can be easily verified -- you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't. <p> " Speaking of Mormons, I note that Instapundit linked an article mentioning that Japanese domestic sales of adult diapers surpassed those for infants. " <p> Yes, that 's the real problem. If people become too rational, they wo n't have children. If the group had a rational mind, it would encourage irrationality in its members. The group does n't have a mind, but it 's as if it does. Hence, lots of Mormons! <p> Hilarious comment string. Meade wins early when the ad hominem unconscionable dickwad is flung his way. That is just so much more fulfilling than " asshole " or whatever. <p> It seems the rest of the thread is more about silencing Meade than anything else. Why do these self anointed progressive thinkers, who once upon a time in the 60 's, demanded the right to dissent and now seek to silence any dissent. <p> Update : 10/13/12 : Just am update! I am doing OK, was in much pain so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fifth landed me in a 3 day coma... Recovering now but have almost no internet... While in coma they did tons of lung treatments and my one lung is now at 60% other at 80% and no sign of decline... Docs said I would be dead or brain dead, once again they were wrong thankfully... Looks like I will once again beat the odds... <p> An average 70% of lung capacity working is not at death 's door, folks. You usually do n't even require supplemental oxygen until 40%. <p> Aridog, you 're assuming he 's telling the truth. Do n't play the game. I 'd bet just about anything he 's never had anything worse than a bad cold. <p> Re : Crack - he 's crazy. I 'll bet he 's a swell guy IRL( in fact I think I met him back in the 80s, if he was in the Beatnigs at that time) but he 's still crazy. Batshit, foaming-at-the-mouth, off-his-fucking-rocker crazy. If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at very least, one of the brain-dead masses who voluntarily dopes themselves up, rendering pure comprehension of the Gospel According To Crack Emcee incomprehensible. <p> Trust me, I 'm not playing any of SJ 's games... merely noting that his statement vis a vis his lungs is bullcrap in a clinical sense... just like most of everything else he says. Even a half-wit would use Google to get some clinical facts correct in their otherwise fabricated story. In other words, SJ has reached that pinnacle where he believes his own BS. <p> My clinical knowledge vis a vis lungs and capacity is real event based, personal, and part of the decision process I had to use in determining what form of treatment I wanted. I am in fact surviving quite nicely with 40% lung capacity. <p> I 'd never entertain him by responding...
