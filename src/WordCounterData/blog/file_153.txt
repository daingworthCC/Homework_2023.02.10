5123341 <p> For the second time in recent months, a pair of LPGA stars have engaged in a slapping match via the social medium known as Twitter. <p> A few months ago, it was Sophie Gustafson and Cristie Kerr hitting at each other over Kerr 's refusal to sign some piece of memorabilia that Gustafson was donating to a charity event. That feud quickly drifted into personalities. <p> This week, it was Britanny Lincicome and Christina Kim doing the " Oh, yeah, says who? " routine over Twitter over, well, apparently over frustration. <p> Lincicome, in Malaysia for the LPGA event there last week, has struggled through a frustrating year. During a rain delay, she tweeted that if it kept raining, she would n't have to go back out and play. <p> Kim, frustrated over her own poor play that saw her not get into the Malaysian field, tweeted that anyone should feel grateful for the chance to be playing the LPGA event and that plenty of people would love to have the chance. And there was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before everyone calmed down and the tweets were delayed, long after anyone who cared had a chance to see them. <p> So why do these kinds of feuds erupt on Twitter? Well, there is that aspect of Twitter that allows you to say things to people without actually having to say it to their face. And there is the immediacy of Twitter, meaning that any knee-jerk, emotional outburst can find itself on the site in 140 blazing characters before someone has a chance to stop and think. <p> The LPGA players are n't the only athletes or even golfers who have feuded with other players or fan on Twitter. Paul Azinger 's conservative politics certainly had draw the ire of many other Twitter uses, though Azinger seems more than willing to fire back at attacks. Rickie Fowler has had dust-ups with people wondering just why he is so popular and gets so many endorsements given he has just one win. <p> I hope not to get into those kinds of feuds on my Twitter account, @MyDesertGolf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been the golf writer for The Desert Sun since 1986 and I 'm the author of " 50 Years of Hope ", a history of the Bob Hope Classic.
