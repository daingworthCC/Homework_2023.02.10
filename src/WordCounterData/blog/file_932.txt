5202241 <p> It appears that the climate toward Mitt Romney in Europe is warming up, as his chances of victory improve. For Germany 's business daily Handelsblatt, columnist Wolfram Weimer writes that even if Romney is more talk than action when it comes to ties to Europe, he will likely be better for the old world than Obama, who has few ties to Europe, favors fiscal policies at odds with Berlin, and is more likely to let NATO ' languish ' than reinvigorate it. <p> In Germany four years ago, Barack Obama would have been able to count on 80 to 90 percent of the vote. To Germans, after the leaden Bush years, the new president seemed hip, smart, empathetic, and liberal -- and altogether more European than his Texan predecessor. Today, German enthusiasm for Obama has significantly cooled. Many of his promises -- from the closure of Guantanamo to climate change targets to economic recovery -- have not been kept. And in many ways, his style of governance appears to be oriented toward sound bites and show. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Europe, and is particularly distant toward Germany. <p> From a German perspective, therefore, a victory for Mitt Romney would have its advantages. Whereas Obama is urging Germany to introduce euro bonds, and thus open market financing of Europe 's debt mountain, Romney is pursuing a course more in line with that of Angela Merkel. To tackle the U.S. debt crisis, Obama has followed an aggressive course of deficit spending, and recommends that Europe do the same -- up to and including setting central bank policy and boosting the printing of money. <p> In the U.S., the national debt has now surpassed the $16 trillion mark. When Obama took office in 2009, the total debt stood at $10.6 trillion. Thus, in only four years, his administration has created more debt than the total debt owed by Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland over the course of an entire generation. Obama 's plans therefore no longer correspond with Merkel 's notions of sound fiscal policy. <h> Sponsors <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one guy out of 80 million that would prefer Romney. Considering that the green party is slowly taking over the country, it is a bit silly to say that Germans would prefer any republican. <p> You really have to read the rest of this piece( which may have been written by Pat Buchanan in disguise). Here 's some more : <p> There is staggeringly little in his biography and few of his cultural interests that connect him with the old world, he rarely seeks the advice of his allies, avoids visits and is more likely to allow NATO to languish than redefine it. <p> It 's very different with Romney : his family comes from Northwest England, in his youth he lived in France for two years, he even speaks passable French and he sees himself as being firmly anchored in the transatlantic tradition. <p> I can see how Angela Merkel would love Romney 's financial philosophy ; they have the same bent as Joe Scarborough 's idol Maggie Thatcher. <p> Nah... Merkel would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures are based in the belief that the greeks will not be able to " work " themselves out of this mess, so they have to cut spending. <p> She is just trying to protect the German tax payer. Not to mention that savings, insurance, and regulations
