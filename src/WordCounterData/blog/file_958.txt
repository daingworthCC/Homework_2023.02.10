That 's exactly what I 'm feel right now. I 've had such crazy day until I read the news that he 's back from his great adventure! He 's now in the city and I there 's a feeling that I ca n't describe through words. So I grabbed my guitar, wrote down some words, and made a song about it. But for now, I can only show you half of it. It 's called Glad to See You :) <p> when the storm 's reaching you / and you finally get down / when the god 's telling you / right now he 's around / that 's when you feel happy / mesmerizing by the new look you will see / and there just suddenly / memories are shining bright / dream about it all night / it was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say // CHORUS / i remember / how tight i grabbed your back / i remember / all the laughs that we had / you 're no longer / a boy with an innocence heart
