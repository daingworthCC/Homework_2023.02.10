5206541 <p> There is a often shared piece of advice on creativity that takes many forms, but generally translates as to " find connections between disparate ideas ". One common source of this advice are thinkers focused on technology innovation : <p> " Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they did n't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That 's because they were able to connect experiences they 've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they 've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. " -- Steve Jobs( Wired, 2004, http : **35;3741;TOOLONG...) <p> Examples of innovations that have resulted from connecting the seemingly unconnected include Kastelle 's example of the toaster draw from Jeff Bezos Ted Talk( combine the idea of electricity in the home with the idea of racks on stoves for toasting bread), Steve Job 's connecting the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the design of the Apple II, or the " neonatal incubator that 's built entirely out of automobile parts "( see the Johnson talk). <p> Synthesizing the disparate does n't just matter in technology innovation. The most universe denting ideas in history came from revolutionary thinkers bringing together seemingly impossibly dichotomies : Plato 's metaphysics and epistemology as a merger of the theories that there are many and there are one, the writer 's of the new testament who wove together the transcendence and immanence of God, or Plank, Bohr, Einstein et. al. who built quantum mechanics on the synthesis of wave and particle theories of energy, light and matter. <p> How do we do this practice effectively? Turning to the initially quoted technology innovation thinkers : Kastelle advises that we " experiment widely and see what works ", Steve Jobs ' said we need to experience more and think about those experiences more, and Steven Johnson talks about the need for creating environments that facilitate the change of ideas and give ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would add the importance of belief in the possibility of a fruitful synthesis. When you first ask what if questions like those posed above, it is not going to be obvious how ideas are going to blend or synergize. It may not even be obvious why the two ideas should be brought together in the first place. However, if you have a hunch that there might be value in the marriage of the disconnected, trust it against all odds. Let it percolate. Try articulating it in different formulations and hold true to your belief that eventually a formulation of value will emerge. The conviction that all dichotomies are collapsible and all conceptual dis/unconnections bridgeable, while often unreasonable, will produce
