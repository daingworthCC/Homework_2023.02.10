5202841 <h> It Was Right in Front of Me in Black and White <p> 17 Sep <p> As a national speaker I have presented to hundreds of family caregivers throughout the country. In each presentation I highlight how, as caregivers, we can become task masters ; focused on our to-do list more than the people around us. I share this with caregivers because I realized in looking back over the time I cared for my grandfather, that the pattern happened so seamlessly that it was n't until years later that I realized that I was so focused on what needed to be done, that I missed opportunities to just spend time with him as his granddaughter. <p> So you would think that after reflecting, recognizing and relating this information to family caregivers all across the country, I would be extremely self-aware if it were to happen again, right?! WRONG! <p> Last year I began journaling, many people think that as an author and blogger journaling would be something I do naturally, however ; it 's far from the truth. During a year that included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed some way to organize my thoughts and get inspired. I would journal the positive things happening, what I wanted to happen and create action plans based those ideas. Exciting opportunities were being created and it was all documented in my journal. <p> This summer I spotted my journal under a pile on my desk, not remembering the last time I had written in it and recalling the encouragement I decided to read through the entries. There were pages of inspired thoughts and thankfulness to God for all He was doing in my life and business. <p> However ; when I turned to the final entry I was shocked. <p> It read : <p> To Do <p> Pay phone bill <p> Write blogs <p> Follow up with contacts <p> Dog grooming <p> A stark contrast to the pages of enthused optimism filling the prior pages. <p> Noting the date I realized, it had happened again and, once again, I was n't even aware of it. But there it was in black and white... the entry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer. <p> Her diagnosis had filled a switch that propelled me into the role of caregiver task-master without even being conscious of it. <p> With my new-found awareness I was able to make the following adjustment : <p> I shared my revelation with my mom and scheduled time with my mom that was not related to dr. visits. <p> I take time daily to take care of myself and just breath, because it is vital to take care of myself in order to be available to those around me. <p> I began journaling again to re-connect with the inspiration I had found in the pages. <p> If you are caring for someone I encourage you today to do a self-check. Are you more focused on your to-do list then on the people around you? If the answer is " yes " make the necessary changes to take of yourself and connect with those you love. <h> Share this : <h> Like this : <h> About Sue Salach <p> Sue has worked in the geriatric healthcare field for close to 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a caregiving resource guide, and the novel " If I Walked in Her Shoes "( http : **27;3546;TOOLONG).
