5195141 <h> A perfect sunny Sunday in San Francisco... <p> Destination : the Fillmore district Requirements : $50 and an awesome friend <p> Brunch lunch at Woodhouse Fish Company on Fillmore. I recommended oysters and fish and chips, lobster roll or fish tacos. Wash it down with a cold, delicious Scrimshaw. <p> Head south to 1300 Fillmore for live jazz and bottomless pomosas. Sit at the bar and enjoy gospel brunch. <p> On your way to Alamo Square park stop by a local convenient store to pick up a snack and libations of your choice. Try Third World Market( Fillmore and Turk). <p> Finally, kick back in Alamo Square park and enjoy the fresh air. Use your phone as a music player, enjoy some tunes, watch the dogs running around, and people watch. Relax, meditate and appreciate the company of who you 're with. <h> One Response to A perfect sunny Sunday in San Francisco... <p> of course, here I go again, only puting my sight on food.But really, SF is made up of 99% delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " crowed.You MUST love food,
