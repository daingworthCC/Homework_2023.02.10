5187341 <h> Can ' Salivaomics ' Change the Face of Dentistry? <p> According to a press release from the UCLA School of Dentistry, dentists may now be considered the " renaissance men " of the medical world. Along with a collaboration of institutes, Dr. David Wong and his team of scientific researchers at UCLA conducted extensive research in the world of " salivaomics " which yielded results that could change the face of dentistry. <p> Salivaomics, the study of biological molecules in saliva, suggests that the molecules found within in it could potentially detect autoimmune diseases, diabetes and various types of cancer early on in individuals. Along with his team, Dr. Wong suggests that detection through a saliva sample is just as accurate as any sample of blood or bodily fluid but is less invasive and more convenient for the patient. <p> The science behind these findings reveals that the genes, proteins, DNA and RNA naturally found in human saliva are able to explain exactly what is going on in the body and not just the degree of their oral health. <p> By no means do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments with their family doctor. Dr Wong expects that future research in salivaomics will eventually translate into practical medical applications. <p> Salivaomics will change dentistry. When it becomes available, it will transform the dental office into a community 's leading center for health. Currently, salivary diagnostics are available through OralDNA, by which we can test for genetic tendencies and microbial burden, both very important parts of a modern dental office. <p> In addition to using salivary diagnostics in my own practice, I also educate dentists on how to successfully incorporate them into an oral inflammation reduction center in their dental practice.
