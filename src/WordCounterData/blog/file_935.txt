5202541 <h> Wednesday, November 7, 2012 <h> the face of the season <p> Do n't even try denying it anymore - you 're totally obsessed with the girl who seemed to be on every single runway during the spring/summer 2013 season. It 's everything about her - the fabulous runway walk, her cheekbones, her BROWS. Do n't even get me started on how much I envy those brows... She is everything right now, and here 's just a little rundown on who exactly this Cara Delevingne is : <p> Cara is 20 years of age - two weeks younger than myself - and she 's a British based model. Born in London, raised in a ' socialite ' family( her sister is Poppy Delevingne, you know, the really amazingly dressed f-rower + her grandfather is Sir Jocelyn Stevens, more info here). Cara has walked for pretty much every show that matters. She has also been the face of Burberry, alongside the totally cute Eddie Redmayne, and she still remains close friends with Christopher Bailey. Cara loves to dress in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more normal street clothes, it always gives off a vibe like ' you totally wan na be my best friend '. And finally, Cara has a sweet role in the( 2012) film ' Anna Karenina ', which also stars Keira Knightly. <p> Yes, Cara, I totally wan na be your best friend. But still I want your brows more. I also happen to post quite a bit of Cara images on my Facebook page, so you can join that, if you have n't already *coughcough* <p> Now, for some words of motivation for us working girls - half of the week is over. During the weekend we will have time to sit and watch Homeland, and paint our nails( two things I 'm personally DYING to do already). Tomorrow we can say tomorrow, hang in there! xx <p> I know, Cara is absolutely stunning! I 've been seeing photographs of her a lot but I had absolutely no idea who she was - she certainly caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name ;) Lovely post, those photographs you chose are absolutely stunning! There 's a new post up on my blog and I 'd love to hear your thoughts on it so feel free to stop by! <p> What I love about Cara is that she is n't just pretty, but she has this versatility that you can put her into tomboy clothes and the most glamourous and feminine nightgown. I prefer her over her sweeter sister Poppy, although she is lovely too( and I want that magnenta
