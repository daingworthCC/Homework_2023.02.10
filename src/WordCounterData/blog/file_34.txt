5111441 <p> Teo Bear comments on the deplorable failure of our officials and media to either vet or purge Obama. While the election is not all about a referendum on Obama 's eligibility, the number of voters so mobilized may make a critical difference. <p> November 5, 2012 <p> It is time to leave Obama bin Laden 's questionable claim to being a natural born citizen in the hands of America 's body politic. Long ago I knew it would end back here, a few weeks before the election, we would be telling you that Obama is not a constitutionally qualified natural born citizen under Article II, Section 1, clause 5. I knew this because the courts, the press and elected officials have been evading this issue for over 4 years now. However, this election we are prepared and have had the time to make this known to a majority of America. <p> I can say with absolute certainty that the definition of a natural born citizen last used by the Supreme Court of the United States demonstrates that Obama does not qualify under it, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached to change the national common law of the United States which is a natural born citizen is the child of citizens born under the protection of their parents citizenship. <p> After trying for over four years to get someone to look at the evidence and rule on Obama to no avail, what makes anyone think that another four years will produce better results. He was n't legal 4 years ago and he wo n't be legal 4 years from now yet we have a Congress and a SCOTUS and every Federal Judge in America that is willing to sell their soul to the devil and break their oath of office just to keep the usurper in power. Justice in America is dead and our Constitution is a worthless piece of paper until we install people in power
