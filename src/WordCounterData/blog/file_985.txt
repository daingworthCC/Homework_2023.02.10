5207541 <h> Rumor : Final Fantasy Versus XIII canceled <p> Square Enix has apparently canceled the development of Final Fantasy Versus XIII. <p> The game has been in development for over six years, but unnamed sources have suggested developer Square Enix has ceased development of the PlayStation 3 exclusive. A public statement on the game 's cancelation wo n't apparently be made, with the firm believing that could negatively impact stock price. <p> Resources stemming from the project have been transferred over to the next Final Fantasy title, Final Fantasy 15. <p> Announced during the May of 2006, the action RPG has been shielded from the spotlight for years, with only several rare glimpses emerging in the form of screenshots and trailers. <p> Pretty sure this is n't true. Square has made stupid decisions in the past, but I 'm pretty sure they are n't stupid enough to can a project they 've already invested a ton of money into. <p> We can leave that to Activision.... and Capcom. But if this were true... goddamn, the rage will be enough to ignite World @ @ @ @ @
