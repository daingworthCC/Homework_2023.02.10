5168341 <p> Survival, in combat situations as well as off the battlefield involves having the right gear, the knowledge to use it, but also the level of preparation you 've given your body. The most elemental level of self-preservation lies in your body 's capacity for survival. With balancing your diet and physical fitness, you can ensure your ability to respond quickly when you most need it. In previous articles, I 've discussed how staying hydrated and eating right can impact how efficient of a machine it can become, but operating smoothly is only half of physical fitness. The other half lies in body strength, which can only be developed through exercise. <p> In the lectures I 've attended as a biology student, and in the material I studied to tutor anatomy and physiology, I 've learned about the muscular system and how it functions, on the molecular and visible levels. As a runner, though, I 've been able to apply this knowledge in a practical fashion to improve my performance as an athlete. I 'll summarize some of the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it relates to overall physical fitness in this article. <p> Calories In = Calories Out <p> Balancing your diet is an important part to staying healthy, but it has little impact on the strength of the body, except to provide the energy it needs to function. To continue to improving your level of physical fitness, you must also regularly exercise. When you have to march any measure of distance all geared up, you notice every extra pound. A good rule of thumb to remember is this : if the daily intake of calories exceeds the output of calories burned in a day, that energy will accrue( generally as fat stores in adipose tissue). And, logically, if you burn more calories than you consume in a day, your level of accrued energy( like fat) decreases. In short, if calories in = calories out, your weight will stay the same. <p> Muscularity vs. Endurance <p> Maintaining your body weight can also be managed, to some degree, through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity( in this way, you lost the adipose with less risk of putting your body into dietary shock). Increasing your body strength, overall, will also make carrying gear feel less burdensome. Working out will benefit you in strengthening your muscles, such as your legs, back and arms, allowing you to carry more weight, but it also improves the strength of your heart and lungs. Working your cardiovascular system through endurance workouts offers more benefit to your body for staving off fatigue and in processing and storing nutrients in the long run. This means that overall fitness is bettered by balancing high-intensity muscle-building workouts with lower-intensity endurance-building workouts. That translates to being able to carry heavier gear faster for longer. <p> Strength : Bones, Muscles, and Joints <p> Improving your body strength is often considered in muscle development because it is the most visible element of physical strength, but becoming stronger has several components. While you increase your physical fitness, you improve your muscularity, increasing your muscle mass and tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Skeletal Strength <p> The human skeleton is remarkably adaptive. The skeleton responds to physical exertion by strengthening the bones( in physiology, this is called " Wolff 's law of bone). Over time, the bones will adjust to increased physical activity by strengthening, both in width and in material( the increase of certain minerals in the skeleton can make the bones stronger), and by restructuring the architecture of the spongy bone( porous bone matter at the end of long bones, like the femur) along the lines of mechanical stress. This improves the bones ' ability to withstand the extra force exerted upon them through heavy physical activity. <p> Muscle Strength <p> The muscles respond quicker to changes in the demand the body puts upon them than do the bones. Muscles increase in size and tone, their internal chemistry changes to become more receptive to the signals from the brain, and the brain reinforces signal pathways to become more efficient at communicating to the muscles. As the body works harder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull they place on the bones as part of body movement. The stronger the pull on the bone, the faster and stronger the movement becomes. <p> Joint Strength <p> The joints need more time to adapt to increased stress. With an increase in stress from the muscle system, the cells that build bone deposit more mineral mass, providing additional strength to the bones, especially on the places where the tendons connect. For athletes, this is especially important, because as they increase the difficulty of their workout, they must take into consideration that their body will be strong enough to handle the more strenuous activity before their bones and joints have time to " catch up. " Rushing the process, for example, dramatically increasing the speed or distance of a run, can cause severe injury to the joints, even if the muscles are capable of resisting fatigue from the workout. <p> Conclusion <p> Improving physical fitness is accomplished through managing the body 's level of nutrition and hydration, and developing body strength through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to manage body weight, but, more importantly, it also improves the strength of the muscles, the bones, the joints, and that of the heart and lungs. Increasing your physical fitness will help you to develop the strength to hold your rifle steadier and for longer periods of time. It also primes your muscles to explode with force as you sprint to your next cover. Good diet and regular exercise not only make your body a better tool for your survival, but it aids in improving your ability to use the rest of your kit. Is physical fitness a part of your loadout? <p> FateofDestinee I have never found anyone who was introduced to Kettlebells correctly that did n't benefit.. They are a great adjunct exercise or a stand alone system. They have been adapted by Secret Service as part of their physical training. i have a great photo someone sent me of a NAVY SEAL teaching how to shoot out of the bed of a pick up truck and right in the truck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With all due respect, this post was pretty poor. The basic premise behind it is accurate, but the content and explanation are lacking. This website is fantastic, but taking or teaching biology and basic anatomy/physiology does n't make one an expert in the realm of strength and conditioning. <p> 70sbig I write from my background as a student and a tutor with an interest in fitness. I do n't intend to be an encyclopedic or expert source of information( I do n't think I 'm qualified for that), but I do hope to discuss topics that are relevant to my pursuits as a runner and a biology major, and to promote sharing of opinions and information. I appreciate your feedback, even though my article was n't what you were looking for. Thanks for reading : <p> I like most of crossFit I am not a fan of the barbell snatch and some of the other risky moves.. I know a few guys who injured their shoulders doing snatches.. I think the power clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still an explosive movement.I know the CrossFit guys will light me up for this.But I would bet you will not find and NFL or NHL or NBA team doing barbell snatches during the season or at all due to the risk of injury.. I think the Ketlebell snatch is just as effective.In fact timed KB snatches are a BEAST.. <p> I discovered kettlebels a few years ago and they have become my basic go to workout.. In fact after getting to talk to a few SEALS at an Air Show i completely changed everything I do.. going to a circuit.. more of the crossfit type.. Even at 58 i can out work my calorie intake that way.. <p> PatrickM I 've heard some good things about integrating kettlebells into workout routines, but I have n't tried them. I end up doing more isometrics with little dumbbells... and my brother runs me through some Army PT drills to help me mix it up. <p> Love the words! I found a great outlet for training are triathlons, because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle groups.. Try
