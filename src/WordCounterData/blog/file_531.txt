5161541 <p> Welcome fellow weasel watchers. This week 's contest saw another first with a six way tie for second place on the Council side. That is a testament to just how strong each entry was. <p> Beating out all other council members was a very strong Glittering eye article in a follow up to a previous post about taxation via Keynesian economic theory and how that theory falls flat especially in today 's economic climate. <p> During the fiscal year that 's just beginning, fiscal year 2010, the federal government plans to spend $3.8 trillion dollars, the largest annual expenditure ever. On the revenue side, taxes will bring in about $2.3 trillion, so the federal government is creating a shortfall of approximately $1.5 trillion. That projected deficit will vary as the months pass, but it may well end up being even higher than the record-setting deficit in 2009 of $1.4 trillion. Those huge amounts translate into a federal government that will spend $33,000 on each household but that will raise only $19,000. <p> Although President Obama and the Congress do plan to raise taxes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new spending plans, leaving the budget with historically huge deficits throughout the next decade. Those deficits will be financed by selling U.S. Treasury bonds to people all over the world and paying them back with interest in years to come. But instead of borrowing, could a congress willing to bring taxpayers the full bill for this year 's spending erase the deficit by raising taxes this year? <p> On the non-council side we have an excellent article that appeared in Black &; Right that exposes many on the lunatic left for their own ignorance and racist attitudes and how the two have combined to attack anyone that dare defend Rush Limbaugh against the left wing lynch mob.( Note, there was a tie in the non-council side for first place and I broke that tie with a vote for Comment of the Day) <p> Of course, it is always good when an " Uncle Tom " Negro writes a defense to one of the most reprehensible men in recent times. The vile and borderline vulgar language that comes from Rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting -- however, I challenge the writer of this to ACTUALLY LISTEN to him sometime. More recently, Rush attacked the President about a college thesis that the President NEVER WROTE!!!!! He reacted on false information -- much like what this so-called writer has written about in his article. -- Alvin <p> I love it when those on the tolerant and inclusive left use the very racist language they always accuse others of thinking, and come right out with it verbally to blacks, especially when they display their own ignorance in the process. <p> Let 's break Alvin 's comment down. <p> Of course, it is always good when an " Uncle Tom " Negro writes a defense to one of the most reprehensible men in recent times. <p> For many who visit B &R; on a regular basis, this will be review. <p> Obviously Alvin has never read the Harriet Stowe novel, nor have the many others who wrongly use " Uncle Tom " as a pejorative. <p> According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An old slave and the protagonist of the novel, Tom 's two most prevalent qualities are his inherent goodness and piety. He is a passive Christ-figure who consistently forgives the wrongs committed against him and turns to God in times of crisis. From learning to read the Bible and write letters to his kin, Tom is consistently trying to improve himself despite the limits placed upon him by slavery. Tom also serves as a Christian leader for the other slaves in the novel. " <p> While I would never claim to be all that noble, I am one of many trying to wake up black people. As I 've written many times, despite the fact that most blacks have voted the straight Democrat ticket for decades, the conditions in the black community have only deteriorated, and in one of the most ignorant displays of political knowledge possible, they blame Republicans. <p> Please read and pass along all winning entries as you eagerly look forward to next week 's contest which will be up on Wednesday. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few new council members to fill out some vacant spots. if you have a blog and believe your material is a good match for the council please check out or rules and submit your best posts! -- The Watcher <p> As a proud member of the Watcher of Weasels Council, I am always looking for new, interesting, well-written articles and blogs. We pride ourselves in shining a light on the weasels around the world and promoting a variety of other...... <p>... Last week, I think we had something of a first at the Watcher 's Council : a six-way tie for second place. Wow! What this means is that we all submitted such uniformly good posts we were unable to decide anything but that the winner, The Glittering Eye, did a fantastic job. Anyway, here 's the whole list. Also, please keep in mind that the Watcher 's Council is looking for a couple of new members. Those of you who have your own blog and would like to be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules and apply. Also, even if you do n't want to belong, please take note that we 'll be reinstituting the old practice of " link whorage, " which allowed people to submit ' honorable mention ' entries
