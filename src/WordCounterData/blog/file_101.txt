5118141 <h> Change Before You Have To <h> " Change before you have to. " -- Jack Welch <h> I have been thinking a lot about " change " <p> So, why is it that we resist it? Why do we resist change, dread it, fear it? Is it in our genetic makeup, as humans, that change is something to fight? That life as we know it will be forever altered if we follow down the path of change? <h> My Struggle <p> I have a hard time understanding why we fail to see change as a way to improve who we are, to better a process, to increase the benefit to those who follow us or are a part of our network, our personal circle of influence. <h> Stagnation Destroys <p> Who we are now is very different from who we were a short year ago. And even more different from who we will be one year hence. Why do we deny it? Change is inevitable but it is also good. Stagnation destroys. If the algae does n't get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see is worse than being blind. At least in blindness, we seek alternative ways to decipher what is happening around us. In refusal, we shut down, we close off. <p> Embrace the change. Embrace the new path, an alternate direction. <p> Failing to do so will result in what? You tell me. It 's not a difficult situation to dissect. You 're smart, you tell me. <p> " Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks about changing himself.
