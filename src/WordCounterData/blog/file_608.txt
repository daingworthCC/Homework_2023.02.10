5169241 <h> Jewish man mixed in with a group of republicans said he supported Nati. Health Care? <p> A woman yelled Heil Hitler. The Jewish man flipped out and she just stood there stunned. Then she fired back that he should be more against Obama than anyone. He replied, in broken English, " I sat in a waiting room for 2 hours, 2 hours!!! and they tried to charge me $8,000.00. " Now, surely this man, in all his haste, left out something that was more of the reason for the 8,000.00 cost. However, the woman 's reaction was that of mocking a two year old with boohoos. She literally boohooed to his face, whining and acting a fool... this lady was over 50 y/o, she looked. <p> What kind of intelligent level are these people comparing Obama to Hitler? How many has Obama killed, as compared to Bush? Death panels are false, and everyone knows that, or they are minus a cognitive hosting station. Barney Frank had a similar incident, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that lady was being hushed by other fanatic(al) right wingers.( is it just fanatical, or does right winger still go in to the description? I think Websters is revising the definition of fanatic to make it more efficient : Fanatic : a republican disrupting a town meeting with nonsense, falsehoods, lies, hatred, and lack of total understanding of anything other than property under their own home, within their own country ; see " ethnocentric ") <p> again, who has Obama killed, wanted to kill? Do you know that 1% of the population, of America, gained 2/3 of the economic growth from 2002-2007 <p> Did you know that when Hitler rose to power he did not do it by starting out killing jews? I know its crazy, in fact he started out talking about the greater good of society. The reason we compare Obama to Hitler is their meteoric and rhetoric filled rise to power. And for their grab for more at every turn. We compare based on how they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working knowledge of history, not just the part about hitler killing Jews. We even understand that he did not just kill jews, but also blacks, Muslims, the handicapped, gypsies and pretty much anyone that did not fit into his master race. I know crazy huh. History is fun. When you learn it, you tend not to repeat it. <p> All opponents of the " plan " are Republicans? You seem pretty solid on that point. There are some neutrals who wonder how the government can assume another health care plan after placing Medicare into undeclared bankruptcy since it began issuing dollars to docs in 1967 after the 1965 bill was passed. The issue seems more monetary than ethnic. <p> A patient of mine kicked a table by accident and broke his small toe -- he went to the emergency room for an x-ray, which they did, and taped his toe. They sent him a bill for $4,000(!!!) His father paid the bill, which was too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the same x-ray for $25.00, and told him his toe was broken
