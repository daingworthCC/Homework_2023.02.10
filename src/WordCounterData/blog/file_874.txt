5196341 <h> Sunday, September 30, 2012 <p> One of the next big things I have to do with the kitchen redo is run the code correct venting for our fabulous new hood. <p> I 've run into a bit of a hitch( when do n't I). I have to install the exterior vent motor to the outside of the house. <p> My plan is to take out the ' window to no where ' and install the exterior vent motor in its place.... Problem is, its 13 ' up off the ground... Well, that 's not really the problem, the problem is, is that I only have 46.5 " of clearance between the fence and the house at this point. <h> 3 comments : <p> I am a professional residential builder/remodeler...... and I am impressed by your willingness to tackle tasks that are outside your comfort zone. Remember always... " A man 's reach should exceed his grasp ". <p> With that being said, your ladder issue is n't as dire as it seems. With 46.5 " of width you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the building. If possible, remove the ladder stabilizer altogether, as it 's only making the angle steeper. I am assuming you do n't have any ladder jacks or another extension ladder, else it would be best to place both ladders against the building and hang the ladder jacks on the inside with a walk plank spanning them. Good luck.... and do n't die! <p> Thanks for that, dust to dreams, I borrowed two levels of baker scaffolding and have it set up and firmly attached to the house in four places. Its not coming down.. Unfortunately, there are no safety rails so
