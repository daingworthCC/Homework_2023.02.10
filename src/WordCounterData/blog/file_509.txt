5159341 <p> " We have not ruled out that Fatah and the Palestinian Authority could have contributed in one way or another in the war against Gaza for political reasons such as bringing down the Hamas movement and regaining control. " <p> According to a June 2007 dispatch, Shin Bet head Yuval Diskin said " demoralized " Fatah officials wanted help to destroy Hamas. <p> " They are approaching a zero-sum situation, " said Diskin, " and yet they ask us to attack Hamas. They are desperate. This is a new development. We have never seen this before. " <p> He added that " Fatah is in a very bad shape in Gaza. We have received requests to train their forces in Egypt and Yemen. We would like them to get the training they need, and to be more powerful, but they do not have anyone to lead them. " <p> He also praised Shin Bet 's " very good working relationship " with Abbas at the time. His internal security service collaborates with Israel. He understands that " Israel 's security is central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... " <p> At the time, Fatah collaborated with Washington to oust Hamas. An abortive coup failed. More information surfaced. <p> WikiLeaks published a June 12, 2007 cable. It said Israeli military intelligence head Amos Yadlin told US embassy officials that Hamas retaining power in Gaza was advantageous. <p> " Although not necessarily representing a GOI( government of Israel) consensus view, " said Yadlin, " Israel would be ' happy ' if Hamas took over Gaza because the IDF could then deal with Hamas as a hostile state. " <p> Israel 's imperial agenda needs manufactured enemies. Having them facilitates violence and instability. They also help justify small and larger-scale wars. <p> Like Pillar of Cloud, Cast Lead was planned months in advance. Its aim was to advance Israel 's imperium. <p> It involves controlling all valued parts of Judea and Samaria, depopulating much of Palestine, and confining remaining population elements to canonized worthless scrubland. <p> Both conflicts are more about weakening Hamas than destroying it. They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, infants and the elderly. <p> Doing so is official Israeli policy in all conflicts. Israel considers all Palestinians combatants or potential future ones. <p> Perhaps Abbas and other Fatah officials knew about Pillar of Cloud in advance. Maybe they approved or urged it. <p> He did nothing to help beleaguered Gazans. Nor during Cast Lead. Both times he went along with Israeli slaughter and mass destruction. <p> Issam Younis serves as Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights general director. On November 20, Maan News published his " Letter to Abbas : Visit us in Gaza. " In part it said : <p> " This is a historic moment, that must be taken up. We 've waited for you in Gaza for six days. We 're still waiting ; your people who are being attacked and slaughtered in Gaza. " <p> " It is not acceptable anymore - no matter what those surrounding you make it look like to you - that you do not come. I do not invite you to show solidarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> " The advocates of divide can stay back in Ramallah. This scandalous schism must end now and here ; the schism that made your people bleed. " <p> " We are waiting to know that you have ordered PLO diplomats in Geneva, New York, Vienna, and Paris, and in all UN offices, to immediately act to convene the UN General Assembly, Human Rights Council, UNESCO and others to condemn the crimes perpetrated against our people in Gaza, and do all they can to secure that these crimes be investigated and punished. " <p> " It is regrettable we have not so far seen any meaningful diplomatic effort that matches the size of blood and suffering in Gaza. " <p> " We are waiting for the orders to our veteran diplomats to be set on fire and approach the European Union and other powers to mobilize the much-needed pressure on the occupying state. " <p> On November 4, Younis also challenged Hamas. Maan News published his open letter, saying : <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern, and I absolutely reject the double standards employed by the international community towards the movement. " <p> " The financial and political sanctions on Gaza are simply unjust and scandalous. Hamas won a free and fair election in 2006. The world was well aware that Hamas would win in the elections. " <p> " At the same time, he challenged Hamas to act more like a government than a ' movement. ' " <p> " The issue here is not about calling into question the intentions or desires of the people in power. It is more about the actual process of governance in such a unique situation like Gaza. " <p> " What is needed is for the government to interact openly with society, with all of its social and political structures. Society also has a duty to reciprocate and to be open to interacting with the government. " <p> She discussed both Younis letters. Abbas was abroad when Israeli terror bombing began. He returned. He had to. Yet he waited two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable and duplicitous. He showed which side he 's on. <p> He also convened Palestinian PLO leaders. "( H) e did n't even invite the Hamas representative in the West Bank. " He failed to show solidarity with Gaza. <p> " It is not clear whether the Hamas government would( let him come) as part of an overall conciliation agreement " or for any purpose. <p> During Cast Lead, his security forces prevented Palestinian protests. This time he did n't " dare( stop) people from marching toward Israeli Defense Forces checkpoints in the West Bank( to) demonstrate against the attacks on Gaza. " <p> Doing so fell far short of what 's needed. Palestinians need leaders serving them, not Israel. Abbas is a collaborative traitor. He 's also a pathetic spent force. <p> Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago and can be reached at **28;4261;TOOLONG. <p> Visit his blog site at sjlendman.blogspot.com and listen to cutting-edge discussions with distinguished guests on the Progressive Radio News Hour on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays and Sundays
