5114141 <p> On buying a plane : " No way. It 's a total waste of money. You buy the plane, then you have to pay for storage, and on top of that you have to think about the fuel, the cost of the fuel -- that 's maybe $4,000. Even hiring a private plane is like 50 or 60K. Once you get into that it becomes a habit -- a bad habit. I 'll get one when I need it -- if I have to go somewhere instantly -- but you do n't want to buy a plane ; it 's definitely not worth it. " <p> On music : " I never stop working. In what I wanted to do in music I 've never had any fear. But now I 'm at the top there 's nowhere to go but down ; for me it 's about staying standing at the top. I 'm not a kid any more -- I 'm an adult, I 'm making the decisions and I want to keep on growing, and I believe I can. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timberlake and Usher and see how they crossed over really successfully, and I 've seen people go off at the deep end, get full of themselves, think they 're the best and end up not being anything. I 've worked way too hard for that. I definitely do n't want to be just another teen heart-throb. But there are different ways of growing. I want to be loved like Michael Jackson was, from the four-year-olds to the 80-year-olds. I am going to change and grow through my music and doing films. This album was different. My next album will be even edgier. " <p> On swear words : " My music is never going to have swear words in it. Never. " <p> On music vs. school : " What happened was I found something I wanted to be good at. I was n't good at school because I had no passion for it. If I had n't found music my life would have been bad. My family are all poor, so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been poor, and their kids would have been too. I feel I broke the cycle, and when you get to break the cycle, you do n't go back. " <p> On the misconception : " That 's the greatest misconception of me. People think I 'm a product, that they found this good-looking kid, cut his hair nice and put Auto-Tune on his voice, wrote him good songs, taught him how to dance and then said, " Here is a pop star for you. " I am the furthest thing from that. I 'm a musician ; I play instruments, I write songs. I 'm a businessman ; I want to create an empire. I want people to know I do n't just sing songs. I 'm the guy who signed the girl who just had the biggest single all round the world( Carly Rae Jepsen with Call Me Maybe ; he brought her to the attention of Braun, who gave him a 50 per cent cut when he signed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am not threatened by anybody ; no one can threaten me. It 's actually cool to have other young people on the scene. I 've spent years being the only one at all these awards shows -- now there are other people my age. I hang out with One Direction, and the guys from The Wanted are fun, really funny guys. I keep my distance when they go to clubs to have their fun -- I go home. Drinking is definitely one way, but it 's not for me. I still want people to think I 'm a good person, a good influence. I want to be around tomorrow. " <p> On the fans : " I love my fans ; I love the mass hysteria. I mean, this was always what I wanted. And you 've got to remember I was this kid with no marketing campaign ; it was my fans that got me here. They were the ones who 'd show up at radio stations when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my record deal. That 's how everybody started saying, " Who is this kid, Justin Bieber, who has 10,000 girls outside a mall in New Jersey? " <p> On flying : " I just started to really not like getting on a flight. It scares me. When I get anxiety, my heart drops and starts beating really fast as if it 's going to explode. And when there 's a weird noise, it 's like, what 's that weird noise? People say you have more chance of getting into a car accident than a plane crash, but they do maybe one flight a year and I 'm on planes all the time. And all the time I 'm thinking I have no control. If this plane crashes I 'm dead. I feel like every time I get on a plane I 'm risking my life. " <p> WHY IS THERE A DIRECTIONER BARGING IN ALL THE TIME NOW?!?!?!??! I 'm usually not very angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idiot and you 're a directioner, instead of hating on him, why do n't you go on a One Direction fansite and leave beliebers alone? I welcome directioners if they 're not being rude but you are. What, are you mad because Justin took back the record of Most Watched Video in 24 Hours that One Direction took? <p> Justin is amazing guy who adores his family and friends. but cherish what he has with his fans and hopes to grow more fans as he grow older and wiser. he s still wise but having that mentaility of becoming adult dealing with people who are very ignorant in the business. of course the STALKRAZZI. THEY ARE LIKE BEES TO HONEY. <p> Among the things that attracted me to him recently as a fan is his confidence and strong character-he 's no pushover! Furthermore he has an exciting stage presence I do n't see in most most pop stars or boy bands today. He also will hopefully not be influenced to take drugs and ruin his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a little brother that I will always defend from the haters. <p> u know Justin that 's the kind of spirit your fans like n wanted n I trust that u will be like MJ not only by music but by your character n personality n I believe that you will not stop until the end just like MJ. <p> Ok correction, he did say his music. But I 'm not sure, they let her say the word on the radio, when they usually leave it out. Maybe it 's not what we think it is? I do nt know. Even so, I have the confidence that he wo n't curse.( That " damn " in Die in Your Arms does n't count to me. To me, because of it 's meaning, " damn " is n't really a curse word, so...) <p> Justin is my everything!! I devote my life to him he 's the only reason get out of bed in the morning he 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's my life. I do n't know what i 'd be doing without him and his music. So justin if you ever read this just know that your my life saver right now and if you stop making music I 'm gunnar cry!!!! <p> wonder how many beliebers justin will have is he was'nt so cute and sexy if he was ugly, but still the sweet boy he 's now, well i ' ll still would love him with all my hear becuz beauty is on the inside not on the outside, most people look at the outside of a pakkage not on whats in it lovely? <p> Amazing. This is why I love Justin. When Rihanna went stupid and started pushing out garbage instead of music, I did n't know what to do. Rihanna was my favorite. When I stopped listening to her, I thought that I would never have another favorite again. Then along came Justin. When I watched his interviews, I thought, " He sounds sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened, and I found a replacement for Rihanna. And his name was JUSTIN BIEBER! This interview just strethened my love for him again. The fact that he said that he would never curse in his music reminded me of why I liked him in the first place. When he said that he did n't need to drink to have his fun, that just made me think of how he wants to be a good example. He 's such a beautiful person, inside and out, and I do n't know why people hate him. This whole intrview just kept my love strong. ALWAYS A FAN! <p> Hi Justin. well when i finished read it up I just start crying cause i many times founding the human like you i mean you are real human and my dream comes true, i found you. thank you Justin for everything, you know maybe you think I 'm lying but I 'm really so happy that u are here with me, no matter where in USA or Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not change that. you give on my face smile when I 'm sad, every day, you are one in a million... Do you remember, you said that i/belieber in future I will marry, will have a husband and a children and i will forget about you. No you 're wrong, i will never forget about you, my half of heart will always belong just to You =) Thank You.. I Love You answer me please, of
