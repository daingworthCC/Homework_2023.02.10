5113241 <h> I did n't know that it was Ramadan... -- looking back traveling in Cairo - <p> From Delhi, transit in Kuwait, I arrived in Cairo, Egypt. I met one Japanese and followed to get to the Japanese hotel " Venice Hosokawake ". I stayed in Cairo for 2 weeks. <p> I saw some mummies and Tutankhamun in Egyptian Museum, impressed for the ancient technology at the 3 great pyramids of Giza, felt myself so small compared to the Earth at camping in White Desert. I also joined 2 CouchSurfing events. <p> I did n't know that it was a " Ramadan " month. So Islamic people were not able to eat or drink anything until sunset. Most sightseeing spots were closed at 3p.m. and also some restaurants were n't open at noon. It was kind of incovenient but Egyptian people were so energetic after sunset. <p> When I was walking in the street, one Egyptian took my hand and shouted for no reason, and some more like this... it was a bit annoying but I think I enjoyed it somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hosokawake ". Sometimes people start talking saying " where are you come from? " before introducing themselves. Right now, I am meeting so many Japanese people in Dahab also. The CouchSurfing events that I joined in Cairo was so fun, and I wanted to join more in the future. <p> I did n't go to Aswan, Luxor, or Abu Simbel which is south of Egypt. So next time
