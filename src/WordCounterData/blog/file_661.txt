5174541 <h> It Was the Best of Times, It Was the Pulpiest of Times. <p> I 've had a torrid love affair with berry picking all of my life. Like any good story of a torrid nature, it starts in my early childhood. <p> My parents still tell stories dating back to my early 90 's childhood concerning my love for berries. Once my mother demonstrated that these colorful objects could be picked from something leafy and green and placed right in one 's mouth, I was completely engaged -- which is saying a lot for a child of single digit years. On family camping trips I would ravenously consume blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strange bitter purple berries, awful red berries, gritty grey berries... and the list goes on.

As simple as it may seem, blueberry picking with members of the KNOM staff and fellow volunteers has been the most Alaskan experience I 've had in my short tenure here. Everything about the hour and a half spent kneeled down amongst the miniature sized jungle that is tundra vegetation was immensely zen and soul-easing. The rolling hills, the sound of wind making its way across the tundra, and the occasional call of a raven or seagull paired with the company of new friends made for a wonderful time.
