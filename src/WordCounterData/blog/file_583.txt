5166741 <p> Arrow producer Marc Guggenheim talks more about what we should and should n't expect from the upcoming CW show, and reveals whether the team working on the series will be allowed to use the Caped Crusader( something Smallville never did during its decade long run). <p> We already know that well-know Green Arrow villains, ' China White ' and ' Deadshot ' will apear in the upcoming CW series, but in an interview with IGN TV, Arrow producer Marc Guggenheim was asked if fans should expect to see some familiar heroic faces turn up as well. Unfortunately, his answer is( unsurprisingly) a fairly vague one. <p> " I would say, ' Probably. ' One of the things we want to do is roll the show out at the right pace. For the most part, I think we 've taken the philosophy that things are happening sooner rather than later. I always feel like every time we get the note from the network, ' Is this happening too soon?, ' I feel like we 're on the right track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient. I want to see stuff. We 're not going to make the audience wait to see characters, plot twists, revelations. I think running out of great characters and great moments is a quality problem to have, and I just want to have them. " <p> As for whether Batman will be one of the allies that this iteration of Oliver Queen meets up with, Guggenheim remains optimistic that the team behind Arrow will be able to use him in the series. For years, fans hoped that they might see Bruce Wayne appear in Smallville, but the show was never allowed by Warner Bros. execs to use him. Could that now change following the release of Christopher Nolan 's final film in The Dark Knight trilogy? <p> " Oh, my hope is that we can use him at some point. I think that plagued the Smallville showrunners more than it plagues us because, obviously, the Dark Knight Trilogy is over. They 're not available to us yet. My hope is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be awesome. No question, that would be absolutely awesome. But I do n't know commit plagiarism, piracy, trademark or copyright infringement. For the " thumbs up " to the left! Popular articles will appear on the homepage automatically! <p> It would make a lot of sense, considering they said no " super " heroes. Batman would fit perfectly in this world. Especially since they are going for Nolan 's " dark, gritty, realistic " style. I 'm not a fan of that per-say myself. <p> My hope is no. Seriously this is a green arrow show. Do n't let any of the trinity member show up to steal the thunder. That would be literally stupid. The green arrow should be able to find his own place and stand still on his own. <p> a Batman/Bruce Wayne would be great in this series. Both do not have " super powers " and must rely on skill and cunning. An onler Batman might drop in and offer advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> I hope they let Batman in this series, although I think they should wait till after the first season is over. It 'd be cool if they had Bruce Wayne/Batman as a recurring character for a few seasons and then spin the character off to his own show. As I understand it, The CW is not doing well financially, if Arrow turns out to be a success a Batman spin off might make the network profitable again. <p> If this show gets really popular and maybe in season 3 he could be special guest star, then in the next season they could upgrade him to series regular like they did with GA in Smallepenis er uh um i mean smalleville. <p> F it, why not? I 'll be watching this. I hate when ppl complain about CB movies or tv shows, I.e. Smallville. You clowns should be happy that actors want to be superheroes and that CB movies are being pumped out 3+ a year. I remember all these movies were suppossed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's respect that CB movies and tv shows are being made cuz Smallville with its flaws was still benter than 90% of the crap on tv today. <p> Smallville was a story of a teenage Clark Kent and it was great Seasons 1-3, 4 sucked, 5 was ok, 6-7 were good and great at times, 8 was ok, 9-10 had some great stuff like Absolute Justice but too many lackluster episodes and too much cheesy crap. <p> But for people to dismiss the entire series as bad is just foolish. I have to wonder what they think shouldve been better? It had a great cast. Great guest stars. and it give a new life to Superman and some depth never seen even in the comics. It was better by far than Any of the Superman films, even Superman The Movie. Until Smallville Clark Kent was a void, an undeveloped character who existed because Superman felt a need to look like a fool or something. <p> I think guys diss Smallville for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because girls went crazy for them. <p> The problem that Smallville had was that it tried to do things that it just did n't have the budget for--like in season eight 's " showdown " with Doomsday, it was completely laughable and Doomsday looked ridiculous. Taking that into consideration, I would amend what I said earlier and say that they should only have Batman in it if they have the means to do the character justice by not just have a good story but also the financial tools to fully realize it. <p> It made sense that Batman did n't appear in Smallville because that was Clark 's coming of age and ends when he becomes Superman. Clark and Bruce would n't have met and really were n't associated until both were in their careers( recall references to " the flying man in Metropolis " in post-Crisis Batman Year One continuity when both were just getting their hero careers started in their respective cities). Arrow seems to be past the whole coming of age phase. <p> @darkmetal.... I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake. It did have its moments. However, Clark Kent was n't an undeveloped character until Smallville showed up to save him. For all of its flaws, " Lois &; Clark, The New Adventures of Superman " finally gave Clark Kent the props he deserved. Dean Cain did an outstanding job of portraying CK as a relatable, normal guy that had amazing powers. That was the show that defined Clark Kent as the true identity and Superman was the disguise. <p> It 'll be interesting to see what happens with this series if and when a Justice League movie comes out. <p> Green Arrow is the 8th member of the Justice League, so if a JL movie franchise takes off, they 'd definitely have to at least think about including him at some point. One of the reasons Batman was never in Smallville was to avoid any confusion : to avoid having two live action versions of the character on the go. Bearing in mind the rumours about Marvel wanting to do a live action show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WB and DC wanting to try and do the same thing here. <p> It would n't surprise me if the JL movies and Arrow ended up happening in the same universe, even if the characters themselves do n't directly cross over. <p> I agree. Batman/Bruce Wayne should show up later after the show hits its stride. It would be cool to see Bruce Wayne show up at Queen Industries( Whatever it 's called) and eventually Batman could show up after deducing Arrow 's secret identity. I would go Bat-S**t crazy!!! <p> They need to have Bruce Wayne in the first season. Not only have Bruce Wayne but choose a great actor for him and include Grayson &; even Tim Drake as his Step Son &; ward. It would be insanely smart to go that route. Just 1 episode or 2. Let them do something awesome at some point. Bring back Grayson in the second season for another Cameo, maybe even as Nightwing. Third Season, toss in Batman! <p> The bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be that once they see what the ratings for the show will be after the first appearance of the character, he will be a regular on the show( if not take it over).
