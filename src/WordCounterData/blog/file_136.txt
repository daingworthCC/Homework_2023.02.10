5121641 <h> Poll : Additional Stretch Goals <p> As we enter the last two weeks of the pledge campaign, we 're continuing to look at ways to make sure Squadron 42 and Star Citizen are the game you want to play. To that end, we 're preparing to roll out a more comprehensive set of stretch goals... and, as usual, we would like the community 's input. What do YOU think we could plan to add to our campaign? <p> One big topic we 've seen discussed is support for additional platforms : OSX, LInux and the like. Because of how CryENGINE 3 works we do n't yet know if this will be possible... but we 'd like to know how strong an interest there is! If this is a deciding factor for you, select that option in the poll to let us know which platform you 'd like to see supported below. <p> Localization seems to be another big request. We plan to launch the game in English, French, Spanish and German and support further options as time goes on... but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages? If so, which languages do you think should be added first? <p> Other options include more ' rewards ' for players( ships, upgrades, credits, etc.), more gameplay modes and a bigger game world. An enhanced FPS mode would give you more options for the boarding actions( more weapons, customizable armor, deeper mechanics.) A tactical mode could allow capital ship crews to oversee fighters engaged in battle. Obviously those all sound great... but which is the most important? <p> Finally, possibly the most important option on this poll is " other " : please, tell us YOUR idea for possible stretch goals! <p> Please select your top three options! <p> Which additional stretch goals would you most like to see added to the campaign? <h> Share this : <h> Leave a Reply <p> 1 : More RPG Elements, I 'd like to see my commander be able to be a specialist and be rewarded for his training towards a specific goal, and be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most, so if I 'm a trader I earn skill points in a trading tree, if I 'm always out mixing it up in dog fights then some XP towards flight skills etc. Things like item research so that we can upgrade our ship modules, and perhaps sell the rights to those learnt upgrades to other players. <p> 2 : More Systems, and more detail inside those systems, so that we can explore, mine, trade, exploit etc etc. <p> 3 : Trash the cards and send out T shirts instead -- or perhaps as an option. <p> No need to limit the world to a Space Sim. The important thing is having the option to choose what you want. IF you want to be a fighter, go to SQ42, a smugler or something like that, SC is available. So, there 's room to make things liek they do in a RPG, or a RTS, if you do n't want, do n't do it, but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Star Citizen universe. <p> Picked more star systems, more ships and other. More star systems would mean more stuff to explore in the online version. About 30 missions for Squadron 42 seems about right, but the online world is never too big. <p> More ships would be nice. I know it 's more complicated than just making a new rendering for a ship hull. So the amount of work required to build another ship class must be similar to building a city in your typical MMO. So I 'd rather go with quality over quantity. But even so, more ships would be fun. And " other ", I thought about that advanced peripheral support. I 'm definitely getting Oculus Rift and Leap Motion, so I want those supported. <p> The other choices I do n't really care for. Localizations.. well even if the game was translated to my native language, I would play it in english. All the FPS/tactical stuff would distract players and devs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I signed up for, not a deathmatch shooter game or RTS. <p> Tools to facilitate the translation could be provided, but association with fans to provide the translations for the release( and maybe achieving some more pledges due that) I think would be best. Even why there 's no reason to spend so much money with translation companies when we have so many people that could do the job, even for free sometimes, just to have their names in the game credits. People that believes that is necessary to use official companies to make translations are the same that think that is necessary a publisher for games. <p> @-@ I do nt know how things like in else where. But in China, Most of translation patch are made by player themselves. Even some " Official " translation was not as good as them. On my personal opinion. We can save some money to do some thing more attractive than give a official translation <p> Let 's say : Stretch goal = Chinese, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that 's would be the best for this scenario, and not doing later after the game release, because people knowing now that the game will be in fact translated and delivered in their language, probably they will be more interested in doing pledges and participating of the community and helping to spread the news and bringing even more people to participate and pledge. <p> Ship classes, definitely #1. Particularly huge behemoths with winding corridors and cabin windows, A ship you can explore and call home. I know the development cost of bigger ships is high, and ships in general are a design resource hog, but it adds so much to the game. Consider Escape Velocity : Nova, tons of ships, tons of weapons, tons of systems. They were all sprites, so they were also cheap to develop, but that richness did n't keep my friends and I from talking about load-outs and hulls. Also, escorts helped gameplay a lot! <p> Mine : Fed Carrier with all of its slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Another carrier in formation to provide fighter support, a manticore for disabling, a missile boat( usually a pirate enterprise), and a pair of pirate starbridge Ds for harrowing and chase. Rich, complex, memorable. <p> Mac Support is what I 'm looking for. Would be awesome to get this game to run natively on Mac rather than have to run boot camp to play the game. <p> More missions is a good one too. I always love when a game can tell a good story, I 've never played any of the Wing Commanders but I 've heard good things and I 'm interested in seeing what the story will be. <p> I chose advanced FPS mode, tactical command mode, and more squadron 42 missions. As someone running OSX, it would be convenient to play the game in OSX, but it 's not that big of a deal to me, I can just dual boot into Windows to play the game. <p> I was seeing different ones, searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seeing different bolded options. However, I was apparently not logged in, clicking reply prompted me to log in and now I am seeing my correct choices bolded. <p> Interesting, maybe something procedurally generated rather than random so that everyone has the same infinite experience? I could get behind that, although the fiction for the involved planets would have to be simplified. <p> My other would be for a way for players to be able to submit ideas or plans for customised or customisable ships/weapons/equipment for upgrades. Its great the SC team have outlined some basic equipment and I 'm sure there will be more, but what about something completely different and non mainstream that I want to fit to one of my ships slots that 's not available in the standard upgrade/equipment list. <p> Hopefully we can see all that culture and science in game. being able to pull up a planets info and see all the facts and stories about their culture and history. Or selecting ships and seeing detailed readouts on who made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other. For Other I would ask for more depth to the universe where possible. Random NPC Radio chat, ships talking too each other about random topics( Pirates, cargo prices, government actions, etc) Ingame radio that details random news stories and music( like the later fallout titles) News feeds at planets and stations with more random local news like a fire on a cruise ship in system or a controversial political decision, just more " background noise " to the universe to bring it to life. Ambient action on planets and stations, not dependent on players just happening between NPCs( Pick pockets, Haggling, security patrols and people being thrown out of clubs) More fluff stuff to do, Pointless little things that do n't necessarily give you an advantage but make the universe more " real "( Buying a greasy wrap/kebab for 1-2 credits at a vendor near the docks, having a eating animation for it while you walk, changing music on the jukebox at a club/bar, a dance floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to players or NPCs) <p> I would like to see the ability to do not eject simply, but running to a Scape Pod( in major ships that you could have). And, scape pods customized, with guns maybe. Even some ships in a format like motorcycles would be fun to get out of the system or something like that, after your main ship exploded. <p> I agree. In the future we could have a lot more than a simple Space Sim. There 's a lot of room for inovation and we do not need to be following rules only to have the game categorized as a Space Sim. As Origin said : " We create worlds " -- and there is no only Space Sim in the world People sometimes exagerated in their allegiances to a specific game genre. But you always can do the things in ways to do not disagree of this kind of prejudice people and bringing other kinds of gamers to the universe. Even that I agree that the best and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be) a Space Sim. <p> I just hope it will be " persistent enough ". Ben said somewhere in the AMA sessions it will not be as full featured as the official servers, so let 's hope it as features to allow for a satisfying private experience. <p> I 'm worried that people are fixating on the FPS, boarding combat end too much. It 's a space sim, not Counter Strike. <p> But if you 're going to have it, do it right. Make the primary melee weapon be -- an axe. Something that 'd reasonably cut through space suits and a bulkhead or two. It strikes an interesting silhouette, too, compared to a knife or space-crowbar. <p> Call it a nod to Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Or Prometheus, if you 're still pulling placenta out of your ears. <p> Harry Harrison wrote a great story about space boarding -- weapons need to be reactionless otherwise you swing your axe and end up spinning off into space, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as lasers can be defeated easily with reflective armour and slug-throwing weapons are poor due to reaction problems. <p> Still, FPS has no place in a space sim type game. You should be sitting in the cockpit in the comfy chair giving orders to the grunts who run around to your command. Surely seeing your troops running around as little dots in a 3d image of the ship would provide more tension than trying to figure out which way to go next. <p> Can you imagine ordering your troops around the ship, trying to get a limited number of boarding party to the engine room to shut off the shield generator without running into the squads of stormtrooper defenders? Sending orders to direct them without too much casualties... it could be awesome, and much or immersive than the boring old FPS with the single invincible warrior. Yeah, the more I think about it, the less I want any FPS in there. <p> I do n't believe in " FPS has not place in a space sim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a universe. Most of it, in the first place, a Space Sim, but it does n't need to be limited to that. There 's lot room for other kind of game categories, and FPS is one of them for sure? I see room for inovation in Star Citizen( of course -- in the future). You do n't need to play if you do n't want FPS, RTS or whatever different thing that could be created based on this universe. The best thing is having the options available for all kinds of gamers. And if its possible( something that the devs can answer) no reason to do not do it. <p> 1 : More flyable ship classes : More options is better 2 : Tactical command mode on capital ships : Hey, if I 'm going to fly one of the big girls, I expect to have the comfy chair and issue orders. 3 : Run under Linux : Not sure I 'll use it but I want to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- 4:More star systems in Star Citizen : more space is more room for fun. 5:More external fiction( like the Time Capsule and Spectrum Dispatches) : these have been lots of fun. 6:More frequent updates from the development team : I 'd like to know things are moving forward, but I 'll settle for speculation and a good game at the end. <p> I 'd like to be able to set-up specific programmed thruster bursts... Choosing which individual thrusters fire, their duration, their intensity. These " macromaneuvers " could be set-up within the ship itself, meaning it 's something else that could be upgraded... like buying a better computer for the ship allows for number of macromaneuvers stored, complexity they can be, etc.... <p> However, I am concerned that, at this point, part of the slow-down is that people do n't know exactly what they 're getting. The good-faith pledging has been a phenomenal home-run for Star Citizen, but I suspect that many would-be supporters simply do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacking on additional semi-ethereal goal-prizes may not fix this. I admit that my choice of purchasing the Wingnut pledge package was partially determined by the fact that, between it and the Freelancer, I knew from the demo what the Hornet was. <p> I know that we 've been told that the art for the other ships is in the works, and we will, hopefully before the pledging is over, see what these vessels look like. I would suggest, though, that perhaps even seeing some of the concept art -- even early design sketches which resemble the final product, if the formal art will take too long -- may help win over those hesitant to pledge on faith. Part of the passion is from how beautiful the demonstration was. What we 've seen, heard, and read has been spectacular, and has lit the fires of our imagination. <p> Now, the flames in the hearts of those who wish to share your vision, which have burned so brightly these past weeks, seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it. Those who would love the genre but, as some of these great games came out as many as two decades ago, may not as younger gamers have the ready kindling of experiencing your previous works. They look to this sight of which they are told( by word-of-mouth or gamer E-zines), and see the promise of a new game, but perhaps not enough to take its measure. They have had much to read, but have seen only a few brilliant strokes of the brush for what there is to *experience*. To see a stack of stats conveys a concept, but I think many of us will agree that crunching numbers is n't what this is about. It is through these ships that we will experience Star Citizen, for they will be the lens of our immersion. This leads to a great yearning -- to look up at a ship and utter those words which mean worlds : " I 'll get to fly this. " <p> You make an excellent point. Humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're getting in a situation like this. I think releasing concept art is an excellent idea for getting " butts in the seats " as it were. Even if there 's a disclaimer to the effect of " early concept drawing, final ship may be altered or changed without notice " <p> I think that 'd go a LONG way to getting people interested in the game. <p> You 're not just buying a ship though, you 're supporting the game. What you pledge for wo n't be the be all and end all as there will be many more ships on release and in the future. It may not be realistic but it might be nice if these ships that are available for pledging are only available to pledgers even after release. Or at the least VERY hard to acquire in the universe. If suddenly everyone has a Hornet that would just be silly. And sure you get to fly it in the campaign. I think the ships take time to develop however and you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome as everyone else! But I think rarity would put higher value on them for everyone. Make these ships almost the best you can get in game, and then later on add ships that the military have recently brought into service, which could be added into Squadron 42 and be made expensive in the extreme in the universe because even the military have few of them. I know there are balancing issues but it is only right that if you are attacked by a hornet you are in serious trouble, and that your only option should be escape unless you have numbers on your side, which should n't always be the case because no fight is ever completely equal. Imagine if the only way to acquire a constellation in the game is to steal one, or pay a ridiculous amount of credits. <p> disagree ; how could you even think that would be a good idea for a pledger-only ship? how could you think to let pledgers start off with " the best ships in the game " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get those same ships? it is the very definition of " pay to win " that chris, and really, everyone else( except you), is against. <p> More external fiction. I would love books to read while we wait for launch, it would help make the time until alpha/beta/launch go by much faster, plus it 'll help us dive directly into the world of Star Citizen and feel like we 've been living there this whole time, in a sense. <p> I personally, have always wanted to captain a capitol ship. If this game could let me do that, while maintaining the detail of that cockpit, I would throw my money at it. I would throw my money so hard, my monitor would break... <p> Tactical command mode would be wicked awesome, as would more ships to fly at launch. I think it would be sweet if there was a " fire control " officer on bigger ships that directed gunners to targets, as well as fighters. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is realistic or not) is I would like to see the persistent universe ready at closer to the same time as Squadron 42. Personally, I would pour money into having both Squadron 42 AND the persistent universe ready in 24 months, rather than having the universe be bigger at launch. <p> The tactical command is what would thrill me the most from the given options. I also voted for mopre ship classes but I do realize more ships will get added after launch anyway. As I also voted " other " here is what I would really like to see improved/realized : Ship interior and gameplay within the ship. While it seems that the " bobblehead and dinosaur " thing is aiming for that, what I mean is that I want to identify myself with my ship. And by that I mean capships! I want to walk around my **26;2670;TOOLONG and see NPCs I hired to improve the crew. I want to walk into the engine room seeing the brand new 5 Mega-Watt reaction-camber pre-heater that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander into the mess room to talk to my Crew and hear what new upgrades I could use for the hangar deck ans so on... PS : Sorry for the wall of text, hope you get my point. <p> yes this is important, and a accessible AI like EDI in Mass Effect.... you can give Voice commands like " Scan Sector " " Dock on Station " or " bring out us here " if you are attacked while you walking within your ship <p> I voted for Linux, more NPCs, and Other. Linux, not so much because I run it on my computer, but in anticipation of a Steam console. More NPCs, emphasizing quality/uniqueness over quantity. <p> On the Other end of things, I 've been reading over the clubs/pubs/bars thread, and would really love to see fully-realized social areas as soon as possible, areas you can move through in first-person. Visiting planets and bases were half the reason I flew anywhere in Privateer. <p> If I could choose a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That could *really* broaden the audience for Star Citizen. <p> My other is also to flesh out the clubs/pubs/bars significantly more than we had in Freelancer or Privateer. The MPC interactions always felt a little constrained and incomplete taking away from the immersion. There are a number of topics in the forums talking about this to get ideas. <p> I 'm imagining it would be similar to BF2? s commander mode, where you could give individual fighter wings orders and targets( Bomber wing 1, torpedo this. Fighter wing 3, escort bomber wing 1. Destroyers, shield the carrier. Boarding parties, launch at disabled enemy cruiser, etc), while seeing a nice overview of the battle. It would help quite a bit for those 50vs50 fights. <p> This I like. I really enjoyed playing as the commander in BF2, and often got complimented on how I handled the battle. I 'd love to see some kind of map setup like in TIE Fighter, that a commander could assign targets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactical, more star systems, and FPS( for my buddies, that are big into FPS games, this could be a draw for them.) <p> Why would we need T-shirts? About the FPS part, you can see a little bit in the promo video : character walking around the carrier. I guess this has to do with interaction while on cap ships, space stations and planet surface. <p> I 've rarely seen a kickstarter-style t-shirt that would make people look ' trendy '. If there 's text and a logo on the back, you just look like a walking billboard. That 's the kind of t-shirt that only gets worn while painting the house. Ideally, the shirts are plain enough that they look good even if you know absolutely nothing about the game. <p> Well so far im the 1 " other " vote. I would like some extra focus on the exploration portion of the game as in more sites to find/explore/profit. Also industrial and possible manufacturing areas of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone on this <p> I am also with you Markov! It would be really neat if you were able to build your own spacestation or hangar on a moon or planet. And with that build factories or other industrial buildings. So, good idea Markov! <p> I 've voted for a major number of missions in Squadron 42, but i think that a translation( i 'm italian) will be really important... When i was 12-13 and i was playing Wing Commander 1-2 i had the headache trying to undestand all the slang present in the game dialogues... XD <p> The ultimate answer is community-provided language packs. If the language-specific stuff can be split away, the they can be replaced. If these components can be documented and tools provided to modify them, then the community can do this for whatever language they want. Sure, it might not be as professional as the core deliverables, but you should n't underestimate someone out there who will do an excellent job. <p> There 's also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text for all the speech, surely) and anyone can then update those into Italian, or Afrikkaans or whatever without impacting the main project. <p> You are right, but you are understimating a heavy factor : here in Europe, in some country( sadly even mine), people do n't know really good the english language, so, many people here stay distant from the project and from the kickstarter. The level of knowledge of english is so low that i must to translate the kickstarter page for most of my friends! XD If the programmers give initial support to an italian translation( like a spanish one and portuguese), the project and the search for founds would spread even here in Italy( where the project for now is almost unknown, even if a couple of comunity are already online). A good idea could be even to translate the kickstarter page in Italian. <p> There 's something about attacking a large ship with a squad of ships and then boarding it in FPS that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enhanced FPS mode and more rewards! Though, if I had a 4th vote I would have put in for capital ships. Not so much for me but I know it should be an important aspect for this game. <p> Linux is doing well at 15% I think, and with the 14% for Mac, that is a total of almost 30%. That is a potential market share to notice. I think it is important for RSI to remember that Windows 8 will be prevalent when Star Citizen has its full release, and other houses like Valve are not impressed by its gaming qualities. <p> Other houses are not impressed that Windows has it 's own app store built in now. Valve makes a lot of money selling all brands of games. Valve is not particularly eager to see Microsoft as a competitor. <p> As someone who is using Windows 8, I can assure you it has exactly the same " gaming qualities " as windows 7. The win 8 desktop is just the same. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows 8 as far as I 've read, they have only spoken in the vaguest terms about it. They probably just do n't like the idea of the windows app store and xbox on windows competing with steam -- that does n't mean win 8 is any worse for gaming. You probably should n't take their word for it -- they 're looking out for their interests, not yours. <p> Considering the great difficulties that will be involved in trying to bring a cryengine game to linux, would n't you prefer them to spend all their time and budget on making the best windows game they can, rather than splitting their efforts and giving us a diluted game on multiple OS 's? I know I would. <p> no i wouldn't. many of us, myself included, wo n't be able to play it if it 's windows-only. i pledged in the hope we will get a port. besides, it 's not that hard, really, you just do n't know much about it. <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience as a developer is that stuff that is developed for both Linux and Windows, work better on Linux. I do get the point about Valve/Steam getting a competitor though. <p> When all that is said, the poll is now at 22% for Linux( a lot more than Mac). The point is that even if Windows market share in general is huge, a majority of those are not gamers, and certainly not prospective Star Citizen players. They are office computers or grandmas computers. The people buying Macs do it to edit their photos, not play. <p> I think that many of those that truly love the PC, also have quite the understanding for Linux. The sales statistics for the Humble Bundle shows that Linux gamers are starved for quality games, and that they are willing to pay for it. It is n't accidental that Linux has gotten so much attention in this years Kickstarter successes. <p> As for the difficulty porting CryEngine3 -- I do n't buy it. Since they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways OpenGL), they have done the necessary work to abstract the rendering backend from the frontend. If they do n't already have, or do n't intend to make it, it is because they do n't want to, not because it is in any way difficult. <p> @Val-Amart you *wo n't be able to play* if it 's windows-only? You 're running linux on a machine that is n't compatible with windows? Are n't you just choosing not to use windows? And are you telling me that if Star Citizen was windows only, you could n't dual-boot windows in order to play it? <p> Also, if you think it 's not that hard to rewrite cryengine to use OpenGL instead of DirectX, I think you 're the one who does n't know much about it. The whole point of using someone else 's engine is that it will save RSI the work of writing their own -- what 's the point if they then have to rewrite it? <p> @DancingOmelette Dualbooting is full of constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I admit i still have windows on my computer. Imagine a game taking 5 min to load and 5 min to unload, this is what means dualbooting( and win and my motherboard bios are mostly responsible of that time). <p> Apparently Crytech started to think about linux at the beginning of the year. It probably means they have nothing ready in their boxes but they may have it in a few years. http : **27;2698;TOOLONG? page=ne... The real question is not Will Star Citizen develop a multiplatform game? BUT Will CryEngine ensure support for linux and/or mac in time of SC release. This is mostly about making a deal with them! If they are not enthusiastic you should mention how well performing Unigine is getting. If a linux goal is proposed i will double my pledge, and the project will be promoted around the linux community. Think how well humble indie bundle is doing! <p> Oh and please do n't give a try to wine, this is good for games that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem an easy solution, but what it giveth it taketh it away! <p> The boss of Steam does, and I think that 's an important factor. He 's seen the future of Windows gaming and does n't like it, so I think there will be some shift towards Linux. <p> Linux support would mean the game could be released on a standalone, bootable DVD. no installation required. It could also be run on Linux consoles, should powerful enough ones appear, or on your Linux HTPC. So though I think windows is where its at today, I would n't like to assume anything given the state of Microsoft 's intentions. <p> I certainly do n't. It 's already tough enough to get devs to give us good PC versions when they 're only thinking about consoles, and that 's without splitting the PC market over 3 OSs. Do tell, why is linux important in the future of PC gaming? <p> What are you exactly talking about? Playability? This may be caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the same if they are windows only, or linux/mac compliant. <p> If it 's about stability i suggest you to get rid of your MS products. <p> I would not tell linux is important for pc gaming, but linux users love being free and innovative and creative ways to use their hardware, so they love indie games and crowdfunding, so even being few they can help much about bringing pure awesomeness to life and less WWIII commercial crap. So linux is important for good pc gaming. <p> Almost exactly my vote( switch the dev team updates out for more Squadron 42 missions... though for that last spot I really struggled with myself, because more ship classes, more systems and such goals sounded awesome too). Hopefully Linux stays among the top five choices and there might be hope( Crytek willing) for a port. <p> Oh, and we 're just nine point something percent away from the 3M USD stretch goal as of this writing( with each hundredth percent point equalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals named above are not that far away either. *fingers crossed* <p> Cockpit view should be a HUGE priority. Even a sort of bridge view for larger ships would be neat ; however, I strongly emphasize a smaller ship cockpit view because it is a staple in space games and largely defines the game in question. <p> Even if it seems to be now -- I want it to remain that case indefinitely -- for any future updates and installments. If they just assume that we want it, does that mean it will receive constant attention? Or will it fall on the backburner because demand for it was never made clear? <p> Every genre has its defining feature, especially in modern gaming. Lately for shooters, it has been iron sights. For racers, it 's the realism of the driving experience. For space games such as this? It is absolutely the cockpit. <p> I 'm with ya Neckaru. WC1/2 got cockpits perfect. They all had a lot of character and unique details. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship should have its own unique cockpit arrangement, preferably with different displays( maybe different generations of displays even). <p> Me personally, I want more NPC/story stuff. As for first person shooter, to me this is primarily a space sim and I do nt have to much enthusiasm towards it becoming more FPS. <p> I would also like to see more updates from devs and more of the fiction just because for one the fiction has been some of the best scifi i 've read in some while and 2 because I want to know how the game is progressing. <p> Running under lunix or mac is of no interest to me personally. More rewards are nice but at the same time I do nt want to see it start to detract from the rest of the game <p> I agree with more NPC/story stuff. On the FPS note : Was Han Solo always in his ship? Do armed forces only have the air force? Personally I think it would be cool to have some fps content. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get them into the community. The down side to fps would be a lack of maturity with that crowd. Although that could be covered in the fine print : If you destroy imersion in SC with immature nonsense you will be banned. Personally I think being able to do some dirty work with the Marines or SC equalivant would be cool. Also it could make Bounty hunting more interesting. Sorry for being longer than 2 cents. <p> While I am a big FPS gamer, I think FPS would just detract from the overall space sim experience. I 'm still not sure how they would balance a FPS fight inside a spaceship while starships are fighting outside. I mean they ca n't use " instances " because that completely destroys the immersion. I 'm all for the FPS as long as it does n't gimp the space sim side of things, which I do n't see how they could do. I mean, 30 people in space ships dogfighting outside, while another 20 say 10 attackers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time and hopefully no one blows the ship while they 're in it? Seems a bit of a stretch. <p> The FPS game probably would n't be all that separate though, as there are no loading screens between walking around on a ship and flying outside I can definitely see how someone can fly a boarding ship inside a hangar and everyone pouring out of it. If the ship is blown up while the boarding party are still inside they simply die! <p> Did you ever play Star Wars Battlefront?( well, ok, SW BF2) It had a FPS mode. You could attach the capital ship with your X-Wing / Y-Wing, etc. to take out the Shield Generator with your ships weapons or LAND IN IT, eject from your ship, and attack the shield generator internally. That was awesome. Well, honestly, it was a little " cheap ", since it was so much easier to take them out by using a ship, but it was exciting to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but im not agree with zeekez at all on this FPS matter. First of all, im not big fan of FPS and have tendency to hate it. But, what matter to me is if you play as a pirate, you always have choice to release or claiming your ship that you capture and i think the FPS or 3rdPS is only way to deliver this option. Even though its hard to say, its needed, as a part of immersion of this game. For me the only real option for the developer is disable the ability of capturing other player ship and having FPS or 3rdPS out of the game or make it possible while having FPS or 3rdPS on. But then again, if you disable this ability then what 's the point of having an option to play as pirate at all? Because if you choose to be a pirate then you want to have this ability and take any valuable things that come with the ship. Otherwise its pointless to be a pirate at all. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPS:If someone can deliver other option to the discussion with happy heart i will listen to it <p> I have to day that you should always try to do 1 thing well, rather than 2 things adequately. So for me FPS is a no-no. <p> However, there are aspects that can be added that increase the overall tension in a 3rd person FPS way -- eg, a FPS boarding operation is ok, but its better to have a bunch of marines on ship that you can send out to board, while you concentrate on directing them or keeping the shields down while they cut their way in. You do n't have to personally strap on a gun and run down there to individually kick the stuff out of a hundred stormtroopers in some rambo-esque fantasy. Better to build your own troops up and send them in while you manage them in a strategic view, that would keep immersion and add to overall playability much more than a FPS add-on would. <p> If you send in a boarding party, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, not just blow it up after killing/subduing the crew. So does that mean SC will then allow ships to transfer ownership on capture? And who among the capturing party/fleet gets the ownership. <p> If the original ship owner had insurance, does that mean they also get a new ship, or does the capturing party not get the ship because the owner had insurance? <p> Another problem is that a capital ship will require both space sim and FPS players involved, and unless pilots are warped back to the ship( meaning all pilots require both skillsets), you will have FPS players just waiting for a boarding party to enter the ship. <p> Unless the FPS action is only for PvE and optional, I think adding FPS will alienate the space sim fans, which is what SC was initially targeting. And if FPS is only PvE( or PvP arena?) then you have something separate from the rest of the SC universe, which is essentially a completely different game, and likely alienate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat to Star Trek Online, as it has many of STO 's gameplay characteristics. STO has both a starship combat system, and a FPS/3PS combat system. They work very well with each other, especially in regards to missions and the like. And if we were maybe boarding enemy ships in SC, would n't we all like to be able to switch to FPS mode for the encounter, instead of letting the computer " auto-calculate " the results? <p> I agree the FPS stuff should not be the main focus at this point. This is a space Sim first and should be more about flying ships and exploring. There are lots of great FPS games. I do n't want to see them focus to much on this right now. <p> Really surprised how many people are interested in the FPS side of the game. <p> I could n't agree more. There are plenty of dumbed-down FPS out there. I 'd like to see a game with a rich and engaging story line. Customizations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that 'll add replay value to the game. I also think the game needs a large variety of side missions, not just variations of go there &; kill everything. For example freelancer was a game I loved, I think it had a good story. But once you 're done with it this side missions get old fast, and even though the multiplayer adds some value, it 's still more of the same. <p> Looking forward to a game with combination of ; - sandbox mmo spacesim - fps space battles and fps station/planet battle for conquering battleships, stations or Planet resources and the territoriale Alliance ownership of a space area. - periodical event based missions in space where groups or solo can auto join when one pops up. Get an alert when and where its located. No traditional quests or missions as Standard mmos do. - mmo that avoids instance loading... More a system that preloads an area of you are close to it. - in game housing ; rent or buy a personal/corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting. <p> I agree on story and immersion. One of the things that made WC and especially Privateer stand out for me was the " little touches. " For example, the take-off and landing cut-scenes, watching the little thrusters fire as your ship settled onto the landing pad. <p> I realize that to modern( i.e., younger) gamers that may seem silly, but you have to understand that for the time it was pretty revolutionary. Chris Roberts was one of the first developers to understand that in order to make a really stand-out game, you also had to make a good story and give the player a sense of place in the universe. I can still remember the wonderful music by The Fat Man for places like the Pleasure Planet and Oxford. I have forgotten countless games that I 've played in the ensuing 20 years, but those virtual locales are still fresh in my mind after all this time. <p> Like a good story, a good game is not defined by the physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations. Make a good story first, then put a good game into it. <p> Yes we all like updates. But, I work in the games industry myself and I have to say that a lot of time( = money) is wasted if you need to produce polished images and trailers every few weeks. Let them concentrate their efforts on the actual game, not to produce eye candy. Believe me, we have to be patient, but that will result in a better product in the end. <p> Does n't need to be polished images and trailers, I 'd just like to know what they 're up to, how things are going in general and any new developments. And if they can throw in some half finished concept art or some barebones test level footage as well, then all the better. Something like the weekly video updates for Overgrowth would be awesome. <p> A plug-in API like what WoW allows could be awesome. Interested programmers / artists could create custom UIs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good generic one that anybody can use, but a hardcore pirate could maybe load a UI that prioritizes scanners and " police arrival time " over standard gun/shield elements. <p> You could also have things like combat logs so you could analyze your performance after combat was over. <p> Looking forward to a game with combination of ; - sandbox mmo spacesim - fps space battles and fps station/planet battle for conquering battleships, stations or Planet resources and the territoriale Alliance ownership of a space area. - periodical event based missions in space where groups or solo can auto join when one pops up. Get an alert when and where its located. No traditional quests or missions as Standard mmos do. - mmo that avoids instance loading... More a system that preloads an area of you are close to it. - in game housing ; rent or buy a personal/corporation docking area where you can store ships or have a meeting. <p> Would love to see a phone app that let 's you keep updated with what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times a day maybe with some live
