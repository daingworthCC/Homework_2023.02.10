5109641 <h> November 17, 2012 <p> Tonight marks the last game for Kentucky 's seniors. It 's also the end of the Joker Phillips era. I hoped it would n't come to this and I honestly wanted Joker to succeed, however( obviously) he could n't get the job done. The Cats will take on Samford in thirty minutes at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington. There have n't been many times this season that I could say this, but I honestly think the Wildcats will come out on top tonight. <p> Who will take the field at Commonwealth for the last time in a Kentucky jersey tonight : <p> Head Coach Joker Phillips- A guy who will always be remembered for his service and dedication to Kentucky. Phillips was a wide-receiver for the Wildcats from 1981-1984 under Fran Curci and Jerry Claiborne. After his time at UK Phillips went on to play two seasons with the Washington Redskins in the NFL. After his NFL career Joker began coaching college ball. In 2002, he came back to his alma mater to serve as the recruiting coordinator and wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach. Joker succeeded Rich Brooks as head coach in 2008. Unfortunately, Phillips was n't what Kentucky needed in a head coach and his career was only three years. He will be missed, but the BBN is ready for the next chapter of Kentucky football. <p> WR La'Rod King- La'Rod has been a constant and reliable receiver. I would n't be surprised if we see La'Rod in a professional jersey in the future. <p> C Matt Smith- Is Rimington Award candidate, his career as a Wildcat maybe coming to a close but I 'm sure this is n't the last we hear of Matt. He 's a reliable player, who has proudly worn blue and white. <p> DE Taylor Wyndham- No one will ever forget his knock-out hit to Tim Tebow during the Florida game his freshman year. It still brings joy to my heart. <p> WR EJ Fields- Has n't really made a huge splash during his career at UK due to injury, but his junior year he notched 7 catches for 57 yards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton- His freshman year Morgan stepped up when Kentucky did n't have a quarterback to turn around a loosing season and get the Cats to a bowl game. <p> RB Coshik Williams- Enjury kept him from shining during his time at UK, but we 've seen a lot a potential out of him. He 's the one who secured our victory of Tennessee. <p> WR Aaron Boyd- A Lexington player from Henry Clay High School Aaron has become a leader during his senior year. <p> CB Cartier Rice- We 'll never forget when he tipped the interception that secured a Kentucky victory over Steve Spurrier and the Gamecocks in 2010. <p> OL Larry Warford- Is always a dominate guard. We will see him in a professional jersey in the future hopefully. He still has a ton of potential. <p> K Craig McIntosh- A former student try-out who became the starting kicker on scholarship. <p> DL Collins Ukwu -- A great surprise when he signed with Kentucky. He 's a leader on and off the field and was critical during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a crucial 48-yard pass that lead to a touchdown in the Liberty Bowl his freshman year. <p> CB/S Martavious Neloms- has always been a clutch player at Kentucky. One of his most memorable plays would be a sack, fumble, recovery and touchdown as a junior vs. Jacksonville State. <p> S Mikie Benton -- a walk-on player that is now a starting scholarship player. He always plays safe and smart. <p> TE Gabe Corell- a special teams contributor and a top tackler on kick coverage. <p> Looking at Samford : <p> The Samford Bulldogs are coached by former Auburn quarterback Pat Sulivan, who was the recipient of the Heisman Trophy. A FCS squad, Samford has beaten two ranked teams in their division, including No. 6 Wofford. The Bulldogs were just two spots shy of the Top 25 this week. They 're 7-2 this season. They 're most lethal player is Fabian Truss. Truss ranks third nationally in all-purpose yards with 1,026 rushing, 284 receiving and 515 return yards with a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally at the 13th spot with 13 interceptions. Safety, Jaquisiki Tartt has 87 tackles, 14 passes defended and four picks. <p> Tonight will be emotional as
