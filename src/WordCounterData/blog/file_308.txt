5139041 <h> A Changing of the Guard : Williams gets the nod over Harewood <p> The Ravens have opted to make a change at left guard for Sunday 's game against the Dallas Cowboys. <p> Bobbie Williams will replace Ramon Harewood in the starting lineup, according to Aaron Wilson of The Baltimore Sun, who cited two league sources. <p> Harewood, 25, started the team 's first five games. Williams, 36, signed to a two-year, $2.9 million deal that included an $800,000 signing bonus during the offseason, was thought to be the frontrunner for the starting left guard spot throughout training camp and the preseason. <p> Williams started each of Baltimore 's four preseason games but lost the job to Harewood before the regular season. <p> Prior to signing with the Ravens, Williams started 118 games for the Cincinnati Bengals from 2004-2011, including 68 straight from 2006-2010. <p> Williams had surgery to repair a broken ankle last December and, as Wilson noted, his ankle bothered him greatly and constantly swelled up during the preseason. <p> The 6-foot-4, 345-pound Williams played left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Bengals. Since then, he 's played only on special teams. <p> It remains to be seen if this move is permanent. In each of the last two weeks, the offensive line has been dominated on the edges, not the interior, which makes inserting Williams for Harewood a little puzzling. <p> The offensive line has allowed 13 sacks this season, including eight during the last two games. Last week, Chiefs outside linebackers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston each recorded two sacks. <h> About Justin Silberman <p> Justin Silberman was born and raised in the Charm City where he took an interest in sports at a very young age.
