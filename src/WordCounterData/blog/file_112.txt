I used to be an avid amateur photographer -- yearbook editor, the whole thing. Always with the camera. Later on I realized that this was a pretty geeky way to go through life, at least as a teenager( think " AV club "). When I started having a family, I made a conscious decision not to get a video camera. Sometimes when I see the little snippets of movin ' pitchers with my kids on them from when they were little, I wonder whether I made a mistake. But I had decided that I did n't want to experience videos of my experiences at the expense of the experiences themselves. As a photo-bug I realized I was not living in the moment, ever ; I was living in anticipation of how the pictures of the moment would look. <p> Okay, now this was not a fun or a warm or a happy moment -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in general, I feel the reality of life slipping away in favor of not only the virtual, but the digital or, perhaps, the digitized. Do we all really have to be journalists, all the time? <p> UPDATE : Links to this from Glenn Reynolds and Ed Driscoll -- always nice of a late Wednesday night, and my first hookup with Ed -- yet I ca n't help but think they did n't either of them read the whole piece! They both elided right past a classic, " It is true... but " throwaway acknowledgment formula used all the time to make a completely opposite point -- by journalists. <h> No Responses to " All journalism, all the time " <p> Bloomberg( the wire service, not the mayor) reports:An explosion was reported near the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 41st Street near Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal, the New York City Police Department said.

I see them already today staying in near-constant contact with their friends, no matter how distant. As digital channels broaden and deepen, you 'll be able to be " with " the people who matter to you and experience the things they experience any time you like. Yes, there are times and experiences where only physical presence is good enough ; but those will become less and less common. <p> Martin, you have already succumbed to the virtual world. Physical presence is first reality, all of the time. When you are with your friends through a " digital channel, " you are with a digital channel... NOT your friends. The friends part is a replication. <p> Who thinks you can really know a Rembrandt by looking at a photograph of a Rembrandt??? <p>... by Ron Coleman on August 19th, 2007 Oh, we 've said for a long time that journalism is something you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in, and something else that bloggers have been... <p> I 've made a career here of tut-tutting the impolitic and brand-negating utterance of baseless cease and desist and other threatening letters based on IP infringement, including this recent post about the Louis Vuitton / University of Pennsylvania dustup.
