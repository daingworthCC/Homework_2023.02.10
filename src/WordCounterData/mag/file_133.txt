2016841 SANCTUARY, SHOWCASE, OR FORTRESS, THE HOME IS A REFLECTION OF HUMAN VALUES AND LIFESTYLES. HERE IS A DANISH VISION OF TOMORROW 'S DREAM HOMES. Home is your castle ; it is a fortress against outside invaders, a sanctuary from external stress. Home is where you hang your hat ; you sleep, shower, change clothes, and occasionally eat there. Home is where your heart is ; you invite over your friends and relatives, greet important visitors such as your boss and favored clients. The home is the most personal of all human habitats, and the home of the future -- from its furniture to its landscaping -- will accommodate the distinct needs, values, and lifestyles of tomorrow 's homeowners. While some castle-keepers will want to hold on to the traditions of the past, others will want the latest in high-tech home communications and entertainment. Denmark 's Institute for Futures Studies in Copenhagen took on the task of developing a set of alternative visions of what Danish families of tomorrow will want their homes to be like. The Institute found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the so-called " smart house. " Some 30% said, in essence, that any change should be ignored and that the only things that matter are the basic, eternal needs of the family. On the other hand, 15% reported a fascination with change, according to Karen Schousboe, head of research at the Institute. These are the avantgarde who enjoy fashion and fads. Some of the things that the Institute believes almost all Danes will share in the next 10 to 20 years include more pressure on available time due to longer workdays ; increased interest in hobbies, health activities, and cultural pursuits ; more space in the home due to smaller family sizes ; increased interest in the environment and nature, manifesting itself in landscape designs and gardening, especially organic foods. " The project ended up by presenting a number of visions for the future of the home, " Schousboe told THE FUTURIST. " These visions were presented as a( long) list of conclusions, stories in the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we worked in the project, plus finally a long list of new products( about 1,000), which were developed during seminars at the Institute. Finally, we had a designer draw up visions of a number of " homes of the future " based on the conclusions reached in the seminars. " The project 's artist, Philip Bro Ludvigsen( called one of Denmark 's brightest young designers by Design magazine of London), illustrated four different homes of the future. Each home scenario was assigned a family name, representing one of four archetypal sets of Danish values and lifestyles that were then projected into the dreams and desires of tomorrow 's homeowners. * THE HANSEN HOME. Representing the largest segment of Danish population( 40%), the " Hansen " family home is a traditional single-family house with a garden. The Hansens expect their home to be a fortress against the outside world 's uncertainty ; their dream is for a future of certainty, stability, and constancy. * THE PETERSEN HOME. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm. Individual sections of the garden and individual rooms in the house have strictly separate identities. For instance, the kitchen is the " togetherness " room, while another room would be used solely for relaxation and meditation. About 35% of the Danish population are Petersens -- a higher proportion than would be found among the U.S. population, says Schousboe. The Petersen dream : a visibly coherent life. * THE FRANDSEN HOME. The " Frandsen " family( about 15% of the population) has much the same values as the Hansens but is wealthier. The Frandsens have more-adventurous tastes than the Petersens. The Frandsens use their home as a showcase and emphasize stylishness and status. The home " is always ready to receive unexpected visitors, " says Schousboe. The Frandsens dream of economic and social prosperity, but not of change. * THE FOX HOME. The smallest group, about 10% of the Danish population, the " Fox " family is a family on the move, viewing the home almost as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring many high-tech devices, are almost Spartan in their functional efficiency. The Fox family dreams of a creative, adventurous life full of change. Schousboe notes that formatting such visions of the future based on models of lifetypes is valuable in other forecasting endeavors. For instance, the model developed at the Institute is also being used to predict the future office and the child of tomorrow. <p>
