2007741 What makes a suit so great that a man will cross an ocean for it? Quality is what it is all about : the difference between perfection and anything less. Since the first tailors moved into Savile Row in the early half of the 19th century, this narrow street in London 's Mayfair district has been the mecca for seekers of traditional British, " gentlemen 's tailoring and today continues to set a standard for craftsmanship and elegance that is admired all over the world. But of all the extraordinary Savile Row tailors, Anderson &; Sheppard, Ltd., best exemplifies-and upholds-the bespoke experience. For nearly a hundred years, it has created fluid, flattering silhouettes for dignified statesmen and debonair stars, from Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Fred Astaire to Manolo Blahnik, Bryan Ferry, Calvin Klein and the Prince of Wales( hence the royal warrant engraved on its window). The secret : Anderson &; Sheppard 's softly constructed jackets, which offer an ease of movement that created a revolution in men 's tailoring long before Giorgio Armani. " Basically, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains managing director David Williams. " While other tailors make a stiff shell and the body stands up inside it, we make a soft suit with a natural shoulder, which follows the form. " Photograph Photograph Upstairs, downstairs : While Anderson &; Sheppard 's retail space, on the ground floor of No. 30 Savile Row. opposite, is well known to clients, few ever see the seven rooms above. where much of the firm 's extraordinary work is done. In these hushed quarters, fourteen tailors-including the one seen here in the coat workshop-painstakingly construct the suits that have made the firm a legend. // I was lucky enough to be introduced to Anderson &; Sheppard more than ten years ago, and I was immediately struck by the unimaginable comfort of the suit the firm made for me. After years of conventional tailoring, I delighted in being freed from a buttoned-up childhood -- in every sense of the word. To define the Anderson &; Sheppard experience : the suit jackets contain little or no padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shoulders. The way that the fabric is draped adds a slight fullness to the chest and back. The sensuous softness of the suit approaches that of a cardigan, but it never loses its appropriateness as business attire. The pleated trousers are cut comfortably full in the thighs but are tapered along the legs and have generous cuffs. The fit is sublime, and the overall effect is one of supreme elegance and comfort. In my Anderson &; Sheppard suits, I feel as handsome as Cary Grant and( almost) as ready to dance as Fred Astaire. Exuberant newcomers on the Row, such as tailor Richard James just across the street, may go in for acres of plate-glass windows and minimalist white space, but Anderson &; Sheppard retains its original 1920s mahogany paneling and fittings-and therein, too, lies some of its charm. A great barn of a shop, with bolts of cloth in its windows and piled high on massive tables, it has the hushed tone and distinguished but slightly faded atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shetland-tweed shooting socks, ties and country caps, as well as colorful felt and regimental-stripe braces, scarves, cozy sheepskin slippers and bright country-check lamb's-wool rugs and throws.Without expert guidance from your salesman, it would be impossible to choose from the marvelous selection of special fabrics used for suits, jackets, trousers and coats : Glen plaids, chalk stripes, pinstripes and herringbones, all designed exclusively for Anderson &; Sheppard, many since the 1930s. Rich Shetland tweeds and country suitings in subtle colors and patterns are a particular specialty. Once you have made your choice for a suit, the " cutter " -there is one for above the waist and one for below-then makes the pattern, and a tailor tacks together the material to prepare for your first fitting. From start to finish, it can take the five or six men involved in making your suit eight to ten weeks to accomplish the task, with two or three fittings. As befits its clientele, atmosphere and traditional approach, the firm has a reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever discussing any detail regarding any customer( and quite understandably so-I would n't want my tailor saying a word, knowing the defects of my body as he does!). Anderson &; Sheppard is also steadfast in remaining among the few Savile Row tailors whose suits are made entirely by its own staff of tailors( either on the premises or from their home workshops) men who sometimes make suits for the same customer for most of their working lives. About 70 percent of the stitching is done by hand, including button- and cuff-holes ; machine stitching is allowed only for a few seams and for darts and pockets.When at last a discreet label is stitched on the inside pocket, bearing the name Anderson &; Sheppard along with your own, your pursuit of sartorial perfection is complete.

Next, a pattern is made( and later stored in the pattern room, seen here). Then, John Hitchcock or another " cutter " -there are three for coats and two for trousers-cuts cloth from the pattern. Last, tailors sew the garment together, mostly by hand, " absolutely in the tradition we have always done, " says managing director David Williams. // <p>
