2013141 A Q &; A on talking to kids about death // CHILDREN ARE PRONE TO THE MOST creative interpretations of death - some poignant, others just a bit startling. When one little girl heard her sister had become an angel, she asked her mother if she 'd seen her grow wings and fly away. A three-year-old boy, after staring at his grandmother 's open casket, abruptly turned and asked the crowd of mourners, " Who shot Grandma? " Children want and need to know about death, yet we are often reluctant - even squeamish - when talking about it. Perhaps we want to protect our children from the harsh truth. In a sense, we may be protecting ourselves too, as children can seem quite tactless in their quest for understanding. It 's certainly unsettling when your five-year-old daughter asks what Uncle John looks like now - a year after he 's been dead and buried. Experts agree, however, that we 're not doing our children any favours by shielding them from death and dying. " We live in a world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to talk about a dying or dead person, " says Sue Bourque, a parent educator in Victoria. Yet, she points out, we have no qualms about exposing our children to TV programs and videos in which a character dies. For many children, their first exposure to death happens in an F-rated flick. " It 's almost as though the video has become the teacher. It 's incredibly unhealthy. " At the same time, we do n't want to induce nightmares or intensify their trauma. We want to teach our children about death in a healthy, developmentally appropriate way. Here are a few questions that might be on your mind - and some expert help in providing the answers : My son is five, and I 'm not sure he really understands what death is. How can I explain it? Children younger than six, says Bourque, " live in a magical world, so death is n't permanent for them. " Because they interpret things so literally, they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop living : A dead person 's heart does n't beat, she does n't breathe, she ca n't hear, she ca n't feel pain. Without an explanation like this, a child may come up with his own fantasies about death, and sometimes imagined truths are more frightening or disturbing than reality. It is important for parents to open up the discussion, explore what their children think about dying and loss, and correct any misinformation they have. " With all children, you want to be clear, simple and concrete in giving them information about death and loss, " says Pauline Johnson, acting bereavement coordinator at Victoria Hospice in BC. She emphasizes that children at different ages require different degrees of discussion. " It 's very important to meet the child at their level of understanding. " Not only should a parent take age into consideration, but also children 's individual temperaments. A resilient 10-year-old may be able to handle an explanation of suicide ; the same information can be shocking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own death, and she worries about her dad and me dying. How can I help her deal with her fears? Make it clear that, for most people, death is n't going to happen until they reach old age. Tell your children what you personally do to keep healthy and safe, such as eating well and wearing a seat belt. " Parents need to reassure children that it is rare for people to die young, and that they are healthy and expected to live long lives, " says Arlette Lefebvre, a child psychiatrist at Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children. Agnes Struik agrees, cautioning parents to avoid promising children that they will always be around. " But be clear with them that most children have both their parents for a long time. An accident is an unusual thing. " Struik, a children 's consultant for Bereaved Families of Ontario, says that when young children display these fears, " usually they are suffering from some sort of separation anxiety. " Lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help ease their distress. Even older children may worry about being suddenly orphaned -but do n't be too flattered. " Often this is less about concern for you than about " How will I survive? ' ' " says Johnson. Tell children that even though it 's unlikely you 'll die when they 're young, you have made plans for their care in the event that anything should happen. Let them know that Uncle Dan and Aunt Cheryl have agreed to look after them. And if you have n't yet come up with a strategy? " Parents might take this as a good opportunity to make those plans. " What if I get upset while talking about a loved one 's death? We 're all human, and there are moments when it 's just overwhelming, " says Johnson. If a parent truly feels she ca n't handle talking about the death at a particular moment, she can ask for help from a relative, close friend or even a teacher who may be equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unsettling and even frightening for a child to see a parent in emotional disarray, Johnson says, " it 's important for kids to know what was going on for you, to see you recover from those feelings and talk about what you do to feel better. " Children take their cues from adults, so when they see parents recover from grief, " it helps them to know that they can learn those skills as well. " Sometimes parents mourning a spouse will spell themselves off by sending their children to a close relative for a few days. But Struik warns that young children may find this discomforting. " Sometimes children feel as though they 've lost both parents. " I 'm trying to be open and honest, but is there anything I should n't say? We really encourage people not to use euphemisms, " says Johnson. " They often lead to misunderstanding for children. " A case in point is the little girl who imagined her sister as an angel with wings. Telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a specific meaning for her. Perhaps he remembers when Grandma went to Florida -and came back. Do n't say the loved one has passed away or is gone. And never tell a child that death is like going to sleep. " It may scare young kids from going to sleep, " says Lefebvre. Lefebvre adds : " Children 's questions need to be answered as honestly as possible, in age-appropriate words. But parents need to use their judgment also. For instance, a young child may not benefit from knowing all the gory details of a car accident or suicide. " By age nine or 10, children sometimes do persist in asking for those gory details. In her private psychotherapy practice, Struik will ask them, " Can you tell me what it is you want to know, what it is that worries you? " She explains : " There 's usually something else underneath that. " Perhaps the child needs to know that his parent did n't suffer. If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " They died very quickly, " and " It did n't hurt for long. ' ' " If there was a lot of pain, keep the explanation simple and emphasize that " Daddy does n't hurt anymore. " What should I tell my child about an afterlife if I do n't believe in one? " Parents should always be honest about their own beliefs, but emphasize tolerance for beliefs other than their own, " says Lefebvre. However, although it 's important to be truthful, you may wish to wait on pushing your own ideas until you 've heard from the child. Let him share his own thoughts with you and be open. Usually, says Struik, as a child goes through his own developmental stages, he 'll come to his own conclusions. " It does n't help a child to suddenly say, " No, that 's not what happens. " To take that away would be really painful for them. " My mother is dying. Is there any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it happens? A lot of children are referred to Lefebvre to help them prepare for the death of a parent. " I start by explaining the disease or condition that doctors are trying to help mom or dad with, then introduce the notion that sometimes doctors run out of medicines or operations to help people with this disease, and finally, the fact that the parent may not be around much longer. " Generally, these conversations take place over weeks or months. Bourque recently helped her own neice and nephew through the loss of a 12-year-old relative, who died of leukemia. " The children around her knew she was dying. They could see the tears. " Bourque explained to them that this was an illness not many children get, and that although treatments are available, unfortunately they were n't working for Elizabeth. " They needed to hear that honesty. They needed to be in the loop. " Let your child know that the doctors have been doing everything they can do, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that the loved one is not choosing to die. Help them find ways to offer comfort -like bringing a favourite stuffed toy, a note or flowers to the hospital. Teaching opportunities can crop up years before a loved one dies. Parents can find lots of examples of the life cycle in nature, as leaves fall and flowers fade. A lifeless bug discovered in the backyard might be a starting point for discussion. After my husband died, my son would be crying one minute, and then tearing off to play the next. Is this a normal way for a child to express grief? " Children go through a play-grief-play cycle, " says Struik. " They are very good at knowing how much they can take. When they 've had too much, they 're out the door - but then they come back again. " " Children grieve in all kinds of ways, " agrees Lefebvre. They may become outspoken and angry, acting out physical behaviours, or they may become withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, no matter what the child 's age, or new anxieties may develop - such as fear of the dark. Young children will often become clingy and tearful. Basically, says Johnson, parents can expect " any behaviour that departs from normal. " Parents can help by updating other adults in the child 's life, such as teachers. Let them know that the child may be more sensitive or may have trouble concentrating, and ask them to speak with you if this happens. Young children may need extra hugs and snuggles. For older children, Johnson recommends a " side-by-side activity " to provide a safe setting that encourages discussion. " Less verbal children may not sit and talk face to face about their feelings, but if you go kick a ball around or drive in the car, that 's when they begin to talk. " Should kids go to the funeral? Unless a child is adamantly opposed to it, he should be involved in this ritual. Explain the funeral in advance so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be tears, and remind him that 's OK. If he wishes, allow him to take on a role - a preteen can help seat people, while an eight-year-old can contribute an anecdote to be read with the eulogy. Just remember that a child has a short attention span and can get easily overwhelmed. Arrange for someone to step in if needed. Let your child know that Aunt Karen will be there to take her out for a walk when she 's ready. " Sometimes having a school friend at the funeral will be comforting to the child, " Johnson suggests. Should children view an open casket? And what do I say about cremation? Although many children are comfortable viewing an open casket, others have nightmares about it. Struik has known several children to crawl right inside the casket with the deceased person. Others will clearly say, " I do n't want to look. " Give the child a choice, explaining what she might expect to see - the eyes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different - and take her lead. If a body is cremated, let the child know this does n't hurt. Explain that it was what Uncle Jeff wanted, and that his ashes will be sprinkled in a place that was special to him. Keep it factual. " Children do n't think it 's so weird, " says Struik. " Kids are capable of working through the notion of dying and grief in healthy ways, " says Bourque, " as long as there 's an adult around to give them support and the agespecific knowledge that they need. " It 's true, when we make an effort to push aside our own anxieties, we are rewarded with the wonderful openness of children.
