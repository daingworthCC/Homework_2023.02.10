2032241 A computerized motion analysis system helps BioVision Sports perfect your golf swing. // It 's been a rough round. Your drives off the tee are hooking and slicing wildly for no apparent reason. Your approach shots have no bite. Long irons? Forget it. Yet, you ca n't figure out what you 're doing wrong. You 're all over the place. Luckily, you 're not out with your regular foursome, catching grief from your pals with each errant shot. In fact, you 're kind of glad you 're having one of your bad days. Because in a few minutes, you 'll know exactly what you 're doing wrong and you 'll be able to make corrections and adjustments fast. In fact, you 'll soon have a complete analysis of your golf swing that will graphically-and painfully-show you every single little flaw in your game. Because you 're not on a course at all. You 're in the BioVision Sports Center in Indian Wells, Calif., and you 're wired up and being digitized as you make each of your agonizingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the major golf tournament TV broadcasts. You watch as a muscular-looking cartoon figure powers through a swing in slow motion. As each frame advances it leaves behind a ghosted image of the one before, so you can track the path of the club and the movement of the body from start to finish. It also leaves behind the indelible impression that your swing, in contrast, sucks. The announcers draw lines highlighting head and body movement. The image spins around to an overhead view that shows hip and shoulder rotation. A few more mouse clicks and you 're analyzing the spine angle from behind. With this kind of technology, it 's no wonder John Daly 's got the juice. This is the power of BioVision, 3D modeling software that has animated dozens of national golf broadcasts since its inception in 1989. And now it is available to the public, although you 'll probably have to travel. Besides the 3D animation, the reason BioVision is so popular with both broadcasters and viewers-and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords. The system operates at 120 frames per second, compared to 24 and 30 frames per second for film and video, respectively. Then it interpolates an extra frame between each of the originals, for a grand total of 240 frames per second. Overall, BioVision processes more than 100,000 bits of information during a 1.5-second golf swing. All that data is used to create a 3D model that can be viewed from any angle at the click of a mouse. Rather than the flat perspective offered by video, you can see your swing headon, from behind, three-quarters, directly above, directly below virtually anywhere.

The red lights are the infrared cameras and dots on the golfer are retroreflective markers. Below : An overhead view shows hip and shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club. // The variety of viewing angles works well with BioVision 's other features. For instance, the system lets the operator impose a background grid and draw lines onscreen. These tools provide a means for measuring club motion and body position during the swing. Unlike standard swing-speed indicators that record speed only at impact, BioVision tracks club speed throughout the stroke. This provides useful information about club acceleration and deceleration, as well as impact speed. And the system tracks the ball 's initial path and estimates its trajectory. The starting point for all this technology is a windowless room with black walls that minimize ambient ultraviolet light. Such light would interfere with the seven highspeed, infrared digital cameras that are positioned about the space. The darkness allows the cameras to focus on objects covered with a special, highly reflective tape. The golfer is outfitted with 21 of these " retro-reflective markers. " They are positioned on all the golfer 's joints, up his back, on his head and along the club. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with markers through the focal area of the cameras. As the cameras record the movement, a computer compares the readings to the stored coordinates for the test object, thus calibrating the system. Then the golfer steps up and starts hitting balls. As he swings, the cameras record the movement and the computer reads the input and stores it. Each reflector shows up onscreen as a dot. By connecting the dots, the computer makes a stick-figure representation of the golfer swinging the club. Next, operators use BioVision 's proprietary software to apply the image of the computer-animated golfer to the stick figure, allowing anyone to view the swing in full 3D animation. Until now, wannabes could only watch BioVision applied to the pros on TV. But the first public BioVision Sports Center is now open at Indian Wells Golf Resort. Another center will open soon in Annapolis, Md., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and Hawaii are on the short list as well. For $200 anyone can have a BioVision session and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session includes a 30-minute analysis and improvement session with a pro. If you 're really dedicated to the idea, there are 1-, 3- and 5-day schools with repeated use of BioVision that range from $695 to $1395. It may be just the thing to animate your golf game.
