2034941 We put our money on the line and traded with eight Web brokerages. Here are the best... no bull. By Douglas Gerlach // Point, click, tradethese three little words sum up the allure of online stockbrokers. Using nothing more than an Internet connection and an account with an online broker, you can buy and sell shares of stocks and mutual funds with mere keystrokes. No waiting to place an order with a brokerage house, no high commissions gobbling up big pieces of your nest egg. Little wonder, then, that 6 million plucky investors have already exchanged the security of traditional brick-and-mortar brokerage houses for the promise of cheap, fast online transactions and reams of late-breaking information about the hottest properties on the market. But is the trade-off worth it? UNDERCOVER TRADERS POSING AS ORDINARY investors, we opened accounts with eight online brokers : market leaders Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Datek, DLJdirect, E-Trade, and Waterhouse, as well as promis- ing upstarts Discover Brokerage Direct and Suretrade. At each site, we tested how easy it is to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help. We pestered each firm 's customer service department via e-mail and by telephone, both while the market was open and when it was closed. We also gauged the site 's ease of navigation and the usefulness of its stock research tools. We discovered that no broker has it all. Your choice will depend on what 's important to you. If you need a little handholding, you 'll want a firm that excels at customer service. If you want fast, no-nonsense stock trades, look for a broker that caters to frequent traders. And if you crave the cheapest trading, be prepared to wing it when it comes to getting answers to your questions. Check out -What Kind of Broker Is Right for You? " on page 180 for our recommendations based on four different investment strategies-one of which is probably yours. GOING FOR BROKER IF YOU THINK you can start trading as soon as you finish this article, think again. While some brokers, like DLJdirect and Suretrade, do n't require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least $2000, and they do n't take plastic. Allow at least five business days for your check to arrive and clear before your account gets started. The only exception : DLJ direct lets new customers trade as soon as their accounts are approved, usually within seconds of applying. You 'll probably need an hour or two to find and decipher the brokerage 's minimum deposit requirements, fees, commissions, and account terms. Discover and DLJdirect were the best at providing this information ; at E-Trade and Suretrade, we could n't find it easily. But once our deposits had landed, trading was easy. In most cases, our initial order to buy shares of stock was filled in mere seconds-before we could even move from the confirmation screen to the order-status screen. Of course, the more you trade, the more you pay in commissions. That 's why low-cost Web brokers are attractive to investors who trade a lot. Instead of the typical $100 to $175 fee a traditional broker charges, you can pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $30( Schwab). A limit order, which designates the maximum price you 're willing to pay for a stock, might cost a few dollars extra. And with most online brokerages, placing trades by phone-via an automated system or by talking to a flesh-and-blood broker-will run you a bit more. // RATING THE BROKERS // RATING THE BROKERS // One great advantage of online trading is easy access to more reports and charts than you 'll find in any discount broker 's office. Though this information is available elsewhere on the Web for free, the best brokers merge it directly into your portfolio display-offering links to quotes, charts, and news of your holdings, so you can keep tabs on your investments. Charles Schwab, Discover Brokerage Direct, and DLJdirect are the best at integrating research into customers ' portfolio views. And keep in mind that though we only rated brokerages on their stock trading capabilities, you might also want to consider how a firm stands up when it comes to mutual funds, bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a place to park your retirement funds, all of these firms offer IRA, Roth IRA, and other retirement accounts-just watch out for the annual fees that are frequently charged for these plans. HELP WANTED WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING HELP, nearly all the firms could use a lesson in customer care. Few of the brokers responded to our e-mailed questions in what we considered a timely fashion. The best of the bunch was Charles Schwab, whose representatives even telephoned us in response to one of our e-mail inquiries. At the other end of the spectrum, Suretrade 's software system sent back immediate responses to our questions, but they were nearly always wrong or incomplete. We also spent an average of 5 minutes on hold waiting for customer service representatives, no matter what time of day or night we called. But once we were connected, most representatives were knowledgeable and helpful, if sometimes hurried-more than a couple rushed through our call. IS YOUR MONEY SAFE? IF THE THOUGHT of spending thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flutter, relax. All online brokers require that you use a secure browser to connect to their sites, so information flowing between the broker and your computer is encrypted, and thus protected from prying eyes on the Net. Since brokers send funds only to an account 's address of record, the account ca n't be raid ed. " The worst thing any hacker could do is make malicious trades, " according to Steve Hall, senior analyst with Gomez Advisors, a financial services research group. If you 're concerned about getting online on a busy market day, do n't worry. Most Web brokers provide online service guarantees, in which the online rate is honored if the network goes down and you have to make a phone call.( Sometimes, of course, the market is downright volatile. PC World 's Web site-see the box above left-has more on the ability of online brokers to handle such crises.) Keeping these assurances in mind, we jumped feet first into the trading pit. Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively painless. And while no online brokerage excels in all areas, we 'd happily give up trading by touch-tone phone or talking with a live broker for the ease and speed of placing orders with an online outfit. Ameritrade A SQUARE DEAL AMERITRADE ISa study in contrasts. Its opening pages are bold, colorful, and slow to download, but inside, the pages are sleek and stark. It offers one of the lowest minimum commissions around, but hidden fees quickly raise the ante. And though the site is festooned with testimonials from satisfied customers, its customer service policies are less than ideal. // WHAT KIND OF BROKER IS RIGHT FOR YOU? // The best part of Ameritrade is access to MarketGuide research, which includes a free stock screening tool and regular data updates. Unfortunately, there 's no way to get information about a company from all of Ameritrade 's research suppliers at once. And while the site features daily commentary from Andrew Tobias, one of the most knowledgeable financial writers around, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Ameritrade 's $8 commission for online orders ties with Suretrade 's for the cheapest of the bunch. When you use the touch-tone service, the commission is $12, and it jumps to $18 if you place your order with a broker directly. Limit orders cost $5 extra. Three of the firms in our survey charge extra for limit orders, and those little charges start to add up after a while. But because Ameritrade 's fee schedule is buried, it 's hard to know how much an account might cost you. Ameritrade 's customer service also seemed wanting : We 're still waiting for a response to one of our e-mail queries. Phone service was better, but we were dismayed by some of what we heard. When we asked what would happen if Ameritrade 's servers were down when we wanted to place a trade, the agent said we could use the brokerage 's touch-tone system or talk with a broker directly. Fair enough, but Ameritrade does n't honor the online rate in that case. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor the lowest commission if their technical problems prevented us from trading. For cautious investors, the less-than-friendly " market meltdown " policy might tip the scales against this otherwise decent site. Charles Schwab MR. POPULARITY TAKING THREE times as many online trades a day as the next most popular site, Charles Schwab is the undisputed king of online brokers. Why do so many investors like Schwab? One reason is that the brokerage firm offers white-glove treatment, including discounts on commissions and the chance to participate in IPOs, for active traders and customers with big accounts. Schwab 's online securities research is another. Just type in a ticker symbol, and up pop news, charts, analyst and industry reports, earnings estimates, and updates on insider trading activity. You can find this information elsewhere on the Web, but you wo n't find it arranged as intelligently as it is at Schwab. Of course, these extras will cost you. At a minimum of $30 a trade, Schwab is the most expensive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest minimum initial investment( $2500) and levies a maintenance charge on accounts that are smaller than $10,000. If you do n't have at least $10,000 to open a stock trading account, you should probably avoid the firm -- commissions will eat up too much of each purchase. If you do have $10,000 to invest, you 'll like Schwab 's sensibly arranged order-entry screens, rapid confirmation messages, and customer service. We received timely responses to our e-mail inquiries-an agent even called us to respond to an emailed question three times, at work and at home. We did pretty well using the phone, too. It took an average of 11 minutes during off-peak hours and 2 minutes during the market day to reach agents, but they wasted no time answering our questions. And if you really need help, you can drop by one of Schwab 's 270 branch offices and talk with someone face-to-face. Datek FAST COMPANY IF YOU WANT your hand held online, steer clear of high-powered Datek. You wo n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be costly to place a trade with a real person. But Datek 's claim to fame is n't customer-friendly accoutrements, it 's speed. Hard-core traders will appreciate the Express Server interface, which slips the standard " Are you really really sure you want to make this trade? " confirmation screen. For the less confident investor, Datek also offers the standard trading interface, as well as a " classic " interface free of fancy graphics. If you place an order with Datek and it 's not executed within 60 seconds, the commission fee is waived( assuming, of course, that the order is marketable). And Datek will honor the $10 online commission rate if the network goes down during trading hours and you 're forced to place an order by phone. If your own ISP ever fails, Datek provides a dial-up number so you can connect directly to its servers. Customer support was pretty peppy, too. We got answers to some-not all-of our e-mailed questions within two business days, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, rattling off answers as fast we could ask the questions. With this emphasis on getting down to business, the site wo n't win any design awards. But it is easy to navigate. And if you feel the need for speed, Datek ca n't be beat. Last December Datek announced plans to operate its Island trading network as a stock exchange. If that happens, customers might be able to get even better prices on stock trades, an important consideration for frequent traders. Discover // Information Please // Wall Street Meets Easy Street // ROCKY START DISCOVER BROKERAGE DIRECT is a site with big ambitions. An ad campaign last fall suggested that by trading with Discover, you could earn enough to buy an island. But we hit some choppy water. For one thing, it took more than a week of e-mails, calls, and faxes to activate our account. Once it was open, we found some things to like. For instance, it 's easy to customize your home page with specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information : Just point and click the items you want to see when you log on. And news, charts, reports, and quotes are available from your portfolio view. You can also purchase stock reports. The order-entry screen was logically arranged, and our order was filled within two minutes. But at the confirmation screen, we had to scroll down to get details on our trades, listed in hard-to-read rows. Discover 's online and touch-tone commissions start at $15 for a market order and $20 for a limit order. But if you place a trade by phone, the commission jumps to 1.5 to 2 cents per share( depending on whether the stock you trade is listed on NASDAQ or an exchange), with a minimum of $34. Since Discover Brokerage Direct is owned by investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, we wo n't write off the site 's chances for success. But it 's hard to find many compelling reasons to fall in with Discover at this stage of the campaign. DLJdirect LIKELY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been " Most Likely to Succeed " in high school. Lean, good-looking, and a little aloof, the site took home mostly Bs on its report card, an occasional A, and only a few low grades. The site 's design made it easy to log on, move around, and place an order. But attractiveness comes at a cost : The site 's reliance on graphic buttons and menus can slow things down-not a strong point for the active trader. The application form, however, is good for those who want instant gratification. Upon completion, your account can be approved for trading, with no minimum opening balance. If your credit is good, you can buy and sell stocks in seconds. Within a few days, you 'll receive a form to sign and return with a check. Our trade order was filled almost at once. The minimum commission is $20, whether you trade by modem or phone. DLJ 's telephone representatives, all licensed by the National Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were average-around 5 minutes-no matter when we called. But we never got a response to questions we sent by e-mail. DLJdirect 's selection of research tools, midrange commission rates, and 24hour weekday phone access might be just the right mix for slower-paced investors. And if you have $100,000 or more in an account, you could get in on the ground floor of an IPO offered by DLJdirect 's parent company, the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &; Jenrette. E-Trade IT AI N'T EASY E-TRADE WANTS to be all things to all people. In addition to trading, the site offers a range of investment ideas, message boards, and other freebies to anyone looking to improve their financial wellbeing. But all these extras also make trading on the site a much more complicated affair than it needs to be. E-Trade tossed a surprising number of obstacles in our path. Casual visitors must register as " members " to access some of the financial research tools. But if you decide to become a " customer, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and password( as we did). And anytime we moved from a customer area to a member area, we had to log in. Worse : We also had to enter a password every time we wanted to buy or sell a holding.( Suretrade is the only other broker in the bunch that requires a separate trading password.) Still, minimum commissions are a flat $15 for online or phone transactions, and the trading screens are intuitively organized. Once we had all our passwords and user names straight, we were able to access E-Trade 's research tools. By entering a stock 's ticker symbol into a search field, we tapped into nearly 20 pages of detailed reports and charts, mostly provided by Disclosure 's Baseline service. But to get real-time stock quotes, we had to fill out another registration form. E-Trade does provide unlimited stock quotes once you do register-a bonus most other firms do n't offer. // Buried Deep // Stock Racer // We spent more time on hold when calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other firmover 10 minutes. Even so, the reps were knowledgeable and helpful, and e-mail support was better than most brokers ' '. With practice, a user could get used to E-Trade 's registration levels and multiple passwords. But in the competitive Net broker business, we wonder how many will want to. Suretrade NOT A SURE BET SUREIRADE EMPHASIZES nofrills services at a minimum commission of $8. And no frills is what it delivers. Opening an account at Suretrade is tedious work. You can do it on the site, but you have to fill out a long form, and then print, sign, and return an online service agreement along with your check. Suretrade then requires five business days for your personal check to clear. So while you can open your account right away, expect to wait another week or two before you can make your first purchase. We also found it hard to navigate the site. Each area uses its own navigational buttons, links, and menus. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's, Reuters, BigCharts, Briefing.com, and Baseline -are delivered in frames, each with its own menu of options and system of navigation. While there 's a lot to choose from, it 's a mix of the same free information you can find elsewhere on the Web, with some premium services tossed in. A centralized ticker lookup page would allow better access to these materials. Once we started trading, a couple of minutes passed before our stock purchase was confirmed-one of the slowest responses in our survey. We also found the site to be a bit sluggish even during a normal trading day, which made us wonder about its performance on days when the market is hectic. Suretrade 's bare-bones approach means it does n't stand on ceremony when it comes to customer service. The brokerage 's e-mail support is based on a software program called " the Brain, " which sends automated responses to questions. The answers we got from this " smart " software were laughably bad and consistently unreliable. On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, including the issuance of stock certificates. But that 's unlikely to convince most investors that Suretrade is a sure thing. Waterhouse RESEARCH ENGINE FOR CUSTOMER service, it 's hard to beat Waterhouse WebBroker. When you sign up, you get an account officer who provides personal attention when needed. This privilege costs, though. Waterhouse 's $12 minimum commission jumps to $45 when you place an order with an account officer. In other ways Waterhouse has a way to go to catch up with its online brethren, particularly when it comes to opening an account. You ca n't apply for an account online, and once your account is open, you still have to call to get a password before you can trade on the Web. We also had problems with the site itself We often got stuck trying to use the JavaScript drop-down menus, in which you select an item from a drop-down box and the appropriate page loads automatically before you can click on " Go. " When you enter the site 's Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the box at the top of the screen before selecting a report from S &P,; Briefing.com, or MarketGuide. If you do n't, you 'll get an obscure error message. Navigation style also varied by page, from a text menu of choices on the side of the browser window to graphic buttons at the bottom of the page. Despite the frustrating interface, it was easy to place an order. The site 's stock trading screen stepped us through the process, and the confirmation screen linked us right to the order-status area. Our order to buy was filled within 6o seconds. Waterhouse 's Standard &; Poor 's Stock Reports were the best research tools we saw. Other sites charge a dollar or two for each report, so having the library for free can save money. One thing we could n't find was a copy of the account agreement, and it was n't for lack of trying. Guess we could have used that pricey personal account officer after all.
