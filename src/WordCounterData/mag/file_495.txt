4104941 In-depth responses to questions you could only ask Cosmo <p> Q. I 'm dating a new guy. What 's the secret to making the first time we have sex together less awkward and more pleasurable? <p> A. Foreplay. And lots of it. If you spend plenty of time teasing each other, you 'll discover what you both like in bed, so you 'll be in sync. You can clue him in to what turns you on before the main event -- whether you prefer light or rough strokes, a fast or slow pace, to be on top or have him take the lead, and so on. Pay attention to the same info about him as well. If his breathing becomes more rapid, his face becomes flushed, or his muscles tense up, then those are all signs that he 's into what you 're doing. <p> Plus, the longer you stroke, lick, etc., each other, the more aroused you 'll both become. That way, when you finally go for it, your brain will be flooded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement -- it 'll go into pleasure mode automatically... so you 'll do less thinking( e.g., " I wonder if he likes this? ") and more OMGing. <p> Q. How can I keep from leaking so much after sex? <p> A. First of all, it 's totally normal( and unavoidable) for his ejaculate to drip out of your vagina. In fact, the trickle effect can continue for up to 24 hours postsex. If it really bothers you, make a point to go to the bathroom immediately after you 're done. When you pee, most of his stuff will be flushed out due to gravity, so you 'll leak less. If you feel like you still need extra backup, you can also wear a panty liner to protect your underwear from any wetness. <p> One( very important) disclaimer : Ditch the condoms only if you are in a monogamous relationship and know for sure that your guy has been recently tested and is STD-free -- otherwise, you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted to have sex on the stairs. What 's the hottest( and most comfortable) position to try? <p> A. Definitely doggie-style. The incline lets him enter you at an upward angle, so he has direct access to your G-spot. Start by getting on all fours, with your knees on one step and your hands resting on the one above it, and ask your guy to kneel on the step below you so your bodies are meshed together tightly. If this hurts your knees, you can do the same thing standing -- brace your arms a few steps higher so you do n't have to bend down as far. Just make sure he does n't thrust too hard or you may lose your balance. <p> For an extra shot of pleasure, keep one hand on the step for balance and use the other to stimulate your clitoris at the same time. <p> Q. I have read that flexing my PC muscles during sex will improve my orgasm and feel good for my guy too. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will I be able to feel it when he 's inside me? <p> A. Yep, it works both ways. Two to three inches of your guy 's penis is actually rooted in his pelvic-floor muscles, so when he contracts them, his erection becomes even stronger.( In a study of men with erectile dysfunction, 40 percent were able to overcome the disorder by doing Kegels.) As a result, you get that pleasurable " filled up " sensation, and his harder erection is more likely to hit all your hot spots. <p> It 's also possible that you 'll feel the pulsing motion as he squeezes. To really take advantage, you 'll want to contract your pelvic muscles around his penis at the same time. You 'll experience the tingly feeling of activating your own Kegels plus the throbbing sensation of his, which means you get double the pleasure. <p> MEET THE SEX DOC <p> Yvonne K.
