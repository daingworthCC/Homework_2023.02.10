2114941 YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN there a few weeks ago when Steve Forbes held one of his campaign bashes at New York City 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Joan Rivers emceed. The $1,000-a-plate tables were flush with interested parties like Alan( " Ace ") Greenberg, head of the prominent investment firm Bear Stearns, and Leonard Lauder of the Estee Lauder cosmetics family. More than 1,400 people attended, which meant about $1.2 million for the campaign treasury. It was a big night for Forbes, his most successful fund raiser yet. His most successful what? To avoid becoming obligated to special interests, was n't Forbes supposed to be financing his own campaign? Not quite. He 's held at least one other sizable fund raiser so far. Half a dozen others are scheduled, and as many as 15 more are being planned. His campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, says Forbes is raising money to demonstrate that he has " a broad-based campaign. " And by law his donors are limited to $1,000 a person, which is not the kind of money that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' business-world friends, including Greenberg, Lauder and Philadelphia developer Richard Fox, have served as shakers of the donor tree, persuading others to chip in. While they deny seeking personal gain, if Forbes wins, they still might hope for special treatment from his White House.( Or if he loses, from his magazine.) Charles Lewis, author of The Buying of the President, sees it this way : " Forbes is a millionaire who says he 's not beholden to special interests who is now beholden to special interests. " What 's more, the money chase could serve Forbes in a highly personal way. Unlike Ross Perot, Forbes is not giving his own money to his campaign. He 's lending it -- with the option to repay himself later from any donor funds that remain unspent at the end of his campaign. If he gains the White House, he can also legally undertake postelection fund raising until he completely pays back his IOUs to himself. Though he says they have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Forbes would do it, pay himself back. " In the meantime, by fronting himself with his own money, the thrifty Forbes can afford to decline federal matching funds, which most of his Republican rivals ca n't do without but which saddle them with campaign-spending limits that Forbes can ignore. Let 's concede that it 's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. When it comes to entering the White House, wealth still has its advantages. So many, in fact, that American politics has become a rich person 's game as never before. In addition to Forbes, the ' 96 G.O.P. presidential field includes Morry Taylor, a multimillionaire tire manufacturer. And billionaire Ross Perot may run again. With serious presidential contenders needing $20 million for the primaries alone, a candidate 's most reliable friend, Phil Gramm once quipped, is " ready money. " And there ' s none readier than what 's in your own checkbook. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perot shelled out more than $60 million.
