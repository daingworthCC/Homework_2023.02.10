4148841 GLOSSARY # Creating a plasma that 's 10 times hotter than the sun 's core--necessary if we are to realize the dream of fusion power--requires a serious containment system. Otherwise, dangerous levels of heat and radiation can escape from the reactor 's core. To prevent that, scientists at ITER, the international nuclear power project, designed a protective barrier. The shield will line the inside of a reactor to hold in heat, radiation, and electromagnetic forces. That requires a specialized alloy, actively cooled by water pipes and protected by 440 4-ton modules with inner walls of radiation-resistant beryllium. Fabrication begins at the end of 2013 and should be completed by 2021. #
