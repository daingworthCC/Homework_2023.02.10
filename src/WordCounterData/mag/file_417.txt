4050641 With our work getting more and more intense as our first TV series, The Painted House, took off and started to get sold around the world, life was hectic. We were suddenly dealing with TV stations from China to South America and the show was being dubbed into many languages, often with hilarious results. My husband, Hans, and I had to learn to juggle-quickly. But it was never easy, especially with two boys who never seemed to sit still. In fact, for most of his life, Josh could barely walk across a room without falling. If there happened to be a bowl of pasta near him, it would end up on the floor. He 's broken every window in the house-either with a ball or by going through it himself. He does n't mean to do these things, he 's just the clumsiest child. His knees are permanently scarred ; the number of bones he 's broken must be in the record books. It 's certainly in the records at our local emergency department, where we 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been polite and likeable, which somehow diffuses the drama. " Sorry to bother you, Mum, " he 'll say, calling from the phone in the library. " I slipped in the park and my foot is all floppy. " " Mum? My finger seems to be sticking out in the weirdest direction, " he 'll mention quietly in the middle of dinner. In the early days of The Painted House, we were shooting a promotional piece for PBS, and all the stuffy executives had come in from Boston to make sure I did it right. We could n't afford a studio, so we filmed it in one of the children 's bedrooms. Josh and his brother, Max, who were then in elementary school, had actually become quite used to arriving home and finding the walls in their rooms had gone from looking like a painted meadow to resembling a panel of denim. But I was still new to hosting and quite nervous around these big executives. I told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave at me to say hi, but were then to go immediately to the basement and be quiet.( Well, a girl can dream....) There I was, cameras rolling, smiling wonderfully and painting the walls in some fancy finish, when I saw Josh gesturing to me in the doorway behind a sea of big execs. I was furious. He was doing this crazy pantomime, his hands in the air, as I tried my hardest to ignore him. " I 've broken my thumb playing basketball, " he mouthed. " What should I do? " Without missing a beat or a brush stroke, smile still plastered on my face, I said, " Get the bus to emergency. I 'll follow later. " I completely forgot about him in the chaos of the day( Mother of the Year, I know!), but Hans was called by the hospital half an hour later. " Uh, sir, we have a boy here who says you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " If that sort of thing happened to someone on one of my sets now, I 'd just say, " No problem, we 'll take a coffee break while you sort it out. " But when you 're just starting out in a business, it 's hard to make that call. You think those bigwigs are just going to drop you because your kid needs your attention for a second. I still think of those years as the age of accidents. I would come home at night and brace myself to hear who had been hurt, which kid had punched the other and how our poor house had suffered in the process. It was a difficult time-one of the hardest. It reached a peak one evening when Hans announced he would rather I did n't bombard him with all the family mess as soon as he walked in the door.( Hans ran what I think of as all the boring stuff at our company-like legal contracts, payroll and banking.) He needed time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, like the calm before a big storm. Then the hurricane hit. When the dust had settled and the furniture had been pushed back into place, he agreed he 'd never say that again! I needed time to decompress, too. Some days I 'd come in the house and go directly to the sink and start peeling potatoes. It did n't matter that no one wanted them. It was my chance to move from my work life into being a mum. All this bedlam would be happening around me and I would just zone out on my potatoes. It can be incredibly hard to juggle all the different parts of your life. When things get really insane at work and home, I have a tendency to panic. Going around with a thousand problems in my head, the pressure of our employees ' livelihoods resting on my shoulders, I 'm not surprised that I can never find the car keys or remember how to work the bloody remote, and insult the dishwasher repair-man for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did " my nose, but the truth is my up-tilted snoot is not the result of surgery, it 's from constantly rubbing my hand up my face in desperation. Luckily, Hans always( well, nearly always) stays calm. He 's the kind of man who has the boys ' lunches made and packed by eight in the morning, and leaves the kitchen spotless after a chaotic evening at home. I 'm slumped in an armchair with a bottle of something strong, while he 's loading the dishwasher, humming, a towel hung jauntily over his shoulder. The only problem is that being so calm, he 's a terrible person to argue with. He simply wo n't fight back. Still, over 20 years we 've had a handful of doozies, and it 's guaranteed that the kids remember every one in gory detail-lest we forget. The argument the boys most love to dredge up and remind me about occurred when I threw a cup at Hans 's head. It bounced off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most beautiful colour wash. I was furious. The wall was impossible to repair without looking as if it had been patched. I did n't care if their father had a giant goose egg on his forehead, he 'd ruined my paint finish! The trick to managing through all this chaos is having that core line of love. Of course, we 're all constantly flipping on either side of the line.( When Hans was away recently, I missed him like a lovesick teenager. He knew better, and said, " Wait until I get home, you 'll want to be rid of me. " He was right, of course.) Family life is like the tail of a fish flapping around-you adore them one minute, you want to run screaming from them the next, but love is the constant. There were days when I was producing and hosting and running an ever-expanding office that I felt completely overloaded. Life was much too much. I would stop in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute before. At home it felt as if I was in a domestic pressure cooker. But then suddenly it clicked. All the problems and questions I had to deal with are what life 's all about. I was n't going to arrive one day at some perfect moment when everything would be just right. I will always be working at it, finding solutions that make sense in that hour, in that day, that week. But there will always be solutions-and when you find one( even when it 's a little thing like getting your eight-year-old to make his bed without asking a billion times), you feel creative and strong. The problem might still be there( and it will likely rear its ugly head again) but the intensity has abated. Of course I 'm not talking about big answers, all-encompassing solutions, and I 'm not referring here to people who are struggling with poverty or divorce, illness or the death of someone they love, because that 's a different story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing through working and raising a family, dealing with the many ups and downs, problems are just part of living. You might even find the solution is in changing your own attitude : having a rest, talking to a friend, spending some time on your own. Mothers tend to believe that the world is going to stop if they take a break or let down their guard for a minute-even if they just ask for help. So many of us have been brought up by generations of women who put themselves last. My own mother died the year her last child left home. She was never able to enjoy her grandchildren or let us look after her. She rarely took the time to eat properly, never exercised( except for running after us) and certainly never had the luxury of time to herself.( I like to imagine her reaction to a modern yoga class. " Thank yourself for taking the time to focus on your breath "? She would have roared with laughter. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on par with the other most important aspects of your life : your children, your marriage and your work. Women who forget to pay attention to their own needs either snap or end up on the other end of parenting -the empty nest-with nothing in common with their husbands and no recollection of the qualities that made them passionate before all those poopy diapers and scraped knees. It 's not selfish to look after yourself, it 's imperative. My friend Christine, a busy real estate agent and mother of three, was so frazzled and exhausted recently that she stole away for the afternoon and treated herself to a massage and pedicure at a cushy spa. She was sitting in the lounge, bussed out, wearing her big fluffy white robe, drinking herbal tea, when she spotted her cleaning lady, also the mother of two, in her fluffy robe relaxing in a chair nearby. They laughed and had a glass of wine together. Two tired mums. Everyone needs a break sometimes. It 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
