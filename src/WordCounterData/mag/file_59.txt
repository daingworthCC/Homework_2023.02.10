2007341 From the cooktop to the table, sauteing shortens your time in the kitchen. // Saute is one of my favorite techniques-it 's energetic, cooks supper in less than 30 minutes, and lends itself to creative flavor combinations. The term " saute " means to quickly cook food in a small amount of fat in a hot pan, and it is surprisingly easy. If you 've cooked onions in oil or butter to put in a casserole, you 've got saute experience. This method is frequently used to cook chopped vegetables, but it also applies to cooking thin, tender cuts of meat and seafood such as boneless pork chops, chicken breasts, or fish fillets. When the directions say to saute onions, for example, we want you to stir constantly while cooking. When preparing meat, the food is usually turned once I saute frequently-for myself and for company, and definitely for the sheer fun of hearing that first sizzle as the food goes into the hot oil. When sauteing, watch and listen for cooking clues that tell you when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 176 for an explanation of these prompts.) After you finish a meat or seafood sauce, you can make a great sauce from the browned bits in the skillet. Just add a liquid, such as wine or broth, to loosen the bits-this is called deglazing the pan. Then boil briefly to reduce, or thicken, the sauce. Great sautes start with a great skillet, so turn to " From Our Kitchen " on page 186 for hints on the perfect pan. Then follow our step-by-step directions to get the hang of this terrific timesaving cooking technique. SPICY CATFISH WITH VEGETABLES AND BASIL CREAM MAKES 4 SERVINGS PREP : 25 MIN., COOK : 25 MIN.

This recipe cooks the steaks to medium-rare doneness. Lower the temperature and increase cook time for more well-done steaks. // SIX STEPS TO SAUTE SUCCESS 1. Get Off to a Hot Start To saute in a small amount of fat means about 1/8 inch of fat. Butter adds great flavor, but it has a low smoke point, meaning it burns quickly. So when the milk solids( the white foam you see) just start to brown, add the food. Do n't substitute margarine for butter ; because margarine contains water, it will steam the food rather than fry it. A great solution is to use vegetable oil and butter for heat control plus flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can withstand high cooking temperatures. Olive oils labeled " virgin " or " pure " also hold up to heat. Extra virgin olive oil tends to burn quickly. When the oil in a hot pan shimmers, it 's time to add the food. 2. Take Your Time When food is added, the skillet and oil temperatures fall. Add ingredients gradually, so you hear a constant sizzling sound. We 've all seen pros using some fancy wrist action to flip the food in the skillet without using a utensil. It 's dramatic ; however, the skillet cools when taken off the heat, and the food cools when tossed in the air. 3. Beautifully Browned For a crispy, browned crust, lightly dust meat or fish with flour, breadcrumbs, or cornmeal just before adding to the hot skillet. To saute without breading, pat juicy meats, poultry, or seafood dry with paper towels( excess liquid will cause the oil to pop). Season with salt, pepper, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add the first piece of fish or meat, pretty side down( skin side up on fish) with the thickest portion in first.You 'll hear a fast sizzle that will slow as the temperature drops. Bubbles of oil or butter will form all around the food. As the temperature rises, the sizzle increases. Add the next fillet( leave 1 inch of space around each-a crowded skillet steams rather than crisps). Expect splatters on the cooktop when the temperature is correct. 5. Time to Turn When the fillets look done around the top of the sides, it 's time to turn. Give the pan a shake. Food should release and slide when it 's ready to turn. Flip it with tongs or a spatula, and continue to cook until done. Then remove it from the skillet. If the food does n't release easily, you skimped on the oil or the pan was n't hot enough. 6. Capture All the Flavor Add a liquid such as whipping cream, wine, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of coating from the bottom of the skillet. For a stronger flavor, boil the added liquid until the volume reduces by half. Add delicate herbs lust before serving for fullest flavor.
