2024541 Section : A FIELD <p> Carrots for the energy industry : That 's the core of George Bush 's advice this summer as legislators in both houses of Congress try to concoct a national energy policy. Leasing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas development is essential, Bush says ; so is increased production of natural gas and nuclear power. Energy efficiency? For Bush, it 's a topic hardly worth mentioning. <p> Free-market principles are said to be an integral part of Bush 's energy creed. But he 's a pragmatist at heart, shedding his laissez-faire mantle when pushing for subsidies to the energy industry, and donning it again when confronted with talk of new regulations, taxes, and import fees. " Too heavy-handed, " he declares these traditional policy tools. <p> In his National Energy Strategy released in late February, Bush showcased a long list of industry-friendly measures that he said would ensure a " secure, efficient, and environmentally sound " energy future. This latter claim spurred Richard Heede and Robert Bishop to fire up their computers. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's premier energy-efficiency think tank, rigorously examined one key section of Bush 's National Energy Strategy -- its controversial oil provisions. Their aim was to get beyond the document 's promises and ideology by comparing it with an alternative energy policy based on efficiency. They gave Bush 's high oil-production goals a reality check, and then compared both plane ' prow able effects on the cost, consumption, and import of oil over the next 20 years. <p> Did the researchers conclude that the Bush strategy would make our energy future more secure, as advertised? " For some people it will, " they say, " but only if they happen to run oil companies. " -- the editors THE EFFICIENCY SCENARIO <p> In preparing an alternative oil policy fired by efficiency gains rather than by drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, we first examined the transportation sector, which consumes about two-thirds of the oil used in the United States. We assumed that, on average, new automobiles would increase their fuel economy by 2 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2000 and 65 mpg by 2010 -- a conservative goal that can be met with existing, cost-effective technology. We posited that the efficiency of other forms of transportation -- planes, buses, trucks, and so forth -- would improve at the same rate, a goal also achievable with technology that is now readily available. <p> Our strategy ignored belt-tightening options : We assumed that no cutbacks would be required either in the number of cars or in the miles that we drive them. Instead, we figured that these factors would increase at the present rate. <p> Finally, we assumed that the amount of oil put to other uses -- 33 percent goes for home heating, industrial boilers, asphalt, and petrochemicals -- would decline at 5 percent a year, as it did for much of the 1980s due to efficiency gains. <p> Figure 1 shows :( A) the nation 's existing extraction rate, which is declining by 4 percent a year ;( B) how little that extraction rate would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move that President Bush has called central to the nation 's energy security) ; and( C) the National Energy Strategy 's projection -- more precisely, its quantified hope -- that increased subsidies to the oil industry could boost that rate by 20 percent, from 8.8 to 10.6 million barrels a day by 2010. <p> Why do the administration 's oil-rich dreams seem so unlikely to come true? The United States is the most densely drilled petroleum region in the world. Its oil-extraction rate has been gradually declining since 1985. More than half of the country 's 13 largest oil fields are four-fifths depleted. Delivering new supplies, whether by squeezing more oil from old wells or by finding and developing new ones, is becoming increasingly difficult -- even with subsidies. <p> Given these realities, we find the National Energy Strategy 's extraction goals geologically and economically improbable. By 2000 the country would be paying $185 billion a year for oil under Bush 's plan -- almost twice as much as it pays today. By 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency the cornerstone of our energy policy would send the curve in the other direction, offering savings instead of rapidly escalating costs. Neither curve includes environmental or security costs, both factors that would be far smaller in an energy-efficient economy. <p> " We know how to run the present U. S. economy on one-fifth the oil we are now using, " says energy expert and Rocky Mountain Institute founder Amory Lovins. The efficiency improvements Lovins is talking about would cut demand at a cost of about $5 per barrel of oil saved. The oil that Bush would wrest from Alaska would run three to seven times more per barrel, not even considering the devastation of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. <p> Our efficiency proposals offer compound benefits : Not only would we need less oil to do our work, what we did need would be cheaper. <p> Energy-efficiency gains made since 1973 are now saving the nation $100 billion per year. As Figure 2 shows, we could enjoy an even bigger financial reward in the future if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Bush 's scheme misses key opportunities for meeting our energy needs more efficiently -- by raising auto fuel-economy standards, for instance -- oil consumption would rise as shown in red. Our efficiency scenario, on the other hand, could reduce oil consumption significantly over the next ten years and keep demand level in the decade after that. <p> People who have doubts about whether substantially greater auto efficiency is possible should consider Volvo 's prototype LCP 2000. It seats four comfortably, is more crashworthy than federal standards require, accelerates faster than the average car today( from 0 to 60 in 11 seconds), and gets 81 highway miles to the gallon. To top it off, Volvo has devised a streamlined manufacturing process that would make the LCP 2000 no more costly than typical Volvos today. <p> Other models on the automakers ' drawing boards are similarly impressive : the General Motors TPC gets 61 mpg in the city and 74 on the highway ; the Renault Vesta 2, 78 in the city and 107 on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name but a few encouraging examples. Manufacturers are hesitant to market these fuel-efficient models, however, because U. S. consumers have little incentive to buy them ; gas is too cheap. <p> There 's no shortage of innovative thinking among the world 's auto designers -- just a failure by industry and government to put such thinking to work. As oil analyst Rob Watson of the Natural Resources Defense Council points out, " The right place to look for the biggest energy reserve is not the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Outer Continental Shelf, or Saudi Arabia. It 's time to drill in Detroit. " After having gone to war at least partly to protect its oil interests in the Persian Gulf, the United States might well be expected to make reducing imports one of its highest priorities. Yet the National Energy Strategy( shown in red) does nothing to reduce the national appetite for oil -- it merely suggests subsidizing domestic producers and using alternative fuels. Because these measures ca n't keep up with unbridled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting cost-effective energy efficiency measures to work, on the other hand, would reduce imports from almost 8 million barrels a day in 1991 to 6 million barrels a day in the year 2000( shown in purple). Along with this decrease in imports would come a welcome increase in national security. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : AN ENVIRONMENTALIST 'S GUIDE TO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION OIL POLICY <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Bush 's National Energy Strategy( NES) ca n't deliver on its biggest promise : to reverse a steady decline in domestic oil production. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : If the NES were edopted ; the nation 's energy bill would skyrocket. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : By ignoring waste, the NES would help increase our consumption of oil. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : The NES would make us increasingly dependent on oil from the Persian Gulf. <p> GRAPH : Figure 1.
