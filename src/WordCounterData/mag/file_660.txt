4148441 Section : People picks A DOZEN COOL THINGS TO SEE, HEAR, READ AND DOWNLOAD THIS WEEK # FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEWS OF MOVIES, TV SHOWS, MUSIC AND BOOKS, GO TO PEOPLE.COM/PICKS # BINGE ON THIS! # No. 1 Shark Week # It 's coming right at you! Discovery 's 28th annual shock-and-jaw marathon! # TV # NATURE # Given that the annual death rate from malaria is a half million people, Discovery should help us overcome our obsession with sharks by launching the more useful Mosquito Week. However, in this 40th-anniversary summer of Jaws, sharks are not about to relinquish their bite on the culture. Their hunger, their stealth and, of course, those teeth stir up a primal, monstrous dread. The specials that make up Shark Week hook you with a shivering tone of marvelin Ninja Sharks, the shortfin mako is summed up by one expert as " a rocket ship with gills and teeth " and the trivia is irresistible. As in : Sharks do n't usually expose their dorsal fins above the water 's surface, as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's something to chew on.( July 5-12) # No. 2 Amy # How a great talent faded to black # MOVIE # DOCUMENTARY # The wipeout that was singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse is the subject of this exceptional movie. Combining a wealth of archival and personal footage, it 's practically a moment-to-moment reckoning of her surging success and long tumble into addiction and ruin. Director Asif Kapadia could have spared us some of the more harrowing imagesby the end she looks like an abandoned building praying to be torchedbut Amy drives home just how immense a talent we lost. She was possibly the best songwriter of her generation, yet her career lasted a mere eight years.( July 3 in L.A. and New York City, R) # No. 3 Key &amp; Peele # TV # COMEDY # You can break down Key &amp; Peele into its human componentsKeegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peelebut in performance you ca n't tell where one leaves off and the other begins. They seem to thrive on cheerful, noncompetitive give-and-take. So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet about Ferguson, Mo.?( Comedy Central, July 8, 10 p.m.) # No. 4 Leon Bridges, Coming Home # MUSIC # SOUL # Like a time traveler from the early 1960s, Bridges, a 25-year-old Texan, has a retro R&amp;B vibe that will cool you off this summer. From his album 's cover art( Bridges looks like he just wrapped a Motown studio session) to his smooth vocals backed up by horns and a doo-wopping girl chorus, Home is a love letter to Sam Cooke and Otis Redding. Jukebox jams such as " Twistin ' &amp; Groovin " could have been hits 50 years ago. # No. 5 Jimmy 's Hall # An Irish hero has no choice but to face the music # MOVIE # DRAMA # " What is this craze for pleasure? " Father Sheridan, an unsmiling old priest on the lookout for communists and other agitators in an Irish town in 1932, puts that question to his congregation in this gentle, rich-hearted film. The chief fun-lover, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato, is one Jimmy Gralton : He runs a club where folks sway to jazz, recite poems by W.B. Yeats and find a release from sadness. Barry Ward 's Jimmy is devastatingly handsome, charming and forthright. But, life and Irish history being what they are, he gives more happiness than he gets.( July 3, PG-13) # No. 6 It Follows # DVD+STREAMING # HORROR # One of the year 's best-reviewed films, Follows has the weird but unshakable logic of a nightmare. A young girl in the Detroit suburbs learns that she has become cursed : She 'll be followed all over town by malevolent spirits whose aim is to kill her. Poky and slack-jawed, they 're nonetheless scarily persistent. The only way to escape the curse is by passing it onthrough sex. Do n't ever say millennials have it easy.( July 14) # No. 7 Selena Gomez feat. A$AP Rocky, ' Good for You ' # MUSIC # POP # At 22, Gomez has ditched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single. She sticks to her strengthsheart-throbbing lyrics, breathy vocalsas she coos about getting dolled up for her man. With this new song and last year 's " The Heart Wants What It Wants, " Gomez has hit her stride. Good for her. # No. 8 The Spoils Before Dying # All that jazz, and all that nonsensical humor # TV # COMEDY # This sequel to the dizzily stupid Spoils of Babylon is a fake-arty send-up of obscure American pulp movies, the sort that might be championed by French cineasts itching to rub our noses in our ignorance. Mostly it 's a fresh chance for Will Ferrell, looking like a bearded termite hill, to impersonate Orson Welles and for Kristen Wiig to whoop it up. She 's a has-been singer on the lam in the 1950s with a jazz musician( Boardwalk Empire 's Michael Kenneth Williams). For some reason she makes a banana-chocolate cake using motor oil instead of chocolate.( IFC, July 8, 9 p.m.) # No. 9 Janet Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has n't released a new album since 2008, but her latest song( off her upcoming LP) was worth the wait. Over organ riffs and synths, Janet promises a long-distance lover an erotic reunion free of " sleeep. " That third " e " is only right for such a steeamy, dreeamy comeback. # No. 10 Cody Simpson, Free # MUSIC # POP # The 18-year-old Simpson is n't about to be held back by his early success as a teen idol. The mighty John Mayer, who served as a sounding board on this self-released project, surely influenced the thoughtful lyricism and expert guitar work. But Simpson 's Australian roots shine through too : Free is a breezy, reggae-tinged set of hopeful ditties( " Livin ' Easy, " " Flower ") that feel as if they were recorded on the beach. # No. 11 Dates # TV # DRAMA # Understated to the point of slight chilliness, this British import about online hookups and misfires is quite a change for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows about the sexy and the star-crossed had left town for the Hamptons. Not a bad thing : In the premiere, Game of Thrones ' Oona Chaplin, who looks like a more pensive Jennifer Love Hewitt, plays a young woman whose confidence in her sexual charisma is challenged by a lug of a lorry driver. Their encounter may not be as brief as you 'd expect.( CW, July 9, 9 p.m.) # No. 12 The Best New Books # A stirring tale of wilderness survival, a choose-your-ending love story and a novel steeped in the ' 60s space race # Taylor Jenkins Reid Maybe in Another Life # NOVEL # Tired of meaningless jobs and fresh from a breakup, 29-year-old Hannah goes home to L.A. seeking a new start. What she encounters first is her old boyfriend Ethan in a bar. Is it fate? Should she stay with him or leave with her friend? In parallel story lines, Reid plays out the consequences of each decision. It 's not a spoiler to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot # NOVEL # Johncock 's debut novel about the 1960s space race transports readers to a time of Scotch-soaked bars, Walter Cronkite on the news and astronauts as superheroes. Test pilot Jim Harrison wants to be one of them, but his calling exacts a price, especially after personal tragedy strikes. Ingeniously plotted, deftly written and engrossing. # BOOK OF THE WEEK # Lori Lansens Mountain Story # NOVEL # In Lansens 's heart-stoppingly suspenseful tale, four strangers struggle together to survive after getting lost in the Southern California mountains.
