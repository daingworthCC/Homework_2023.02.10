2008841 // From the first day we don cycling gloves, we are hysterically warned against it by well-meaning friends, experts and advertisements for sports drinks and energy bars, and we dread it until it comes( feeling smart or lucky because it has n't), and then after it does, we regret it and add our story to the totem of misery and warning. It never gets any easier or less painful, or shows you any more respect-no matter how long you have been riding-and it always, inevitably, comes again to remind you of all that. It hurts deep, bonking does. It hurts not just externally like a broken collarbone, and not just internally like hunger, but like both at once. Bonking empties us. It steals energy from our muscles and organs, and thought from our brains. It destroys sensation and control. It ruins you for days after it hobbles you beside a road or strikes you down in the woods. And is n't it great? Let us praise the disgusting, no-good, low-down, despicable bonk. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad. " Alfred Hiltbrunner 's pale blue eyes are hard and sharp with the memory of a desolate stretch of road near the Alps. He sees himself splayed there. When he was in his early 20s, Hiltbrunner and a friend lost all their money gambling in Italy and had to ride home to Switzerland fueled by nothing but berries, grass and water. On a 150-mile leg, they bonked. Hiltbrunner fell off his bike. Could n't move. Only serendipity worthy of a movie saved him-a friend happened to drive by on a scooter. Later, when Hiltbrunner raced as a member of the Swiss national team, that bonk would play through his mind. " Everyone trained, even the same or better than me, " he remembers 38 years later. " But there were times when I was racing and just about dead, and I 'd look at the guy next to me and I knew that he was tired, too. I pressed on and that killed ' em. I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when I was dead. Because I survived that road to Zurich, I am stronger mentally. " Bonking, says clinical psychologist Andrew Meyers, " is like nuclear power. it can light a whole city or poison the core of the earth. " Or it can do both. Riders who have not yet experienced what English cyclists call " the knock " possess unlimited potential ; they do n't know that they 're no better than the container of their bodies. Bonking caps your potential and seals it with a label that reads : " Know your limits. " Kirk Waymire, a hulking 6-foot-4, 31 -year-old construction worker, was three months into his weekend warrior riding career. He 'd knocked out 30-mile rides and had an unshakable belief in his own invincibility on the day he set out for an 80-miler along the Pacific Coast Highway and Laguna Canyon in California. His only onboard fuel : one-water bottle. About 60 miles into the ride, the beautiful sunny California day collapsed into a 15-foot tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same odd fascination with which people watch Fox TV " reality " specials, passengers in cars craned their necks to stare at Waymire 's ashen face. At a stoplight, a woman leaned out of her car and asked the drained cyclist if he was okay. He nodded and kept chopping homeward. " I dreaded stoplights, because it took more energy to unclip and get going again than to just keep going, " he says. Waymire hit his limit. He bonked. But he saw salvation in a roadside burrito stand. Concentrating on forcing the words from his mouth, he asked for a burrito. " I sounded like I was drunk or something, " Waymire says, vividly remembering how he struggled just to make his mouth move. " They looked at me like I was crazy. " He had n't packed any money, so he offered his bike in exchange for tortillas. No swap( it was against burrito-stand policy), so he stumbled on. As he passed a lifeguard station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars, then pointed him to a phone booth to call his wife. " My body had never felt that bad before. I 'm not the type to quit, but I could n't go anymore. Took all I had to walk and muster enough energy to call my wife. " // On the phone, he slurred an assurance to his wife that he had n't been in an accident and said, " I 've heard of a bonk, and this is what I think happened to me. " He stretched out on a patch of grass to wait for her. His brain swirled. He knew that if he lost consciousness he 'd be taken to the hospital. He wished his bike would have bought him a burrito. Mercifully, his wife pulled up. Waymire has never done another onebottle, long ride into the unknown. He prepares with carbs, protein and plenty of liquids. But, he says, his bonk taught him more about himself than nutrition. " If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says. " The bonk gave me a lot of respect for the unknown. I thought I was invincible, that an 80-mile ride was no big deal, that I could just take it easy and pedal slow when I got tired. But even easy does n't work when you bonk. When it 's over, it 's over. Bonking made me realize I 'm just another human being. " And, echoing Hiltbrunner 's Swiss Alps epiphany, Waymire recalls how hitting bottom helped him when he went on to race the Hawaiian Ironman. " About four or five times I thought I just could n't go on. But I thought about that bonk, and I got some extra strength when I turned inward to myself. " We do n't suggest that you set out to bonk as a learning experience. " That would just be masochistic, " says Edmund Burke, a sports physiologist and the director of the Exercise Science Program at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxins. " The total-body depletion French riders call fringale deserves its nefarious reputation. The physical strain can trash a training schedule or hospitalize a rider for dehydration or exhaustion. But some pro riders and coaches muse that there might be a physical benefit to bonking. // Years before he became the mutton-chopped guru of mountain biking, Bob Roll woke up in a ditch thinking he was a koala bear. " Man, I was suffering, " says Roll, the memory still as bright as the sun that blasted him through the canopy of eucalyptus leaves in Marin County, California. " Bonking is a singular and particular sensation. It 's not fatigue. You can be totally fine then, POW! It can happen in 20 pedal strokes. You 're on top of the world, then comatose It 's an exercise-induced lobotomy. " But, he says, " Some of my best races have been after bonks. It 's a way to make the body learn to burn its reserves efficiently. When you bonk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels good to go through total degradation and let the body rebuild itself. " Chris Carmichael, Lance Armstrong 's coach and founder of Carmichael Training Systems, does n't recommend bonking as a training tool. But he does say " there can be a rebound effect. " A bonk might squeeze your body like a sponge. " When you dunk a dry sponge in water, " says Lisa Dorfman, a sports nutritionist, former professional triathlete and author of The Vegetarian SPorts Nutrition Guide, " it does n't soak up a lot. The next time, it gets more. " Tom Miller, an 18-year-old expert cross-country racer, bonked in the ' 98 Red Wing, Minnesota, NORBA race. On the far end of the last lap he crawled through the mud, sifting for opened Gu packets discarded by the racers who had already crossed the finish line. On the verge of unconsciousness, he squeezed what he could find into his mouth. Mud freely mingled with the sticky gel. He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says. " It felt like I was on the brink of death. " During the off-season, Miller concentrated on strength training and nutrition. This year he won the junior Olympics nationals in Red Wing. " That bonk was a turning point for me, " he says. When a Kansa brave was sent away from the tribe on a vision quest, he was not given food, water or much else for survival. If the spirits were with him, he would see visions that would guide him the rest of his life. The slightly unromantic reality : He bonked. // As glycogen, the body 's energy chemical, gets squeezed off from the brain, " you get to a point beyond the rational, and then you can interpret things differently, " says the University of Memphis 's psychologist Meyers, who also consults with the U.S. Olympic committee. " It could be compared to a religious experience -- or to drugs. " We 're a long way from spirit animals and visions. America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeties and catch-alls. There are support groups and self-help books. Credit cards and tate-payment arrangements, no-fault divorce and easy bankruptcy. It is a luxurious time. We do not look at the sky from a dustbowl depression and pray for rain. When you bonk, you are taken to a place most well-fed, TV-watching Americans don't- go-, The bottom. What if, when you hit the bottom you do n't find a void? What if you find a resilience? Instead of emptiness, the will to ride again? Bonking caps your potential, but frees your ability to endure. Bonks heighten and alter senses. Food tastes delicious after a bonk. The primal hunger may be the closest a man can get to understanding a pregnancy craving. Bonks have linked people to times and places of their past, or let them see things that never existed. Riders have reported yellow lines rising up from the road to strike them.
