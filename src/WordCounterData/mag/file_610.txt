4142641 WILLIAM MARSHAL # William Marshal, warrior and tutor-in-arms to the son of Henry II and Eleanor of Acquitaine, promised his dying charge that he would complete the sacred task of crusading to the Levant. Did he succeed in his mission and fight the forces of Saladin, asks Thomas Asbridge? # ONE OF ENGLAND 'S FINEST warriors was laid to rest in London 's Temple Church on May 20th, 1219. In his funeral oration that day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, reportedly described this celebrated veteran of countless wars -- William Marshal -- as ' the greatest knight in the world '. The youngest son of a minor Anglo-Norman noble, Marshal had risen through the ranks to serve at the right hand of five English monarchs. He became a revered tournament champion, esteemed by his peers as the paragon of chivalry and a powerful landed baron of the realm. # Having been on intimate terms with figures such as Eleanor of Acquitaine, Richard the Lionheart and ' Bad ' King John, Marshal was ultimately appointed as regent for the boy-king Henry III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully stemmed the tide of a major French invasion and baronial revolt in 1217, at the Battle of Lincoln, saving the Angevin( or Plantagenet) dynasty from utter annihilation. Though Marshal is far from a household name today, this remarkable career marks the knight out as one of the most compelling, extraordinary and intriguing figures of the Middle Ages. # Marshal was also the subject of the first known contemporary biography of a medieval knight, the so-called History of William Marshal, written some six years after his death on the orders of his eldest son and now surviving in a single manuscript held in New York 's Morgan Library. This work serves as the key source for Marshal 's life, though inevitably it offers a highly partisan account of his achievements. However, the biography has sparked an enduring mystery about one particular phase of its hero 's career : the time he spent on crusade in the Holy Land. # While still in his early twenties, Marshal was appointed as tutor-in-arms to Henry II and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the course of the next 13 years the pair became close associates, achieving renown on the tournament fields of northern France ; but they were also embroiled in two abortive rebellions against Henry II 's overbearing authority. In the midst of the second of these civil wars, in June 1183, Young Henry contracted dysentery and suffered a squalid and agonising death in Acquitaine. As he lay dying, Young Henry charged his friend and confidante with a sacred task. Some months earlier, the Angevin heir had made a commitment to lead a crusade to the Levant( modem Lebanon, Syria and Palestine) and he now begged his ' dearest friend ', Marshal, to fulfil that vow in his stead, carrying the cloak upon which Henry had affixed his cloth crusader 's cross all the way to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. # Honouring Young Henry 's request was no simple matter ; it involved a challenging journey of more than z, 000 miles, almost to the edge of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of service, nonetheless. The best estimates suggest that Marshal set out from western Europe in the autumn of 1183 and probably returned either in late 1185 or early 1186. This places him in the Near East at the precise moment when a titanic struggle was brewing between the Latin Christian crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the emerging might of the great Muslim sultan, Saladin. Not surprisingly, the notion of one of the foremost warriors of the Middle Ages arriving in such a contested battleground has sparked both scholarly and popular imaginations. # Over the last century, the leading historians of Marshal 's career - from Sidney Painter to Georges Duby and David Crouch -- have all struggled to interpret or to explain his short-lived crusading career. This was largely because the History of William Marshal offered only a brief and frustratingly evasive comment upon the period that its chief protagonist spent in the Holy Land. The History recorded that William performed ' many feats of bravery and valour ' during his stay, achieving as much as ' if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these ' fine deeds ' were ' still known about today ' and widely discussed. But Marshal 's biographer then declared that he could not describe these marvellous exploits because : ' I was not there and did not witness them, nor can I find anyone who can tell me half of them ' # AS A RESULT, MOST HISTORIANS have been content simply to pass over William 's time in the East in a few sentences. Painter, for example, argued that, as ' a crusade was the supreme adventure ', William ' undoubtedly performed great deeds against the forces of the redoubtable Saladin '. More recently, Crouch suggested that, while ' a cynic might conclude ' from the History 's relative silence that Marshal ' had done very little ' in Palestine, ' this would be unjust '. Crouch also stated that ' by no stretch of the imagination could William 's crusading pilgrimage be interpreted as a career move '. # It is true that, beyond the brief account offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actions in the Holy Land. His visit was not recorded by any Levantine chronicler, nor did he appear in any official surviving documentation, such as charters issued in the Latin East. Even so, considerably more can be deduced about the nature, progress and impact of Marshal 's crusade than has been previously indicated. # WILLIAM MARSHAL 'S CRUSADING pilgrimage seems, first and foremost, to have been driven by selfless dedication and authentic religious devotion. With Young Henry defeated and dead, there was little advantage to be gained from upholding his memory. Had William 's first priority been to secure his future, he would have focused on finding a new post in a military retinue ; instead, he made a firm commitment to travel to the Near East by taking the crusaders ' cross himself. In many respects, this was a step away from royal service and an interruption to his career ; one that prevented him from seeking personal advancement. # This is not to suggest that William was simply the saintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City. He was willing to make some sacrifices in 1183, but he was also a realist. Once Young Henry had been laid to rest in Rouen Cathedral, Marshal sought an audience with Henry II. The Angevin king evidently knew that his eldest son had charged Marshal with a crusading obligation before his death and seems to have respected William 's fidelity, while also recognising his martial renown. As a result, Henry II promised to hold a place for Marshal in the royal household, probably in response to his request for such a guarantee. # Marshal had laid the groundwork for a prosperous future in western Europe should he return from the Levant, but in spite of the king 's commitment, Marshal seems to have considered the possibility that he might remain in the Holy Land. In midsummer 1183 he travelled back to England, taking ' leave of his friends, his sisters, his immediate family and all his other kinsmen ', in the words of the History. The journey to England was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man placing his affairs in order ahead of a prolonged, perhaps even permanent, absence. # Many knights of William 's age, background and station had forged new careers in the Levant. For much of the nth century the crusader states established after the Latin Christian conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 offered manifold opportunities for men of Marshal 's class. By travelling to defend the Holy Places, knights could do ' God 's work ' and at the same time find advancement, even lands of their own. The Burgundian knight Reynald of Chatillon was a case in point. He had fought on the Second Crusade in the contingent of Louis VII of France in his mid-twenties, but remained in the East. In spite of being a relative unknown, Reynald married Constance of Antioch, heiress to the northern crusader state, in 1153 and ruled as prince of Antioch for eight years. Captured by Muslims, he spent 15 years in prison in Aleppo before being ransomed. By the time he was freed, Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared, but Reynald soon secured another advantageous union, this time with the heiress of the great desert lordship of Transjordan. This brought him command of the fortresses of Kerak and Montreal and put him in the frontline of the holy war with Saladin. # Another knight who made his fortune in the East was Guy of Lusignan, one of two brothers who had ambushed William Marshal and his maternal uncle, Earl Patrick of Salisbury, in Poitou in 1168. At some point in the 1170s Guy had travelled to Palestine, perhaps in part to atone for Patrick 's death, but like Reynald he achieved sudden advancement through marriage in 1180, wedding Sibylla of Jerusalem, the sister of Baldwin IV, the Leper King. In light of Baldwin 's ill health, Guy soon had his eyes on the crown of Jerusalem itself : a staggering transformation of fortunes, given that just 15 years earlier he had been an Acquitainean outlaw on the run from Henry II. With such precedent, it would be surprising if William did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Certainly, the possibility of his crusade being, in part, a ' career move ' can not be wholly discounted. # Marshal probably arrived in Palestine at the thriving port of Acre -- a bustling, cosmopolitan hub of trade and commerce, which even welcomed Muslim merchants and travellers, in spite of the ongoing holy war -- having undertaken a four- to six-week sea voyage from a southern French port like Marseille. Given that Young Henry was buried in mid-July and that Marshal travelled to England first, the earliest probable date for his departure for the Levant was September 1183 and, in all probability, he set out before the Mediterranean sea lanes closed for winter in early November. # IT IS LIKELY THAT William 's priority was to complete his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, thereby fulfilling his promise to Young Henry. That journey brought him inland, through the Judean hills, to the Holy City itself : a great, walled metropolis and the epicentre of the Christian faith. Marshal 's ultimate destination was the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the site of Christ 's death and resurrection. For William, like all medieval Latin Christians, this was the most sacred space on Earth. # One of the few additional details mentioned by the History was that, during his time in the East, Marshal became friendly with members of the two celebrated military orders : the Templars and the Hospitallers. These religious movements combined the ideals of knighthood and monasticism and their adherents were regarded as the ultimate holy warriors, forming the elite core of the Kingdom of Jerusalem 's armies. Given his own background and the martial renown he had garnered in western Europe, the association with these revered knightly orders was natural. According to the History, the Templars and Hospitallers ' loved the Marshal very dearly because of his many fine qualities ' and he must have been equally impressed by their legendary discipline and skill-at-arms. In Jerusalem itself he would surely have spent time in the Templar compound( now part of what is the Aqsa Mosque) on the Haram as-Sharif or Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rock transformed into the Latin Templum Domini, topped by a huge cross rather than a crescent. It is also likely that William visited the massive Hospital in Jerusalem, where up to 2,000 poor or sick Christians could be treated. # Beyond this probable reconstruction of Marshal 's initial movements in the Levant, what more can be inferred about his time in Palestine between the autumn of 1183 and early 1186? The History of William Marshal may tell us little, but by using an array of other contemporary sources, it is possible to establish a detailed account of the Kingdom of Jerusalem 's history in these precise years. This picture is revealing, because it demonstrates that Marshal arrived in a Latin realm that was on the brink of disaster and that the looming shadow of this catastrophe was obvious to all. More importantly, and perhaps surprisingly, in spite of the simmering tension with the Muslim world, Marshal happened to reach Palestine in a period of relative calm. # THE KINGDOM OF Jerusalem had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saladin had finally managed to overcome Muslim rivals in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. This gave the sultan control of an arc of territory running south to Damascus, then on to Egypt and the great city of Cairo, effectively surrounding the Kingdom of Jerusalem. However, his ambitious plan to unite the Muslim world remained incomplete, as he had yet to subdue the Iraqi city of Mosul, and Saladin was determined to assemble a grand coalition of Islamic forces before attempting a mass invasion of Latin Palestine. This meant that, although the sultan did prosecute two exploratory attacks on Christian territory in the autumn of 1183 and the summer of 1184, his real focus lay elsewhere. # It is just possible that Marshal saw almost immediate action in September 1183, after Saladin marched his forces into Galilee in the northern reaches of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. A large Latin army was assembled in response to this incursion and pilgrims waiting in Acre to sail back to Europe were even pressed into service. It may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second half of September, but it is perhaps doubtful that he reached the Levant so quickly. Baldwin 's illness meant that the Latin forces were commanded by Guy of Lusignan. Given that this was his first experience of leading a large field army, he did an admirable, if unspectacular job, advancing in close formation to threaten Saladin 's forces, yet staunchly refusing to be drawn into a hasty confrontation. Barring some limited skirmishing, there was no determined combat and, faced with a stalemate, Saladin withdrew. Thus, even if Marshal did participate in this campaign, he would hardly have been party to a monumental confrontation. # Saladin moved on that autumn to besiege Reynald of Chatillon 's massive desert castle at Kerak, on the route linking Damascus with Arabia and Egypt, and the sultan returned to attack the fortress for a second time in the summer of 1184. On both occasions, Latin armies marched to break the siege and it must be likely that William joined one or both of these expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultan retreated as soon as the Christians approached. In this period, Saladin moved with extreme caution, testing his enemy and building his own forces. There were no other notable campaigns in Palestine during Marshal 's time in the East. By the spring of 1185, Saladin was more interested in battering distant Mosul into submission and, to forestall a war on two fronts, he agreed a u-month truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The resultant lull in fighting dismayed newly arrived crusaders, including a party of frustrated European knights, who appeared in early 1186 only to be strictly forbidden from launching an attack on Muslim territory for fear of inciting reprisal. # THE ONLY OTHER military offensive in these years was a small, illegal raid conducted by Guy of Lusignan, probably at some point before early October 1184, against Bedouin nomads living near the fortress settlement of Darum( on the Kingdom of Jerusalem 's southern border with the Sinai). Bedouin often provided the Latins with valuable intelligence about Saladin 's movements and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy 's unsanctioned plundering expedition infuriated Baldwin. Given their past history in Poitou, it would be easy to imagine that Marshal still harboured considerable ill-feeling towards the Lusignan ' murderer ' of 1168. In fact, in his brief account of Marshal 's time in the Holy Land, the author of the History mentioned that his hero was on good terms with Guy, so it may be that William was party to this disreputable raid. # William had little opportunity to perform the ' many feats of bravery and valour ' alluded to in the History. In military terms, Marshal was disillusioned by his crusade ; certainly he would have had few tales of glorious daring to relate on his return to Europe and this may explain his biographer 's cursory treatment of these years. # Despite the lack of decisive military confrontation, William can have been in no doubt that the Kingdom of Jerusalem was plunging inexorably towards disaster. It was apparent to those living in the Kingdom of Jerusalem that a catastrophe was looming. Shortly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tyre wrote that it now seemed inevitable that the ' palm of victory, which had so often been earned ' by the Christians would soon pass to their Muslim foes and he expressed his fear that Jerusalem could not be saved. If Marshal had considered forging a new life in the Levant in 1183, he likely discarded those plans in the face of this mounting evidence of imminent collapse. # AFTER AN ABSENCE of around two years, Marshal returned to western Europe at some point between the autumn of 1185 and the spring of 1186. A little over a year later, the cataclysm that had been threatening finally struck. On July 4th, 1187 Saladin crushed the Latin Christians at the Battle of Hattin. Guy was taken prisoner, Reynald of Chatillon was executed by Saladin 's own hand and 200 knights of the Military Orders were also put to death. Later that year Jerusalem itself was recovered for Islam and the sultan ordered the huge cross atop the Dome of the Rock to be ripped down and smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coloured his visit to the East, Marshal 's pilgrimage had a lasting spiritual impact and exerted a significant practical influence over the course of his remaining years William made a heartfelt commitment while in the Near East to end his days within the Templar order. After his return to the West, as his career blossomed in the service of Henry II, Richard I and King John, Marshal cultivated ever closer ties with the Templars in England. By the early 13th century he had befriended the order 's local master, Aimery of St Maur, and this connection may have helped the embattled King John to garner the Templars ' much-needed support towards the end of his reign. In May 1213 the critical negotiations to secure John 's rapprochement with the papacy were held in a Templar house near Dover and less than two years later the first major assembly on the road to Magna Carta was convened in the Templars ' London headquarters. Marshal played a prominent role in both of these meetings and was later named, alongside Aimery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magna Carta itself. # WHEN WILLIAM 'S HEALTH finally failed him, at the age of 72, he summoned Aimery to his deathbed and the master duly inducted him into the order. Around this same time Marshal also revealed that, while still in the Holy Land, he had secretly made another provision for the eventuality of his demise. Most Latin Christian pilgrims and crusaders who visited Jerusalem travelled back to Europe with some token of their journey ; many First Crusaders had returned carrying palm fronds in imitation of Christ. William bought two large lengths of precious silken cloth in the Holy City to serve as his funerary shroud. These were carefully packed away and borne back to England in total secrecy. It was only as his last days approached, more than 30 years later, that Marshal ordered these same silks, the spiritually resonant mementos of his crusade, to be brought from their hiding place. William Marshal died on May 14th, 1219. In accordance with his wishes his body was wrapped in the Levantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church, where his tomb effigy can be seen to this day. # FARTHER READING # Thomas Asbridge, The Greatest Knight : The Remarkable Life of William Marshal, the Power Behind Five English Thrones( Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015). # Sidney Painter, William Marshal : Knight-Errant, Baron and Regent of Medieval England( Johns Hopkins Press, 1933). # David Crouch, William Marshal : Knighthood, War and Chivalry, 1747( Routledge, 2002). 1219 # Bernard Hamilton, The Leper King and his Heirs : Baldwin IV and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem( Cambridge, 2000). # A joust between a crusader( left) and a Muslim, from the Luttrell Psalter, c. 1340. # Above ; tomb effigy of William Marshal, Temple Church, London.
