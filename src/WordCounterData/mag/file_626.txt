4144641 Locally Sourced Homemade Greenhouse # We built this 10-by-lO-foot greenhouse using rough-cut lumber from the local sawmill and recycled windows donated by folks in town. People who have more building know-how than I came out to help create a basic plan that would make the mismatched windows appear symmetrical in their layout. We needed a structure that was sturdy enough to withstand northern New York 's harsh climate of bitterly cold winters and windstorms that often gust up to 60 mph. # The greenhouse door is from a local hotel that was renovated. The plastic that makes up the roof was a remnant from a local greenhouse that was re-outfitting its hoop houses.( After three years, we have n't had so much as a tear in the plastic.) The screened top windows all open on hinges, and have hook-and-eye hardware to hold them open on hot days. # We also installed a " sleeping loft, " which doubles as a great, sunny spot for seedlings. A small sleeping cabin next to the greenhouse( built the following year and appropriately coined " the birdhouse ") @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to water all the plants in the greenhouse. # All main greenhouse construction was completed in two full days of work. It took an additional day to stain the walls and paint the window trim, and another day to put on the door and roof plastic, and install the sleeping loft. Now we no longer have to do battle with our rocky soil when starting seedlings. # Nicole Caldwell Redwood, New York # Well-Traveled Heirloom Beans # Seventeen years ago, my husband and I planted what we called old-timey ' October ' beans. When cooked, these beans were larger than other soup beans and had a much stronger and better flavor that we really appreciated in hearty dishes. At harvest time, we carefully separated the beans from the pods, dried them in trays, and then measured them into baggies and placed them in the freezer. # We ate most of the beans during the first couple of years. But we held back two small bags of dried beans, just in case we could plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee to Kentucky and then back to Virginia, we also moved the bags of beans, taking care to keep them frozen. # In 2010, when we moved back to Virginia, the first thing my husband did was plant a garden. He saved space for the beans in the warm summer soil. # It was amazing to see every bean seed sprouting. They grew into little bushy vines, produced flowers and formed pods. I could barely leave the red-striped pods alone until they were dry. # These dried bean seeds, which were stored in the freezer and carried through three states over the course of 17 years, still produced an abundant crop. # Arlena Musick Abingdon, Virginia # Chickens Learn to Love Japanese Beetles # My wife and I have had a flock of chickens for several years. We had also been battling Japanese beetles. Last year, I noticed that my chickens were doing a great job with most of my yard pests, but not the Japanese beetles. So, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding them to the birds. At first, they would just poke at the beetles, but they soon figured out they could eat them. In just a few weeks, they were gobbling up any beetles they found in the garden or yard. # Ross Lenharth Dover, New Hampshire # You can read much more about using chickens in the garden -- for homemade fertilizer as well as pest control -- at http : //goo.gl/fu42G. -- Mother # Use a Pastry Bag to Apply Grout # For great control when applying grout, I use a large, plastic-lined fabric pastry bag. I also use a piping tip that gives me the best control over the grout application, which makes it look professional. # Kathleen Bander Bellingham, Washington # Classic Cheese Spread From Leftover Cheese # Almost everyone inevitably finds small, dried out or moldy bits of cheese forgotten in some remote corner of the refrigerator. A Danish friend of mine explained to me that you can use these old bits of cheese to make what she called potkase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, cut off any mold or inedible rind and then finely grate the remaining piece. Put these cheese shavings into a glass jar and cover them with any kind of liquor. My friend 's favorites were aquavit and rum, but any hard liquor will do for this purpose. All manner of hard cheeses can be mixed together in this fashion. Just stir the mixture periodically and you will end up with a yummy gourmet treat that is nice enough to serve as a delightful spread at parties -- and all made from leftover bits of food you would have otherwise thrown away! # Marilyn Foley Philadelphia, Pennsylvania # Here is a recipe for potted cheese from our food editor, Robin Mather. # 3 ounces of butter 6 ounces of a variety of hard cheeses, chopped or grated( no rinds) 3 tbsp of port, sherry or brandy Salt and pepper # Cream butter, then work in cheese. Season and add liquor. Cover and store in a cool place. Will keep 2 to 3 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family plays this entertaining, multigenerational backyard game : The goal is to rack up points by either throwing the bag into the hole( 3 points) or by landing the bag on the 2-by-3-foot platform( 1 point). Any beanbag that slides off the platform is not counted. # The beanbag toss should be set up on a relatively flat area, with a pair of game platforms set 25 feet apart from the front of one platform to the front of the other platform. The beanbag pitcher should not step beyond the front of the platform " setback line " when he or she is pitching. # Either two( singles) or four( doubles) players can play. The first player or team to reach 24 points is the winner. When one side reaches 12 points, the players can switch sides to give everyone the same advantage( in case of sun exposure or sloping surfaces, etc.). # Robin Anderson Puyallup, Washington # Best-Tasting Carrots # West of the Cascades, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the easiest of these is carrots. I plant successive patches, and those planted midsummer are ready to be dug in early winter. Apparently, carrots tend to increase their sugar content to avoid freezing during winter months. They are oh-so-tasty -- better than any store-bought options. In our area, they can generally be left in the ground without protection, but in colder areas, mulching should keep the frost at bay. Another good over-winter crop in the Northwest is potatoes. P.S. A good book for Northwest gardeners is Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades by Steve Solomon. # Gene Nutting Lake Stevens, Washington # Favorite Herbal Flavors # We asked members of our Facebook community( ' http : //goo.gl/a7LtKJ to tell us their favorite ways to incorporate herbs into foods to add an extra depth of flavor. Their creative responses made us all hungry. # Herbed Butter : We mix minced herbs( sage, rosemary, chives, etc.) into softened butter, roll the mixture into a log inside parchment paper, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a plastic container. Having this compound butter to spread on biscuits, potatoes, bread and steaks is a luxury all year long. -- Angela Clouse Johnson # Herbed Vinegars and Salts : I make herbal vinegars and dry as many herbs as possible for use later in the year. My favorite way of using herbs in everyday cooking and baking is to grind up a blend of dried herbs and add it to salt. It not only cuts my salt intake in half( half herb, half salt), but also introduces a hint of flavor right at serving time. -- Michelle Van Boven # Grilled Goodness : I like to use rosemary, basil and oregano on my grilled vegetables -- potatoes and summer squash especially. Just slice the vegetables, brush olive oil on the flat sides, press the oiled slices into the chopped herbs, and grill as usual. The flavor is delightful. -- Karen Brown # Basil and Tomatoes : I love fresh basil added to Roma tomatoes. I cut the tomatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a dash of salt and pepper, and then add freshly chopped basil leaves on top. Drizzle with a little olive oil and voil It 's amazing. -- Joy Gaymer-Moore # Herbal Tea and Salad Dressing : I add all kinds of herbs to my salad dressings. I also dry and freeze herbs -- some we drink as teas. Nettles and yarrow are our favorites. -- Edyta Blaszczuk Schranz # Flavorful Salad : I like to chop fresh herbs and mix them into green salads. Adding herbs is simple but adds lots of flavor. -- Jeff Lingle # Basil Bouquet : Fresh basil is heavenly! Cook with it, of course, but it also makes for a wonderful, aromatic centerpiece -- just snip a large bouquet! -- Terese Roberts # Mama Hen Adopts Guinea Keets # We own a 60-acre farm outside of Ingleside, Ontario. My husband and I wanted to try our hand at raising a few guinea fowl this year, so when we saw an ad in our local newspaper for keets, we ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days old. I felt so guilty that these little guinea babies had no mommy to care for them ; my heart broke every time I saw the keets huddled in a corner shivering. I had asked the breeder whether they could be integrated with a chicken, and she warned me that the chicken would probably kill them. # It just happened that at this time I also had a young mama hen sitting on 12 eggs. She seemed overwhelmed by the task, so I carefully placed her with her mother( who was broody, too) and split the eggs six and six. Eleven hatched, so everything was fine -- I thought. Then, the daughter hen( Virginia) no longer wanted her mom( Lacie) around, and let her know at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the nursery was getting ugly, and I had no choice but to remove Lacie. So, I took a chance and introduced Lacie to the " other " babies. # It was like night and day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the keets took to her like ducks take to water. It has been a delight to see them progressing from frightened little balls of fluff to following her around and pecking at everything she presents. # Lacie is beside herself, and she has made it clear to us that " you ai n't takin ' these from me, too! " Helene A. Oakes Ingleside, Ontario # Make Nutritious Snacks From Broccoli and Cauliflower Leaves # As I carried a pile of broccoli and cauliflower leaves toward the compost pile, my husband asked whether they were edible. I 've been gardening for years but did n't know, so I looked online. I was astonished to discover that just about all parts of the plants are edible! The leaves can be stir-fried, roasted, used as wraps or made into nutritious snack chips. # To make chips( you may be familiar with kale chips) from broccoli or cauliflower leaves, cut out the central rib, which can be chopped and used in other dishes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and massage the pieces in a bowl with a splash of soy sauce and enough olive oil to coat. Spread the coated leaves evenly on a cooking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes. Stir them around and cook for another 10 minutes. Sprinkle on a little salt to taste. Turn off the oven, and keep the leaves in the oven while it cools -- they 'll get crisp without burning. # Store your nutritious snacks in an airtight container. # Lauren Turner Sequim, Washington # This hand-built structure in New York proves you do n't need a lot of money for a gorgeous, sturdy greenhouse. # ' October ' beans( aka ' Fall ' beans) are tasty and prolific, and their seed can remain viable for many years. # Use fresh herbs to make compound butter. # Have orphaned poultry babies? You can try using hens as foster moms. # This simple beanbag game is a fun, simple way to play outdoors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
