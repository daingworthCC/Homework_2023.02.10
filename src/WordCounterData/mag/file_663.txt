BUILD THIS " MINE " TO FIRE OFF SPARKLING CONFETTI AT YOUR KID 'S NEXT BASH # * In fireworks lingo, a mine is a device that shoots sparks out of a mortar tube. No dangerous explosives here ; instead we utilized everyday party poppers to launch colorful trails of confetti. This project is a playful introduction to the world of pyrotechnics. Youngsters building the popper will wonder what exactly makes it pop( answer : compressed air) and how that energy forces the confetti out of the tube. But all that physics stuff aside, who are we fooling? The best part for the kids( and the adults) will be pulling the trigger on this explosive device, no matter the occasion. # PREPARE THE MINE # 1. Refashion the 1/2 x 3/4-inch adapter fitting( Fig. C) by sanding its ridges until it can be inserted into the 6-inch-long PVC pipe( Fig. A). # 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the slip coupling( Fig. B).3. Drill a centered 7/8-inch hole in the top of the 4-inch PVC drain cap( Fig. D).4. Lay the drain cap on its side and drill a small hole, centered, in the side. MODIFY THE POPPER # 1. Remove the top paper disc from the wide end of the popper and take out all contents, including the paper streamers and the bottom paper disc. # 2. Extend the popper string and firmly tie a 12-inch-long string to its end with a square knot.( You 'll pull this extended line to set off the popper.) # ASSEMBLE THE COMPONENTS # 1. Push the modified party popper into the adapter fitting with the string extended out through the threaded end. # 2. Insert the adapter fitting through the drain cap. Secure the fit by fastening it with the 1/2-inch conduit locknut.3. Place the taped slip coupling over the exposed popper so that it nestles into the adapter fitting.4. Slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortar tubing.5. Thread the popper 's string through the small hole in the side of the drain cap. DECORATE # 1. Paint or apply contact paper, duct tape, and/or stickers to the barrel and base as desired. # LOAD THE " AMMO " # 1. Fill a 1/2-ounce portion cup( the kind that you put ketchup in at McDonald 's) about a quarter full with confetti.( The less you pack, the higher the pop.) # 2. Push the portion cup down the barrel of the mortar tube until it rests on the slip coupling.3. Hold the base firmly with one hand and grab the string with the other. Pull smartly and enjoy the show!
