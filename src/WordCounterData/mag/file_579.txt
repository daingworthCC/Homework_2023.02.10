It was a year before my GCSE exams : my classmates and I were just leaving a Citizenship class, and we were chewing on them like gum. They were mint flavored. We had just been taught how to put condoms on plastic penises as an introduction to our sexual lives--as if the Government had said : " Go on, you young rascals, go fornicate, because now we 've told you you can.

Crew, makes some anatomical observations of a skeletal marvel from " four feet away. " Can you stand it? # My evening life revolves around Legos and hide-and-seek. I try to reserve time to go out on the nights that Beckett is with his dad. Mostly I see friends and go to dinner. I just went to see the Rolling Stones ; Mick Jagger was four feet away from me.

And it was on such a night in June 2003 that I met Margaret Thatcher. The meeting was n't entirely auspicious : she did n't know who I was, and, more importantly, I did n't know who I was, until I saw her across from me and realized I would n't shake her hand.
