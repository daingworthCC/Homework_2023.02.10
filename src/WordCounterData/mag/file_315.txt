2038341 Section : SPECIAL REPORT Kodak offers an object lesson in the perils of downsizing <p> Through its history, America has gone through repeated cultural and economic upheavals. Such changes are little understood in their early stages, and their future effects on the lives of Americans are rarely appreciated at the start. The flight from inner cities to the suburbs is one post-World War II example. The shift from a society of single-breadwinner families to one with two full-time wage earners per household is another, with effects still to be reckoned with. <p> Another great and more recent shift is downsizing. For the past year, the nation has engaged in a great debate over the effects of massive corporate layoffs. Newspapers have tugged at hearts with woeful stories of workers thrown out of jobs, even as experts say that leaner, meaner companies have helped build a growing and more healthy economy. President Clinton regularly claims credit for an economy that has created 10 million new jobs. At the same time, however, American companies have been discharging workers at the rate of about 500,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunbeam Corp., which announced last week that nearly 6,300 employees, half of its total work force, would be let go. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is at nearly historic lows while the stock market roars to new highs almost every week. <p> A good place. Everyone knows that downsizings are bad for employees who are let go. But how about for the companies? Are the decisions to let workers go being made for good corporate reasons, with beneficial business results? <p> Some answers may lie in Rochester, N.Y. A century ago, on the shores of Lake Ontario, a junior bank clerk named George Eastman founded Kodak, a company whose industriousness and benevolence made Rochester the epitome of the American company town. Eastman had a vision for his community, and as Kodak prospered, Rochester blossomed into a vibrant center of research and the arts. Its handsome, tree-lined streets made it a good place to live for a population of proud, skilled workers. " I was happy growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of people flew the flag every day. You could look forward to going downtown to shop. " <p> That all began to change 15 years ago, as Mama Kodak, as the company was once affectionately known, stumbled over its own success. Accustomed to hefty annual profits, Kodak had grown complacent while competitors and new technology passed it by. The prospect of a Japanese camera with a computer chip that could record pictures digitally -- replacing Kodak 's film -- is what shocked the company to its senses. But under intense pressure from Wall Street, Kodak 's main response to these challenges was not innovation but downsizing. In just eight years, it halved its Rochester work force to 34,000 people, cutting the payroll by $1 billion. Other local companies, among them Xerox and Bausch &; Lomb, also cut staff. Still others, including R.T. French and Gannett Co. ' s corporate headquarters, simply left town. Employment by the city 's manufacturing sector slumped from 40 percent in 1981 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard on Rochester is obvious. The surprise is that none of Kodak 's cost cutting improved the company 's performance. After more than a decade of downsizing and re-engineering, the company still had to make a clean sweep of its executive suites to turn its prospects around. <p> Kodak 's experience is hardly unique. A study last year by the American Management Association found that fewer than half of the companies that had downsized since 1990 saw operating profits increase the following year, and even fewer reported increased profits over the longer term. Only a third reported higher productivity in the first year after cuts. " What drives these things is diminished profits, " says Alan Downs, an executive who used to endorse downsizing but has become a critic of the practice. " But they do n't solve the company 's problems ; they just lay off people. " Some former top Kodak executives admit openly today that the downsizings were a mistake. " They were devastating, " says Edwin Przybylowicz, Kodak 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of talent and also in terms of morale. " <p> Rochester today appears to be recovering, and Kodak is on the mend, though for reasons unrelated to its job cuts. Unemployment in the city remains low, below 4 percent, while dozens of new high-tech firms have sprouted. <p> Downshift. But there is rot beneath the floorboards of this prosperity. The layoffs have caused a massive shift away from high-paying jobs to positions offering far more modest wages. Pay levels for the greater Rochester area have been flat going back to 1989. Home values have been, too. <p> At the same time, there has been an explosion in temporary, or contract, employment, with area companies spending up to $200 million on " flexible staffing " this year alone. By one employment agency 's estimate, almost a third of the region 's workers are in such jobs, ranging from unskilled factory laborers to chemical engineers. " People get caught up in the numbers, which do n't look bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester region for New York State 's Department of Labor. " But the kinds of jobs being created are not the same as the ones eliminated. " <p> In many ways, Rochester is a portrait of America at the end of the American century. It grew up with one of the nation 's great businesses and now has changed because of it. Kodak 's experience is not a perfect lens for understanding all of the changes that have shuddered through American corporations recently. But Rochester has seen more downsizing in 10 years than other cities have in decades. Its story lays plain the causes and consequences of such measures. <p> Until 1982, Kodak was successful, generous and predictable, very much like its founder, George Eastman. A century earlier, the company began with Eastman 's innate understanding of chemistry and a series of home experiments in what was then an arcane hobby, photography. Eastman developed an emulsion and a process that employed gelatin and collodion to make a flexible, cellulose photographic film. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras. Customers took the pictures and sent the whole camera back to Rochester for developing and reloading. Eastman even came up with the name " Kodak. " The word meant nothing, but he thought it catchy. <p> The company was successful almost immediately. By the turn of the century, Kodak dominated Rochester, and George Eastman was a millionaire. The company 's 19-story headquarters building, just north of downtown, was crowned by a red " Kodak " sign, glowing in Rochester 's night sky. Like the skyscraper, Eastman 's munificence was everywhere to be seen. He gave millions to the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology. He founded the Eastman School of Music, the Rochester Philharmonic and the city 's theater. He built a $2.5 million dental clinic. Eastman 's biographers estimate that he gave away nearly $1 billion( in 1996 dollars) during his lifetime. " George Eastman wanted to nourish a vital community, " says Peggy Hubbard, development director at Rochester 's Memorial Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as intent on rewarding his employees. Each year, Kodak awarded a generous wage dividend to each employee. Downtown stores were so jammed that non-Kodak shoppers stayed away on bonus day. Employees recall lavish Christmas parties and eight-course, $1-a-plate clambakes on the lake. " It truly was a family, " says Gary Penix, a computer operator who worked at Kodak for 23 years until 1990, when he was let go. " Times were great, and we 'd find any excuse to celebrate. " <p> The party ended on Aug. 24, 1981. On that day Sony unveiled the Mavica, a camera unique for what was -- or was n't -- inside it. The camera did n't use film. Instead, it recorded images on a computer chip. Kodak had been working on the same idea but had n't dared market the thing for fear of undercutting film sales. The Mavica did n't do well commercially, but it made Kodak face the unthinkable : a world without film. That prospect divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush to develop digital cameras. The other thought it suicidal. The debate escalated into a fight for the company 's soul ; it would continue, unresolved, for years. " Short of the royal family, " says former Vice President Katherine Hudson, " Kodak was the world 's largest dysfunctional family. " <p> With its future at stake, Kodak could n't afford to fail with new products, but fail it did. A disk-film camera suffered from grainy pictures and bombed on the market in 1982. Kodak was late getting into autofocus, 35-mm cameras. While the company floundered, Japanese-owned Fuji Photo Film Co. moved aggressively into the U.S. market. Kodak 's version of a Polaroid-style instant camera, meanwhile, was halted when a federal judge found the company had violated Polaroid 's patent ; Kodak paid a fine of nearly $900 million. Then it delayed selling a disposable camera until 1987, though it had developed one years earlier. <p> The problems caused by the disk camera and other missteps caused Colby Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch a reorganization in 1984. Tom Coyle, working as a production supervisor, remembers the first layoffs, when Kodak let 800 people go. " We had to go down to their lockers, clean them out, walk the employees out to the gate, " says Coyle, who took a buyout in 1991 and is now a real-estate agent. " This was unheard of. " <p> The cuts did little to appease Wall Street. Kodak 's sales climbed from $10 billion in 1984 to $20 billion in 1992. But net income, which was $923 million in 1984, dipped in the years that followed and ended up at $994 million in 1992. By then, activist investors and market analysts had discovered that they could pressure companies into cutting costs and make stock prices jump to enrich their portfolios. Bludgeoned by such Wall Street " advice " to cut its payroll, Kodak 's top managers began slashing jobs. About 5,000 workers had taken early-retirement offers by the end of 1984. In 1986, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide. A quarter of those let go were fired. In 1988 and 1989, Kodak cut an additional 4,000 workers in Rochester and 7,500 worldwide. All told, Kodak had shed some 18,000 workers in Rochester by 1990, most through buyouts. <p> Wall Street was happy about the cuts, but they did little to lower Kodak 's expenses -- at least in the short term -- since the company gave many employees generous buyout packages. There was another unforeseen consequence : The company was losing its most promising technicians, engineers and executives. " We downsized first, " says former Kodak executive Lawrence Matteson, now a business professor at the University of Rochester. " We thought about how to reorganize second. " <p> Kodak 's shortsightedness worked to Richard Mulcahy 's advantage. Mulcahy and three other senior employees in the optics division took the buyouts in 1989, against the pleas of the company. " When I signed the buyout, they were speechless, " recalls Mulcahy. " They told me I had until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Instead, he and his co-workers founded Opkor, a precision plastics company that now makes viewfinders and lenses for Kodak while competing against Kodak 's optics division on some contracts. <p> Bailing out. It was n't just college grads taking the money and running. A whole league of plant workers who were nearing retirement called it quits. These included a group of German immigrants who had arrived in Rochester after World War II, tool-and-die men who had worked on the machinery within the company 's centerpiece, Kodak Park. " There were people who knew the nuts and bolts of the operation and had been there 25 years, and they all left, " says Craig Erickson, a retired quality-control manager. " Waste levels and inefficiency and customer complaints ran out of control for a year and a half. " <p> Chandler, who still lives outside Rochester, declined to be interviewed for this story. In 1990, he was succeeded by Kay Whitmore, a lifetime Kodak employee. Whitmore, who also declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another trend of the 1980s : diversification. As company president under Chandler, Whitmore was credited with creating billions of dollars of debt for Kodak by pressuring it to purchase two companies, Sterling Winthrop Inc., a pharmaceutical business, and L &F; Products, maker of household goods. Suddenly, Kodak was hawking Lysol, Mop &; Glo and Chubbs baby wipes. " It had dirtied up its balance sheet, " says Brenda Landry, an analyst who watches Kodak for Morgan Stanley. " They had leveraged themselves out to buy Sterling. " <p> Chided to come up with a master turnaround plan, Whitmore convened an executive retreat in July 1991. At last, Kodak was going to face its future. That was the plan, anyway. The site for the retreat was a modern hotel at Niagara-on-the-Lake, a comfortable Canadian resort town just 90 miles from Rochester. In attendance were about 50 company executives, including some who had flown in from Europe and Asia. Participants say things started off routinely enough, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Smith, Kodak 's top financial officer. <p> But it proved to be a mistake to begin a retreat about " ideas " with a report about money. Bill Fowble, the head of manufacturing, was unable to ignore Smith 's dire numbers. " The only way we are going to make our goals is to downsize by 3,000 people, " Al Sieg, then head of strategic resources, recalls Fowble saying.( Fowble died recently.) Others chimed in, and before long, Kodak 's strategy session for the future turned into a rehash of the tired old debate about costs, one that Peter Palermo, once a Kodak senior vice president, knew all too well. " It 's become a macho thing, " says Palermo. " How big are your cojones? You cut 20,000 jobs ; I 'll cut 40,000. " That night, Whitmore summoned a few top executives and announced a decision : He would cut 3,000 more people. <p> What happened next was worse. Whitmore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doozy. Workers whose age and years of Kodak employment totaled 75 were offered one year 's severance pay, a full pension and " bridge " payments of $700 to $900 a month to carry them until Social Security payments kicked in. Kodak 's personnel experts predicted it would attract about 3,000 workers. <p> Their calculations were slightly off : Exactly 8,321 employees took Whitmore 's buyout offer, 4,000 of them in Rochester alone. The most talented survivors in all ranks, some just 47 or 48 years old, marched out the door. " There was no one literally left to take my place, " says Hal Gaffin, the head of printing and publishing. The key people who had mastered the nuances of Kodachrome film, a process that was as much art as science, departed. Kodak 's loyal customers called as never before with complaints about the quality of film and service. Many employees, including four of Whitmore 's own top executives, quit, then had to be hired back on contracts. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its earnings. Ironically, notes Al Sieg, the downsizing " did n't seem to do a lot to help the company ; ' 92 and ' 93 were not great years. " <p> Rochester 's waves of layoffs have made the city home to a thriving employment industry, with temporary-employment firms scrambling to fill job orders with employees who have little choice but to work in these insecure positions. Some of these agencies pocket more than half an employee 's salary, meaning that many line workers earn just the minimum wage. Even experienced engineers sometimes earn as little as $12 an hour, and that 's with no benefits. " For every person laid off, there 's a flex-staffing job added, " says Jackie Tedesco, president of Burns Personnel Inc., which has done business in Rochester for 28 years. " Of course, it 's not the same job and not the same dollar, so companies are spending less overall. " <p> In Rochester at least, the lure of cost savings has proved powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area 's employees are " flex " workers. Some temp firms now offer health benefits, but nothing that approaches what a large corporation might provide. <p> For workers, these jobs present a mixed bag of opportunity. While some eventually get permanent slots, most bounce from job to job. Three years ago, for instance, Christine Cummings was downsized by Xerox. She then did secretarial work, dispatched school buses and even shoveled snow with her husband, John, who was downsized by General Motors. They came close to losing their home. Next, Cummings got a job recruiting other temporary workers for an employment company. Now she is back at Xerox in the same contract job she held when she joined the company seven years ago -- as a student intern. " I 'd love a rut, a good rut, " Cummings says. " We just want to work, to trade our talent for a paycheck. There 's a lot of energy you expend worrying about your job. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Today it says no more than 10 percent of its work force is temporary. That still amounts to about 3,000 workers in Rochester, however, the majority of them recently hired. Kodak human resources chief Mike Morley says that hiring temps and contractors actually protects the jobs of Kodak 's permanent workers because Kodak can easily shed the temps, leaving permanent workers ' jobs intact. Many Kodak employees do n't see it that way. " You start wondering, when are they going to take my job? " says Tom Overmeyer, who arranges movement of materials and supplies in Kodak Park. <p> In a slump. Rochester 's size, cultural scene and low cost of living were once great draws for the employees of Kodak and other companies. Today, the city suffers from the same problems as other cities : crime, declining schools and struggling neighborhoods. It is hard to tell how much the downsizings have added to these woes, but there is a connection. Companies like Kodak and Xerox support hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic activity in the metro area can be attributed to Kodak 's presence, " says economist Kent Gardner. The city of Rochester itself has slumped under the wave of layoffs and buyouts, losing bundles in jobs, income and tax revenue. The downtown district, a collection of historic and newer buildings that straddles the Genesee River, has a 16.6 percent commercial vacancy rate, which jumps to 22 percent for the older buildings. At night, the place is a ghost town. <p> The troubles are n't confined to the city. Building permits for single-family homes have declined from about 1,800 in 1992 to 1,250 today. " Looking for real estate in Rochester, " says Rome Celli, a real-estate agent with Remax Wharton Associates, " is taking a tour of empty homes. " <p> For many employees who have been laid off, simply keeping their homes is the biggest challenge they face. Tony Cuva was a $36,000-a-year communications technician at Kodak until 1989, when his job was outsourced to Digital Equipment. Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worked a regular job since. His wife has been cleaning houses for extra money, and Cuva has worked a number of contract jobs, but, he says, " we have n't been able to pay the mortgage for a long time. We were served with foreclosure papers, but we 're hoping they do n't start any action until winter. " <p> The downsizings have hit the area 's social and cultural worlds with the same force, although not as much as might have been expected. In surrounding Monroe County, 1 in 7 residents receives government assistance from programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, school lunches and drug and alcohol treatment. In terms of percent of the overall population, that 's not much higher than it was a decade ago. <p> The impact of the downsizings has been felt more keenly by charitable organizations. Kodak has cut its giving nationwide by 35 percent, from $14 million in the mid-1980s to $10 million now. Between 1993 and 1996 its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2.75 million. " It 's good for us to get off this Kodak tit, " Mayor William Johnson says. " This is a wake-up call. " In the same breath, though, Johnson notes that Kodak 's generosity " sets the tone for everyone else. I 've been at meetings with business leaders where no one would even make a funding decision until they knew what Kodak was going to do. " <p> Rochester 's vibrant cultural institutions, which George Eastman and Kodak always backed enthusiastically, also have been hit hard. Ten years ago, Kodak gave the Memorial Art Gallery a $55,000 unrestricted contribution. Today, its gift is $25,000 -- less than half. " It 's a killer, " says the gallery 's Peggy Hubbard. " It 's discouraging when we 're working so hard to cut and raise revenue and the corporations still cut their contributions. " Such cuts, by Kodak and others, have caused the gallery to raise revenue in other ways : store sales, underwriting, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curator salaries and reduced operating hours. At the Rochester Philharmonic, one of the very institutions Eastman founded, Kodak 's $60,000 annual contribution is a fraction of what it once was. " Basically and simply, " says Norm Spindelman, the Rochester Philharmonic 's lawyer, " we do n't get the dough. " The orchestra is now running a $1.4 million deficit. <p> Kodak and Rochester finally began to put their darkest moments behind them in 1993, when George Fisher succeeded Kay Whitmore as the company 's chief executive officer. The day that happened, Kodak 's stock shot up by $3 a share. After the disastrous 1991 buyout, Whitmore had struggled to remake Kodak, while Wall Street continued to badger him to sell off the outside companies. Whitmore 's own version of a downsizing package was comfortable, even by Kodak standards : a $374,255 bonus, $96,154 in vacation pay, $930,769 in salary and a $1.67 million severance payment. <p> Fisher, who had led Motorola Corp. through ara of improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside businesses and pumped up overseas marketing efforts. He says that Kodak ca n't shrink its way to success and has halted sweeping layoffs in favor of targeted cuts. Fisher also signaled an end to **34;692;TOOLONG. " You do n't have to run the place that way, " Fisher says. " You do have to come through with results. It 's up to us to decide how to get there, not Wall Street. " Most important, Fisher quickly came up with the simple strategy for the future that had eluded company executives for 15 years : Sell both film and digital imaging. Film was still a huge business, Fisher said, and Kodak was a film giant. It could be a digital giant, too. " Just as Motorola was beautifully positioned to take advantage of the wireless revolution, " he says, " I saw Kodak as best positioned to take advantage of what I would call the digital-imaging revolution. " Kodak 's stock today is trading at about $80 a share, almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do well by that, since the pay package Kodak offered him includes an annual pay and bonuses that came to $9 million in 1995. <p> Renewed growth. Rochester 's turnaround has been less dramatic, but it is happening. A new Blue Cross Blue Shield tower is on the drawing board, and a new addition to Rochester 's grand old library is currently underway. Gannett, which publishes the city 's two papers, is building a new printing plant. There 's a new minor-league baseball stadium, and Tops Friendly Markets, a grocery chain based in Buffalo, recently agreed to build stores in some run-down neighborhoods. The most dramatic growth seems to be in the better-off suburbs, however, with an abundance of new development and construction. " There 's a lot of purchasing power in this community, a lot of wealth on the southeast side, " says Kent Gardner. " I see the community as very stable. " <p> But the numbers do n't explain everything about Rochester. The years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took buyouts, the depressed home prices, the diminished incomes, the surge in contract employment all still play significantly on the moods and values of the community 's residents. " A lot of people inside Kodak had their heads down, working hard, " says Allan Waugh, a laid-off Kodak engineer who worked days in a local factory and nights cleaning a church before being hired back. " They did n't realize that the rules of the game had changed, that we 're all just a commodity now.
