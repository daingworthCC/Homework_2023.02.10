Stuck on Her Ex " I broke up with my boyfriend and told him I needed him out of my life for a while, but after a few days, I could n't help wondering what he was up to. I was coming home from the movies late one night and decided to drive by his house. After I saw that no one was home, I realized I was acting like a stalker. I backed into his driveway to turn around, but they were repaving and it was covered in mud, and my tires got stuck. Horrified, I floored the gas, but the car would n't budge. I looked up just in time to see the headlights of my ex 's truck coming right at me. He parked his car, got out, and asked what I was doing in his driveway at one in the morning.

Flirting With Disaster " I was jogging in the park with my friend when we spotted my crush walking up ahead. As I got closer, I was trying to look really cool, which is tricky to do while maintaining a running pace. When I passed him, I slowed down a bit, said hey there, and turned to give him a killer smile -- not paying attention to the fact that I was headed directly for a tree. I ran into its trunk, fell to the ground, and tried to pick myself up, but in the process, I tripped and landed in a bush... not exactly how I planned on getting noticed. " -- Amy, 20 Sex-Texting His Dad " To pique my boyfriend 's interest, I used my camera phone to take a sexy picture of myself wearing only underwear, then sent it to him in a text that read ' Just me and you tonight?

' Turns out, I 'd punched speed dial for ' Kevin 's dad ' instead of ' Kevin. '? " -- Jennifer, 25 The Naughty Professor " I was studying abroad in London and taking a history class with a very old, proper male professor. Before a lecture one day, I went into the bathroom to pee. As I was sitting there, the door busted open and in walked my prof. He stuttered, ' Oh my, miss, I 'm sorry! ' before scurrying out. So after he had gotten a full-frontal view of my girl parts, I had to sit in his classroom -- the class had a total of five people in it -- while he lectured and tried not to make eye contact with me. That had to be the longest hour of my life. " -- Sonya, 20 Kinky Conference " I 'm a teller at a bank, and I spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty conference room. One day, I was spilling to my coworker about how my fianc and I had been trying out kinky sex. I went into detail about how much I enjoyed being spanked and that I was considering getting a piercing down below. Seconds later, I heard muffled laughter. I looked over at the door and saw that it was wide open, as was the door to the conference room across the hall. My manager, regional manager, district manager, and several other coworkers were sitting around the table with raised eyebrows. I mumbled an apology and did n't look any of them in the eye for several weeks. " -- Jessica, 22 Wedding Hells " When I attended my cousin 's wedding, I had just broken up with my boyfriend and was fragile about being single. The time came for his bride to throw the bouquet, but I was talking to my grandmother, so I did n't join in as the deejay asked for all the single girls to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, until finally he said, ' Could Zoe please make her way to the dance floor and join the other single girls? Zoe? Zoe? ' I skulked to the floor with 200 people watching. Apparently, my cousin had pestered him to make sure I was included. I then thanked him for announcing my relationship status. " -- Zoe, 29 Damage Control " She could do a presidential wave or maybe even curtsy just to get a laugh out of the crowd and make the whole scene less awkward. Then she should definitely find the guy who caught the garter and ask him to dance. " -- Eric, 23 Control Freak " I was nervous about meeting my boyfriend 's family for the first time, so before I met them for dinner, I gave myself a pep talk about acting cool and collected so I 'd really win them over.

His father offered to drive us home so he could show off the GPS system in his new car. Without thinking, I said I was a pro at navigation programs, hopped in the passenger 's seat, and started fiddling with the buttons. I played with the controls until I heard a weird beep, and the entire thing shut down and would n't power on again. The car went silent, and my guy 's dad was fuming. When we got out and his parents drove away, my boyfriend was so mad that he would n't speak to me. " -- Kaylen, 22 Baby, Baby " My friends and I were shocked when we found out our pal Taylor 's boyfriend was cheating on her with a girl we knew. We wanted to make sure he did n't get away with being such a dirtbag, so we schemed up a well-deserved revenge plot. We bought a home pregnancy test and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped by the guy 's house to ' say hi ' and left the positive strip in a conspicuous spot in his bathroom.

" -- Shelley, 25 Stinky Slipup " A friend and I decided to try out a Pilates class at my local fitness club. Since I 'd never done it before, I wanted to stay under the radar during the first session, so she and I set ourselves up in the back row. During the workout, the instructor led us through a few strengthening exercises. We started doing leg lifts, and as I lowered my legs to the ground, I accidentally let out a huge fart. It was so loud that the entire class stopped and turned to look at me, and the instructor paused for a minute and chuckled to herself. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened, but it was months before I could manage to show my face in the gym again. " -- Reva, 20 Brief Encounter " My guy and I had been fighting nonstop, so we finally decided to call it quits. After we were officially over, everything became really tense between us, and we both tried to do anything to make each other jealous. For two weeks, he had been nitpicking over the belongings that he 'd left at my house, including a certain pair of underwear. I did n't make any effort to find them because I thought he was being ridiculous, but he kept bugging me about them, so finally, I got the stupid briefs, folded them nicely, and tied a ribbon around them. Then I went over to his house and left them on his bed with a polite note, proud to have acted so civil. The next day, he stormed into my place and threw the briefs at me, saying, ' These are n't mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy I 'd hooked up with the week before. Whoops. " -- Jill, 25
