4150241 Section : Departments : MANUALToolbox # TABLE # It can be hard to follow guidelines precisely when cutting wood, especially if you 're tracing a perfect circle or punching unsightly knots out of a floor-board. You could solve the problem with a $10,000 CNC machine, a large device with range limitations. You could risk steering a router by hand. Or you could use the newly developed Shaper, which combines the two tools to cut precise right angles and curves. A would-be carpenter first draws the shape he wants to cut in third-party graphics software. Then he pushes Shaper over the wood. The tool automatically adjusts the path of the cutting bit to match the digital image, amending the line to within a hundredth of an inch. " You can think of it as autocorrect for your hands, " says Matty Martin, the designer who created the latest prototype. The Shaper company demonstrated its machines at Maker Faire in May and will begin beta testing this summer, through the website shapertools.com. ANDREW ROSENBLUM #
