The porch of the Greek Revival house is crowded, too, with Ben Kleinpeter 's large family -- and with the memories and stories of the home 's long history. For more than two centuries, the Kleinpeters have celebrated Christmas in South Louisiana. And since 1895, when Ben 's great-grandparents bought the cottage, holidays have centered around t this simple house built of cypress and heart pine. Though beloved as a family homeplace, the home 's true history was n't discovered until Ben, a student of Louisiana history and decorative arts, moved the house. " When my father died in 1984, my brothers and sisters gave me the house, " he explains. " I decided to move it back 1,000 feet to be away from a commercial area. When we did that, I saw the house I was a lot older than we had originally thought. That motivated me to restore and refurbish it for my home. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with H. Parrott Bacot, executive director of The LSU Museum Complex and curator of the LSU Museum of Art. " He and his wife, Barbara, did 95% of the research, " Ben says. Working with the Bacots, he learned the original house was built as a Greek Revival-style cottage around 1870. As the house was being restored, Ben traveled through Louisiana and Mississippi, looking for appropriate furnishings. Even before the major pieces, such as a Natchez dining table, were in place, he filled the house with his collection of 19th-century Louisiana landscape and sporting paintings. Though the house is on the National Register of Historic Places, it 's still very much a family home, and homeplace to a large extended family. " My father was one of 11 children, my mother was one of 12 children, and I am one of 11. All of us have happy memories of this house, " Ben says.

" It was a pretty good spread. " This year the celebration of family ties will go on as always -- with one change. Ben 's daughter, Sue Ann Cox, and her husband, James, are owners of the home and keepers of the family 's history and heritage. " I was ready for something else in my life, " says Ben, who recently moved to a patio home nearby. " My main idea was to continue the house in the family and to educate my grandchildren to appreciate our history. Sue Ann will do that.
