2010941 and wanted to send you a hearty " Thanks! " I have not seen Nia 's movie or TV show yet, but I now consider myself a fan. She is a refreshing, delightful, obviously talented, and beautiful real-life woman. Traci Miller Williams Woodville, Alabama Hooray for Nia Vardalos! She looks great just the way she is, and she 's also an inspiration. We should all take a lesson from her and realize we are beautiful in our own way, even if we do n't fit the cookie-cutter mold that Hollywood tries to cram us into. C. Miller Norton, Virginia I saw your terrific April cover of Nia Vardalos and I just had to buy it. Nia and I have so much in common. We are both from Winnipeg-how exciting! But I wanted to let you know that Winnipeg is located in Manitoba, not Ontario, as written in your article. Again, congratulations on a great cover.

" I am a larger-size woman and get so disgusted by the fact that most magazines do not pay any attention to women over size 12. When I saw women wearing plus-size jeans on your pages, it made me so happy! I want to thank you for what you 've done to make me feel prouder than ever about who I am. Keep up the good work ; I intend to recommend you to all my friends. Jessica Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to your article " I Thought I Was Too Young for Osteoporosis " February. Not only did I think I was too young to have the problem, I believed that, since I 'm part African American, I was exempt. Boy, was I wrong! Most doctors do not give bone-density tests to women under the age of 30, but at 28, I found out that I was at risk for having osteoporosis. Knowing this, I would encourage all women to have the test regardless of race or age. Ruby Stewart Riverside, California Shared story I was so moved by " When a Pregnancy Goes Wrong " April, about the woman whose babies had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The article really hit home, since I also experienced this problem when I was pregnant with my own twins. My outcome was not a positive one like that of the woman in the story.
