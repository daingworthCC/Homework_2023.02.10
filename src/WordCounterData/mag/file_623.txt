Let 's hope this move is a sign of more competition to come. # BEST SHOCKING TRUE CONFESSION # " I recently tried to refinance my mortgage, and I was unsuccessful in doing so I 'm not making that up. " # BEN BERNANKE, former chair of the Federal Reserve, on how banks may be making it too hard to get a mortgage # BEST SIDE EFFECT OF THE HACKING MESS # SAFER CREDIT CARDS FINALLY # Chip-and-PIN credit cards include a special chip that makes them harder for hackers to replicate. Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a card number is stolen, more-secure plastic can save you a lot of hassle. Card companies had been slow to roll out chip-and-PINuntil millions of credit card numbers were stolen from major retailers such as Target and Home Depot. " The frequency and size of the breaches absolutely are driving more rapid adoption of the technology, " says Paul Kleinschnitz of First Data, a payment technology firm. Here are two more things to know about the new cards : # THEY DO N'T ELIMINATE ALL YOUR RISK. Chip-and-PIN makes it harder to create fake plastic but does n't stop numbers from being used at online stores. So you should still check your statement regularly for weird charges. # A BONUS FOR TRAVELERS. Chip-and-PIN is already common in Europe ; the new cards work in automated machines there that do n't accept old-fashioned plastic. # BEST NEW WAYS TO Invest WISELY # Smarter tools and new perspectives to help you build your nest egg and make it last for decades. # BEST ANSWER TO YOUR TOUGHEST NEW PROBLEM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry is when interest rates will rise again. Since bond values fall when rates rise, the bonds you own for safety suddenly feel high-risk. But Colorado Springs financial planner Allan Roth says a look at the numbers should dampen your worry, as long as you have a long-term focus. After the initial drop, the higher yields you 'll get in bonds can help make up for the fall. Many Fed observers expect rates to rise one percentage point next year. Below is what happens in a typical bond fund if rates spike twice as much, by two percentage points, and then flatten out. # ANNUALIZED RETURN ON AN INTERMEDIATE BOND FUND IF RATES RISE TWO POINTS # The following text appears within a chart.

SOURCE : Vanguard, via Allan Roth # BEST TIMELY TRICK FOR FINDING BARGAIN STOCKS # COUNT ALL THE CASH # When you 're hunting for a bargain stock, a rich dividend is a classic place to start. A big payout is a sign that a company has to do something extra to attract buyers. And a firm with cash to distribute may be more stable than other unloved stocks. But dividend yields average just 2% these days. # THE CONCEPT : " If you just look at dividends you ignore a significant piece of the pie, " says portfolio manager Patrick O'Shaughnessy of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. Also add in stock buybacks, which can be a better use of cash than costly acquisitions often are. To do that, calculate " shareholder yield. " A company paying 2% that bought back 3% of its shares in a year would have a 5% shareholder yield. # THE NEW WAY TO INVEST : Cambria Shareholder Yield ETF( SYLD) buys stocks that score high on this measure. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR RETIREMENT # Half of all workersand three-quarters of part-timersdo n't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k). The new MyRA, highlighted in President Obama 's State of the Union address in January, will fill in the gap, helping millions start socking away money for retirement. Even if you are already well on your way to establishing your retirement nest egg, you could learn something from this beginner 's savings account. # THE IDEA : The MyRA, rolling out in late 2014, is targeted at workers without employer plans. Like a Roth IRA, the contributions are n't tax-deductible, but the money grows tax-free. Savers fund a MyRA via payroll deductions, with no minimum investment and no fees. # WHAT 'S TO LIKE ABOUT THIS BABY IRA : The MyRA 's investments, modeled after the federal government 's 401(k)-like Thrift Savings Plan, emphasize safety, simplicity, and low costs. Those are principles more corporate plansand individual saversshould embrace. # THE BEST WORKPLACE PLAN THAT 'S FINALLY COME OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for retirement and then pay taxes when you withdraw the funds. With a Roth 401(k), you do the opposite : take a tax hit upfront but never owe the IRS a penny again. Few workers take advantage of this option. Now that could be changing. # This year Aon Hewitt reported that for the first time, 50% of large firms offer a Roth 401(k), up from 11% that did so in 2007. Adoption levelsstill only 11%tend to pick up once plans have a Roth on the menu for several years and new hires start signing up, Aon Hewitt reports. # A recent T. Rowe Price study found that even though young workers who expect to pay higher taxes in the future reap the greatest benefit, savers of almost every age collect more income in retirement with a Roth 401(k). A 45-year-old whose taxes remain the same at age 65 would see a 13% income boost, for example. And, notes Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, " the money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEFENSE AGAINST RUNNING OUT OF MONEY # When the only retirement plan you have at work is a 401(k), you may yearn for the security you would have gotten from monthly pension checks. Pensions are n't coming back, but the government is letting 401(k) plans be more pension-like. A rule tweak by the Department of Labor and the IRS should make it easier for employers to incorporate deferred annuities into a 401(k) 's target-date fund, the default retirement option for many. Instead of a portfolio of just stocks and bonds that grows more conservative, target-date savers would have a portion of their funds socked into a deferred annuity, which they could cash out or convert to a monthly check in retirement. Done right, the system could re-create a long-missed pension perk, says Steve Shepherd, a partner at the consulting firm Hewitt EnnisKnupp. " They are making it easier and more cost-effective to lock in lifetime income. " # BEST BIG IDEA IN THREE CHARACTERS # " r&gt;g " # That 's economist THOMAS PIKETTY 'S formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Piketty says the return( r) on owning capital tends to be faster than economic growth( g). If he 's right, the rich will pull away from the rest. And it 's a reason to own stocks and other long-term assets. # BEST WAY TO GET ADVICE CHEAPLY # THE RISE OF ROBOS # In 2014, Internet-based " robo-advisers " went from a novelty to a force that 's changing how you get and pay for money advice. In a nutshell : They 're driving costs to the floor. Some of investing 's biggest names are going robo. The competition breaks down into two types : # PORTFOLIO BUILDERS : Startups like Betterment and Wealthfront use algorithms to design you a mix of low-cost index funds. They charge no more than 0.25% to 0.35% of assets per year, less than traditional advisers. Giant Schwab has announced a similar, free service.( Schwab is paid in part by putting customers into Schwab 's funds.) # COMPUTERS PLUS PEOPLE : LearnVest is more focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will also connect you with a financial planner for investment and other advice. Vanguard 's new Personal Advisor Services will create a portfolio for you, and assign you a planner you can talk to, for 0.3% per year.

But a new study by financial economists Campbell Harvey, Yan Liu, and Heqing Zhu argues that many of these discoveries are probably illusory. With the advent of cheap, powerful computers, academics are making more and more " discoveries " over 200 just in the past 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, suggests researchers are simply picking up a lot of random noise. # The following text appears within a chart.

But money can be replacedand you have legal protections. What you should worry about is a hacker mining your more vulnerable iCloud photos, Facebook page, or email account and impersonating you. Two-factor verification, a login protocol, makes it vastly harder for hackers to steal your digital life. # 1 The Threat : Personal stuff like your photos and email are housed in the " cloud, " not on your computer. # 2 The Setup : Select " login approval " or " two-factor verification " under settings at sites you want to protect.3 The Login : The first time you visit that site on a new computer, enter a code that 's texted to your phone.4 The Hassle Factor : You only need to put the code in the first time you log in to a site on a new computer.5 The Backup : In case you lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which work once.6 The Protection : A hacker needs to guess your password and have physical access to your computer. # BEST STATE LAW THAT THE OTHER 49 STATES SHOULD ADOPTSTAT # HEALTH CARE PRICE TRANSPARENCY # Employers and insurers are making you foot more of your health care bills in the hope you 'll pay more attention to the bottom lineand even seek out less expensive care. That 's one reason the average deductible now tops $1,200. The problem : How can you shop around when you ca n't find out what doctors and hospitals charge? # THE BREAKTHROUGH : Massachusetts has become the first state to require hospitals, physicians, and insurers to share price estimates. As of October, residents can go online and compare costsespecially helpful for screenings, lab work, and other straightforward care you can plan for in advance.
