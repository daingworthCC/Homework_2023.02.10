2023441 FEEDBACK // THE LOVE PROJECT Editor 's Note : By the time you read this, I will probably have received more than a thousand letters in response to my June editorial, " Editor as Guinea Pig : Putting Love to a Real Test. " Here 's a sampling, followed by letters on other topics. -R. E. If you put yourself into the experiment, you risk your credibility as a researcher. How will you keep your professional detachment and objectivity in a subject that addicts one to another, accelerates the mind and distorts perception? Frank Holloway Lawrenceville, NJ I am 28 years old, single and no longer discouraged-because of you. I have been involved in passionate relationships that have lasted only a few months and then fizzled when the passion subsided. I knew these relationships were a waste of time, and it is comforting to know that I was right. Good luck to you in your quest. You are truly an inspiration. J. P. Via e-mail Hats off to you. Fourteen years ago, I worked for a matchmaking service. Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that a perfect foot existed for every glass slipper presented by those men. Perhaps the " knight in shining Porsche " is n't as gender biased as you might be led to believe.We observed that the men were far more receptive to unconventional methods of meeting a mate than the women. Lori Hinton Springdale, AR I read your quest to marry for more " practical " reasons. My husband and I did just that.We both had many common interests that we thought would make us good partners. Sometimes, though, I have felt like I 've wanted more. I think that society has something to do with my partially unrealistic expectations of wishing we were more like " soul mates. " Perhaps if married people talked more openly, it would help. I wish you success. Kristine Shultis Via e-mail I agree with you. We woo our prospective spouses through a dating system where we are continually wearing a mask of " how we want to be known. " In a prearranged marriage, the couple learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to unlearn the mask. I 've been searching for a Russian wife. These marriages have a divorce rate of between 5 and 10 percent, much better than what we are accustomed to. I suppose these are semi -- prearranged marriages with no false perceptions to unlearn. Martin Sacramento, CA This " experiment " would involve a huge amount of sharing. gaining an intimate understanding of another person ; facing fears ; finding the " treasures " within each other ; leaving what does n't work and creating what does ; learning how to be open and honest.All of which can produce great joy. Even though your experiment sounds crazy, I keep hearing the words of Zorba the Greek " A man needs a little madness, lest he dare not cut the rope and be free " J.B. Auckland, New Zealand If I subscribe to the theory that creating love is a very conscious choice( and I do), then what you propose has awesome possibilities.Writing about the experience will surely bring a deeper understanding between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining it is the issue.When you find the answer, it will be of tremendous use to humanity.You are bold and brave to commit to this process. I applaud your resolve.You are definitely a love pioneer ; you and your chosen partner are in for an adventure. Michelle Laguna Beach, CA The reason for the lower divorce rate( for arranged marriages) in developing countries is the stigma attached to women who seek separation and the slim chance of success in a second marriage.Where there is education and emancipation of women, you 'll find an increase in the incidence of divorce. Any system is as good as the individuals concerned in the process. P. N. S. Mani Via e-mail Your idea is very interesting, and the out-of-the-box thinking is even better. Wow. I work with patients who live in a polygamist Mormon community and I have always been interested in their way of life( the arranged-marriage part, not the multiple-wife part). These adults seem to be much happier with each other than married adults( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be onto something. Dr. Karon Lynn Flagstaff AZ THE END OF HATE I loved your article " Why We Hate "( June 2002). wish every American could read this article. Maybe some of us would see how wrong it is to judge people as a whole.As Carl Rogers would point out, every individual must be shown unconditional positive regard. We need to remember that although we may have roots in other areas of the world, we are all Americans. // Wendi Lane Travis Air Force Base, CA DEAR DIARY Thank you for the article " Dear Mother "( June 2002). My mother passed away two years ago and I have had similar feelings. Although my mother and I were close, I regret not spending more time with her. I hope my mother knows how much I will always love her. You have inspired me to write my memories and new experiences in a diary to my mother. Daniela Friedman Toronto, Canada COVER BOY : NOAH WYLE Thank you for putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). know that psychology is now a female-dominated profession and that females are more emotionally aware than males.While women are more likely to be your audience, some men are still interested in psychology. Noel Mathiesen Armidale, New South Wales, Australia LOVE IS EVERYWHERE I enjoyed reading the article " Love Is Not All You Need "( June 2002). However, I could not help but notice that all six couples profiled in the article were opposite gender. Gays, lesbians and bisexuals are frequently made invisible in our society. However, they still love and still have relationship difficulties. It was clear that the authors of the article made an effort to include a diverse range of couples. Adding a same-gender couple would have been a useful addition to the story. Laurie Pollack Philadelphia, PA UNEXPLAINED After reading the article " Galvanizing Ghosts "( June 2002), I recalled how researchers of the paranormal classify certain activities as " ghosts of memory. " People have reported seeing ghosts reenacting the same kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ghostly apparitions as projections of our own minds.We need to remain open on this subject ; we still do n't have all the answers.
