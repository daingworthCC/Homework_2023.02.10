Pariser believed his home was fully covered -- until a contractor told him it would cost $165,874 to rebuild. That was $62,445 more than his insurance policy would pay. <p> " What angered me most, " Pariser told a local newspaper, " is that I had asked my agent for the best possible coverage. " <p> In 1981, he 'd bought a homeowner 's policy that had been an HO-3 policy( see box, page 29). But, in the years since, his insurance company had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these policies were available to many homeowners at lower premiums than standard HO-3 insurance. <p> Pariser, and other homeowners who claimed they only learned about the better coverage after Hurricane Andrew, complained bitterly that guaranteed replacement-cost policies were offered as a matter of course to new policy owners -- but long-term customers were left uninformed. <p> In fact, a group of them filed suit against several large homeowner 's insurance companies, arguing that the companies had been negligent in not telling their customers about better coverage. <p> Of course, they could have asked their agents or insurance companies if there were newer, broader policies available. <p> This article offers some basic buying guidelines and tips that smart insurance consumers can follow to maintain cost-effective coverage on their homes. <p> Policy Terms and Conditions. It 's no brilliant conclusion to say that insurance consumers -- like consumers of anything -- should compare the various products they 're considering buying. The problem with insurance is that people do n't always know where to look. <p> When considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the replacement value of your home -- and how insurance companies calculate this figure. <p> You should have enough insurance to cover the cost of rebuilding your home. This may be different from the market value or assessed value ; that 's why the most popular policies currently are the ones that guarantee replacement value. They eliminate the homeowner 's risk of being caught short. <p> Some homeowners get into automatic insurance packages that limit homeowner 's coverage to the amount they owe on their mortgages. If you have that kind of insurance -- and especially if you 've paid off a good part of your loan -- take some time to review its coverage. It could mean that if something bad happens, your mortgage company will be paid off, but you 'll be left with a vacant lot where your house used to be. <p> Always buy insurance for at least 80% of your home 's replacement value. If you buy less, you forfeit the right to collect the full replacement value of the insured property, even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three price factors, which put limits on the amount of recovery. It is important to consider these factors when purchasing your policy : the loss payment shall not exceed the limit of insurance on the building, the loss payments shall not cover any more than the cost of similar construction, and in no event shall the loss payment exceed the actual cost of repair. <p> You can raise or lower the other coverages a standard homeowner 's policy offers to meet your particular needs. <p> Most policies cover personal property for 50% of the insured value of the house. So, if your house is covered for $100,000, the insurance company will pay up to $50,000 for loss or damage of its contents. For a higher premium, you can increase that coverage to 75%. <p> Most policies do not cover damage to-or loss of -- cars, aircraft, or pets. For some items, there are limits to coverage for theft. Those vary somewhat from company to company, but the following limits are typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on firearms ; $2,500 for business property kept at home ; $1,000 to $2,000 on jewelry, watches, and furs ; $1,000 on securities, deeds, manuscripts, and other valuable papers ; $1,000 on boats ; and $200 on coin collections, gold, silver, and currency. <p> These limits apply to each category of item, not each item. You can buy additional insurance to raise the limits on any of these categories or to protect specific valuables. <p> Inflation-guard clauses written into policies ostensibly protect the homeowner against rising construction costs, yet many storm and fire victims find that these clauses fail to keep pace with the market. <p> A caveat : Construction prices can jump even higher after a major disaster -- like a hurricane or earthquake -- when building materials and labor are in short supply. <p> Owners of older homes often fare the worst with inflation-guard policies -- and even **27;560;TOOLONG policies. These adjustment mechanisms do n't usually cover the expense of upgrading older homes to meet current building codes. <p> An estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Oakland Hills fire were code-deficient. Most of these people had to battle their insurance companies for what they considered standard coverage -- and bring their rebuilt houses up to code. <p> If you own a house that 's more than 20 years old, you may need to buy additional coverage that assures any rebuilding will bring the house into compliance with current codes and zoning laws. <p> Watch The Price Tag. Premiums are based on property value, type of construction, location, etc. When comparison shopping, keep in mind that there are many ways to reduce the amount of premium that you pay for your homeowner 's insurance policy. <p> Before purchasing your home and the insurance for it, take into account the types of construction and your location. In California, for example, the cost for wood-frame construction ranges from $1.50 to $3.00 per $1,000 of coverage, depending on location. Lower rates apply in the central part of the state ; higher rates in the coastal counties and those along fault areas. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fires, or natural disasters -- can expect to pay more than residents of low-loss areas. <p> Buying a combination of two or more types of coverage, or " package policy, " can help keep costs down. The Homeowner 's Policy Program provides liability automatically in addition to the property coverages. By combining property and liability coverages, the insurance company is able to reduce processing costs, determine losses more accurately, and pass these savings on to the consumer in the form of lower premiums. <p> For most homeowner 's forms, a principal amount of insurance is selected for the dwelling. Reasonable amounts of coverage are then automatically provided for other coverages based on a percentage of the amount provided for the dwelling. <p> These reasonable amounts are not the maximum amounts available ; they are simply limited amounts of coverage that satisfy the average needs of most homeowners. If a particular person has a greater exposure, greater amounts of insurance may be purchased. <p> For example : You have $10,000 of coverage for other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling. If your four-car detached garage has a replacement cost of $30,000, you may need to purchase more " other structures " coverage -- in which case, an additional premium will be charged. <p> Under HO-4 and HO-6, the principal amount of insurance is selected for personal property -- and a reasonable amount of coverage is automatically included for other coverages, based on a percentage of this amount. <p> A few other tactics that can help keep premiums down : Raise Your Deductible. The higher your deductible, the lower your premium. If you raise the deductible from $250 to $500, you may be able to trim more than 10% off your premium. Raise it to $1,000 and you could save more than 25%. Ask About Your Fire-Protection Class. The closer you are and the better the professionals are trained, the lower your premiums should be. The Insurance Services Office assigns every neighborhood in the United States a fire-protection class, based on the quality of fire protection and the distance of homes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating systems.) If your assigned class is n't right, you may be paying too much for your insurance. Look Into a FAIR Plan Policy, if you 're having difficulty obtaining insurance in the standard market. FAIR plans were created to make basic property insurance available to consumers in areas where coverage is difficult to obtain or has become otherwise unavailable. The FAIR plan writes coverage in designated urban areas and hazardous brush areas. The federal government provides riot reinsurance for insurers that participate in a HUD-approved FAIR plan. <p> Any person having an insurable interest in property in an officially designated area who has been unable to obtain coverage through normal channels is entitled to FAIR plan coverage. <p> Review Coverage Every Few Years. One of the most important things to consider regarding your homeowner 's insurance is not to assume that everything has been taken care of -- or that it has been taken care of in the best way for your needs. <p> If you rely on your insurance company or agent to set your policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find yourself underinsured when you file a claim. This can be a serious problem. In extreme situations, you can deal with underinsurance by having your policy upgraded retroactively. But this kind of solution is rare -- and getting rarer, as insurance companies operate on ever-thinner reserves and profit margins. <p> The fact remains that, if you have n't reviewed your homeowner 's policy in the past few years, your home may be underinsured. The house you insured for $115,000 five years ago could cost $150,000 to rebuild today. Any additions, renovations, or major purchases could also have boosted your coverage needs. <p> Also, if other assets you own have grown substantially, your personal liability limits should be adjusted to keep up with them. <p> The HO-3, or special homeowner 's policy, protects your home against all perils except those specifically excluded by the contract. It typically costs 10% to 15% more than the HO-1 policy. <p> Many insurance companies also offer guaranteed replacement-cost policies, which go a step further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full amount needed to replace your home and its contents, even if that exceeds the policy limit. <p> Despite its name, however, many companies set limits for this coverage, paying only up to 120% or 150% of the policy 's face value. The limit for contents coverage is generally set at 75% of the home 's replacement cost, as opposed to the standard 50% on other policies. <p> Some old homeowner 's policies pose a particularly significant risk, called implied co-insurance. This comes from the standard provision in most homeowner 's policies that the insurance company will not cover a portion of any loss greater than the proportion of the existing policy limit to the market value of the insured house. <p> For example : You have a house that would cost $200,000 to replace, but your policy has a $100,000 limit. Your insurer can maintain that you were purposefully taking on some of the risk of insurance -- in this case, 50% of the risk. Assume you have a $150,000 loss, including contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were adequately insured, in this case, the insurer may say the coverage is half that, or $75,000. <p> Warranty Insurance. Keeping up to date with your homeowner 's insurance needs is important because the insurance industry is changing constantly. And the advisory role that personal insurance agents used to play is disappearing. As a result, policy owners are left to battle insurance companies over coverage issues. <p> A recent illustration : With developers facing intense financial pressure in the current weak market, a growing number of new-home buyers demand insured warranty programs to pay for the cost of defective construction or unforeseen repairs to their new homes. <p> The policies usually cost several hundred dollars and cover major structural repairs for as many as 10 years and less severe problems for one or two years. But a series of lawsuits has raised concerns about whether owners of these policies have been getting their money 's worth. <p> With growing frequency, particularly in cases where the home builder has gone out of business, the warranties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company over whether the coverage applies under the contract. Usually such disputes are heard by arbitrators. <p> In a 1991 case challenging the practices of home-warranty companies, a federal appeals court in Virginia required Denver-based Home Buyers Warranty, the nation 's largest such company, to abide by an arbitrator 's award of more than $200,000 to a policy owner. The company had sought to push the case into court. <p> The issue before the fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals centered on whether an arbitrator 's award of $206,605 in damages to a homeowner in one such dispute was binding, or whether it could be appealed by the insurer through the courts. National Home Insurance had argued that either party had the option of appealing if dissatisfied by the arbitration award. <p> But in a 12-page opinion, the appeals court ruled that Home Buyers Warranty 's contract language specifically requires binding arbitration. <p> This conclusion should n't have come as a surprise. In 1990, a Texas jury ordered Homeowner 's Warranty Corp., the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages to a policy owner whose house was falling apart because of a crack in the foundation. <p> Homeowner 's Warranty, which denied coverage, had assured the buyers that all homes insured under its program were inspected on a continuing basis during construction -- a point that was contested at trial. Of the total jury award, $325,000 was for punitive damages intended to deter future wrongdoing. The two sides agreed to settle the case out of court for an undisclosed amount. <p> Exclusions and Other Red Flags. An important point to remember when buying homeowner 's insurance : All types of coverage pose certain exclusions. Some people overlook these exceptions when reading through their policies, later to find that their assets were not protected under their policies. <p> It is important to know when coverage does and does not apply. You should know the common restrictions of your policy before you purchase it. <p> Understand the concepts involved in rating procedures. Although there will be variations to contend with for different companies and different states, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic understanding of the application of rules under the traditional rating procedures will make it easier for you to understand how rates are charged and adapt to future changes. <p> The age of a home is an important factor to insurance companies. Companies may charge up to 20% less to insure new homes than to insure older ones, which may be more susceptible to damage in storms and fires. Outdated building standards and old wiring can also make older homes riskier to insure.( See " What Do You Mean It 's Not Covered? " CR, September 1995.) <p> Making Claims. The process of making a claim on your homeowner 's insurance policy is referred to as the adjustment process. It is a negotiation, in which knowing your rights can be pivotal. <p> An insurance company has the right and the option to investigate and settle any lawsuit or claim against you. It also accepts an obligation to defend any lawsuit or claim -- but if it pays the limit of its liability to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide any further defense. <p> At the same time, it is also important to know the role you play in reporting a loss. Here are just a few effective ways to help ensure the best response to your claim : Give Immediate Notice. Promptly give notice to your insurance company or agent after a loss to covered property has occurred. Make an Inventory List of the Damaged Personal Property. Include all bills, receipts and related documents that justify the figures in the inventory. Notify the police as soon as possible after a loss by theft. Notify the credit card or fund transfer card company of loss or theft of a credit card or funds transfer card. Make an Attempt to Protect the Damaged Property from Further Damage. If repairs to the property are required, make the reasonable and necessary repairs as well as keep an accurate record of the repair expenses. <p> Read your policy and know the type of coverage you have. If you know the basics about your coverage, you 're more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ways to double check your policy : <p> Verify the Adjuster 's Estimate. Do n't accept the settlement until you get a written bid from a licensed contractor to make sure the adjuster 's estimate is realistic. <p> But, before you bring in outside experts, check their qualifications. Keep Records. Make copies of all information in connection with your claim. Hold onto everything the insurer gives you. You may also want to take notes of meetings and conversations with your agent, insurer, or claims adjuster. Do n't Settle if the Offer 's Unfair. If you ca n't reach an agreement, contact your agent or the insurer 's claim-department manager before making a settlement. <p> The way you handle the steps of this process can determine whether you come out of the loss financially whole. <p> If you think you need to sue your insurance company because you are dissatisfied over a claim, you have to have complied with the policy provisions concerning the reporting of the loss, cooperating with the company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare and contrast any large expense that you may have, and homeowner 's insurance is not an exception. Research will help you. find the coverage that suits you and obtain that coverage at affordable premiums. <p> It is important to compare not only insurance companies but the prices and coverage within each insurance company as well. With some shopping around and just a few adjustments, you will be able to find coverage in a package that suits you and your homeowner needs. <p> BASIC TYPES OF HOMEOWNER 'S POLICIES <p> Most insurance companies offer six basic types of homeowner's-insurance policies. Every insurer may not offer all six, and the names and specific limits( named perils) of coverage may vary somewhat from company to company. In most states, these are the typical options : HO-1. This basic homeowner 's policy protects your home against 11 named perils. This coverage is rarely enough, so many states are phasing out this type of policy. HO-2. This broad homeowner 's policy covers your home against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most mobile-home owners. This type of policy generally costs 5% to 10% more than the HO-1 coverage. HO-3. This special homeowner 's policy protects your home against all perils except those specifically excluded by the contract. It typically costs 10% to 15% more than the HO-1 policy. <p> Many companies also offer a guaranteed replacement cost policy, which goes one step further than a standard HO-3. It offers to pay the full amount needed to replace your home and its contents, even if that exceeds the policy limit. This type of policy, usually written as a form of HO-3, offers coverage similar to what was formerly called HO-5, a policy that has been phased out by most companies. HO-4. This renter 's policy generally protects the possessions of tenants in a house or apartment against 17 named perils. It also provides liability coverage but does n't protect the actual dwelling, which should be covered under the landlord 's policy. Renters who don! t want to pay for liability protection can opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This policy for co-op and condominium owners provides coverage for liability and personal property, much like HO-4. While insurance purchased by the co-op or condominium association covers much of the actual dwelling, individual owners who want coverage for improvements to their units must write them into an HO-6 policy. If you add a porch, for instance, you 'll need an endorsement( an addition to your policy that expands its coverage). HO-8. Primarily for older homes, this policy covers the same perils as HO-1 but insures the house only for repair costs or its actual cash value, not its replacement cost. That 's because the cost of rebuilding some homes with the materials and details of the original would make replacement cost coverage prohibitively expensive. An HO-8 policy pays to restore the damaged property, but not necessarily with the same kind or quality of materials as the original. <p>
