The background players are having a great time too, especially based on the latest video shared by James Gunn from the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 set. <p> In his #GuardianPicOfTheDay, instead of sharing a photo from the set like he usually does, Gunn instead shared a video with the fans, via his Facebook page. In the video, Gunn shows just how much fun the extras were having on set, most of whom were playing members of Yondu 's Ravagers. You can watch the entire video, along with Gunn 's explanation of just what the heck was going on that day, down below : <p> So there you have it folks -- if you 're going to be an extra in a big budget Hollywood movie, try to get on the set of a James Gunn movie. Seems like that 's where they 're having all the fun. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too distant future, right? <p> What did you think of James Gunn 's behind-the-scenes video? And can you barely contain your excitement for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 just like us? Let us know down below in the comments.
