The New Nordic Diet. But unlike past regional approaches, this one is backed by as much strong science as cultural lore and is tailor-made for our times, stressing what we now know to be healthyorganic, local, sustainable foodmore than any weight loss plan before. # While the Mediterranean diet evolved from centuries of eating al fresco on Tuscan patios, the New Nordic Diet was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Copenhagen tasked top nutritionists, chefs, and economists with creating a diet that would combat obesity, chronic disease, and the eco-destruction caused by modern agriculture and animal ranching. The ambitious food plan also had to taste good enough to inspire locals to get back to their fishing and farming roots. # The result was a diet that empha-sizes eating whole foods, not counting calories or carbs, and closely resembles how you 'd eat if you could shop at your local farmers ' market all the time : as much organic produce as you want ; sustainably caught fish and shellfish ; whole grains like barley, rye, and oats ; beans and legumes ; wild foods like mushrooms and berries ; grass-fed game like venison ; and lots of canola not oliveoil, which has a healthier ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats. Kick out processed foods, and the NND 's creators hoped the diet would melt fat off anyone who followed it. # Turns out, they were right : Study after study has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean proteins, and complex carbs provides the right nutrients you need to shed weightnot the empty calories that pile on pounds.
