5004641 <p> " Obviously, it 's a bittersweet day for our organization, ' ' Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette said Wednesday night. " We watched Manny grow up in our franchise the past eight years. We all know what an exceptional talent he is, from the great plays that he made to his elite hitting. He 's always going to be a part of our important part of our club 's history. ' ' <p> The trade of shortstop Manny Machado to the Dodgers on Wednesday night started the inevitable rebuilding process for an Orioles team that has bottomed out in 2018. Thus, Baltimore approaches the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline in full selling mode. <p> 2 Related <p> Machado, 26, is expected to be introduced by the Dodgers in Milwaukee on Friday before they open a series against the Brewers. <p> The Dodgers are in a close race in the NL West, leading Arizona by a half-game going into the second half. <p> " Our first hope is we have a division-winning roster, ' ' Zaidi said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in a tight division race that 's something you have to look at closely. ' ' <p> Machado 's contract expires at the end of the season, and the last-place Orioles decided against negotiating an expensive, multiyear extension because they have too many holes as the team moves into rebuilding mode. <p> " We tried to maintain a competitive club this year, and that 's why we resisted the offers we had in the offseason to trade Manny, ' ' Duquette said. " But when it became obvious that it was time to look to the future, trading Manny is the first step in the plan to rebuild our ballclub. ' ' <p> Asked if the Dodgers would re-sign Machado, Zaidi demurred. <p> " Let 's have him at least show up in a Dodger uniform before we start asking those questions, ' ' he said. " We hope he plays well and creates a good market for himself. We 're not worried about what happens past 2018. ' ' <p> The deal hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Orioles having some issues regarding the physical of one of the prospects Los Angeles had agreed to send. <p> According to Fancred, the issue was not related to Diaz, the centerpiece of the deal. <p> Machado is off to the best start of his career offensively, tallying several career-high figures for the season 's first half, including home runs( 23), RBIs( 64), OBP(.384) and OPS(.950). <p> In his first year as a full-time shortstop in the majors, Machado was voted as the starter for the American League in this year 's All-Star Game. <p> A Platinum Glove Award winner and three-time All-Star at third base, Machado moved back to his original position this season. <p> Zaidi said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has explained to Machado about how much the team values flexibility and versatility in playing different positions. <p> " Manny being flexible with that and being able to move between shortstop and third, we believe he can be an asset at both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JT Justin Turner is down, Manny 's ability and willingness to play third base on those occasions will be really important going forward. Everybody is sort of on the same page about that. " <p> As for the prospects, Diaz, a 21-year-old Double-A outfielder, hit two home runs in Sunday 's All-Star Futures Game, becoming just the second player in the game 's history to homer twice. Alfonso Soriano is the only other player to hit two home runs in the Futures Game, doing so in 1999, the first year the game was played. On the season, Diaz is hitting.314 with a.905 OPS and has tallied 6 home runs, 30 RBIs and 36 runs scored. <p> Manny Machado, off to the best start of his career offensively, will be a free agent after the 2018 season. Shawn Thew/EPA <p> " We liked the depth of the Dodger package, we liked the quality of the players in the package, and we liked Yusniel Diaz, a player we feel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We felt he was clearly the best player offered to us during this recent market. He was the key to the trade. But the other players in the trade are also very talented.
