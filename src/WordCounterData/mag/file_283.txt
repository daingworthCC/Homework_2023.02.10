2034041 Section : Skin Fitness <p> How often have you decided not to exercise because it would wreck your hair? Whether you swim laps, run laps or form them doing sit-ups, do n't let fear of frizzies make you miss your workout. Three hair-care experts give us their solutions to your most common exercise-and-hair sticking points. TIME, TIME, TIME <p> " The most important thing when you exercise a lot and need to look great afterward is to start out with a haircut that fits your lifestyle, " says Federico, owner and director of Federico Hair Salon, Manhattan. " I know this seems like common sense, but I see a lot of people who cling to hairstyles that do n't work with what they do in their daily lives. " Take the time -- and the initiative -- to discuss your hair type and lifestyle with your stylist. Then take what they tell you into strong consideration -- even if it means cutting off those extra 2 inches you 've worked so hard to grow.( If the person is a good stylist, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So, what kind of style lends itself to lunchtime-and-later workouts? Easy -- one that requires minimal prep time. Not just because it will save you time, but because it also prevents overdrying with styling tools. " Short and long hair work best, " says Federico. If you 've shampooed, you 'll probably still have to use some type of styling equipment, but the right cut shortens styling time dramatically. If you really do n't want to get involved with a lot of styling, go for a short cut that you can just fluff with your fingers or blow-dry for a couple of minutes. Long hair works equally well because it has the advantage of looking great pulled up in a ponytail or back in a chignon. " The one thing I ca n't stress enough, " says Federico, " is to be sure you communicate your needs to your stylist. If your current do is n't doing it for you, let her know. " WHAT TO DO ABOUT WASHING <p> The single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " How often can I wash my hair without damaging it? " Although opinions differed somewhat among our experts, the clear majority felt that once a day is enough even for those with oily scalp and hair. " The sweat you generate in one day wo n't hurt your scalp as long as you wash within a 24-hour period, " says Rebecca Caserio, MD, clinical associate professor of dermatology, University of Pittsburgh. <p> The best regimen of hair care, even if you exercise vigorously, is to shampoo once a day using a pH-balanced shampoo. " Especially if your hair is fine or damaged from too many chemical processes, cleansing too frequently can be damaging. Your natural oils offer important protection to your hair shaft, " says Dr. Caserio. " If you strip too many of them out by shampooing, you create excessive dryness, which, in turn, eventually causes breakage. " <p> Even if you 've been blessed with a really thick head of hair, you still do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If not washing makes you feel uncomfortable, just rinse your hair well after your aerobics session. If you feel you absolutely must wash a second time, use baby shampoo so you do n't strip your hair. Gently massage your scalp with the lather and avoid fragile hair ends. <p> If your scalp is excessively oily, it 's true that exercise -- well, the sweating aspect of it, anyway -- only exacerbates the situation. " Use a shampoo that 's a little stronger, maybe something with zinc in it to get the oils out, " says Fredric S. Brandt, MD, clinical associate professor of dermatology, University of Miami School of Medicine. " If your condition is dandruff and you use a dandruff shampoo, limit its use to once a day or once every other day. Dandruff shampoos are harsher than other shampoos. " Wash your scalp vigorously daily but go easier on your hair itself. If you apply conditioner, do n't put it on your scalp -- it will just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just the ends. <p> Diagnosed your own scalp as dry? Be careful. " Sometimes what people self-diagnose as dryness is really seborrhea, a condition of overactive oil production, which creates flaking of the scalp as well as scaling around the nose and/or eyebrows, " says Dr. Brandt. " They see this flakiness and think they have a dry scalp, then they compound their problem by using heavy conditioners. " If you 're unsure, check with your dermatologist. MANE-TAINING ' YOUR STYLE <p> O.K., the style is low maintenance and we 're shampooing once a day. For many of us, that still means at least a little help from our styling tools. Try to limit the use of heat appliances to once a day. If your style is curly, use a dryer with a diffuser attachment. These are less damaging because they dissipate the heat and airflow. If your style does n't lend itself to this, try using a lower heat setting on your dryer. All in all, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force. To keep down heat damage, try a heated styling brush instead of a curling iron. <p> Do n't stretch and pull your hair when you 're blow-drying -- you can break the strands and even pull healthy hair out by the roots. " This styling routine, if you do it chronically, can lead to long-term hair loss, " warns Dr. Brandt. <p> For keeping long hair out of the way during and after exercise, Federico recommends good old-fashioned bobby pins. " Combs, barrettes and clips grab your hair and can tear fragile strands. " I explained to him that I trust his word, but I 'm not sure I 'm ready to have the world see me with my hair held back by bobby pins. " If you prefer the looks or control other methods offer, " he concedes, " at least be sure you open the gadgets properly and do n't just pull them in and out. " CONTROLLING OUTDOOR DAMAGE <p> We know that hair suffers from sun damage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bleach color-treated locks and can destroy the melanin in red hair, giving it a gray tint. Unfortunately, there does n't seem to be any research to show whether hair-care products with sunscreen make much of a difference. <p> Dr. Caserio feels that, " For protecting your hair outdoors, you ca n't beat a hat. " If you 're hatless and would still rather be safe than sorry, opt for a hairspray that has sunscreen. <p> Swimming presents an altogether different set of problems. You can and should wash your hair with a specially formulated product to remove chlorine after you 've been swimming, especially if your hair is highlighted or colored. Otherwise, chlorine creates a buildup that can discolor your hair. <p> " I really recommend that people use the shampoos designed for swimmers, " says Dr. Caserio. " They do get the chlorine out, which can help to keep your hair from discoloring. " Most beauty salons and many drugstores carry this type of product. <p> Swimmers can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair after showering and by always wearing a bathing cap in the pool. Just be sure to pull the cap off carefully. Dragging the cap on and off in a rough manner can create the hair breakage you 're trying so hard to prevent. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : A woman with a volleyball putting on a hat. <p> By Pamela Boyer <p>
