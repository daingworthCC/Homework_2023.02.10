2001941 // MS Repair 101 Of the many avenues of MS research, repair of damage to the central nervous system is one of the most exciting. It could mean the restoration of function lost to the disease. In MS, myelin, a fatty protein compound that insulates the nerve fibers in the central nervous system, is damaged by an immune attack. Ultimately, myelin scars over, inhibiting signals making their way along the nerves. Immune attacks also damage oligodendrocytes( the cells that make myelin) and the nerve fibers themselves, once they have been stripped of their protective myelin. It is the subsequent " disconnect " along nerve fibers that creates the myriad MS symptoms-from difficulty seeing to problems with balance and coordination. Repairing myelin, oligodendrocytes, and nerve fibers would probably not be sufficient to reverse MS. There must also be a way to stop the immune system from damaging the tissue in the first place. The combination of restoring function and stopping the damage process would mean the end of MS as we know it. The workshop Last October, 120 researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Central Nervous System in Nice, France. The workshop was organized by the National MS Society and co-sponsored by ARSEP( Association pour la Recherche sur la Sclerose en Plaques, a French organization devoted to MS research). Researchers focused on MS injury and natural repair, what stops natural repair, and ways to stimulate repair. Repair... naturally The body repairs some MS lesions-damaged myelin tissue-naturally. But not all of them are fixed. John W. Prineas, MD, FRCP( University of Sydney, Australia), Massimo Filippi, MD( Scientific Institute and Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy), and others presented evidence of the type of repair and reorganization that helps the brain to overcome injury in MS. In some lesions, the body can repair myelin after injury, either by stimulating neighboring oligodendrocytes or by recruiting young oligodendrocytes from farther away. They move to the lesion, mature, and make new myelin. Some participants noted that this natural repair process may actually be stimulated by the inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciphering the molecular " signals " that are sent out from injured areas to recruit replacement cells in the hope of finding ways to mimic these repair signals. Researchers are also investigating a number of proteins known as " growth factors " for their roles in myelin repair and nerve regrowth. Photograph // What inhibits repair? The human body is incredibly resilient-ask anyone who has ever had a broken leg or had their appendix removed. But in MS, the body 's tendency to repair itself gets short-circuited. Marie Filbin, PhD( Hunter College, New York, NY), and Stephen Strittmatter, MD, PhD( Yale University New Haven, CT), discussed three different components of myelin that can actually inhibit nerve fiber regrowth. These components may represent targets for future therapies designed to thwart their influence.

These include electrical impulses as well as molecular signals. During the course of MS, nerve fibers stripped of their myelin can become electrically silent, and without an electrical signal, remyelination may be inhibited. Molecular signals may also be lost, compounding the problem. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City discussed their studies examining MS lesions that did not show any signs of remyelination( Nature Medicine 2002, 10 : 1115-1121). They found high levels of a molecule, named " Jagged 1, " that can restrict the maturation of young oligodendrocytes and thus block remyelination. Other approaches to MS repair Moses Rodriguez, MD( Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN), has been purifying and reproducing antibodies( immune proteins that attach to specific molecules) that can stimulate myelin repair in rodents with MS-like myelin damage. Although it is not yet clear how these antibodies act to encourage remyelination, Dr. Rodriguez reported that they are being readied for safety-testing in people with MS. Ian Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Blakemore, MD, PhD( University of Cambridge, United Kingdom), and others discussed their efforts to replace oligodendrocytes and nerve cells surgically. They are using animal models of myelin damage. Potential sources of replacement cells include skin-derived cells, bone marrow and umbilical-cord blood cells, fetal cells, adult brain cells, and myelin-making cells from the peripheral nervous system, called Schwann cells. In a preliminary safety study, Schwann cells taken from a nerve in patients ' ankles have been implanted into MS lesions of a few individual volunteers by investigators from Yale University. The results have not been published. Bright horizon Few scientific fields are changing as quickly as the landscape of tissue repair. Scientists uncovered the potential of diverse cells, such as those found in skin and bone marrow, to transform into brain cells only last year. It appears that our bodies contain a virtually limitless source of replacement cells-which may be exploited if the right signals can be found to stimulate their proper transformation and growth into healthy new tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Society and Gary Sullivan is managing editor of this magazine. // <p>
