2019641 Nothing has ever come easily to Pilgrim Pride founder Bo Pilgrim, which is probably why he keeps outsmarting his rivals. <p> WHEN Lonnie Alfred( Bo) Pilgrim was a young boy and wanted a Coke, his father, who ran the general store in the northeast Texas hamlet of Pine, would first make him sell six Cokes for a nickel apiece to the men working the nearby cotton gin. In 1939, when Bo was 11, his father died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving a widow, seven children and a deeply indebted store. Bo went to work as a farmhand. He later peddled newspapers, raised chickens and hogs, hauled gravel, picked peas and cotton and sacked groceries -- all before he turned 18. <p> Today Bo Pilgrim is a wealthy man. The company he started and runs, Pittsburg, Tex. -based Pilgrim 's Pride Corp., is the country 's fifth-largest chicken processor. His 74% of the $661 million( fiscal 1989 revenues) company is worth $130 million. More satisfying, he 's found a way to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Tyson Foods, and outsmart it. <p> In 1986 Pilgrim 's Pride was enjoying its best year to date : It earned $19 million on $375 million in sales. But Pilgrim knew the prosperity would be transitory, because the company was almost entirely dependent on highly cyclical commodity chicken sales. Twice over the years, commodity chicken downcycles had almost bankrupted Pilgrim 's Pride. <p> To insulate his company from those cycles, Pilgrim decided in 1986 to plow his surging earnings into the prepared chicken market. Prepared chicken is closer to a finished, ready-to-eat product. It is sold to supermarkets and to food service customers -- wholesale distributors like Sysco and Kraft General Foods( which resell it to restaurants, hospitals and the like) and fast-food chains. Unlike commodity chicken, prepared chicken sells mostly on a cost-plus basis. <p> To get into prepared chicken, Pilgrim had to ruffle the feathers of the industry 's biggest producers : Tyson Foods and ConAgra. Both have retail products. But having spent $25 million on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to take on both companies in both the food service and retail markets at once, and get volume up fast. " I never envisioned how difficult it would be, " he says in a twang that reflects a lifetime in rural Texas. " It was like getting on the wrong ski lift. You might wish you had n't done it, but there 's no other way to get back down. " <p> At first, to get food service business, Pilgrim had to price his products below Tyson 's -- at a loss to Pilgrim 's Pride. And in retail it typically takes years to break even on a new product. Pilgrim was spending $6 million to $8 million a year on advertising, promotion and supermarket slotting allowances, but could n't get enough sales volume to cover those costs. <p> But then nothing in Bo Pilgrim 's life has been easy. Pilgrim 's Pride lost about $50 million over three years trying to crack the prepared chicken market, in fiscal 1988( ending Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $506 million in sales. Disgruntled investors dumped the stock ; the value of Bo Pilgrim 's stake shrank by 76%, to $61 million. <p> Pilgrim finally turned the comer with a strategic retreat from the supermarkets and a major advance into the food service market. Retail products now account for a mere 2% of Pilgrim 's Pride 's prepared chicken sales. But in food service he positioned the company as an alternate to Tyson, aimed at those customers leery of being too dependent on one supplier. " A lot of buyers gave us information to help us duplicate the products they were buying from Tyson, " Pilgrim says. With customers such as Kraft General Foods, Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, the company has been able to raise its prices to be in line with Tyson 's. <p> John Bierbusse, an analyst at A.G. Edwards who keeps his eye on Pilgrim 's Pride, reckons the firm will earn around $23 million, $1 a share, this year. Around 20% of Pilgrim 's Pride 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared chicken. Pilgrim says he hopes to get the figure up to 50% eventually. <p> Like Perdue Farms ' Frank Perdue, Bo Pilgrim is working at becoming Pilgrim 's Pride 's best booster. He 's a folksy presence in TV ads, wearing a business suit and a black, buckled pilgrim 's hat atop his silver-white hair. Last year his promotional efforts very nearly got Pilgrim into some serious trouble. Hoping to influence workers ' compensation legislation, Pilgrim buttonholed eight lawmakers on the Texas senate floor, argued his case and handed each a $10,000 check as a " campaign contribution. "( Texas has no limit on personal campaign contributions.) After a public outcry, Pilgrim asked the senators to return the checks ; he had to defend himself before a Travis County grand jury but was never indicted. He later called the incident " a bonehead mistake. " <p> At 62, with his company humming along, Pilgrim still works 12-hour days, taking time out for a daily exercise regimen of treadmill work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago), thrice-weekly Baptist meetings and occasional yard work. His only real indulgence, hesays, is " my wife 's dream house, " to be built at a cost of about $2 million. <p> " People retire too early, " says Pilgrim. " They should retire when they do n't enjoy working anymore. I wo n't retire. " Having started so young, for Pilgrim hard work is a well-ingrained habit. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Preparing chicken parts at Pilgrim 's $25 million Pittsburg, Tex. plant Ruffling the feathers of the big producers, Tyson and ConAgra. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Lonnie Alfred( Bo) Pilgrim with his chicken and the hat he wears in Pilgrim 's Pride commercials " A lot of buyers gave us information to help us duplicate the products that were buying from Tyson.
