4152241 GEMS FROM THE SATURDAY EVENING POST ARCHIVE # 75 YEARS AGO # As the saying goes, everything old is new again : Throughout January 1938, the Post featured multiple articles about the ongoing struggle in Washington to create jobs as America clawed its way out of the Great Depression. The Post also covered the release of two now-classic films, The Adventures of Robin Hood and Bringing Up Baby. Ads for Ford, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac promised a gas-sipping 18 to 24 mpg! This lovely Art Deco cover is by wildlife painter Francis Lee Jacques. #
