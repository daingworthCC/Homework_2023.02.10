4108841 As upheaval rages on its border, Morocco remains an oasis of color and calm -- and modern innovation, as Whitney Robinson discovers on a visit to one man 's North African sanctuary. <p> " The light is why people come to Tangier, " says Yves Taralon. We are sitting on a red-and-white-striped banquette on the highest of his home 's four expansive terraces, which overlooks the Strait of Gibraltar. The sun is beating down on the terra-cotta floor in fat white blocks. <p> Taralon has just returned to Morocco after six months in Paris to show me this coastal city, which was also the inspiration for the new line of china he designed for Herms, where he has been the creative director of the company 's tabletop collection for the past seven years. Named Bleus d'Ailleurs, which is best translated as " blues of elsewhere, " a phrase that is both literal and vaguely exotic, the design borrows its geometric patterns from rustic Fez pottery and its seven shades of blue from the colors of the Bay of Tangier. <p> Taralon has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already traded his city gear for a crisp white shirt, blue linen trousers, and a cashmere sweater the color of the water below. His shoes are gone. I 've ditched mine too. <p> Located in the center of the casbah, Taralon 's riad has been his refuge for the past 20 years. The house unfolds over many floors and levels -- there 's one for living, one for dining, one for sleeping, and one for working. On the bottom level, which is separate from the main house, a Taj Mahal-style arched door reveals a little bedroom intended for afternoon siestas. Full of secret passageways and hidden loggias, this is the kind of fantasy house that reveals itself over time. <p> As we have breakfast on a terrace off the living room -- toast, fresh marmalade with bits of bitter orange rind, butter, coffee -- we have a clear view of the mountainous peaks marking the nearby Spanish coastline. If you peer over the edge of the spilling terrace, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only 30 minutes away by boat, but it might as well be a lifetime. <p> That 's because Tangier has always been a mythical crossroads where Europe, North Africa, and the Arab world meet in a cacophonous clash of color, language, and culture. When Taralon and his cadre of expatriate friends speak about the city, it takes on a mythic quality, the legendary setting of times long gone that were impossibly fun, and probably irreproducible. And while Tangier has shed its reputation as a hedonistic pleasure port and has been undergoing a revival for the last decade, it still feels exotic, apart, even a little dangerous. No matter how many French tourists you encounter in the souk, it 's still a magical part of Africa, one that 's been written about, painted, documented, and sung about by just about everyone. Delacroix, the Beats, Paul Bowles, Tennessee Williams, Matisse, Mick Jagger -- all of these artistic giants found inspiration here. " Paul Bowles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast blue crawling hide of the sea &; we sit silent watching the universe, everybody tranquil, " Allen Ginsberg wrote in a letter to his father on a 1961 visit to Tangier. " This place is more interesting &; weirder to live in &; happier than Paris at the moment for me. " <p> In the afternoon Taralon and I wander the streets in search of the blue-and-white patterns that inspired the intricate designs of Bleus d'Ailleurs. At the Galerie Tindouf, a boutique selling ceramics and art on the Rue de la Libert, we find 19th-century Moroccan butter jars that resemble enormous lidded vases with the same pattern as his salad plates. Taralon winks at me. In Tangier the color combination is everywhere : on the wall of a riad, the two colors splitting apart in dense stripes as if magnetized, effectively cutting the building in half ; in the ever-changing hues of the sea, a glimpse of which always seems to be right around the corner of the next building. <p> Just four doors down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark where the Rolling Stones once sampled the offerings. Three teenagers wearing thin leather bombers and jeans, and smelling of spicy cologne and mint tea, guard the entrance. A tea vendor walks by holding a contraption that contains 50 glasses of the sweet green brew, but he does n't spill a drop. Mint tea is to Morocco what soda is to the U.S., and Taralon orders a round for the table. The sun is going down, and because it 's late February it 's getting a little chilly. The caf is a series of stepped terraces, whitewashed and dotted with potted palms, and around me are hundreds of young Moroccans, all drinking tea and texting. " This is where the young boys and girls come to hold hands away from their parents, " Taralon whispers. <p> Morocco, at the time of my visit, seems surrounded by civil war and unrest : Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, and Yemen are all in the throes of revolt. Egypt 's Hosni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television is full of images of Tahrir Square, once the site of a revolution, now of a citywide celebration. But Morocco, as Jean-Yves Berthault, the consul general of France in Tangier, told me on a visit to the very grand consulate in the center of town, is different. As if speaking for the entire European continent( as consuls general often do), he remarked, " We are shrinking. They are expanding. We can only look and be jealous! " <p> What he was referring to is the dramatic growth Morocco has experienced in the last decade. For years it seemed the only real changes were confined to Marrakech, Tangier 's far more glamorous cousin to the south, or even to Casablanca, the country 's international business capital. This isolated progress had something to do with the previous king 's dismissal of Tangier as a rough-and-tumble commercial port, a place more akin to Marseille than to St.-Tropez. But much of that thinking has changed in the last five years, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying value of Tangier 's strategic location. The 48-year-old Mohammed, who ascended to the throne in 1999 and has a long-standing interest in architecture and design, has initiated new building projects like Tanger-Med, a huge cargo port 25 miles outside Tangier, which will be Africa 's largest commercial port when it is completed in 2015. Tanger-Med 's offices are being designed by architect Jean Nouvel. <p> In the city proper, a new palm-lined corniche snakes directly beneath Caf Hafa, past Taralon 's house, and directly to the passenger dock, where cruise ships ferry tourists from all over the Mediterranean. Thousands of modernist cubic apartment complexes built for Tangier natives line the hills that hug the main road from the airport, and splashy new faux-Arabic villas have sprung up behind the miles of public beaches, which are thickly occupied by Spanish and Italian tourists taking advantage of Morocco 's generous tax abatements for foreigners, cheap real estate, and proximity. Another big project to be completed in 2015 is a high-speed rail line, financed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect Casablanca to Tangier in just under two hours. Paul Bowles-style romance aside, the city today resembles nothing so much as a mini-Dubai, all cranes and bustle and new construction. <p> So is all this progress the source of Morocco 's apparent stability? Not necessarily, says Smith College professor Gregory White, who specializes in North African politics. " Morocco does seem exceptional, but we have to be skeptical of these projects. The port may generate a significant amount of jobs, but it is mostly seen as a way for European investors to get into Africa. " He suggests that Morocco 's relative tranquility is the result of three political factors. First is the extremely charismatic Mohammed VI, who is part of one of the few dynasties in the Arab world that claim direct descent from the prophet Mohammed, which potentially makes it more legitimate in the eyes of the people than, say, a succession of military autocrats. Second is a multiparty parliament in which many of the country 's factions, from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a constitution that has been reformed several times since Morocco won its independence from France in 1956 and is inching the kingdom closer, some suggest, to a Spanish model. <p> The irony is that despite these positive factors, Morocco performs far worse than Tunisia in, for instance, literacy rates, secondary education, and per capita income. Two-thirds of Moroccan women are illiterate. " People are urging Mohammed toward a gradual evolution to the Spanish model, rather than an eventual revolution, " White says. " He 's a relatively young monarch, so it remains to be seen. What 's exceptional is that Morocco has managed to avoid the turmoil that is throughout the region, but I would n't wager that it continues to do so. " <p> It 's getting dark when we return from the caf to Taralon 's house. After an apritif of pastis and champagne, we descend five levels to the dining room, which appears to float on the ocean, just at the horizon line. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake, I hope it stays that way, " Taralon says between bites of a lamb tagine. His comment seems not so much self-serving as wistful, a hope that the dynamic culture that has welcomed people like Taralon and his friends for the greater part of the last century will endure. <p> And indeed, though so much of Morocco has modernized so quickly, Tangier retains much of the atmosphere and artistic heritage it had in the 1960s. For all the billion-dollar infrastructure projects poised to turn this city into a Western gateway to Africa, many things have not changed. This -- the ability to accommodate the generations of artists and writers and dreamers who make pilgrimages here while still remaining wholly itself, a city out of time -- is what makes Tangier what it is. <p> Dinner is finished, and we sit outside in virtual blackness, savoring the last piece of orange-scented cake. " Many people sit and dream of that life, " Taralon says, referring to the mountains across the way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many. Perhaps that 's still true, but something tells me the new Moroccan dream will be to remain closer to home -- his home, a place where everything will always be seen in blue and white. <p> Generations of artistic giants found inspiration in Tangier. " This place is more interesting and happier than Paris at the moment for me, " Allen Ginsberg wrote on a 1961 visit. <p> Morocco, the consul general of France tells me, is different from its neighbors. " We are shrinking. They are expanding. We can only look and be jealous! " <p> Full of secret passageways and hidden loggias, this is the kind of fantasy house that reveals itself over time. <p> Photograph : The beautiful Bleus d'Ailleurs porcelain by Herms mixes with Saint Louis crystal glasses <p> Photograph : a bar setup in the living room <p> Photograph : Taralon 's bedroom wall is lined with vintage American flags <p> Photograph : Taralon resting against a wall in the picturesque seaside town of Assilah <p> Photograph : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table set with Bleus d'Ailleurs and Saint Louis crystal <p> Photograph : Taralon 's riad spills over five separate terraces down to the water and the new corniche <p> Photograph : a traditional Moroccan room, with views of the sea <p>
