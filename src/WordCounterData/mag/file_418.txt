4050741 I AM FULLY AWARE that before long we 'll be tarpon fishing where Popham Beach, Maine, used to be, and that the bananas will be grown near Fairbanks, but in the meanwhile we still have some serious cold weather ahead of us, and you may well be hunting in it. If so, your rifle can give you some ugly surprises, which makes it fortunate that you 're reading this. * Last winter I, who am supposed to know better, found myself hunting on a bitterly cold day with a very nice 7mm/08 that I had heretofore used only in autumn. To keep the icy blast off my aged body, I had on a heavy wool coat with a heavy shirt underneath it-about 6 inches of clothes, all told. And when a deer ran in front of me, I could barely shoulder the rifle and could not get a sight picture. * So this is step one : If you know you 're going to be hunting in real cold, put on everything you plan on wearing long before the actual date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost certain that the stock will be too long. If so, you have a number of options. * No. 1 is to have the recoil pad taken off( assuming it has a recoil pad) and a rubber buttplate screwed on. This will often give you the room you need. If that does n't do it, you can have the stock shortened or even get an alternate cold-weather stock. Tame Your Touchy Trigger When frigid temperatures turn your trigger finger as stiff as a tenpenny nail and the rigid digit is encased in a heavy glove, you are going to have one hell of a time controlling a trigger that weighs less than 3 pounds. For extreme cold, 31.2 pounds is better, and 4 pounds is better still. Putting more weight on a trigger is a job for a gunsmith. The Oil Crisis My eight-cylinder SUV takes 6 quarts of oil because it operates at high speed for long periods of time. My rifles, which do not operate at high speed over long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil on the bolt and can get along fine with no oil at all. Oil in a rifle. any kind, in any amount.is a jam waiting for a cold day to happen. If you have a bolt action that you can disassemble, get a can of Birchwood Casey Gun Scrubber. Take the barreled action out of the stock, take the bolt out of the action, and hose out the trigger. I mean soak that sucker good. Then take the firing pin out of the bolt, blast the pin itself, the cocking piece, safety, firing-pin spring, and the interior of the bolt. Let everything dry and then reassemble without oiling. Semiautos, which jam more than any other action type, keep gunsmiths in beluga caviar and Bentley convertibles. Every year these folks cope with a parade of dirty, oilsoaked, carbon-encrusted gas guns that get cleaned only after they jam at a crucial moment. Levers and pumps can handle a lot more crud before they fail, but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season opens, just to be on the safe side. A gunsmith will fieldstrip the firearm, throw all the parts in a solvent bath, and send ultrasound waves through the whole mess. The Tale of the Tape Hunting in very cold weather almost certainly means hunting in snow, and you may encounter sleet and freezing rain as well. You want, at all costs, to keep frozen water out of your barrel, because it can cause same to blow up when you fire. The way to prevent this is simple : Take a piece of thin tape, such as electrician? fs tape or camo bow tape, and stick it across the muzzle. That way, when you trip and fall into a snowdrift, you will not have a bore filled with white stuff. You can shoot right through the tape and it will not affect anything. Every time I write about this I am severely chastised by somebody claiming that tape over the muzzle will cause either the barrel to burst or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of thin tape across the muzzle has no effect on accuracy. I? fve tested it at the range.and is burst open by the column of air that the bullet pushes ahead of it. Got that? Now you can all write letters about the folly of taping your muzzle. Re-Zero When It? fs Zero Smokeless powder gives extremely uniform performance under a wide range of conditions. It is not, however, going to burn at exactly the same rate in minus-10 weather as it does at 80 degrees. Therefore, it behooves you to check your point of impact when the cold becomes extreme. This applies particularly to handloaders ; what you cooked up in August may not perform the same in December. Find out.or miss.
