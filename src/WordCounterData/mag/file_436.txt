4071341 ' Minimizing the disruption to the national economy may warrant a significant role for conventional fuels during the limited period that new energy sources are being developed and the means for their distribution put in place. " <p> THE NEED TO UPDATE the U.S. 's existing energy policy widely is ac knowledged. Yet, obstacles to change are formidable, including fundamental lack of agreement on national objectives as well as on specific policies needed to achieve them. Let us take up the task one step at a time. <p> There are four major energy objectives on the table : <p> -- Provide adequate supplies of energy. That is basic because a modem society and a growing economy require a large amount of energy. <p> -- Hold down prices. Because energy, especially the cost of gasoline, directly affects so many consumers--and because the daily price is visible--considerable public pressure exists to keep costs low. Moreover, people with modest incomes particularly are hard hit by high or rising energy prices. They often own old motor vehicles( high-polluting " clunkers ") that use disproportionately large amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy from unstable regions. The U.S. imports about 70% of its oil. A large portion comes from the Middle East, former provinces of the Soviet Union. and parts of Africa. Much of the world 's oil supply is transported through a series of " choke points, " which readily can be sabotaged. <p> -- Restrict the production and consumption of forms of energy that generate large amounts of pollution and contribute to global warming. <p> Conflicts among these four objectives are quite apparent and difficult to deal with. Keeping the price of oil low encourages more use, simultaneously contributing to environmental and security concerns. Moreover, low prices of traditional fuels( oil, coal, and natural gas) discourage the development of initially higher costing alternative energy <p> Energy policy is complicated. Curbing oil imports likely will have a negative effect on economic activity, reducing living standards as well as the revenues to finance new energy projects. To the extent that high-polluting coal replaces oil imports, the environmental consequences will be adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development reduces the domestic supply of energy, raising prices of domestic fuels and thus dampening economic growth. <p> An examination of previous experiences with energy policies and practices yields several basic economic conclusions that may help in developing a new energy policy. People will use more energy when it is cheaper and less when it is more expensive. When the price of gasoline rose rapidly in early 2008. American motorists reduced sharply the number of miles they drove. In May 2008, Americans drove 966,000,000 fewer miles than a year earlier. <p> Other important effects flow from changes in prices. Producers of existing energy sources tend to reduce production when the prices they receive for their output decline. Conversely., they tend to raise production when prices go up. Simultaneously. developers and producers of new, nontraditional energy sources will be encouraged to be more active when the prices of competing conventional energy are rising--and they will be discouraged when those prices are declining. <p> In earlier times, demand shills from one energy source to another were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed, the most basic shifts in energy demand over the years occurred when the new energy sources became cheaper than the old. In the 19th century, Americans shifted from using whale oil for household illumination to kerosene when kerosene prices dropped below the corresponding price of whale oil. Whales never became extinct. Shifts in demand occurred not from the pressure of any " save me whales " campaign, but from market forces--which helped to achieve the same objective. <p> In the short ran, many producers and consumers will continue to use existing equipment( say automobiles) even in the face of stiff gasoline price increases, but when they have to replace the equipment, consumers and business me likely to buy more fuel-efficient versions. However, a variety of political factors also can affect energy policy making. <p> In the past, a combination of technological advance and exploration, with strong impacts on the relative costs of different fuel sources, usually was the pacing element in the shift from one energy source to another. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role for government incentives. In recent years, subsidies have advanced new types of fuels, most notably corn-based ethanol--but the Feds giveth and the Feds taketh away. The complexities of the regulatory process have, in recent decades, served as an impenetrable barrier to the construction and operation of new nuclear energy projects : Although citizens never have voted down a nuclear project in the U.S., the byzantine regulatory procedures have resulted hi repeated delays of nuclear initiatives. That constitutes a high barrier to expansion in this extremely capital-intensive portion of the energy sector. <p> No new nuclear power plant has been built in the U.S. since the Shoreham project in New York State--and for good reason. The Long Island Lighting Company( LILCO) had obtained all of the necessary approvals to construct and operate the Shoreham power plant. However, after spending more than $1,000,000,000 to build the facility, LILCO had to tear it down because it was impossible for the company to obtain approval of the required emergency evacuation plan. That negative experience discouraged other utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suffer similar experiences. <p> Wind power has been championed for years--with limited success--as an environmentally-friendly alternative to fossil fuels. A promising project in the Cape Cod region of Massachusetts has been stymied by ostensibly fervent environmentalists because it may reduce the natural beauty of the area. Elsewhere, Wind projects have been opposed because spinning blades may kill some birds. <p> Political leaders often ignore the tradeoffs among the energy policies that they legislate. Thus, rising fuel efficiency requirements for motor vehicles have forced automobile manufacturers to shift from heavy metals such as steel to lighter aluminum. However, producing the lighter cars uses far more electricity than the older models, exacerbating overall energy problems. Moreover, the lighter cars are legs safe than the heavier vehicles in terms of accident and death rates. <p> Many interest groups are involved in making energy, policy, helping to explain the inconsistencies that result. The most visible players include producers of energy, environmental organizations, national security interests, a variety of economic groups, consumers, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken ; reconciliation among them is a huge challenge. For instance, a variety of competing interests exists among energy producers. Companies devoted to conventional fuels compete in the public policy arena against firms developing new energy sources.( At times, these may be different divisions of the same company.) <p> Reducing imports of petroleum favors domestic producers of energy, both conventional and innovative. On the other hand, curbing emissions of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming pits producers of coal, oil, and natural gas against hydroelectric and nuclear generators of electricity as well as those developing innovative energy. sources. Historically, the focus of environmental organizations has been on producers of petroleum, coal, and natural gas. However, many other energy suppliers have aroused the ire of some environmental groups. Their targets have included nuclear installations, hydroelectricity, and wind power. <p> The vulnerability of the U.S. to cutoffs of oil is a serious problem, especially to those who approach energy policy primarily from the viewpoint of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. One positive result is the creation of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The idea is to provide a special supply of oil during a period when imports are disrupted. <p> To a substantial degree, the vague--but frequent--pleas for " energy independence " reflect fundamental worries about national security. In practice, advocates of energy independence frequently join forces with the supporters of groups with morn specific agendas. For example, subsidies to ethanol usually are justified, at least in part, by the need to curtail this nation 's oil imports. To a lesser extent, advocates of new energy sources also tend to cite the desire to reduce the U.S. 's import dependence for oil. <p> Fundamentally, the availability--and prices --of an adequate supply of energy is critical to the national economy. The specific approaches that business and government favor vary. Business leaders tend to support subsidies directed to specific sectors of the economy, preferably the sector containing the industry with which they identify. Farm groups have been effective in obtaining subsidies for the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agriculture than in the rest of the economy. However. a backlash has developed became of the escalation in food prices as farmland is diverted to growing corn for energy rather than for food use. <p> In turn, consumers are affected by changes in the availability and price of energy. The sudden skyrocketing of gasoline prices in early 2008 quickly became a national issue. However, organized consumer groups per se are modest voices in the public policy arena. Other than viscerally opposing higher prices at the pump, they contributed little to the development of specific policy responses. The absence of significant political pressures for direct price controls reflects the continuing memories of the adverse consequences of previous governmental efforts to regulate gasoline prices directly( e.g.. long lines and shortages at gasoline stations), <p> Many scientific organizations also have important stakes in energy policy. Most directly affected are laboratories and institutes that generate the scientific and engineering advances needed to make nontraditional energy sources commercially feasible. They share a general stake in seeing the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their specific interests often diverge and competition can be rigorous. For instance, money allocated to wind projects is not available for work in the solar field--and vice versa. Research and development funding can be morn or less oriented to research, and thus primarily to universities and other nonprofit institutions, or to development, which primarily is the province of profit-seeking private companies. <p> All of the foregoing analysis leads up to the need to develop a new energy policy. We can conjure up an away of alternatives from which decisionmakers can select. <p> The role of the energy policy decisionmaker is quite frustrating. The public can be convinced to support high-minded actions--whether they be conserving energy or cleaning up environmental pollution--but a great many citizens want the costs to be borne by someone else, preferably a large and impersonal institution. <p> In that fight, we offer an array of alternative energy policies. Some are oriented to increasing supply, while others focus on reducing demand. In most cases, some demand-oriented policies could be followed simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to view the energy challenge as requiring the nation to choose exclusively either a demand or a supply approach. Given the challenging nature of the energy problems facing the nation, a combination of both strategies constitutes the most sensible response. <p> The mildest item on our menu is to increase the amount of information on energy conservation available to the public. That means extending the energy labeling program to additional products, appliances, and services. New building construction increasingly is incorporating " green features " such as energy-saving motion detectors and multi-geared toilets. One restraint on this approach is that some of these standards are not economically attractive to the consumers who typically would have to pay a higher initial price when they purchase the mole energy efficient item. Offsetting savings occur as they use the product. However the " payback " segment can extend over a long period of time. <p> Simultaneously, society could spend more to improve highway infrastructure, reducing the amount of gasoline motorists use. Congestion on the roads wastes energy while generating more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget deficits usually limit the practicality of this idea, but improvements in highway construction have been justified under Pros. Barack Obama 's more general economic stimulus program. <p> Predictably, economists urge using market forces( e.g., the price system) to reduce the consumption of energy. Higher energy taxes could recoup some of the revenue lost by other items on the energy policy menu. The most direct government action to reduce energy demand is a substantial increase in the excise taxes on gasoline. This would reduce air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, and hasten the day when new energy sources become commercially feasible. Alternatively. Congress could enact a significant tax on the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. That would discourage the use of fossil fuels and stimulate the production of sources of electricity. <p> L : North to Alaska Many actions could reduce the nation 's vulnerability to foreign geopolitical pressures that reduce the availability of energy from overseas. Several supply-oriented proposals could promote this( and other) energy priorities. An example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore and Alaskan locations. A very small portion( perhaps about 2,000 acres) of the 19,600,000-acre Alaska National Wildlife Reserve( ANWR) is appropriate for oil company activity. That 2,000-acre area is barren, adjacent to the ocean, and devoid of significant amounts of wildlife. <p> The construction of natural gas pipelines from the Arctic to the lower 48 states is another supply-oriented policy. Although it is a foreign nation, Canada, over the years, has been the most secure external source of energy for the U.S. <p> In addition, government financing of R &D; of new energy sources can be increased. Possible alternatives are numerous, including synthetic fuels from coal, hydrogen fuel cells, biodiesel, liquid nitrogen, and geothermal energy. Bringing down the cost of generating and distributing power from the sun or the wind reduces a major deterrent to their widespread commercialization. There is opportunity here for carefully selected Federal financing of basic and applied research. However, it would be up to private companies to invest their own funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Surely, the Federal government could eliminate one of the most serious objections to nuclear power--the lack of long-term storage fur spent fuel. To date, the Feds have not met their commitment to deal with this problem. The cost( including incentives to the localities hosting the spent fuel) could be covered by the utilities shipping the material. Currently, nuclear power generates more than 70% of the nation 's non-CO2 emitting electricity. <p> Another supply-oriented approach is to assure a stable outlook for energy prices by instituting a differential tax on gasoline. It would operate as follows : a target price for gasoline would be set, say three dollars a gallon for regular. When oil prices fail below that level( as they did in late 2008), the tax would fill the gap, bringing the total price at the pump to three dollars. If the price without the new tax is three dollars or higher, the tax would be waived. Investors in new energy sources would be assured that, if they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallon, they would be competitive in U.S. energy markets. <p> Recently, innovative energy projects have been de-emphasized because the price of oil has dropped sharply. Clearly, uncertainty as to the price of conventional energy supplies constitutes a major deterrent to large-scale investments in alternatives. The money generated by the special excise tax could be used for a variety of alternatives : financing tax reductions for low-income people especially hard hit by high energy costs ; paying for the incentives provided to new energy sources ; or reducing the rising budget deficit. <p> Consistent with most of the other approaches is to reduce regulatory obstacles to the exploration and production of energy. If ANWR continues to be off-limits, then the government could open up areas in the lower 48 states that, at present, are not accessible. Likewise, if exploration and production on the outer Continental Shelf off the coasts of Florida and California continue to be prohibited, then production could be expanded from existing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. <p> These proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However, as has been demonstrated, many inconsistencies and overlaps exist among them. Hence, let us try to develop, from these details, three internally consistent alternative energy policy packages that : focus on reducing the U.S. 's vulnerability to sharp reductions in energy imports or huge run-ups in energy prices( or both) ; emphasize curbing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that increase global warming ; and attempt to keep energy prices down, especially for people with low incomes. <p> L : National security concerns Responding to abrupt reductions in energy supplies or rapid increases in energy prices can be justified on national security grounds. Such situations can arise from domestic events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters that disrupt the flow of energy, as well as terrorist actions here or overseas, or unhelpful policy actions on the part of major oil-producing nations. The fundamental protection against such threats is the diversification of energy supplies. Diversification can be viewed in many dimensions, ranging from using fossil fuels( oil, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy sources. These latter sources range from traditional ones such as hydro and nuclear power to newer projects focusing on wind and solar. <p> Certainly, cutting back imports of energy reduces our vulnerability to overseas threats. However, as we have seen in the case of the Katrina aftermath, imports, at times, can substitute for domestic energy facilities which are out of commission temporarily. Reducing the nation 's vulnerability also requires geographic diversification so that dependence on any one region of the country or the world is reduced substantially. A variety of specific supporting actions can be justified by the national security approach. Conservation efforts to reduce the domestic consumption of energy, especially oil, would be quite helpful, as would attempts to reform regulatory and other obstacles to the erection of energy-producing facilities, involving all of the energy sources enumerated earlier. Using the information approach to encourage conservation would be constructive as well. So, too, would relying on the price system to harness market forces that encourage consumers to curb energy use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the notion that higher prices for traditional sources of energy--whether the result of taxation or market forces--will hasten the day that new energy sources become economically attractive and commercially feasible. Thus, as a practical matter, fossil fuel usage would remain high in the short run but decline as innovative types of energy become generally available. Increased government financing of R &D; for new energy sources also would be consistent with this approach. On the other hand, the case for taxing the production of activities that generate CO2 or otherwise increase pollution fits less comfortably into the national security approach. Such taxes, while generating favorable environmental impacts, are likely to affect the productivity of American industry adversely. Negative consequences in terms of reduced employment and living standards likely would result. <p> Alternatively, environmental considerations can be given a central role in the formation of energy policy. Clearly, the conservation approaches designed to reduce the consumption of energy would be most appropriate, as would policy alternatives that encourage the development and production of new energy sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of CO2 and pollution generally. However, the environmental approach to energy policy would not support the development of conventional--and relatively high polluting--energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas( as well as their continued importation). Taxation of CO2 emissions( or the equivalent via a cap and trade system) likely would become a central part of the effort However, many important aspects of the environmental approach to energy policy are in conflict with the national security approach. Sensible energy policy would involve some direct tradeoffs between these objectives. In practice, however, energy and environmental policies each usually have been adopted in isolation with little, if any, consideration of other important objectives of society. For instance, to maximize the availability of energy in the U.S. means freely encouraging imports of all types of energy and from all regions of the globe as well as the production of energy from various domestic sources. Many conservation measures also would help reduce demand and thus keep energy prices low. That effectively rules out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for environmental or other concerns. <p> Several key elements of the energy policy menu seem inherently desirable in terms of prioritizing one or more of the three central objectives while not downgrading the others : diversifying energy sources, encouraging conservation of energy, and maintaining a basic spirit of fairness in government policy affecting the citizenry. <p> Minimizing the disruption to the national economy may warrant a significant role for conventional fuels during the limited period that new energy sources are being developed and the means for their distribution put in place. Over the years, the less-polluting new energy sources would become far more important and the role of high-polluting, traditional energy sources would be reduced or ultimately eliminated. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) <p> By Murray Weidenbaum <p> Murray Weidenbaum, Economics Editor of USA Today, is Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor at Washington University, St. Louis, where he is Honorary Chairman of the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy.
