2023141 Section : UNIVISION SPANISH LANGUAGE NETWORK UNIVISION IS A MEDIUM THAT LINKS HISPANICS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND NATIONALITIES <p> HOW CAN YOU BLEND black beans with white potatoes, Andean grapes with tropical mangos, the bolero and the tango, base ball and soccer, cinnamon and Tabasco sauce? <p> How can you bring together a Puerto Rican who has lived in New York since 1961 with a man from the Dominican Republic who has been driving a taxi in Manhattan for only four years? An Argentine doctor with his Central American patients? Millions of women of all ages and nationalities with Julio Iglesias? Millions of men with Maradona and Jose Canseco? The Pope with his millions of followers, north and south? <p> How can you entertain such a throng, keep it informed, educate it, make it buy, laugh, or weep -- from the plains of Patagonia to the banks of the Rio Grande? Since the early colonial days, it has been all but impossible to treat the peoples of Spanish America, with their widely differing customs, accents, and complexions, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of Univision, the Spanish-language television network " made in the USA, " now broadcast in the United States from coast to coast and soon to be on the air throughout the Hemisphere and in Spain as well. 1961 : Laying the Foundation <p> In 1961, station KWEX-TV( channel 41) in San Antonio, Texas, began to transmit programs in Spanish. Since Texas ' Spanish-speaking population is predominantly of Mexican background, it is not surprising that this early effort catered to the thinking and tastes of that market. Rene Anselmo, a Bostonian, realized better than anyone else at the time what the new immigrant public wanted : soap operas and music that would remind its members of the land they had left behind when they set out in search of a brighter future. <p> Anselmo, currently the president of PANAMSAT, a company which provides satellite communication between Latin America, the United States, and Europe, knew Mexico intimately. He had lived there for eight years and had begun his career in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Voice of America. In addition, while in Mexico he established close relations with Televisa, the enterprise which dominates TV production and transmission in that country. <p> In 1961 Anselmo and his Mexican associates set out to win a market in the United States. Would they be able to expand from Texas to other states? Would other Spanish-speaking communities be attracted by Mexican programs, and would it be possible to get mass advertising for Spanish-language programs? <p> " It was very hard at first, " Anselmo recalls. " We had a lot of trouble interesting large-scale advertisers in this country, owing to ignorance and prejudice against Hispanics. We have no studies of their marketing tastes, ' they would say. We do n't know whether they comb their hair, whether they use deodorants, or whether they brush their teeth every day. ' That was the attitude of many advertisers. We started out transmitting from very rudimentary studios, and our first sponsors were grocery and department store owners who served the immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved ahead, upgrading our programs and making our own market studies to convince unbelievers, " Anselmo concluded, smiling with satisfaction. From SIN to Univision <p> After its experience in San Antonio, the group decided to go for broke. They adopted the name " Spanish International Network "( SIN) and set up offices in New York. Three years later, SIN began broadcasting from station KMEXTV( channel 34) in Los Angeles. Stations in other states came along soon afterwards, and before long SIN was on the air in almost every important Hispanic center in the country. <p> Geographical expansion and broader programming meant that SIN had to accomodate itself to the two other communities which, along with the Mexican-Americans, make up the bulk of Hispanic immigrants to the United States : the Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, especially New York, and the Cubans in the Southeast, concentrated in Miami. These communities broadened the spectrum of programming from a limited fare of soap operas to include the " wide world of sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and archetypes. <p> Two dates stand out in this first period of expansion : 1968, when the presidential election returns were broadcast for the first time in Spanish, and 1970, when SIN was the first television network in the United States to transmit the World Soccer Cup matches live. By 1978, SIN was connected by satellite to 11 stations of its own, ranging from New York to Florida and Texas to California. <p> The success of the network can be attributed to three factors : it broadcasts in Spanish ; it covers the country from north to south and east to west ; and its programming runs the gamut from children 's shows to the very competitive field of news. The three principal Hispanic voices in the U.S. have now been thoroughly integrated into the world of communication in Spanish. They are gradually being joined by representatives from other parts of Central and South America. What began as no more than a commercial venture launched by far-sighted businessmen is now the Spanish-language television network, which aims to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy rivalry of accents and idioms. <p> But the message is n't the only thing that counts in the communications field. Ratings and viewership numbers, sponsors, financing, legal and political factors also have to be taken into consideration. After 27 years of largely Mexican control, SIN 's successes attracted the attention of major investors, and in 1987-88 the network was purchased for $630 million. The buyer was a U.S. consortium composed of Hallmark -- the greeting-card company -- and First Chicago Venture Capital. With the takeover, SIN became Univision. Programming a Balancing Act <p> It takes a special, if not unique, talent to respond to the full range of distinct regional psychologies of Hispanic immigrants. The responsibility has fallen to a woman, the first to have a feel for the whole of the viewing audience -- families, singles, young people, grandparents, coming from all parts of Spanish America. <p> Rosita Peril rules over a realm in which, as if by magic, each member of this widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all famous queens, real or fictitious, Rosita is beautiful, and like queens in fairy tales she can also sing. Indeed, it was as a singer that this Buenos Aires-educated native of Lima started out at SIN. Today, 18 years later, after appearing as an anchor on news programs and as hostess of a show of her own, Rosita Peru is the highest-ranking female in an industry noted for its competitiveness. For eight years she has been the senior vice-president responsible for all programming at Univision. Not surprisingly, she is courted assiduously by each and every Spanish-language program producer. <p> " I have always been deeply concerned for the quality of what goes out on the air, " she says. " Our audience is made up of what means most to us : our families. Our aim in 1990 is to raise our program standards higher and higher. There is a wealth of Latin talent in the United States, lots of it technically trained personnel that can go on to big success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced here in the United States-in Spanish, of course. Another 34 percent originate in Mexico, and 24 percent come from the rest of Latin America. U.S. production will increase enormously once our new studios in Miami are ready. They 'll be the biggest in the country. " Peril continues : " Our commitment to reach increasingly high levels of programming is evinced by the success of our long-standing regular shows, as well as the numerous music and current events specials we air. " <p> As for sports, she says, " Recently when we telecast the World Soccer Cup matches live from Italy, in addition to our studio staff in Laguna Niguel, California, we had special reporters on the scene in Europe. Each telecast had an average audience rating of 38. At times we reached peaks of 51. If you consider that an audience rating of 51 represents 3,500,000 households, I do n't see how you can call that anything but success. " <p> Asked about Univision 's penetration into Latin America, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market our product there, and I 'm happy to say that our labors of love can now be seen on television in more than 15 countries. This gives us double satisfaction, for we know that Latin Americans who travel back and forth between the U.S. and their native countries can now see many favorite Univision programs on their hometown screens. This strengthens cultural bonds among us. " She adds, " We also have some highly ambitious plans for broader presentation on TV in Spain. " As for new areas of emphasis, " We are going to give special attention to the world of children, a market in which we are already working actively. We will continue with the specials that have been so successful, such as our Latin music prize contest and our beauty contest. And of course we 'll continue turning out the soap operas that have made Univision the favorite network of countless women and indeed whole families. " <p> Rosita is a woman of tireless energy, seemingly born for television. Eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the industry that was still in its infancy ; today she is a force to be reckoned with. Her decisions have the potential to reach the entire Latin American population in the United States, which now numbers between 20 and 22 million people. Their buying power -- currently at $130 billion a year -- is the fastest-growing of all minority populations in the U.S. The Visionary at Univision <p> If Rosita Peru is the heartbeat of Univision, then Joaquin Blaya is its brain. President of the company since 1988, Blaya has spent more than 25 years in the television industry. The 44-year-old entrepreneur was born in Santiago, Chile to a family of newsmen. His grandfather ran an illustrated magazine and was a well-known columnist, and his father put together an FM radio network. Joaquin, however, decided on a career in television, starting out in 1970 as an account executive in SIN 's head office in New York City. This brought him into direct -- and indispensable -- contact both with clients and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament led him toward the production area, which was then an open field. It was the moment to test his talent. <p> After two years he decided to move to Miami, where he pursued a successful career with SIN-associate WLTV( channel 23). In 17 years, first as East Coast manager and then as president, Blaya made WLTV the number-one channel for the Spanish-language market ; the station won more than 100 Emmy awards during his stewardship. In Miami, he became the driving force behind Sabado Gigante( a combination game show and pop-singer contest), which tops the list for the Spanish viewing audience, capturing 44 percent or about 2,400,000 households. He also promoted TV Mujer, a morning show aimed at women throughout the country ; Cristina, a talk show often compared to Oprah Winfrey 's ; and most notably Noticiero Univision, generally considered the best Spanish news program anywhere, with foreign correspondents providing live coverage of the most important events worldwide. When SIN was purchased in 1988, Blaya was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of president of the Univision network. <p> 1990 was marked by a banner event for Blaya -- live coverage of the World Soccer Cup matches in Italy. For a month the network had more than 6,000,000 spectators over the age of 18 hanging in suspense, a number far exceeding all expectations for the United States. <p> " We are very proud of the results achieved by our coverage, " says Blaya. " The success of the telecasts of the World Cup matches was foreseen commercially six months in advance. By that time we had already sold all the advertising slots available. Univision is happy it was able to bring the best in world soccer to our audience. We are happy too to know that, thanks to our satellite hook-up and cable systems, we now reach 89 percent of the Hispanic households in the United States. " <p> The father of five children, Blaya also has community concerns which have led him to emphasize the problems of Hispanic minorities in the newsmagazine program known as Portada( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the network 's co-sponsoring of the international song-contest program Festival OTI de la Cancion, which is a great public favorite. Blaya thinks Spanish-language television has now come of age -- as he said to a Newsweek interviewer, " Univision is watchable. " The Future <p> Unquestionably Univision has fulfilled all of its creators ' dreams, far exceeding the hopes they entertained at its birth in 1961. If the road to commercial success was rough, the success achieved has been remarkable. Currently Univision has affiliates in San Antonio, Albuquerque, Dallas, Fresno, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Phoenix, and San Francisco. Its programs are also carried by stations in Tucson, Austin, Hartford, Philadelphia, Chicago, Corpus Christi, El Paso-Juarez, Houston, Reno, Las Vegas, and Denver ; in addition, Univision can be reached on cable in more than 500 locations. The network now counts among its advertisers some of the most important firms in the United States, including Proctor and Gamble, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Coors, American Home Products, Scott Paper, Johnson &; Johnson, Miller 's, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, Campbell 's Soup, Budweiser, and Kraft, to name but a few. <p> The new studios being built in Miami represent an all-out gamble on the future. Scheduled to open in late 1990, they cover almost four city blocks near the Doral Country Club -- 5,500 square meters devoted to offices and 6,800 square meters for studios and production facilities. The staff is drawn from all parts of Latin America, from the Chilean president and the Peruvian program director at the top, down through the ranks of news reporters, cameramen, technicians, and artists to the maintenance and cleaning crews. It also includes U.S.-born personnel, who have found better professional opportunities at Univision than in English-language television. <p> They do a good job and the result is apparent on the TV screen. First-generation Hispanic immigrants feel that Univision is " their " network. Though they may now be citizens of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and their differences from Anglo society which they are anxious to preserve. Their descendants, a generation educated in U.S. schools and constantly exposed to U.S. culture, represent the next challenge of a totally bilingual-bicultural market. No doubt Univision will successfully plug into this hybrid audience as well, projecting new images on an ever-widening wave-length. <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : Univision success can be attributed in part to its wide variety of programming. Clockwise from bottom opposite page, these range from special music shows such as the annual OTI Internacional competition and Premio Lo Nuestro, to entertainment such as Desde Hollywood, talk shows with popular personality Cristina, soap operas such as Amanda Sabater, game/variety show Sabado Gigante, and the dynamic Noticiero Univision, considered one of the best Spanish news programs in the world <p> PHOTOS( BLACK &; WHITE) : Univision has been energized by two dynamic individuals.

Teletypes and fax machines are running at top speed ; phones are ringing everywhere ; Federal Express messengers scurry in and out -- the whole battery of modern communications facilities is in full evidence. Satellites and microwaves can not be seen, but one can sense their presence on taking the elevator to the sixth floor of this functionally efficient modern building. <p> In Suite 601-G, I am met by a woman in her mid-thirties, impeccably dressed in the prevailing Washington, D, C., business style -- a blue gabardine tailored suit and a white silk blouse. Her expression is calm, but she has the alert look and the carefully calculated gestures typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give me the time I need, but not a minute more. Time is measured not only in money but also in bits of information. The woman 's name is Deborah Durham. She was born in Massachusetts and is the head of the Washington bureau of Univision 's news service. <p> " I 've been with the network for nine years and feel completely at home working in another language among people who have come from all parts of Latin America to do what they know best -- TV journalism, " says Miss Durham. " I work with the Hispanic network as a matter of choice. I feel its news service is the professional equal of any of its English-language counterparts. We 're more inclined to be go-getters and in some ways we 're better informed. And we 're first on the scene of events. " She can say this with assurance because she previously worked six years for the highly regarded Public Broadcasting System, and she has taught communications at Hartford University ' in Connecticut. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene, I 'm talking facts. When the Berlin wall came down, when they had elections in Panama, when the invasion took place there, we had reporters and cameramen on the spot right from the start. Our Central American correspondent, Monica Seoane, got an exclusive interview from General Noriega before any U.S. network did, and you know how important Noriega was from the public-opinion standpoint in this country. Events in El. Salvador and Nicaragua, the war against the Colombian drug cartel, the elections in Chile and Argentina -- everything that happens in Latin America shows up on our news broadcasts, monitored live by our own correspondents. I mentioned the Berlin wall first to show that we are not concerned with news of Hispanic interest alone, but that we try to be truly worldwide in our coverage. " <p> " I have a staff of 18 working for me -- reporters and cameramen from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same nationality. And yet as you know the news program comes out every day, all in Spanish, and in perfect harmony, " says this lively, bicultural newswoman. <p> " What would you suggest as a closing message to the TV audience and your colleagues in the English-language networks? " I asked just before taking my leave. She gave me a warm smile and, with the assurance of an Olympic finalist, replied : " We are now one of the big five : ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN... and Univision.
