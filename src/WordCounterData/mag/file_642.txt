4146341 NATURALIST AT LARGE # Visiting the sites, from Italy to New Jersey, that reveal extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous Period # The hill town of Gubbio, about a hundred miles north of Rome, Italy, might be described as a municipal fossil. Its streets are so narrow that on many of them not even the tiniest Fiat has room to maneuver, and its gray stone piazzas look much as they did in Dante 's era.( In fact, it was a powerful Gubbian, installed as lord mayor of Florence, who engineered Dante 's exile, in 1302.) If you visit in winter, as I did, when the tourists are gone, the hotels shuttered, and the town 's picture-book palace deserted, it almost seems as if Gubbio has fallen under a spell and is waiting to be awoken. # Just beyond the edge of town a narrow gorge, known as the Gola del Bottaccione, leads off to the northeast. The walls of the gorge consist of bands of limestone that run in diagonal stripes. Long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a clear, blue sea. The remains of tiny marine creatures rained down on the floor of that sea, building up year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium. In the uplift that created the Apennine Mountains, the limestone was elevated and tilted at a forty-five-degree angle. To walk up the gorge today is thus to travel, layer by layer, through time. In the space of a few hundred yards, you can cover almost a hundred million years. # TABLE # The Gola del Bottaccione is now a tourist destination in its own right, though for a more specialized crowd. It is here that in the late 1970s, a geologist named Walter Alvarez, who had come to study the origins of the Apennines, ended up, more or less by accident, re writing the history of life. In the gorge, he discovered the first traces of the giant asteroid that ended the Cretaceous period and caused what may have been the worst day ever on planet Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as figurative--had settled, some three-quarters of all species had been wiped out. # The evidence of the asteroid 's impact lies in a thin layer of clay about halfway up the gorge. Sightseers can park at a turnoff constructed nearby. There 's also a little kiosk explaining, in Italian, the site 's significance. The clay layer is easy to spot. It 's been gouged out by hundreds of fingers, a bit like the toes of the bronze St. Peter in Rome, worn down by the kisses of pilgrims. The day I visited was gray and blustery, and I had the place to myself. I wondered what had prompted all that fingering. Was it simple curiosity? A form of geologic rubbernecking? Or was it something more empathetic : the desire to make contact--however attenuated--with a lost world? I, too, of course, had to stick my finger in. I poked around in the groove and scraped out a pebble-size piece of clay. It was the color of worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in an old candy wrapper and stuck it in my pocket--my own little chunk of planetary disaster. # Walter Alvarez came from a long line of distinguished scientists. His great-grandfather and grandfather were both noted physicians, and his father, Luis, was a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. But it was his mother who took him for long walks in the Berkeley hills and got him interested in geology. Walter attended graduate school at Princeton, then went to work for the oil industry. A few years later he got a research post at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, in Palisades, New York, at a time when the " plate tectonics revolution " was sweeping through his profession. # TABLE # Alvarez decided to try to figure out how, on the basis of plate tectonics, the Italian peninsula had come into being. Key to the project was a kind of reddish limestone, known as the scaglia rossa, which can be found, among other places, in the Gola del Bottaccione @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted direction. " In science, sometimes it 's better to be lucky than smart, " he would later say of these events. Eventually, he found himself working in Gubbio with an Italian geologist named Isabella Premoli Silva, who was an expert on foraminifera, or forams, tiny marine creatures that create little calcite shells. Forams tend to be widely distributed and abundantly preserved, and this makes them extremely useful as index fossils to date rocks. As they worked their way up the Gola del Bottaccione, Silva pointed out to Alvarez a curious sequence. The limestone from the last stage of the Cretaceous period contained diverse, abundant, and relatively large forams, many as big as grains of sand. Directly above that, there was a layer of clay about half an inch thick with no forams in it. Above the clay there was limestone with more forams, but these belonged to only a handful of species, all of them very tiny and all totally different from the larger ones below. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very abrupt. " Then there was the odd matter of timing. The king-size forams appeared to vanish right around the point the last of the dinosaurs were known to have died off. This struck Alvarez as more than just a coincidence. # In 1977, Alvarez got a job at Berkeley, where his father, Luis, was still working, and he brought with him to California his samples from Gubbio. While Walter had been studying plate tectonics, Luis had won the solo 1968 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to elementary particle physics. When Walter told his father about the puzzle from Gubbio, Luis was fascinated. It was Luis who came up with the wild idea of clocking the clay using the element iridium, which led them to discover that the amount of iridium( rare on the surface of the Earth but much more common in meteorites) in the clay layer was off the charts, about 600 times richer in iridium than the surrounding sediment. # Almost a year later, after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis, ultimately leading, in the early 1990s, to the rediscovery and dating of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula. On an otherwise ordinary day sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid six miles wide collided with the earth. Exploding on contact, it released energy on the order of a hundred million megatons of TNT, or more than a million of the most powerful H-bombs ever tested. Debris, including iridium from the pulverized asteroid, spread around the globe. Day turned to night, and temperatures plunged. A mass extinction ensued and separated the Cretaceous Period from the Tertiary Period. This abrupt, catastrophic discontinuity is called the K-T boundary( also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, boundary). # Today there are dozens of known sites where the iridium layer is exposed, including one near a nude beach in Biarritz, another in the Tunisian desert, and a third in suburban New Jersey. Neil Landman, a paleontologist who specializes in ammonites, often takes field trips to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to tag along. We met in front of the American Museum of Natural History, in Manhattan, where Landman has his office in a turret overlooking Central Park, and, together with a pair of graduate students, headed south to the Lincoln Tunnel. # TABLE # In the general vicinity of Princeton, we pulled into a parking lot next to a baseball field.( Landman would prefer that I not reveal the exact location of the field, for fear of attracting fossil collectors.) In the parking lot, we met up with a geologist named Matt Garb, who teaches at Brooklyn College. We struck out through the underbrush. Soon we reached a shallow creek. Its banks were covered in rust-colored slime. Brambles hung over the water. Fluttering from these were tattered banners of debris : lost plastic bags, scraps of newspaper, the rings from ancient six-packs. " To me, this is better than Gubbio, " Landman announced. # Landman pointed to a spot in the creek bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me, was the iridium layer. Although it was n't in any way visibly different, Landman knew where it was because he 'd had the sequence analyzed a few years earlier. Landman is stocky, with a wide face and a graying beard. He had dressed for the trip in khaki shorts and old sneakers. He waded into the creek to join the others, who were already hacking at the bed with their pickaxes. Soon, someone found a fossilized shark 's tooth. Someone else dug out a piece of an ammonite. It was about the size of a strawberry and covered in little pimples, or tubercles. Landman identified it as belonging to the species Discoscaphites iris. # Ammonites floated through the world 's shallow oceans for more than three hundred million years, and their fossilized shells turn up all around the world. Pliny the Elder, who died in the eruption that buried Pompeii, was already familiar with them, although he considered them to be precious stones. Like nautiluses, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into multiple chambers. The animals themselves occupied only the last and largest chamber ; the rest were filled with air, an arrangement that might be compared to an apartment building in which just the penthouse is rented. The walls between the chambers, known as septa, were fantastically elaborate, folded into intricate ruffles, like the edges of a snowflake. That evolutionary development allowed ammonites to build shells that were at once light and robust--capable of withstanding many atmospheres ' worth of water pressure. Most ammonites could fit in a human hand ; some grew to be the size of kiddie pools. # Based on the number of teeth ammonites had--nine--it 's believed that their closest living kin are octopuses. But since ammonites ' soft body parts are virtually never preserved, what exactly the animals looked like and how they lived are largely matters of inference. It 's probable, though not certain, that they propelled themselves by shooting out a jet of water, which means that they could only travel backward. # In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of ammonite. One of these he named, in honor of a colleague, Discoscaphites minardi. The other he named, in honor of the place, Discoscaphites jerseyensis. Discoscaphites jerseyensis probably had little spines poking out of its shell, which, Landman speculates, helped the animal appear larger and more intimidating than it actually was. # Landman, Garb, and their graduate students chipped away at the creek bed all morning. Although we were in the middle of the country 's most densely populated state, not a single person passed by to wonder at what we were doing. Someone had brought along an empty cardboard box, and, since I did n't have a pickax, I helped out by gathering up the fossils the others had found and arranging them in the box. Several more bits of Discoscaphites iris turned up, as well as pieces of an ammonite, Eubaculites carinatus, which, instead of having a spiral shell, had one that was long and slender and shaped like a spear. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement. He was carrying a fist-sized chunk of the creek bed and pointed out to me, along one edge, what looked like a tiny fingernail. This, he explained, was a piece of an ammonite 's jaw. Ammonite jaws are more common than other body parts but still extremely rare. " It was worth the trip just for that, " he exclaimed. # It 's unclear what aspect of the impact--the heat, the darkness, the cold, the change in water chemistry--did in the ammonites, but not nautiluses. One theory of the disparity starts with eggs. Ammonites produced very tiny eggs, only a few hundredths of an inch across. The resulting hatchlings, or ammonitellae, had no means of locomotion ; they just floated near the surface of the water, drifting along with the current. Nautiluses, for their part, lay very large eggs, among the largest of all invertebrates, nearly an inch in diameter. Hatchling nautiluses emerge, after nearly a year 's gestation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for food in the depths. Perhaps in the aftermath of the impact, conditions at the ocean surface were so toxic that ammonitellae could not survive, while lower down in the water column the situation was less dire, so juvenile nautiluses managed to endure. # Whatever the explanation, the contrasting fate of the two groups raises a key point. Everything( and everyone) alive today is descended from an organism that somehow survived the impact. But it does not follow from this that they( or we) are any better adapted. In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning : how could a creature be adapted, either well or ill, to conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history? Traits that for many millions of years were advantageous all of a sudden become lethal( though it may be difficult, millions of years after the fact, to identify just ' what those traits were). # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landman told me as we packed up the last fossils from the creek and prepared to head back to New York. " Their hatchlings would have been like plankton, which for all of their existence would have been terrific. What better way to get around and distribute the species? Yet here, in the end, it may well have been their undoing. " # TABLE # This article was excerpted from The Sixth Extinction : An Unnatural History( Henry Holt, 2014). #
