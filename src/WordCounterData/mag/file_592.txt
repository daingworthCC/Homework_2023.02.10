4139741 Her music left her fans with the idea that here was a confident and self-assured woman. Nothing could have been further from the truth # india.Arie 's skin glowed as she commanded the stage at the 2012 Black Girls Rock! Awards in New York City last October. Looking regal in a simple floor-skimming white tank dress and white head wrap, she dedicated her song to " the Black girls all around the world, " who she wanted to know that " it 's not about what you have or what you do. You 're not your body, you 're not your hair, you 're the soul that lives within. " As the 37-year-old singer-songwriter launched into her hit " I Am Not My Hair, " the crowd sang along, and it became clear why so many Black girls have rocked with India. Arie since she first sang about self-acceptance in " Video, " off her first album, 2001 's Acoustic Soul. " India.Arie 's appeal is that she 's me, she 's you, she 's us, " says Gail Mitchell, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's somebody you can touch and feel because she is sharing what she 's gone through. " # Indeed, " Video " and cuts like " Ready for Love, " " Brown Skin " and the self-affirming " Strength, Courage and Wisdom " helped Acoustic Soul become one of the most lauded releases of 2001. Arie 's uplifting lyrics and acoustic guitar playing encompassed both R&amp;B and folk, and positioned her along with Jill Scott and Musiq Soulchild as the leading lights of the burgeoning neosoul movement. But, Arie now reveals, " Musically, Acoustic Soul was n't who I was as an artist or a person. " # LIVING A LIE # the Atlanta-based artist had spent two years working on her debut soon after signing with Motown Records in 1999. Arie says she had written about ten songs for the album when she learned the label had something else in mind for her career. " They kept saying, " This is n't going to work, ' " she recalls. " They kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soul ended up being a distorted version of how I saw myself. " # The singer had intended for her music to span genres, saying she wanted to sound like " a cross between Stevie Wonder and James Taylor, a soulful singer with a folk edge who talked about spiritual principles and ideals. " Fellow singer--songwriter Anthony David, who 's known Arie since she was 17, says the folk influence was definitely there. " Before she got on Motown, she was performing locally, and a lot of people would immediately compare her to Tracy Chapman, " he remembers. Yet even as Acoustic Soul with its accept-me-as-I-am message climbed the charts, Arie 's label was reworking her image into one deemed to be more marketable. " Basically, I was told that whatever this neosoul thing was, I needed to fit into it, " says Arie. # The singer kept many of her objections to herself and got back to work, releasing her multiplatinum follow-up, Voyage to India, in September 2002. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But the bigger Arie was becoming, the more she questioned whether she was being true to herself and the vision she held for her music. " It was so hard, " she recalls. " How do I be the real me and find a way to reconcile that with this other life that I had stepped into? I had no one to talk to about it and I just felt sad for years. " # The mounting pressure from her management team and her mother, Joyce Simpson--who also served as her stylist--did n't help. " I was constantly reminded to never look unbeautiful, never say the wrong thing, " Arie says. While she and her mom have a very close relationship--Arie calls Simpson " my backbone " --there were a few arguments over the direction of Arie 's career. Simpson, 63, had turned down a Motown singing deal of her own when she was 17, after a friend convinced her she would n't want the hard life of a recording artist. She admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but says she just wanted her to take advantage of all the opportunities coming her way. " We fought about what she should wear, about her hair and about which songs to put on the album, " Simpson says, adding that there were times she thought her daughter should have included songs that would give her " street cred " or worn clothes that showed off " her cute little bod " and " amazing legs. " # With all the tension, Arie 's body began showing signs of stress. Her skin, which had been flawless, began to break out. She experienced severe back pains, developed ulcers and had a recurring case of strep throat. She began to notice that she got sick every time she " let fear take over " and avoided addressing uncomfortable situations head-on. The singer who had made her name teaching others to claim their power felt she had relinquished hers. " I felt diminished creatively and spiritually, " she says. # By late summer 2006, Arie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was being pushed into taking a three-episode guest-starring role on Girlfriends. Although she says the show was her favorite, Arie was emotionally and physically exhausted at that point. " I knew I could n't do it, but I did n't feel empowered to say no, " she says. " I needed support, I needed my mom to see that I was broken down, but all I got from her was, ' Look at what you have going for you. ' " Her mother, who had a **26;1908;TOOLONG attitude, would n't let up and Arie got more and more frustrated. Finally, she erupted. " I snapped, " Arie admits. " I threw stuff, slammed my phone down, and my mom says I cursed, which I do, but never at her. " # A month later Arie was in San Francisco on tour when her back pains reached an alarming level. Unable to sit on an airplane for long periods of time, she canceled the European leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles home of her friend, singer Rachelle Ferrell. " I cried a lot and really just started looking at everything, " the songstress recalls. She returned to Atlanta and took an extended break from music. " I did n't even go as far as my porch for a month, " she says. " I just wanted to not think about work ; my spiritual faculties were so overloaded. " # Born of necessity and turmoil, the new album is the happiest record Arie has made to date. # REDISCOVERING HER TRUTH # during this time Arie decided to relax the stringent health-conscious diet she had observed since childhood and indulged in breads, cheesy foods and chocolate-covered delights. She soon went from a size 6 to a 12. " I liked my curves, " she says, describing her physique at the time as " womanly. " But months later, when she struggled to pull on her pants, she became conscious of just how many extra pounds she had put on. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa to celebrate the opening of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in January 2007. While there, she attended a New Year 's Eve party hosted by Winfrey, where she was asked to give an impromptu performance. Arie, still recovering from her exhaustion and self-conscious about her weight, openly expressed her nervousness before performing a medley of her songs. The crowd ate it up. Afterward, Arie recalls, icons like Oprah herself and Tina Turner offered encouragement. But it was Cicely Tyson 's wise words that put everything in perspective. The 79-year-old screen legend took Arie aside and talked to her about the difference between approaching her craft with the goal of appeasing people and approaching her craft as a spiritual process. " That conversation is when it started to become clear that I needed to embrace my spirituality, " Arie says now. " It 's the biggest part of me, and I had squashed it for the sake of just trying to fit in. " # By the time she returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She did actually quit Motown briefly, but was coaxed back after just two weeks when her management arranged for her to move to Motown 's sister label Universal Republic Music, which was overseen by executives Arie felt would be more sympathetic to her style. Over the next two years Arie formed a partnership with Universal to launch her own indie label, Soul Bird Music. But when Arie 's fourth album, Testimony : Vol. 2, Love &amp; Politics, released by Universal in 2009, sold only 325,000 copies, the singer became angered by what she felt was the label 's failure to promote the music properly. Later that summer, when she opened for John Legend on his U.S. tour, her emotional tailspin was full-blown. " I did 44 shows in 60 days, which is a lot, " she says. " I did a show in Atlanta, and after my intro, I came out and the crowd barely responded. I had money stolen from me at one point, I had throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy place. " # Following the tour, Arie reflected on her ten years in the music industry. " I realized that I needed to reclaim my spiritual motivation to make music, " she recalls. " I had done everything that I was told to do, and while, yes, even though I had success, had a number one record, it all still did n't feel right. " So Arie parted ways with several members of her business team, including her manager, Noreen Nalli, and a day later took off to a rustic, oceanfront house on a small island in the Pacific Northwest. She spent a month there meditating and journaling. " I asked Spirit to show me what I needed to do, to talk to me, because Spirit will always show you if you ask, " she says. And then she had an epiphany. " I realized that I had never taken the chance to follow the voice of my soul, telling me how to navigate my music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally ready to listen. # A few weeks later Arie felt guided to collaborate with Idan Raichel, a singer--songwriter she had met during a trip to Israel in 2008 and whom she has called her " musical soul mate. " Beginning in 2009 the pair set about writing songs and making music that Arie referred to in her blog( soulbirdmusic.com) as " the MOST authentic musical expression of my life so far. " Arie also returned to a more disciplined lifestyle, ditching carbs, sweets and processed foods in favor of fresh fruits, vegetables and other whole foods. " I wanted to do right by my body so that I would feel good, " she says. " I started out just wanting to shed pounds but ended up wanting to heal all the things that were out of balance. " Yoga became her exercise of choice. # It seemed that finally Arie would be able to express her truest self, but life had a few more challenges in store. Her former manager, Nalli, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice and was owed back pay and that Arie had sabotaged her own career by missing concert dates, causing them both to lose money. Arie countersued, claiming Nalli had been overpaid. The suits were eventually settled in April 2012 for undisclosed terms. Then in October 2012, Arie announced on Twitter that Open Door, the project she and Raichel had labored over for nearly three years and into which she 'd poured " hundreds of thousands " of her own money, had been shelved. When contacted by ESSENCE, Raichel declined to comment on the collapse of the project. Arie also refuses to share details, saying only that she felt she was being pushed in a direction she did n't want to go. # " This was the same lesson I had faced before, " Arie says now. " I could choose to give away my power so that I could have this album, or I could choose to keep my power and figure it out. That realization shifted the way I handled the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have struggled to recover emotionally from such a blow ; this time she simply let it go. " I do n't feel defeated or thrown off-track, " she says of the end of her collaboration with Raichel. " This is one of the most empowering moments I 've ever had. " # Fully reclaiming her power to direct her fate, Arie returned to the studio and spent the next nine months writing and recording a brand-new album. Born of necessity and turmoil, Song Versation, which drops June 25, is the happiest record India. Arie has made to date. And that, says the singer, is no accident. " Black women are expected to live inside a certain box, " she says thoughtfully. " If you 're outside that box, people do n't understand you. For me, this album is about really knowing that I can be me and I do n't have to have this conversation about everyone liking what I do. I had to build my own box. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win a copy of India. Arie 's SongVersation. For full details and rules, go to **25;1936;TOOLONG. The giveaway begins June 25, 2013, at 12 P.M.
