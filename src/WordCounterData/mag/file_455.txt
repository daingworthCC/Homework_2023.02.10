4074941... that 's how long these families have been reading GH. Here, their surprising stories of how the magazine has made a difference in their lives THE MILLERS reading since 1934 " I love baking because I get to spend time with my family -- and I get to eat! " exclaims Valarie Corbella, 10. " It 's so much fun! " Maybe it 's in her genes : Her California clan has been baking Good Housekeeping desserts since 1934, when matriarch Winona Miller, now 93, subscribed. " I was 17, just married, and did n't know how to cook. GHaided me in my new life. " Kitchen wisdom Her family 's fascination with GH recipes has ramped up over the years. " Now we get together regularly and bake GH cookies -- gingerbread, sugar, peanut butter -- or make cupcakes and frost them with the little ones, " Winona says. The holidays have always been prime kitchen time : " Grammie used to spread out GH holiday issues on her coffee table like a deck of cards, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost the sweets, " her granddaughter Glynis Buschmann, 46, remembers. A girls ' guide " I 'm thankful for more than GH 's recipes, " says Marcia Baker, 71, one of Winona 's daughters. " When my daughter Glynis was 11, she came into the kitchen one morning wearing blush. Now, I 'm not a makeup person ; she learned how to put it on from the magazine. " GH also helped out in the dating department : After Glynis 's boyfriend, Clark Buschmann, tasted her favorite GH recipe( the February 1952 Silver White Cake with butter frosting*), he said, " You bake the best treats. I think I 'll have to keep you around! " They were married in 2002. Not that we 're taking credit or anything. THE CAHILLS reading since 1942 When Angelica Cahill, now 85, was growing up in Buenos Aires, yearning to live in America, Good Housekeeping fueled her daydreams. The recipes, the clothes, and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved here in the late 1940s. Ironically, she married an American diplomat whose job took the family( six kids!) to such far-flung spots as Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka, but Angelica 's love affair with the U.S. remained strong. American as pie During those years abroad, Good Housekeeping became the Cahill family 's intercontinental lifeline. " It was the slice of Americana that we did n't have -- and were missing so badly, " explains Angelica 's youngest daughter, Madeleine Cahill-Gabriele, 45. " Since we were eating mostly curries and rice, we sat and drooled over the pictures of GH cakes, casseroles, and cookies. And when the Christmas issue with the gingerbread houses on the cover arrived in the mail, it was absolute magic. " Garden variety Settled in Virginia now, the Cahills are still reading -- but not just the recipes. Irene, 47, is the clan 's green thumb ; she 's usually first to test-drive the gardening tips : " When Good Housekeeping said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trusted it. I thought, Wait, I can make topsoil from leaves and extra lettuce? That 's incredible. Now I 'm the composting queen. " Good( enough) organizing And the GH tradition has been passed to the next generation : Angelica 's granddaughter, Ashley, 24, admits she 's " pretty messy, " so her grandmother and aunt put stickies on the Good Housekeeping pages with decluttering ideas and send the issues to her. " I 'm like, ' OK, guys, I get it. ' I try to put the organizing tips into practice ; they do help. " " I read it in bed after a long day -- that 's when I relax. It 's quiet time. It 's me time. It 's my GH time " -- Irene Cahill THE BROWNS reading since 1905 " To me, GH is the magazine that got delivered in a bucket, " says Laura Breckenridge, 48. That 's how she used to bring it to her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living on the third floor of Laura 's childhood home. " We hung a bucket from the top of the stairwell down to the first floor. Since Grandma Sue had trouble with the stairs, we 'd put what she wanted in the bucket and she 'd pull it up. She always wanted GH. " Cracking up Sue Brown 's twin girls, Emma Sue Wing and Mary Ann Parrish, 84, have been reading GH nonstop since they were 15. " Once we read that if you rinsed your hair with egg, it would shine, " explains Mary Ann. " So we cracked one over Emma Sue 's head. Turns out we did n't read carefully : You were just supposed to use the white. She had egg in her hair for weeks! We still laugh about that. " DIY divas Once they had families, the sisters pored over GH 's pages for craft ideas. Recalls Emma Sue 's daughter Laura : " It was fun making gift wrap from brown paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 18, reads GH, too : " I love the at-home workouts ; they 're great for my hectic schedule. " THE HOLMESES reading since 1982 Style maven Tyny Holmes, 50, first discovered GH as a student at New York 's Fashion Institute of Technology in the early 1980s ; her professors often used the magazine as a fashion resource. After she graduated, Tyny subscribed -- " I did n't want to miss any of the fashion coverage " -- and now sister Vicky Smith, 49, and daughter Alivia Nicole Holmes, 30, ca n't resist reading it, either. Have GH, will travel Since all three live in New York City, they always tote along an issue of GH while commuting. " I have to have it on the train or bus, " says Tyny. " It helps me relax in an otherwise stressful situation. " Unfortunately, she sometimes relaxes too much : " I 've missed my stop more than a few times because I 've been so involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she laughs. Sealing the deal " We always tell one another about the latest products we try -- especially the ones with the Seal, " says Tyny. The whole family likes the Seal, partly because it 's a money saver : " If you buy a product and it does n't work, usually it 's just a waste. But the Seal means dependable people have tried it already and stand behind it. That 's a big plus for me, " says Alivia Nicole. They keep one another 's interests in mind while reading, too. Case in point : Vicky loves bright nail polish -- so when Alivia Nicole saw a candy-apple red one in the pages of Good Housekeeping, she called her aunt to tell her about her find. She says, " I just knew she would love it. I was right ; now she wears it all the time. " Home run The family also finds decoration inspiration in GH 's pages. " The tips help make what you have look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of, but then I read in GH how to sew these beautiful covers, and voil -- the results were fabulous! " THE LIVINGSTONES reading since 1953 Coby Livingstone, 63, used to hide Good Housekeeping under her bedroom rug so that her four younger sisters -- Jackie Anderson, 62 ; Wendy Lundstrum, 60 ; Janet Carson, 59 ; and Linda Livingstone, 55 -- could n't read it until she let them. " It was a power thing, " Coby says with a sheepish laugh. " Our mother Margaret Livingstone gave her copy to me first, since I was the oldest, and I 'd stash it until I finished it cover to cover. " Today, sharing is key : The Midwestern sisters call and e-mail constantly, chatting about the newest tips, recipes, and stories in GH. " It 's one way we stay close, " says Linda. Table talk GH issues were always fanned out on the Livingstones ' wicker coffee table -- a tradition the sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us explain our values to the new men in our lives, " recalls Coby. " It was our way of saying, ' This is where we come from. Quality and dependability are important to us. ' " Add resourcefulness to that list, too : " Oh, and we love Heloise, " says Linda. " She taught me that some white wines can be used to get rid of red wine stains. " Easy listening Since three of the five sisters are vision-impaired, they listen to GH on tape. " When you lose your sight, you need things that make you feel normal, " says Wendy. " That 's GH for us. It 's our staple and our support. " " If I see a product in GH, I know it 's good!
