2009141 HandBOOK Headnote 4 no-sweat tricks guaranteed to increase speed // A smooth-running bike makes you faster : Just ask the pros. In the second world cup race of 2000, a few riders from the GT, Kona and Mongoose teams installed on-board chain lube systems to battle the thick dust on the Mazatlan, Mexico, course. Pieced together with medical supplies, including IV tubing and a syringe mounted on the seat tube, the contraption let a rider inject the chain with lube when it got too dry. But you do n't need to snoop around race pits to boost your speed. Here are four tweaks that 'll make your bike faster than ever. And the real beauty : You do n't need loads of maintenance know-how or a box full of tools to make these adjustments. BEGINNER TRICKS 1. Pump ' Em Up The easiest and most important way to improve your speed is to correctly adjust your tire pressure. An underinflated road tire can add enough drag to slow you 2 to 3 mph. If you run 75 psi in road tires intended for 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to-and your tire wears sooner. Tire pressure is n't so simple off-road : If your tires are pumped up too much, you 'll slip on climbs and flail over slippery roots and rocks. You may improve speed by lowering tire pressure. Start with about 45 psi. The more technical the trail, the lower you should go with the air pressure. Some lightweight riders even dip below 30 psi. On smoother trails, add pressure, up to about 60 psi. Tool : A pump with a gauge Cost : Nada Shop cost : C'mondo this yourself Difficulty : * Time : 3 minutes 2. Boost Braking Power It sounds counterintuitive-but to go faster, you need good brakes. Well-maintained brakes let you roll into corners faster yet with more control, and enable you to leave corners faster because of better line choice. Dirty rims and worn pads can add seconds to your time in a corner-rich event, and well-maintained brakes may even help you avoid a supporting role in somebody else 's crash.

Clean Derailleur Jockey Pulleys An often forgotten speed-sucker is the lowly derailleur jockey pulley. These pulleys turn so rapidly that dirty or poorly lubed bushings or worn-out ball bearings can cost you speed. To check your pulleys, remove the chain or hold it off a pulley, then slowly spin the pulley. It should turn smoothly and freely. If not, remove and clean it with something pointy( like a small screwdriver covered with a shop cloth) to get all the grit out of the groove. Re-lube with a drop of oil( or replace the ball bearings), then add a drop of blue Loctite to the small bolt that holds the pulley in the derailleur. Tools : Set of hex wrenches and small screwdriver Cost : Nothing, if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Difficulty : * * Time : 10-15 minutes ADVANCED TRICK 4. Fine-Tune Hub Bearings Hubs that are too tight or loose are inefficient and sap speed. To fine-tune your hub bearings, use two cone wrenches. One goes on the outer locknut and the other wrench fits on the cone nut, which controls how tight or loose the cone presses against the bearings inside the hub. Turning the cone nut clockwise tightens the bearings ; counterclockwise loosens. Eliminating play while avoiding overtightening requires loads of patience. One handy trick : Only tighten or loosen about 1/16th of a turn at a time-about the distance of one spoke to the next on a 32spoke wheel. This is an easy way to measure how much you 've tightened or loosened the wrench. Once you 've adjusted the cone nut, re-tighten the locknut. Looseness Test : Grab the top of the wheel with your thumb and forefinger while supporting the frame in your other hand. Wiggle the wheel side to side. If there 's lateral movement, you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel and spin it while holding the axle ends with your fingers. The wheel should spin smoothly with the axles resting lightly on your fingertips. Excessive drag makes it hard to hold onto the axles. To fix, slightly loosen the hub bearings.

GEAR Click into a gear easy enough to let you pedal up the steep face ahead. Sidebar HEADChin up ; do n't lean over the bar, unless you like endos.

HANDS When rolling down, rotate your wrists forward to keep the front wheel grounded. On the way out, pull the bar with each pedal stroke for more traction. BUTT Float it just in front of the saddle through the entry, then plant it on the tip of the saddle for the climb. BACK Slightly arched forward and low on the bike. LEGS Slightly bent ; once you roll across the bottom of the dip, snap forward and screw on the power. -Mark Riedy // <p>
