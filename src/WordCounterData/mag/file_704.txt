4153141 Section : DepartmentsTHE LIST # A powerful global magnetic field envelops Earth in a cozy blanket of protection against bursts of solar particles( see Page 18). But the solar system 's other rocky worlds are n't so lucky. # Mercury : Paltry The most petite planet has an appropriately puny magnetic field, just 1.1 percent as strong as Earth 's( SN Online : 5/7/15). # Venus : Zilch Earth 's nearest neighbor does n't generate a planetwide magnetic field, so the solar wind penetrates and is gradually stripping away the atmosphere. # The moon : Lost Magnetized lunar rocks hauled back by Apollo astronauts show that, at some point, the ancient moon had a hefty magnetic field. It has since died out( SN Online : 12/4/14). # Mars : Collapsed The Red Planet lacks a global magnetic field today, but magnetized regions of Martian crust point to an ancient magnetic field that eventually fizzled. # Earth 's magnetic field deflects charged solar particles toward the planet 's poles, generating auroras.
