2034541 Section : HEALTHY PET Choosing a puppy seems so easy. Just point to the cutest one in the litter, right? <p> The last time I shared my home with a puppy ; Jimmy Carter was president. It took me 2 decades to take the puppy plunge again. Now, I ca n't imagine what life was like before the arrival of Jazz, my energetic and always amusing 1-year-old Pembroke Welsh corgi. But finding this perfect-for-me pup required a lot of research. Do Your Homework <p> Before bringing any dog home, assess yourself. Do you have what it takes to be a responsible pet parent? Are you willing to commit the time to housebreak, exercise, socialize, and groom your puppy? Did you budget money for its needs? <p> " Too often, people pour more thought and energy into shopping for a car than looking for a canine companion, ' says Marry Becker, DVM, a veterinarian and author of The Healing Power of Pets( Hyperion, 2002). " Yet you may only drive that vehicle for 4 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of your life for 12 to 14 years, or more. " <p> Be patient in your puppy pursuit. I was. I spent more than a year researching different breeds, visiting shelters and breeders, and discussing the pros and cons of my " finalists " with veterinarians and animal behaviorists. " Investing time doing your homework before you adopt a puppy can pay off in the long ran, " says Rolan Tripp, DVM, a veterinarian who operates AnimalBehavior.Net, an online source of information on pet selection and animal behavior. " You ' re much more likely to find a dog that ideally fits into your lifestyle. " For a link to Dr. Tripp 's Web site, visit www.prevention.com/links Just Right for You <p> What you wo n't find is a perfect dog. Each canine possesses good and bad traits. But here 's how to increase your odds of finding the puppy that 's right for you. <p> STEP 1 : Assess yourself. " It 's important to recognize your own personality before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ' re a strong leader, it makes sense to get a powerful dog, but if you know that you 're a pussycat at heart who 'd rather pamper, then a toy breed or a dog with a passive nature would be a much better choice. " <p> STEP 2 : Identify what you want. Why do you really want a dog? Are you looking for a jogging mate or a television-watching companion? Do you want a pal for your children? A good watchdog? Then choose a dog that will fit your " job description. " <p> STEP 3 : Select based on temperament, not size. More than 400 breeds exist in the dog kingdom, from the itty-bitty Chihuahua to the mega-big Irish wolfhound. And, in between, plenty of wonderful mixed breeds. Do n't be fooled into thinking that the larger the breed, the higher the energy level. Jack Russell terriers, the type-A personalities of the canine world, run circles around bullmastiffs, the gentle giants that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important in temperament is not the dog 's size. Instead, look at the original purpose of the breed, and this individual 's behavior patterns, " says Dr. Tripp. " Beagles, for instance, were bred to bark while hunting or excited, so if barking bothers you, this may not be your best choice. " <p> Adds Dr. Becker, " While breed plays a part do n't discount your influence, in shaping your puppy 's personality and attitude. He 'll need your love, attention, and patience. Puppies are n't born with perfect manners. They make mistakes and need to be taught appropriate behaviors. " <p> Testing a puppy 's temperament is not an exact science, but try this popular technique. Gently roll each of your puppy finalists on his back, and watch his reaction. Generally, docile puppies tend to relax in your hands. Aboid puppies that fight free or try to nip you-two possible early signs of aggressiveness. <p> STEP 4 : Know where to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose to adopt a puppy is critical. Leading veterinary experts recommend three sources : responsible breeders, breed rescue groups, and humane animal shelters. <p> > " A responsible breeder shows genuine interest in the breed, maintains good medical records of the litter, invites you to visit several times before the puppies are ready for adoption and, most important, is willing to take the puppy back if you are no longer able to keep it, " says Beckie Williams, DVM, a house-call veterinarian who breeds Pembroke Welsh corgi puppies in southern California. " Reputable breeders also provide proof of genetic testing on the quality of the litter 's hips and eyes and records of any genetic diseases. " And for a pet-quality pup, you wo n't spend any more than you would at a pet store, where you have none of these benefits. To contact the American Kennel Club for a list of responsible breeders, go to www.prevention.com/links. <p> > Breed rescue groups cater to second chance dogs : purebreds that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to sleep. Finding a purebred through a rescue club is a viable option, especially if you 're familiar with that particular breed. <p> > Animal shelters often have puppies or young dogs. Quality shelters are more than just adoption centers. They are also places that offer obedience and puppy socialization classes and provide handouts on behavior and training tips. Major pet supply stores often donate space in their stores so that shelters can showcase their adoptable puppies and alert customers about area veterinary clinics. These stores are not, however, in the business of selling puppies.
