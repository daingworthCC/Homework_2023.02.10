2010541 Snags, frustrations, and fights can turn paradise found into holiday hell. Use these tips to stay mellow and so into each other. // You 're taking a trip together. Get ready for a weeklong fantasy for two, right? Well, maybe. " Yes, vacations are like mini utopias in that there 's no daily grind, but that does n't mean you 're going to agree magically on everything, " says sex and relationship expert Joy Davidson, PhD, author of Fearless Sex. In fact, trips a deux can be a prime breeding ground for problems : travel headaches, clashing relaxation styles, major pressure for everything to be postcard perfect. But if you know how to deal ahead of time, you can keep your romantic Club Med from morphing into Club Mediocre( or worse, Club **25;1301;TOOLONG). HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 1 You Begin the Vacation Stressed Out Lingering work hassles, traffic jams, and near anal probes by airport security do n't exactly foster feelings of R &; R.

All the details that have to be wrapped up before you can escape-work deadlines, bikini shopping, pet boarding-shorten your fuse. Suddenly, a line that 's 10 deep at the check-in counter is enough to cause a meltdown. So to ensure your tension does n't eclipse the trip, acknowledge the sucky situation and blame it rather than each other, suggests couples therapist Paul Coleman, PsyD. author of How to Say It : For Couples. " Say, " Getting to the airport was a nightmare. Thank God that 's over. ' ' " That way you recognize the torture, but you also confirm that it 's now done with so yon can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in transit, ease further into mai tai mode by discussing your plans for the week ahead.

And I 'm so looking forward to seeing you in a grass skirt, ' ' " Kate recalls. " That was all it took. I was n't annoyed anymore. " HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 2 Big Spender Versus Tightwad Cash can be a problem if one of you is thinking filet mignon while the other is sneaking plastic bags into the all-you-caneat buffet. To get what you both want, start with the cold hard facts. What 's your budget for meals, tours, side trips, etc.? Once you have a figure, you can strike a balance on how to spend it. Coleman suggests that you mix it up. For instance, have el cheapo lunches so you can justify splurging on fancier dinners. Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and be resourceful. " On a trip to New Mexico, Jerry did n't want to shell out $30 for a guided tour of the Indian ruins, which I really wanted to see, " says Jennifer, 27.

" HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 3 Your Idea of Fun Does n't Mesh With His Love gurus will tell you that compromise is so healthy. Yeah, right-not if it means ending up with a watered-down version of the vacation you really wanted. " My job is stressful, so I wanted to lie out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 29. " But Matt wanted to go hiking, hiking, and sweating. " Fact is that while a vacation is partly about getting close, it 's also about having F-U-N. So in the name of achieving that, you do n't have to do every little thing together. " Matt and I did go to an island, but while I spent the afternoons reading books on the beach, he was off windsurfing or rock climbing. It was bliss, " says Natalie. So detach from the hip on some days. You 'll both get what you want and have exciting stories to tell each other afterward. Also, allow each other to suggest an activity the other person has to try. Yes, that means you may have to go on one hike, but you 'll probably enjoy yourself. Plus, it shows a willingness to accommodate each others needs.

HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 4 Your Sexpectations Clash For some, vacations mean shagging like Viagra-popping monkeys. For others, its a pig-out and snooze marathon. So how to jibe your desires? If your sex drive is in siesta mode and he 's the sex-crazed chimp, do n't feel pressured to throw him a mercy bonk every time he bones up, insists Davidson. But bear in mind, your libido may be jet-lagged, which he may be able to remedy with some sensual, hands-on persuasion. If you 're really not feeling the magic, just let him know you need a little time to ease into things. If it 's just the opposite-you own the insatiable sex drive ; he 's there for a beer buzz-partaking in a few adrenaline-pumping activities may launch his loins. " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign city-strengthens your bond, " says Coleman. " Plus, it 'll boost his testosterone levels, making him feel infinitely more sexual. " To further stoke his fire, make some sexual suggestions in a nonsexual setting. Mention doing it in the late afternoon, for instance, or a randy location switch, like swapping the bed for the balcony. Your dirty desires will give him a seriously bad case of sex-on-the-brain over breakfast. HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 5 You Need Space Do n't feel guilty about craving a little me-time. You 're trying to rejuvenate, and that involves time together... and apart. So call a mini vacay from the vacay for some time inside your own head, says Coleman. " You relax by yourself in away that you ca n't when you 're with him. " The trick, however, is asking for time out without coming offlike an antisocial hermit. One option : Choose an activity that is distinctly chick. When Julia, 26, needed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another time, I booked a treatment at the resort spa, " she admits. " Keith was not at all interested. " Alternatively, just explain to your guy that you need time to detox your fried brain and say you 'll meet him back at the room in one hour. But do n't stay away too much longer than that or he may fear you 've found yourself a cute cabana boy. HOLIDAY LOVE HURDLE 6 You Go Head-to-Head In the alternate universe that is a vacation-where we expect to be a supercouple who agree on every little thing-spats seem so much worse :( a) Hi.

If he invites his new best friend Dave the barman and his girlfriend, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to a romantic dinner for two, it might be worth sucking it up and letting the good times roll. If it 's a deeper issue, such as the way he cops an attitude if you sleep too late and miss the " shining " sunrise, hashing it out right there saves you from brewing resentment and exploding later.
