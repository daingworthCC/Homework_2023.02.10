5007941 <p> Americans are rarely shy of buying something today -- and paying for it tomorrow. <p> However, latest figures show they 're requesting the lowest number of credit inquiries in almost two decades. <p> For the 18th consecutive quarter, household debt rose during the fourth quarter of 2018 to $13.54 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in a report released Tuesday. Overall, households have 21% more debt now than they did in the years following the financial crisis. <p> At the same time, credit inquiries for the past six months have dropped to the lowest level in the history of this data, which stretches back to 2003, the New York Fed found. <p> There were fewer than 145 million " hard " credit pulls during fourth quarter -- these are credit inquiries that occur when a consumer authorizes a lender to request a copy of their credit report. Comparatively, there were over 218 million such credit inquiries reported during the first quarter of 2003. <p> These inquiries are viewed as a proxy for consumer demand for credit, since they generally occur when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fed 's report is the latest indication that consumers are n't requesting new loans. <p> ' People and banks are starting to tread more lightly, readying themselves for when economic times are n't so good in the future. ' -- Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards <p> " It 's significant that consumer credit demand is shrinking, " said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards TREE, -2.79% " It 's another sign that consumers might finally be starting to say they 've hit their limits when it comes to debt. " <p> A cooling in everything from mortgages to credit cards suggests that consumers could be growing more conservative when it comes to spending, at a time when the economic outlook is already looking murky. " People and banks are starting to tread more lightly, readying themselves for when economic times are n't so good in the future, " Schulz said. <h> Rising interest rates have made consumers less hungry for new loans <p> Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve over the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what you 'd expect to see in an economy where interest rates have risen by over 200 basis points, " said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist with research firm Capital Economics. " Households are responding by borrowing less. " <p> Fewer homeowners stood to benefit from refinancing their home loans, which also led to a significant decline in mortgage applications. <p> Rising rates have particularly taken a bite out of mortgage activity. Mortgage rates have dropped in 2019, but they rose for much of last year. Consequently, fewer homeowners stood to benefit from refinancing their home loans -- leading to a significant decline in mortgage applications. <p> When coupled with rising home prices, higher mortgage rates have also put a damper on home-buying activity and, therefore, mortgages for new home purchases. <p> Meanwhile, credit-card rates have reached an all-time high, according to data from CreditCards.com. While auto-loan originations grew to the highest level in the nearly two decades the New York Fed has tracked this data, the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also slowed in the fourth quarter. <h> Banks are less eager to lend to consumers <p> Banks have tightened their lending practices. The Fed 's bank survey found that lenders have upped their standards for credit-card and jumbo mortgages -- they do this by charging premiums above the standard interest rate, reducing how much credit they offer or by forcing borrowers to meet more stringent requirements during underwriting. <p> Some credit-card issuers are getting more cautious. ' Rewards are still quite lucrative, but they 're not where they were a few years ago. ' -- Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com <p> Banks have also begun to pull back some of their best credit-card rewards offers, said Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com. " Some issuers are getting more cautious, " he said. " Rewards are still quite lucrative, but they 're not where they were a few years ago. " <p> One reason : The competition to provide the best reward had become unsustainable. At the same time, economic uncertainty is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see any big troubles on the horizon -- they 're practicing this ' ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ' theory, " Rossman said. <h> Good news : Households are keeping up with their debt <p> Delinquency rates remained unchanged from the same period in 2017, according to the New York Fed 's report. At year 's end, 4.7% of outstanding household debt was in some stage of delinquency. <p> Moreover, only 195,000 consumers had a bankruptcy notation added to their credit report during the fourth quarter. That 's 5,000 fewer people than during the same period a year earlier. <p> This is a reflection, to an extent, of the strong labor market, since workers ' wages are rising and consumers have more freedom to search for better paying jobs given the low rate of unemployment. <p> Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.
