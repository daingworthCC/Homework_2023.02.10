4112041 The Futurist art movement still moves us 100 years later <p> The Futurists stormed Italy in the early 20th century, picking a fight with anything pretty, sentimental or pass. They celebrated violence, speed, masculinity and, above all, modernity. <p> The art movement 's 2009 centennial brought a rash of retrospectives to Italy and elsewhere. The biggest-ever American exhibition is scheduled to open at the Guggenheim in 2014. Since the Futurists proposed the destruction of museums( " cemeteries, " in their parlance), they would have hated these tributes. But they would have been pleased to discover that their influence remains potent in the 21st century. <p> In 1909, when Futurism 's father, the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, penned his first furious manifesto, Italy had been reduced to a European backwater, and it lacked coal, making industrialization painfully slow. <p> Marinetti scorned the nostalgia for the Renaissance and Rome. " He was tired of hearing about them, " says Christine Poggi, a University of Pennsylvania art historian. He wanted Italians to move on, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He exhorted Italians to find beauty in technology : " A roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace, " the marble Hellenistic masterpiece. <p> All types of artists quickly took up the cause and started churning out manifestoes of their own. Among other measures, they declared a ten-year moratorium on the nude in paintings. " It was considered the archetypal subject of the Renaissance, and it was not modern, " Poggi says. Umberto Boccioni, a sculptor who had once painted a semi-nude of his own plump and aged mother, went on to create Unique Forms of Continuity in Space( above), a striding, muscular bronze figure that is perhaps the marquee Futurist work. <p> The Futurists depicted hurtlingtrains, human bodies in motion, machine-gun fire, electric lights and metropolises under construction. Their bold techniques touched everything from Art Deco to Dadaism. The movement still influences " almost any artist interested in kineticism or working with light, " Poggi says. This spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patterns inspired by the works of the Futurist Fortunato Depero. <p> Chris Bangle, the revolutionary chief designer of BMW from 1992 to 2009, says that Boccioni 's sculptures allowed him to see a fourth dimension, " that of the wind. " Bangle created surfaces with a mix of convex and concave curves that exuded agility, such as the GINA Light concept car( left). Upon the release of the Bangle-era BMW Z4 Coupe in 2006, BusinessWeek observed that it seems to be moving " even when standing still. " <p> " I think Boccioni would have thought that somebody had finally done honor to what he tried to wrestle out of form and space, " Bangle says. " He would have liked those cars.
