2018941 Section : MONEY UPDATE News about your money <p> When the $13 billion insurance subsidiaries of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp. were taken over by state regulators in New York and California in April, most Americans did n't much care. But as they see how the junk-bond-driven debacle could eventually cost them -- even if they never heard of First Executive until now -- they 'll start caring a lot. The public, you included, could end up paying higher state taxes, forking over more in life insurance premiums or getting lower rates of return on policies and annuities. <p> Of course, that 's a relatively sweet deal compared with what the owners of First Executive 's 348,000 insurance policies, annuities and guaranteed investment contracts( GICs) may get. Thanks to the aggressive investment practices of First Executive under its chairman Fred Carr, who was one of Michael Milken 's biggest junk bond customers, clients of the two troubled units -- Executive Life Insurance Co. in Los Angeles and the Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York City -- could wind up getting stiffed. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates on First Executive annuities to between 3% and 7%. All told, unless other companies come along and take over the units, the mess will almost certainly lead to the insurance industry 's biggest failure ever, dwarfing the 1983 fall of $4 billion Baldwin-United. <p> If a bailout is required, as now seems likely, the ripple effects could spread dramatically. That 's because, unlike the banking and thrift industries, which have federally guaranteed deposit insurance, life insurers in 47 states rely on a patchwork of industry-sponsored state " guarantee " funds.( Only Colorado, Louisiana, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. have no such funds.) A guarantee fund represents a promise that the insurers licensed to do business in the state will chip in a portion of their premiums to help bail out policyholders of a rival insurer that goes bust. <p> If healthy insurers have to pony up cash for First Executive customers, they 'll almost certainly turn to their policyholders for the money. Result : rising premiums, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early to say how large the price hikes or payout cuts might be. <p> The potential for tax hikes, although also speculative, is no less ominous. In 36 of the states with guarantee funds, insurance companies get substantial tax breaks for pitching in on a bailout. Since these states could need to make up $3 billion in lost tax revenue, according to Marty Leary, research director of the Southern Finance Project, a Charlotte, N.C. study group, their households might be hit with tax hikes amounting to $100 or more. <p> There is, however, at least some good that could eventually come out of all this. First Executive 's fall could be the catalyst for congressional action, such as the creation of federal standards for insurers ' junk bond holdings. Traditionally, Congress has let the states plus the National Association of Insurance Commissioners( NAIC) keep tabs on insurers. But given that an NAIC internal memo in December 1990 stated that California 's Executive Life was in " no imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in, says consumer advocate Robert Hunter, president of the not-for-profit National Insurance Consumer Organization. " It 's clear that the state regulators have n't done enough, " he says.
