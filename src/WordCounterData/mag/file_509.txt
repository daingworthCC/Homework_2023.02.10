4106341 They first saw each other at a bar in the East Village in December 1997, and things did not immediately get off on the right foot. " It was all very confusing, " says Andrew Berg, 41, of meeting his future spouse, Dominic Pisciotta, 39. <p> " I had a biological daughter who 'd just been born, " says Berg, the senior director of original programming at A &E,; who 'd been a sperm donor for a lesbian couple. " I was showing the picture to people, and Pisciotta thought I was some guy who left his wife at home with a newborn to go out drinking. " <p> Complicating matters further, Pisciotta was there with an ex-girlfriend. <p> " He thought I was straight, " says Pisciotta, who works as the assistant commissioner of the Department of Information Technology for the state of New York. <p> But the following night, the two men met again at a New Year 's Eve party, and though Pisciotta 's ex was there again, that did n't keep Berg away. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisciotta says. <p> So they headed to the Pyramid Club, where they talked deep into the night and shared their first kiss. Within months, Pisciotta, who had been living in Virginia, moved north -- and in with his new boyfriend. <p> In 2001 they held a commitment ceremony in Vermont, and two years later they were featured on the cover of Newsweek for a story about same-sex marriage, standing behind the headline( since answered) " Is Gay Marriage Next? " They hired a surrogate and had two fraternal twins, who are now 8 and will serve as the couple 's ringbearers on Sunday. <p> For Pisciotta, it wo n't be a day off : He 's helping to make sure the systems are all up and running for other gay couples tying the knot so their paperwork is processed as smoothly as possible. <p> Berg continues to be a little uneasy with the H word. " We 've been using ' partner, ' and it 's confusing. There have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What business are you in? ' We began joking that we 're in the business of love. But ' husband ' is going to take some getting used to, too. As more states approve gay marriage, it wo n't sound funny. Right now it sounds funny. " <p> The kids, for their part, have no qualms about any of it. " They 're kind of driving the wedding, " says Berg. " They want us to get married.
