2017341 The George R. Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, Toronto, is the concluding venue for the exhibition " White on White, " featuring works by 20 contemporary Canadian ceramists. Originated by the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery, Waterloo, Ontario, the show toured to five cities in the Far East prior to opening at the Gardiner( there through February 8, 1998). In this excerpt from the catalogue, curators Anne McPherson and Susan Jefferies discuss the fascination with whiteness that has held potters of many lands and historical eras. // White is the absence of color, the sum of all colors. It brings to clay meanings both inherent and external to it : the notions of emptiness, purity, simplicity, nakedness, lightness, newness, spirituality, death and transcendence. The artist who chooses to work with these meanings may elaborate on them, abstract from them or confound them. While some artists in this exhibition subscribe to the dictum that a work of art... " shouLd not mean but be, " others have given their work conceptual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. During several expansive periods of ceramic history, the quest for a workable white cLay body with a cLear or white covering engaged potters in many parts of the worLd. PorceLain, with its strengths and translucency, was first produced in southern China during the T'ang Dynasty in the Late eighth or earLy ninth century. It took Europeans untiL the earLy 18th century to master the difficulties of a porcellanous clay body and the technology of high-fired kilns. Adding a clear glaze to porcelain highlighted its reflective quality and depth.

In Korea in the 15th century, white sLips and glazes of ravishing beauty were produced on Punch " ng wares. In Europe slips( Liquid cLay used as a glaze) tended to give a yellower hue because of trace eLements in the cLay. In the Islamic world tin oxide was added to a Lead gLaze, producing a suitable white covering for decoration on earthenware. This innovation made its way across Europe. In Italy, where these wares are called maiolica, potters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce different shades of white and to decorate their wares with the sophisticated interplay of white on white, caLled bianco sopra bianco. Low-fired wares such as majolica have had many revivaLs since those great early Islamic pots were made, and seem to have been of particular interest in the West following less colorful, nondecorative periods of production. Tin has often been replaced by other materiaLs, and sometimes the gLossy white glaze is not decorated at all, but Left exposed over the clay. The preoccupation with white has never waned. In England in the 20th century Lucie Rie developed a trademark thick white glaze for her functional wares and a forceful, exploding white gLaze for vases. Hans Coper spent virtualLy his entire Life refining, layering and scratching through white glazes. OnLy rareLy did he feel the need to venture beyond an exploration of white tones. Gordon Baldwin and Ewen Henderson have continued this tradition of working almost exclusively in white. In Japan Ryoji Koie uses white in ways that are reminiscent of the traditional, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitamura 's exquisite white inlay work recalls raked Zen gardens or ancient textiLes. The Canadian artists exhibiting here have made their contributions to this white-on-white tradition with porcelains, white glazes and clear glazes of great beauty, with earthenware pieces of dignity and imagination, with natural and architectonic stoneware.... They have shown the confidence, ability and sensitivity to pay their debt to the past through work and study, but have never been slavishly committed to it. They realize that to try and recreate an object situated at a different point in history will only be a half truth, as its cultural context and vigor have been lost. In addition to the artists whose works are illustrated here, the exhibition included Robert Archambeau, Roseline Delisle, Sadashi Inuzuka, Kayo O'Young, Lisette Savaria and Francois Potvin, and Bruce Taylor.
