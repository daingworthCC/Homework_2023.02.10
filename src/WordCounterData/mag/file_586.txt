4139141 Supernova suspects # No one knows which of our galaxy 's stars will be the next supernova, but here 's a rundown of some famous stars with explosive potential # Each second in the core of our Sun, about 600 million tons of hydrogen nuclei become rearranged into 596 million to tons of helium nuclei. These 4 million " missing " tons get transformed directly into energy and, ultimately, sunshine. Every object astronomers regard as a " normal " star is doing something similar, producing energy to support itself against its own weight through one or more types of nuclear fusion reactions. Each of the naked-eye stars we see on a clear evening can be described accurately as a gravitationally contained thermonuclear reactor. And about once or twice a century, on average, one of these fiery cauldrons in our galaxy becomes unstable and explodes. # The result is a supernova -- a blast that can reach a luminosity more than 10 billion times greater than the Sun and appear bright enough at its peak to outshine the combined light of all the stars in its host galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may leave behind a crushed remnant of the stellar core in the form of the most extreme objects scientists know of -- neutron stars no bigger than a city and black holes with gravity so strong that even light ca n't escape. # As far as astronomers can tell, the Milky Way 's supernova production line seems to be running a bit behind. The last naked-eye supernova likely was noticed only by John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal of England, while cataloging stars in August 1680. He noted a star in the constellation Cassiopeia that a later generation of astronomers could n't find, but its position is suspiciously close to the expanding debris of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. Dimmed by distance and interstellar dust, the Cas A supernova attracted no attention because its brightness never would have exceeded 3rd magnitude, and it faded to near the limit of naked-eye visibility by the time Flamsteed recorded it. # A more recent supernova lacked an earthly audience altogether. Radio and X-ray measurements tracking the expansion of G1.9+0.3, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why in Sagittarius, reveal that light from its explosion would have washed over Earth less than 150 years ago. The most recent supernova known in our galaxy might have been seen around the 1860s if intervening dust had n't totally obscured its light. # This sums up the inventory of known Milky Way supernovae in the past 400 years. For the past century, astronomers seeking to understand the mechanisms that drive these explosions and the stars that produce them have gathered information from supernova remnants in our galaxy and supernovae in other galaxies. For most supernovae, a short fuse is lit when stars born with more than about six to nine times the Sun 's mass run through a series of fusion fuels and finally exhaust them, leading to the collapse of their cores, tine formation of a neutron star or black hole at their centers, and explosions that blast the overlying stellar layers outward at high speed. Less frequent types result from nuclear processes that sap energy from stellar cores before they run out of fuel, forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of runaway thermonuclear reactions. # Thankfully, no stars doomed to end their lives as supernovas lie near enough to the solar system to pose a significant threat to Earth in the immediate future. Yet many famous stars are fated to explode and, when their time comes, will put on quite a show for earthly observers. But which ones? And how soon? # Proximity bombs # Two stars top any list of potential near-Earth supernovae. The closest by far is the 6th-magnitude binary system IK Pegasi. The primary component is a normal star of spectral type A weighing about 1.7 solar masses, and its companion is a heavy white dwarf, a compact stellar remnant weighing about 1.2 Suns yet only about as big as Earth. White dwarfs represent the end state for low-mass stars like the Sun and no longer are capable of generating energy through stable internal nuclear reactions. However, when a white dwarf 's mass teeters near a physical limit of around 1.4 Suns -- the exact number depends in part on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smithereens and produce what astronomers call a type la supernova. # There 's only one way this can happen for IK Pegasi. The aging primary star eventually will expand so much that its atmosphere will stream onto the white dwarf, where matter may accumulate and slowly nudge the object toward its explosive demise. According to an evolutionary model of the system by Martin Beech at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada, some 1.9 billion years will pass before the fireworks begin. Long before this happens, the citizens of Earth will be facing much bigger problems thanks to the steadily increasing luminosity of the aging Sun. In half the time it 'll take for IK Pegasi to explode, Earth no longer will be inhabitable. # A different sort of nearby supernova may come from Spica, the 1st-magnitude luminary of the constellation Virgo and among the hottest stars we see. Located about 260 light-years away, this blue star has 12,000 times the Sun 's luminosity and weighs in at about 10 solar masses, which makes it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in which the star 's core collapses. But a variety of factors complicate Spica 's future. First, it spins about 80 times faster than the Sun, and second, it has a close companion, another blue star of about 7 solar masses. This secondary is so close that it takes only four days to complete an orbit -- a period about 90 times faster than Earth revolves around the Sun. The mutual gravitational pull of these huge stars warps them into distinctly oval shapes. # Like the Sun, both members of this system still fuse hydrogen in their cores, but Spica may be close to polishing off its allotment and starting its evolution into a giant. Its distorted profile and rapid spin guarantee that it will transfer some portion of its outer layers to its partner, with additional mass lost to space. " The now more massive component will lose about 7 to 8 solar masses, and the now less massive star will likely accrete 50 to 80 percent of that, " says Norbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore, the now less massive star will probably explode as a supernova. " # If Spica 's weight loss takes it below the core-collapse threshold, it would form a white dwarf. Millions of years later, when its companion similarly evolves, it will return to Spica some of the mass it received, but the end result of this stellar oversharing is unclear. Perhaps the system will end up much like IK Pegasi, with white-dwarf Spica bypassing its fate as a type II supernova to explode instead as a type la. # Another consequence of rapid rotation is to reduce the star 's luminosity and central temperature, which means it behaves as if it has a lower mass than it really does. For stars, mass is destiny. The more they have, the brighter they shine and the faster they run though their fuel supply. Nuclear fusion transforms hydrogen into helium, producing energy in the form of gamma rays and neutrinos, which are ghostly particles that travel at nearly the speed of light and rarely interact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's core contracts and heats until the accumulated helium " waste " ignites, producing energy by fusing helium nuclei into carbon and oxygen. The recycling program ends here for stars around the Sun 's mass, which end up as carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. # More massive stars tap into a sequence of fuels to extend their energy-producing lives. As each runs low -- first hydrogen, then helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon -- the core contracts, heats up, and ignites waste from the previous reactions. But once silicon fusion begins and an iron-nickel core starts to form, the star 's days are numbered and a core collapse is imminent. # Some massive stars wo n't live long enough to reach this point. For stars born within a narrow mass range -- 9 to 9.25 solar masses if they have a chemical composition similar to the Sun -- the fatal blow comes toward the end of carbon fusion, when the core contains a mix of oxygen, magnesium, and neon. At a critical density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core reaches a temperature hot enough to initiate neon fusion. This electron-capture process removes pressure support from the core, which then collapses under its own weight and produces a weak type II supernova. Could Spica 's crazy spin place its effective mass in the right range for this to occur? If so, it would become a supernova sooner than in the other scenarios, although still millions of years from now. # While the closest supernova candidates wo n't supply us with a bang any time soon, many other stars in our corner of the galaxy are likely to explode in the astronomically near future. Among them are a few truly famous names. # Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse # If there were a poster child for supernova progenitors, it would be Betelgeuse, the magnitude 0.6 red supergiant that maiks the right shoulder of Orion the Hunter. Suggestive of its true physical size, Betelgeuse has the largest angular diameter of any star other than the Sun despite a distance of 640 light-years. If this benemoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would engulf all planetary orbits inside Jupiter 's. Amazingly, this actually understates the star 's influence. In 2009, astronomers using the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope imaged a giant plume of gas extending at least six times the star 's diameter, equivalent to the distance between Neptune and the Sun, and a complex nebula of irregular dusty arcs reaching some 16 times farther. Astronomers estimate that, all told, the star 's extensive mass loss affects the environment out to a light-year or more from its surface. # Born about 8 million years ago with an estimated 20 solar masses, Betelgeuse is approaching the end of its life. Like most stars in its mass range, this monster is destined to cycle through a full suite of nuclear fuels until it produces an iron core, which will then collapse to produce a type II-P( for " plateau ") supernova and a neutron star. Although astronomers ca n't peek " under the hood " to see what 's actually happening in the star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evolutionary models. This research suggests Betelgeuse will go supernova sometime between 20,000 and 100,000 years from now. # Here 's how the event will play out for earthly observers. Facilities designed to detect neutrinos will notice a brief burst associated with the collapse of the star 's core. Astronomers first saw such a signal in Supernova 1987A, a peculiar type II-P explosion in a neighboring galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud ; it remains the closest stellar explosion seen in centuries. For a similar 10-second burst, says Michael Richmond at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, " The flux of energy in neutrinos coming from Betelgeuse would be roughly 1,000 times larger than the flux coming from our Sun. " Since neutrinos can travel through a light-year of solid lead without bumping into a single atom, he notes, this boon to astrophysics will come with no threat to Earth and its inhabitants. # The next signal will be an ultraviolet or, possibly, weak X-ray flash as the supernova 's shock wave breaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid increase in the blast 's visible light. Some two weeks after the explosion, Betelgeuse likely will reach a peak visual brightness exceeding magnitude -10.5, appearing as a single searing point of light brighter than a quarter Moon and easily visible during the day. A key feature of type II-P events, which are the most common type in our part of the universe, is that the subsequent fading levels off for many weeks. This occurs as the expanding shock wave traverses the star 's vast hydrogen envelope, ionizing the gas and creating an opaque surface that prevents us from seeing visible light from the inner parts of the shredded star. As the shock wave speeds through, the atoms recombine, form more transparent neutral hydrogen, and let astronomers see deeper layers. # Once the plateau phase ends roughly 100 days after peak brightness, Betelgeuse will fade more rapidly. Still, based on expectations for a typical type II-P supernova, it will remain visible in daylight with a brightness exceeding magnitude -5 even a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still may rival Sirius, now the night sky 's brightest star. # But the show wo n't be over then. Astronomers will have an unprecedented view of the formation of a young supernova remnant and neutron star. Roughly 6 million years after the explosion, a much diminished shock wave will reach the solar system, according to a study led by Michelle Dolan and Grant Mathews at the University of Notre Dame. They calculate that the solar wind, an outflow of ionized gas from the Sun, will hold the shock wave in check, preventing it from penetrating closer than about 2 1/2 times Earth 's orbital distance, and that the shock will take more than a thousand years to pass by. # And Betelgeuse might not be the only supernova progenitor in Orion. Astronomers were thrown for a loop when SN 1987A erupted from a blue supergiant star rather than a red one. It was an unusual explosion, and researchers have speculated that the progenitor star may have been either a fast rotator or blew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown that under the right conditions, a blue supergiant can explode long before it evolves to the red supergiant stage. This suggests that Rigel, located opposite Betelgeuse at Orion 's left knee, may possibly end its days as a type II-P supernova. If it does, its peak visual brightness would exceed magnitude -9, slightly dimmer than Supernova Betelgeuse due to its greater distance of about 850 light-years. # Vela superstar # Wolf-Rayet stars are born with masses at least 25 times greater than the Sun and, as a consequence, burn through their fuel allotment much faster than stars like Betelgeuse and Rigel. They run so hot that intense stellar winds already have stripped away their vast hydrogen atmospheres, which constitute most of their birth mass, and even whittled away much of the helium layer below, laying bare some of the byproducts of advanced nuclear fusion reactions. These stars come in three flavors based on their enrichment of nitrogen( WN), carbon( WC), and oxygen( WO). They radiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high temperatures, they are n't especially bright optically. # The 2nd-magnitude star Gamma Velorum is a binary system in the constellation Vela that contains the closest Wolf-Rayet star to Earth. Located at an estimated distance of 1,100 light-years, the primary is a superhot giant star weighing about 30 solar masses. Its WC companion probably weighs about 9 Suns now but started out with 25 to perhaps 40 solar masses. Some astronomers estimate the system is more than 5 million years old, which would mean a star in this mass range should be in its twilight years. The WC star eventually will form an iron core, collapse, and explode, but it is n't at all clear what that explosion will look like or whether it will leave behind a neutron star or black hole. # The optimal case requires a quickly rotating core, which might let the WC star produce an especially energetic type Ic supernova peaking at a visual magnitude as high as -10, rivaling the blast from much-closer Betelgeuse. These explosions also are associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest-energy radiation powered by a black hole formed inside the star during collapse. But it 's impossible to be more definitive about what may happen at Gamma Velorum : Wolf-Rayet stars are rare, and astronomers do n't truly understand the progenitors of type It supernovae. # From nova to supernova # Our last candidate, RS Ophiuchi, belongs to a different type of binary system. This close stellar duo contains a white dwarf that undergoes repeated outbursts called novae, which are in effect at supernovas little cousin. They occur when hydrogen from a normal star flaws onto the dwarf, gradually piles up as a surface layer, eventually reaches a flash point, and explodes in a runaway thermonuclear reaction. Only the accumulated gas erupts, leaving the white dwarf unharmed and ready to begin the process again. Systems producing so-called classical novae may take 10,000 years between outbursts. But RS Ophiuchi is a much rarer system called a symbiotic recurrent nova, which pairs a red giant with a white dwarf. The dwarf star accumulates gas so quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades. # Until recently, astronomers thought these eruptions blew off all of the accumulated mass, preventing the white dwarf from growing toward the 1.4-solar-mass tipping point needed for a type Ia supernova. But the validity of this assumption is now in doubt. # RS Ophiuchi lies about 5,200 light-years from Earth and " goes nova " very couple of decades, most recently in 2006. Measurements from the latest outburst suggest the white dwarf is relatively close to its mass limit. If it exploded, its peak brightness could exceed a visual magnitude of -8, roughly the brightness of a four-day-old Moon seen as a single brilliant point. # An important aspect of RS Ophiuchi that no direct observations can establish is the compact object 's composition. Is it a carbon-oxygen or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf? If the latter then as the dwarf grows toward its mass limit, the electron-capture process will cause a collapse to a neutron star and a weak supernova. # Despite their violence, supernovae transformed a sterile universe into one hospitable to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars and forged in the blasts themselves. Whether it 's RS Ophiuchi, Gamma Velorum, Betelgeuse, or some other star, the light from the next naked-eye supernova may already be on its way, bringing a cosmic delight to skywatchers and a scientific bonanza for astronomers. # The wheel of supernovae # This chart breaks down the frequency of different supernova classes determined by detailed searches covering a large volume of the most common and best understood. Type Ia supernovae from exploding white dwarfs are the next most common, although astronomers have started to recognize additional subtypes. Very massive luminous blue variables like Eta Carinae and S Doradus one day may explode as type II-L or IIn supernovae. ASTRONOMY : ROEN KELLY ; ADAPTED FROM W.
