4146041 Selecting food morsels from a buffet table can require a bit of focus. Imagine then that you are a dragonfly and have to pick out, chase, and then catch one insect in a dense swarm of other potential dinners( and mates!) zipping every which way. New research has revealed how dragonflies manage to do this--by employing a rarely documented neuronal mechanism akin to one described in primates. # TABLE # Steven D. Wiederman and David C. O'Carroll of the University of Adelaide in Australia made the discovery by recording dragonfly neuronal activity in the lab. They inserted an electrode some 1,500 times thinner than a human hair into the brains of dragonflies. Then they drifted a small dark target against a bright background across the dragonflies ' visual field while monitoring the electrical response of a visual neuron--dubbed CSTMD1--that is involved in motion detection. Unsurprisingly, the neuron showed a response that varied characteristically with the location and the size of the target, as well as with the contrast between the target and the background. Next, the researchers offered two targets in different combinations of size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insects ' visual field. This time, the neuron consistently " chose " one target over the other and tracked it even when the other target was equally or even more salient, a phenomenon known as " selective attention. " " The neuronal architecture permits the dragonfly to select a single target from multiple distractions in their environment--an important task for a predator, " says Wiederman. # He adds that further experiments on dragonflies " will aid our understanding of how brains filter information to attend to a single element. " These sorts of findings could prove helpful in a variety of fields, including cognitive science and robotics--for example, in the design of artificial vision systems.( Current Biology) # THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE. #
