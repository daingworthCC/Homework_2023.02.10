4140141 Fifty-five years after its debut, Lorraine Hansberry 's classic A Raisin in the Sun lives again on Broadway, starring Anika Noni Rose, Sophie Okonedo and LaTanya Richardson Jackson # When the spring revival of A Raisin in the Sun was announced, theater lovers thought they had hit the lottery : Denzel Washington was cast as the short-sighted big dreamer Walter Lee Younger, and Diahann Carroll, making her grand return to Broadway, would perform opposite him in the role of Lena " Mama " Younger. It was n't the role she once pictured she 'd play ever since she first saw a rehearsal of the 1959 production starring her good friend Sidney Poitier. " I 've wanted to do itbut never thought I would wait a thousand years so I could play the mother, " Carroll, 78, said jokingly. But weeks into rehearsal, Carroll left the play, and actress LaTanya Richardson Jackson stepped into her role as the matriarch of an impoverished Chicago family waiting on a $10,000 insurance check that will afford them a better life. In a statement, Carroll explained : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite different than the extensive amount of time preparing and appearing ' live ' on Broadway eight times a week. I enjoyed working with Scott Rudin, Denzel Washington, Kenny Leon and the amazing cast. I wish them well. " # Longtime stage director Kenny Leon knows all too well the commitment needed for a theater production. " The physical demands of rehearsing, retaining information and doing that every dayit was too difficult, " says Leon. " I wanted Ms. Carroll to have another major shot on Broadway, but she was like, ' I just can not do it, Kenny. ' It was a beautiful, graceful thing and I love her. She 's one of our American treasures. " # With tickets already selling and audiences eager to see Washingtonwho will be joined onstage by two phenomenal talents, Tony Award winner Anika Noni Rose and British actress Sophie Okonedothe show must go on. The addition of Jackson, who appeared in the 2009 revival of August Wilson 's Joe Turner 's Come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's excited about the dynamic she and Washington will bring to his second Broadway adaptation of Raisin( the first, in 2004, featured sean " Diddy " Combs, Phylicia Rashad, Audra McDonald and Sanaa Lathan). " It 's bittersweet but exciting that LaTanya was able to step in. She and Denzel are from that same school where you will not outwork them, " he says. " Denzel came from The Negro Ensemble Company, and LaTanya is a theater beast. " Leon, who recently directed Jackson in the Hallmark movie The Watsons Go to Birmingham, knows firsthand Jackson 's commitment to her characters. " When you ask LaTanya to paint a scene a certain color, she has several different ways she can do that, " he says. " LaTanya 's very demanding as an actor. She does n't want to give a false performance. LaTanya knows this is live and she 's got to give this audience the truth for two and a half hours. " # In the new production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon is eager to see his cast reinterpret Hansberry 's masterpiece, which he considers one of the top five great American plays. Says Leon, " It 's pretty amazing when you think about the source of this play that keeps on giving : A 27-year-old African-American woman wrote this story and a few years later she 's gone. " Sad but true : Hansberry, who died at age 34 in 1965, did not see many incarnations of her great work. But each revival lets actors breathe new life into her words. " We 're all so very different, and this will be a different production, " says Anika Noni Rose, who plays Beneatha, the career-driven daughter determined to become a doctor. The role has been played by celebrated actresses like Diana Sands, but Rose is n't worried about the pressure. " There 's a list of people who 've done it before, and I 'm thankful for all of them because they 've kept it alive and kept it present. Now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a Tony in 2004 for Caroline, or Change. She says Beneatha is feisty like her, but what really resonated was her character 's desire to explore the world without limitations. " Women of color are so often told that that 's not what we 're supposed to be able to do, " says Rose. " Beneatha does n't have a lane. She 's like, ' This whole highway is me. ' " # Coming onboard the play was Sophie Okonedo 's first encounter with Raisin. Born and bred in England, she had never seen a production, but after being asked to read for the part of Ruth, Walter Lee 's contented wife, she fell in love with the timeless story and, Okonedo playfully adds, " I 'm not going to turn down a part playing opposite Denzel, whatever it was. " This is the 45-year-old actress 's Broadway debut, but the Oscar nominee for Hotel Rwanda is by no means a rookie : She knows great work when she reads it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, the more you can see the holes in them, " she says. " That is n't the case here. The more I read it, the better it gets. It 's an incredibly human play. Political as well. All the parts are so real. " # Leon agrees : " This play deals with the American dream. Since I did that production ten years ago, we 've had a Black president, we 've had Trayvon Martin, we 've had the Tea Party. So what does all that say about the dream deferred? Are we living the dream yet? Are we there yet? Or are we still put on hold? " # Ben Viera( @black galfound) is a New York journalist.
