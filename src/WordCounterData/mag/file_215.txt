2025941 Canadian artist Alan Bateman uses layers of acrylic washes to heighten contrast and achieve stunning realism. <p> Alan Bateman, son of famed wildlife artist Robert Bateman, is n't certain whether he was born with talent or whether he acquired it hanging around his father 's studio. Early in his career, he realized he did n't share his father 's passion for painting wildlife and instead chose subject matter closer to his Nova Scotia farm home. However, he and his father do share some of the same painting techniques, including using many layers of washes. <p> Alan Bateman begins an acrylic painting as a series of 2 " -x-3 " sketches ; each may take only 30 seconds. He focuses on composition and contrast and calls them " little portraits of what light is doing. " <p> Once he 's chosen the composition he feels will work best, he pencils it in lightly with graphite on a smooth piece of gessoed Masonite toned with cadmium red.( Often he 'll use thread and a pen to work out vanishing points in the drawing because, as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. ") Then, working flat, he picks up a fairly big brush and scrubs in the paint. " Some areas of the painting may be finished in the first 30 seconds if I scrub it in right, " he notes. " In others, there may be 50 different washes. I fool around, putting on different washes until something pops out. I work out my colors on the painting itself. I keep looking and adjusting. The process involves a lot of steps forward and a lot of steps backward. I 'm constantly changing tones, equalizing. And maybe, without the mistakes, it could be done with fewer layers. But all those layers build a nice quality of translucency. " <p> Occasionally, he scrapes off a layer of paint with a razor blade. During the early stages, if he finds the initial drawing is n't right, he uses alcohol applied with a rag or sponge to dissolve the paint and graphite, a step that saves him from repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks a painting is n't going well, he applies an overall wash of raw sienna, burnt sienna, or yellow ochre. " It gives the work a lift, a sunnier appeal, even if there 's a lot of blue, " he explains. " And invariably, warming it up also makes me feel better about the painting. Then I go back and make the lights and darks more crisp. " <p> The last step in the long process of washes is a dark overall wash, then picking out the highlights. Once a painting has dried, he sprays it with a gloss varnish to counteract the tendency of dark acrylic colors to dry to a matte finish. <p> Although he rarely approaches a painting thinking first of his palette, Bateman definitely prefers warm colors. His palette is composed of burnt umber, ultramarine blue, Payne 's gray, cadmium red medium or deep, cadmium yellow deep, Hooker 's green, raw sienna, burnt sienna, and titanium white. Generally, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He squeezes his paint from the tubes into about a dozen canisters attached to his mixing palette. Between painting sessions, he places the palette on a piece of damp foam rubber and seals both in a Tupperware container. <p> " I definitely like something that has a bit of contrast. " the artist explains. " For instance, if I 'm painting a sheet on a clothesline, I exaggerate the background colors for vibrancy. I just did a painting of a pumpkin on a bench and the background, which is about 60 percent of the painting, is straight black. I like the way things seem to appear and disappear in paintings by Vermeer and Rembrandt, so in my newer works, I 've been losing things in the shadows. There is always something happening in the shadows. You ca n't ignore them. You have to figure out what the shadow colors are and observe the reflected light bouncing into them. " <p> Bateman starts his paintings with big, coarse brushes. As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a master of creating texture and will use anything, including his thumb, to move paint around and create a mark. A favorite tool is a stenciling brush with the head about the circumference of a dime. He uses it to create the short, stubby texture of grass. He also uses a cheap camel-hair brush, squashed straight down and flared out, to produce a similar effect. Another technique Bateman uses for grass is to scrub in a light green and then, when that is dry, go over it with black. While the black paint is still tacky, he takes the wooden end of a brush to scratch out blades of light green grass. The same method is used for painting wood grain in shadowed areas. It works best, he says, with contrasting colors. Other tools to achieve textural effects are a razor blade to incise white lines, sandpaper to remove paint, pencils and erasers to lift highlights out of wet washes, and small squares of dampened synthetic foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the advantages of being Robert Bateman 's son? " It 's gotten me the kind of advertising you ca n't buy, " he admits. " The Bateman name might bring people into a show, but it wo n't get them to pay for a painting they do n't like. " <p> Bateman is represented by the McNaught Gallery in Hamilton, Ontario ; Beckett Fine Arts in Toronto ; Zwickers Gallery in Halifax, Nova Scotia ; and West End Gallery in Edmondton, Alberta.
