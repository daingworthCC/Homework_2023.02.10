4109741 Experienced cruisers know it 's better not to be tied to tight schedules. <p> Deadlines are a pain ; I know. As a writer, I 've been dealing with them for, well, let 's just say many years now. But those are easy. The deadlines that cause problems are those on the water, when we think we have to get somewhere by a certain time for a variety of reasons : our vacation is running out, we 're picking up or dropping off a crew member, we 're on a delivery, whatever. <p> All this came up recently when I was talking with some serious boat owners at the first Cruisers University in Baltimore 's Inner Harbor, co-sponsored by Motor Boating and our sister publication Cruising World. Time, they universally agreed, is the enemy of safe and comfortable cruising - time, that is, in the sense of timetables, deadlines and hard-and-fast schedules. <p> I once cruised the East Coast from Miami to Maine in four days on a Tempest 38, flying low. I 've done the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Grand Banks, slow and easy. Either way, my crew and I were going with the flow. We ended up each day where we ended up - subject to all the normal boating factors of weather, sea conditions, range and fueling stops( on the Tempest, not the Grand Banks) and our own physical and mental conditions at the time. Unless your goal is just a modest day trip, any cruise you undertake will be subject to too many variables to make a timetable a safe bet. There are times when you 'll just want to stay where you are. <p> My favorite conversation in Baltimore was comparing destinations around Newport, Rhode Island, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with an experienced cruising couple. Years ago, they said they made detailed schedules for their annual two-week vacation : Monday was Cuttyhunk, Massachusetts, Tuesday was Edgartown, Wednesday was Nantucket. Now, they just say they 're going cruising for 14 days.
