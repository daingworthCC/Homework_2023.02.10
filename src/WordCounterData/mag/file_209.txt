2025341 She has been called an angel and an archfiend. She has been credited with superhuman qualities of generosity and devotion, but she has also been charged -- in public print -- with almost every crime in the book. One writer said she was the wicked " witch woman of the West, " but another said that if she " had been White and a man, she would have been president. " To Delilah Beasley, she was " a modern Queen Esther " in disguise. To J. Lloyd Conrich or, rather, to some of his informants, she was " a latter-day female version of Robin Hood. " To J. A. Rogers, she was " the Superwoman of the Gold Rush. " To Helen Holdredge, she was a voodoo queen who possessed " the boldness of Evita Peron, the lawlessness of Lucretia Borgia, and the acumen of Hetty Green. " Such, in part and in sum, are the widely varying assessments of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a bold Black pioneer who was one of the most enigmatic and mysterious women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us here, at the very beginning, are : Were these writers talking about the same woman, or were there two Mary Ellen Pleasants? And if the writers were talking about the same person, who was right? Was she a public menace or a public benefactor -- or was she both? This is a two-part essay toward an understanding of the questions and the woman. But before introducing her, we must clear up a misunderstanding. It is customary, even in sympathetic circles, to call this fascinating woman " Mammy " Pleasant. Mary Ellen Pleasant protested against this literary abomination in her lifetime, and we shall not use it here. For the best way to lose sight of the woman is to speak patronizingly of " Mammy " Pleasant. Mary Ellen Pleasant was a mother to thousands of troubled women and put-upon men and children -- but she was nobody 's mammy. She was, as she told a census taker in 1890, a " capitalist " by profession, and her name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing to do here is to get out of the way and let her introduce herself. Here is part of an interview she gave in 1901 when she was 87 years old and when she scarcely, reporter Isabel Fraser said, looked 50. Listen : I do n't like to be called mammy by everybody. Put that down. I 'm not mammy to everybody in California I got a letter today from a minister in Sacramento. It was addressed to Mammy Pleasant. I wrote back to him on his own paper that my name was Mrs. Mary E. Pleasant. I would n't waste any of my paper on him. The letter was n't in the house fifteen minutes. I sent it right back to him unread. Between you and me, I do n't care anything about it, but they sha n't do it -- they sha n't nickname me at my age. If he did n't have better sense he should have had better manners.... " This was the voice, this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fantasy life of San Francisco for so many years. For almost 50 years, from the day of gold to the eve of the earthquake, she was a shaping, moving, energizing force at the highest levels of commerce and activity. " Black or White, " one writer said, " no other woman in this State ever had the confidence of so many of its prominent men.... " For many years, another writer said, she has been " the most discussed woman in San Francisco.... She has been called a pauper, then a millionaire, a devout Catholic, a Methodist, a leader among the Baptists, the essence of truth and a perjurer, a friend of the poor, and a woman who turned every human passion and foible to her own advantage.... Mary Ellen Pleasant, for that is her correct name, has been all, and at the same time, none of these things.... " Known and yet unknown, a mystery who unfolded in the high noon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one level, a great magician who had the rare ability to make people see what she wanted them to see or, better, what they wanted to see. It is necessary, therefore, for us to make a special effort at this point to establish a foundation of facts from which to view the fog of myths that hide her. Leaving aside for the moment the difficult question of her origin, let us note simply that almost everyone agrees that she settled in San Francisco during the Gold Rush and made a fortune by speculating in the stock market and by operating a string of ultra-fashionable boarding houses. While she was doing this with her left hand, she was supporting, with her right, the struggle for Black liberation, aiding and hiding fugitive slaves, and challenging the Jim Crow laws of California. In her spare time, she busied herself with the problems of women, supporting and sustaining a long line of Black and White protegees, matching and, some said, mismatching unattached females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protegees, she was involved in numerous legal fights, including a notorious case in which a celebrated beauty named Sarah Althea Hill charged one of the richest and most powerful men in the United States -- former U.S. Sen. William Sharon -- with refusing to honor an alleged marriage contract. There are differences of emphasis here and there, but these facts are admitted by almost everyone. It is admitted also that Mary Ellen Pleasant met in the course of these activities two people who played a central role in the last phases of her life. One was Thomas Bell, a multimillionaire who was a co-founder of the first Bank of California and the Quicksilver King of the West. No one knows -- and no one will ever know -- what was the real nature of the relationship between Thomas Bell and Mary Ellen Pleasant -- was it sexual or financial, or was it both? -- but there is not the slightest question that he thought she was the best businessman he had ever met. The second person was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy. She was one of Pleasant 's protegees, and in 1879 she married Thomas Bell. After a few months, the bride and bridegroom settled down in a 30-room mansion that had been designed by Mary Ellen Pleasant. The Bell or, with equal truth, the Pleasant mansion was, by any standard, a strange place. Teresa Bell went her way, and Thomas Bell went his way, and Mary Ellen Pleasant mediated between them. All money matters between Thomas Bell and Mrs. Thomas Bell were handled by Mary Ellen Pleasant, who bought the groceries, hired and fired the servants, selected Mrs. Bell 's dresses and decided where she could go and what she could do. It was said in some circles that Mary Pleasant was the housekeeper of the Bell family, but no one believed this, really, for she did n't act like a servant and she did n't talk like a servant. Why, then, was she there? Mary Pleasant, who was contemptuous of public opinion, seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge, by way of explanation, that " Mr. Bell... knew what I was there for, and I knew what I was there for. " This, of course, explained everything -- and nothing. And it explains, in part, what happened next. In their bewilderment, San Franciscans created all kinds of myths in a desperate effort to make the facts fit some recognizable pattern. It was said that Mary Ellen Pleasant dominated the Bells by voodoo, that her power stemmed from blackmail, and that she trafficked in prostitution and sold babies. At the height of the speculation, on a rainy night in October, 1892, Thomas Bell fell or jumped or was pushed from the railing of the stairs in the house that Mary Ellen Pleasant built. A coroner 's jury ruled that his death was accidental, and he was buried in a grave in a plot owned by Pleasant. These, then, are the facts, and it was on the foundation of these facts that the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in essence, five charges or elements in the case : murder, blackmail, operating a house of prostitution, fraud and intimidation by the use of voodoo or, as they said, revealingly, in those days, " the black arts. " Now, it is an axiom of law and forensics that you ca n't prove a negative. And since it is difficult to prove that Mary Ellen Pleasant, or anyone else, did not commit a certain act, the burden of proof is on the shoulders of the literary prosecution to prove by credible evidence that there is a strong reason for thinking she should have been indicted for committing certain acts. The key word in this sentence is credible, which means, in this context, documentary evidence corroborated by the testimony of at least two independent witnesses. This excludes hearsay evidence and the testimony of Mary Ellen Pleasant 's enemies, and the accomplices of her enemies. And so, to the question : What is the evidence against Mary Ellen Pleasant? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever compendium of fiction, fantasy and hearsay. What is astonishing really and worthy of long thought is that the Pleasant prosecution makes no serious effort to document its charges. There seems, in fact, to be an unspoken agreement that dead Black women have no rights reporters and writers are bound to respect. Since we are not prophets, we do not rule out the remote possibility that there is some serious evidence out there. But, if such evidence exists, no one has bothered to present it. Astonishingly enough, the principal witnesses against Mary Ellen Pleasant are a mentally disturbed White woman and a brilliant Black reporter, both of whom were engaged in a conspiracy to destroy Mary Ellen Pleasant and defame her memory. The White woman was, not surprisingly, Teresa Bell, the former protegee. In the years between 1897 and 1899, Teresa Bell made the familiar psychiatric transfer from total dependence on Mary Pleasant to total hatred of Mary Pleasant, whom she vowed to destroy, even beyond the grave. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again she reviles Pleasant, calling her " Black Melissy, " " old she-devil, " " the lyar sic of the century " -- in a diary that is one of the truly depressing documents of American historiography. " What I 've seen of these maniacal rantings, " J. Lloyd Conrich writes, "... is mostly worthless except as an exploration of this woman 's highly confused mind.... Most of her writings are highly unreliable, being snatches and figments of her imagination, deliberate misstatements and wild dreams.... " The situation is, if anything, worse than Conrich reports. For the diaries at the San Francisco Public Library have other limitations, including the fact that several pages and parts of pages have been cut out with a razor blade or some other sharp instrument. There can be no doubt from these diaries that Teresa Bell was severely disturbed mentally. And it is not at all surprising that a San Francisco court agreed with her children, or her alleged children, who contested her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings on this petition, attorneys for the children offered witnesses, including medical doctors, to prove three main points : 1) That Teresa Bell had hallucinations that she could float through the air and behold the bodies of the dead beneath her and that she said that she had floated over New York City ; 2) That Teresa Bell had hallucinations that she could light the gas by a wave of her hand " without use of match or flame " ; 3) That Teresa Bell was " a habitual paregoric drinker. " Whatever the truth of these charges, it is a matter of record that a San Francisco court accepted them and ruled that Teresa Bell was mentally incompetent when she executed her will. And it is clear from all this, or it should be clear, that Teresa Bell is not a competent witness against Mary Ellen Pleasant. The same thing can be said of her chief ally, James E. Brown Jr. Teresa Bell said Brown was " as crooked as his legs. " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other witnesses, including a relative, Charlotte Dennis Downs, who said that " James E. Brown Jr. was a bad and dangerous man who had a hold over Teresa Bell for she paid him $500 a month as long as he lived. "( *) What did James Brown have on Teresa Bell? What did he know? This is a fascinating question, but we can not, unfortunately, pursue it here because of limitations of space and time. It is worth noting, however, that Teresa Bell later turned on Brown and attempted, according to author Helen Holdredge, to kill him. She said that " when Brown went to the Laidly street house one day, after he had been there several times to collect money, Teresa told him to hang his coat in the closet. The floor of the closet had been removed by Teresa and when he stepped inside in the dark he fell clear to the basement. He survived but was a horrible cripple.... "( *) To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say here that this is not sufficient evidence to " convict " either Teresa Bell or James Brown. It is cited here, along with corroborating evidence, to show that neither James E. Brown Jr., nor Teresa Bell is a competent witness against Pleasant. If we eliminate -- as we must -- their testimony, and the hearsay evidence, the case against Mary Ellen Pleasant disappears into thin air. We can see this clearly if we look for a moment at the evidence in two or three areas, beginning with voodoo. It is said by certain writers that Mary Ellen Pleasant made herself the " Voodoo Queen of San Francisco, " that she conducted voodoo ceremonies in her homes and in the home of Thomas Bell and that she used her voodoo skills to entice, entrap and overawe several Whites, including former Senator Sharon who died, one writer said, after she " willed him to death. " What is the evidence for these charges? There is no hard evidence, which is surprising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many members of the San Francisco Black community -- some 1,800 in 1890 -- were Mary Ellen Pleasant 's voodoo disciples. Surely, if this charge is true, someone could have found, over a period of 125 years, at least one or two persons who were willing to give a firsthand account of her involvement for either money or revenge. No such person is cited. We are told, to be sure, that the evidence in the Sharon trial proved that she practiced voodoo. But this is not true. In the first place, as anyone who has studied that trial knows, the Sharon case was such an orgy of perjury and counter-perjury that it can not be cited to prove anything, except that two ruthless and well-financed adversaries can buy testimony to prove anything. Secondly, the testimony in the Sharon case was to the general effect that Sarah Althea Hill, on the advice of several Black and White fortune-tellers -- some of these witnesses said later that it had proved enormously difficult to collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used charms and voodoo dust in attempts to " steal " Sharon 's love -- a charge Sarah Althea Hill indignantly denied. Surprisingly, and revealingly, the Sharon forces made only a half-hearted attempt to link Pleasant with these practices, and the attempt failed. The real source of the Queen of the Voodoo charge is neither the report of eyewitnesses, nor the Sharon trial record -- the real source is an article published in the San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday, July 9, 1899. The article was unsigned and had a big, full-page headline : THE QUEEN OF THE VOODOOS. The writer made no attempt to support the headline, merely observing, in passing, that " suspicious " articles( powdered cork dust, singed feathers, and strips of calico cloth) were found in Pleasant 's rooms after she had been forced to leave the Bell/Pleasant mansion.( The source here was indisputably Teresa Bell and/or her allies.) The writer next alluded to the Sharon case and then went on to his main point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had fraudulently appropriated the estates of several Black families. The interesting fact about this article -- a fact never before revealed -- is that it was not a regular newspaper production but a deliberate plant written or arranged by Teresa Bell 's ally, James E. Brown Jr. Two days before the article appeared, Teresa Bell noted in her diary : " James E. Brown came and told me of his articles on MEP Mary Ellen Pleasant, her life and wicked ways in general. " On the day the article appeared, she made another notation : " Brown 's article on M E Pleasant together with a good photo of her was in the Chronicle.... " So much for the integrity of a cornerstone document of the voodoo party. So much also for the tedious and implausible voodoo stories -- stories that were created in the first place not to define Mary Ellen Pleasant but to titillate the sensibilities of readers who find it difficult to resist a good sex story seasoned with vague and apocalyptic references to " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-Pleasant mythology is sex, which informs every detail and leers at the bottom of every indictment. And we must pay special attention at this point to the charge of pandering, which makes the implicit explicit, focusing and fusing the two unique elements in the Pleasant equation : the sexual image of the Black woman and the sexual appetites of a city that, in the beginning, was largely a city of men without women. With relish, and reckless abandon, writer after writer charges that Mary Ellen Pleasant took advantage of this situation and became one of San Francisco 's major madams. Little or no attempt is made to sustain this charge, for even the most rabid anti-Pleasant partisan concedes that running whorehouses was n't her style. And so, by a devious shift, which most readers miss, the writers segue into a second line of attack, saying that she either leased property to people who ran houses of prostitution or she hired madams -- Black and White -- to run houses for her. Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- she never went near these houses. And since she was so clever, and had so much clout with officials, some of whom she was blackmailing, she was never linked -- the indictment charges -- with these houses. This is clever, very clever, and very damning, for what is happening here is that the very absence of evidence is being cited as evidence against Mary Pleasant. This is also the view of leading scholars who have examined the evidence. " Beyond conjecture, " historian Jesse Warr writes, "... there is no evidence of involvement in prostitution. It is all innuendo.... Without a public confession, furtive diary entries by ex-Jezebels, court documents, or police records, insinuation is the level on which " Mammy 's " connection with prostitution must always remain. " And when we turn from prostitution to blackmail, when we examine the vague and constantly repeated charges that Mrs. Pleasant used information to intimidate officials and enrich her coffers, we find the same barren field of gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feared in San Francisco because she knew all the skeletons in the closets of the elite. That may be true, but knowing is not a crime. And there is no hard evidence that Pleasant demanded and/or received money for her silence.( She apparently made several men support their illegitimate children, but she did n't consider that a crime, and neither do I.) In fact, the evidence goes all the other way, and writer after writer, testifies that she was " as faithful a custodian of secrets as the grave itself.... " It is customary in this area, as in others, for writers to casually and positively say that Mary Ellen Pleasant was a blackmailer. And then, in almost the same sentence, they back away from the charge, softening it, qualifying it, asserting in one way or another that she never made a direct demand for money but that she sent -- not often, one writer says, but at discreet intervals -- to the houses of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for donations to her favorite charities. This procedure -- the sleight-of-hand of the writers, not the requests for donations -- is damnable, and writers should either make specific charges and present evidence or they should stop playing with the reputation of a remarkable, though perhaps not faultless, woman. And who, pray tell, was/is faultless? It is to be observed too in this connection that some writers contend that Mrs. Pleasant organized orgies. Here again the evidence cited is gossip and hearsay. There is, for example, the remarkable testimony of William( Blind Billy) Tomlinson, who was quoted by a hearsay witness as saying that Pleasant held " terrible orgies " at one of her houses and " horrible " orgies at the Bell/Pleasant mansion.( *) Blind Billy, according to the hearsay witness, said that " as a voodoo queen, Mammy had horrible orgies in the basement at Octavia. They sang voodoo songs while Mammy stood on a box with a snake and made the calls. " This citation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " virtually " blind and was accompanied almost everywhere by a police dog. This case alone should warn us that we are dealing with demonology and not reality. It is against this background, mythological in its essence, that we must view the final charge of murder. The principal witness here again is Teresa Bell, who was obsessed by death and morbid hallucinations about death. One of her wildest hallucinations was structured around the number 49. She was convinced that Mrs. Pleasant owned 49 lots in the graveyard and had already killed 48 persons. There was only one grave left, Teresa Bell believed or said she believed, and that grave was destined for her. Strangely enough, according to Teresa Bell, many of the 48 persons slain by Mrs. Pleasant had been killed at her home at 49 Clara Street and -- get this -- had been killed in their 49th year. The strongest -- and the weakest -- case in the Pleasant demonology is the case of Thomas E. Bell, who, as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs of his home on October 15, 1892. At the time of his death, no one -- neither Teresa Bell, nor the Bell children, nor the San Francisco papers, nor the San Francisco police -- raised questions about possible foul play. It was, if we can credit the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Call, and the San Francisco Examiner, an open-and-shut case. All witnesses in the house at the time -- Mary Ellen Pleasant, Thomas Bell 's son, Fred, and " the colored servants " -- told, the three papers said, the same story. Bell, who had been ill for some time, retired about 8:30 p.m. Pleasant and Fred Bell went to their rooms 30 minutes later. At 10:30 or thereabouts, there was a loud cry : " Where am I? " Immediately afterwards, there was a noise and sickening thud. The butler and the servants rushed to the back of the house and found Bell sprawled on the uncovered floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above, a distance of some 20 feet. The servants ran upstairs and awakened Pleasant and Fred, and " the wild alarm, " the San Francisco Examiner said, " took both to the old gentleman 's sleeping room on the run. " The newspaper continued : " It was not until the vacant apartment was reached that they comprehended the stammered explanations of the frightened servants, and took the right course to the bleeding and seemingly lifeless body. " The veteran housekeeper detected signs of life, however, and busied herself with procuring pillows and blankets, while Fred Bell ran for Dr. R. W. Murphy, the nearest physician. Dr. P. W. Kearney of 513 Folsom Street, who has been attending Mr. Bell, was telephoned for also, and he arrived a few minutes after Dr. Murphy had the unconscious man carried back to his bedroom. " The two physicians first directed their attention to rousing Mr. Bell from his deep stupor, but all the resources at hand failed and they devoted themselves to a diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no fracture of the skull could be discovered.... " Bell did not regain consciousness and died at 1:30. The only persons present at that time, the papers said, were Fred Bell, Pleasant and the two physicians. Teresa Bell, the papers noted, was at her ranch in Sonoma County. The deputy coroner came to the house early the next morning to investigate the death. He interviewed Fred Bell, Pleasant, and the servants. Pleasant told substantially the same story she related to a reporter of the Examiner : " Mr. Bell had been ailing for about two months now, and has been in bed since last Monday. He was badly run down, the doctor said, and besides he had a trouble of the skin that just kept him in torture. Twenty minutes before 10 o'clock last night he got up without calling anyone and went to the bathroom which is close to his chamber on the upper floor.... From there he must have started to go downstairs. There are two winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the bottom of the top flight we found the blanket which I always left on the foot of the bed for him to throw over his shoulders when he arose in the night. " Of course, we do n't know just how the accident happened -- nobody knows that -- but we think Mr. Bell must have been dazed when he started down to the kitchen. I think he got to the bottom of the upper flight and then fell over the railing from the first step. There the railing is low, and it would be easy to fall from the stairs. His mind had been all right, and if there was anything the matter last night it was a sort of dazed feeling, or perhaps a nightmare that came on after he got up or while he was sleeping. Probably, or undoubtedly, I should say, it was a result of his sickness. " Two days later, on October 18, an inquest was held at the Bell home. Fred Bell testified. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. W. Murphy, and " the colored servants. " Although the widow was in the house, she did not testify and did not raise any questions or objections. The coroner 's jury ruled that Bell 's death was caused " by falling over the balustrade of his residence " and " that his death was entirely accidental. " There were no further developments in the case until years later when Teresa Bell broke with Pleasant. As their relationship deteriorated, and as they vied for position in a bitter and protracted legal fight over the disposition of the Bell property, Teresa Bell began to elaborate a new and sensational story of how Pleasant pushed Thomas Bell over the railing. She claimed in a diary notation of May 7, 1899 -- seven years after the event -- that Fred Bell had changed his story and had related suspicious acts of Pleasant after the fall. Seven years later, and two years after Pleasant 's death, she added the most revolting charge in the anti-Pleasant mythology, writing that two servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his fall " after Mrs. Pleasant " had put her fingers in the hole in the top of his head and pulled out the protruding brains.... " This evidence is obviously unacceptable, not only because of the source and the lack of corroboration by other evidence, including the published reports of the doctors who said Bell died several hours later. If you reread the San Francisco Examiner report of the death, you will notice that the two doctors certified that there was " concussion of the brain... but no fracture of the skull could be discovered. " If, as seems arguable, it is impossible to pull anything out of a solid skull, Teresa Bell 's story is either hallucination or a cold-blooded attempt to posthumously frame Mary Ellen Pleasant for murder. This is not mere speculation. For as early as 1899 -- the year of the greening of the Mary Ellen Pleasant legend -- Teresa Bell and her co-conspirators were manipulating the San Francisco press in an ultimately successful effort to tarnish Pleasant 's character. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and documents.( " JEB, " Bell wrote on Sunday, August 27, " told me yesterday he had all of MEP papers and knew everything.... ") In the same year, or immediately after Pleasant died in January, 1904, her diary disappeared. Then Teresa Bell gave her diaries to a San Francisco newspaperman. From 1900 until her death in 1922, Bell was indefatigable in pursuit of her dead enemy. Under these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the anti-Pleasant mythology gained currency and was amplified in the telling. Even Blind Billy got into the act, regaling reporters with tall tales of how Mrs. Pleasant 's " plaid blanket " implicated her in the murder of Thomas Bell. As the rumors proliferated, the public mind fastened on the story of the blanket, sometimes described as red, sometimes described as plaid, sometimes described as a shawl of different and contradictory colors. In a marvelous spoof of this lunacy, J. Lloyd Conrich said that in some stories the shawl or blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in others it was " found under Bell 's body. " As for Mary Ellen Pleasant, the different versions of the story placed her " at the foot of the stairs, on the second floor, the third floor and on each step in between as well as in the bed alone, with a man, with a woman, awake, asleep, nude, fully clothed, in a trance, staring into a hypnotized snake 's eyes and what not. " Needless to say, serious scholars discount these and other wild stories about Pleasant. Francis N. Lortie Jr., who is not by any means an ardent Pleasant partisan, says that " Helen Holdredge... accuses Mary of murdering Thomas Bell and three other men who got in her way, of being implicated in at least four other murders, and attempting twice to kill Frederick Bell, Thomas ' foster son.... Miss Holdredge also maintains Mary held numerous voodoo ceremonies in order to bring the Negroes of the city under her complete control. Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible is Mary 's support of Sarah Hill during the divorce trial. "( *) Where does all this leave the case against Mary Pleasant? The lack of evidence, the opinion of scholars, and the existence of a conspiracy to defame and destroy : all this argues powerfully for the view that there is no case against Mary Ellen Pleasant. The case rather is against the people who tried to steal the meaning of her life and who may have been responsible for her death.( Mrs. Fred DeLacca, granddaughter of the woman who befriended Mrs. Pleasant in her last hours, told me her grandmother believed that someone had hastened Pleasant 's death by poisoning her while she lay dying in a cold and deserted flat.) As one would expect, there is considerable resistance to this view, even among people who readily concede that there is no hard evidence against Mrs. Pleasant. The temptation, even for fair men and women, even for scholars, is to say that where there is so much smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily true, for the presence of smoke is an argument either for fire or a smoke-making machine. In the second installment of this inquiry, we will deal at greater length with the smoke-making machine -- the anti-Pleasant conspiracy -- as we grapple with the difficult question of who Mary Ellen Pleasant really was. * There are no serious full-length studies of Mary Ellen Pleasant. The best assessments of this remarkable woman are in unpublished manuscripts and old newspaper articles which are, unfortunately, unavailable to the general public.
