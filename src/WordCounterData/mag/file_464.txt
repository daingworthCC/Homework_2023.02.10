4075841 HELP FROM THE GH RESEARCH INSTITUTE ASK OUR EXPERT Q : I 'd like to start making compost for my garden, but it seems like a lot of work. Any tips? A : The most common( and free!) way to create compost, a nutrient-rich natural fertilizer made from food and yard waste, is digging an outdoor pit. That requires at least twice-monthly churning with a pitchfork, can take up a bit of yard space, and may also attract pests. A compost tumbler( $100-plus) is less messy and simpler -- a crank or other mechanism makes mixing easy -- and provides compost in about a month( pits can take three or more). You can compost all food scraps( except meat, fish, and dairy -- eggshells are fine), as well as leaves and herbicide-free grass clippings, but do n't add weeds -- their seeds may not break down, and you 'll just replant them when you use the compost. TIP Spread compost around plants in your garden one to two inches deep. Mix it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of mulch. GH TO THE RESCUE Lost Sleep Over Missing Parts PROBLEM We ordered a trundle bed for our daughter from Pottery Barn Kids last spring. The delivery men discovered that important pieces were missing, including two of the four feet that lift up the bed so the trundle piece can fit underneath. We were assured that the parts would arrive in four to six weeks. Eight weeks later, I was told that the pieces were back-ordered but would come within a month. A month after that, the pieces were " out of stock, " but would be delivered -- in another six to eight weeks. Two months later, I received a letter stating that the parts still had n't arrived. Two more months have passed since then, and all I 've received are form letters telling me of another delay. Meanwhile, I have a mattress in our office, the trundle against the wall in our living room, and a disappointed 5-year-old. -- Melissa Crowley, Fairfax, VA SOLUTION We spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one problem we can put to bed.

DIY FURNITURE-ASSEMBLY TIPS Work on a carpet, or lay down a blanket, to avoid scratching the floor or the furniture( and make dropped bolts less likely to roll away). Read the instructions before starting -- yes, really. As you go through, label the parts with sticky notes so you wo n't mix them up. Divvy up the hardware in an ice-cube tray or egg carton.

When propane rates went up, some major suppliers did n't raise the price ; instead, they 're giving 15 pounds per tank, not 17.
