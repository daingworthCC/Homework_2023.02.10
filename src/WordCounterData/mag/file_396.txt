4024341 With her star on the rise, the young actress is proving she 's got all the right moves -- in Hollywood and on the ballroom dance floor TEXT BY ANNEMARIE IVERSON It 's a coming-out party if there ever was one. Jessica Biel knows that Hollywood and Seventh Avenue go hand in hand. Yet the " fashion thing " did n't always come easily to this Colorado tomboy. " I literally wore Umbro shorts, No Fear T-shirts, and sneakers until I was, like, 15, " Jessica explains. " I did n't care, and my mom did n't care. I did n't have fashion icons. I looked up to soccer player Mia Hamm. " Though the 26-year-old star is still happiest in her size-26 7 for All Mankind jeans, Jessica is dipping her toes into designer territory, surrounding herself with the most extravagant gowns from the American fall runways. On a normal day, she rarely ventures out of her comfy Uggs, so it 's not surprising that instead of diving into the clothing racks on set at Bazaar 's shoot, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body for the dances she 's about to perform. " I 'm fascinated with the fashion world because I feel sort of intimidated, " she says. " I feel like a kid with saucer eyes, soaking it all in and having the time of my life.

" She has an easy way about her and good energy, which, in Hollywood terms, is refreshing, " says Vera Wang. Zac Posen, who, at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Ford tux and vintage ' 30s cuff links and shirt studs to waltz with the actress. " I like the romanticism of formality. I could wear tuxes all day long. Jessica seems like a strong, powerful woman, " he says. " She 's an amazing dancer ; she made me relax, " recalls Calvin Klein designer Francisco Costa, who, despite his Latino roots, felt trepidation about performing the paso doble. Oscar de la Renta did the cha-cha easily with his partner, his dress transforming her into a ' 50s starlet. Diane von Furstenberg and Jessica managed the Charleston breathlessly, the actress now, according to the designer, " a Marlene Dietrich flapper " in her rhinestone-studded black sheath. A week later, over dinner at an outdoor table at Saluda 's restaurant in Columbia, South Carolina( where she 's filming the upcoming political comedy Nailed, costarring Jake Gyllenhaal), Jessica, dressed in a gray hoodie, jeans, and white Roger Vivier pumps -- a splurge from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoot. " They were all so wonderfully unique, " she says of the designers, way too smart to pick favorites, though she clearly loved Wang 's sisterly attitude. " She really had a fantastic personality, " declares Jessica. " I felt like I just wanted advice from her : ' Anything you can think of, tell me! ' That 's sort of someone who can become a close friend of mine -- fun, exuberant, and creative. " : The actress and Zac Posen waltz the night away. Gown, price upon request, Zac Posen. zacposen.com.

Over the last several years, Jessica has reinvented herself rather dramatically from a television personality -- whose image was largely frozen in people 's minds as Mary Camden in the long-running family drama 7th Heaven -- into a serious A-list actress. The turning point was her 2006 performance in The Illusionist, in which she played a turn-of-the-last-century duchess opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's never been more in demand. Powder Blue, due out this winter, also starring Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, will see Jessica strut her stuff as a single-mom stripper. David O. Russell 's buzzed-about Nailed casts Jessica as a waitress who, due to a nail stuck in her head, experiences irrepressible sexual urges. Jessica 's rising profile, not to mention her one-and-a-half-year relationship with global superstar Justin Timberlake, has led the low-key actress 's private life to be splashed onto the tabloids. And despite the fact that she has never confirmed that they are dating, when asked about the concept of marriage, she smiles before allowing, " Those things can change. You know, the actual idea of signing those papers and doing all this stuff about it, I 've never been someone who 's like, ' I have to, have to, have to have it. ' But the idea of being with somebody I care about, who 's my soul mate, that sounds groovy. " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cha-chas with Oscar de la Renta. Top( Wang 's own), Vera Wang.

Just do n't expect Jessica to be the next celebrity sporting a baby bump. While she recently was in a close friend 's birthing room( " It really changes your view of things ; it 's something that I feel is a rite of passage as a woman, " she says), work is clearly her focus right now. " I think when you make a decision to have a family and children, everything else comes second, " she continues. " But if I choose to have a family, I would hope to create a balance, because I do n't want to lose my sense of identity, my career, and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't I have everything? So many women do it. " Of course, if Jessica pursues that path, she 'll become even bigger paparazzi bait. Already her privacy and security have become a concern. " It 's terribly scary to be followed by men in cars with cameras, " Jessica says, shocked by the paparazzi 's guerrilla tactics. " It 's terrifying, you know? They 're breaking traffic laws and putting you and other people in danger. I try to follow the speed limit and be Zen about it. It 's not like I 'm doing anything exciting -- going to the dry cleaners or to Whole Foods to shop for groceries. " And while there are days when stardom is n't easy, it 's a path Jessica has been plotting since she was a child. " I had a mission as a kid. I do n't know how and I do n't know why, but I was just one of those kids who begged and begged. ' Take me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play. ' ' Take me to this audition. ' And my parents just supported it. " : Dress, $3,490, and sandals, $695, Oscar de la Renta. 212-288-5810. Bracelet, Kwiat. Tights, Donna Karan Hosiery. Menswear : de la Renta 's own.

We were always camping. My brother and I spent all of our time outside, " she says. " Playing soccer. Doing gymnastics, skiing, snowboarding. That 's really how I grew up. So for me, being athletic and active is a way of life. " For many years, the flip side of Jessica 's love of nature and sports was a small-town inferiority complex. " I felt for a long time that I was n't ballsy enough. Not cool enough. Not strong enough. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life, I 'm so thankful for the values that I had growing up, and I do n't care about that stuff anymore. I 'm not going to be the coolest or the most ballsy. And I 'm not going to be the most outspoken, and, guess what, that 's cool. That 's okay. " The big " what if " of Jessica 's life may be what would have happened if she 'd continued at Tufts( which she attended for two years), graduated, and turned into a, well, " normal " person. " I was taking a screenwriting course there, and I was sort of thinking I could see myself as a screenwriter, " she begins. " Or, I could see myself working in a gallery, you know, with beautiful art everywhere. I love photography, so really, truly, out of all the things I could see myself doing, it was being a photographer. " : Perfecting the paso doble : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8,125.

She has a habit of creating her own family wherever she lands. In Columbia, Jessica shares a house with her personal assistant and friend Lindsay Ratowsky, a onetime PA to Lindsay Lohan. Another key " girlfriend " is Jessica 's pit-bull mix, Tina, whose sweet personality, marble coat, and buff body seem to fit right in.( What is it they say about dogs and their masters?) Completing the South Carolina family tree is Russell, her **28;2507;TOOLONG driver and volunteer protector. " Russell 's the best. A Southern gentleman, " says Jessica. " But at the same time, I 'm very independent, and I 'm like, ' I 'm fine! I 'm going to walk. ' He 's like, ' You 're going to walk? I 'm going to follow you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russell is a block behind me, driving slowly. " With that, Jessica eagerly digs into her mashed potatoes and pecan-drenched grouper, though a brief standoff arises over the " European fully fatted handmade butter with a hint of honey. " When our waiter expresses disappointment over the fact that we did n't try it, Jessica suggests playfully, " You know what? We 're going to slather it all over our thighs. " However, she does n't shy away from a nouvelle-cuisine version of fried green tomatoes and does take a bite of the unsolicited oozing chocolate dessert that appears at our table. " I love the food in Columbia. I really have to hold myself back because if I had my choice, I would eat fried green tomatoes and goat cheese all day, every day. " When asked about her bombshell body, Jessica 's answer is straightforward : " I am the shape that I am. I feel no shame in it, you know what I mean? My mother always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( She thanks her mom for the tiny waistline and curvy figure.) When on location, she diligently follows her trainer 's 90-minute exercise routine four or five times a week. " If I was n't having dinner with you tonight, I 'd be home at the gym, " she admits, referring to a makeshift room in her house she 's converted for this purpose. After dinner, Jessica insists on walking home, and I pray this is n't a stubborn interview show of normalness. There is a group of drunken college kids behind us that 's been eying her all night, one of whom even approached the table on a $20 dare.( She was totally cool and polite to the Corona-drinking guy.) I try to convince her to accept a lift in my rental car : " Look, it 's just here! " But she wo n't have it. So Jessica Biel sets out down the dark sidewalk and I stand guard until she 's safely out of sight, taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too, following behind her in the car at a safe enough distance that she 'll never notice him.
