4150941 Section : Food Do you love corn? It 's healthy too. Know more about it # HOW TO BUY # Corn needs to be fresh. The husk should be bright green and the silk strands( more strands means more kernels) pale golden and a tad sticky. The stump tells how old the ear is : it takes two days to start turning brown. Pick a kernel-it should feel full ; pop it-the juice should be milky. # HOW TO STORE # The sugars in corn start converting to starch as soon as the corn is picked, so ideally, it needs to be consumed within 3 days. If you do n't intend to consume it right away, refrigerate it with the husk still on. This will slow down the sugars turning to starch. Reproduced From Prevention. Copyright 2013. LMIL.
