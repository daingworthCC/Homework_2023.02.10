2010241 Sarah Saffian always intended to search for her birth parents one day -- but they found her first. Here 's how she coped after the phone call that rocked her world. // I awaken on January 29,1993. It is less than a month until my24th birthday. It 's Friday, and I 'm looking forward to the weekend. As on most mornings before heading to my magazine job in Manhattan, I go to the gym and then return home to shower, dress, eat breakfast. At nine-fifteen, after finishing my orange juice and double-checking that I have everything I need for the day-datebook, journal, notes for an article I 'm writing-I 'm ready to go. The telephone rings. " Hello? " " Hello, is Sarah Saff an there? ' " This is Sarah. " I guess that it 's an editor, calling about freelance work. " Sarah, my name is Hannah Morgan*. I think I 'm your birth mother. " Daughter Discovered With a single phone call on an ordinary morning, my lifelong vague curiosity about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God, " I whispered. Tears sprang to my eyes as I made my way to a chair. A pause. My birth mother started to speak, her voice soft and shaky but forthright. She did n't sound like a New Yorker, an uptight urban dweller-underneath her surface unease, I sensed a core of calmness. " I 'm sorry to startle you by calling on the phone, " Hannah hesitantly began, " but I worried that if I sent a letter and got no answer, I would n't know if you had received the letter and did n't want to write back or if you had n't received the letter because I 'd written to the wrong person. " " Mm hm, " I answered, reduced for a while to one-word or one-sound responses. To ground myself, I grabbed a scrap of notepaper off my desk and scribbled down key facts while we spoke. Hannah told me that she was 21 when she gave birth to me at Staten Island Hospital and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father, Adam Leyder, attended college together, and I was conceived soon after graduation. She admitted that toward the end of the pregnancy, she began having second thoughts about giving me up but believed it was too late to change her mind. " I have another shock for you, " she said. " I married your birth father, and we have three other children " -Renee, 14 ; Lucy, 10 ; and Samuel, 6 ; my biological siblings. " Oh, that 's so wonderful, " I heard myself saying. " Then I can visit you all at once. " They lived in Hanover, New Hampshire, where Hannah worked as a potter and Adam as a draftsman. I tried to absorb this barrage of information. Then Hannah revealed the name she had given me, the one on my original birth certificate : Susan Morgan. I turned the strange name over in my head as if I were meeting a new person. Photograph Daughter 's dilemma : Should she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me about your family? " she asked next. " I feel like I 've been doing all the talking. " In the split second before responding, I considered how best to relay the most painful piece of my story. I felt oddly protective of Hannah already. I had no intention of startling or hurting her and was loath to contribute to any regrets she had about relinquishing me. At the same time, I also felt protective of my family. I did n't want to give Hannah the impression that I had grown up neglected-I had always been cared for, loved without bounds. I had to be gentle but also direct with this woman who had given me life. " Well, one important thing you should know, " I offered somewhat cautiously, " is that my mother died when I was 6. " Hannah took in a short, sharp breath. ' hat 's one of the things birth mothers always fear, that something happens to the adoptive parents, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 6 too. " I was stunned by this unexpected parallel. But I blinked and recovered, going on to explain that my father had remarried when I was 10 and he and his new wife, whom I considered Mom, had had two children together within two years, my brother and sister. I reassured Hannah that I loved my family dearly. I told her that I had known I was adopted for almost as long as I could remember and I had always planned to seek out my birth parents one day. " What do you look like? ' Hannah asked. " I have dark brown hair, wavy, about shoulder length, and green eyes.... " " Yes, I think we were told that you had green eyes. All of us but Sam have green eyes. Are you left-handed, by any chance? ' -Yes! " " I 'm left-handed. So are Lucy and Sam! " " Oh, is that genetic? ' I asked. " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your birth father is 6 feet 4. " " I 'm only 5 feet 5! What happened? ' " Well, I 'm not quite 5 feet 3. " ' Thanks alot! " We shared our first laugh. " Would it be all right if Adam called you? " Hannah asked. " I feel bad that I 'm getting to talk to you without him here. " " Why do n't I try to call him instead? " I responded. " Maybe over the weekend. " Before we hung up, Hannah asked me, " Did you ever think you would pick up the phone and it would be me? " I paused to think for a moment, then replied simply, " No, because I always assumed I would be the one making the call. " Too Much, Too Soon I carefully returned the receiver to its cradle and fixated on it for a beat. Still sitting, I took a deep breath and switched my gaze to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quiet, in that palpable way that comes after there has been loud noise. Unclear of my emotions in this moment-shock? confusion? loss? -I nonetheless felt them physically, tingling through me. After several minutes, not knowing what else to do, I wiped my eyes, pulled on my backpack, and headed out. Once at the office, I said quick, perfunctory good-mornings as I made my way to my desk, where I sat and stared at my articles, letters turning into hieroglyphs, text blurring into two fuzzy, distant columns before my unfocusing eyes. I finally broke through my trance and called my father, who was home forthe day At the first sound of his voice, I began to cry in earnest. Between sobs, I told him about Hannah 's phone call, and he said to come right over. I pleaded family emergency to my editor-the emergency being my newfound confusion about the concept of familyand left. As I walked from the subway to my parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop, the tree in front of their brownstone, all looked a bit different, as though I were seeing them for the first time. Through a kitchen window, I saw Dad sitting, waiting. Noticing me, he smiled and got up to let me in. Relief flowed through me as we hugged, and I breathed in his warm, fatherly smell of soap and coffee and cigarettes. I sat down at the table, running my hands along it, and gradually began to feel oriented again, in these **30;341;TOOLONG. My father had a look of concern but not of surprise. " So, tell me what happened. " I took him from the ring of the telephone through the entire conversation in as much detail as I could muster. I was dry-eyed, matter-of-fact, exhausted and wired at once. When I mentioned my birth name was Susan Morgan, he nodded. " Yes, I remember. ' Susan ' was one of the few things we knew. That, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you through a Jewish agency. " The confirmation quelled my fears that this woman might be an impostor or simply mistaken. As we talked, I felt deeply connected to my father, sure that he was my parent and not these strangers who had unexpectedly burst into my life. Who were they to me? He and I have always shared an especially close bond, but usually it is simply a silent understanding. Discussing my birth parents and my adoption brought our bond to the surface. Perhaps we were clinging to our connection, because this new element was potentially threatening-it did n't have a place in our world of father and daughter. After a while, I called Mom at work. I had been open with my father but cautiously so, afraid that he would feel defensive about my birth parents ' sudden emergence. With my mother I could speak more freely, because even though Hannah and Adam presented a potential threat to her as well, she was n't the one who 'd adopted me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening, however, she confessed that after hanging up, she 'd asked a friend, " Why did she have to call Sarah? Why could n't she have contacted us, so we could 've acted as intermediaries? " But as she was admitting this, I felt glad that Hannah had called me. Each of us wanted to soften the blow for the other. I decided not to call my birth parents back yet. It was too soonI needed time to digest what had happened and to decide what I wanted to do about it. But in their eagerness, they did n't afford me that space. On Monday evening, the phone rang again. " Hey, Sarah, this is Adam Leyder, your birth father. " My stomach leapt in panic. As the impact of both phone calls hit me at once, I felt not just startled but invaded. We exchanged much of the same information Hannah and I had-what we looked like, general overviews of our lives. When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for prompting these reactions and then stuttered, clearly moved, " I-I ca n't believe I 'm talking to you. I 'd drive down to New York to meet you on five minutes ' notice and leave after five minutes if that was what you wanted. " " No, please, do n't do that, not yet, " I answered, laughing shrilly in disbelief at my extreme situation. " I 'd like to visit you someday, but right now, I 'm overwhelmed even by these phone calls. " Choosing my words deliberately, I tried to let him down easily. " I ca n't have an emotional upheaval every time the phone rings. Writing letters would be much more manageable for me, just while we figure all this out. Would that be okay with you? " He asked whether I would feel comfortable sending photographs along with the letters, but I answered that I was n't even ready for that yet. He said he understood, stressing, " We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " but I thought I could sense his disappointment, his urgency deflated. The following week, I received a single white business-size envelope addressed in neat capital letters-an architect 's hand, which at first reminded me of my grandfather 's. After staring at the return address for several moments, I carefully opened the envelope to find two separate letters, typed on a computer and hand-signed. I took a deep breath and plunged in. Building ia Bond My birth parents ' letters were heartfelt, but they reflected an urgency to know me that I could not yet reciprocate. I read them repeatedly over the next several days. I carried them around, committed information to memory, analyzed the tone of certain phrases. Sometimes the sheer act of reading them made me cry. Hannah and Adam said they were encouraged rather than threatened by my close relationships with my parents. Touched by their generosity, I had the impulse to thank them. On the other hand, some of their words of love, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. While I was glad to have been spared the anxiety and frustration of detective work, I could not help but feel that by finding me first, they had robbed me of an opportunity rather than alleviated a burden.. I responded about a week later. I wrote how delicate and powerful I considered our connection to be, how carefully I wanted to proceed. They understood, allowing me to set the pace for our relationship. As we gradually opened up, our letters delved into the past, expressed anger and confusion, laid us bare, tentatively reached out with love. My defensiveness evolved into gratefulness and an expanded sense of family and identity. Three years after Hannah 's phone call, I was ready for a reunion.
