2020741 In 1990 it seemed as if Salt " N ' Pepa was on top of the world. The group 's third album, black 's Magic, had a slew of slammin ' singles on it. " Expression " had been tabbed Top Rap Single of that ear by Billboard magazine. " Let 's Talk About Sex " had been transformed into an AIDS-awareness anthem. And like their two previous platinum albums, Black 's Magic had sold more than a million copies. To this day, Salt " N ' Pepa remains the only female rap act ever to go platinum. All of which meant this : Salt " N ' Pepa were dope, large, phat, fresh, the first and the foremost, the Queens of Rap, the Highnesses of Hip-Hop. And they were miserable. Miserable on the personal front : " I was n't in the right frame of mind, " recalls Sandi( Pepa) Denton, whose boyfriend left her that year while she was pregnant with their son, Tyran, who is now 4. " I always pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen that way for me, I was depressed. " Miserable on the professional front : " People crook you -- that 's what happened to us, " says Dee Dee( Spinderella) Roper, as she describes the group 's alleged mistreatment by their record company. " In their eyes, we were three little girls that had come from the street. You know : " They ai n't got nothing -- give them crumbs and they 'll be happy. ' ' " Miserable on all fronts : " Everything, " sums up Cheryl( Salt) James, " was on the downside. " What a difference four years make. Sandi, Cheryl and Dee have all had their own baby booms. Although it has n't been easy, single-motherhood has been a big plus for all three. Sandi 's son, Tyran, was followed in 1991 by Cheryl 's daughter, Corin, who was followed by Dee Dee 's daughter, Christenese, in 1992. Furthermore, they 've all left their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gratifying satisfying men in their lives. Salt " N ' Pepa 's professional life is kickin ' now -- even harder than their babies did. After what amounted to a three-year maternity leave, the trio bounced back with their extra-large Very Necessary album, the first release under their new deal with London Records. The ladies have also made some " very necessary " behind-the-scenes changes. " We were involved in every stage of this album from songwriting to production -- everything, " says Sandi. It worked. Propelled by hits like " Shoop " and " Whatta Man "( featuring En Vogue), Very Necessary went double platinum within six months. So what does it mean? Clearly, Salt'N ' Pepa 's metamorphosis shows us that, if nothing else, life is about growth, forward motion, change. But when you look closer at their story, a far simpler truth emerges : Life is also about caring and sharing and having your buddy 's back when she needs it. As corny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a testament to the power -- and the necessity -- of friendship. When you really put all the fame and fanfare aside, Salt N ' Pepa are just three good girlfriends who knew one another back in the day. Who have been there for one another through pregnancies and failed love affairs. Through good times and bad. Sistahs. Homies. Girls. Women who have grown and are still growing. Women who, it seems, are an awful lot like us. " Women listen to our lyrics and take heed of them, " says Sandi. " The fellas think we 're sexy and cute and all that good stuff. But women listen to us. They take us seriously. " We listen because, like many of us, Salt " N ' Pepa have been there. They 've been taken advantage of at work and taken for granted at home. They 've loved and they 've lost. They know. You want to talk hurt, humiliation, heartache, depression, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Done it. Been there. And they 've lived to rap about it. And it 's a helluva tale. It began innocently enough when Sandi and Cheryl met at Queensborough Community College. Each took nursing courses. Each hung out in the cafeteria. End of similarities. Even then Sandi -- tall, solidly built and brown-skinned -- sported bleached-blonde hair and dressed like a punk rocker ; Cheryl-short, slight and lighter-toned -- was sedate and far more conservative. " I guess when they say opposites attract, that 's really true, " says Sandi. " I 'm kinda loud and outgoing, and Cheryl 's more laid-back and calm. She used to watch me in the cafeteria, and I used to watch her, too. I was like, " She 's so quiet! " And then we just hooked up. " Not long after, Cheryl helped Sandi land a part-time job at Sears with her, where they became best friends. Meanwhile another coworker at Sears -- Hurby( Luv Bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project he was doing. He convinced the duo to help out. When the project was finished, Azor played their song for his buddy Marley Marl, who, in turn, played it for some folks at Pop Art Records, who, in turn, made it into a record. That single, " The Showstoppa, " earned Sandi and Cheryl a contract with Next Plateau Records. The year was 1986, and Salt " N ' Pepa were on their way. A year later, Dee Dee, their deejay, came on board. Lest we forget : Hip-hop in the eighties was -- as it still is -- a male-dominated genre, one where women rappers were routinely disregarded, dogged or dissed. Salt " N ' Pepa brought a whole new female flavor to the mix. With their sassy, sexy, bold, fun-loving, trash-talking, take-no-prisoners attitude, the group showed that they were women, damn it, and proud of it. They knew what women wanted to hear -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually charged hits like " Tramp, " " Push It, " and " Let 's Talk About Sex " sailed up the charts. On wax Salt " N ' Pepa were demanding their respect. Internally, however, there were problems. Basically, Azor, the group 's manager and producer, wanted to run the show. Granted, he not only created Salt " N ' Pepa, but he also wrote and produced most of their early jams and led them down the path to platinum. In the early days he also told the women what to wear, whom they could associate with and how to act. And free spirit that she is, Sandi simply was n't having it. What complicated matters more was the fact that Azor and Cheryl had become lovers -- which put a strain on Cheryl and Sandi 's friendship. " It felt like a double team, " Sandi recalls. " Since Hurby was her man, Cheryl would be more on his side during arguments than mine. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her man. " Cheryl -- who grew up in Queens with her parents, elder brother and younger sisterbegan having white-picket-fence dreams of raising a family with Hurby. Then their personal relationship got shaky. And by the time he had had a son with another woman, Cheryl 's dreams had flown out the window. In the summer of 1989, Cheryl moved in with Sandi. " We started to have fun again, " recalls Sandi. " I was like, " Girl, you do n't need him. " That 's when we would party. Now we do corny things like bowl and shoot pool and go to the movies and restaurants -- but back then it was a p-a-a-a-r-t-y! " Still every good-bye ai n't gone -- particularly in Cheryl and Azor 's case. Their personal relationship ended, but their business relationship remained. " For a while, it was really hard, " she admits. " We were butting heads and really hating each other. But I found that if I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hinder me and hold me down. We worked well together, and that was beneficial to me. I just learned how to forgive and forget. We 're cool now. " Unfortunately Sandi -- herself a Queens girl from a middle-class nuclear family( she has seven sisters and one brother) -- also imagined a Cosby-colored future for herself that was n't to be. When she became pregnant in 1989, her ex( whom she declines to talk about) was " outta there. " Instead she went to Lamaze classes and delivered her baby with Cheryl 's help. Dee Dee was no luckier in love. Although New Jersey Nets guard Kenny Anderson was in the delivery room when she gave birth to their daughter, Christenese, he, too, was history a few weeks later. One of a family of five sisters and brothers, in retrospect the Brooklyn-born Dee Dee is philosophical about their relationship. " It was my fault, because half a woman will attract half a man, " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-esteem grows, you 'll attract a whole man. " Which is what Sandi, Cheryl and Dee Dee have done. " We try to school women on what type of men are out there, how to be strong and how to deal with them, " Cheryl says. Cheryl met the soft-spoken Gavin Wray, a carpenter, at a club four years ago. Today the couple live together with their 3-year-old daughter, Corin. " He has the basic qualities in a man that, when you 're young, you do n't know how to look for, " she says wryly. " He 's always there for me. He 's stable. He 's a good friend to me and a good father. He spends a lot of time with his child. And he really loves and cares for me. " Sandi met her honey, Treach( from Naughty by Nature), while both groups were doing a gig in Daytona Beach, Florida, three years back. Treach dared Sandi to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows. Sandi, a woman who used to drag-race down the streets of Queens just for kicks, immediately took up his offer. She and Treach have been falling for each other ever since. Onstage Treach is a posturing, somewhat menacing presence. But when he 's hanging with his Sandi, words like courteous and attentive come to mind. At a delicatessen, Treach quickly rises to get Sandi a straw for her soda. Later as Treach and Sandi stroll down the street with their arms wrapped around each other, he stops at a street vendor to buy her two duffel bags. Why? Because when they 'd passed the vendor earlier, Sandi said that she liked them. " He 's the best person that I 've even been with, " she says. And for one of the few times in our conversation, homegirl is totally serious. Dee Dee 's new love is Kermit Holmes, a basketball player with the Oklahoma City Cavalry in the Continental Basketball Association. When they met a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee Dee, it was like fate. " We just clicked spiritually. He 's a " Whatta Man " because he 's Godfearing That 's what I love about him. " Not only have Salt " N " Pepa rehauled their respective relationships, they 've also gone through some business changes. In the late eighties, they 'd bound themselves to contracts that, they claim, were hideously unfair. For instance, Next Plateau Records paid Azor 's production company a reported $5 million in production costs over the years -- of which Salt'N ' Pepa got half, to be divided three ways. Azor got the other half. Since entering into a new distribution deal with London Records U.S. and renegotiating their arrangement with Azor, things are finally looking up. " We had to lose to educate ourselves, but we feel much better now, " says Dee Dee. " Ai n't nobody gon na pull the wool over our eyes no more. " They have also addressed their creative issues. Until Black 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were told in the studio. But as they grew as women, they demanded more control over their musical life. Initially, this, too, met with resistance, particularly from Azor. " He got our image together, and he really felt like he was the father and we were the kids, " explains Sandi. " So when we started growing up and really wanted to do our thing, it was hard for him to let us go. " Although Azor still works closely with them as the group 's executive producer, he no longer controls every little thing they do. The group 's fourth album, Very Necessary, is a testament to how Salt " N ' Pepa have spread their wings creatively. Because the trio thought one of their raps could use some kickin ' background vocals to flesh it out, they took the initiative and called En Vogue. The result was their platinum " Whatta Man. " When Sandi and Cheryl also decided that it was time for a playfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The album 's third single, " Heaven " N Hell, " however -- which speaks to the choices young people can make in their lives -- reveals the group 's more serious, concerned side. Motherhood will do that to you. In fact, all three say that becoming a mother has rocked their worlds, in a positive sense. It certainly shocked their bodies. During their pregnancies, Sandi, Dee Dee and Cheryl put on 40, 25 and 5 pounds, respectively. To lose weight they all started watching their food intake and exercising religiously. Sandi has a do-it-yourself regimen : She stretches her calves using stacks of Yellow Pages and hoists a broom to tighten her arms. Dee Dee does crunches and is a Reebok step-aholic. And Cheryl, who can do 500 crunches at a time, is the most strident : She walks in the morning, runs on a treadmill and has her own weight room in her home. Thanks to the response their female fans have had to their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepa exercise video is in the works for Christmas release. Motherhood, though, is something they take more seriously than their crunches. " She filled something in me that I did n't have before, " explains Dee Dee of daughter Christenese. " I think all three of us feel that way. We were so young -- partying, shaking our thing and " pushing it " all the time. But when you have a beautiful, precious baby, a new responsibility, you start to see things in a different light. " And sometimes that light comes from above. " Everything we 've been through, I guess, finally made us turn to the Lord, " Cheryl says. " We 're not perfect, and we 're not gon na wake up one morning and be totally different people, but gradually we 're learning and we 're growing spiritually. I 've never had so much peace in my life. " Dee Dee adds, " We get together as much as we can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it at night, we do it before meetings, we do it whenever we feel the urge. " Reintroduced to the faith a few years back by their hairdresser and confidante Elena George, the trio also go to church when they can on Sundays. All right, cynics, here we go : How can someone who writhes and wriggles and " Shoops " it up Monday through Saturday be taken seriously when she puts on her church clothes and hums " Rock of Ages " on a Sunday? Answer : Do n't worry about it. " People say you ca n't be a rapper and have God in your life, " says Sandi. " Why ca n't I be who I am and love my God too? " Cheryl agrees. " When I go to church, sometimes I think people are going, " I see her on videos in her little tight clothes and now she 's in church praisin ' the Lord! " she explains. " But if you let that keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where you want to be. And I ca n't let those people and what they say keep me away from my God. " Why not? Because life for Salt " N ' Pepa is all about growth, forward motion, change. Not about ties that bind, but ties that bond. It 's about learning from their mistakes and living life on their own terms. It 's about friendship. " We 've learned how to deal with each other, and we respect each other, " says Cheryl. " But what kept us together all this time, I think, is that we really love each other. " Whatta group! Joy Duckett Cain is the parenting editor of this magazine. <p>
