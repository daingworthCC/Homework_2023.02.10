2010441 ow-gasmic experience Recently, my boyfriend has started biting me a lot during sex. It began with a little nipping and nibbling, but now he 's actually leaving teeth marks. I 've told him that it hurts, but every now and then, he slips and does it again. How did my sweet, gentle boyfriend turn into a vampire? Ouch! Nipping and nibbling are a long-estabfished part of sexual excitement, but when foreplay turns into bloodlust, that 's going too far. Chances are, your boyfriend is not doing it deliberately to hurt you ; he 's in the throes of excitement, and he 's biting you in the mindless way an orgasmic woman might run her nails down her lover 's back without even realizing she is doing it. I do n't think you need to worry that he is a sadist or vampire, as you say he slips up only once in a while. You could even interpret his nibbling as a sign of his affection. How often do we say to someone we think is adorable " I could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Before lovemaking, give him a hard candy to suck on or gum to chew. Or keep something sweet on your bedside table, and when the biting gets overwhelming, pop a ripe peach or chocolate bar into his mouth to keep it occupied. Do it in a lighthearted way and your midsex snack could become a sexy little secret between you. Of course, if you continue to be the snack, it may be time to say au revoir to your vampire. narcissistic nooky My guy has mirrors all over his bedroom, which is cool. But recently, I realized that whenever we have sex, he 's staring at himself, not us. On top of that, he 's constantly asking me to talk about how hot his body is. Is he in love with himself? No, he is not in love with himself. On the contrary, those who need constant admiration and reassurance are actually insecure about who they are and how they are perceived. When a man spends an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up his body, there 's a good chance he is overcompensating in one area to make up for what he fears are deficiencies in another. He may focus on his looks because he feels inadequate about his career, his social life, or his financial situation. If your boyfriend 's physical self-obsession is restricted to the bedroom, it suggests that his basic insecurity probably has to do with sexual performance. You need to remind him that sex is not all about performance-is often just about being intimate with your partner. To show him how fun it can be and wean him off his own reflection, why not playfully suggest a blindfold? Grab a few props-feathers, ice cubes, a sponge, and essential oils-and ask him to guess what you are touching him with and what you are going to do next. Make love occasionally in the open air or anywhere else that is far from mirrors. Be sure he knows that you find him to be a real turn on, not for how he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were virgins when we got together. Recently, he 's been begging me to try new things. At first, I was n't comfortable, but we 've started to experiment and it feels great.When we finish though, I end up shaking and crying uncontrollably. Why Is this happening? There are two possible explanations. The first is that, being inexperienced, you feel guilty about finding so much pleasure in what, until recently, was forbidden behavior in the bedroom. You may cry like a baby because you know that what you are doing would shock and upset your parents if they were to catch you. First, you need to understand that sexual intimacy with a caring partner, however adventurous or dirty it may seem, is an expression of love, not just lust, and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Time and more expert ence will ease your guilt. You can help the head ing process along by talking to your boyfriend and sharing your concerns with him. If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you end up shaking and crying is because the sex is so powerful and pleasurable that you have a strong emotional reaction. A number of men and women can not stop themselves from crying and trembling all over after they have had a huge orgasm. Imagine an intense sexual experience as a gradual climb to the peak of a high mountain, the view extending and becoming more awesome at every step. Then, when you reach the top, down you fly in one huge, thrilling rush! Thats enough to leave anyone shaken, is n't it? And its enough to leave some people in tears too. material girl I come from a wealthy family, so I 've always had really nice things. Recently though, my family lost all of its money, and now we 're broke. Still, I 've been too embarrassed to let on to my friends, so I keep spending money. I have maxed out five credit cards. How can I change? You buy things to make yourself momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into debt, so you shop some more to make yourself momentarily forget your troubles, and you get deeper in debt.. and on and on. This vicious cycle stems from an addiction. You are not obsessed with material things ; you are hooked on the momentary lift it gives you to buy or acquire them. Do n't be so quick to blame your problem on the loss of your family 's fortune ; clearly, you were a shopaholic a long time before things went wrong, but it only began to hurt when you could no longer pay the bills. You and you alone can put an end to this ugly spiral. First, if you do not have a job, join the rest of society and try to get one. If you are not qualified for employment in the career of your choice, then take whatever job you can get while you study in your spare time to earn the proper credentials. Second, talk to an adviser at your bank about how to manage your account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may also want to invest in a good financial book, like Suze Orman 's The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom. Then invite your best friends over for a cutting-up celebration : Let them toast you while you cut your credit cards into tiny pieces and throw them away. Do n't be ashamed! The very idea that you 're embarrassed to be honest with your friends about your situation shows that you suffer from a very low opinion of yourself and, incidentally, of them. True friends do n't care about what you wear-they care about who you are. Finally, I urge you to find another pastime to replace shopping in your life. Perhaps you can start volunteering with troubled children or help collect for a third-world relief fund and see what big trouble really looks like. If there 's any time left, pursue whatever artistic or spiritual pleasures appeal to you. Walk in the park. Go to outdoor concerts. Visit museums. Learn the names of the constellations. If its free, do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge, and a broader view of the world. bust-loving beau Although he 's never said anything, I think my boyfriend is obsessed with abnormally large breasts. I always catch him staring at women 's chests. Mine happen to be pretty small, so I 'm starting to feel inadequate. Would he rather be with a bust woman? Obviously, your boyfriend cares about you, because he chooses to be with you instead of a busty Barbie-doll type, does n't he? However, courteous men do n't check out girls when they are out with a woman they care about. It sounds like this guy needs a few lessons in etiquette. Tell him outright that when he ogles other women, it makes you feel bad. Even if he ca n't help himself, he 'll at least try to be more discreet about it. As for your feeling " inadequate, " you must realize that big boobs do n't do anything that small ones ca n't do as well or better. Sexually, small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive ; they can nourish offspring just as well ; and when it comes to attracting admiring looks, women with small breasts can wear sleek clothes that do n't suit big busts. So ignore your beau and walk just as tall and proud as any busty woman does. panic room I 've been with this guy for eight months, but recently, he 's been having anxiety attacks. He says he 's panicking because he thinks we spend too much time together and he feels suffocated. He told me he needs a couple of days a week to himself. Does he want to break up? As often as we women complain about men never telling us how they feel, just as often, we do n't hear them when they do. Why not? Because they are telling us something we would rather not know. Your boyfriend is saying that he feels suffocated. Of course, it is a hard message to receive, but he 's being honest. He is not telling you he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit in order to be absolutely certain about the relationship before you both get in any deeper. Do him the service of taking him at his word, and cool it. He may have a point. It sounds as if things became hot and heavy too soon. Please, try not to be hurt or angry with him. Use this period of semi separation to let things settle in your own mind and to find out more about your needs and desires. See friends and do different things two or three nights a week, and if you have vacalion time, go away for a bit. Make some changes in your routine and maybe your appearance too. Play a little hard to get. Let him call you, and do n't always be available when he wants to see you either. I wish I could tell you that after a cooling-down period, you two will know that you want to be together for a lifetime. Maybe you will. But if you do n't, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really need so that someday, you can find someone else who is ready for the kind of commitment in which neither person feels suffocated. same-sex suspicion Ally boyfriend 's best friend is a really goodlooking gay guy. They are always doing stuff together, including going out to gay bars, and sometimes my boyfriend even crashes at his place if he 's too drunk to drive. I 'm starting to wonder if they are having an affair. What should I do? It is great when a straight guy is comfortable with a gay friend 's sexuality. But it sounds as though your boyfriend and his gay friend are a little too close for comfort. I am not suggesting that your boyfriend is gay or bisexual or that he is using you as a " beard " to hide behind until he feels ready to come out. But even if you two have a frisky sex life, you do have reason to wonder. After all, gay clubs exist for just one reason, and a supposedly straight guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of male attention. Also, when your boyfriend is drunk and stays over at his friend 's place, I assume his friend is probably drunk too. In other words, they are two men with zero inhibitions. But in the end, all of this is speculation, and you need more information before you make any judgments. Invite yourself along the next time they go out together. Watch their communication and body language. Get to know the other guy too. He is your boyfriend 's best friend, after all. Ask him out for a coffee and find out more about him. Aside from being good-looking and gay, what are his interests? What does he have in common with your boyfriend? Do you like him? Do you trust him? Of course, if doubts persist, you will have to look your boyfriend in the eye and ask him calmly and coolly if there is anything more than friendship between him and his best friend. Maybe he will laugh ; maybe he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either assuage your fears or fess up. And if you think he 's fibbing, then you must break it off. If you do n't trust him now, you never will. klepto conundrum About a year ago, I stole a lipstick from my friend. Since that time, I 've stolen bigger things, and I ca n't seem to stop. Recently, my friend found her grandmother 's ring, which I stole, at my place, and now she wo n't speak to me. How do I get her to forgive me and stop myself from stealing again? It sounds as if you suffer from a condition called kleptomania-a compulsion to steal things you neither need nor even want. In the broadest terms, kleptomania affects mostly women, often those who on some level feel deprived, not of material things but of recognition, love, or security. Because your stealing does n't seem to be out of need or greed, its source is probably emotional. You can stop yourself, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend a counselor or therapist who can help you find out what it is you feel your life is missing that others seem to have : not a lipstick, not Grannys ring, but something deeper and closer to your heart. Do it now. Then write to your friend and explain that the episode with her grandmother 's ring made you realize that you have a serious problem, and tell her you are seeking treatment for it. Ask her to please forgive you for causing her unhappiness. When she realizes the true nature of your problem and knows you are on the road to curing it, I hope and believe that she will understand and gradually renew your friendship.
