2019241 <p> Finding beauty in even the most banal objects, Diana Kurz fashions decorative still lifes and flower paintings. She emphasizes her works ' two-dimensionality by using bright colors and patterns. <p> Diana Kurz first started painting flowers when she was living in Paris in 1985. " I was a transient, " explains the artist, whose luminous oil paintings are infused with sensual, glowing colors. " My studio apartment was small and bare, but I did n't really want to buy anything too large or permanent with which to furnish it. So when I found this wonderful shop nearby where I could buy fresh-cut flowers, I decided to buy some and use them in my paintings. <p> " At one time, I had n't wanted to paint flowers because they changed so quickly, " she continues, " but in Paris, they were so readily available that I could n't resist using them. I realized I could capture the moment of a flower 's life and make it endure. " Kurz says that her intention in painting the flowers was " to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting. " She adds, " I also wanted to make the rest of the picture as full of life and the potential for change as the flowers themselves. In a way, the paintings are memorials for flowers that have been cut down before the end of their natural lives. " <p> Kurz immortalized the flowers by placing them in an environment in which the foregrounds and backgrounds took on equal significance. Favoring rich color and pattern over the conventional illusion of three-dimensional space, her still lifes seem to express French painter Maurice Denis 's statement that " a picture -- before being a war-horse, a female nude, or some anecdote -- is essentially a flat surface covered with colors in a particular order. " Brightly colored blossoms are placed in front of flowered fabrics, patterned backdrops, and other paintings, prints, or postcards. In particular, many of Kurz 's pictures incorporate reproductions of paintings that have influenced her -- images by artists from Giotto to Matisse. In Lilies and Carnations for example, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of one of her favorite paintings, a still life by fifteenth-century master Hugo van der Goes. <p> " I want the viewer to question what is in front, " she says, describing her intentions to completely integrate the subject and its setting. In Porcelain Figures and Tulips, for example, a pale blue and brown flowered vase holding pale tulips has been placed against a deep blue cloth covered with a pattern of pink blossoms. The tulips merge with the flowers on the fabric behind them, creating an illusion of flatness in the painting. The figurines and vase sit on a flowered, light-yellow tablecloth, furthering the sense of two-dimensionality by extending the " bouquet " in all directions. <p> Kurz 's figure paintings support this two-dimensionality as well. In Double Francesca, for example, the artist plays with the shallow space within the picture by juxtaposing the figure of a lithe blond woman with a painting of the same model reclining. Kurz says that the painting is intended to represent two aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model and felt she had a complex, multifaceted personality, which I wanted to portray in the painting. " <p> Juxtapositions of both style and content add another level of meaning to Kurz 's work. She combines not only patterns with assurance, but styles as well. " I 'm interested in mixing cultures in my paintings, " she states, pointing out that in Flowers and Sukeroku, she included a well-known Kabuki figure behind chrysanthemums, a symbol of the Japanese emperor, which she combined with lilies and gladiolus, flowers that are typically associated with Western art, Sukeroku, seen on a fabric print behind the vase of flowers, seems poised in action, denying the image 's flatness. Contrasts between the scale of objects also play an important role. In this painting, for example, the head of the figure is only as large as the head of a flower. In addition, all of the objects are life-size or larger, not only in this painting but in nearly all her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast in painting as being similar to musical counterpoint. Her love of contrast is evinced in her placement of the elegant flowers in awkward ceramic vases or clumsy pots. " I used these vessels because of their lack of conventional beauty and elegance, " she explains. " They are meant to contradict people 's notions of fine-art objects. " <p> The intensity of color in a typical Kurz painting -- expressed in vibrant pinks, greens, and blues that recall the radiant colors of the Fauves -- contributes to the life of the work and also creates an equal emphasis on the painting 's surface. Therefore, there is no fixed center of interest in the painting ; the viewer 's eye travels all over the picture. In Lilies and Carnations, the equally vivid purples of the walls and blues of the table level out the planes in the picture. <p> The surface of Kurz 's paintings is significant not only in terms of composition but in the way she handles the paint itself. One critic, writing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and color. " and added that " Kurz 's brush touches all with an incandescence that is highly seductive. Pinks, soft greens, oranges, reds, and lavenders are part of every area. Her impressionistic way of using paint and color results in surfaces that are fluid and lush. " <p> Says Kurz, " I use oil paint because it has a transparency and luminosity you can not get with other mediums. Oil also allows me to work over a long period of time in many thin layers, which gives a glow to the work. I love the feeling of the paint, its texture. " Last winter, Kurz saw the large exhibition of Titian 's work at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and was very much affected by the show. In particular, she found the luminosity of Titian 's paintings, which he achieved by using layer upon layer of glazes, very moving, and she became inspired to use glazes even more frequently in her own paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence in shaping Kurz 's work was her first sojourn to Paris, on a Fulbright fellowship, in 1965-66( she returned twenty years later, on a studio grant awarded by the American Center in Paris, and stayed in the same apartment she had lived in earlier). There, in 1985, the artist, who is constantly going to museums and studying art books to supplement her own painting ideas, read Matisse 's writings and was influenced by his thoughts on the color black. She explains, " He said that it should be as radiant and luminous as any other color in the painting. " This idea inspired her to paint Lilies and Carnations, which features flowers in a black vase. She says she wanted to make this vase " as volumetric as it would be if it were any other color. " <p> During her first trip to France, Kurz was strongly influenced by the paintings she saw in European museums. The most meaningful were those of Bonnard and Matisse, the latter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine flat patterns with flowered backgrounds. In addition, the visit was particularly significant since it was in Paris that she became friendly with the well-known painter Jean Helion. Helion 's own development from abstraction to representation exerted a strong influence on the young artist, who now credits him with, she says, " being a catalyst for my celebration of the real world. " <p> When she returned to the United States in 1967, Kurz began to teach herself to draw from the model, a skill she never had the opportunity to develop in school since Abstract Expressionism had been stressed to the exclusion of traditional academic drawing. Unbeknownst to her Abstract Expressionist friends, she went to the figure-drawing sessions at the National Academy of Design in New York City. She continued working from the model with a group of older, more-established artists for several years. <p> Process is extremely important to Kurz, who studied with Ralph Mayer, the late painter and art-materials expert, at Columbia University. From him, she proudly relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes I took in his class and I refer to them all the time, " she says. She also feels it was a privilege to have studied anatomy with Robert Beverly Hale. As a result of her training, Kurz has great respect for her materials and takes excellent care of them.( Some of her brushes are more than fifteen years old.) She keeps her supplies very clean and buys the best she can afford-she uses mostly Old Holland paints. She recently discovered Gamblin Artists Colors 's Alkyd Painting Medium No. 1, which, she says, she likes very much because " it dries quickly but has a distinct luminosity. " She favors Robert Simmons and Langnickel brushes ; her chosen surface is either Claussens double-lead-primed linen or Belgian linen that she prepares herself with a traditional rabbitskin-glue and white-lead priming. Kurz strives for freshness above all in her paintings. " I 'm constantly washing my paintings down so they look spontaneous -- as if they have happened quickly even though they take a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change an area, she washes it down with turpentine and repaints it completely. <p> In choosing a setup, the artist works hard to make the arrangement look " unconventional and unposed. " Vegetable Soup, for example, is part of a series of long, horizontal paintings she calls " tablescapes, " which she intends to be viewed more like landscapes than like traditional still lifes. <p> Kurz usually spends as long as several days devising an arrangement for a still life. " I do n't start with a preconceived idea, " she explains. " Usually I do n't know what 's going to work until I see it. I 'm always looking for something that speaks to me. Something may trigger an idea -- a grouping of colors or objects or flowers, or another painting -- but it does n't always work the way I think it will when I get it set up in the studio. Often, the resulting work is nothing like what I think it 's going to be. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time, Kurz finds that a single painting can take up to three years to develop. " It takes a while for me to find a solution to a problem, " she explains. As a rule, Kurz 's paintings come together slowly. She revises a great deal as she works toward complex forms, usually making watercolors, charcoal drawings, and pastels that are conceived as independent works. Most of her drawings take from nine to twelve hours to create. In Still Life With Weller Vase, she says, " I tried to limit myself to just two or three colors ; I wanted to use the pastel as a drawing medium rather than filling everything in. " <p> Knowledge of her subject matter -- whether flowers, figures, or objects -- is derived through these drawings. Kurz carefully evaluates each drawing and then expands the linear compositions into value studies. Once this step has been accomplished, a value drawing is traced several times, creating a contour sketch that serves as a guide to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions in her work. Initially, she painted in an abstract style developed in her graduate study with John Heliker at Columbia University. Eventually, however, she came to feel that the shapes and forms in her paintings were becoming too limited. " I was getting bored, " she says. " I was doing paintings that other people liked, but I felt I was setting up problems I already knew how to solve. It 's always been important to me to work with the unknown, " she continues, " -- with an element of surprise. And I found I was n't being surprised anymore. When I was in school, decoration and pattern were considered minor and unimportant. I never would have dreamed I 'd be making these flower paintings, which go against everything I grew up with as an artist. " <p> Born in Vienna, Austria, Kurz received her B.F.A. degree from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, and her M.F.A. degree from Columbia University in New York City. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museums and galleries. " I am constantly aware of what is happening in the art world and what is fashionable, so my painting representationally is very much an informed choice, " she says. <p> Kurz has exhibited her paintings nationally and internationally, and her artwork is in numerous private and corporate collections. In addition to her Fulbright fellowship, she has received numerous awards and grants, including those from the New York Foundation for the Arts, and has had residencies at New Hampshire 's MacDowell Colony, the Millay Colony for the Arts in Austerlitz, New York, the Vermont Studio Colony and Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York. Last year, her flower paintings were exhibited at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens. She recently had a solo show at the Thomas Center Gallery in Gainesville, Florida. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Left : Porcelain Figures and Tulips, 1988, oil, 48 x 40.
