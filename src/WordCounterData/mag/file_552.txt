4110641 Tuning Your Stance For the best ride, get fitted <p> The Perfect Ride <p> You do n't need outdated marketing hype : You need a bike that fits. Here 's how to find one that 's right for you. <p> By Evelyn Spence <p> Photographed by Michael Robertson <p> Eron Chorney, a mechanical engineer and former racer who spent five years helping Specialized create women 's bikes and products, sounds like she might be setting up a risqu joke when she wryly notes, " It does n't take much scientific study to know that men 's and women 's bodies are different. " <p> There is a punch line, though it turns out to be not so funny for anyone who has bought into -- literally -- the prevailing idea that bike frames and components need to be designed a specific way to fit women. After years of wrestling with the meaning of numerous studies on the physiological variations between women and men, experts such as Chorney are gradually coming to the realization that, when it comes to bikes, the two genders are more alike than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgena Terry created the first modern women-specific model in 1985. These days, more manufacturers are putting aside marketing hype and paying attention to real differences between the sexes, building women 's bikes that are more comfortable and enjoyable. At the same time, though, they 're coming to market with a confusing array of philosophies and products. To choose your perfect bike, you first need to understand why women 's bikes are built as they are. <p> It all starts with the fit <p> The most common justification for women-specific bikes is heard daily in bike shops around the country, dogmatically declared on web forums and sites, and has even appeared in the pages of &shy; BICYCLING : Women have proportionally longer legs and shorter torsos than men, and therefore need shorter top tubes. Too bad it 's inaccurate. Many women may well benefit from a bike with a shorter top tube, but it 's not because the torso dogma is true. <p> " It 's total bunk, " says Heather Henderson, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After Georgena Terry pioneered the women 's bike she went on to start a company that specializes in them. She agrees with Henderson, even though she was inspired to start her business after hearing her female cycling friends complain of neck pain and feeling " all stretched out. " In her &shy; extensive exploration of comparative anatomy, Terry pored over anthropomorphic reports such as a 1955 study from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and even cadaver studies to learn why women would complain of having to reach too far, if their torsos were not &shy; different. She found no objective, legitimate source to support the shorter-torso myth, but did make other discoveries. <p> Terry 's research showed that a woman 's center of mass is higher than a man 's -- at least when she 's on a bike -- so her muscles have to work harder to support her weight than a man 's do. This was a breakthrough. The popular understanding that a woman 's center of gravity is lower, due to proportionally larger hips, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In addition, Terry realized that women in the riding position also differ from men in that they often have smaller arm muscles and less upper-body strength. For Terry, this explained why many women &shy; prefer, or even require, an upright stance, to make cycling easier on their lower backs and arms. <p> Larger companies began paying &shy; serious attention to their women 's products in the late 1990s. Like Terry, product managers at Trek, Specialized, and other big companies culled anatomical data from many sources. Generally, those manufacturers came to conclusions similar to &shy; Terry 's. Henderson, at Trek, theorized that many women tend to roll their hips back to relieve soft-tissue pressure from the saddle, which causes them to arch their backs, and, effectively, need to reach farther to the handlebar. <p> So how did cycling as an industry settle on the shorter-torso &shy; explanation? Probably because it is simple to explain, say the women 's product managers -- but also because the resulting bikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation is rooted in a false philosophy. A bike with a shorter top tube and a more upright riding stance " tends to fit the bulk of the female &shy; population, around 80 percent of them, " said Henderson. The downside : One in five women ca n't get a good fit from a women 's bike, while the &shy; remaining 80 percent may be directed away from other, non-gender-specific models that might be an even better fit for their anatomy and riding style. " We do women a bit of a disservice by pigeonholing them into a certain model, " says Chorney, now with an outdoor apparel company. Instead, consumers should start with a fitting, to get a sense of which type of geometry fits them best -- woman-specific or unisex. <p> The upshot : Do n't set out with the idea of buying a women 's bike. Buy the bike that fits you best. For the best ride, you have to settle on a specific bike, not a philosophy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bicycling magazine proves the value of this approach. One of our occasional female test riders ca n't find stock bikes with short enough reach to provide a comfortable ride ; all of her bikes must be custom made. Two other editors, one female and one male, are built so similarly that they can comfortably share their stock bikes without even a single adjustment. Another editor, a man, was recently told by an expert fitter that his body was proportioned in a way that made a bike with a shorter top tube -- the mythical " women 's fit " -- his best choice. Just as our staff is best suited to different geometries, so are all cyclists, so consider all of your options before making your selection. <p> Look past the paint <p> To get technical, there 's a consensus among product managers that the most important factor in determining an ideal fit is putting a cyclist through a fitting and matching her( or him) to a bike with an ideal relationship between the stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the head tube) and the reach( the horizontal distance from the bottom bracket to the center of the head tube). Bike geometry can be complicated, with numerous tube lengths and angles to consider, but stack and reach are elegantly simple and effective, giving you( or a salesperson) a quick sense of whether or not a bike will come close to fitting you. Not all manufacturers are using these measurements, with some prefering traditional measurements, but any shop should be able to help you determine these dimensions. <p> Once you find the combination of stack height and reach that provides the most comfortable and efficient riding position, it does n't matter whether you 're buying a woman 's bike or not. In fact, some companies acknowledge this. Trek, for instance, sells bikes with upright geometry in both women 's and unisex livery to appeal to anyone who wants a shorter reach and taller head tube, but not necessarily a women 's bike. Other brands, like Cervlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women 's bikes, but have a variety of models with a range of stack and reach measurements to suit most riders. They outfit their women 's models with appropriate stems, seatposts, saddles, handlebars, and even brake levers. <p> None of this means, of course, that you should always avoid women 's bikes. Fit is paramount, but once the measurements are right, if you have a choice between bikes, choose the one that most appeals to you. In a predominantly male-centric market, colors, logos, styling, and even the name of a bike can all reek of testosterone or communicate a male aesthetic. Over time, that can make some women less likely to ride, says one women 's product manager : " Fall in love, because if you do n't love your bike -- whatever kind of bike it is -- you wo n't ride it.

But as I logged more miles, the bike 's quiet strength began to make sense to me, even recalling Muhammad Ali 's famous mantra : " Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. " <p> The SuperSix 's smooth, understated power is the result of Cannondale 's careful rider-focused design. Although the 2012 women 's model shares DNA with the frame ridden to multiple victories last year by Team Liquigas/Cannondale, the company insists that my version is no clone. True to its gender-specific product philosophy, Cannondale 's intention is to offer women " a unique geometry and thoughtful component choices, " says women 's product manager Lyriel Jordan. <p> Indeed, the women 's model has a shorter top tube and slightly taller head tube than the men 's version, and each size has a unique lay-up schedule( the thickness of the carbon fiber, as well as the type of fibers used), she says. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cosmetic adaptations. The frame is then is outfitted for the average woman 's smaller anatomy. Cannondale C2 handlebars are narrower, with a shorter reach and shallower drop, than standard bars, and flare out slightly from the hoods for increased stability. The SRAM Red shifters have adjustable reach, so you can bring them closer to the bar. A lightweight and comfortable Fi'zi:k Arione Donna women 's saddle rounds out the female-specific spec. <p> The result is speed that 's more like Ali 's deceptive stealth than Joe Frazier 's blunt force. Hourglass-shaped seatstays along with the oversized tubing and BB30 integrated bottom bracket provide a seamless blend of stiffness and comfort -- the bike floats forward with every pedal stroke, accelerating so quickly that there were times I found myself suddenly having to soft-pedal to avoid tapping the wheel in front of me. Likewise, it descends and corners confidently with no hint of wiggle, and apart from a slight back-end shimmy when I stood on a near-vertical rise, it 's sure and efficient on long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact crank, a component choice that crit lovers may find limiting, but one that suggests Cannondale believes many women want a versatile bike right out of the box -- and that most of its customers( male or female) wo n't race. But no matter how you choose to ride it, the SuperSix is so smooth you may not realize it 's about to let you throw a knockout punch. -- Leah Flickinger <p> Giant TCR Advanced W <p> One fall day, after missing the group ride, I rolled out solo on one of our area 's most popular routes, a relatively flat, hour-long spin that requires little thought or attention after years of repetition. But I found myself taking the left-hand turn that lead me away from the flats, and toward Spring Drive, a long, curvy ascent -- then adding more climbing on a side street. It was a surprising departure ; I tend to amble along slowly when alone, and rarely choose to tackle extra climbing. <p> Maybe it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's performance line and designed for competition. A lightweight carbon frame, responsive wheels and SRAM 's impressive Force components give you a 15-pound package that proved fast and fun on a variety of rides. If you really want to race, though, the compact crank will have to go. The handling is sensitive and quick, and a sudden sneeze threw me off my line, but the bike 's overall stability let me recover quickly. The bike climbs gamely, though with a steady, regular feel, instead of lots of snap. <p> The TCR W uses the same compact-geometry frame as the men 's version -- the TCR Advanced -- but gets a Fi'zi:k Donna women 's saddle, narrower handlebar, and a shorter stem to reflect the slightly more upright position preferred by some women, as well as our typically smaller hands. With those minimal differences from the men 's version, the " W " designation on this bike is somewhat dubious ; although the Donna saddle is pretty comfortable, the handlebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's often one of the first parts swapped out when women get fit on unisex frames. I 'm 5-foot-8, and most unisex size bikes fit me fine ; if you 'd rather have a built-for-women bike, you 'll want to look for a model with geometry differences or smaller size options. The color is also different from the TCR -- a subtle blue-on-black, instead of the men 's silver and black. I admire that some women really like to " pink " things up, but I 'd rather have a bike that performs ably than a " feminine " color. <p> One of the more notable component specs on the TCR Advanced is the wheelset. Giant is equipping most of its 2012 bikes with tubeless-compatible wheels, making it easier to ditch tubes, if you 'd like. Why switch? You can run lower pressure to improve cornering traction without worrying about pinch flats. Because the tires contain a liquid sealant, tubeless tires are also more resistant to punctures than standard tires. But, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fit tighter in order to seal against the rim. <p> If you 're looking for a women-specific bike that 's completely designed and built for women, the Giant TCR Advanced W wo n't make your shopping list. But if you can achieve a good fit on a unisex bike with swaps to the stem and bar, and you like to ride hard and long, this is a great choice. -- Christine Bucher <p> Giant TCR Advanced W <p> PRICE : $3,700 <p> WEIGHT : 15.75 lb.( M) <p> SIZES : XS, S, M( tested) <p> FRAME : Giant Advanced-Grade composite <p> FORK : Advanced-Grade composite <p> COMPONENT HIGHLIGHTS : SRAM Force drivetrain( 50/34 crankset ; 11-26 cassette) and brakes, PG 1070 cassette GXP press-fit bottom bracket ; Giant P-SLO Wheelsystem wheels, Contact bar, stem ; Fi'zi:k Donna saddle <p> INFO : giant-bicycles.com <p> BUY IT IF : You want to be competitive and comfortable on fast group rides <p> FORGET IT IF : You 're an extreme size, small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry, Felt 's impressive ZW3 is very much a women-specific bicycle. <p> To wit : Although the geometry is virtually identical to that of the unisex, identically-priced Z3, the frame 's carbon lay-up is not -- because female cyclists are typically lighter than men of the same height, engineers use less material in constructing the frame.

Put another way, you get the performance of a bike built for men, in a lighter package. Martin says that most of the cyclists on the Felt-sponsored Exergy TWENTY12 women 's pro team ride the ZW3 frame, with only the taller riders opting instead for the F-series, which has a longer top tube and shorter head tube in most frame sizes. <p> The ZW3 also incorporates female-specific touch points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a slightly shallower drop that 's easier to reach.

The ZW3 is competition-worthy, but it 's a fun bike no matter how you 're going to ride it -- be it on solo rides to the hills or on group rides.
