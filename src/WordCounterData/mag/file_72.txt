2008941 FOUR EASY WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR ODDS AGAINST THE DISEASE BY SUSAN. BARR, PH.D. // Even though heart disease is the primary cause of death for Americans, there 's nothing like the thought of cancer to make the blood run cold. It affects us all : young and old, famous and infamouseven seemingly invincible athletes such as Lance Armstrong. Cancer does n't follow any rules, but science has shown it generally follows a few guidelines. Despite its capricious nature, evidence indicates that about onethird of cancer deaths in the U.S. are related to diet-which puts some control over cancer back into your hands.( Ifyou do n't smoke, what you eat is your biggest modifiable cancer factor.) Of course, changing your diet wo n't guarantee you 'll ride into the sunset cancer-free( genetics are a huge factor). But research indicates that a good diet can stack the deck in your favor. Here 's how. FAT The fat/cancer link is highly controversial. International comparisons suggest it 's important-for example, fat intake is higher in the U.S. than Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. However, studies do n't always find higher cancer rates in those eating more fat. For example, in the Nurses Health Study, the fat intake of over 80,000 nurses was assessed over a number of years, and a lowfat diet did not protect them against breast cancer.( The ongoing Women 's Health Initiative, in which groups of women will maintain diets of either 20% or 30% fat for 12 years, should answer this question definitively, but not until 2009.) What has been confirmed is that too much fat contributes to obesity, and that obesity is linked to certain cancers and heart disease.( It will slow you down on hills, too.) PHYTOESTROGENS These plant hormones include isoflavonoids( found in soy products) and lignans( found in flax seeds). They 've been linked to lower rates of prostate and breast cancer in Asian populations who eat large amounts of soy. Phytoestrogens also inhibit cancer in cell-culture studies. Research is underway on men who have prostate cancer( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soy-supplemented low-fat diets reduce cancer. HETEROCYCLIC AMINES Last year an article in the Journal of the National Cancerlnstitute made the news by reporting that breast cancer risk was 4.62 times greater in women who preferred heavily-browned meat than in those who prefer it rare or medium. The authors speculate that heterocyclic amines, formed during high-temperature cooking, may be the cause. These compounds cause cancer in animal studies and have been linked to human colon cancer. Unfortunately, the authors only asked the women how they liked their meat done but did n't ask them how much they ate, so the results must be interpreted carefully-particularly after considering the known risks of food poisoning from undercooked meats. RESVERATROL This compound, found in red wine, is a potent antioxidant. Antioxidants inhibit oxidative damage to cells, which is thought to contribute to risk of cancer and heart disease. In lab studies, resveratrol inhibits all stages of cancer growth in human cancer cells. And it acts biologically against atherosclerosis( hardening of the arteries). Should we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resveratrol may work when added directly to cells in glass dishes, but whether we absorb useful amounts from wine is open to question. And red wine 's alcohol has been linked to breast cancer. // How to Avoid the Big C Sidebar FAT The Bottom Line Limit fat to no more than 30% of calories and maintain a healthy weight.( One gram of fat equals nine calories-a useful fact for calculating total percentages.) Sidebar PHYTOESTROGENS The Bottom Line Soy products are a good bet for cancer prevention, and may also reduce heart disease risk. So get yourself a vegetarian cookbook and give those tofu recipes a try. Also, buy breads and cereals containing flax seed. Sidebar HETEROCYCLIC AMINES( FORMED DURING HIG-TEMPERATURE COOKING) The Bottom Line When cooking meat( unlike when cycling), safety is found in the middle of the road, so cook meat until it 's no longer red, but avoid turning it black.
