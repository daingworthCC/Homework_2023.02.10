4107341 Love Letters &; Advice <p> The Greatest ' Idol ' <p> THANK YOU FOR YOUR WONderful piece " The Emancipation of Steven Tyler " RS 1130. I was never really a fan of his, but I am now! He 's the main reason people are watching the new American Idol. <p> Kristin Haddox, Santa Clara, CA <p> BRIAN HIATT 'S ARTICLE WAS funny and honest ; it was good to see that Tyler is n't afraid to let the world know about his issues - and that he still has so much hope. <p> Paula Gohl, Glendale Heights, IL <p> CALLING TYLER " AMERIca 's Sweetheart " is like calling James Earl Jones a soft-spoken white girl. He 's ajoke. I lost all respect for him when he decided to be a karaoke judge. He 's Steven Tyler, for God 's sake, not Paula Abdul. <p> David Aubin, Wells, ME <p> I LOVED YOUR ARTICLE ON Tyler. Hiatt did a great job of letting him open up, and then bringing him back into focus. Tyler should be doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanking him for it. The guy needs to work and be creative. Let him be. <p> Ernie Brandano, Boston <p> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT : Steven Tyler has snorted everything except Keith Richards ' dad 's ashes, but he rags on people with weight problems? That 's fucked up. <p> Jim Short, Oklahoma City <p> JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO give up on RS, along comes your deft one-two punch : an insightful piece on Steven Tyler and Nicholas Dawidoff s extraordinary Paul Simon profile. Dude, looks like a subscription renewal. <p> Peter M. Roche, Cleveland <p> American Icon <p> NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF 'S INcredible profile of Paul Simon " Paul Simon 's Restless Journey, " RS 1130 was a serious and superior piece of writing, well worthy of the subject it illuminated. Philip Glass is right : Simon is an American treasure, every bit as much as Bob Dylan - and Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. <p> Michael Baber, Los Angeles <p> EVEN WITH ALL OF THE DEmons Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and figurative, it is the musical legacy that matters most. Thank you, Paul Simon, for opening up and sharing your story. <p> Peter Whalen, Oak Lawn, IL <p> GREAT FEATURE ON SIMON, but as usual, you, Simon and everyone else on the planet, save Art Garfunkel, glossed over the guitar-playing prowess of this great singer-songwriter. Listen to those records from the Seventies - nobody was capturing the beautiful sounds an acoustic guitar can create the way Simon was. It 's hard to overlook the genius of the lyrics and the sound of the voice, but, Christ, how can you miss the guitar? <p> Mike Heisler, Portland, OR <p> Nuclear Threat <p> JEFF GOODELL 'S STORY " The Fire Next Time, " RS 1130 rang a not-so-distant alarm bell, especially since the DavisBesse nuclear power plant is a two-hour drive from me. <p> Jon C. Back, Uniontown, OH <p> MY HUSBAND AND I ARE both engineers at Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station. If I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have bought my house in the Emergency Planning Zone, nor let my children attend school in the EPZ. The claim that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is a " lap dog " could not be further from the truth. If the NRC has a question, you drop everything and provide answers. If you do n't, then you can be fined and go to jail. Goodell should have consulted industry experts instead of relying on sources who have made careers of trying to destroy the nuclear industry. <p> M. Renee Fales <p> West Chesterfield, NH <p> Jeff Goodell responds : Your faith in the NRC is admirable, but the agency 's long history of lax oversight and weak enforcement of safety rules speaks for itself. And it 's not the principled critics I cited in my story who will destroy the nuclear power industry - it 's the high price of building reactors, the failure to find a way to safely dispose of nuclear waste and, above all, the small but very real risk of a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kevin Smith 's Happy Ending " RS 1130, and I admire Smith for looking into his soul and realizing that his passion for filmmaking has died and that he needs to walk away. It 's just a shame he did n't have such insight after he made Dogma. <p> Darren KaKx, Columbus, OH <p> ROCKS CRUCIAL YEAR A new book on the end of the Sixties <p> CONTRIBUTING EDITOR DAVID Browne has always felt that 1970 was an overlooked year in music history. " It felt like a very forgotten cultural moment, but so many things you associate with the 1960s, from the antiwar movement to the space program, came apart at the knees, " he says. " It was a real traumatic time. " His new book - Fire and Rain : The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY, and the Lost Story of 1970 - traces the events of that pivotal year, from Kent State to Dj Vu to Apollo 13 and the breakup of the classic Sixties bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Browne says. " By March of 1971, he 's on the cover of Time magazine. It 's almost like the Sixties ended right on time - the Beatles, CSNY, and Simon and Garfunkel all split up - things just went 180 degrees in the course of one chaotic year.
