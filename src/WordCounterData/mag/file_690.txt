Here, three tips to buy the best : # 1. Look at labels. # Opt for " 100% grass-fed " for beef, bison, and lamb and " pasture-raised " for pork and poultry( which need more than grass to thrive). # 2. Buy online. # Shopping online can net you better prices and more options. US Wellness Meats, for example, sources locally and delivers nationwide. # 3. Shop your backyard. # For budget-friendly meat without shipping fees, contact small farms near you to see who has the most wallet-friendly fare. #
