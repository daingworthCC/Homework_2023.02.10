Or did it leave you in the middle of the desert? Add your own comments at find.pcworld.com/71638. <p> GPS Devices <p> Your article " The Best GPS Devices " in the March issue covered all of their bells and whistles but missed the boat in a most important area : Which one does the best job of guiding you from point A to point S without getting you lost? On a recent trip from the Baltimore area to New Jersey, a route I am famitiar with, I used my Carmn GPS. If I had followed the instructions from the lady inside, I would have ended up in Philadelphia. <p> Marshall Anservitz, Miiiersville, Maryland <p> Intrigued by the number one ranking of the TomTom XXL 550-TM, I went to Amazon.com with the idea of buying that model. I was struck, however, by its onestar and two-star user reviews. For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaws and have me wondering to what extent, if any, PCWorld investigates users ' experience with iterns reviewed. I am certainly happy that I did n't buy this particular GPS unit. <p> - Joseph Chrzanowski, Los Angeles <p> Your review of the TomTom XXL 550-TM coincided with a trip I made to the U.S. Southwest, where I used the device, I liked the accuracy of its arrival-time estimates and, in a part of the country where road signs are far apart, having the speed limit displayed along with rny speed. <p> What I did not like were :( 1) some motel addresses were not in its database ;( 2) it showed country roads as angled turns, not smooth curves ;( 3) even though I had downloaded the latest database, road changes( such as the new bridge over Hoover Dam, which has been open for several months) were not in the database ; and( 4) most disconcerting, when we entered ' City Center ' for Boulder City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert more than 15 miles southwest of the city! <p> David McConnell, Novato, California <p> Editor 's response : All tech assessments reflect certain constraints. PCWorld reviews products before most users have had a chance to report their experiences, and our lab and hands-on testing has to be conducted within brief time frames. Also, GPS devices still have rather notorious limitations- for amusing examples, see the slideshow at find.pcworld.com/71 635. <p> -Melissa J. Perenson <p> Secure Online Banking <p> I read with great interest " Six Tips for Banking Online More Securely " Here 's How, March. Things are different and more secure in Finland. <p> 1 My bank never sends me e-mail. If it wants to contact me, it sends a message to my inbox on the bank 's Website. I can access the message only by using two codes. Alternatively, the bank may send me a snail-mail letter. <p> 2. 1 can not select my password. The bank gives me my customer number, which never changes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity number also given by the bank ; it is used only once. Since these identity numbers are on a sheet of paper, not on the computer, malware can not gain access to them, As the identity number or code is never the same as it was the previous times I logged in, no keylogger can cause problems. <p> 3. 1 need a third number to confirm the paying of a bill, or to confirm that I am sending money to somebody else 's account. This number also changes every time I pay a bill online, <p> Lassi Vakkilainen, Helsinki, Finland <p> Apps vs. Privacy <p> Regarding the online story " New York Times App Tries to Invade My Privacy " by Barbara Krasnoff find.pcworld.com/ 71636 : This antipnvacy behavior, demanding various permissions is actually quite common. The AP app that I have on my Droid X did the same thing when I tried to share a story. Like Ms. Krasnoff, I was a bit taken aback, since all I wanted was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which companies are trying to get themselves hooked into every part of our lives to mine information. Needless to say, I did n't permit it. Even though my Facebook account contains no personally identifiable information or pictures, I do n't allow any apps access to it. <p> CJ100570, PCWorid.com forums <p> This behavior is not particular to the Times ' Chrome app, but is true across the New York Times Website. It is also worth noting that Ms. Krasnoff was able to see what was requested, understand it, and make an informed decision about whether it was worthwhile. <p> If people are truly concerned about privacy, I simpLy advise them in that case not to use Facebook at all. <p> Andre Bebrens <p> Senior Product Engineer, New York Times <p> Tablets- Made for Business? <p> Your online story, " 6 Ways Businesses Are Using Tablets "( find.pcwortd.com/ 71637) was much too surf ace- level. Users can find a world of creative experiments and possibilities for the iPad in personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious paperwork reduction. The iPad will likely change the way we work as much as PCs did in the early eighties. <p> Doug Eirockbank, Vancouver, Washington <p> Digital Disasters <p> Steve Fox 's " Rules to Put Digital Disasters in Perspective " Techlog, March was hilarious because truly good humor contains some Level of truth, and his List is 99 percent true! <p> Charles Son/errare, Byron, Georgia <p> PCWorid welcomes your feedback.
