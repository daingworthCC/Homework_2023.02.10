4140541 As the world changes, we may need to modify our methods of forecasting to better make sense of change. Vet, we must not discard the still-relevant wisdom of the past. The president of the World Future Society lays out some " rules of the road " for forecasting that draw a middle path between inclusiveness and adaptation on one hand, and discretion and convention on the other # Foresight and futures discussions -- whether they take the form of a written article, a conference presentation, or an in-person consultation -- always include a " speaker for the future " and the listener, his or her dialogue partner. Dialogue on futures and foresight is hence an essential search for communication and understanding between parties and viewpoints. The ideal foresight process involves asking and answering questions, as well as exchanging expertise in a working relationship. # The article explores the range of foresight tools and techniques needed to effectively address our changing world. I will offer a few " operational rules of the road " for foresight practice, based on my experience and observation. # Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always useful, even if only to reconfirm validity. But in a dynamic environment, little remains static. Old rules may become out of date # The ability to capture, process, and report data is expanding dynamically, but these are largely quantitative capabilities. Discovering the meaning and gaining insight from data trends continue to challenge us. We need to cross the bridge between quantitative and qualitative analysis( aka, creativity) in order to integrate multiple insights and come to a holistic and useful set of conclusions. One of the most intriguing and yet elusive subjects of inquiry in this arena is what are called weak signals, and we will be pursuing that quarry with enthusiasm. # First, let us consider basic methodology. To start, we take a look at the functional aspects of the extremely large data sets that have become so commonplace in global modeling. The size of these sets is driven by the exponential growth of the Internet, global communications, and surveillance technology. There have been huge increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Our ability to crunch massive amounts of the data is also rapidly expanding. But are we paying attention to the expansion of risk, as well? Are there standards that can help us avoid driving our model off the road at excessively high speed? # Some of the models built to interpret this data flood are highly opaque, and a major concern is how many operators of large data models are actually struggling with these rather opaque analytical tools or are inattentive to the risks. One of the most useful risk-reduction tactics is a more complete understanding of the fundamentals of model construction and management. I have relied below on the excellent work of Adam Gordon. # We should always understand the shape of the data relationships involved -- the basic underlying data relations( usually mathematical), such as direct or inverse, at work in the data set. Connected with this is data interaction -- the relations between multiple factors that affect outcomes, such as reinforcing loops( positive or negative feedback), balancing loops( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( mixes of the two). One way to think about tipping points, for example, involves their activation of feedback loops, such as in climate-change dynamics. These points of activation are referred to as thresholds or discontinuities within data relationships where the rules can change( e.g., producing a catastrophe scenario). # Data potholes can also include stale data, such as in social and economic data( which always has a short shelf life). But ongoing and continuous data updates can be expensive, and using smaller data snapshots is a common compromise. Then there is data lag -- a delay in response between a cause and effect that can range from minutes to years( e.g., birth defects triggered by a genetic disease or toxic exposure from decades before), thus complicating the accuracy of any causal analysis. # Finally, there is the challenge of data translation, where cross analysis between domains( e.g., between social and economic data) is complicated by disconnects across language, concepts, or assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an emphasis on the setting and application of analytical tools. This is because many of the more subtle and unexpected elements of error in foresight involve psychological and cultural factors. These factors affect reliability in both quantitative and qualitative sources and include : # * The cost of detailed primary research( which can lead to shortcuts). # * Homogenization of distinct multiple data sources( for similar cost reasons). # * Lack of clear confidence intervals( how clean the data is). # * Mistaking correlation for causation( a common error). # * Confusing desirability and familiarity with probability( even more common). # * Forecaster 's or technophile 's bias, which involves a preference for change when there is none, and for pattern over randomness( a professional risk). # * Political research sponsorship( influencing public opinion, attention, or awareness). # * Over-immersion in the local Zeitgeist -- social values or perceptions can shift over time( while researcher attitudes may not). # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surprising or disturbing statistics) through selection and repetition( e.g., repetitive data misrepresentation). # * Organizational biases( group-think, polarization, demand for consensus) and cultural values( e.g., premium on high risk, especially common in financial sectors). # * Preconceptions : framing ambiguous or complex issues in a skewed fashion( selective perceptions/distortion of information sources). # A shortage of valid strategies for adapting to unforeseen situations can arise from failure to regularly update situation assessments and data analysis after the initial conditions and dynamics have been determined. This can lead to preconceived solutions to problems instead of the construction of smarter assessment tools that solve and re-solve research challenges in real time. # Another foresight shortfall arises from poor assessment design, as indicated by a pragmatic bias favoring manageable strategies versus an analytical design of sufficient breadth. This breadth can require the cross-impact weaving of a substantial range of factors, sectors, and actors in order to fully capture the system as it has been defined. However, depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile wide and an inch deep. Transparency of model design and operation is also vital, especially as the scale of focus expands upward. # Baroque modeling has become far too popular, though it often neglects to match technical virtuosity with real-world relevance. The elegance of analytical tools can become more valued than their accuracy and utility. A famous example is automated predictive stock trading models, popular in the financial sector before the resulting disaster of the last decade. But it is also appropriate to acknowledge exemplary modeling work, such as that done by Donella Meadows. # Rule of the Road : Attempting to " keep it simple " only works in relatively simple settings with manageable variables. A better goal, most of the time, is to strive to understand and monitor your data to the best of your ability. And the ultimate goal is to prioritize, if not to winnow, the critical factors # Of course, the above rule does not reduce the challenge of expanding the synthesis needed across the foresight field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, economics, business strategy, and other relevant sectors together in a meaningful dialogue. This supports the early engagement of those responsible for implementing foresight analyses. It has been said that a primary benefit of the scenario-building process is educating responsible managers about system dynamics through dialogue with a broader range of system players. # The world grows increasingly interconnected. Writing in the September 2011 issue of Scientific American, Carlo Ratti and Anthony Townshend liken the result to " a shifting flock of birds or school of fish, in which individuals respond to subtle social and technological cues from their neighbors about which way to move forward. " # In a recent dialogue that I had about e-government, officials from China 's Jiangsu province expressed enthusiasm over their ability to respond to citizens. They found themselves in a world where the populace can now tackle problems such as energy use, traffic congestion, health care, and education more effectively than centralized dictates. Such capabilities are actually a depiction of the present in locales like Singapore, where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback and criticism across a wide range of public services. # " Smart Cities " like Singapore offer a bellwether for the changes occurring worldwide in urban areas and public systems. As noted in a recent special issue of Scientific American, " The economic model of a city, for example, depends on models of traffic patterns, agricultural yields, demographics, climate and epidemiology, to name a few. " Accordingly, cities like London, Singapore, and Stockholm are using smart tech to address challenges involving traffic congestion, mass transit, water use grids, crime map networks, etc. This urban interaction of cultural and technological forces can be summarized as follows : # * Increasing transparency. Government corruption and covert action becomes more difficult to hide, while individual and corporate wrongdoing should also become increasingly discoverable by the government. The overall costs of law enforcement fall. # * Fading boundaries. Interactivity rises among citizens, businesses, and government, leading to, for example, the growth of citizen government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over who is accountable for missteps. # * Enhanced intelligence. New sensor networks and the rise in global levels of socioeconomic and environmental data may generate new citizen-centric services, but may also create new markets in sensitive data that will need to be managed and regulated. And open and permeable e-systems enable citizen groups to more easily make demands on city government. # Worldwide 4G( 100+ mbps) bandwidth, expected to be the global standard by 2020 ; crowd sourced data repositories, such as epidemiology monitoring and mobile disaster monitoring ; geotagged media in a public-safety context ; and mobile payment systems for crowd sourced services are all part of new social and economic pattern building that decision makers must recognize and prepare for. A rising number of gray and black market structures " off the grid " are emerging around these trends, often supported by phone-based ordinary-language and gesture-interface software that require no special technical training to operate and thus quickly proliferate. # What is interesting here is the growth of dialogic pathways, driven in large part by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem to support the view of futurist as facilitator, rather than as an outside expert providing an objective view and value-free or agenda-free expertise. The assumption here is that dialogue can enhance citizen abilities to prepare for challenges and seize opportunities. But this " listening to the people " has its own liabilities, based on the all-too-common tendency to " hop on bandwagons. " For instance, if a new management perspective is useful when applied in moderation, it will be even more useful when applied with a fire hose. # Rule of the Road : Inclusiveness -- with moderation -- in analytical and dialogic strategies is usually the most productive approach # In a January 2012 article in Fast Company, editor Robert Safian suggests that any sort of foresight in the present " chaotic " environment is a waste : " If you look too far out in the future, you waste your time?. No credible long-term picture emerges.? There is no pattern. " The basic message here is that total ambiguity is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future, where the only constant will be change. # This approach is built upon the 11-year-old " Agile Manifesto, " which requires that analysts and model builders always choose : # * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. # * Working software over comprehensive documentation. # * Responding to change over following a plan. # This has a familiar ring to anyone who tried to follow the soaring and often overflowing rhetoric of the dot-com bubble of the 1990s before the whole thing crashed in flames. When you hear strong assertions that all that preceded today is nonsense, and that all truth lies at an extreme end of the scale, you can bet that a fall is coming, as the pendulum will swing back again. Instead of the all-too-easy path of clearing all the dead wood( and also the potential rivals for resources) away before you, a more promising( albeit challenging) approach is to use your experience and judgment to pragmatically choose those tools, maps, and plans that continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and technology alone. # A more reliable alternative, which produces lasting results, is to give proven and durable tools and techniques an even playing field with novelty. It is not that there are no maps ; it 's just that maps need to be redrawn much more often than was previously believed. # Your best strategy is always to quickly but clearly understand new systems in context, but a focus on constant motion and instant obsolescence alone does not offer any magical window on the future. True dialogue involves bilateral communication, as opposed to the unilateral rhetoric of the revolutionary, zealot, or faddist. New economic trends driven by technology changes do not by any means require that we reject useful and still-valuable lessons already learned. # The Fast Company article describes a pattern that we have seen too often in the past : the Quick and Dirty analysis. Examples include Enron and its all-too-innovative financial instruments, stock-trading programs that quickly escaped the control of their operators, and the contempt for the values of predecessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick departure. To quote the Fast Company article : " Our institutions are out of date ; the long career is dead ; any quest for solid rules is pointless, since we will be constantly rethinking them. " As with any clear, simple, but highly one-sided vision of the world, that is at least half wrong. # The purpose of citing the list of analytical misassumptions earlier in this article was the hope that, once named, they might be somehow avoided. And avoiding these missteps might increase the likelihood that ongoing foresight efforts could help their participants, consumers, and audiences to expand their horizons rather than narrow them. # The ultimate goal here is to more effectively cope with the unexpected by using rapid response mechanisms and to broaden alternatives by challenging present assumptions. We are aided in these goals by the use of increasingly creative but empirically grounded problem-solving techniques. To step beyond the assertion above that all modeling is based on assumptions that are no longer true, it is essential to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What analysis trumps Why analysis). # At the other end of that scale is the scenario process, whose greatest strength is driving leaders and decision makers to challenge their present assumptions and ask questions that they had not previously thought to ask. Scenarios offer an iterative process designed to pull new information into the decision-making process. The ideal is developing a working mind-set for change : quick response, flexible analysis, and innovative questioning, rather than striving to get projections exactly right. # It is challenging, but we must distinguish between predetermined elements and critical uncertainties. As has been said, if foresight seems easy, you are probably doing it wrong! In contrast, simple straight-line projections, no matter how complex, do not involve an understanding of the underlying process, but arise through observation of past behavior only. This gives us just historical analysis or comparison, but no Why! # As forecaster Paul Saffo has often noted, drawing models with too narrow a range of uncertainty increases the likelihood of avoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said that good forecasting is an iterative process, and good forecast consumers are both participants in the process and ongoing critics. Furthermore, breadth of view compensates for the unexpected. Horizon scanning must balance systematized analysis with an allowance for unexpected evolution and growth. # Rule of the Road : The challenge for the future is to identify problems and opportunities sufficiently far in advance to mobilize technology and policy solutions effectively. We have to understand change dynamics and why change occurs, as well as what potential changes we should pay the most attention to # We need to include " soft " or qualitative data from social/economic systems. This includes political behavior, market dynamics, and cultural currents( involving judgmental or intuitive analysis -- pattern recognition), along with quantitative analyses. I believe this is unavoidable, since we are dealing with systems that were shaped, influenced, and managed by human beings -- which is a major reason they are so difficult to quantitatively predict. # The need for non-quantitative measurement tools has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayesian analysis and " fuzzy " logic -- i.e., conditional measures that assess the level of uncertainty in the light of evidence -- thus allowing a hybrid of apparent randomness and degrees of truth. These judgmental approaches can involve questions such as Why, How, and Who ; a better understanding of these elements can contribute significantly to answering the question of Where? -- i.e., in what directions does the future appear to be trending? # This higher level of complexity suggests that both qualitative and quantitative approaches will need to be synthesized and melded in new ways to reach necessary levels of understanding. It has become a clich to say that twenty-first-century education will have to move far beyond the three Rs to essential skills such as : # * Decision speed. # * Mental flexibility. # * Imagination. # * Ability to understand interactive dynamics. # * Ability to test and validate complex assumptions and models. # Each of these elements builds on the one before it, so that validating assumptions and models is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also skills that could be more accurately termed experiential, or learned in the trenches. These include technology management skills, stakeholder management, crafting decision maker buy-in, assessing resources capacity, cost-benefit analysis, and many more. A good foresight analyst should understand both the capabilities and the limitations of management and logistics systems. # Tapping the Power of Weak Signals # The search for weak signals has been driven by past surprising events and by especially galling foresight missteps -- e.g., " How could we have missed that? " and " Why ca n't there be techniques to avoid such embarrassing errors? " When informed hindsight yields small changes that heralded big changes, the hope of being able to catch the leading edge of early warning from that time forward becomes compelling. Often, a premature judgment had been made earlier in the process that this or that element would have a marginal effect on specific threats or opportunities ; thus, it was ignored. # The allure of weak signals is thus driven by tactical and strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We strive to determine which elements to emphasize and which to ignore, and to do so earlier in the analytical process than previously. # Recognizing and utilizing weak signals is not easy. Neither is interpreting them and incorporating the results into a useful decision-making system. The whole process takes time, focus, and resources. A recent issue of Sloan Management Review makes this blunt assessment : " Fewer than 20% of global companies have sufficient capacity to spot, interpret and act on weak signals of forthcoming threats and opportunities # Companies should try to avoid delusional promises of manageable risk. " Analytical bias can arise not only from data skews and design flaws, but also from cultural and psychological sources. # While incorporating weak signals into your own strategic thinking and operational patterns is a practical challenge, you will be more successful if you view weak signals as just another type of raw trend material -- i.e., incomplete and fragmented data that may suggest trends but that need to be supplemented and verified. The challenge is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators. I suggest combining a set of dialogic techniques -- a dialogue not necessarily between forecaster and listener, but among groups of analysts. # One promising technique for spotting problems early is sharing the raw information across a range of knowledgeable colleagues. This is known in some circles as a " distributed intelligence, " and a good example is the set of information-sharing structures that arose across the U.S. intelligence communities after the 9/11 attacks, such as Intellipedia.org. # The more complex that the future becomes, the more minds we need at work scanning the horizon, scouting the opportunities and risks ahead, envisioning inspiring possibilities, deliberating and debating alternative scenarios, and leading the teams that will build better futures. # Another viable approach is developing special-interest groups in areas of concern, thus extending your own organization 's senses and increasing your periphery. These groups have been termed communities of practice and can provide both breadth and depth, if participation is rewarded by the added value of authentic peer sharing. What you are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a range of methods. # One danger with this expanded networking approach, however, is too much success -- overwhelming volumes of response, or infoglut. One effective response is to initiate attention strategies designed to avoid outpacing absorption abilities -- that is, the decline of attention levels and the ability to effectively prioritize information as it is received. Use of multiple perspectives( e.g., values, market, and attitude analysis) and multiple techniques( with triangulation) can also be productive. But the real challenge is effective translation among distinct sets of terminology and concepts. # Basic scenario-building techniques can also be utilized to provide cross-impact assessment. Overlaps among multiple scenarios can seem inefficient, but they verify the presence of weak signals : When significant redundancy among critical factors occurs, this provides a form of quality control. # As discussed earlier, it 's critical to avoid functional blinders, such as assumptions or bias, by using a range of scanning tools in combination, such as using new technology assessment together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be a complicating factor. The pioneering futurists at Royal Dutch Shell focused on the conflict of ideas rather than the conflict between the people who were advocating those ideas. It is always a good practice to avoid being distracted by the internal dynamics/politics of organizational initiatives, thus concentrating on the systemic consequences of change. # In assessing technology adoption -- how quickly a new technology will enter a market or culture -- we can certainly calculate some factors quantitatively, such as the cost of production and its impact on the resulting price point. But other measurements are more qualitative, such as ease of use and popular appeal. Such factors are more easily measured with " soft " tools, such as surveys or customer focus groups. # This is an instance of combining intuition, experience, and objective measurement( quantitative and qualitative) to interpret weak signals, and this might include drivers of trends distinct from rationality( fear, avarice, ideological fervor, etc.). The climate-change debate is one example of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any scanning and assessment system is measured by how much it helps decision making. For foresight to be useful to you, it must be appropriately tailored to your own situation, include the full range of relevant factors, and allow adjustments to ongoing change. # The goal is to allow participants to understand consequences, integrate varied information into a coherent whole, learn from the process, refine techniques, train new foresight analysts, and move forward. # Dialogue should include more understanding and experience than is sometimes evidenced in the foresight marketplace. I have attempted to highlight some of my areas of concern and suggest some strategies, but the topic is a challenging one ; I have only scratched the surface. I leave it to readers to take these observations and apply them to their own experiences. #
