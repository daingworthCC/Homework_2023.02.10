" Brooke Garber Neidich sells her gold rolling bracelets at private trunk shows at the Mark Hotel and through her family 's Chicago store, and she wears them -- four at a time -- daily. Along with other pieces sold privately or among a small circle of friends -- cashmere shawls by Cathryn Collins, bracelets by Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia, Indian tunics by Lisa Fine and Carolina Irving -- they have become the subtlest of status symbols, discernible only to those who have been schooled in their meaning. And they seem likely to stay that way. Neidich recently began showing her wares at Barneys New York -- rolling bracelets not included.
