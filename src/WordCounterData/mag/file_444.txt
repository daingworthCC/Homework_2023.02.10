4073841 Creating a high-speed, hard-wired Home network is easier -- and more affordable -- than you think. PHOTOGRAPH BY J MUCKLE At some point in its history, the humble RJ-45 Ethernet connector got a bad rap. Wi-Fi routers entranced us all with their promise of easy setup and constant connectivity, while wired Ethernet connections required a mystical knowledge closely guarded by corporate IT professionals. Now, we 've got nothing against Wi-Fi -- for devices such as smartphones and laptops that put a premium on portability, it 's the natural solution. But it turns out that nothing beats a hard-wired connection for setup simplicity, reliability and speed. Advanced Wi-Fi gear has a top-end bandwidth of 600 megabits per second( in practice, many Wi-Fi setups operate far more slowly), whereas wired connections can shuttle data around at up to 1000 Mbps, or 1 gigabit per second, consistently -- great for bandwidth-hogging HD video streaming. Plus, wired Ethernet gear requires no passwords, encryption or complex alphanumeric keys to set up -- all the equipment is plug-and-play. Meanwhile, the home network is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have multiple computers as well as a constellation of connected devices such as game systems, network-attached storage drives, printers, security cameras and media players. Some of these have Wi-Fi connectivity, but almost all of them have an RJ-45 Ethernet jack built in. These networked devices are swiftly colonizing every room in the house. Just as phone jacks and coaxial cable connections have evolved to become standard build-in connections during remodeling or new construction, Ethernet is now the new must-have outlet. And contrary to what you might expect, Ethernet is about as simple and inexpensive as wiring gets -- about $200 will cover all the equipment and supplies you need for an entire house. Beneath the Sheath It 's easy to see why people are intimidated by Ethernet cable. Slice open the exterior plastic sheath and eight tiny multicolored wires spill out like a many-headed hydra. And the variety of cable standards is downright inscrutable : CAT 5, CAT 5e, CAT 6, CAT 6a and so on. Category 5, or CAT 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while CAT 5e and CAT 6 can support gigabit equipment known as 1000 Base T. But CAT 6 is necessary to support the less widely used 1000 Base TX gear, while CAT 6a cable supports corporate-level networking gear at speeds up to 10 Gbps. Sounds confusing, but the average homeowner will be fine with CAT 5e( the " e " stands for enhanced), which supports all the most common consumer equipment and can carry signal to a maximum cable distance of 330 feet. If you 're wiring an entire house, you 'll want to buy your cable in bulk. Online retailer Sewell Direct sells a soup-to-nuts kit, including 1000 feet of CAT 5e, a stripping/crimping tool and 100 connectors, for $85. Of course, when you buy bulk cable, you 're going to have to attach the connectors yourself, but there 's no advanced degree required for crimping. Just follow the U.S. standard wiring code( known as T568B). From left to right, align the wires -- orange stripe, solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, solid green, brown stripe, solid brown -- then slide them into the connector( clip side down) and crimp with your crimping tool. Sound too complicated? Here 's a dirty little secret of the Ethernet world : Even if you get the order of the wiring wrong, it does n't matter -- so long as your wiring is consistent on both ends, the signal will go through. Plan Your Route But before you start stringing wire all over your house and potentially tearing up your walls, do a little detective work. Look around the house for pre-existing holes and pathways that will help you route the wire more easily. Draw out a rough blueprint for your house and plot the most efficient routing path for your network -- use your attic, basement and/or crawlspaces to move wire from one room to the next. Think hard about what pieces of equipment need to be networked and where these devices are located, and plan for the future ; young children may eventually need connectivity in their rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen, and, heck, someday you might build that home theater in the basement. I even sent my network into my bathroom. Remember, your network diagram begins with your broadband modem, then progresses to a router, which serves as the traffic manager for your entire network. If you already have a Wi-Fi hotspot in your house, keep in mind that many of these devices do double duty as wired routers, and typically have four RJ-45 ports on the back for wired network connections. Past the router, you can use simple Ethernet switches to split your network into as many branches as you wish. Switches can have anywhere from four to 48 ports, and are far less complex than routers -- setup is as easy as plugging the switch into an electrical outlet, then plugging in all of your Ethernet cords, like an electrical power strip for networking. That said, routers and switches are powered digital devices, so some locations -- basements, attics and closets -- may get too hot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical outlet. As to the specifics of routing signal cable such as CAT 5e or CAT 6, check local building codes, but with low-voltage wiring there generally are n't many restrictions. From my experience, however, it 's a good idea to space any Ethernet wall outlets at least 1 foot from electrical boxes to avoid interference. And when you get around to actually installing your cable, standard wiring procedure applies : Use a stud finder to plan around your framing. If you are installing in an existing wall, use an old-work electrical box or low-voltage bracket and mount a network faceplate to it, then fish the wires through the wall to your outlet using a drop chain or fish tape. If drilling holes, snaking wires, and mounting outlets and boxes throughout the house does n't appeal to you, do what the cable companies do and run the cables through closets and along your baseboards. When you are done, do n't forget to keep a stock of extra cable, connectors and tools, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your needs grow. Plus, once you show your friends and family that there 's no need to fear the RJ-45 connector, they may want to borrow a bit of your mystical IT knowledge -- and all of your extra supplies, of course. DRAW IT OUT Before snipping a single cable, inventory the networkable gearin your home. Create a diagram to determine the most efficient routing path for your wire. Think of wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi as complementary technologies. Portable devices such as laptops and smartphones can tap into the wireless system, while stationary devices that require more robust connections plug directly into the network. Buying cable in bulk saves serious cash. For 1000 feet of cable, expect to pay between $50 and $80.
