2118741 When MATTHEW MARTINEZ( D., Calif.), an affable ex-Marine who represents a swath of suburban Los Angeles, attended the White House luncheon for Mexican President ERNESTO ZEDILLO last November, he had something that President Clinton wanted : a potential vote for the fast-track trade bill. And Clinton had something Martinez wanted : power to approve the $1.4 billion Long Beach freeway extension, blocked by environmentalists and historic preservationists for two decades. When a Clinton lobbyist approached him, Martinez was ready : " Why should I vote for fast track when it 's like pulling teeth to get anything from the President? " Martinez recalls saying. Within days, Martinez got a late-night call from Clinton, and, later, a call from Transportation Secretary RODNEY SLATER, telling him that the project would move forward. Martinez claims " there was never a deal, " but a week after he came out in of the now dormant fast-track bill, the Federal Highway Administration green-lighted the 4.5-mile project. At $311 million a mile, the freeway would slice through historic areas of South Pasadena and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes. Moreover, just as the highway suddenly acquired Clinton 's backing, the Administration was pulling the plug on Los Angeles ' subway funding. -- By Margot Hornblower/Los Angeles
