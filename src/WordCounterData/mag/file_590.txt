4139541 Section : MAHB : EAT LIKE A MAN From gleaming holiday beast to savagely picked-over bone, in six relatively easy steps # When the writer Dorothy Parker defined eternity as " two people and a ham, " she was n't kidding. Once the plate-sized portions are carved out, you 're still left with a mountain of meat( and bone) too good to go to waste. And yet many just walk away. Maybe they 're daunted by all that ham. Maybe they do n't understand the near-infinite possibilities it offers to the bold, the willing. So, as both service and challenge, we devised a step-by-step, dish-by-dish, day-by-day guide to consuming an entire ham. Ideally with other people. But, you know, the world loves a dreamer. # START WITH : THE HAM # SERVES? # TIME 02:45 # INGREDIENTS # &gt; 1 whole ready-to-eat city ham, about 15 to 18 lbs( if refrigerated, let stand at room temperature for 3 hours before cooking.) # &gt; 1 cup apple juice # &gt; cup maple syrup mixed with? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oven and remove the top rack( so you have room to baste). # Preheat oven to 325 degrees. # Score a crosshatch pattern about? -inch deep in the fat. # Lay the ham in a shallow roasting pan, place in oven, and pour 1 cup water into the pan. # Bake for 90 minutes. # Remove the water from the pan, add the apple juice, and pour the syrup-bourbon mixture over the top of the ham. # Bake for another 45 minutes, basting often with the pan liquid.( If your ham is smaller, cook 8 minutes per pound.) You 'll know it 's done when the exterior is a crispy golden brown, the internal temperature hits about 140, and your entire house smells like ham. Let ham rest for 30 minutes before carving. Serves a lot of people for a very long time. # AND THEN : A HAM-EGG-AND-CHEESE : BREAKFAST SANDWICH # SERVES 1 # TIME 00:10 # Melt Tbsp unsalted butter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Add a -inch slice of ham and sear until caramelized, about 2 minutes per side. # Remove ham and place it on the bottom half of a toasted oversized English muffin, leaving the pan on the heat. # Crack the eggs into the pan, cooking them in the residual fat until done sunny-side up, over medium, or however you want. Remove. # Lay a slice of Monterey or pepper-jack cheese on top of the ham, then one egg on top of that, then another slice of cheese, and then the other egg, to melt the cheese. # Top with chipotle salsa, close, and eat over the sink.
