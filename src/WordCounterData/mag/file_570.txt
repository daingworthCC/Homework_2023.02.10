4112441 Does the Obama Administration even understand the Constitution-or the Bill of Rights-when it comes to executive power and the Satn T? 0r <p> PRES. BARACK OBAMA campaigned for office largely on the claim that his predecessor had shredded the Constitution. By the Constitution, he could not have meant the document signed on Sept 17, 1787. Article H of that parchment begins with a simple declaration : ' The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America " Not " some " or " most " or even " all but a teeny-weeny bit " of the executive power. The president is vested with all of iL This particularly is noteworthy when compared with the enumerated legislative powers vested in Congress : " All legislative Powers herein granted. " The Founders understood, based in part on their unfortunate experience under the Articles of Confederation, that the branch of government most likely to be in need of the ability to act quickly and decisively is the executive. The branch most likely to overreach is the legislature. <p> Perhaps, then, candidate Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pres. George W. Bush shredded the Constitution, but leaving that question aside for now, let us consider how Pres. Obama has fared in undoing the Bush policies he opposed He began dramatically in January 2009 by issuing a series of executive orders. According to one, Guantanamo Bay detention camp was to be closed within a year. Even though the rjrincipal planner of Sept 11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, or KSM, had announced that he would plead guilty before a military tribunal at Guantanamo, the Justice Department announced in November 2009 that the military commission was cancelled. Instead, KSM would be brought to the mainland U.S. to stand trial. In response, Congress passed a statute, relying on its **27;16301;TOOLONG power of the purse, directing that no Federal funds be used to bring any detainee from Guantanamo to the U.S. As a result the Guantanamo military commission trial for KSM and other detainees charged in connection witfi Sept 1 1 is back on. <p> Another executive order in January 2009 suspended the CIA interrogation program. Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was announced that anyone acting on behalf of the U.S. government even a highly trained QA operative seeking sensitive security-related information, is limited by the Army Field Manual. This manual - because it was drafted for general use - is pitched to the capabilities of the most junior recruit in the field interrogating someone he has just captured In fact it has been available on the Internet for years and has been used by terrorists as a training manual for resisting interrogation. <p> The abandoned CIA program involves* - in what probably is the most disastrous marketing term since New Coke - " enhanced interrogation " methods which were, in fact completely lawful. When detainees were subjected to them - detainees knowledgeable of Al Qaeda and resistant to lesser techniques - we learned a great deal. Three of them - Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abdel Rahim al Nashiri - gave up a huge trove of valuable information. Not only did KSM disclose general information on how Al Qaeda moved money and people, but specific information that helped disrupt other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif.) Library Tower. It was to be carried out by a South Asian group headed by a man named Hambali. Other information resulted in the capture of people involved in a plan to develop a biological weapons capability in the U.S. The list goes oa <p> Not only has this interrogation program been abandoned when people today are apprehended in connection with terrorist plots directed at this country - and there have been more than 20 since Sept. 11 - most immediately are turned over to law enforcement authorities, informed of their Miranda rights, and treated as routine criminal suspects. <p> What do we lose in this process? With the would-be Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, we lost the chance at information about who had built his explosive device. From those that have shown up in packages originating in Yemen, it appears that the same bomb maker still is in business, and he is believed to be responsible for an explosion that injured Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef, the man largely credited with Saudi Arabia 's counterterrorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains committed to closing it For example, no new detainees are being brought there. We recently learned that a man named Warsame was apprehended and was thought to be in possession of valuable intelligence. He was placed aboard a naval vessel and debriefed for two months, after which he was advised of his Miranda rights and brought to the U.S. The Administration disdains military tribunals, notwithstanding the fact that they have been used in our history from the Revolutionary War to World War II and are provided for specifically Hi a statute passed by Congress caUed the Military Commissions Act <p> The Administration also remains committed to figuring out a way to release those detained Hi Guantanamo, despite the fact that at least 20% of Guantanamo alumni have returned to the battlefield. We know that figure because 20% have been recaptured or kled. How many others are stiU Hi the fight is anyone 's guess. <p> So, after aU of this, where do we stand? The intelHgence-gathering techniques adopted and foUowed during the preceding Administration not only remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to a vigorous and courageous exercise of the Article? Commander-inChief power, and the splendid performance of a team of Navy Seals, Osama bin Laden is dead. I certainly would not minimize that achievement He needed killing, and he and we needed it to be accompHshed at the hands of Americans. It was done in a way that allowed us to exploit the trove of inteUigence that was found in his home - though one wishes that less had been said about it at the time, rendering it more effective. <p> His death has great symbolic significance, because of the status he had attained during the 10 years since Sept 11, but it is impossible to gauge the significance of bin Laden 's death unless - and until - we recognize the simple fact that our encounter with what he stood for began much earUer than Sept 1 1, 2001. <p> What bin Laden stood for was Islamism, whicli - insofar as it holds the U.S. in a weird combination of awe and contempt - has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two " isms " that we successfuUy conquered Hi the last century. As a movement distinct from the religion of Islam itself, Islamism traces back to Egypt Hi the 1920s, when the loosely organized Muslim Brotherhood was estabUshed by a man named Hassan al-Banna, who founded the MusUm Brothemood as a reaction to the modernizing influence of Kemal Ataturk - the latter dismantled the sheU of what was left of the Muslim caliphate in Turkey, banned the fez and headscarves, and dragged his country Hito the 20th century. <p>?? -Banna 's principal disciple also was an educator - a bureaucrat in the education department of the Egyptian government named Sayyid Qutb, who caused enough trouble Hi Egypt to get himself awarded a traveling feUowship Hi 1948, the year al-Banna was kled. Regrettably for us, Qutb chose to travel to Greeley, Colo., and, although it would be hard to imagine a more inoffensive place than post-World War? Greeley, for a man like Qutb it was Sodom and Gomorrah. He hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, jazz, and what he caUed the " animal-like mixing of the sexes, " even Hi church. His conclusion was that Americans were " numb to faith in art, faith in reUgion, and faith Hi spiritual values altogether, " and that Muslims must regard " the white man, whether European or American as our first enemy. " <p> Qutb later returned to Egypt, quit the civ service, and joined the Muslim Brotherhood. He welcomed Gamal Abdel Nasser 's coup against the corrupt monarchy of King Farouk in 1952, but then became dislusioned with Nasser for failing to institute Sharia law. He opposed Nasser, and was subsequently arrested and tortured. However, he continued to write and agitate for Islam and against Western civilization, particularly against Jews, whom he blamed for atheistic materiaHsm and considered the worst enemies of Muslims. He was released for a time, but eventually was re-arrested, convicted of conspHacy against the government and hanged in 1 966. <p> Many members of the Brotherhood fled to Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qutb 's brother was among those who left and taught the doctrine in Saudi Arabia Among his students were Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian who would become a leading Al Qaeda ideologist, and a then-obscure Osama bin Laden, the pampered chd of one of the richest construction famies in the country. The rest as they say, is history. <p> That history did not come to these shores on Sept 1 1, 2001- or even on Feb. 26, 1993, when a duck bomb detonated in the basement of the World Trade Center, killing six and wounding hundreds. It came - at the latest - in the 1980s, when a couple of FBI agents spotted a group of men taking what looked like particularly aggressive target practice in Calverton, N. Y, ironicaUy enough, the Long Island town in which a veterans ' National Cemetery is located. When they approached, they were accused of what we now caU racial profiling, and they backed off. <p> In November 1990, one of those men, ElSayyid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in the balHoom of a Manhattan hotel. When the 1993 World Trade Center bombers demanded the treeing of Nosair from jail, it became apparent that the Kahane assassination had not been the lone act of a lone gunman. Authorities reviewed the amateur video of Kahane 's speech the night he was killed and discovered that one of those 1993 bombers had been in the hall when Kahane was shot Further investigation disclosed that another was driving the intended getaway vehicle. <p> The man who served as the spiritual advisor to Nosair and the 1993 World Trade Center bombers, Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called blind sheikh, along with Nosair and several others, were tried before me and convicted for participating in a conspiracy to conduct a war of urban terror against this country - a war that included the Kahane murder, the first World Trade Center bombing, and a plot to blow up other landmarks around New York and assassinate Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak when he visited the United Nations. The list of unindicted cooenspirators in that case included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was treated as a series of crimes - unconventional crimes, to be sure, but crimes nevertheless. This despite the fact that in 1996, and again in 1998, bin Laden declared that he and his cohorts were at war with the United States. <p> In 1998, the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were bombed almost simultaneously. Again the criminal law was invoked, this time in an indictment that named bin Laden as a defendant Apparently, he was unimpressed or at least undeterred, because in 2000, Al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, killing 1 7 sailors. It would have carried out the bombing of another naval vessel but for the fact that the barge carrying the explosives was overloaded and sank. <p> Then came Sept 11, and to the call " bring them to justice " was added the call " bring justice to them. " We were told that we were at war more than 50 years after Sayyid Qutb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, about 15 years after Islamists had made it clear that they were training for war with us, and five years after bin Laden made it officiai with a declaration of war. <p> In fighting Islamism, we are handicapped at the strategic level by the refusal of those in authority to acknowledge the goals of our adversaries. Those goals essentially are political, and involve the re-creation of an Islamic caliphate and the imposition of Sharia law over as broad a swath of the world as possible. This is a profoundly antidemocratic movement at its core, and it regards the whole idea of man-made law as anathema Instead we try to be inoffensive by using a term that originated in the Administration in which I served and we refer to a war on terror or terrorism. People who wish to quibble about what it is we are at war with take the discussion off into absurdity. One such person is John Brennan, Pres. Obama 's assistant for National Security, who, before an audience at the Center for Strategic Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on terror, saying it is impossible to have a war on a means or a state of mind. <p> This lack of clarity also distorts the view of policymakers about what is happening in the Middle East and so they daydream about democratic movements when the reality on the ground is more populist than democratic. The principal beneficiary of populism is more likely to be the Muslim Brotheihood than the local spokesman for Facebook. The credo of the Muslim Brotherhood is succinct and chilling : Allah is our goal ; the Prophet Muhammad is our leader ; the Qu ' ran is our constitution ; jihad is our way ; and death in the way of Allah is our promised end. <p> If the death of Osama bin Laden is more than simply a spasm, or an opportunity to engage in self-congratulation - if it helps provide some insight into the nature of what it is we are fighting - then it will have been significant indeed If not its significance substantially will be diminished. <p> The signs do not seem promising. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was pointed out by Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution - there was no discussion whatsoever of the 19 people who perpetrated the atrocity. Ajami pointed in particular to Ziad Jarran, the most Westernized of the hijackers. <p> Raised in Beirut, Lebanon, to be cosmopolitan in the spirit of that city, he went to Hamburg, Germany, where he was radicalized, and then wound up at the controls of Flight 93, the one that was supposed to hit the U.S. Capitol. It did not because the passengers learned what had already happened at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, figured out what was in store for them and their country, and chose to act <p> The importance of intelligence <p> There is much to be learned from those facts. Start with the last We learn the importance of intelligence. The passengers on Flight 93 were able to act because of what they had found out about what was going on elsewhere. Intelligence gathering must be our number-one priority. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement that does not occupy any particular place or country that we can demolish and then pronounce ourselves the winners. They live, in some cases, among us, and the only way of opposing them successfully is to find out in advance what they intend to do and to thwart it <p> Second note that Jarrah was radicalized not in the Middle East but in the West We must be aware of those in our society who wish to create closed ethnic zones, where Muslims essentially run their own affairs and outsiders enter only at their peril. This already has happened in the suburbs of French cities, in parts of England and in other places you would not expect it such as Malmo, Sweden, and it allows radicazation to go on undetected. Guidelines have been put in place to permit the FBI to function for the first time in its history as an intelligence gathering organization and not simply as a law enforcement agency. If the Bureau partners with state and local law enforcement then the kind of insular activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Those guidelines must remain in place and must be defended. <p> Doing that will require an intelligent understanding of the part of the Constitution I did not discuss at the outset the part that animated so much criticism of the Bush Administration by those now in charge - the Bill of Rights. This part of the Constitution provides robust protection to public and private activity that we value, which is essential for the continuation of our civic life, but it does not require that we close our eyes when there are people plainly setting the stage for activity that is in no way protected. <p> The First Amendment protects tree speech and freedom of worship. It permits preaching even violence in the name of religion, but it does not guarantee that such speech will go undetected - nor does it guarantee that evidence of it can not be presented in a court when, and if, it is appropriate to charge that the speaker and those to whom he spoke understood this protected speech and took it as a call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speech - such as an agreement to commit a crime, which constitutes the crime of conspiracy. <p> The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and contains a separate warrant clause providing that warrants may issue only on a finding of probable cause. <p> That does not mean that a search conducted for intelligence purposes requires a warrant, only that it be reasonable. <p> The Fifth and Sixth Amendments guarantee due process, counsel to those accused of crimes, and &; right to confront witnesses, but their application is limited to trials ooeurring in Article Hl courts. How much process is due and what kind of evidence may be received and under what circumstances in other tribunals, such as military commissions, is an entirely different story. <p> The message lurking in the structure of the Constitution is that those acting lawfully under it deserve at least the benefit of the doubt when they act to protect the common good. That is not meant to be a statement or a suggestion of a jurisprudential standard, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudential standard, a standard of civics and public discourse. This standard will help keep intact the system that we depend on to preserve the nation that Pres. Abraham Lincoln called the last best hope of Earth - words that are truer today than they were when he spoke them during another time of trouble. * AuthorAffiliation <p> Michael Mukasey served as U.S. Attorney General from 2007-09, U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York from 1988-2006, and assistant U.S. attorney for that same district from 1972-76.
