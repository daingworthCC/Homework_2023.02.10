5005541 <h> Singaporeans take pride in keeping the city clean -- and more than half will tell those around them not to litter, survey finds <p> Singaporeans are proud of their clean and green city and most, if not all, take pride in keeping things that way, a survey has found. <p> Conducted by the Singapore Management University( SMU), 97.2 per cent of respondents in the second Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey( PCSS) said they took pride in keeping Singapore clean. <p> Released on Thursday( May 16), the PCSS collected responses from over 2,000 Singapore residences over a period of six months from August to December 2018. <p> The study -- led by Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, professor of sociology( practice) at SMU, and Dr Mathew Mathews, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore 's Institute of Policy Studies -- found that 94.4 per cent of respondents strongly agreed with the statement " Singapore is a clean city ". <p> A significant number of respondents( 96.3 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed that visitors who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, many respondents felt that they were n't alone in being proud of Singapore 's clean identity. <p> In total, 88.7 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that other Singaporeans, like themselves, also took pride in keeping the city clean. <p> However, 87.4 per cent of respondents believed that Singapore was clean only because of its efficient cleaning services. <p> Singapore Management University <p> Despite that, the survey also found that more respondents are adopting " pro-social behaviours " related to public cleanliness. This includes reminding a family member not to litter, holding their trash until they find a bin, and returning their utensils at hawker centers. <p> Slightly more than half of respondents( 54.3 per cent) said that they would remind a family member not to litter if they noticed them doing so, up from 45.7 per cent who said the same in 2017. <p> More people are also cleaning up after themselves at hawker centers, with 48.7 per cent of respondents saying that they clear their utensils after eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The findings of the survey also showed that nearly 72 per cent of respondents would hold on to litter until they are able to find a bin most of the time. <p> Fewer people are also disposing of their rubbish inappropriately. <p> Compared to 55.3 per cent of respondents in 2017 who said that they had never disposed of rubbish inappropriately, 62 per cent said the same in 2018. <p> Singapore Management University <p> While more people are adopting pro-social behaviours, the study also noted that there remains a " sizeable " portion of residents who have yet to familiarise themselves with pro-social public cleanliness behaviours. <p> " We suggest greater efforts in public education efforts to encourage such pro-social behaviour especially in reminding others, including those who are visitors to Singapore, about established cleanliness norms here, " SMU said.
