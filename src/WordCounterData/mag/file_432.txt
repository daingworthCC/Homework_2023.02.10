4070241 When autumn leaves change color and the first frosts hit, it 's time to think woodcock. Timberdoodles provide great shooting when their migration is on and the flight is " in. " But therein lies the trick : trying to predict when birds will arrive, then knowing where to find them. These timberdoodle tips will help you feel the satisfying weight of a brace of woodcock in your game bag. <p> L : NOTE TRADITION Woodcock traditionally move southward through different latitudes at around certain dates( see map below). These times coincide with peak leaf color and frosty nights, but are generally ahead of deep freezes that lock up the woodcock 's food supply of earthworms, which the long-billed birds probe for in soft soil. Decreasing day length triggers migration. Weather events and lunar patterns also affect migration, so it 's essential to consider those factors too. <p> L : BE A WEATHER WATCHER As the traditional migration period for your area nears, it 's time to watch the thermometer. But not your own -- look to the north. For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota, so I study the temperatures in northern Minnesota and southern Ontario. When deep freezes happen there( a couple of nights of 28 degrees or below), I watch for woodcock to arrive in my home coverts as they travel ahead of the cold. <p> FLIGHT TIMES : This calendar provides reliable information on when you are likely to see woodcock in your area. <p> L : OBSERVE THE MOON Woodcock fly mostly at night, so the moon may serve as a navigational tool. Data show that autumn woodcock movement increases with a gibbous( more than 50 percent lit) moon. A waxing moon -- one moving toward full -- seems to induce greater woodcock movement than a waning moon. <p> L : TIMING IS EVERYTHING Wind and barometric pressure also affect the migration 's timing. A north or northwest wind brings in woodcock, as the birds ride the flow southward. Rising barometric pressure -- associated with the clear blue skies and strong tailwinds of a departing low-pressure system and an arriving high -- also brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a topographic map. Woodcock concentrate in low, moist spots, the better for hunting earthworms. Look for creeks, brooks, beaver ponds, bogs and marshes, and focus your efforts there. Stream corridors, especially those that run north to south, often serve as migration routes. Look for feeder streams running east or west ; these moist areas provide food and holding cover. <p> L : READ THE COVER Aspen -- particularly young stands with trunks of buggy-whip to pole size -- attract woodcock. The clean forest floor lets timberdoodles hunt for worms, the stem density protects them from land-based predators and the overhead canopy foils would-be avian enemies. Other preferred habitats include alder runs( for their cover density and moist soil) and willows. Research shows that alder runs may hold more birds in dry years, likely because of the associated moisture. Dogwood and sumac can also produce. <p> L : HUNT THE EDGES Woodcock prefer transition zones or edges, and a seam between cover types usually holds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marsh or bog, forest to dogwood, willow to marsh, second-growth timber to brush, forest to wetland zone -- all are worth investigating. Edges of meadows and abandoned fields also attract woodcock. Work the inside edge of the forest or brush, and take a swing back through the field edge, too. Meadows with goldenrod seem to attract woodcock. <p> L : CONTROL YOUR DOG Woodcock do n't walk around much, so they wo n't leave scent trails for your dog. When danger nears, timberdoodles sit tight, relying on camouflage coloration for safety. This, combined with the thickness of good woodcock cover, means that you need to keep your dog close. Be ready for an unexpected flush or a stop-in-his-tracks point from your pointer. Take several swings through good-looking cover. <p> L : HUNT SLOWLY The best hunting approach is slow, methodical and thorough. Pause often, and always have your gun at the ready. <p> L : SHOOT QUICK Conventional wisdom dictates that the ideal time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vertical rise, when he pauses ever so briefly before darting off horizontally. A better plan is to shoot quickly as the woodcock rises-with safety for canine and human companions in mind -- before the bird really gets darting, juking, veering and dodging. <p> By Tom Carpenter <p>
