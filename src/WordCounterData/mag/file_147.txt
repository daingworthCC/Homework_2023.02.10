2018241 It 's an exciting time to be involved in snowboarding, but it 's also terribly confusing. This is one of most innovative and dynamic sports in the world. A tad too innovative and dynamic, perhaps. Equipment designers disagree on just about everything -- board shape, binding mounting methods, soft boots or hard boots, plate bindings or soft bindings -- the list goes on. To snowboarding neophytes, these terms may mean nothing. But to the snowboarding industry, " inserts " and " retention plates " are fightin " words. Part of the problem is youthful enthusiasm. The whole snowboarding industry is only about 12 years old, and sometimes it still seems like a toddler excitedly trying out its newly discovered motor skills and getting a little carried away. Alpine skiing, ski mountaineering, skateboarding, athletic shoes, even silverware -- influences from all these can be seen in equipment design. The result is a dizzying array of technical concepts that can easily intimidate would-be snowboard consumers. You 've heard of personal trainers ; well, you practically need a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene. The days when you could simply walk into a store and ask to buy a snowboard are gone. Now you must choose between an " Alpine " board for carving turns, an all-around " freeriding " model, or a trick-oriented " freestyle " board. Then you have to choose among the various shapes that boards come in. Symmetrical or asymmetrical? Asymmetrical? Okay, which one : the kind where the sidecuts are shifted or the kind where the heelside sidecut is deeper? Or maybe you 'd like this nice symmetrical board with the asymmetrical core? You get the picture. And we have n't begun to discuss boots and bindings. All this raises the inevitable question : Should equipment options be simplified to mitigate the intimidation factor on consumers? In a word, yes. But until then, think of SKIING as your personal tech rep. After giving boards the bulk of their R &D; attention over the past decade, designers are turning their attention to creating boot/binding systems that are more reliable, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background. There are two different types of boot/binding systems. Adapted from Alpine and ski mountaineering boots, stiff plastic hardshell boots are used with plate bindings( the " hard " system) and provide maximum support for racers and Alpine-oriented riders who just like to carve turns. Soft-shell boots are worn with highback bindings( the " soft " system), and because they allow more forward and lateral flex, they 're the choice of most freestyle snowboarders. Their degree of support can vary significantly, depending on how hard the plastic is on the lower portion of the boot. In the past, snowboarders have been faced with a cut-and-dried choice between hard and soft boots. Ironically, a clothing manufacturer -- Ocean Pacific -- has taken the most aggressive step in bridging the gap between the two. Designed with the input of freeriding idol Damian Sanders, OP 's Damian Tech boot( $259) is said to combine the flexibility of a soft boot with the convenience and carving precision of a hard one.( For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on page 59.) This unique boot has a stiff plastic lower shell that can be worn with a plate binding, but the rest of the boot looks like a soft boot cross-pollinated with a highback binding. It has soft-boot features, such as a leather lace-up upper, as well as binding features like shin and ankle straps( the latter is a ratcheted strap that wraps over the forefoot) and a stiff plastic highback mounted at the rear of the boot for support on heel-side turns. Another innovative approach comes from Sportsystem, the European boot and binding maker for Sims and Santa Cruz. Sportsystem has developed a soft boot that can claim two firsts : It 's rear-entry( i.e., it laces up the back, not the front), and it can be " pumped up " like a Reebok sneaker. Called the Airliner by Santa Cruz and the Inflator by Sims( both are $270), the boot features an air compressor and release valve on the bladder tongue that allow the rider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit. " Ski boot giant Nordica has entered the snowboarding market with two unique designs. Its SBS soft boot( $335) has a water-repellent zippered gaiter attached to a soft polyurethane cuff. Its three-buckle SBH( $370) is an overlap-type hard-shell boot with adjustable forward and lateral flex and a " ride/walk " switch that releases the back for walking, not unlike the " ski/walk " feature on some ski boots. BINDINGS To understand the latest binding developments, you have to understand how bindings are attached to boards. This issue is one of the most politically charged brouhahas in the industry. Again, more background. Snowboard bindings are mounted onto snowboards via two different anchoring systems : retention plates or threaded inserts. The retention-plate system is like that of skis : Holes are drilled through the topsheet of the board where the bindings will be placed, and self-tapping binding screws( i.e., ones that do n't require nuts) are coated with epoxy glue and then screwed into an aluminum or ABS retention plate sandwiched within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowboard comes with threaded mounting holes built right in. Usually the number of mounting holes in the board is greater than the number needed to actually hold the binding to board, giving the rider a variety of binding positions -- and therefore stances -- to choose from. Virtually all companies offer some models with inserts. Of the major players, Kemper, Morrow, Rossignol, and Aggression go exclusively with retention plates. The main advantage of retention plates, as they will tell you, is the unlimited choice of binding positions. The main disadvantage : To change the binding position, you must drill new holes in the board, which can ultimately weaken it. Using threaded inserts does offer the option of removing the binding or changing its position with just a screwdriver instead of a power drill, but if you want a stance angle or width that differs from the ones predetermined by a board 's inserts, you 're stuck. Also, the mounting screws can loosen, so they must be checked on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how with ski bindings, any binding can be attached to any ski? It does n't always work that way with snowboards. With retention plates you can mount any binding on any board. But with inserts, your binding must correspond to the hole pattern on the board. Usually this means buying the binding made by the same company -- which explains why almost every snowboard manufacturer also offers a binding, either under its own brand name or through a distribution deal with a binding maker. Okay, here 's where it gets interesting. Burton, the market-share leader in all equipment categories, has always been committed to inserts. Over the past few seasons, Nitro, LaMar, Lib Tech, and Barfoot, among others, have placed insert patterns in their boards that match the insert pattern used on Burton boards and bindings. Thus, Burton bindings could be used on their boards, and vice versa. Not exactly standardization, but it was better than nothing. This season Burton has thrown a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replaced it with its new 3D Interface Connection. The baseplate of each of Burton 's three binding models( one hard, two soft) is now fitted with a rotatable disk that is anchored to the board via three screws. Burton says it created the 3D Interface Connection for two reasons. Placing the screws nearer the center of the board, under the midfoot instead of at the toes( " central mounting "), creates less interference with the board 's flex pattern. In addition, making the binding rotatable combines the infinite stance options of a retention plate with the adjustability of an insert system. According to Burton 's math, the 3D Interface Connection allows 2,073,600 possible stances, with screwdriver-adjustable stance angles, stance width, boot centering, canting, heel lift, and toe lift. Skeptics wonder if the three screws can safely hold a binding onto a board( most other bindings use four or five), and whether the toe and/or heel area of the binding will lift off the board during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board. If it 's any consolation, we tested the 3D plate bindings in our ' ' 93 board test and sensed no apparent lift. Here 's the rub. The 3D bindings will only fit the insert pattern found on the ' ' 92- ' ' 93 Burton boards. So if you want to put this season 's Burton bindings on last season 's Burton board, or on a board made by any other manufacturer, you 're out of luck. Still, centrally mounted " rotating disk " binding systems could be the wave of the future. In fact, two other companies -- Sportsystem and F2( a European sail-board company) -- offer their own versions. BOARDS When it comes to snowboard shape, design concepts are flying around like shrapnel from an exploding fragmentation bomb.( For a rundown on shapes, see " Choose Your Weapon " on page 146.) In general, look for more one-piece cap constructions, versatile freeriding boards, and skateboard-inspired shapes. Lib Tech, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced the first " cap " snowboards in 1990, the same season Salomon debuted its cap ski. Now more companies are looking to wraparound construction for lighter weight and improved durability. Nitro 's new Jeff Davis Cerro freestyle model is built in the Elan factory with the same construction as Elan 's MBX ski. And F2, now in its second year of U.S. snowboard distribution, incorporates a " Monocoque " technology( hmmm, does Salomon know about this?) in its Beamer World Cup( $584 without bindings). Expect more companies to be thinking caps in the future. Alpine racing designs have traditionally received the most R &D; attention, and technological advances made in them are trickling down to freeriding and freestyle shapes. The result : versatile boards with high-powered, race-influenced performance. One of the most intriguing developments on this front is the Internal Asymmetric Shift( IAS) from Santa Cruz. Available in 156- and 165-cm lengths( $464 and $466, without bindings), IAS boards incorporate an asymmetric wood core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz, is a board with both the stability of symmetrical shapes and the snappy edge changes of asymmetrical models with offset sidecuts. Companies ca n't agree on whether symmetrical or asymmetrical boards are better, but just about everyone agrees that you must sell both to stay competitive. K2, a longtime devotee of symmetrical designs, has introduced its first asymmetrical model -- the limited-edition DC 162 slalom board( $465 without bindings). Specialization can extend even to flex patterns. Not only does Nitro offer both symmetrical and asymmetrical Alpine boards( the Amero and Epic, respectively), but it also is making some lengths available in a choice of either a soft flex for lighter riders or a stiffer flex for more aggressive or heavier riders. If you 're looking for one board that will take you anywhere -- and that 's most of us -- check out one of the new breed of freeriding boards, which are rapidly becoming the flagships of most manufacturers ' lines. Essentially, the freeriding category is equivalent to all-terrain skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestyle-type models in both asymmetrical and symmetrical shapes. Burton, for example, subdivides its freeriding line into Alpine and freestyle categories. Skiers should look into the Alpine-oriented M-Series. Though the asymmetrical M5.0 and M6.0( $470 with bindings) carve less powerfully than Burton 's PJ race models, their slightly wider waists, softer flex, and less extreme asymmetrical offset make them much more versatile in bumps and powder. The freestyle-oriented X-Class boards, consisting of the Asym Air 5 and Asym Air 6( $570 with bindings), ca n't match the M-series in carving, but with a soft flex pattern and an upturned( " kicked ") tip and tail, the Asym Airs are more suitable for riding fakie( backwards) and in the halfpipe. Skateboarding has always had a major influence on snowboard design, but as specialization has taken hold over the past few years, that influence has become limited to freestyle boards -- which is logical, since these boards are most at home doing tricks in the halfpipe, winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new example is Morrow 's SP( Spoon Nose) series( $549-$559, without bindings). The two SP boards have a scooped-out nose and tail( hey, like a spoon) resembling those of current skateboards. Morrow claims that this shape opens up an entire range of skatelike tricks in the halfpipe ; another benefit is that the nose and tail edges wo n't catch on the lip of the " pipe so readily -- just in case that ranks high on your list of concerns( or your kid 's). CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON What is the " best " shape for a snowboard? Throw this issue to a roundtable of snowboard designers and you 'll find about as much agreement among candidates at a Presidential debate. But one thing is certain : One shape will better suit your needs than the others. It all depends on your personal riding style : Alpine carving, all-around freeriding, or halfpipe. The industry does agree on the three basic snowboard shapes. One is symmetrical ; the other two are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways. Here are the specifics. Symmetrical. If you cut a symmetrical board in half from tip to tail, each half would be identical, a mirror image of the other( Fig. 1).( Figure 1 omitted) This is the most user-friendly design, suitable for everyone from beginners to World Cup competitors, who win races on symmetrical boards as often as on asyms. The symmetrical shape is applied to all model categories, from Alpine racing to freeriding and freestyle boards. Symmetricals are generally more stable, more predictable, and more forgiving, but reputedly less quick edge to edge than asyms. Which brings us to.... The original asym. Take a symmetrical board, cut it down the middle from tip to tail, and shift the heelside half back several centimeters( Fig. 2).( Figure 2 omitted) This is the basic geometry of an asym board with " shifted " sidecuts. Asyms were created in the mid ' ' 80s to compensate for a snowboarder 's inherently asymmetrical stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pressure on their heelside edges, they find it harder to carve a turn on that side. This is solved by aligning the center of the sidecuts under the feet for equally efficient turns on the toe and heel sides. Shifting the sidecuts also automatically moves a rider 's hips -- and center of mass -- back, which means less fore-aft movement over the board, making riding an asym less work. Under ideal situations -- a groomed slope and the ability to carve flawless, razor-sharp turns -- an asym board will ride quicker and carve better than a symmetrical board ; this quickness, however, also translates into a high-strung, less forgiving, less versatile board. Even the new asym freestyle boards, which have a lesser degree of offset, are more demanding than symmetrical boards. The other asym. Take a symmetrical board and give the heelside edge a deeper sidecut. Now you have the second type of asymmetrical shape( Fig. 3).( Figure 3 omitted) This shape first appeared a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is the same as that of its shifty cousin : to make heelside turns easier. This type of asym shape tends to be used in freestyle boards because it works best with the relatively flat stance favored by freestyle riders( i.e., a stance with the feet across the board or angled slightly forward). Alpine boards work best with a more forward stance. Also, quite a few models are " reversible " ; i.e., they have identical tip and tail shapes( symmetrical, whaddaya know), thus allowing the choice of a regular stance( left foot forward) or a goofy stance( right foot forward) by simply reversing the bindings. With the shifted asyms, which tend to have distinctly different nose and tail shapes, two versions, regular and goofy, must be manufactured. <p>
