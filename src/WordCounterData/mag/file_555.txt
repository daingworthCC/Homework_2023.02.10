4110941 The blowjob has fallen on hard times. Or, to put it in the form of a crude question, who can really get it up for fellatio these days? Back in the 1960s and ' 70s, fellatio was all the rage. Its curative powers are powerfully conveyed by the moment in John Updike 's Bech when the protagonist 's mistress tries " to bring his weakling member to strength by wrapping it in the velvet bandages of her lips. " Abandoning the protective modesty of fiction in the poem " Fellatio, " Updike celebrated the way " that each of these clean secretaries / at night, to please her lover, takes / a fountain into her mouth. " <p> When I first came across these lines, in 1972, aged fourteen, they seemed excitingly rude -- if a little yucky. Now, a harmless poem ca n't be expected to support a zeitgeisty theory, but something, evidently, was in the air : 1972 was the year of Deep Throat, about a woman with a clitoris in her throat, so that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seems like a premise dreamed up by feminists as a way of showing, in ludicrously exaggerated fashion, the underlying misogyny of male fantasies. Or maybe not so exaggerated after all. At roughly the same time, a joke made the rounds about the ideal woman being three feet tall with a flat head -- so you 'd have someplace to rest your beer while she gave you head. One way or another, the early ' 70s were a time when the culture was bigging up the blowjob. Tellingly, Bech 's mistress was " following less her own instincts than the exemplary drift of certain contemporary novels. " <p> Some of this enthusiasm lived on into the late twentieth century. In 1995 's To Die For, Nicole Kidman reacts with disingenuous astonishment to the story of how a famous broadcaster got her big break because a self-penned reference commended her ability to " suck your cock till your eyes pop out! "( Should n't that read " cave in " or " implode "?) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Amis 's The Information in which a male character proposes to a lady friend that they " do 68. " What 's that? she asks. " You do me and I owe you 1, " he shoots back. Later in the novel, the humiliation of failed writer Richard Tull is complete when his wife fellates his rival, the successful Gwyn Barry. <p> If this all seems rather quaint, then Susan Minot 's 2002 novella, Rapture -- about a single blowjob -- was perhaps a last, jaw-aching hurrah. A genuinely twenty-first-century spokesman can be found in Jonathan Franzen 's Freedom, in the form of young Joey Berglund, whose sexual maturity -- compared with the guys he 's at college with -- is conveyed simply and vehemently. Their yearnings center on the blowjob, which Joey considers " little more than a glorified jerkoff. " <p> I recently undertook a small survey of some more mature male friends, and the results, while not unanimous, were overwhelming. To speak plainly, given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating pussy to having their dicks sucked. Or, to put it in entirely numerical terms, 80 percent of males would opt for a 70 rather than a 68. And what about the other two men? Yes, you guessed it : They 're gay! To be strictly accurate, the heterosexual respondents were partial to this kind of thing -- but only in the mathematically blissful reciprocity of 70 minus 1. The gob-job continues to thrive in hetero pornography, of course, for the simple -- literally obvious -- reason that it lends itself to being filmed in a way that cunnilingus can not. <p> I 'm not claiming that the latter did not exist back in the 1970s, but it was regarded in much the same way as paying for a round at the bar : You had to do it, but if you could avoid it, you did. It would be a mistake, though, to see this change as meaning that men have gone from being selfish recipients to selfless givers of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As the Michael Fassbender character in Shame says to a woman he 's seducing in a bar by telling her how badly he wants to go down on her( before getting beaten up by her boyfriend) : " That 's what I like to do. " <p> The scale of the sea change can be observed at the Great Canadian Beaver-Eating Contest, at Burning Man, an event so popular that participants line up as if for a half-off sale. In the more discreet context of my survey, this enthusiasm was endorsed by the respondent who claimed that the only time he experienced " absolute contentment " was when his face was between his wife 's legs. He wished to make clear that he was not talking just about sex ; he meant in life generally. <p> EIGHT OF TEN MEN PREFERRED PERFORMING CUNNILINGUS TO GETTING HEAD.
