Wait till you see the ways these clever moms saved thousands on everyday expenses There are two kinds of shoppers in this world : those who look for a bargain and those who live for a bargain.

Here are three of these savvy savers -- and the secrets that help them save a bundle. Photograph : $3,000 What Jonni McCoy saved on groceries in one year PHOTOGRAPH BY STEVEN PUETZER/MASTERFILE SUPERMARKET SMARTY Jonni McCoy Why she became a guerrilla One day 17 years ago, McCoy told her husband, Beau, that she had a plan : In order to quit working and stay at home with their two kids, she would learn to live on half their income. " He gave me four months to figure it out or we would have to move, " says McCoy, of Colorado Springs. Before her time was up, she and her family were living within their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it First, she analyzed. McCoy, 49, started meticulously saving grocery receipts, recording the everyday and sale prices of the foods she bought regularly. This enabled her to identify which markets offered the best deals on specific products. Based on her research, she established a list of preferred stores and reorganized her family 's meals around their flyers -- each week, she would cook whatever was featured in the mega-bargain ads on the front and back pages.( The purpose of these " loss leaders " is to get you into the grocery store ; once you 're there, companies figure, you 'll buy lots of items that are not on sale.) But this shopper stuck strictly to the bargains. " By planning menus around them, I could save 35 percent on the average grocery bill, " says McCoy, who now runs the Web site Miserlymoms.com. McCoy also began cooking two meals at a time : one for dinner and another for the freezer. " That way, when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry rather than spend money in a restaurant, " she says. McCoy lowered her grocery bills even more by making family favorites from scratch instead of buying more-expensive store versions. A month 's worth of homemade chocolate syrup for the kids, for instance, costs just $1. Biggest challenge " Finding less-expensive substitutes for the name-brand cereals that my kids really love, " she says. " We compromised. I buy in bulk when the name brands go on sale. " Not worth the effort Food prep that takes time with little financial payoff. " Although creating granola from scratch was a bargain, making marshmallows from scratch was a waste. They took four hours, did n't taste very good, and a bag at the store only costs $1, " McCoy says. Nor is she a warehouse-club fan. " I 've done the math, " she says. " You can save more buying a month 's worth of toilet paper or peanut butter on sale at your grocery store than paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In year one, McCoy saved $3,000-plus on groceries -- more than half her usual bill. CAR-COST CUTTER Nikki Willhite Finding money under the hood Willhite, 57, of Federal Way, WA, is something of a fanatic about lowering the cost of purchasing and maintaining the family car. How she does it Willhite saves on car payments by finding a dirt-cheap automobile loan and looking for substantial rebates. She also looks for good-condition " fleet vehicles " -- used cars that have been owned by salespeople or car-rental agencies. And Willhite tries to buy her wheels at the end of the model year, when car dealers are typically making room for new stock and are eager to unload the old stuff. Sample deal Willhite just purchased a 2007 Ford Escape for $24,000. When she was ready to buy the SUV, she did n't just hit the showrooms. Instead, she hunted for auto-loan-rate specials at dealers. When she found Ford promoting a zero percent loan, she pounced. Willhite put down $5,000 at the dealer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying roughly $3,000 in interest on a bank loan. Her rental trick The car that the SUV replaced was a ' ' 91 Geo Prizm. How did she keep it running so long? When a major family trip is in the offing, Willhite likes to rent a car rather than drive her own older model. " In the long run, I think it 's better to rent for a vacation than risk having to make expensive repair payments, " she says. Proof positive : After 15 years of driving the Prizm, she recently passed the car onto her son Kevin since it still ran well. SAVER WITH STYLE Susan Harrison Why she became a guerrilla " My father was always looking for the best deal when I was growing up, and the hunt for a bargain has been something I enjoy, " says Harrison, 39, a part-time environmental engineer in Greenville, SC. But what had been a pastime became mandatory after she had three kids, including twin sons, now 5. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a limit to what I will take out of the family budget for their clothes, " she says. " They grow out of things so quickly. " How she does it Harrison approaches consignment sales like a pro. In her area, three organizations run periodic sales of kids ' clothing : the Mothers of Multiples Club ; Mothers of Preschoolers ; and Trunk Treasures, a local group. All offer seasonal clothing at big discounts, but Harrison does more than just show up and shop. She joined these groups so she can volunteer to work at the tables -- that way she gets first dibs on the merchandise. " Before the sales start, I make a list of what my kids will need for the upcoming season, " she says. " I stick to the list and do n't overspend, no matter how cute something is. " Typically, Harrison pays 33 to 50 percent of the retail price for her children 's outfits.( Other good sources : kids ' consignment shops -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to school Harrison has also never missed the annual uniform sale at the private school her 8-year-old daughter, Anna, attends. " I 've found great deals there, " she says. Dollar discipline When Harrison is at a store and chances upon a must-have for herself, her husband, or the kids, she goes home and searches the Web for a better price. " If I ca n't find it on eBay or somewhere else online, I have to decide whether we really need it or if it 's something we can live without, " she says. Consignment bonus Harrison also favors shopping these sales for baby-shower gifts. " I 've found some great outfits that still had the tags on them, " she says. " If they 're cute, I 'll put them aside because someone is always having a baby. " <p>
