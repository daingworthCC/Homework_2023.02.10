2019541 Costly to Consumers <p> Much has been done, in Congress and at federal regulatory agencies, to " civilize " the automobile ; by making it less polluting, more efficient, and more safe. These improvements, however, have not come without costs to consumers. In the following article, Dr. Lave examines the drawbacks of making the automobile more socially responsible. A version of this article was presented at a recent Consumers ' Research symposium on " Science and Regulation. "( See " Science Behind Recent Regulations Questioned, " CR, July 1991.) -Ed. <p> We ca n't live with cars and we ca n't live without them. Automobiles consume almost half the petroleum used in the United States. They are responsible for more than 40,000 deaths each year, 3 million injuries, and billions of dollars in property damage. They are the largest source of air pollution in cities and send millions of Americans into speechless rage every day in traffic jams. <p> At the same time automobiles provide unmatched freedom and mobility. They provide a major foundation for American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suburbs stems from the availability of cars. In many places it is impossible to shop for groceries, see a movie, or visit a physician without a car. As a result, society is reluctant, almost unwilling, to take away the driver 's license of people who are not suitable drivers, such as alcoholics, those who regularly have crashes, or those who have lost their mental or physical abilities to drive safely. In America, getting a driver 's license is the real symbol of coming of age. <p> Cars are used to flaunt wealth and live out fantasies. People buying cars with price tags exceeding $30,000 are not just buying transportation. Someone buying a sports car designed for operation above 100 miles an hour, with a price tag in excess of $100,000, is acting out a fantasy-and presumably planning to drive vastly in excess of the speed limit on a regular basis. <p> When our elected representatives or regulatory agencies turn their attention to automobiles, they find it difficult to separate society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Externalities " <p> Automobiles have undesired effects on people other than their occupants. In deciding which car to buy and how to operate it, each driver is making decisions that affect the safety and environment of other people and the operations of other cars. <p> There is no direct market mechanism to provide incentives for individuals to make decisions that are in the public interest, rather than in their more narrow private interest. In cases where externalities are important, some social or government action is needed to allocate resources efficiently. <p> The largest externalities of the automobile are :( 1) highway congestion,( 2) injuries from crashes, and( 3) emissions causing air pollution. Other important externalities are noise, water pollution due to people dumping used motor oil down the drain, leaky underground storage tanks, abandoned cars, etc. ; they are less important than the big three. <p> Some other undesired side effects of cars receive more public attention. For example, transportation uses about 60% of the petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority. However, the price of gasoline covers most of the effects of petroleum use. Land use and life style are other central issues. The vast proportion of land in the city center is devoted to streets or parking lots( sometimes streets act as both). Highway noise, air pollution, and danger make living in the city center undesirable ; many people have moved to the suburbs. This use of land may be an important social issue, but there is n't an important technical issue here and I can safely leave this one for bold politicians. <p> In the table on page 16 are my estimates of the social costs of the three largest sources of automobile externalities. Somewhat surprisingly, highway congestion is the most important externality, costing drivers and passengers more than $60 billion per year. I estimate that more than 40 million hours are lost each day in traffic jams throughout the United States-more than 10 billion hours per year. A very conservative estimate of the cost of delay is $6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a better estimate, the cost of congestion is more than $100 billion per year. <p> The next most important externality is highway crashes, costing about $50 billion per year. The 45,000 highway deaths, 3 million injuries, and extensive property damage exact a large toll. These costs are the sum of medical care expenditures and time lost from work. The pain and suffering associated with injury and the grief of family and friends could make this figure considerably higher. <p> The third externality, air pollution from automobiles, may seem surprisingly small, considering the amount of public attention it receives. Air pollution from automobiles is estimated to cost society about $10 billion per year. This low cost is due in large part to the fact that pollution emissions from new cars have been reduced by 95% or more under the Clean Air Act. Social Conflict <p> As responsible citizens, the vast majority of Americans recognize these three problems and understand that some sort of social or government action is needed to alleviate them. People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, as advised by bumper stickers, many of them " honk for eliminating traffic jams. " Nearly all of us have a friend who was killed or severely injured in a highway crash. Almost 2% of us will die in a highway crash and many of us will be injured enough to require medical care. Most of us have experienced the unpleasant levels of smog that impair visibility, can make breathing difficult, and can cause eye irritation. These problems are apparent and many of us tell our representatives to solve them. <p> We also ask our representatives to enhance fuel efficiency so that the United States will not import so much oil. We want drunk and dangerous drivers off the road and many of us want the traffic laws enforced and want cars to be built so that they can be recycled. <p> However, we wear a different hat when we go to dealers and look at new cars. As car buyers, we want style, performance, luxury, comfort, and reliability. Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on a safe car. <p> Unfortunately, we have quite different things on our minds when we talk with our representatives than when we shop for a new car. A " sensible " car that got fuel economy, was safe, had low emissions, and low operating costs would not compete well with the luxury or muscle cars. While sensible, it would be more expensive than the economy cars. The higher price tag would mean that some people could no longer afford the car. Insisting on safety and other socially desirable characteristics has the effect of denying cars to would-be purchasers with the lowest income. <p> Even high-income purchasers suffer " sticker shock " due in part to the price increases stemming from safety, fuel economy, and emissions regulations. Although people want cars to be safer, many object to wearing their seat belts. Thus, there is a dissonance between our actions as citizens and our actions as car buyers and drivers. Fuel Efficiency Regulation <p> More stringent " corporate average fuel economy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention. Since the most economical cars currently being sold get more than 50 miles per gallon( mpg), there is no question that better fuel economy is technically feasible. Whether it is desirable is more complicated. <p> Greater fuel efficiency would lower petroleum use, and thus lower petroleum imports. This would make us less dependent on OPEC, would lower world oil prices, and would also lead to less domestic oil use, preserving our reserves. Better fuel economy would lead to less air pollution. For some people, more fuel-efficient cars represent an improvement in life style ; these cars would be less wasteful. Since stringent CAFE standards would increase the price of new cars, it would lead to fewer cars being sold and perhaps to less congestion. <p> Unfortunately, better fuel economy is not an unalloyed good. Getting better fuel economy from a car of the same size and performance requires substituting lighter, more expensive materials-e.g., plastics or aluminum for steel-or using a more expensive engine. Thus, to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance, cost and price will increase. Alternatively, the car can be made smaller or horsepower( and performance) reduced. Even if the price is not increased, a smaller, lower performance car is less desirable, and thus worth less to buyers. <p> In addition, a lighter car is inherently less safe in a crash. This is particularly true if the car is smaller as well as lighter, but it is still true if the car is the same size, but lighter. Thus, increasing fuel efficiency has both benefits and costs. Pushing the fuel economy of new cars from 27.5 mpg to 32, 40, or 80 mpg is not necessarily desirable socially. Some careful calculations are needed of the social benefits and social costs for each mile per gallon increase in fuel efficiency. <p> Without higher fuel prices, requiring Detroit to produce 40 mpg cars can not work. At current fuel prices, consumers want cars to average 27.5 mpg or less. If Detroit offered more fuel-efficient cars that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most buyers would prefer current models. That is precisely what happened in the mid 1980s to General Motors and Ford. Both offered a mix of models that they thought would allow them to achieve a fleet average of 27.5 mpg, the government standard. However, consumers wanted to purchase many more of the large, less fuel-efficient cars than auto makers had planned. People were acting differently when they wore their car buyer hat than when they wore their voter hat. The result was that both auto makers could not meet the standard. One Cadillac and Two Geos <p> Suppose that the government insisted that auto makers meet the standard, even if people wanted the large cars and did n't want the small ones. Assume that the government requires General Motors to have its new cars average 40 mpg-or they ca n't sell cars. Now assume that someone goes into a Cadillac dealer and wants to buy a $30,000 car that gets 20 mpg. The dealer would have to refuse to sell the car, but might offer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars : One Cadillac and two Geos( each costing $12,000 and getting 50 mpg). The three cars together average 40 mpg. <p> The purchaser might scratch his head : " I do n't want to buy two Geos. " <p> " Fine, " says the dealer, " I will resell them for you. But I ca n't get anyone to buy them at $12,000. The best price I can get is $8,000. Thus, the package of three cars will cost you $54,000, but I will refund you $16,000 for reselling the two Geos. " <p> The purchaser responds : " Wait a minute! That means the Cadillac is costing me $38,000, not the sticker price of $30,000. I want to buy the car at the sticker price. " <p> " I would like to sell you the Cadillac at the sticker price, but the government wo n't let me. The public elected Congressmen who insist that the average new car must get 40 mpg. So the only way I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is fanciful. But, if the government insists that the average car sold by General Motors( or any other car company) gets 40 mpg while consumers want to buy cars averaging 25 mpg, there is a contradiction. The contradiction could be resolved by General Motors ' adding a " gas guzzler " premium to its large, relatively inefficient cars and subsidizing the price of its extremely efficient cars. The premium and subsidy would have to convince General Motors ' customers to buy a mix of cars that meets the standard. <p> There are two additional problems with attempting to compel fuel efficiency increases without increasing the price of gasoline. The first is that cheap gasoline would lead people to drive more than they would with expensive gasoline. For example, someone with a recreational vehicle is n't likely to drive as many miles at $2 per gallon as at $1 per gallon. Thus, the effect of cheap gasoline is to induce people to drive more, using more gasoline. <p> The second difficulty is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade in their old cars. Since these older vehicles tend to get poor fuel economy and have much higher emissions than new cars, regulations that make new cars more expensive can be counterproductive. <p> Insisting on fuel economy standards without increasing the price of gasoline is a recipe for trouble. It would decrease the number of new cars sold, leading to greater emissions. Keeping old cars in service and keeping gasoline prices low would increase fuel use so that the result might be little or no decrease in petroleum use. If government mandates higher fuel economy standards, the new standards must be accompanied by gasoline taxes that would raise the price enough to induce consumers to desire, or at least accept, the fuel-efficient cars. Emission Standards <p> In the mid 1960s, automobile emissions were the largest source of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, leading to high levels of smog. The 1991 car models have reduced their emissions of these pollutants by 95%. If old cars met the same emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxidants. Only recently have regulators started to focus on sources of unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides other than cars. They still have much more stringent regulations for cars than for other sources. <p> California has been regulating automobile emissions since before the federal government started ; they continue to have the power to set different standards, as long as their standards are more stringent. Recently, a number of states have begun to consider whether to adopt the more stringent-and expensive-California standards. Doing so would not be in the public interest for two reasons. <p> The first is that tightening new car emissions standards would have only a tiny effect on automobile emissions. Many of the cars on the road were built to satisfy less stringent standards when new. If they could be replaced by cars built to satisfy current standards, then emissions levels would fall. More importantly, emissions increase with the age of a vehicle. Old vehicles-or newer vehicles that are gross polluters-can emit more than 100 times the level of pollution per mile driven. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total emissions. Obviously, the air would become much cleaner if the older vehicles could be retired and if the gross polluters were required to comply. But the more stringent standards increase the price of new cars, inducing people to keep the old cars in service longer. Having " good " new cars can lead to better air quality than insisting on " excellent " new cars. <p> The second reason is that new cars are a minor source of air pollution compared with stationary sources and gross polluters. It makes no sense to single out new cars for stringent regulation. Congress and state legislatures seem to be locked into the idea that, since automobile emissions regulation accomplished a great deal in the past, the more stringent standards could accomplish much more in the future. They are deluding themselves. The air would get cleaned up much more quickly and cheaply by focusing on old cars and stationary sources. Regulatory Contradictions <p> Congress enacted legislation in 1965 requiring that cars be made safer ; they passed legislation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in 1975 requiring that cars become more fuel efficient. Although they did n't realize it, these three laws are in conflict. <p> Making cars safer requires adding safety features that add weight, which decreases fuel economy. Emission control features have tended to add weight and decrease combustion temperature, lowering fuel efficiency. The fuel efficiency standards have decreased the weight and size of cars, making them less safe. <p> All three laws have increased the cost of manufacturing a car and tended to reduce comfort, performance, and other attributes that consumers desire. The result has been that fewer new cars are sold and used cars are kept longer. Running used cars for a longer time has increased the number of less-safe, more-polluting, and less fuel-efficient cars on the road. Conclusion <p> The automobile generates huge benefits and huge costs for the United States. Regulation has improved safety performance, although at the cost of more expensive automobiles and intruding on personal behavior( buckling seat belts). Regulation has succeeded in vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental consequences. Little has been done to alleviate congestion, despite the large improvements that could be had. <p> Congress has gotten enthusiastic about mandating fuel efficiency increases. Unfortunately, greater fuel efficiency has large costs in the form of more highway deaths and injuries. A careful analysis is needed as to how much additional fuel efficiency is desired. <p> If Congress does n't raise petroleum taxes as it regulates fuel efficiency, other petroleum users will continue their profligate use. More importantly, without gasoline price increases, fuel savings will be reduced by the inducement to drive more miles and to keep old cars in service longer. <p> Tightening emissions standards for new cars is much less cost-effective than reducing emissions from gross polluters and stationary sources. Congress and the legislatures have to get out of the habit of thumping on this drum in order to achieve cleaner air. <p> In regulating the automobile, Congress and the regulatory agencies need to be reminded of the inherent contradictions between safety, emissions, fuel economy, and the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more difficult than Congress thinks. <p> By Dr. Lester B. Lave <p> <p> Dr. Lave is a professor of economics and engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Penn. <p> SOCIAL COSTS OF AUTOMOBILES TABLE <p> SOURCES : A Report to Congress, Atlanta : Centers for Disease Control, 1989 ; Krupnick, Alan J. and Paul R.

RAISE FUEL PRICES <p> The current focus on improving the fuel efficiency of cars makes no sense. Petroleum is also used by commercial and private aircraft, by power boats, recreational vehicles, and petrochemical products. If society is determined to reduce petroleum consumption, in addition to increasing automobile efficiency we could ban foam plastic cups and synthetic fabrics ; we could require that commercial and private aircraft meet fuel efficiency standards. We could ban power boats or restrict the allowable horsepower. We could require recreational vehicles to meet the same fuel efficiency standards as cars. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up nylon or campers. People who like to water ski or who own large power boats are n't eager to agree to restrict boat engines to a single horsepower. Yet it makes no sense to press hard on fuel efficiency for automobiles while neglecting other ways to save petroleum. <p> Congressmen may think they understand the issues and can prescribe the fuel efficiency of new vehicles. I doubt any member of Congress would like to set efficiency standards for power boats, recreational vehicles, commercial aircraft, private aircraft, petrochemicals, and other petroleum uses. Nor are the regulatory agencies anxious-or able-to set such standards for all petroleum uses. <p> One way to send consistent signals across the economy is to increase the price of petroleum. At $40 per barrel, airlines, power boat users, and purchasing managers would receive a uniform signal about how much petroleum to use. At some higher price, most purchasing managers would decide to switch from foam cups to paper cups. At a high price for jet fuel, airlines would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As happened in the 1970s, car buyers would see the additional fuel costs and many would decide on more fuel-efficient cars. In short, a higher price for petroleum sends a uniform signal to conserve petroleum. Putting a large tax on petroleum not only motivates car buyers to purchase fuel efficient cars, it also motivates airlines, powerboat users, and cup purchasers. <p> By Lester B. Lave <p>
