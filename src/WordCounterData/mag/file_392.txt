4023441 AN ORGANIC FARMER AND CONSCIENTIOUS SHOPPER TAKES ON THE CHALLENGE OF ELIMINATING PLASTIC BAGS FROM HER HOME. // As my family continues to search for a viable replacement for the plastic bags we use on our farm, I decided to see what I could do to help eliminate the ones we use off the farm. In some areas, we are fine : We do n't buy sandwich bags or any small kind like that. I 'll admit I have n't yet attempted to replace the plastic trash bags we use to line our kitchen trash can, either, but I had to start somewhere, so I began with the plastic grocery bag. It is amazing when you start to observe how these bags sneak into nearly every household in massive numbers. Here are some disturbing facts to think about : * The Wall Street Journal reports that American consumers go through 100 billion plastic shopping bags annually. * Plastic bags are among the 12 items of debris most often found in coastal clean-ups, according to the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. * Plastic bags do n't biodegrade ; they photodegrade-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterways and entering the food web when animals accidentally ingest them. A hundred billion shopping bags a year! Yikes! What can we do about it? My own research discovered that any kind of disposable bag option which is n't plastic is nearly 10 times more expensive. Most retailers are n't willing to take that step, even if it is better for the environment. There is, however, another large-scale option : In 2002, Ireland introduced a plastic-bag tax, or PlasTax. For every plastic bag a store gives to a consumer, the customer is taxed 22 euro-cents( that 's 29 cents U.S.). The goal was to raise consumers ' awareness and encourage them to reuse bags. The tax has been hugely successful, cutting plastic-bag consumption by 1.2 billion bags a year-a staggering 90 percent! All the tax money( 9.6 million euros in the first year) went into a green fund set up to benefit the environment. Another bonus for our petroleum-dependent world : In five years, an estimated 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil were saved due to decreased production of bags. Now, I 'm no statistics expert, but according to my own basic calculations, if the U.S. had followed Ireland 's example and cut plastic-bag rates by 90 percent in 2002, we would have saved close to 400 million gallons of oil in that five-year period! Until such a wonderbill gets introduced, I 'm afraid it 's up to us, the individual consumers, to try to make a difference. This brings me back to my own personal family quest. My next step was to assemble a reusable-bag kit. I gathered all the canvas totes in the house. It surprised me how many I already owned-one from the library 's summer reading program, a mesh beach-type bag from my mom, two of our own " 14-Acre Farm " canvas bags, two that came with hand-me-downs. I threw in a small soft cooler/lunch kit and I was ready. The next part is where the challenge began. I had to remember to bring them with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the car for a little while before I got this far. On my first shopping trip with the kit, I stuffed the three largest bags full to the top in the self-serve aisle. They were absurdly heavy. I made a mental note not to overfill them next time. Since then, I 've also learned the secret of the self-serve area from my friend Diane : Put the bags in the bag area first ; then have the clerk reset the scale. It saves irritation for all involved. Despite these minor inconveniences, it was so easy to deal with my groceries! No struggling with 20-plus little plastic bags, all ripping and with things falling out of them. Just 1-2-3 done! Unloading was the same. On my next grocery-store visit, I proudly displayed my own bags. The clerk did n't seem to get it. She questioned, " So you want to put all of your groceries in those bags? You do n't want any plastic bags? " I assured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bags. The woman checking out in the aisle next to me was obviously feeling a bit defensive about using plastic bags. She began a litany aimed at her clerk about environmentalists and who has time and what do they want from us, and so on. I guess not everybody is ready for the PlasTax, but I like to think positive-maybe next time she 'll be more aware of how many bags she 's using. When I unloaded my bags, I discovered that the clerk had put the tortilla chips and yogurt in a plastic bag in one of the canvas bags. I 've since been stuck with a few bags because I was too polite to say anything after the clerk had already started bagging. My newest trick is to place my bags first on the belt, before my purchases. Then I can explain myself while stalling them. It is commonly said that it takes 21 days to form a new habit. I have a feeling that once this month is up, I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash bags and finally figure out something for our farm customers... The clerk did n't seem to get it. She questioned, " So you want to put all of your groceries in those bags? You do n't want any plastic bags? " // Author Affiliation Sara Ruch grows and sells vegetables with her husband.
