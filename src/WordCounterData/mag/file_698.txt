Make a splash with your " pond in a pot " in just an hour or two with these simple instructions. 1. Select waterproof container at least 12 inches deep and 16 inches in diameter and with dark interior to give impression of greater depth and to camouflage algae growth. 2. Rinse container with water and place in an often-viewed spot that gets at least four hours of daily sunshine. 3. Fill container with water.( Tip : Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon so do n't count on moving your mini-pond once it 's filled!) 4. Submerge 3 potted water lilies from local nursery in container ; more will look crowded as plants spread. 5. Check water level daily and fill as needed. Bring indoors or discard when temperatures dip below 55 degrees. #
