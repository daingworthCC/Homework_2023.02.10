2002141 From discoveries about the universe we live in to products created here on earth, we salute 100 of 1994 's top science and technology achievements with our seventh annual Best of What 's New Awards. This year saw the discovery of one of matter 's tiniest building blocks and that of the first planets outside our solar system. Closer to home, $1 prescription eyeglasses were invented as was a test to diagnose heart-attack victims quickly. The products honored this year promise a not-too-distant future of greater ease and enjoyment : Included are a microwave clothes dryer, a car that remembers cabin settings, safer in-line skates, and a computer that 's also a cable-ready TV, stereo, speaker phone, and game machine all rolled into one. Continuing a tradition, we have selected a Grand Winner in each of ten categories. The Light Fantastic A conventional flashlight 's flaw is obvious : You need a third hand to use it while you 're working. So Black &; Decker 's SnakeLight loops, twists, and bends to suit any task. You can wrap it over your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to stand on its own. SnakeLight comes in three versions for home, workshop, and automotive uses and costs from $30 to $35. Fossil Mammals See them jump! See them climb! See them hunt! The awesome critters in a spectacular new addition to New York 's American Museum of Natural History, from giant elk to a ferocious " bear-dog, " are mounted in poses that reflect their lifestyles in past eras. Complemented by interactive computer displays, the uniquely informative exhibits are organized so that the visitor moves through them in a remarkably intuitive and user-friendly way along a major evolutionary tree. The Bug Is Back VW 's Concept I is a modern-day revival of the car that once defined the automotive counterculture. Today the styling seems fresh once again. But more important, the car 's three different powerplant design options -- including an innovative diesel/electric hybrid -- explore the outer reaches of fuel efficiency and alternative power. The concept may well become a reality, if VW goes ahead with announced plans to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,700-pound eight-legged robot named Dante II wowed scientists with an adventurous trek across the crater of an active volcano. Braving falling boulders and earthquakes, the semiautonomous machine took video images and sampled the gases from vents in the rocky ground. Although Dante II needed help to get out -- it had tipped over and had to be retrieved by helicopter -- it demonstrated that robots can successfully explore distant, dangerous places. Ultimate EOS Canon 's top-of-the-line autofocus single-lens-reflex 35mm camera, the EOS-1, has now been topped by the EOS-1N. The new model adds a host of improvements that meets the special needs of professionals and advanced amateurs, including : mirror lock-up to prevent vibration, silent rewind, the ability to focus quickly on any of five different points, and five metering patterns. The camera 's list price is approximately $2,400. Synthesizing Virtuosity The best musicians can push a technically well-played tune to artistry by adding personally distinctive sounds, such as the squeaks from over-blowing a horn or breathiness from under-puffing an oboe. But no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce such natural sounds-until now. The $4,995 Yamaha VL1 Virtual Acoustic Synthesizer lets keyboardists add emphasis by puffing through its innovative headset. Island of Mystery The $60 Myst is multimedia intrigue at its best, exploiting the CD-ROM format like no other entertainment software. The adventure game transports you to an island world with beautifully drawn 3-D graphics, mystery-shrouded video clips, eerie sound effects, and an original musical score. These elements complement a story line that 's intelligent enough to lure adults -- and unpredictable enough to keep them coming back. Model Notebook Toshiba 's Portege establishes new standards for small, lightweight notebook computers. It is the first " sub-notebook " to sport a brilliant thin-film-transistor color screen, and the first portable PC of any kind to use the long-lasting lithium-ion battery. The newest model, the Portege T3600CT, beefs up internally with a 50-megahertz 486DX2 chip, a 250-megabyte hard disk, and eight megabytes of memory. Price : $1,299 to $4,799. Grand Award Aviation &; Space Cosmic Catastrophe When the fragments of comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of hydrogen bombs, virtually every major telescope was focused on the event. The spectacle alone was worth it : The largest fragment produced a fireball 50 times brighter to infrared telescopes than the planet itself. Astronomers say that collected data will reveal information about Jupiter 's composition and help explain how previous comets may have affected life on Earth. The Clean Diesel Long-haul diesel proponents now have a truly modern choice : Mercedes-Benz engineers have satisfied the clean-air agencies in all 50 states with a six-cylinder engine design that attacks the dual demons of diesel combustion : soot and oxides of nitrogen. Precombustion chambers in the four-valve-per-cylinder head and an oxidation catalyst combine with exhaust-gas recirculation and a variable air-intake system -- both under microchip control -- for cleaner warmup and cruising. E300 diesel sedans start at $40,000. Over-The-Air Cable TV Cost-cutting competition for your cable-TV company typically does n't exist. Now, wireless technology that costs a fraction of building a ground-based cable system promises to give you more for your cable-TV dollar. CellularVision of New York has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A small transmitter sends the same programming produced by cable-TV companies over the air to receiving antennas that are within a three-mile radius. Light At The End Of The Chunnel After centuries of pondering and puttering, the Channel Tunnel( or " Chunnel ") finally opened this May for freight service amidst much fanfare. A grand engineering accomplishment, the 31-mile-long, three-tube system -- the world 's longest underwater tunnel -- was bored out of the sticky chalk that lines the bottom of the English Channel. The rail passage between Great Britain and France will enable cars, trucks, and passengers to travel between Folkestone, England, and Calais, France, connecting England with Europe for the first time since the Ice Age. The Never-Set VCR Clock Now you can impress your family, friends, and neighbors with your apparent ability to program your VCR -- if you have Sony 's SLV-770HF( $599) or SLV-920HF( $649) models. These VCRs automatically set their own display clocks by using a chip that reads a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV signal that is reserved for extended data services. Rough Rover Reflecting the heritage and off-road capability that sets Range Rover apart, the Land Rover Discovery is a prestige sport utility at a reasonable, $29,525 base price. Its aluminum body and a long-travel suspension engineered for hard use add up to an unusual capacity for hard going. Comfortable seating, good ergonomics, a big cargo area, and rugged styling lend a luxury-car feel to a vehicle that 's equally at home in the wilds. Two Lines From One AT &T; Paradyne 's DataPort 2001 modem( $549) is first to let you talk and send data simultaneously over one standard phone line. Assuming the person at the other end has a compatible modem, two people could be looking at the same computer screen, for example, while conversing. This VoiceSpan technology is also expected to show up in some dedicated fax machines, making it possible for two people to talk and fax on one line. Peer Through Walls Zircon 's prototype radar locator does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of LEDs. But using ultra-wideband radar technology developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the tool is the first radar that can identify steel, wood, and plastic tubing hidden behind heretofore-impenetrable materials such as concrete, as well as drywall. Future versions of the tool could assist in search-and-rescue operations in collapsed buildings. Batter Up! Step up to the plate and swing away against simulated big-league pitchers with Sports Sciences ' Batter Up, a fusion of video game and batting cage. As a ball appears to come toward you, on the monitor, you swing a life-size soft-foam bat with an embedded infrared transmitter that sends a signal when the bat is swung with force. The handle houses all the controls needed for game play. Batter Up works with Nintendo 's SNES, Sega Genesis, and Sega CD baseball titles. Price : $129( cordless) or $69( corded). Grand Award Recreation Easy Rider Bicycle maker Girvin did n't reinvent the wheels, but it did engineer several other features into the Proflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to having front and rear shock absorbers, the Proflex adds a radical frame design. The compact main triangle allows for a longer rear-suspension unit than other bikes, to soak up big bumps. The frame also enables those under five feet, five inches in height to comfortably traverse the outback with full-sized wheels. Price : about $1,599. Unshackling The Circular Saw DeWalt cuts ahead of other battery-powered tool makers with cordless circular saws that have a blade large enough to saw through a 2x4 on a single swipe. The saws, which are equipped with a 5-3/8-inch thin-kerf carbide blade, are available with either a 12- or 14.4-volt rechargeable battery. The 14.4-volt DW935K model is available for about $230 ; the 12-volt DW930K, $200. 24-Hour Video-Game Delivery The Sega Channel demonstrates that cable can deliver more than just programs. Households can now receive video games through a channel that is dedicated to data transmission. The data is sent to a memory cartridge that is inserted into the game-cartridge port of any Sega Genesis System. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are offered regularly. Subscribers should pay about $14 a month in addition to their basic cable bill. Powerful Package The PowerPC microprocessor 's promise becomes reality in Apple 's Power Macintosh series. Propelled by the efficient **32;433;TOOLONG( RISC) chip, Power Macs zip through complex tasks far more quickly than previous Macs -- or most Windows PCs. For scientific, math, and graphics work, Power Macs are the hands-down champions. Add speech recognition and Windows-compatibility options, and you 've got the most versatile PCs around. Cost : about $2,000 to $4,500. Running With Fury Reebok 's Instapump Fury running shoe has everything you need -- and nothing you do n't. The midsole was cut out because runners hit the pavement with the heels and balls of their feet, rather than the middle. Replacing " heavy " leather and laces are light, breathable mesh and air bladders that inflate with an on-board Pump button or a C0 sub 2 cartridge. Each Instapump Fury weighs 8.5 ounces -- 25 percent less than most running shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By all but proving Fermat 's famously intractable Last Theorem, a Princeton University mathematician may have solved a 300-year-old problem. The theorem is simple to state : The equation x sup n + y sup n = z sup n can not be solved when exponent n is greater than 2. But the proof is anything but simple : It took Andrew Wiles more than 200 pages of dense formulas. Understandably, Wiles accidentally left out a step, which he is now working on. In any case, colleagues agree that the breakthrough work will make a lasting contribution to their field. Appointment Watcher From bars of light flashing across a computer screen, the Timex Data Link Watch takes only seconds to load up to 27 entries of weekly appointments, pertinent phone numbers, and anniversary reminders. The watch 's light sensor reads the flashing light bars, communicating the information to the watch. The pulses of light equate to the digital ones and zeros that computers use to run programs. The $130 watch comes with the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room 's dimensions just got immeasurably easier. The first laser measuring tool, Disto shoots a beam of light to any object from eight inches to approximately 300 feet away, then displays the distance in English or metric units. Unlike ultrasonic devices, the red laser-light dot produced by Disto shows that you 've aimed as intended. Accurate to within 1/8 inch, Disto was developed by Leica AG and is also marketed by Sonin. The measuring tool costs about $1,400. Luxury Redefined A sporting sedan that handles a party of four in comfort, the Oldsmobile Aurora represents a new, from-the-ground-up approach to luxury-car design. Starting with a body structure that sets new standards for rigidity, the Aurora adds refined suspension tuning for solid road manners and high performance. With its new aluminum 32-valve V8, the Aurora takes a high-tech route to producing power in a small-displacement engine. Base price : $31,995. Grand Award Audio &; Video Dish It Up Now you do n't have to go to the video store or have a cable hookup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satellite System( DSS), you simply press a few keys on your remote control to watch pay-per-view movies beamed from a satellite. DSS also provides access to cable channels and CD-quality music. The system 's dish antenna is only 18 inches across, so it is relatively inconspicuous when installed. The basic system costs $699 ; there are monthly and pay-per-view service charges. Surveying Made Simple Measuring inclines and leveling areas have always been tricky jobs best left for professionals ; now Stanley Tools ' Compulevel makes them easy. Place the base unit at one end of the work site, then unreel the cord to the other end. Press a button, and the tool displays the elevation change. The technology should find its way to other applications that require measuring differences in height. Available by year 's end, Compulevel should cost about $700. The Everything Machine Compaq 's Presario 520 CD-TV is an **31;467;TOOLONG multimedia computer in a uniquely elegant package. The Presario includes a computer, 14-inch display, cable-ready TV tuner, answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio CDs. For rich images and sound, the system supports 256 colors and has a double-speed CD-ROM drive and 16-bit stereo sound card. The TV tuner has jacks for a VCR or video-game system. Price : $1,899. Magic Mirror Display A new technology promises brighter and larger TV pictures than ever before. While normal TVs rely on cathode-ray tubes, Texas Instruments ' experimental Digital Micromirror Display creates an image by mechanically moving thousands of tiny mirrors suspended above a silicon chip. Light of any brightness can then be reflected off the mirrors to generate magazine-quality color on screens the size of a living-room wall. Coming Soon To A Runway Near You The next-generation Boeing 777 airliner took flight in June with the most powerful jet engines ever made. With 80,000 pounds of thrust, the giant twin engines make the plane more fuel-efficient than a three- or four-engine aircraft but are as quiet as the smaller engines on a 767. With a wider body than any jetliner except the Boeing 747, the 777 can carry as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game show on TV one thing, but actually participating in the show is quite another. With Twisted, a simulated TV game show, you control realistic-looking on-screen contestants : The CD-based game, from Electronic Arts for 3DO machines, lets up to four people play a zany game show complete with video puzzles, sound effects, and trivia. Twisted costs about $60. Versatile Minivan Removing the rear seat from a minivan when you want to carry cargo can be a nuisance. Odyssey, Honda 's new Accord-based minivan, offers a superb solution : a rear seat that folds into the floor. Odyssey also looks and handles a lot like a station wagon : It 's closer to the ground than other minivans and is equipped with four hinged doors. It shares the Accord 's 2.2-liter 16-valve powerplant and should retail for about $23,000. Go-Anywhere Data Merge the simplicity of pagers with the power of computers, and you get the Nationwide Wireless Network, a cord-free data-communications network being constructed by Mtel. Microsoft is lending software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Due to operate in 300 cities next year, the network will deploy an army of receiving stations so the two-way communicators can be small, low-power devices that last a month on batteries and do n't need antennas. Smart Walls Developed at the University of Dayton, experimental phase-change wallboard will not just keep the elements out -- it will also help control climate within a house. Tiny beads of paraffin embedded in the wallboard change phases, from liquid to solid, at a specific temperature. So when room air exceeds or drops below that level, the wallboard absorbs or releases heat to keep rooms comfortable. The wallboard could save up to 20 percent of house space-conditioning costs. Grand Award Automotive Technology Aluminum Audi The Audi A8 represents one of the few truly innovative efforts to combine a body structure and manufacturing process that maximize aluminum 's benefits. The result is a lightweight, extremely strong luxury car that gains in all areas. The manufacturing plant, developed by Audi and Alcoa Aluminum, also breaks new ground with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that makes aluminum practical for extensive use in future cars. The A8 is available in Europe. Silver Shooter The palm-size Pentax UC-1 might qualify as a spy camera -- if not for its flashy silver reflective coating. The camera can focus as close as 12 inches ; even at that distance, an auto parallax adjustment system yields a perfect image of the actual picture in the viewfinder -- no more lopped off heads. Other features : a precise 259-step autofocusing system, remote control, and auto flash. Price : $245 list. Six Sides : Better Than Round In the staid realm of washing machines, Staber Industries ' System 2000 makes waves by saving water two ways : Its wash basket is flipped on its side, so clothes slosh through a relatively small amount of water. And the wash basket and tub are hexagonal ; the flat sides paddle water through the perforations with more force. System 2000 halves the water used by conventional machines and saves detergent too. Cost : $800 to $900. Ocean Explorer Cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odyssey II proved itself in two tests this year : It studied crack formation beneath the Arctic ice off the coast of Alaska in March, and then dove to the site of an underwater eruption off the coast of Washington in August. Odyssey II will help scientists gather oceanographic data, monitor fish stocks, and inspect pipelines. Stylish Minivan By adapting elements of a front-drive passenger car platform to a spacious people-carrier, the Ford Windstar establishes new ride and handling benchmarks for minivans with the traction and space efficiencies of front-wheel drive and fully independent suspension. An innovative feature that enhances seating flexibility is the sliding rear seat, which moves forward to create more cargo room without requiring removal. Price starts at $19,455. Goodbye, Glint Reflections from eyeglasses, binoculars, rifle scopes, and other optical devices can be fatal if they betray a soldier 's position. The killFlash shield developed by Tenebraex Corp. could protect soldiers by suppressing glint with a honeycomb grid that fits over lenses. Anti-glint shields could also be used in automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shields would make them look like part of the car body. Electronic Navigator The Guidestar navigation system developed by Zexel, USA, and refined by Oldsmobile represents a trend likely to be emulated by other car makers. The $2,000 option on the Olds 88 uses a GPS-based guidance system to locate the car, then refers to digitally stored maps to plot a path to your destination. As similar guidance systems catch on, you may never get lost again. NO sub X Stopper More than half of the electricity in the United States is generated with coal. Now, technology from Asea Brown Boveri burns powderized coal more cleanly by as much as a factor of seven. Using carefully controlled amounts of combustion air, the TFS 2000 industrial-furnace design cuts oxides of nitrogen( NO sub x) emissions from a conventional 500 to 1,000 parts per million to 150. Next year, the technology will be used in a 245-megawatt steam generator in Virginia. Eyes-On Camera The ultimate dream machine would obey your thoughts. That remains mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movieboy E1, which features functions that respond to eye movement. Using technology adapted from Canon 's EOS still camera, Movieboy lets you operate, for example, zooming and playback by focusing your eyes on commands or icons. Priced at about $2,000, the camcorder is available now in Japan ; U.S. sales are planned for 1995. Grand Award Cars Roomy Compacts Clouds lent their names to Chrysler Corp. ' s aggressively sculpted compact sedans, the Dodge Stratus( top) and Chrysler Cirrus. Well-equipped with a standard V6 engine and showing adept road manners, the roomy Cirrus( $17,970 base price) provides a spacious interior bedecked with luxury features. Its Dodge Stratus sister car( available next February) adds two four-cylinder engine choices and a five-speed manual transmission. These fresh Chrysler products are further evidence of new thinking in Michigan. Double-Duty VCR With Go-Video 's GV 8050 VCR, copying the videotapes you took with your 8mm or High-B camcorder to the VHS format is as easy as pushing a button. This dual-deck, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assembly editing, where you can put together scenes from as many as eight different sources. Using the $1,099 VCR 's external computer port and additional editing software, you can do even more complex editing. Heart Alarms A new blood test developed at Baylor College of Medicine takes the time-consuming uncertainty out of diagnosing possible heart-attack victims. While a standard blood-enzyme test requires 12 to 14 hours, the Baylor test yields a result in two hours or less. Now used at 70 hospitals, the $40 test could save up to $4 billion a year and cut coronary-care-unit admissions by 70 percent. Oh, My Darling Clementine, the first U.S. craft to visit the moon in a quarter-century, is proof that NASA 's " smaller, faster, cheaper " mantra is more than just rhetoric. The 500-pound spacecraft was designed and built in only two years, for just $80 million. Jointly developed by NASA and the Pentagon, Clementine could be model for future military-civilian cooperation. Like its namesake, though, Clementine is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth more than one million images of the lunar surface. The Fix Is In Even products like inexpensive hair dryers and electric razors soon could be practical to repair, thanks to new industrial software called Design for Service. The software from Boothroyd Dewhurst uses lists of questions and suggestions( photo) to help industrial designers consider ease of repair when creating new products. Xerox is among the software 's purchasers, and Ford plans to use the industrial software to design two 1999-model cars. World Cars Designed without compromise, the Ford Contour( left) and Mercury Mystique stand in the vanguard of automotive engineering. With every important component given a ground-up redesign -- including a new chassis, two engine options, transmission, and even new steering gear -- the cars incorporate innovative basic engineering and sophisticated electronic control systems. The extensive achievement should influence products from Ford and other makers for years to come. Base price : $13,310. Sophisticated Off-Roader Ford 's Explorer advances the concept of a rugged, versatile sport utility with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The system is semiautomatic, running in two-wheel drive until tire slip is detected, then transferring power to all four wheels. The 1995 Explorer also incorporates new safety features, including four-wheel disc brakes and dual air bags. Base price should be about $27,000. Tech Toilet The most sophisticated water-stingy commode among today 's low-flush models is the Fluidizer from Control Fluidics. The unit combines a pressurized rinse with a blenderlike system that renders all solid material liquid -- so less water is needed to transport the wastes to sewage systems. Indeed, the Fluidizer consumes just 2.3 quarts per flush, while standard low-flush toilets use nearly three times that amount. Walk-Through Windows The GDL Cabrio Balcony Roof Window from Velux is the first to transform from a roof window into a step-out balcony with the flip of a latch. Designed to conform to roof pitches from 35 to 53 degrees, Cabrio can be built into roofs of almost any material. The units measure 100 by 27 inches, and the panes are insulated with energy-efficient argon glass fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology Solar-Powered Resort It does n't look like much, but that 's the idea. The world 's first solar-powered luxury resort, Harmony was intended to blend into its pristine surroundings inside the U.S. Virgin Islands National Park on St. John. Harmony 's eight cottages -- there 'll be 32 eventually -- were designed to fit among existing trees. Each cottage is constructed almost entirely from recycled materials, and there are interactive computer programs to teach visitors about Harmony 's various environmental and alternative-energy features. Genuine Jaguar The 1995 XJR sedan reprises the graceful lines of classic Jaguars, updated with state-of-the-art underpinnings. The supercharged four-liter in-line six features a unique air-coolant-air intercooler and develops 322 hp at 5,000 rpm and 378 foot-pounds of torque at 3,050 rpm. All-speed traction control, antilock brakes, dual air bags, and improved ergonomics inside add up to the most civilized cat ever. A wood-rimmed steering wheel adds a retro touch. Base price : $65,000. Cheap Heat To boost building-heating efficiency, the elegantly simple perforated aluminum panel called Solarwall pre-warms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbs as much as 80 percent of the available solar energy -- a record for solar air collectors. Developed by researchers at Conserval and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the panel sells for $10 per foot and could pay for itself in energy savings in as little as three years. Smaller Is Better Anyone who has wielded a poorly balanced hand tool knows that bigger is not necessarily better. About 15 percent smaller than its competitors, Panasonic 's Predator line of cordless drills/drivers sets impressive standards for utility and function. Top-of-the-line models sport a 12-volt battery that recharges in 15 minutes( photo). The motor is variable-speed, reversible, and has 21 torque settings for driving screws. Price range : $199 to $229. Bookshelf Video-CD System The first video CD mini component system, model SC-VC1O from Panasonic plays up to 74 minutes of full-motion videos from five-inch discs using the MPEG-1 digital video-decompression standard with the addition of a TV set. The unit also plays audio CDs and CD + Graphics( karaoke) titles. Sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available in the United States this fall under the Technics label. T-Bone Protection A regular air bag does little good if your car gets T-boned from the side. First to bring a side-impact bag to market, Swedish designers cleverly located the device in the side of the 1995 Volvo 850 's seat side holster -- rather than on a door panel. That means the air bag is always correctly positioned to protect the driver and front-seat passenger, regardless of seat adjustment. A $500 option on 1995 Volvo 850 models, the air bag is standard on 850 Turbo models. Bravo For Brakes Too timid to try in-line skating? Never fear : Automatic Braking Technology( ABT) from Rollerblade now enables anyone to stop with ease and confidence. When you put one foot in front of the other to stop, an arm pushes the brake downward against the ground. Because the wheels do n't have to leave the ground while braking, you maintain balance. ABT is available on the new Bravoblade series and on two older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detector After long delays, the first national radar network designed to detect severe thunderstorms and tornadoes is now mostly in place -- and it 's exceeding expectations. Nexrad, as the Next Generation Weather Radar is called, relies on high-resolution Doppler radar and modern computer graphics to spot and report the swirling winds indicative of violent storms. Nexrad has doubled average warning times for tornadoes and flash floods and halved the false-alarm rate for all storms. It 's A Gas Homeowners who live in areas where electricity prices are high have a new heating-and-cooling alternative : York International 's Triathalon, the first residential-size gas-engine-driven heat pump sold in this country. Heat pumps are devices that provide heating and cooling in one unit. Because Triathalon reuses warmth produced by the motor, it heats 40 percent more efficiently than the top-performing furnace ; it also cools as efficiently as a dedicated electric air conditioner. Grand Award Home Technology Microwaves : From Popcorn to Pants Its microwave-oven-style door is the tipoff : This is no ordinary clothes dryer. It uses microwaves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And because microwaves heat the water rather than warm the air( thus " baking " the clothes), the dryer is gentler on fabrics and can even handle silk and wool. Developed by the Electric Power Research Institute with AsTEX/Gerling Laboratories and Thermo Energy Corp., prototype microwave dryers are now being tested. Magic Pair Sony 's Magic Link and Motorola 's Envoy( shown) are the latest in handheld communicators.( Photo omitted) Each employs General Magic 's whimsical Magic Cap interface and " intelligent " Telescript communications system. Magic Link and Envoy both have a standard( corded) fax and data modem inside, and Envoy also includes a wireless radio-frequency modem for greater portability. Magic Link costs about $1,000. Envoy is expected to be available by year 's end for about $1,500. Matsushita( Panasonic) and Philips are also working on devices using General Magic software. Speedy Data Traveling Software 's SpeedSync blows through network-cable and phone-wire bottlenecks, dramatically increasing the speed of computer file transfers. By recognizing what changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes rather than the whole file -- boosting speeds by up to 800 percent, and saving time and long-distance charges. SpeedSync appears first in LapLink for Windows. Grip And Go Energy efficiency or high performance? It 's been a tradeoff for tire designers -- until now. Michelin 's XSE technology reduces rolling resistance by 35 percent and improves traction in wet conditions without skimping on other performance characteristics. A form of silica replaces the conventional carbon black as a strengthening rubber additive. The technology is implemented in five models including the MXV4( shown).( Photo omitted) Refined Ute With the GMC Jimmy and Chevrolet Blazer, General Motors elevates the design that started the compact-sport-utility craze to a new plateau. The Jimmy/Blazer( $22,438 base) handily executes the difficult hat trick for a sport utility : It blends a smooth ride and reasonable handling with substantial off-road capability. The key was in combining a serious reengineering of the Blazer 's suspension with careful tuning of tires and shock-absorber combinations. Space-Radar Lab Using powerful synthetic-aperture-radar imaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream beds beneath the Sahara Desert 's dunes and mapped the 5,000-year-old city of Ubar in Oman.( Sand dunes are at the bottom of the image at right, though the ancient city itself is not visible.)( Photo omitted) The first shuttle mission was conducted in April, and the second blasted off in September. Part of NASA 's Mission to Planet Earth, the Space Radar Laboratory has made measurements of snow packs, geologic features, and ocean wave heights at 19 ecologically sensitive sites, gathering detailed information on natural and human-caused changes. Computer, Take A Memo The first dictation product for Windows PCs, Voice for Windows brings Kurzweil 's accurate, large-vocabulary, speaker-independent voice-recognition system to today 's most popular software. The speaker-independence eliminates tedious voice " training " ; you can begin talking to your PC immediately. The system lets you do spot training as needed to improve accuracy. Voice for Windows includes a sound board and microphone and lists for $995. Minimalism, Italian-Style The Ducati 916 brings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road. Narrow and agile, the 438-pound sport bike has a compact fuel-injected twin-V engine that uses the Italian maker 's signature desmodromic valve-actuation system to produce 104 hp. The slightest inputs at the controls elicit a balance of acceleration, braking, and rock-steady cornering most cyclists only experience in daydreams. Price : $14,500. Green Light Because it consumes a scant 0.03 watts, you can praise Limelite for its energy efficiency. Or you can cheer that the night light has no bulb to shatter, or that the slim little light does n't generate enough heat to cause burns. Limelite uses a durable electroluminescent material to cast that soft, green glow. Developed by Austin Innovations, the device costs about $8. Grand Award Photography Flexible Compact The remarkable Contax G1 35mm camera has reengineered the staid interchangable-lens rangefinder category. The camera 's unique design incorporates an autofocus system to complement manual focusing, and a 1/2,000-second top-speed focal-plane shutter. The resulting titanium-clad electronically controlled camera combines the flexibility of a single-lens-reflex with the size and handiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available. Price of the G1 body : $1,790. Watts New Talk about impressive numbers : The $350 Lightning Charger produces 900 watts of 115-volt DC current, 55 amps for charging, and 80 amps of starting power. But it weighs just 16 pounds and measures less than one cubic foot. The secret : The generator 's neodymium iron boron magnets are ten times more powerful than ordinary ones. Now sold with a two-stroke powerplant, Lightning Charger is also available in a $450 version that generates 800 watts, or about eight amps of AC power. Master Mechanics Well-rehearsed teams of space-walking astronauts performed brilliantly for 11 days to correct the optics and replace flawed components of the Hubble Space Telescope. In a $630 million mission, the space shuttle Endeavour crew restored the $1.6 billion orbiting astronomy lab 's performance to within shooting distance of its original design. This year, breathtakingly sharpened images of distant galaxies and confirmation of a black hole 's existence are early fruits of the masterful rescue mission. High-Tech Racer The Patriot, Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a high-performance race car, demonstrates a new approach to advanced research. The car is powered by innovative technology, including a liquefied-natural-gas turbine, flywheel energy storage, and high-amperage electric drive. Building a car for international racing at LeMans imposes deadlines on getting the Patriot running and provides a venue that tests the vehicle in the crucible of competition. Top Quark Now there are six -- six quarks, that is. The top quark, avidly sought since 1977, has almost certainly been found in the energy fire storm at a Fermilab accelerator. Quarks are fundamental particles that comprise nuclear matter : protons and neutrons. The master concept by which physicists picture nature, called the Standard Model, demands that six kinds of quarks exist. Without the top, this view of the universe would crumble. Better Battery AER Energy 's Power 220 rechargeable battery pack is the first to use zinc-air technology, which offers roughly three times more energy per ounce than nickel-based cells -- and about one-and-a-half times more than the latest lithium-ion batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCs for 15 to 24 hours and also simultaneously power most handheld cellular phones.

A planned optional adapter and software will let Flashback 's PCMCIA-compatible interface download recordings to a PC. List price for Flashback, which comes with one 30-minute cartridge : $250. Have It Your Way Many luxury cars have memory settings for seat and mirror positions, but the new Lincoln Continental takes that convenience to the next level : Touch a button, and the car automatically adjusts a dozen different settings to your personal preferences. For example, you can program for a low, normal, or high steering effort. The car remembers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set. Dream Laser An affordable laser printer that produces brilliant color pictures to complement its ability to print razor-sharp text has long been a fantasy for millions of PC users. Now, Hewlett-Packard makes that dream a reality with the Color LaserJet, at a list price of $7,295. The breakthrough one-pass, direct-to-drum imaging process renders true-color output at reasonable speeds and affordable prices -- typically six to 30 cents per page. Grand Award Science &; Technology Other Worlds For the first time, a planetary system has been found orbiting a star other than the sun. Alexander Wolszczan, a Pennsylvania State University astronomer, used the giant radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to observe puzzling variations in the radio waves emitted by a spinning pulsar, a star 1,500 light-years away. His conclusion, now widely accepted, is that " irrefutable evidence " proves the existence of at least three planets around the star.

More, More -- And Less The car that set new standards for luxury sedans five years ago has raised the stakes. The 1995 Lexus LS 400( $51,200 base) has more power, more head and leg room, and less weight than the model it replaces. Add to that stately new body lines and a zero-to-60 time of less than seven seconds, and you have a vehicle that will no doubt frighten European luxury-car makers -- again. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light, researchers at Lockheed Missiles &; Space Co. have discovered a way to reduce the cost of camera, microscope, and telescope lenses dramatically. The first product incorporating the technology is a liquid-lens assembly for a 5.5-inch f/10 refractor telescope. Made by Epoch Instruments, the $2,500 lens assembly is comparable with $4,000 assemblies made from solid materials. Gas Ranges Clean Up Though favored by chefs, gas ranges have had drawbacks : They release combustion by-products( including carbon monoxide), as well as natural gas when a low flame or pilot light blows out. Now the Canadian Gas Research Institute has developed the first gas range with a ceramic cooktop and sealed combustion chamber. A fan draws fresh air from outside into the chamber, then expels combustion by-products. The Institute is working with manufacturers to market the range. Digital Soldier The first digital uniform promises the 21st-century soldier an array of unprecedented capabilities : With a GPS receiver, he 'll be able to pinpoint his exact location at all times. With wireless digital communications, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with infrared sensors displaying information directly in his eyepiece, he 'll spot the enemy before the enemy sees him.

A Classic Overachiever The rear-engine air-cooled Porsche 911 is a classic design that nearly defies improvement -- but the 1994 911 nevertheless reaches new heights. A new rear suspension is both compliant and predictable -- a high achievement for any rear-engine car -- while the body is smoothed and modernized. An aggressive, flat-out sports car, Porsche has survived the passage of time to become even better. Base price : $59,995. Bona Fide Black Hole Black holes have been part of space lore for decades. But their existence was unproven until this year, when a research team used images from the improved Hubble Space Telescope to spot a black hole in the Virgo constellation. The scientists measured the speed of a gas disk( right) rotating around an unseen object, and determined that only a black hole could have sufficient mass to keep the gases spinning at such a high rate. Flight Without Fuel Pathfinder, an unpiloted all-wing prototype aircraft 100 feet in span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying solely on electricity from its photo-voltaic cells. Developed by Paul MacCready 's AeroVironment **28;500;TOOLONG company, the solar drone will find uses in aerial surveillance, environmental monitoring, and as a communications relay. Adding a fuel-cell energy-storage system should permit Pathfinder 's 200-foot successor to fly for months at a time in the rare air that exists above 60,000 feet. 3-D CD CD-ROMs usually store data as a layer of tiny bumps and grooves burned onto a carbon disc. But why be limited to making use of only two dimensions? IBM researchers increase data capacity by a factor of ten with an experimental " multilayer CD " consisting of stacked translucent discs. To read the CD, a laser with a movable lens simply focuses on the appropriate layer. This technology could soon store entire feature-length movies on one CD.
