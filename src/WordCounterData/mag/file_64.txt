2007941 ROBERT GOTTLIEB on the transformative power of a good read. // Books can change your life in different ways. Some touch a deep chord ; some educate you ; some lead you down new paths ; some just make you happy. When I was nine or ten I was led to the books of Arthur Ransome, which, beginning with Swallows and Amazons, of 1930, have charmed and thrilled generations of English and American school-children.( They 're still in print.) I had already gone through Albert Paysoii Terhune, of Lad : A Dog fame, but, although on the whole I preferred clogs to children in real life, Terhune was n't a very convincing writer. Ransome 's stories of the boys and girls who sailed the little Swallow and Amazon in England 's Lake District were satisfying in every way. I did n't so much care about their actual adventures as about their realistic yet ideal friendships, their brilliantly individualized characters : responsible Captain John, practical Mate Susan, daring Nancy of the Amazon( with its audacious pirate flag) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be. I read the twelve Ransome novels dozens-scores-of times. Today I realize they were less books that changed my life than books that were my life. At sixteen, I found Jane Austen 's Emma( known to a new generation as the inspiration for Clueless). It was clearly a great novel, one of the first I had encountered, but what struck me then with particular force was not its overall quality but the famous picnic scene in which Emma - pretty, petted, spoiled, yet largehearted and generous-indulges her thoughtless wit at the expense of the kind but garrulous Miss Bates, shocking the other guests and earning a reprimand from the person she most admires( and eventually marries), Mr. Knightley. Instantly I saw in myself a reflection of Emma 's deficient character. I 've never come closer to blushing. That was the moment I realized I had better take myself in hand if I wanted to become a person I did n't have to be ashamed of. The book that changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961, having been in publishing for half a dozen years. Both the book and the abandoned enthusiasm with which we published it at Simon &; Schuster were spectacularly visible, jump-starting my career. Other successes( let 's not talk about the flops) were to follow, but for decades-and eventually to my irritation-I was publicly identified as " the editor of Catch-22. " In the more than forty years that have gone by, I 've never reread it ; I think I 've been scared that I would n't love it now as much as I did then. People tell me I do n't have to worry. In 1969, when I began working with Lincoln Kirstein, the great cultural impresario of our time, the man who brought George Balanchine to America, on a book about the New York City Ballet, I was unknowingly opening a door to the ballet world for myself. Lincoln co-opted me for City Ballet( I had been a passionate adherent since its first season, in 1948) and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company, from programming the season to negotiating with the musicians ' union( nobody asked me to dance). The book, called NewYork City Ballet, was the crucial gateway to this central part of my life. But beyond that, in Kirstein 's account of the many ways he contributed to New York 's cultural life-he was instrumental in founding the Museum of Modern Art and building Lincoln Center-I discovered the closest thing I 've ever had to a role model. No wonder that one day, after a meeting at the ballet, I heard myself singing, " In my head I was thinkin ' I could be another Lincoln if I only had a brain. " And another, very different, world was opened to me when I worked for five years with Katharine Graham, editing her wonderful autobiography, Personal History. I had known nothing of Washington life ; then-becoming close to Kay, frequently staying in her famous R Street house-I found myself in the yolk of the Washington egg. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And her book, published at the end of her long, rich life and confounding expectations with its frankness and fluency, was n't just a revelation of Washington ; it was a lesson for me-as it proved to be for so many others, young and old-in how you can( and must) reinvent yourself when life demands it of you.

He is also the dance critic for the New York Observer. // <p>
