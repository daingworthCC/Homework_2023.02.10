2025841 Section : pastel page <p> For Long Island, New York, artist Jeff Webb, pastel was an inadvertent discovery. Years ago, while studying with painter Henry Hensche in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Webb ran out of funds. A fellow artist suggested he do portraits on the street to earn money, but to do this, he needed to get a permit from the town. Webb approached the local powers-that-be, where he was asked, for some reason, if he worked in pastels. Webb did n't know why he had been asked this question, but without hesitation he answered affirmatively, hurried off to buy a box of pastels, and began practicing doing portraits of as many people as he could find to sit still. Soon, he was given a spot on the street and started making money. But it was n't until he began studying the translucent work of another street artist that he realized pastel 's potential. " All of a sudden, pastels became very alive for me, " he recalls. <p> This translucent quality still excites Webb, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traditional oil-painting technique -- making an underpainting in complementary colors. For instance, if he is painting a figure with a peach complexion, he will underpaint the skin in three values of its complement, blue. " Both colors are intense and work together to produce a muted color that is beautifully translucent, " he explains. Webb continually adjusts his colors, crosshatching and layering one over another until they melt into the right hue. He does this over every area of his paintings, even the background and small details. This procedure enhances the translucent effect by creating visual color mixtures. " I 'm constantly walking a tightrope to get the color I 'm after, " he says of the process. He goes on to compare it to cooking a stew : " You add spices until it tastes right and hope you have n't gone too far. " <p> Over the years, Webb has developed palettes for depicting various skin tones. For instance, to paint a figure with suntanned skin, he underpaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it with an orange-red. Next, he applies a magenta pink across the cheeks and uses violet or caput mortuum( which is similar to Mars violet) in the darker areas of the face. To create highlights, he uses a light alizarin crimson. If the color becomes too hot, he subdues it with a light, whitish viridian. <p> With an olive-skinned model, he makes an underpainting in a dark, cool green for the shadow areas and a warm green for the medium tones and highlights. Over this, he cross-hatches vermilion or an orange-red, allowing the greens to show through. If the red is too hot, he cools it down with a red violet. For a figure with pale, white skin, he underpaints it in blue. Over this, he then applies a light peach and, perhaps, some light cerulean blue or light vermilion. For brown skin, the artist uses a three-value underpainting of either blue, violet, or green over which he meshes their complements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over purple). <p> Webb claims he uses as many as two dozen different colors to create certain flesh tones. However, if he knows the model 's coloring before-hand, he may arrive at a sitting with as few as a dozen pastels : dark brown, sandalwood( a medium tone for light skin), or burnt sienna( a medium tone for brown skin), high-light colors, and grays and black for the background. <p> Webb finds creating translucent-looking hair of various colors equally challenging. In depicting blond hair, he underpaints with a lot of olive green, which he then subdues with a light dusting of burnt sienna or red iron oxide. Next, he switches to a light yellow ochre. " The inclination is to make the hair too yellow, " he says. " Blond hair consists mainly of browns, with some silvers and grays. I only add yellow highlights judiciously. " For dark-brown hair, he underpaints with blues and indigos, to which he adds burnt sienna. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture. <p> For black hair, he uses indigo or black for the underpainting and for the highlights violet, brown, or blue. Silver highlights, he warns, can make the hair look gray. " The tendency with red hair, " he cautions, " is to make it the color of Ronald McDonald 's. Keep it subdued and focus on the red highlights. And for for auburn hair, an underpainting in green and violet helps to keep the color down. " At times, Webb will lightly stroke the dominant color over an area and then add touches of the same color in other sections to unify the painting. <p> For his method to be effective, Webb emphasizes, the underpainting and the subsequent layers of pastel must be of equal intensity. And he carefully points out, he never reverts to using the local color of the skin or hair. He also warns against smudging or blending colors, which often results in dead hues. " But, " he emphasizes, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors can be beautiful and necessary. They are like pauses in music. When I deliberately want to create quiet passages, I use dead colors, such as black or charcoal gray, which absorb light rather than reflect it. They do n't create vibrancy, but they fill space. " <p> Webb has equally strong words of caution about backgrounds : " Putting them in last can cause a disaster, " he warns. " You must work on the background from the beginning. And when you 're painting it, imagine that it 's a wall of subdued colors, not just some puffy clouds. Use the background to accentuate various parts of the figure by creating contrast. For instance, make the lightest area of a figure the focal point by setting it up against a dark background. " <p> Looking at the paintings that hang in Webb 's studio, it 's easy to figure out what his favorite subject matter is : people -- " something involving human figures in an environment with a challenging composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says. The eclectic mix of antique and utilitarian furniture, as well as the Oriental rugs, that fill his studio often appear in his interior figure studies ; he points out one chair -- " my favorite portrait chair, " he calls it. " I also like to play with geometric shapes next to organic shapes, " he explains " and I like odd and extreme perspective. I make tons of thumbnail sketches, so the composition is pretty much worked out before the model arrives. When I 'm doing portraits, I focus on the character of the model. Otherwise, I use the figure as an interesting shape or form that fits into the painting. " <p> These days, Webb says, in order to produce something good, he has to like his model. " More of the model 's individuality is creeping into my work, " he says. " When choosing one, I look for an interesting character, and, because I 'm a social person and like to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging personality. When a model is posing for me, I prefer he or she take a comfortable pose rather than one that is graceful. <p> " Many of my paintings include a narrative that has symbolic elements in it, " he adds. " Often, they reflect my interest in history. I also like what I call anticipatory paintings, ' works that capture a moment in which something is about to happen, such as Honey, I 'm Home, " he says. " The presence of light in the work is meaningful to me in a spiritual sense ; I prefer to have natural light coming in from somewhere. " <p> Webb has had extensive training in painting the human figure. He studied with the Russian artist Claudia Wiasigina, who was a student of the famous Russian portrait painter Valentin Serov( 1865-1911). Madame Wiasigina, as she insisted upon being called, put the young Webb in a room with a skeleton and told him he had to draw it from every angle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from a live model. Despite the fact that Madame Wiasigina was a hard taskmaster, Webb notes that she became very dear to him. Also, her influence stayed with him ; when he was an undergraduate art student, he completed three semesters of dissection work in a program at Columbia University 's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. <p> Although his students do n't have the same technical training, Webb encourages them to work in the same manner he does -- without detailed preliminary drawings of the figures. He suggests they begin with loose sketches and gestural drawings. " Students should n't get hooked into the coloring-book school of art, " he warns. " If the preliminary drawing is too successful and beautiful, the idea of painting over it will be intimidating. You 'll be afraid to ruin it, and you 'll end up with a colored drawing. " Instead, he tells them to block in the basic forms and large masses first and then deal with the features. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says, and, likening this process to geography, he adds, " Paint the land masses, not the borders. " He encourages his students to study drawing and painting simultaneously because, he notes, " a knowledge of graphics is necessary to painting -- although you ca n't rely on drawing skills and technique alone to create a successful work. " <p> Not surprisingly, Webb gives as careful consideration to his equipment as he does to his techniques and subject matter. His studio is dominated by a large crank easel, which he designed and built to fit low-ceilinged rooms. Next to it is a small metal patio table that Webb finds perfect for resting his pastels on. They wo n't roll off, and they wo n't sit in their own dust because it falls through the small holes in the table onto a drop cloth on the floor. He keeps his pastels in specially designed trays that fit into an easel box. Each tray has six large sections in which colors are arranged according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is using at the moment. The bottom of the trays have wire screens, which makes cleaning them a simple matter of running a feather duster over the top and then vacuuming the dust from below. <p> Webb has no one favorite paper, but he calls Canson Mi-Teintes his " meat-and-potatoes paper. " He also likes Sennelier 's La Carte pastel board, but he does point out that using water on it for an underpainting, as some pastelists do, dissolves the paper 's textured surface. For quick sketches, he prefers St. Armand Paper Mill 's Sabretooth pastel paper. Additionally, he works on pastel cloth, sanded canvas, Windberg 's sanded pastel paper, and watercolor paper. He often paints a wash of watercolor paint on the watercolor paper to give it more tooth. At times, he makes his own sanded board using four-ply rag-board primed with acrylic gesso mixed with acrylic color( usually gray) to tone the ground and FF grade pumice powder for texture. If he 's using a flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like many pastelists, Webb begins working with hard pastels. His preferred brand is Yarka, especially the company 's Sauce box set of browns and grays, which he refers to as " a great drawing tool. " He tries to stay with the hard pastels as long as possible before turning to the softer ones -- Sennelier, Schmincke, and Rowney. For toning down colors, he finds vine charcoal works well. <p> " I buy any very dark color available, " he says. " I particularly like the brownish and reddish blacks from Sennelier. But I try not to buy many of the light, so-called pastel ' colors. Unfortunately, most sets come with lots of them. By adding too much white to a color, you decrease its intensity and lose the sparkle. A painting with too many lights will look meager. I prefer high-contrast colors and reserve the pale hues for accents. To get the effect of sunlight, everything else must be kept deep and dark for contrast because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight. <p> " When blocking in a painting, " he adds, " keep in mind that all pastels are water-soluble and will become more so if a few drops of alcohol -- rubbing, denatured, or even gin -- are added to the water. Brush over the pastel with a bristle brush dipped in water and create a solid underpainting without filling up too much of the paper 's tooth. This process works nicely with Canson Mi-Teintes paper, provided it is stretched and tacked to a board first. If the paper does buckle, spray the back lightly with water and restaple it to the board. The painting will dry as tight as a drum. " <p> Jeff Webb brings his talent, vast knowledge, and tremendous enthusiasm to the classes he teaches at Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York, and the Art League of Long Island( formerly the Huntington Town Art League). Among the courses he teaches are traditional oil painting, drawing, art history, two-dimensional design, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn, New York, and two MA. degrees( one in art history and one in painting and drawing) from C. W. Post College in Greenvale, New York. A founding member of the Pastel Society of America, he has been named one of its Master Pastelists. He is represented by The Loring Gallery in Sheffield, Massachusetts. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Above, left : Self-portrait, 1992, pastel, 24 x 18.
