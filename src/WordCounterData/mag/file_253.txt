2030641 Section : NUTRITION You Know what your diet needs right now? Hint : It 's on this list <p> WHAT IN THE WORLD IS WRONG WITH YOU? <p> What 's missing from your life? You 've got your karma and you 've got your chi. But you 're still feeling so lousy that you joined Oprah 's book club. <p> Maybe it 's time to try looking for your missing nutrient -- copper, folio acid, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, omega-3 fatty acids, or zinc. If one of these is absent from your diet -- and chances are one is -- you 'll get sick, you 'll get sore, and you 'll get stupid. <p> Once you know what 's missing, where are you going to look? Forget journaling and meditating. Try shopping. Here 's your list. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Runny nose, coughing, fever WHAT MAY BE MISSING : COPPER <p> Who says it is n't a precious metal? When University of North Carolina at Greensboro researchers infected human cells with bacteria, they found that the cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria than did cells with low copper levels. They also produced up to 60 percent more cytokines -- chemicals that trigger the body 's immune response. " The fact that these were otherwise healthy cells shows just how sensitive our immune system is to a lack of copper, " notes Mark Failla, Ph.D., the study author. <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In your breakfast. One bowl of raisin bran, a slice of buttered whole wheat toast, and a cup of hot chocolate will give you more than a third of what you need each day. Copper has also been spotted in lobster, cashews, and salmon. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Huffing and puffing, even without a cigarette ; lack of stamina during aerobic exercise WHAT MAY BE MISSING : ZINC <p> Zinc is the fitness mineral for men. A USDA study recently found that men on a low-zinc diet had a 40 percent decrease in red-blood-cell activity. " The longer it takes red blood cells to transfer carbon dioxide to your lungs, the harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D., the study author. Plus, without enough zinc, your body ca n't clear the lactic acid out of your muscles, and that makes them heavy, very heavy. In fact, simply trying to get out of your own way will send your heart racing and make your breathing labored. <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In a lean hamburger on a whole wheat bun ; it has three times the zinc of that chicken sandwich you think is a healthier choice. You 'll also find zinc in baked beans, peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, and scrambled eggs. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Headaches, sleepless nights WHAT MAY BE MISSING : MAGNESIUM <p> Think of magnesium as your body 's bouncer ; without enough of it, uninvited calcium will rush into your cells and wreak havoc on key hormones and neurotransmitters. After a little while, blood vessels become constricted and your head starts hurting, says Burton M. Altura, Ph.D., professor of physiology and pharmacology at the State University of New York at Brooklyn. " Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it difficult for you to fall asleep. " <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In a baked potato topped with broccoli and a slice of melted cheese, plus a glass of milk. Magnesium is also found in almonds, frozen fish fillets, bananas, and whole grain breads and cereals. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Brittle bones, frequent stress fractures, teeth that crack when opening beer bottles WHAT MAY BE MISSING : PHOSPHOROUS <p> You 'd think that guzzling calcium-fortified orange juice would buy you a set of unbreakable bones. We used to think that, too. But it turns out that adding extra calcium to your diet without an equal amount of phosphorus will actually increase the odds that sticks, stones, and just about anything else will break your bones. " Extra calcium can make the composition of the bones unbalanced, " says Joseph Spence, Ph.D., director of the USDA 's Human Nutrition Research Center. " Your body will continue to build bone, but without enough phosphorus, the composition will be fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian-bacon-and-egg sandwich on a whole wheat English muffin. This modified McMuffin has 348 milligrams of phosphorus, exactly what you need to balance the 350 milligrams of calcium in a glass of fortified orange juice. You can also find phosphorus in pizza, macaroni and cheese, and chicken vegetable soup. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Constantly sore muscles, aching joints, difficulty picking up gym bag without a spotter WHAT MAY BE MISSING : OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS <p> If you 've stopped trying to show off by bench-pressing the stairclimber and you still feel sore all the time, you may need more omega-3s in your diet. Researchers from down under recently found that men who ate the most omega-3 fatty acids had 26 percent lower levels of prostaglandins -- fatty acids that cause muscle soreness. Taking in more omega-3s can counterbalance prostaglandin production and may decrease recovery time and diminish muscle pain, says William Lands, Ph.D., a senior science advisor at the National Institutes of Health. <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In pizza with anchovies. A shrimp cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whole wheat bread is also high in omega-3s. YOUR SYMPTOMS : You 're getting dumber, you ca n't concentrate, and you laugh at your own stupid jokes. WHAT MAY BE MISSING : IRON <p> That 's right, iron, a.k.a. kryptonite to men. Studies have linked high levels of iron, in excess of 10 milligrams a day, to an increased risk of heart disease in men. But if you 're too good about watching your iron intake and you 're on a low-fat diet that 's light on meat, you could be coming up short. Without enough iron, your body has trouble ferrying oxygen through your bloodstream and dropping it off where you need it most : your brain. " When oxygen is n't reaching the brain, you feel light-headed and tired. Cognitive performance can suffer, too, " says Gary Miller, Ph.D., a professor of health at Wake Forest University. <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In a Caesar salad. Just make sure it 's a big bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon juice. Eating foods high in vitamin C, like lemons, along with an iron-rich meal improves your body 's absorption of the mineral, says Miller. Iron also turns up in lean beef, dried fruit, and raisin bran. YOUR SYMPTOMS : Forgetfulness. For example, you forgot you read this already. This, too. WHAT MAY BE MISSING : FOLIC ACID <p>... and your keys. Sure, there are a lot of reasons your memory could be going, but why not eliminate the easiest one first?( Okay, the second easiest if you 're Woody Harrelson.) According to a recent Swedish study, those people who bombed on a series of memory tests also had the lowest blood levels of folic acid. Researchers speculate that a shortage of folic acid may cause a spike in levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that damages blood vessels in the heart and the brain. <p> WHERE TO FIND IT : In a bowl of three-bean chili. One serving contains more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also present in orange juice, corn on the cob, and guacamole. SO WHY DO N'T I JUST TAKE A MULTIVITAMIN? <p> We thought you 'd ask that. Sure, taking a multivitamin is an option ; it 's just not the best option. Not every multi has these nutrients or has them in adequate or safe amounts. You 're also missing out on a ton of phytochemicals, plant compounds that have health benefits like helping to prevent cancer and lowering your risk of heart disease. <p> Downing a handful of individual supplements is no answer, either. " Separating nutrients into individual supplements such that they ca n't interact with other nutrients is n't as effective as eating food, " says Gary Miller, Ph.D., a professor of health at Wake Forest University. Besides, food tastes better. <p> By Katrin McDonald <p>
