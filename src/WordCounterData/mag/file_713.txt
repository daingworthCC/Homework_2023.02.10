4154541 testaments # Life is what happens when the apocalypse is late # Many of us do n't trouble ourselves with the end of the world. Frankly, we do n't have time for that right now. We 're more likely to concern ourselves with the end of the year--or the end of the credit card billing cycle, in this most expensive of seasons. In the deep midwinter, nights are longer and hope seems to grow thinner. We may have friends who are sick, or relatives coming to the end of life and preparing to make the leap into eternity. We may be fixing to make that leap ourselves. # These kinds of mortal limits engage our attention. They are immediate, tangible, and unavoidable. Apocalypse, by contrast, is a faraway celestial snag that can not compel us to lift a weighty pair of theological binoculars with which to contemplate it. # Should we care about the world 's end? At the close of every church year and the start of each new one, the end-times are re-presented as an urgent matter. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apocalypse every now and then. Prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel, and Daniel promoted serious attention to divine judgment for the actions of human history. Nearly every other prophet warns of " the Day of the Lord " when God 's friends are rescued, God 's enemies punished, and all that is wrong with the world made right. # Jesus preached apocalypse and final judgment. So did Paul and the majority of the New Testament writers. A brief glance around at our present global chaos can make the end of it all a rather comforting notion. Should n't we be longing, praying even, for the Lord to stop delaying and start making like a burglar, sneaking into time and stealing away human history 's terrible options at last? # We do n't pray for this, because at our core we really do n't want to see it end. Some of those human options happen to be ours. We who enjoy the freedom of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow do n't fancy giving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness. Never mind that some of those hours are not guaranteed to bring happiness for all of us, and that some of us will know very little peace no matter how much time we 're given. # One thing that disturbs us about apocalyptic talk is that it 's so unspecific. The end-times are always right around the corner, just ahead, very soon. But you can only cry wolf at the world for so many millennia before folks become a bit skeptical. How prolonged can " very soon " become, before you mistrust that anything is coming at all? # It 's like waiting for Godot, Samuel Beckett 's elusive character who is anticipated by a couple of loyal souls beyond all reason. The fact that letters from Paul and Peter written across the first century were meant to assure their original readers that the old world is passing, Jesus will return for judgment, and the new creation is on its way reminds us that even first-century Christians were finding the wait rather extensive. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God does not have a watch. It is all too easy for us to overlook the timelessness of the eternal. The definition of our mortality is that we 're affixed to the calendar, cycling through days and seasons, years and decades. We can do nothing outside of time and are relentlessly tethered to its effects. We grow up, and then we grow old. We grow tired and impatient. We mark time. # Whereas in eternity, in the always and now of God 's presence and sovereignty, a day or a thousand years is--what, really? More of the same? Does God view every moment of history since the dawn of creation at once, including every possible future? Does this quantum perspective contribute to God 's mercy and sense of justice, since all extenuating circumstances are laid out and all alternatives crystal clear? # Divine mercy is key to the mystery of why the end-times are taking so long. God 's intentions from the first moment of creation are benevolent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as a lover, not a jailer. Every act of rescue in salvation history is God 's way of buying us more time to right ourselves and repent our history. # God does n't need more time to get the endgame on. But we do. Because God would like nothing more than to spend eternity with every one of us. That 's the plan. Considering how few of us are judgment-ready at the moment, I 'd say any delay of the end-times can only be to our benefit. # Because when the Day of the Lord comes, it promises to be forensic. " Everything done on the earth will be found out "( 2 Pet. 3:10). We will no longer be able to hide behind the usual camouflage : the disguise of pseudo-piety, hidden thoughts and attitudes, smiling faces shielding false hearts. Everything will be on the table, which means anything going on under the table at the moment should be carefully reconsidered. # This is the whole point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's hidden will one day be revealed, " What sort of person ought you to be? "( 2 Pet. 3:11). Flamboyant descriptions about the heavens passing away with a roar and the earth melting down in flames are n't meant to be science fiction fodder. In the final analysis, it is really not about what happens to earth, or even what happens to us. Apocalypse is n't about the last day. It 's about today. # End-time talk is n't intended to make us anxious, guilt-ridden, or hyper. The last word on the matter is " be at peace "( 2 Pet. 3:14). Be at peace because we 're people of the promise. While everything evil will be bundled and tossed into the fire in the long run, believers await extreme renewal : new heavens and a new earth. We 'll be free of the endless disappointment of sin in a renewed realm where each happiness is n't dampened by some final bitterness or loss. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom come " arrives in full. # The question hovers in midair : Given all we believe about God, time, mercy, judgment, eternity, apocalypse, and the new creation, " What sort of person ought you to be? " Today, that is. # Given everything we say about tomorrow, how does that affect this moment? We may think we do n't have time for the end of the world right now. But now is the only part of forever we have the ability to change. # The Advent season conceals three shades of meaning as we contemplate the God-arrival into time : the birth of the child in the past, the return of the Christ in the future, and the imminent arrival of the holy. Our fond gaze into the crche has meaning only if we truly believe that the Jesus we find there remains with us today. # The good news we proclaim is n't about what happened long ago, in an ancient story in a yellowing book. The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ-life of every one of us. Kingdom comes in full tomorrow but proves itself today in acts of loving, forgiving, healing, and peacemaking. # Like most folks, I do n't want this world to end. I 'd like to walk down these streets a few more times, kiss a few more friends, share a few more meals. But aspects of this world are hard, cruel, sad, and obscene, and I 'd cheerfully roll them up and consign them to apocalyptic fires. In the meantime, there 's plenty of loving to do. #
