4023841 Last month, our fictional blogger, K., got some bad news of her own : The station where she works as a news producer was being bought, and her job was going bye-bye. Things were still awesome with her new beau, Neighbor Boy, but his ex was making K. feel a bit insecure. Plus, her BFF and roommate, Sarah, admitted she did n't really like him. Will K. get a break from all the drama? Friday, 05.09.08 Deal or No Deal? Today I had a meeting with Mel, my boss, to discuss my job( or lack thereof) once the station 's new management takes over. I explained that I was n't sure what I was going to do because I love the news... real news, not celebrity news. And it 's election season, which means covering politics is going to be really exciting. : Asha fuller " I understand where you 're coming from, K., " Mel began, " but there 's going to be a new show, and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called On the Issues, and it will consist of interviews with celebrities, their causes, their politics, and the like. If you 're interested, I 'd be more than happy to recommend you for the position. " Hmmm. That does sound like it could be interesting. But I do n't know. We discussed my other options. If I do n't want to take a new job under the station 's revised format, I can leave with a pretty decent severance package... plus a big bonus if I stay until the bitter end. Mel also said that he has a lot of contacts in the industry and he 'd be happy to put me in touch with people. That was a relief -- losing my job and not having any other options, even with severance and unemployment, would be damn scary. Lots to think about over the next month. Help! * Posted : 8:19 P.M. Sunday, 05.18.08 My Hero Neighbor Boy 's birthday is this weekend, and I was pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition for the perfect gift. " I 'm sorry I 've been such a brat about your relationship, " she said as we looked around one of the gadget stores for some fun e-toys for boys. " I think I 'm just predisposed to dislike the guys my friends date because I think no one 's good enough for them. " " I hear you, " I said. " But I 'm happy, and he 's a really great guy. I wish you 'd give us the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I 've made mistakes with guys before, but I 've also learned from them. " " I know, and if you think he 's great, he probably is, " Sarah told me. " I 'm going to be more supportive from now on. Promise. " Then she stopped in the middle of the aisle, snapped her fingers, and exclaimed, " Hey! Does he have Guitar Hero? " " No, but he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We picked up the latest version of the game and then went to another store for naughty undergarments. Perfect guy, perfect gift, back to the perfect relationship with my BFF.... Who needs a job? Well, okay, technically, I do need one, but maybe I can stop worrying so much and just enjoy what I do have for now. * Posted : 9:37 P.M. Sunday, 05.25.08 The Stepford Exes So, I 'm not sure what to think of Neighbor Boy 's party last night.... His ex, Ashley, was there, of course. I also got to meet a bunch of his other friends, which was great. Everyone was nice, but there were two friends in particular I 'm sort of weirded out by. The first one is Mickey. Like Ashley, she is petite and blond. She and Neighbor Boy lived together for a year... and not in a friendly roommate way either. The other friend was Amy : also petite, also blond, and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but they trekked through Nepal once. They were both very excited to meet me, and at one point, I found myself with the two of them, plus Ashley, and all they did was gush about how wonderful Neighbor Boy is. They were like the Stepford Exes. But it 's worth mentioning that( catty alert!) they all suck at Guitar Hero. Also, Neighbor Boy really liked his other birthday present, which was red and lacy and made an appearance after all the blonds had left the building. And let me tell you, judging by the smile on his face, I 'm positive he 's never seen moves like mine.... ;) * Posted : 3:46 P.M.
