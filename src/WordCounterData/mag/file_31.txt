2004141 Battling artic temperatures -- and the ocassional angry seal -- Eagle Scout Tim Brox discovers his life 's pursuit. Photograph Tim Brox, in his extreme cold weather gear, at the ceremonial South Pole. A Weddell seal pup shows it 's not as thrilled as Tim about participating in the 30-year tagging project. Photograph // Tim Brox of Troop 140 knew he was in for an adventure when he put on his standard-issue clothing. It was winter in Fesno, Calif., and most off his buddies were finishing their first semester of college. Tim, though, was trying on parkas. He 'd need a heavy coat while at the bottom of the world. Tim had beaten out a field of more than 150 other Eagle Scouts to participate in the 2001-02 NSF-BSA Antarctic Scientific Program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Boy Scouts of America. Tim was to spend almost eight weeks. He end up staying six months. Sunglasses at Night While it was late fall back home in California when Tim took off in October 2001, it was summer in Antarctica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day Tim visited the South Pole, it was minus 40 degrees! He was ready for that thanks to his big red parka. " It was bigger and warmer than anything I 've ever worn in California, " he says. What Tim could n't prepare for was the blinding brightness. Antarctica is a frozen tundra-98 percent ice sheet and 2 percent barren rock. All that ice and snow produces a serious glare. Add a little sunlight( which never sets during Antarctic summers), and you have a brilliance going in all directions -- like when sunlight hits a mirror.

" I 'd look around and say to myself, Where am I now? ' After a while, you realize you 're in the middle of nowhere. I would n't have been able to sleep, but luckily my dorm room did n't have any windows. " Elbow Grease No job was too big or small. At McMurdo Station, Antarctica 's largest scientific community, he worked with Raytheon Polar Services and spent a lot of time in the snowmobile shop. He learned light vehicle maintenance and repair, something, he says, " I knew absolutely nothing about when I started.

But instead of filling up a 15-gallon tank, a fuelie is responsible for filling up 50-gallon drums and airplane fuel tanks. Tim 's favorite job was at a satellite camp. He became involved with University of Minnesota researchers studying Weddell seals. For the past 30 years, teams of scientists have visited Antarctica and tagged seals. They later round them up and study their behavior, weight gain and loss and other factors. " I did the exact same jobs everyone else did, " Tim says proudly of his work tagging seals. " I 'd never been up close and personal with any large animal at all before this. An average adult was about 800 pounds, and they could easily be six feet long. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docile, though he did get scared a few times. " The seals were pretty nice, " he says. " They ca n't go too fast on the land, so if they got mad, you 'd just run away from them. I ran away a couple of times. They did n't chase me, though. They 're lazy. They just sunbathe all day. " Ice Sculptures Tim returned to California on March 21. After six months at the bottom of the world, he grew to appreciate the Antarctic landscape. He especially liked the pressure ridges, where two sheets of ice, shaped by wind and sun, push up against each other. " It 's absolutely beautiful, " he says. " It 's a winter wonderland down there. I 've never seen anything like it, but hope to see it again, and many more times. I ca n't think of another place on the earth as beautiful as Antarctica. " He might get a chance to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided he wants to be a research scientist, like his new friends at McMurdo Station. " I still keep in touch with a number of people from Antarctica, " Tim says. " They all shared my interests and helped me decide on my ultimate goal.
