2025541 <p> The Lab School of Washington gets results from learning-disabled students by using the arts as the core of its curriculum. <p> Imagine learning about Michelangelo by painting your own Sistine Chapel. At The Lab School of Washington in Washington, DC, ten-and eleven-year-olds not only paint ceilings, they also make frescoes and study the basic building techniques used for the great cathedrals. Students of the Renaissance illustrate their own time line with dates and events that becomes a history lesson. Later, instruction in Leonardo da Vinci 's use of perspective is applied when a science class goes outside to observe nature. And for an hour a day, the kids participate in the Renaissance Club costumed as members of the Council of Florence. <p> The arts cross over into every area of the curriculum at this innovative institution, which was founded in 1967 by Sally L.Smith and serves learning-disabled( LD) students from kindergarten through twelfth grade, many of them placed by the public school system. Students discover through hands-on experience how knowledge of one subject relates to others. The methods used at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning-disabled. <p> " Children draw and paint before they form letters, " says Smith, who is also the director of the graduate program Special Education : Learning Disabilities at The American University in Washington, DC. " The arts ignite the whole learning process, especially for LD youngsters, who are unable to understand their senses. The pattern on the tablecloth and the food on their plates come through to them with equal intensity and they ca n't focus on either one. With their scattered attention or over-reactiveness, they need order. " <p> At the Lab School, which also offers an evening adult-education program and a summer school, academic subjects are tackled through artistic problem solving. For example, in a sophomore math class, the structure of a tetrahedron( a polyhedron bounded by four triangular faces) might be explored by creating headgear of straws and paper clips that are then spray painted. In one of the school 's clubs, models of the pyramids and Greek temples are built by eight- and nine-year-old gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who also learn about mythology and early concepts of lawmaking. While studying King Arthur and Beowulf, children in a club representing the Middle Ages produce their own Bayeux tapestry and improve their handwriting through calligraphy. The Industrialists Club enables older students to play the roles of great robber barons and inventors, and their lessons are brought to life by making everything from a model of a train and tracks to a stock-market chart. <p> In the arts, solutions take many forms, an approach underscored in the teaching of Elliot Eisner, a professor of education and art at Stanford University in Stanford, California. " Not all problems have a single, correct answer, " Eisner says. " The arts teach that the grass is not simply green ; it is lavender, gray, gold. And when it is green, its varieties are endless. " Says Smith, " Through the arts, a child is helped to sort out one color, one shape, one form. Discriminating with the body, hands, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of artistic experience. " Such skills assist the youngster in understanding the world. <p> " Someone who has difficulty expressing him- or herself can communicate clearly through at least one art form, " adds Smith, who also believes that the visual and performing arts employ skills parallel to those used in everyday life. For example, she relates visual and applied art forms to specific developmental abilities : collage, for planning and for distinguishing and separating multiple elements ; architecture, for its applications of math, social studies, and history as well as its attention to visual detail ; puppetry, for its emphasis on language arts, social skills, and hand-eye coordination ; printmaking, for developing reading readiness through left-fight orientation and for pattern recognition ; and film making, for its accent on cause and effect and its attention to detail, to following a theme, and to organization. <p> A mural of ocean animals made of carpet remnants, Carpet Art : A Statement About Clean Water, which hangs in the school corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist who organized the project taught students how to make schematics, cut, organize( the pieces fit together like a puzzle), and glue. Each child did what he or she was best at. <p> A tour of the Lab School reveals many such examples of the students ' artistic endeavors. In the library is a shelf of books constructed of handmade paper and featuring their stories and illustrations ; on the window sills are sculptures of recycled plastic bottles covered with plaster-impregnated gauze ; in the dance studio/concert room, the ceiling is tiled with African print patterns ; and one corridor on each floor has an archaeologist 's display case filled with rock and mineral specimens unearthed in the school 's backyard. Smith 's own office has ceiling-to-floor art work, the most imaginative being a Modern Art reading lamp a la Miro, made, of course, by a student.

And this past summer the Lab School organized a workshop to present its methods to inner-city teachers. <p> Recently, twenty art instructors from around the country were invited to the school for a seminar called The Power of Art -- Educating Students With Learning Disabilities, the school 's first such program. Some of the instructors were accredited teachers, some were professional artist-teachers, and one was adocent-turned-teacher. They displayed their students ' quilts, self-portrait masks, ethnic puppets, sculptured animals, totempoles, and hieroglyphics created for history, writing, and science projects. <p> Also attending was the artist Robert Rauschenberg, who discovered his dyslexia only in adulthood. The seminar was sponsored by the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation( a similar workshop is planned for 1995), and the artist himself had been the first recipient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. At a reception at the National Gallery of Art, Rauschenberg advised giving LD children special encouragement. He noted that reading had always been difficult for him. " I was considered slow. While my classmates were reading their textbooks, I drew in the margins, " he recalled. " The possibility always exists to nourish an important new genius in learning-disabled children, if their spirit is not broken and creative dreams are allowed to develop. " <p> The highlight of the seminar was the unveiling of a huge, two-dimensional cutout sculpture of Hanuman, the monkey god of Indian mythology who could accomplish the **27;115;TOOLONG of marine plywood and bolted to the building, the sculpture was dedicated to Rauschenberg. All the students in the school had cut out a portion, sealed it, and painted it or affixed to it Hanuman 's " jewels "( bottle caps) or " armor "( aluminum or copper).

The arts provide the structure and discipline -- from the simplest form of mastery to the most complex -- that allow children to succeed, and The Lab School of Washington is a testament to how well an arts-driven curriculum can work for them, especially when they 're learning-disabled.When Sally L. Smith says that " the arts are not a frill but need to be central-not peripheral-to the learning process to make a difference, " it 's a clarion call for school administrators everywhere. <p> For more information on The Lab School of Washington or the 1995 Power of Art workshop, write to the school at : 4759 Reservoir Road N.W., Washington, DC 20007 ; or call :( 202) 965-6600. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : A student-made mural, constructed of multicolored carpet remnants that fit together like a puzzle, decorates a corridor in The Lab School of Washington <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet in length, this Earth Quilt is from the Hamlin Robinson School of Seattle, Washington, an elementary school for creative, dyslexic children.
