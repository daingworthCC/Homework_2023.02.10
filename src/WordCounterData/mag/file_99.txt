2012241 BAZAAR PROFILE Headnote To mark the arrival of a new biography of Pelly Guyyenheim, we asked Karole P. B. Vail to tell the story of her grandmother, the legendary, idiosyncratic art collector. // It was not until I was in my early 30s that I truly began to understand my paternal grandmother, Peggy Guggenheim. I first met her when I was a little girl in Venice, Italy, where she lived. I would go there with my sister and parents ; and Peggy would sometimes visit us in Paris, where I grew up. However, I did not ever see much of my grandmother, as there was a love-hate relationship between her and my father, Sindbad. He was her first child from her marriage to Lawrence Vail in 1922.( She went on to have a daughter as well, my aunt, Pegeen.) My father resented the fact that Peggy had always focused on herself and her art collection rather than on her own family. It was clear that she did not want to leave the collection to her family, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better mother and grandmother. In fact, she bequeathed it to the Guggenheim Foundation, along with her home on the Grand Canal. Now I think it would have been a terrible pity to divide her unique collection among so many grandchildren and, in effect, ruin her life 's work and only honest commitment. Peggy 's own childhood had not been easy. Her mother paid her little attention, and her father, Benjamin Guggenheim, was a notorious philanderer until he died on the Titanic in 1912. Though Peggy inherited some money, she was never endlessly wealthy like Doris Duke or Barbara Hutton, as has often been erroneously believed ; she always minded her purse. Peggy had lived in Paris with Vail, an American writer and artist who introduced her to modern literature and art, but it was not until 1938, after they had divorced, that her own venture into art began, with the opening of her Guggenheim Jeune gallery in London. Here she showed works by Cocteau, Kandinsky, Tanguy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated her time to purchasing art in London and Paris. In 1941, she left Europe with surrealist artist Max Ernst, to whom she was briefly married. In October 1942, Peggy opened a gallery named Art of This Century that became the most exciting venue in New York for contemporary art. She organized many solo exhibitions for emerging American artists and gave Jackson Pollock his first four solo exhibitions. In 1948, she showed her collection at the Biennale in Venice, where she settled until the end of her life in 1979. She had already assembled her legendary collection and acquired little thereafter.

Portrait of Peggy Guggenheim, 1926, by Alfred Courmes. // My sister and I used to call her Grandma-the-Dogs, because she had many Lhasa apso terriers, which we loved, and in order to differentiate her from our maternal grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the full run of the house. Everyone else called her Peggy, including the other grandchildren. I think she quite liked to be called Grandma, especially in her old age, maybe because it made her feel part of the family. Grandma-the-Dogs seemed more personable, though she maintained a certain distance from children, as if they bored her, which they probably did. When I was 13 or 14 years old, an awkward age by any standard, I felt the most terrible anxiety about spending the Easter vacation in Venice. My sister and I shared a bedroom that was painted a bright emerald green. We slept in a four-poster bed, and there was a beautiful, but slightly gloomy, black marble bathroom for our exclusive use. These rooms are where many of the paintings by Pollock hang today. Then, in the bedroom, there was a painting that I found spooky : Paul Delvaux 's The Break of Day, representing naked tree ladies, who peered down at us with their large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernst 's Attirement of the Bride, which we found terrifying, even repellent! Instead I responded to Pollock and tried my luck at splashing paint onto paper. When my grandmother 's collection was exhibited at the Orangerie in Paris in 1974, I remember that she stayed with us at our home. My father would delight in antagonizing visiting journalists with the " small Pollocks " that hung on our walls at home. They were, in fact, painted by me. We were not allowed to go too close to her paintings in Venice, but we could " play " with the sculptures in the overgrown garden. We used to ride on them, especially Jean Arp 's wonderfully organic Amphora fruit bronze, which just begged to be mounted. But what we loved most were the stone sea horses on the canal terrace that transported us across the lagoon in our wildest fantasies. Playing in the Venetian garden was always a welcome respite from the house and from the tension between my parents and my grandmother. Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Whenever we actually traveled on water, it was either in her beautiful gondola adorned with lions-the symbol of Venice-or her sleek Riva motorboat. The gondola was always the object of photographers trying to get a snapshot of " the last dogaressa "( or doge 's wife), as Peggy was known in Venice. The gondola was used to cruise from church to church, where I was ordered to go and look at the paintings and frescoes and then report back on what I had seen. Peggy cut an imposing figure in her extravagant outfits : Indian caftans, sandals of her own design inspired by a Carpaccio figure, large rings, and her eccentric, surreal sunglasses. Unfortunately, I never saw her wear her gold lame Fortuny dress, which must have been quite beautiful. Though not classically attractive, Peggy was striking in her own way and did not succumb to fashion dictates. Her style was her own, and always idiosyncratic, which I found embarrassing as a teenager but certainly admire today. Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where magnificent Cubist paintings by Georges Braque, Juan Gris, Fernand Leger, and Pablo Picasso adorned the walls along with an exquisite Robert Delaunay Windows painting. The room was furnished with Renaissance chests and chairs, which perfectly counterbalanced the modern paintings. There were times, often in the summer, when we would eat on a large glass table in the hallway, surrounded by more Picassos, a large mobile by Calder, and a Giacometti plaster cast. Gazing at the paintings was the wise thing to do, as the food was not of the highest quality, and neither was the wine. If a friend invited us we would go out for lunch at Harry 's Bar, which Peggy loved but found very expensive. She usually demanded a discount, even if she was not paying, and it was always graciously given by Mr. Cipriani. At night, Peggy and I would eat, often alone, in the library, meals of tomatoes, sardines, and stale breadsticks, as the servants had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the servants ate better and drank better wine, and I was not wrong. I think that Peggy probably never forgot that she had had to tighten her belt when her father died, and when she seriously began to collect. So she could be quite mean, but at other times she was quite magnanimous in her giving. Though she was not one to send out birthday cards, she would usually give my parents a handsome amount of cash to buy us fancy clothes or anything else that pleased us. I wish I had asked her more questions about her life in Paris during World War II and in New York City, as well as about the personalities who visited her in Venice. But my interests were more literary at the time, and I devoured Samuel Beckett 's plays. It is thanks to Peggy-who had had a brief affair with the playwright after her marriage to Vailthat I had dinner one evening with him, together with my parents. Beckett, if anything, was even more overpowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonguetied all evening, much to my outrage thereafter! My recollections of Peggy are very mixed-ambivalent, angry, sympathetic-and quite ironic in light of my life today. It is only recently that I have recognized the legacy that Peggy has left me, something I could never have anticipated when I was a surly adolescent girl. I often wonder why she did not give each of her grandchildren any of her paintings and sculptures, instead of donating all of them to museums and institutions around the world. Maybe she wanted to educate and help museums, or maybe she felt that everyone, independently of family ties, should do their own thing, regardless of what has come before. The irony is that I now have become a keeper of sorts for her. I have organized several exhibitions about her in the past few years, and I am striving to keep a photographic archive. I want to keep her flame alive, because the collection she created is truly her lasting legacy-one that she wanted to give to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A Biography of Peggy Guggenheim, by Anton Gill, is published this month by HarperCollins. // <p>
