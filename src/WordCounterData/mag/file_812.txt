4182941 <h> Share : <p> A whole year of angst over the Stark sisters ' squabbles and whether one of them would kill the other wrapped up rather nicely in Game of Thrones season finale, when Arya and Sansa put aside their differences and took care of Littlefinger once and for all. But it was a little too nice of a conclusion, since it seemed like a big jump for Sansa to go from thinking her sister was plotting against her to conspiring with her against Game of Thrones ' most devious villain. And in fact, it was a bigger jump than the show originally intended. According toIsaac Hempstead Wright, the actor who plays Bran, a deleted scene from the show explains how Sansa got wise to her sister 's plan. <p> In an interview with Variety, Wright said they filmed a scene where Sophie Turner 's Sansa " knocks on Bran 's door and says, ' I need your help, ' or something along those lines, " because " it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she guts her own sister. " Good thing she did. <p> There was a hint of that unseen conversation during Littlefinger 's " trial, " when Bran said Baelish had held a knife to Ned 's throat in King 's Landing, and Arya knew he had lied about Tyrion owning the Catspaw assassin 's dagger. But the whole thing makes way more sense if a distraught and unsure Sansa went to her weirdo, all-seeing brother first, to double check with him about what had been happening. Really, there 's nothing nicer than checking the video tape, even if all the footage is stored in your strange brother 's head. <p> What do you think? Should they have kept that scene in the episode?
