2010741 Sometimes they 're sweet, sometimes they 're scary, but your child 's nighttime musings can tell you what 's on his mind... if you know the right way to interpret them. Here 's the scoop. BY GINNY GRAVES // Heidi Eigsti, 35, of Lakewood, Colorado, says her third child was about a month old when 4-year-old Ryan, iicr oldest, awoke in a weepy funk. " He told me he had dreamed that he was yelling for me and I did n't come, " Eigsti says. " Even a sleep-deprived new mommy can figure out what that one means. " Like e-mail from the subconscious, your child 's dreams bear messages about his innermost thoughts and feelings. " Dreams give parents a wonderful opportunity to learn more about their children, because they often convey information that kids are unable to express, or even fully understand, themselves, " says Patricia Garfield, Ph.D., president of the Association for the Study of Dreams( ASD). Here 's the lowdown on how to decode those dreams-and deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The dream lives of babies remain a mystery for one simple reason : No 2-month-old has ever woken up and said, " I had the darnedest dream last night.... Scientists do know, however, that even in the womb, infants spend much of their time in rapid eye movement( REM) sleep, during which dreaming usually occurs in older children and adults. In fact, full-term babies spend 50 percent, and premature babies log up to 80 percent, of their total sleep time in the REM stage, as compared with the 20 to 25 percent REM sleep in adults. The large amounts of REM sleep early on may actually be critical to the emotional and sensory development of your baby, experts say. The search for meaning : If your infant does have dreams, they probably help her incorporate new information into her ever-expanding worldview, and perhaps even give her the chance to test-drive new skills. Kelly Bulkeley, Ph.D., past president of ASD, relates the story of a mother who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, something he 'd never done before. A week later, he laughed for the first time when he was awake. " It 's very possible he was learning how to do so in his dreams, " says Dr. Bulkeley, who also is coauthor of Dreamcatching : Every Parent 's Guide to Exploring and Understanding Children 's Dreams and Nightmares. Helping kids navigate the night : If your baby wakes up and a process of elimination( dry diaper, no fever, well -- fed) leads you to suspect a dream is the culprit, rub her back and comfort her in your most soothing " there, there " manner. If she has a stuffed animal or blanket, stroke her cheek with it to get her attention, then hand it to her, and when she 's calm, split. ONE- AND 2-YEAR-OLDS The dream scene : The thinking goes that your child 's dreams evolve along with his verbal and cognitive abilities, says Rafael Pelayo, M.D., head of pediatric services at the Stanford Sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " play " mentally-pretend to be a puppy, say-his dream machine is probably starting to create brief, simple images, usually of pet animals. The search for meaning : Why animals, you ask? Toddlers identify in a big way with cute little creatures who have to do as they 're told. However, you probably wo n't be aware of these warm and fuzzy animal dreams. What you will know about are nightmares, since they have enough emotional oomph to awaken her. If your kid seems to be having a lot of bad dreams, remember this : Nightmares deal with things that( continued on page 194) challenge the dreamer 's sense of the world, which, for children, applies to just about everything. In very young children, bad dreams are often triggered by separation anxiety, which may be even more acute at night when a child is lying in a crib or bed alone. Helping kids navigate the night : As the official bogeyman-banisher, offer love and comfort-specifically, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's okay, Mommy 's here. " If your child is fairly verbal, Dr. Bulkeley recommends saying, " Dreams are stories we tell ourselves when we 're sleeping. They may look scary, but they ca n't hurt you. " Do n't worry too much if she does n't get the concept just yet. With time and repetition, it will sink in. 3- TO 5-YEAR-OLDS The dream scene : Now that your child 's imagination has kicked into high gear, expect her dream life to, also. This is the age at which nightmare frequency peaks. Count on more early -- morning awakenings, when nightmares usually strike, populated by monsters, witches, all-purpose bad guys, and scary animals. " Children this age also frequently dream that bad things happen to themselves or people in their families, " says Richard Gallagher, Ph.D., director of the Parenting Institute at New York University 's Child Study Center in Manhattan. The search for meaning : Preschoolers ' main struggle is to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people-you, her siblings, her favorite friends-doing familiar things. " It 's as if children were repeating to themselves, These are the people I know and trust. If I ever need help, I can rely on them, " ' says Alan Siegel, Ph.D., a child psychologist specializing in children 's dreams. Prepare yourself for the day, however, when your little angel 's subconscious transforms you into a wild animal or a terrible monster. Before you assume your child is harboring some hideous resentment toward you, remember : You 're the one who( often) says no. Your child 's bad dreams actually help her deal with your anger and disapproval, both of which are frightening and confusing. Helping kids navigate the night : To get a better handle on your child 's fears and concerns, encourage her to explore her dreams by asking open-ended questions. How did it feel to be chased by a rabbit? What happened next? If the dream was frightening, sympathize with her fear, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy and Daddy) have bad dreams sometimes. Helping her draw a picture of the nightmare can also minimize its impact. If your child seems especially troubled by the dream, explain to her that she can change the dream should it recur. " Even very young children can start manipulating their dreams, " says Dr. Pelayo. When in REM, she could use a magic wand to make the tiger disappear, or glue could keep the dog 's mouth shut. You can even rehearse the new dream plot by acting it out to help embed the dream 's new ending in her memory. // DREAM THEMES DECODED // Sometimes scary dreams cross the threshold into night terrors, a sleep disorder that occurs in the first half of the night during the deepest non-REM stages of sleep and peaks between the ages of 3 and 7, afflicting one in four kids. In a standard episode, the child will be wide-eyed, screaming, and flailing about, but oblivious to your presence. Try not to restrain your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own( usually within 15 minutes), and find solace in the fact that she wo n't remember it in the morning, says Mark Mahowald, M.D., director( continued on page 196) of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. 6- TO 12-YEAR-OLDS The dream scene : This is the stage at which dreams become infused with more grown-up social concerns. Nancy Odom, mother of 6-year-old Laurel, in Auburn, California, notes : " Laurel 's dreams are less frightening but more anxiety -- provoking now. She 'll dream about kids at school being mean to her or ignoring her. " By age 6, the frequency of dreaming stabilizes, so that older children are spending the same amount of their total sleep time in REM as adults, about 25 percent. Between the ages of 9 and 12, children 's dreams start resembling adults ' in terms of length( an average of about 20 minutes) and complexity. The search for meaning : Odds are, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top three good dreams are enjoying a fun activity, getting a new possession, and performing well, all of which are usually straightforward wish-fulfillment scenarios. The most common bad dreams include being chased and attacked, which may occur when your child feels under too much pressure ; sensing something scary in the offing, which reveals that she thinks some troubling real-life situation will get worse ; and injury or death, which can carry the message, " I feel hurt. " Helping kids navigate the night : Do n't indulge in armchair analysis of your child 's dreams. Instead, encourage discussion by offering up one of your own dreams. " The communication that occurs in family dream-sharing can help children feel reassured and understood, " says Dr. Siegel. When bad dreams crop up, prompt her to talk about them with interested questions-What did you do next? How did that make you feel? When nightmares recur, take it as a sign that your child is at some sort of psychological impasse. To locate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream, and try to connect the emotions in the dream with things that could be troubling her in her waking life. If nightmares persist in spite of your best efforts, discuss the situation with your pediatrician.
