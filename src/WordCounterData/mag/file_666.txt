4149041 When the difference between winning gold and going home empty-handed is measured in milliseconds, it pays to perfect every last detail. That 's why the U.S. Olympic team tapped some of the brightest minds in tech for help before departing for Russia. When the athletes assemble beside the Black Sea in Sochi, here are a few of the breakthroughs that will help them chase gold. # SKI SUITS # Spyder has been streamlining ski suits since the 1970s. The company 's mid- ' 90s SpeedWyre technology--running the length of the arms and legs like the spoiler on a car--was so effective in reducing drag it was banned after two seasons by the sport 's governing body. Today the company strives for a similar slipperiness by tinkering with yarn diameter, reducing the profile of padding and seams, and varying the textures imprinted on the skintight fabric. Textile choices play a role in safety too. As speed skiers have learned, if a suit is n't air-permeable, it can melt into the skin during the high-speed skid that follows a spill. # More Wearable Tech # Ski Boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fischer and Salomon have both developed boot shells that can be molded to match each athlete 's foot and lower leg, dialing in control. # Ski Jumpsuits # To halt the rise of high-flying " squirrel suits, " ski jump officials toughened the rules in 2011, mandating that the suits be skintight. # Skating Skins # Under Armour 's speed-skating skins--developed with computational fluid dynamics expertise from Lockheed Martin--logged more than 300 hours of wind-tunnel testing. # HELMETS # For years a helmet 's goal was to prevent skull fractures, but designers are now working on ways to fight concussions too. # The Giro Combyn helmet, worn by athletes including U.S. half-pipe-hopeful Gretchen Bleiler and already on the market for consumers, has a vinyl--nitrile liner and a flexible shell designed to withstand the multi-impact falls common in BMX, skateboard, and snowboard events. The materials remain pliable in the cold, transmitting less energy to the brain in the event of a wipeout. # Norway 's Aksel Lund Svindal, the Super-G gold medalist in 2010, wears headgear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The shell has an inner membrane that slides during impact, dissipating the rotational forces unleashed on the head. # Aerial and mogul skiers will use technology designed by HIP-TEC, a company that creates sport-specific liners using data from rotational- and blunt-force crashes. The tech should be available for consumers this spring. # BIATHLON : SHOOTING # Few sports present the rigors of the biathlon. Competitors on skating skis must go from a heart-pounding sprint around the course to the preternatural stillness required to shoot at five targets--no bigger than the lids of beer cans--in rapid succession, without wasting a single bullet. Misfire just once and you earn yourself a 150-meter detour to the penalty loop or an extra minute on your time. Here 's what happens on the firing range. # 1. Firing Range # 0-8 seconds : The athlete skis onto the range and dumps his poles.9-12 seconds : The athlete unshoulders his rifle and assumes the shooting position--standing or prone.13-22 seconds : With hips and shoulders square to the target, the athlete brings the rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timed to the end of a heartbeat. In training, athletes use lasers to practice pulling the trigger for each successive target just as the sight crosses the plane of the bull's-eye. All five shots are fired within roughly 7 seconds.23-32 seconds : The athlete dumps the spent clip( housed in the stock), swings the rifle onto his back, grabs his poles, and starts pumping away on his skis.2 Heart of a Champion # A biathtete 's heart rate can plummet from 180 to 130 beats per minute in the time it takes to fire off five rounds. The deep troughs indicate the rate when shooting from a prone position. The shallower troughs were recorded from a standing position. One reason to fire quickly--besides the ticking clock--is that the drop in heart rate can cause muscle twitches, disrupting aim. # 3. Anatomy of the Rifle # A. Stock The wood laminate may look retro, but it ably withstands shifts in temperature. It 's also easy to customize. As athletes shed weight over the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey uses a Dremel and sandpaper to remove material, or an epoxy-based putty to add bulk. # B. Bolt While the bolt of a standard.22 requires a twist to lock and unlock, the bolt on a 3.5-kilominimum biathlon rifle operates via a simple push-pull action, allowing the athlete to maintain his aim, chest against the stock, for the entire sequence. # C. Barrel Made from the finest-quality steel--hence the $5000 price tag an certain rifles--the barrel is polished with a jeweler 's precision, making it accurate in frigid conditions. Because the metal grain can contract in the cold, a typical.22 would not be nearly accurate enough at below-zero F temperatures. # Ammo : Bullets can vary in shape and size, so athletes test dozens of rounds looking for the batch with the best fit between barrel and missile. But first they cool the bullets and the gun to minus 4 F. # LUGE # The new sled 's carbon-fiber chassis rests on state-of-the-art runners. To determine which metal composite performed best in varying temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 options. The smoother ride cuts down on driver fatigue--no small plus given the grueling posture athletes adopt to remain aerodynamic. # BOBSLED # Michael Scully, 3 race car driver and car designer, recently led a BMW effort to redesign Team USA 's bobsled. " Unlike a car, where braking g 's or turning g 's build up predictably, " he says, " in a bobsled they ramp from zero to well over 5 g 's almost instantly--they hit you like a hammer. " Scully 's team, based in California, focused on smoothing the ride--perhaps paving the way for the first U.S. medal in the two-man event since 1952. # A. Sleek The new carbon-fiber shell is slimmer than most, particularly up front, where BMW trimmed much of the bulk from the nose. # B. Fast The BMW design team used computational fluid dynamics to streamline the sled 's skin to help it slice the air at the myriad angles experienced during a bobsled run. # C. Shifty While the sled 's total weight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. BMW worked to lower the sled 's polar moment of inertia, or resistance to turning on its long axis, which helps it move efficiently through the banking, twisting turns of the course. # THE HOCKEY SKATE # When four-time Olympic speed skater Dave Cruikshank first started teaching hockey players how to pick up the pace, he was dismayed to discover that their less-than-nimble feet were trapped in technology dating back to the sputnik era. " It was like watching them put snow tires on a Ferrari, " he says. Inspired by the challenge, Cruikshank enlisted support from NHL legend Mario Lemieux and set to work on a skate upgrade. His masterpiece, the Easton Mako, has since been adopted by NHL stars Joe Pavelski, Erik Johnson, and Ryan Kesler. And now it will propel U.S. Olympians across the ice in Sochi. Thanks to the heat-moldable liners, the players no longer have to bind their feet with tape or cram them into small skates to get the snuggest fit. The blades tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of a starting block in track and field. And the hinged rear spine and pliable tongue make it easier to flex the ankle, allowing an athlete to drive completely through each stride and generate greater force--much like a 100-meter sprinter. # BIG CHILL # When lack of snow forced Sochi to cancel two World Cup ski events in February 2013, it sent a shiver down the spine of Olympic officials--and with good reason. An unexpected thaw in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2010 compelled organizers to shuttle snow to the games via helicopter. And until recently, Sochi was best known as a palm-tree-laden summer retreat with average winter temperatures of around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It is a favorite vacation spot of Vladimir Putin 's( and, formerly, of Stalin 's). The ski and snowboard venues lie nearly 30 ' miles inland, at up to 7600 feet above sea level, and normally receive ample snowfall. But the Russians have vowed not to rely on nature. With the help of Michigan-based SMI Snowmakers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump 12,151 gallons of water per minute up the mountainside to 403 snowmaking guns, all linked to SMI 's software by fiber-optic cables. Just in case, though, the Russians also stockpiled snow last winter--16 million cubic feet of it--beneath giant thermal blankets.
