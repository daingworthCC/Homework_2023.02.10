2018841 Section : MUTUAL FUNDS <p> Introducing the MONEY 20 -- a score of mutuals whose performance over the long haul has separated them from the pack. That makes them superb choices, whatever your financial goals. <p> Over a long distance, the race goes not to the sprinters, but rather to the most consistent runners. So it is with mutual funds. The funds that make most investors feel comfortable -- not to mention richer -- are those that deliver above-average returns year after year and manage to avoid serious stumbles. Thus we present the MONEY 20 -- our own carefully selected roster of 10 stock and 10 bond funds that, above all else, have delivered superior returns for the risks they take. <p> Our selections, listed in the table on page 122 and profiled below, are divided into three stock and three bond fund categories designed for investors with different life goals. Whether you are looking for a growth fund to build college savings for your two-year-old or a high-yielding government bond fund to live off in retirement, you should be able to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply the best we could identify for patient investors -- those who can hold a fund for the five years or so that investments often need to reveal their underlying quality. <p> Before you pull out your checkbook, however, remember that the best way to invest in mutual funds is to dollar-cost average -- that is, to salt your account with equal amounts at regular intervals, thereby lowering your average cost per share. The strategy is especially key right now. The economy is weak, Mid-east tensions have ignited oil prices, and the short-term outlook for the stock and bond markets is dubious at best. <p> How did we choose our elite? First, we screened 592 funds, ranking them within categories according to a measure devised by Stanford University finance professor William Sharpe. Sharpe 's formula rewards strong performance and penalizes funds for wide swings in price. <p> Next we threw out any fund that had changed its portfolio manager or investment approach in the past five years. That eliminated such stalwarts as Fidelity Magellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top. We also ditched any funds that may have enjoyed a one-time boost be cause of a narrow investment focus( like sector funds). And because of the instability of the junk bond market, we dropped high-yield funds from our competition, though we retained funds that merely dabble in the risky paper. <p> Last, we eliminated funds with annual expenses significantly greater than their Category averages. In cases where load and no-load funds were judged roughly comparable, we chose the less expensive no-loads. <p> The MONEY 20 updates the roster of Recommended Funds that we 've followed monthly in Fund Watch since April 1989. We will track the MONEY 20 in the same fashion, monitoring them for flagging performance and management switcheroos. If a fund stops measuring up, we 'll replace it. <p> Here, then, are profiles of the MONEY 20. The stock fund categories appear first. Within the six groupings, funds are listed in order of their five-year returns. GROWTH <p> AIM Weingarten. AIM manager Harry Hutzler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to sniff out the market 's direction. After managing the $650 million growth fund for 21 years, he says, " I 'm all too familiar with the pitfalls of trying to predict markets. " Instead, Hutzler and co-manager Jonathan Schoolar, 29, keep the 5.5%-load fund fully invested in the sector they know best : growth stocks. <p> In fact, Weingarten is the MONEY 20 's purest example of growth investing. The fund 's 80 stocks have a five-year average earnings growth rate of 21% -- compared with 8.2% for the stocks in the S &P; 500. Up 9.8% in the seven months to Aug. 1, the fund has the highest five-year total return of our 20 funds. But there 's a price : volatility, again the highest of our selections. <p> Hutzler and Schoolar split their portfolio between mainstream growth stocks such as Pepsico( recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $75.25) and dark horses that they believe are poised to surprise Wall Street with higher than expected earnings. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil squeeze : Schlumberger( NYSE, $66) and Halliburton( NYSE, $56.50), both oil-service firms. <p> Janus Venture. You might expect this $245 million Denver no-load to be our riskiest entry, since it specializes in small-company stocks, a notoriously flighty corner of the market. But under manager James Craig, 34, who has run the fund since 1985, Venture has been only 80% as volatile as the S &P; 500, even while beating the market by an average of 4.5 percentage points over each of the past three years. Craig 's secret, in large part, is his willingness to shed stocks when he considers the market shaky. In early August, the fund was a cautious 25% in cash, and in light of the Mideast crisis, Craig is in no hurry to put that money to work : " Rising oil prices could keep interest rates high, which is not good for my kind of stocks. " <p> As a stock picker, Craig favors neglected small companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recent buys : retailer Leslie Yaye( recently traded over the counter at $12.75 a share), which he sees rising to $20 after upgrading its line of women 's apparel, and Healthcare Services Group( OTC, $22.75), a nursing-home services firm that he thinks could hit $30 a share within a year. <p> SteinRoe Special. SteinRoe co-managers Richard Weiss, 39, and Carlene Murphy, 34 -- fund stewards since 1981 and ' 86, respectively -- try to find companies in which earnings are about to pop because of a new product or trend. But they also aim to buy at low cost, often at 40% to 50% discounts to the price the concern would fetch in an acquisition. Recent buys : CRSS( NYSE, $14), a Houston engineering and construction firm, and Mesa Limited Partnership( NYSE, $4.75), an oil-and-gas producer that Weiss and Murphy expect to benefit from ballooning oil prices. <p> The strategy has earned the $400 million no-load a 128% return over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund. The fund 's volatility : slightly below the average. <p> SoGen International. Despite its name and French sponsor( the megabank Societe Generale), this uniquely flexible 3.75%-load fund defies categorization as a conventional international fund -- or, for that matter, as a conventional anything. Recently, Jean-Marie Eveillard, 50, SoGen 's helmsman since 1979, had 26% of the $203 million portfolio in U.S. stocks, 14% in foreign equities, 28% in U.S. and foreign bonds, 8% in gold and a liberal 24% in cash. Such broad diversification has helped make SoGen not only the least volatile of our four growth choices, but also less risky than 194 of the 196 growth funds we follow. At the same time, the five-year average annual gain has been superb : 17% compared with 13.8% for the typical growth fund. <p> Already pessimistic about the fragile U.S. economy, Eveillard has turned even more bearish in the wake of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. The shock of rapidly rising oil prices, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " America built up huge debt levels in the 1980s, " he says. " It was an accident waiting to happen. " Consequently, Eveillard intends to keep a high cash position ; recent purchases have focused on out-of-favor securities such as junk bonds( 4% of the portfolio) and healthy savings banks( 2%) that he thinks have been wrongly tarred with their markets ' well-publicized troubles. TOTAL RETURN <p> United Income. All that you can count on in the stock market, says United manager Russell Thompson, 50, is that things wo n't stand still. In his view, the way to make money is to anticipate changes before anyone else. Specifically, Thompson, the $1.7 billion fund 's manager since 1979, looks for solid, dividend-paying blue chips that will benefit from cyclical economic trends. " Most of the stocks we own are household names, " he says. Example : ITT( NYSE, $54.75), which at 2.5% of assets is the fund 's largest holding. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of the 5% of funds that still charge a platinum-plated 8.5% load. The equity-income entry posted a 140% five-year return to Aug. 1, placing it in the top 5% of all stock funds. Volatility : 5% lower than that of the average stock fund. <p> Financial Industrial Income. In contrast to United, which gets most of its income from stock dividends, $550 million Industrial Income relies heavily on bonds as well to generate yield. Manager John Kaweske, 48, the no-load 's pilot since 1985, currently has 20% of the equity-income fund in conventional corporates and convertibles, including 6% in high-yield issues. That has helped boost the fund 's yield to 4%, compared with 3.5% for the S &P.; <p> Letting bonds support the fund 's income gives Kaweske a free hand to invest the rest of the portfolio for growth. Currently Kaweske likes pharmaceuticals like Eli Lilly( NYSE, $78.25) and Bristol-Myers Squibb( NYSE, $61.50), which he figures have the cash flow and pricing flexibility needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America. Last year, five of this 5.75%-load fund 's 10 largest holdings rose in value by 50% or more. That 's the kind of record you might expect from a superhot emerging growth fund -- not from a $6 billion institution that invests mostly in household-name blue chips like Philip Morris( NYSE, $45.25), the fund 's largest holding, which rose 64% last year. <p> Investment decisions are made by lead manager William Newton, 59, and five co-managers, each of whom is responsible for investing a separate portion of the fund 's assets. " None of us are hot or cold all at once toward the market, " says Newton. " That tends to reduce volatility. " The team approach, plus an above-average yield of 3.7%, have helped keep ICA 's risk level slightly lower than that of the average growth and income fund. Meanwhile, five-year average annual gains, at 17%, rank in the category 's top 5%. <p> Phoenix Balanced. The only balanced fund on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its assets in bonds, primarily three-year Treasuries. Patricia Bannan, 28, who has managed the fund since 1985, varies the allocation based on her economic outlook, though the fixed-income slice can never go below 25%. Still, the 6.9%-load fund gained 390% over the past 10 years, tops among balanced funds. <p> On the stock side, Bannan is a classic growth investor who focuses on short-term earnings momentum and long-term growth rates. Disciplined and decisive, she will dump a stock instantly if it fails to live up to her expectations. " That keeps you from falling in love with the stock, " she says. In an economy hampered by rising oil prices and sluggish growth, she expects that consistent earners like Merck( NYSE, $83) and Waste Management( NYSE, $37.50) will continue to post strong gains. OVERSEAS <p> T. Rowe Price International Stock. The London-based management team for this $1.3 billion fund has proved that old-fashioned growth-stock investing works as well abroad as it does at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46, who 's been the no-load 's top gun since 1985, International seeks out large and medium-size companies with prospects for steady, dependable growth. " We 'd rather have consistent returns than spectacular gains in some years and lousy ones in others, " says Wade. So far, so good : despite the extra currency risk of investing abroad, the fund has been about 10% less volatile than the average domestic growth fund. At the same time, its 255% return over the past five years places it in the top 25% in its category. <p> The portfolio covers 24 countries, with the largest portions going to Japan( 24%), Germany( 15%) and the U.K.( 15%). Despite this year 's 14% run-up in German stock prices, Wade is still bullish on German engineering and construction companies that he thinks will benefit from that country 's reunification. Two such firms : Siemens( $86.25) and Mannesmann( $185), both of which trade over the counter as American Depositary Receipts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gula, 41, and John Wagstaff-Callahan, 66, rely heavily on computers to analyze 2,500 stocks in 19 markets for their $850 million no-load. For the past several years, the team has screened mainly for high-yielding, relatively unknown small companies that are selling at low prices relative to earnings and asset values. Their largest holdings are in Japan( 20%), the U.K.( 15%) and Germany( 13%). The combination of a bargain-hunting investment style and computer-imposed discipline has paid off the fund 's 238% five-year return ranks it in the top 30% of all international funds, while volatility is in the bottom 10%. <p> More recently, however, Gula and Wagstaff-Callahan have begun to adapt their portfolio to the world 's new economic realities. Specifically, they are looking both for small European companies that are likely to be acquired and for multinational giants such as Siemens and Nestle( ADR OTC, $57.50). Says Gula : " We think that these companies are going to be among the global leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Income. In a fund category dominated by billion-dollar behemoths designed to crank out yield, FPA New Income( 4.5% load) is a $35 million pipsqueak that aims to produce a high total return. Robert Rodriguez, 41, the manager since 1984, generally invests about 75% of assets in staid U.S.-backed mortgage securities and five- to 10-year-term Treasuries. But with the rest of the fund he goes bargain hunting. As much as 7% of it was recently in high-yield corporates that Rodriguez bought at distress prices when government regulators forced savings and loans to dump junk. " With prices so depressed, yields on these bonds are finally compensating investors for their risk, " he says. <p> FPA 's yield, lately 7.9%, is a full percentage point below that of the typical mortgage fund, but the total return is top rank. The fund rose 66% in the past five years, compared with the average gain in its category of 55%. FPA 's risk : 27% below the average. <p> AMEV U.S. Government Securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely because Dennis Ott, 44, the fund 's manager since 1985, made correct interest-rate calls over the past five years. That 's not to say, though, that the 4.5%-load fund yo-yos heavily in and out of the market. Says Ott : " We try to anticipate changes in interest rates and the economy, but we do n't bet the farm. " The fund 's 64% five-year gain to Aug. 1 placed it in the top 20% of government bond funds ; its volatility, meanwhile, ranked in the bottom 30% of the category. <p> Despite the turmoil in the bond market since the invasion of Kuwait, Ott is betting that rates will change little over the next six months. The manager 's next move : some selective trading to shorten the fund 's average weighted maturity from eight to seven years. <p> Vanguard Fixed Income -- GNMA. In the relatively homogeneous GNMA group, this $2.4 billion no-load 's minuscule 0.31% expense ratio( vs. 0.99% at the typical mortgage portfolio) gives the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 47, the head man since 1980, gets a 0.68 percentage point head start.( The thrifty cost structure is typical of other Vanguard funds and helps explain why Sullivan, who also runs Vanguard Investment Grade, is the only manager to direct two funds in the MONEY 20.) With that kind of edge, the fund has been able to provide a 63% total return over the past five years -- compared with 55% for the average mortgage-backed fund -- while holding risk at roughly the category average. <p> Sullivan anticipates a small rise in interest rates as the bond market adjusts to the oil shock, but over the next 12 to 24 months, he expects the sluggish economy to drive rates back below recent levels by three-quarters of a point or so. Accordingly, he has shifted the portfolio into GNMAs with lower payouts, which tend to be more sensitive to interest-rate declines. <p> Lexington GNMA. Like Dennis Ott of AMEV, Lexington GNMA manager Denis Jamison, 43, makes his portfolio maneuvers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fund 's holdings more than once every two years or so, " he says. " The more changes you make, the more prone you are to errors. " But Jamison does trade about 25% of the no-load 's $97 million portfolio fairly often, to keep a hand in the market and perhaps add a bit to his fund 's return. Over the past five years, Lexington is up 59% compared with 55% for the average GNMA fund. <p> Currently most of the portfolio is invested in GNMAs with relatively low payout rates of 8.5% to 9.5%, securities that stand to appreciate more than other GNMAs if rates fall. " We probably wo n't change our stance until we see the yields on 30-year Treasuries drop from about 8.8% now to 7.2%, " says Jamison. At that point, he might shorten maturities and raise the cash level, currently 5%, to as much as 15%. CORPORATE BONDS <p> IDS Selective. High-grade IDS Selective( 5% load) goes where the bond market values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43, currently has 17% of the $1.2 billion fund in government bonds. His view is that the call protection and impeccable credit quality of Treasuries is worth sacrificing about a percentage point in yield compared with high-grade corporates. In addition, if the bond market turns bearish, Goodner can sell his governments fast and raise cash. In short, Selective can be just that : choosy. The fund scored a five-year gain of 66%, better than 95% of funds in its high-grade corporate category, while taking an average level of risk. " The biggest factor in performance is the movement of interest rates. If we think rates are going up, we head for the sidelines, " says Goodner, whose current cash position is a moderately cautious 12%. <p> Bond Fund of America. Abner Goldstine, 59, the MIT-educated economist who heads Bond Fund 's seven-member management team, attributes the $1.6 billion fund 's success to a thoroughly researched, highly flexible investment approach. Goldstine 's crew has scored with fixed-income instruments ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-grown credit research to discover gems overlooked by the rating agencies. The result has been consistent performance that rarely topped the charts but nevertheless clocked an average 10.7% total return over each of the past five years, about 2.4 points a year more than the average corporate bond fund. <p> The 4.75%-load fund 's largest holdings, making up 25% of the portfolio, are U.S. Treasuries and agency issues. But Goldstine and his credit researchers have also been prowling around the ruins of the savings and loan industry for bargain-priced bonds issued by healthy thrifts such as Oakland-based Golden West Financial and Los Angeles-based Great Western Financial. <p> Vanguard Fixed Income-Investment Grade. This $1.1 billion no-load has one of the lowest expense ratios in its class : 0.34% of assets per year. As in Paul Sullivan 's GNMA fund -- he has managed this one since 1976 -- such efficiency helps returns. Result : five-year performance that ranks in the top 20% of high-grade corporate funds. <p> But this fund is not for the faint of heart. The fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ranges between 15 and 25). That should make Investment Grade easily the most volatile of our corporate bond funds. <p> Babson Bond Trust -- Portfolio L. In stark contrast to Vanguard 's Sullivan, Babson portfolio manager Edward Martin, 40, does n't like to gamble with interest rates. " We think trying to guess rates is a futile exercise, " he says. Instead, Martin, who 's been at the no-load 's helm since 1984, keeps his $87 million fund 's average maturity at nine years or so and relies on his own research and economic outlook to locate values in the bond market. Five-year average annual return through July was 10%, better than two-thirds of corporate funds. Its volatility : 17% less than the average corporate fund. <p> Lately, Martin has been leaning toward credit-risk-free Treasuries and government agencies, which constitute almost half the fund 's assets. Among the few corporate bonds he 's currently buying are BBB-rated issues of utility companies, such as Commonwealth Edison and Columbia Gas. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms to so-called event risk -- the sudden financial restructurings that can cause downgrades in credit ratings. MUNICIPAL BONDS <p> Financial Tax-Free Income. Financial 's William Veronda, 44, the $185 million no-load 's manager since 1984, has made money betting on interest rates. By lengthening the maturities in his high-grade portfolio to 24 years and loading up on highly rate-sensitive discount bonds( those selling for less than their face value), Veronda capitalized on falling interest rates over the past five years to rack up a market-beating total return of 70%. The drawback : a volatility among the highest in its class. <p> Anticipating higher rates in the wake of the oil crisis, Veronda has now begun to hedge his bets. He has offset interest-rate risk by hiking his holdings in relatively stable premium munis( those trading for more than face value) from 25% last year to 40% recently. Meanwhile, Veronda is focusing on what he considers undervalued issues in regions with diversified, recession-resistant economies. Two examples, both utilities : Intermountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Safeco Municipal. With a 68% return over the past five years, this $302 million Seattle no-load outgained more than 90% of muni funds while subjecting shareholders to a risk level only slightly above the category average. Steve Bauer, 45, the fund 's manager since 1981, attributes his success to a bargain-hunting investment approach that has led him in the past to put as much as 10% of the fund in BBB-rated grade bonds. Since late last year, however, Bauer says that the yield advantage of medium-grade bonds has been too narrow to compensate for the extra credit risk, and he has kept 88% of his portfolio in issues rated A or better. <p> Ever the bargain hunter, though, Bauer is upbeat about the market uncertainty in the wake of the Kuwait invasion. " What always happens in these situations, " he says, " is that people get : scared and sell bonds cheap. " Reporter associates : Deborah Lohse and Prashanta Misra <p> <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : OUR TOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR YOUR LIFE GOALS STOCK FUNDS TO BUY AND HOLD <p> The equity funds in the MONEY 20 provided exceptional long-term gains, particularly when measured ' against their level of risk. On that basis, each of our talented 10 outpaced at least 80% of the funds in its category, thus receiving a MONEY risk-adjusted grade of A. Despite uniformly excellent performance, though, the funds are not all alike. Those with high P/Es pay premium prices for fast-growing stocks ; those with high yields cushion risk with income. A cash level over 10%, meanwhile, suggests that the fund 's manager is currently cautious about the market. TABLE BOND FUNDS THAT WILL STAND TALL <p> Like the stock funds above, the fixed-income funds in the MONEY 20 met strict standards of excellence. Eight of our 10 bond entries earned A-level honors by placing in the top 20% of their categories on a risk-adjusted basis.( The two B 's -- which outscored 60% of their competition -- rose to the top in categories in which many A-rated funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fund 's volatility, check its maturity and cash level ; low cash and long maturities indicate that a fund is likely to be quite sensitive to interest-rate changes.
