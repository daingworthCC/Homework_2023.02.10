2021641 Joint and muscle strain // Baby-boomers have n't been this concerned about the condition of their joints, it 's safe to say, since the day it rained at Woodstock. As the population bulge hurtles through middle age, it is stumbling, falling, and getting carted off to hospitals in numbers so huge that the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has coined a term- " boomeritis " -for injuries to aging athletes. Sports injuries to people between the ages of 35 and 54 jumped 33% between 1991 and 1998, the Consumer Product Safety Commission found in a 2000 study. In 1998, the study said, more than 365,000 boomers hurt themselves badly enough to require emergency-room treatment. Counting all injuries needing medical attention, the total was more than a million. How big is this problem? A movement by physicians to declare the years 2000 to 2010 the Bone and Joint Decade has been endorsed by the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and the Pope. On a more public level, Michael Jordan has developed a sore knee. He 's 38, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's famous for his devotion to conditioning, and yet His Airness has already had to sit out a game. It 's all pretty hard for baby-boomers to bear. After all, they were the first generation to spend quite so much time in the gym, and their collective effort to stay in shape is regarded as one of the biggest epidemiological events of our time. Now the wear and tear from all that exercise is paying a cruel dividend in the form of overuse injuries : sprains, strains, ligament damage, and especially osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis. Boomers are responding to the problem with all the fatalism and humility you would expect. They are forming lacrosse leagues for seniors. Taking up boxing in midlife. Grabbing bags of vegetables from the freezer to wrap around an inflamed knee and then going out to play another couple of games of basketball. At least that 's what Ira Jaskoll does. " I always Photograph Trainer Tim Grover thinks that he can help Michael Jordan, 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frozen vegetables, " says Jaskoll, 52, who teaches at the B-school of Yeshiva University in New York and plays hoops once a week. Last summer something popped in his knee, and his surgeon told him he should never play basketball again. The idea struck him as absurd. As a 50-year-old, he won a bronze medal at the Pan American Maccabiah Games( the " Jewish Olympics ") playing on the U.S. basketball squad. " I realize there will come a time when I ca n't play any more, " Jaskoll says, " but I 'm not ready to hang " em up. " Jaskoll speaks for his generation, and on the whole it 's a good thing, because earlier generations may have hung up their spikes far too soon, medically speaking-often on the advice of doctors who believed that aging inevitably involved a more or less linear, general decline in physical capacity. Baby-boomers would n't have accepted such an idea even if it were true, of course, and thankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this. People were expecting a progressive limitation, " says Dr. Frank Williams, the scientific director of the American Federation for Aging Research, who is 80 and likes to bike to work at the University of Rochester in Upstate New York. Regular aerobic exercise, for instance, can increase the heart 's capacity and offset the decline in rate that comes with age. " Many people can have the maximum cardiac output of young adults on into their 60s and beyond, " says Dr. Williams. Furthermore, exercise may be one of the best ways to achieve what the baby boom will be looking for next on its demographic journey : what doctors call the compression of morbidity, or the postponement until near life 's very end of aging 's toughest afflictions. " We now realize that many of the physical deteriorations that we commonly attributed to age are attributable to disuse, " says Dr. Barry Franklin, director of cardiac rehabilitation at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. Studies at Stanford University have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who do n't. All this leaves middle-aged people in a curious position. Is it better to keep playing one 's game until the joints give out? Or to cut back on exercise and risk the pathologies of a sedentary life? The medical literature wimps out on this point ; a 2000 study in the Journals of Gerontology concludes, " There is a surprising paucity of literature on sports injuries in older persons. " So the baby-boomers will have to make choices-as they have been doing all along, as the first generation to grow up as " health consumers, " rather than as patients who did what their doctors told them. With this freedom come pitfalls. In a recent Roper poll, 13% of Americans said they got no exercise at all and were hoping the fitness craze would prove a passing fad. For these people, the future has just recently hove into view : Segway. At the other extreme there is the sad story of Eddie Andrade, reported in the LosAngeles Times Magazine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins and one loss, retired to Santa Barbara and kept himself on a fitness regimen so intense that he seemed to be winning the battle with time. Running, swimming, lifting weights, teaching martial arts, and sticking to a strict Pritikin diet, he was as buff in his 60s as he 'd been in his 30s. Then one day, at 65, he went to a seaside cliff above a track where he sometimes trained and put a bullet into his temple. His suicide note explained simply, " Too much pain. " Somewhere between those poles there must be a sensible approach, but even fitness trainers are having to find their way in the dark. When Tim Grover got his master 's in exercise physiology in 1989, he says, " What you did was, you either learned to train the athlete in his prime or you learned geriatric fitness, which is people over 65. " Today he is the trainer on whose shoulders rest the hopes of a generation. That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he uses " two totally different programs " depending on whether an athlete is in his prime or past it. " You 're going from a low-rep, quick type of movement to more reps, lower weights. We 're saying, Okay, your body 's got a lot of wear and tear. Stabilize those muscles. " Jordan, he says, is " in the older guy 's regimen, " and while he wo n't disclose training secrets, he says " we are trying some new techniques. " Assuming Jordan 's knee gets better, this could be fun to watch. Says Grover, tantalizingly : " We should know in a couple of months whether we have found a way to rebuild some of those fast-twitch muscles. " What he 's referring to is the problem of muscle loss, which affects sedentary people at the rate of about 1% a year. Muscles can be rebuilt with weight training and other sorts of exercise, but the tissue that 's restored tends to be of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why geezers play sneaky tennis. There is little disagreement that keeping muscles strong is one of the best ways to stave off osteoarthritis. Modern drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen can reduce swelling once the disease has set in.( WD-40 is not recommended, though doctors report that a disturbingly large number of patients spray the stuff on their joints. Really.) But the best defense is to keep muscles strong enough to prevent joints from getting misaligned in the first place. The problem is, which muscles? " Maybe you do weightlifting for the aesthetics of how you look, " says Peggy Brill, a New York physical therapist who has a practice at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and spends a lot of her time repairing investment bankers. " But if you develop muscles at the expense of your joints, that 's not good weightlifting. My thinking is always, How do you develop your postural strength? Because if your postural strength is strong, then your joints align properly. " Does this sound like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes closed. Teetering is permitted, but you should be able to keep one foot off the ground for 30 seconds. Now try squatting with your heels on the floor. Now drop and give me ten( knee pushups are acceptable if you 're a girl). Now crush a beer can against your forehead. No, sorry : Touch your hands behind your back, one reaching down behind your neck and the other up under your shoulder blade. If you ca n't do those things, even in your 60s, Brill says, you should probably change your workout. Photograph Physical therapist Peggy Brill tricks some of her corporate clients into doing yoga. // And unfortunately, you should probably be doing the very things you are disinclined to do. Most people like to stick with what they 're good at, and that is often the root of overuse injuries. " A lot of the executives here, when I started eight years ago, would never have wanted to do yoga, " Brill says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing yoga. I just had them doing stretch routines, and after they got really good at it I said, You know, that 's yoga. " Ah, yes, ego. Dr. Richard Steadman, the renowned Vail, Colo., knee surgeon, says ego is what drives a lot of patients into his clinic for repairs. " Baby-boomers would n't make the same investments today, for instance, that they made when they were 20 years younger, " Steadman says. " But your exercise is part of your ego, and people have a different approach to exercise than they do to prudent investment. " It is possible, of course, that stem-cell research and other scientific advances will produce new ways to ease creaky joints. A company called Genzyme in Cambridge, Mass., has had success repairing joints by harvesting healthy cartilage cells, culturing them in a lab, and then transplanting them back into knees. But the procedure, called a carticel implant, has worked best in young athletes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in patients with wear-and-tear arthritis, " Dr. Steadman says. " My first advice to most people is to adjust their exercise to fit their knee, and not go through a bunch of surgical procedures to make their knee fit their lifestyle. " Photograph Dr. Frank Williams, 80, is still riding his bike to work most days. // Tim Grover gives the same advice to the elite athletes he trains. " You have to say, Today I 'm only going to play two games of basketball, not three. ' " That 's about how Ira Jaskoll sees it too. He 's decided not to try out for the Maccabiah games again, but he 's still playing basketball, taking his frozen vegetables with him and strapping a brace onto each knee. " I always stretch before I play, " he says, " and then I try to play within myself. It 's that extra game when you get real sore. " But, he adds, " how can you say no if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's what the Woodstock generation will probably have to do if it is to avoid its greatest fear : becoming a bunch of artificial hipsters. <p>
