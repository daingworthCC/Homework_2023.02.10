2004841 Cook the best dishes from Sunset 's $50,000 recipe contest Photograph For originality-a and because we could n't stop eating it-this sweet potato cheesecake took our grand prize. // Thanksgiving dinner tastes a little different in the West than around the rest of the country. The veggies are more likely to be fresh, the dressing might contain anything from sourdough bread to Chinese sausage, and sweet potatoes rarely sport marshmallows. With Safeway as our partner, we held our biggest Thanksgiving recipe contest ever at Sunset this year ; more than 6,500 entries came in. The winners-from all over the West, including Hawaii-reflect our region 's diversity and creativity. The winning dressing is a Southwestern mix of cornbread and chorizo. Our top appetizer is built around wild Northwest salmon. Kabocha squash becomes a serving bowl for vegetables. Fresh herbs are steeped in a cocktail. And sweet potatoes find their way into the grand prize winner, the best cheesecake you 'll ever eat.
