4149441 FROM THE POPULAR SCIENCE ARCHIVES # APRIL 1943 # Battleships ruled the ocean until World War II, when aircraft carriers usurped the lead role in most naval fleets. In April 1943, PoPular Science argued that the Navy still needed battleships -- steel, steam-powered warships armed with big guns -- to protect convoys and fight enemy craft, despite proposals to phase them out. Writer Alden P. Armagnac described a skirmish near the Solomon Islands in which a U.S. battleship, armed with an automatic antiaircraft cannon, brought down 20 Japanese bombers in eight minutes. But Armagnac pointed out that while a battleship 's 16-inch-thick side armor protected it well from gunfire, the ship remained vulnerable to mines and torpedoes and required an escort of flak ships to thwart lurking submarines. The U.S. Navy decommissioned its last two battleships, the USS Wisconsin and USS Missouri, in 1991 and 1992, and replaced them with cruisers and destroyers, which are smaller, faster, and more mane uverable. In 2013, the U.S. Navy will launch its Zumwalt-class destroyer, the most sophisticated warship ever built. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #
