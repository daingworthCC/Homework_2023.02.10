2008441 WHERE FISH GO IN WINTER AND SOLUTIONS TO 7 OTHER NATURAL MYSTERIES // Backpackers are notorious for venturing into the wilderness to contemplate life 's most perplexing questions. Should I marry that guy? Should I quit my job and hike the Pacific Crest Trail? Sorry, we ca n't help with those( though we 've never met a regretful thru-hiker). But toss us a few riddles about the outdoors, like why spiders do n't stick to their own webs, and we have you covered. Herewith, answers to eight of nature 's wildest mysteries. Q : Why do n't spiders stick to their own webs? Turns out Spider-Man 's story is n't all fiction. When the comic-book legend clings to buildings with his hooklike fingers, he 's actually mimicking the technique of his namesake. At the end of each leg, a spider has a toe with three or four tiny claws. While naive insects stumble onto the web feet-first, entangling themselves in the gluelike threads, spiders hook on and navigate with ease. " They hang onto their webs instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arachnid specialist at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson. " And they very rarely crawl onto another spider 's web. They know it 's the home of a predator. " Q : Does moss always grow on the north side of trees? The short answer : Moss grows anywhere it can, so do n't throw out your compass just yet. The long answer : Moss and lichens require more moisture than many other forest plants, so they can help with navigation. In locations that forest ecologists call " pivotal thresholds " -places that get some, but not abundant, precipitation-moss grows only on the north side of trees, where moisture lingers. " It occurs most often in North America in temperate zones, " explains John Bailey, Ph.D., of Northern Arizona University 's School of Forestry. That does n't include perpetually moist environments like the Pacific Northwest, where moss and lichens grow on all sides of trees, or the desert Southwest, where scarce moisture leads to unpredictable, if any, growth patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze? The cold truth is that winter has far less of an impact on creatures that live below the water 's surface than on those that live above it. According to Tom Doolittle, a fish and wildlife biologist on Lake Superior, bodies of water " turn over " in winter so that the warmer water is at the bottom instead of the top. " When a lake surface is frozen, the fish generally seek a strata just above the bottom that offers the best level of oxygen and temperature for their species, " he says. Fish biologists in Alaska report that even in tarns as shallow as 10 feet, fish often find the oxygen to survive. But Doolittle adds that things can get grim if a lake freezes and is then covered with so much snow that light ca n't get through to sustain the oxygen-providing plants on the lake bottom. Fortunately, a complete winter kill is n't a catastrophe. Doolittle says lakes can be repopulated in warmer months by birds flying overhead and dropping fish eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of treeline? Air temperature, says Dr. Bailey. " Most treeline species have evolved to survive well below freezing, " he explains. But extreme cold( below 0degreesF) causes cell damage that stunts or stops growth. Which explains why treeline is much lower at high elevations and at polar latitudes, where the angle of the sun is too slight to provide temperatures necessary for supporting life. In Greenland, for instance, treeline is at sea level. The highest treeline is found near the equator, in the mountains of Ecuador and Peru around 13,000 feet. In North America, the highest is 11,000 feet on Arizona 's San Francisco Peaks. Wind is a secondary factor in determining treeline. The sheer force of hurricane-strength gusts makes it hard for young buds and branches to hang on. " At treeline, " notes Dr. Bailey, " you find the most wind-resistant species, like white bark and bristlecone pine. They 're hunkered down trying to survive without cover. " Q : What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little difference, but do n't tell that to the princess who 's all puckered up. A toad is actually a kind of frog, the classification given to all amphibious life forms that hop as adults and do n't have a tail. Craig Ivanyi, a herpetologist at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson, says the one distinguishing characteristic is the toad 's paratoid glands. Located behind their eyes, these raised, kidney-bean-shaped glands produce and store defensive toxins. Various species of frogs secrete defensive toxins from their skin, but only toads pack them in paratoid glands. " It 's true some toads spend more time on land, but so do some species of frogs, so you ca n't use that to separate them, " explains Ivanyi. And the legend about toads giving you warts? That 's pure fairy tale. Q : Is heat lightning dangerous? This may come as a shock, but there 's no such thing as " heat lightning. " Meteorologist Jeff Renner, author of Lightning Strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't create lightning-only storms do. " When you see a flash in the sky and it 's a hot day, there 's a thunderstorm out there. " Q : Why do birds sing in the morning? Unlike humans who need coffee to spring into action, birds are motivated by sunlight. " Some species require very little light and start singing in the wee hours of the morning, " explains Martha Fischer, a sound archivist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, NY. " Others start singing at a more reasonable hour. " As the morning progresses and the air temperature rises, Fischer says, birds tend to sing less frequently or stop altogether. They then turn their attention to hunting, nest building, and mating. There are exceptions, of course-mockingbirds sing at full tilt in the dead of night, while red-eyed vireos sing all day long. Q : How does wind blow in different directions at the same time? This is a two-part answer. 1) It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can travel in only one direction at a time. 2) It does. That same stream of air can bounce around like a ping-pong ball, ricocheting off the ground, canyon walls, and other natural barriers, its head going in a different direction than its tail, according to Renner. <p>
