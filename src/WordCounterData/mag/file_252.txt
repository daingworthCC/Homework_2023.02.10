2030441 Section : Advisor Sick of being told that everything is bad for you? Here 's an eater 's digest of what you should( and should not) swallow <p> We 're all targets of advice. We get it from friends, relatives and that annoying guy on the bus. Usually we get it without asking, and sometimes, on rare occasions, we take it to heart. And it helps. <p> But there 's a fine line between positive advice and incessant nagging. Consider, for example, the information you 've been hearing lately about the dangers of dining out. Every week you 're told how unhealthy it is to eat this or to eat that. You see it on the news. You read it in the paper. And it 's beginning to wear on you. Even your barber, in between snips, is giving you a detailed lecture on nutrition. Something he read in USA Today said Chinese takeout was bad for you. And Italian food. And Mexican. And deli sandwiches. And popcorn. It 's enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste good and wo n't kill you. <p> We could blame the press for all this alarming stuff. After all, they 're the folks who churn out the bad tidings. But it might help to first ask where they get their information. One of their primary sources is a nonprofit consumer health group called the Center for Science in the Public Interest( CSPI). Once an obscure group existing on subscriptions to its Nutrition Action Health Letter and cash grants from private foundations, the CSPI has now carved out a highly visible niche lambasting restaurant takeout foods, as well as baby food, frozen food and dell sandwiches. Its targets have included fettuccine Alfredo, which it calls " a heart attack on a plate ; Kung Pao chicken( nearly as fatty as four Quarter Pounders, the CSPI says) and Chilies Rellenos, which the CSPI claims has as much saturated fat as 27 slices of bacon. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. <p> And CSPI director Michael Jacobson, Ph.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, posing for cameras while taking a chisel to a 50-pound block of fat or dressing as Tony the Tiger to condemn sugary breakfast cereals. These theatrics have helped the CSPI make the front pages -- and triple its annual revenues over the past 10 years to more than 12 million dollars. <p> To its credit, the CSPI does publish positive, practical health advice in its newsletter. But you rarely ever hear about that. Instead, the hacks on your local nightly news would rather report on the latest health hazard lurking in your fridge or at the local takeout. And now that the CSPI has become the clearinghouse for nutritional grenades, the press has come to expect it, and the CSPI is content to serve it up like morning mush. <p> The question is this : Should you be taking any of this alarming health information seriously? Especially if some of it is coming from a guy in a tiger costume? <p> We talked to many health experts and found that they too are beginning to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telling the public everything is bad, without any positive advice, makes them more inclined to give up and resort to unhealthful eating, " says Judith S. Stern, Sc.D., R.D., professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California at Davis. Even the CSPI 's own research suggests its scare tactics maybe less than effective. In one survey, it found that of those who 'd heard of the CSPI 's work, most agreed the center is performing a valuable service. But less than half actually heeded the advice when dining out. <p> That may be due to the fact that most of us respond better to positive than to negative reinforcement. We 'd rather know what we can enjoy, instead of what we ca n't. Tell us to stop thinking about Heather Locklear, and she 'll pop into our heads and stay there for a long time. The same thing goes if someone tells us to lay off the deli. All of a sudden we want pastrami. <p> So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nutrition experts and asked them to cut through the alarmist hype and offer helpful suggestions about eating out. Here 's what they advise. <p> Indulge occasionally. In the CSPI newsletter, Jacobson writes that " If we had our way, everyone would be dining on whole grains, beans, vegetables and fruit, along with low-fat dairy foods and maybe a little lean meat and poultry : To be sure, a lot of people are eating this way already. But is it so bad if you are n't? <p> " For most of us, it 's more realistic to work certain fatty foods into a well-balanced diet, instead of tossing out every food you have a hankering for, " says Wayne Callaway, M.D., former director of the Mayo Nutrition Clinic. That 's because those hankerings are perfectly natural and should n't be ignored. Satisfy that craving and you probably wo n't need to do it again for a while. <p> " But consistent deprivation wo n't work ; says Edith Hogan, R.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies show that people on deprivation diets often end up bingeing on the very foods they try to avoid. A guilty pleasure now and then serves as a release valve to ease the cravings. " We do n't just eat for health, we also eat for pleasure, " says Hogan. " And you can have both. Your body needs both : <p> Besides, there 's no such thing as a " one size fits all " diet anyway. So do n't kill yourself trying to follow a strict regimen your body is n't prepared to handle. You 're only human. <p> Try many different restaurants. When the CSPI reviews restaurant foods, its methods are accurate but often unfair. In a typical report, many samples of the same food( for instance, a Reuben sandwich) are taken from a number of different restaurants and sent to a lab, where they are blenderized and analyzed. It 's all so frighteningly simplistic. Equal portions of the foods from these restaurants are lumped together-side dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blended into a single unrecognizable, murky glop of indiscriminate calories. It 's not a meal, it 's a mess. But what ends up in the CSPI report is an average figure for fat content, total calories and sodium content. <p> Here 's the problem : While one deli may make a Reuben with plenty of whole-grain bread, lots of relish and sauerkraut and corned beef with excess fat trimmed off, the next might make one with white bread and lard. You 'll never know, however, because the the CSPI comes up with one average number for all its samples, eliminating any range. The CSPI leaves out the variability regular restaurant-goers encounter all the time. <p> So, rather than avoid all restaurants, simply shop around. Check out all the local places that serve, say, Mexican food, and try out a new place each week. Just avoid the obvious fry pits where the restaurant counter is a window on the side of a trailer and the cashier is wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weed out the greasy ones and find the healthier ones, " says Dr. Callaway. <p> When eating out, sample and share. As you read about how unhealthy certain restaurant foods are, you 'll often find that the spotlighted dishes, such as Kung Pao chicken or fettuccine Alfredo, are the most fattening on the menu. And the portions being analyzed are shockingly huge. " Most people already know how fattening these foods are ; says Dr. Callaway. But face it, it 's hard to finish a heaping plate of high-fat food. You might share it, you might leave it, you might even doggie-bag it. You might even shape the stuff left on the plate into a lovely design to impress the help. But you probably wo n't eat as much of the stuff as the CSPI is analyzing. <p> And believe it or not, there are plenty of leaner dishes out there in restaurant-land. The CSPI even lists them in its newsletters, but they 're invariably overlooked by the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just a few of the good ones : <p> * Mexican : The chicken fajitas are fine, with 26 percent of their calories coming from fat. A chicken burrito gets only 36 percent of its calories from fat. Go light on the guacamole and sour cream, and have the Mexican rice as a low-fat side. That will leave room for the frozen margaritas. <p> * Deli : Have the turkey breast with mustard or lean roast beef with mustard. Both are low-fat, provided you do n't slather them with too much mayonnaise or chase them with a chocolate shake. <p> * Italian : Except for impeccably dressed Mafia bosses, who eats Alfredo anyway? Spaghetti with tomato or meat sauce, linguine with red or white clam sauce, even spaghetti with meatballs are all fine. All these dishes have less than 30 percent of their calories coming from fat. <p> * Chinese takeout : Try the Szechuan shrimp( 18 percent of calories from fat), the stir-fried vegetables( 22 percent calories from fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fat) or chicken chow mein( 28 percent calories from fat). And before you order, please refrain from stuffing your face with those deep-fried noodles staring at you from the bowl. Those are quick, painless ways to pile on the fat. And really, they do n't taste that great anyway. <p> Worry about the bigger issues. Sure, you 've heard by now that movie popcorn is high in fat. But so what if it 's greasier than the theater floor? Should you waste time and energy getting all hot and buttery over it? After all, you probably only eat the stuff a few times a year. And when you do order a big tub, you rarely dig through it alone. You share it with your date. Your brother. Your kid sister. The heavy breather behind you. Or, halfway through the box, you toss it on the floor where it belongs or fling it at the screen during particularly maudlin scenes. " To my knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " says Dr. Callaway. <p> But here 's the thing : Worrying about a fatty food you rarely eat steers emphasis away from more pressing matters. " Instead, we should focus on portion size, eating frequency and getting a variety of foods -- which are all simple behaviors to change, " says Dr. Callaway. And since the major reason for obesity is decreased activity levels, he says, better to emphasize the importance of getting a daily jog rather than switching from hot buttered kernels to chocolate raisins at the cinema. <p> Organizations like the CSPI may have the best intentions at heart. " But rather than warn against foods we rarely eat, we should stress the good foods we can enjoy, " says Mary Ellen Camire, Ph.D., associate professor in the department of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine. <p> Jacobson, though, sees value in the CSPI 's approach. " Hopefully these so-called scares generate changes that will make it possible for people not to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying. Or they might simply stop listening. After all, who has n't heard the story about the boy who cried wolf? <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : THE HORROR, THE HORROR : Movie popcorn may be loaded with fat, but how often do you really eat it? <p> By GREG GUTFELD <p>
