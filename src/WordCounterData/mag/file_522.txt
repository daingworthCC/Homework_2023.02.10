4107641 STORY ONE <p> Many weeds now resistant to multiple chemical killers <p> Agriculture 's most effective pesticides are rapidly losing their punch as weeds evolve resistance to the chemicals. With no game-changing alternatives in the pipeline, researchers warn that farmers could soon see crop yields drop and production prices climb. <p> " It 's what Chuck Darwin talked about back in 1850. Organisms evolve in response to selection pressures in their environment, " says Micheal Owen, an extension weed scientist at Iowa State University in Ames. " In essence, the better we get at controlling weeds, the more likely those efforts will select for survivors that do not respond to controls. " <p> In the June 8 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Owen and other researchers describe the rapid rise of herbicide-resistant weeds and a particularly threatening trend : an increasing number of weeds that are simultaneously immune to multiple herbicides. <p> Farmers have battled weeds since the dawn of agriculture. But the arms race changed overnight with the rollout, beginning in 1996, of crops possessing a genetically engineered immunity to glyphosate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roundup. Growers could then use glyphosate repeatedly, all season long, without fear of killing their crops. <p> " No herbicide has ever been used to the extent glyphosate has, " says Stephen Duke of the U.S. Agricultural Research Service in University, Miss. One price has been the rapid evolution of weeds resistant to it. <p> " Today, 98 percent of U.S. soybeans, 88 percent or so of U.S. cotton and more than 70 percent of U.S. corn come from cultivare resistant to glyphosate, " Owen reports. Reliance on these crops - and an accompanying weed-control strategy that employs glyphosate to the exclusion of other herbicides - " created the ' perfect storm ' for weeds to evolve resistance, " Owen and Jerry Green of Pioneer Hi-Bred International in Newark, Del., argue in their new analysis. <p> But the only thing unique to glyphosate - in terms of breeding weed resistance - is the extent of its use. <p> In the same issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Carol Mallory- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herbicide-resistant hybrid goat grass. It is evolving the ability to tolerate the herbicide imazamox in fields planted with wheat that has been bred to be immune to the chemical. Here, the weed scientist explains, resistance traces not to herbicide overuse, but to the spread of resistant genes in the pollen of wheat, the weed 's distant cousin, through interbreeding. <p> The irony, Mallory- Smith says, is that farmers have found the imazamox-resistant wheat such a high performer that many actually apply little or none of the herbicide to which it 's immune. <p> Applying the weed killer would knock out much of the goat grass invading farmers ' fields. But left untreated, the goat grass survives to accept pollen from the wheat - and in so doing, creates hybrids that incorporate its cousin 's resistance. Although farmers can target the hybrid goat grass with other herbicides, doing so risks killing the wheat as well. <p> Weeds immune to one herbicide will generally also prove insensitive to others that employ the same mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential enzyme function in the plant. For some major crops, weeds have already countered most common modes of poisoning, notes Patrick Tranel of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <p> Common water hemp has risen to become one of the most serious weeds in Midwestern corn and soy. In a study also appearing in the June 8 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Tranel 's team reports finding water hemp simultaneously immune to as many as four functional classes of herbicides - including glyphosate 's class. In the March Pest Management Science, the team reported water hemp 's resistance to yet a fifth herbicide group. <p> Water hemp already exhibits immunity to three of the four functional classes of herbicides federally permitted for use on emerging weeds in soy, Tranel notes. The remaining one does n't work well on weeds six inches high or more and is toxic to glyphosateresistant soy. " So, " Tranel says, " I 'm not exaggerating when I say, at least for soybeans, we 're on the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Western Australia in Perth notes that in his country, some weedy ryegrass species " can be resistant to seven different herbicide types, meaning there are almost no herbicides which still work. " <p> Herbicide makers have encouraged farmers to embrace the mantra KISS - for " keep it simple, stupid, " says Jonathan Gressel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. He and other weed scientists now argue that only the opposite approach will stall the growing evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds. Scientists advocate rotating crops on a given field, applying several different herbicides and considering the use of additional physical treatments such as burning or light tillage. Gressel would also go so far as to recommend quarantining fields where resistant weeds initially turn up. <p> Unfortunately, Owen says, farmers think they can continue using simpler herbicide-centered strategies " as they wait for industry 's next silver bullet. " But novel herbicides are not on the horizon, he says, so a diverse approach to weed management must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native water hemp has adapted to herbicides and is overrunning soy and corn fields.
