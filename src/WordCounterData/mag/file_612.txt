While this frequently observed truth becomes more perspicuous as one grows longer in the tooth, most of us will return to and delight in recipes, books or, in a more germane sense, plants we once knew. Each reunion becomes a hallmark of where we have been and who we have become. # To say I have stumbled upon an old passion in Roscoea, a perennial herbaceous genus hailing from Asia, is profoundly incorrect. Though a perusal of my garden and nursery inventory at Heronswood in the mid-1990s reveals an enviable inventory of species and cultivars, it was a genus for which I possessed only passing interest. Additionally, my collection data from botanical forays into Nepal, western China, Sikkim, Vietnam and Bhutan reveal that seed of no less than 12 taxa of this genus were collected during a 15-year period. # When life took a hard left turn in 2006 and we left the shadows of Heronswood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took along a few plants that possessed emotional and botanical substance in equal proportion. One of these was an established container of Roscoea purpurea that I had collected by seed in eastern Nepal in 2002 on a particularly memorable day with friends Bleddyn and Sue Wynn Jones and Jamaica Kincaid. The progeny turned out to be particularly good forms of the species, with claret-colored stems.( Its sister sibling from this collection was later introduced by another nursery under the moniker ' Cinnamon Stick '.) # That summer, when the mauve blossoms of this Roscoea species erupted from 18-inch-tall ruby-red stems, it was very much like meeting a genus for the first time. In an instant, I began to reflect upon those I had grown before, the species I had at one time hoped to grow and, mostly, those I was not yet aware even existed. # The genus Roscoea is in the ginger family, Zingiberidaceae, of which Hedychium, Globba, Cautleya and the culinary ginger( Zingiber officinale) are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems over a prolonged period, though they are individually ephemeral, each lasting for only a day or three. Best described as orchid-like in appearance( and in fact often mistaken for an orchid), the floral structure possesses a curious pollination strategy. As the pollinator enters the floral tube for nectar, two hinged spurs( themselves simply modified stamens) force downward a single tongue-like appendage, carrying both pollen as well as the receptive stigma. It looks quite like a snake darting its tongue. There are few plants that possess such an entertaining and animated process of procreation. # All species are of the colder mountainous regions of the Himalaya and southwestern Asia, and thusly like a cool, humusy and evenly moist soil. The earlier-flowering and smaller, less leafy species will tolerate more sun, while the beefier taxa want some protection from mid-day heat. They all make sensational container plants, though these must be protected during deep freezes. As a whole, the species are fully hardy in USDA Zones 5 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that many are even hardier. Both deer and slugs find them appealing. # The aforementioned R. purpurea is actually among the last to blossom, though perhaps the showiest of the lot. Emerging from the ground very late in the spring, it forms robust colonies to 18 inches in height and shows substantial variation in flower, leaf and stem color. Purple-foliaged forms of this species( such as ' Brown Peacock ') add a longer season of interest, as does a newly released hybrid from England, ' Royal Purple ', with both copper-colored foliage and deliciously rich purple flowers. Certainly the most intriguing color of the entire genus is found in R. purpurea ' Red Ghurka ', which has arresting brick-red flowers. This later cultivar, still relatively rare in commerce( which is meant to say that I have it and you do not), is undoubtedly held most responsible for the recent uptick in interest of the genus as a whole. # The gardening year in Roscoea-speak begins in late March or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Yunnan and Sichuan Province in western China. My own seed collections of this species in 2000 produced 12-inch plants with yellow as well as purple flowers ; in fact the species is highly variable in flower color and can range from deep violet to pure white. It makes an early and beautiful addition to a rock garden in full sun. # Following shortly thereafter is the better known of all species, R. cautleyoides, closely related to and hailing from the same areas as the abovementioned species. It can range in color from white, yellow, purple or pale pink. The yellow forms are the better known( ' Himalaya ' and ' Jeffrey Thomas ') and blossom earlier than the purple forms( ' Purple Queen '). Roscoea cautleyoides ' Kew Beauty ', the showiest, with very large soft yellow flowers, has recently been determined to be a hybrid with R. humeana. # Robust and floriferous, R. auriculata, from Tibet, Bhutan and Sikkim, begins blossoming in mid-July atop leafy green stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn. Though white-flowered forms of this species exist, I have cultivated only the rich purple forms, which I find perfectly good. It possesses enough " stuff " to hold up in an evenly moist perennial border in full sun or light shade. # At the other end of the scale, R. tibetica, from high elevations of Tibet and western China, is a true rock-garden plant or, better yet, one to be used to best advantage in a trough or container. It is the smallest of the species, with leafy rosettes of stems( technically we must refer to these as pseudostems) rising to only six inches. In the midst of the low tufts of foliage arise a long progression of pretty--and pretty small--purple flowers in June through mid-August. # Likewise, R. scillifolia, though regularly available through specialty nurseries, is not likely to set afire the horticultural hearts of our country. The stature of its stems, somewhat taller than R. tibetica, only makes its flowers of either yellow or purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, as my libido for plants that virtually no one else finds remotely ornamental has not lessened in age. As of 2013, R. scillifolia is considered extinct in its wild haunts ; for this reason alone it should be propagated and distributed. # The many recent acquisitions of the genus that most intrigues me is the actual original collection of R. wardii, made by its namesake, Frank Kingdon-Ward, in northeastern India nearly 80 years ago, though not officially described until the early 1980s. The flowers, produced on stems to one foot in height, are of the darkest violet--and will be useful in hybridization work in the future. #
