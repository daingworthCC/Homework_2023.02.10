5009741 <h> The time of day you visit the doctor could be a matter of life and death <p> A new study says ' decision fatigue ' later in the day leads physicians to skimp on giving these two potentially life-saving tests <p> Getty Images/iStockphoto <p> During the 8 a.m. hour, primary-care physicians ordered breast-cancer screenings for 64% of the patients who were eligible for the tests. But at 5 p.m., those same doctors asked for the cancer tests for 48% of eligible patients, a new study says. <p> Your chances of getting screened for cancer depend a lot on whether you visit your doctor bright and early in the morning or later in the afternoon, a new study concludes. <p> During the 8 a.m. hour, primary-care physicians ordered breast-cancer screenings for 64% of the patients who were eligible for the tests. But at 5 p.m., those same doctors asked for the cancer tests for 48% of eligible patients, according to University of Pennsylvania researchers. <p> The same decline happened with colon cancer screenings -- doctors ordered the tests for 37% of the 8 a.m. patients, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordering screenings could be linked to " decision fatigue, " the mental burn-out that makes it harder for people to think through big decisions the farther they get into their day, said the study, published Friday in JAMA Network Open. The decline also could stem from doctors running behind on their appointments, the researchers acknowledged. <p> ' As the day goes on, clinicians may be less likely to discuss cancer screening with patients simply because they have already done this a number of times. ' -- University of Pennsylvania study <p> " As the day goes on, clinicians may be less likely to discuss cancer screening with patients simply because they have already done this( and made other decisions) a number of times, " researchers wrote. Another possibility was that " patients who see their clinician later in the day want to leave sooner and decline a discussion about cancer screening, " researchers added. <p> In a grim twist, it seems the end of the day also affects patients. When doctors ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiving end of those orders complete the cancer screenings at a lower rate. <p> There was sort of midday bright spot as doctors caught up during lunch. Though breast cancer screenings fell to 48.7% at 11 a.m., they climbed up to 56.2% at noon. But then the rates fell again. <p> The University of Pennsylvania study is also a reminder that for all of modern medicine 's technological advances, there 's still a human element that does n't make the best care a guarantee. <p> For example, a previous study showed that patients admitted to hospitals around the holiday season had increased risks of death or readmission. One of the reasons was that many doctors themselves were out of town, celebrating the holidays. <p> Researchers at the university 's Perelman School of Medicine and the Wharton School sifted through two years of data from 33 primary care practices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with around 19,000 patients eligible for breast cancer screenings and 33,000 patients eligible for colorectal cancer screenings. <p> Almost 600,000 Americans died from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control and Prevention. <p> Past research by the same study team spotted waning flu vaccinations as the day went on, dropping from about 44% to 32%. <p> To fix the issue, " nudges " were tacked onto the system asking whether doctors wanted to accept or decline an order for a flu shot. Doctors who got the nudges prescribed flu shots at increased rates compared to doctors without the reminders. <p> " Our new study adds to the growing evidence that time of day and decision fatigue impacts patient care, " said Dr. Mitesh Patel, the director of the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit and an assistant professor of Medicine. <p> " In past work, we 've found that nudges in the electronic health record can be used to address these types of gaps in care, which we suspect will be the case here, " Patel said. <p> Intraday Data provided by FACTSET and subject to terms of use.
