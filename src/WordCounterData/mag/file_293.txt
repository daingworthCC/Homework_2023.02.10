2035141 You will start out standing Proud to steal her anything she sees. You will end up peeking Through a keyhole down upon your knees. -- Bob Dylan, " She Belongs to Me " OR YOU WILL END UP FACEDOWN On the floor of a cheap motel in the desert, with no pulse and no future, your bloodstream a sludge of the pills you stole from her to seek the solace she would n't give you, your next stop a refrigerated slab, but it will have been worth it because you did n't grow old and die of heart failure ; you died young because your heart worked all too well. I was a young journalist investigating the grim motel-room suicide of another young journalist, a Time magazine correspondent with a jones for F. Scott Fitzgerald and an obsession with a woman who might have stepped out of his pages -- a woman as maddening and beautiful as Nicole Diver or Daisy Buchanan -- when my initial conception of what a Dangerous Woman is began to coalesce. In fact, I can recall the moment it crystallized with an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time guy to his sordid fate on the motel-room floor, I 'd found myself in the Beverly Hills Hotel suite of one of the three most beautiful women in the world. Such was the accolade Vogue had just bestowed upon British actress Sarah Miles, and as I sat face-to-face with her, watching her eyes well up with tears, it was hard to disagree. There was in her bearing -- in addition to her beauty -- a striking fusion of English-rose aristocratic delicacy and the indelicate vocabulary of Lady Chatterley 's gamekeeper. Those crystal tears that had begun to pool in Sarah 's eyes as she spoke of the poor dead Time magazine fellow to whom she 'd given so much only magnified the magnetic power of her eyes. I began to understand the obsession that had taken the Time guy from a room in this hotel to his death in her motel room in Gila Bend, Arizona. It had happened fast : One day, he 'd interviewed Sarah here in the Beverly Hills Hotel ; the next thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life to follow her around the world in an ill-defined role somewhere between personal manager and love slave.( Sarah said that there was no actual sex involved.) He saw her through the gauzy lens of Gatsby and Tender Is the Night and made the mistake of following her to a film-set location in the Arizona desert, where he seethed while she danced with rodeo extras, and he tried to sedate himself with pills while she watched an Oriental masseuse give Burt Reynolds a rubdown.( The masseuse herself told me it was an innocent, holistic thing.) He died ignominiously, lurking in her motel room, waiting in vain for her to return from the after-midnight massage session with Burt. The coroner said it looked like a suicidal drug overdose but pointed to a mysterious " star-shaped wound " on the back of the head of his corpse. By the time I 'd tracked down Sarah at the Beverly Hills Hotel, wild speculation reigned in Hollywood over how Sarah 's obsessed Gatsby wanna-be had become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance for me that afternoon -- a performance highlighted by misty eyes and long, searching glances designed to establish our mutually empathetic natures -- was that she had been deeply misunderstood in the whole affair : that her fault, if any, was that she had been too giving to the unfortunate Time scribe, who had misinterpreted her generosity and pity as love. It was just her nature, she said ; it was the same thing that had happened with the other two people who 'd killed themselves when they felt rejected by her. Mesmerized as I was by her eloquence and her eyes, the last little piece of information did register : Two other people killed themselves over her? She told me about the woman who jumped and the man who gassed himself in her oven. They were n't romantically involved, but -- like the dead man in her motel room -- they made too much of her ; they took advantage of her giving nature. They did n't realize she was " just an ordinary girl. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with visions of gas pipes and smashed bodies and star-shaped wounds doing a sinister gavotte in my head, that a rudimentary definition of the Dangerous Woman began to take shape in my mind : A Dangerous Woman is one who explains the three dead bodies of her obsessed admirers by describing herself -- sincerely, in a deeply heartfelt way -- as an ordinary girl who has the misfortune of being too giving. This was, I will now readily concede, a callow and youthful vision of dangerousness, one seen through the lens of Fitzgerald heroines and film noir femmes fatales, which combined to define the Dangerous Woman for the first half of the twentieth century. The Dangerous Woman as a synthesis of Keats 's Belle Dame sans Merci( a favorite of F. Scott 's) and Raymond Chandler 's Enigmatic Dame Without Mercy. Part Nicole Diver, part Veronica Lake. In fact, the diver and lake images speak to the question, suggesting unfathomable depths, deep currents that engulf those who venture in, pulling them down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal ecstasy known as the Rapture of the Deep. A rapture that almost always signals the Big Sleep to follow. Such, then, is the traditional notion of the Dangerous Woman, the traditional male literary vision that dates back to the Homeric era, the woman as both Siren and Circe, Lilith and Delilah, seductress and devourer ; as Shiva-like dissolver of identity ; the woman as eternal enigma, baffler of Freud, destabilizing mystifier, one-way ticket to madness and self-destruction. Can such a vision have any validity, any future, in the nineties, in the aftermath of sexual revolution, feminism, therapeutic culture, and Prozac? In fact, what seems to be going on as the decade heads downhill to the millennium is an interesting, contradictory dynamic in the development of dangerousness. On the one hand, you have women embracing cinematic images of dangerousness that take that one little extra step beyond sex to violence -- you know, Thelma &; Louise, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, Linda Fiorentino in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men, " You want danger, you think danger is something you can toy with, something to give a little frisson to your ego, ratchet the sexual excitement up a bit, keep you interested? We 'll show you real danger, the kind you do n't wake up from. " On the other hand, the nineties are in so many ways a risk-avoidance decade -- a calculating, careerist, cautious decade when safe sex has given rise to safe romance as well, when a wild, dangerous fling is less likely to mean betrayal, bodily fluids, and infidelity than, say, shifting your IRA into one of the slightly less risk-averse Fidelity mutual funds. Dangerousness seems out of place. So perhaps now is a good time to take another look at the whole concept, at the different ways men and women define it, and to reexamine some of its mythical, stereotypical embodiments. Beginning with the question of whether dangerousness itself is in danger, if the Dangerous Woman -- the real rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure, you have angry Gen-X singers like Liz Phair and Alanis Morissette threatening to slit their wrists or your wrists and invoking Lorena Bobbitt for credibility. Sure, there 's always Courtney Love. But on the other hand, you have the Prozac factor : the way that a lot of women who were once defined as dangerous types or had the potential to become dangerous types -- the artist, the intellectual, the rebel -- are likely, after the first breakdown in college, to be put on Prozac or some other medication to " stabilize " them. Which might save their lives and spare them pain, but which makes them less dangerous, not just to men but to authority, conventionality, order in general. Is dangerousness doomed by pharmaceutical damage control? I put this question to Prozac princess Elizabeth Wurtel, who emphatically disagreed and suggested that Prozac can make certain women more dangerous, can be a kind of secret enabler of dangerousness : " It allows for people to seem perfectly fine at first, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on you -- so men do n't really know what they 're getting into. It 's a bait-and-switch kind of thing. Besides, " she said, shifting into high gear, " in a full million years of trying, men have not managed to wipe out women 's dangerous impulses. Do n't worry, it 's not gon na happen because of Prozac. It 's : like tuberculosis : You know, they found antibiotics for it, but then new mutant strains develop. Dangerousness is stronger than antidepressants. " New mutant strains of dangerousness : The concept is intriguing, suggesting the behavioral equivalent of Ebola emerging from the hot zone of the female imagination. Would the Linda Fiorentino character in The Last Seduction qualify as one of the new variants, with her novel combination of casually calculated predatory sex and coldly commercial homicide? I know a glamorous graduate of the Yale department of comparative literature who told me she found Linda 's performance " just so empowering. " Linda 's appeal to women is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out dangerousness in the first place. Why, after one or two experiences with women who, if less literally homicidal than Linda F, are equally dangerous to stability, peace of mind, sanity -- emotional killers -- do they come back for more? There 's one obvious answer, of course : The intensity of their dangerousness suggests a corresponding intensity of their sexuality. But there may be more to it than that. The answer to the enigma may be embedded in the flip side of the Yale woman 's delight in the " empowerment " that dangerousness offers women. For men, the real attraction may be the thrill of disempowerment. Disempowerment : Think about it. Does n't it take more nerve to give up control? Real men, by this estimation, are n't control freaks ; they 're loss-of-control freaks. Not the tame simulacrum of loss of control that, say, a roller coaster offers ; more like entering the Indy 500, only giving the wheel to a Dangerous Woman -- riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about her own survival, much less yours. Disempowerment : " Why do men want Delilahs? " the acutely observant essayist Phillip Lopate asked rhetorically. " Why is the Bad Woman, the deceitful betrayer in all her film noir guises, " so magnetically attractive? Yes, there are the conventional reasons, Lopate conceded : " Her treacheries are exciting in an operatic... way, they keep you feeling alive and angry, and anger is an aphrodisiac. " But he also suggested that some of the attraction has to do with forms of willed disempowerment : " Because one yearns to be swept away by a passion stronger than one 's reason, which can only be proven if it goes against one 's interests, because by losing control one can turn around later and blame her, she tempted me, she snatched away my willpower... because you who have hurt women so often dream of being a victim, of being punished for your crimes. " The latter rationale is an interesting one : Disempowerment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more cynically) the Dangerous Woman as a privileged white male 's ticket to achieving finally the one contemporary status symbol he 'd otherwise be denied -- victimhood. Although, interestingly enough, another guy I spoke to, who happened to be a black male, also spoke of his attraction to Dangerous Women in terms of willed disempowerment, albeit not in terms of guilt but in the metaphoric sense of edgy sex game. " What Dangerous Women offer has something to do with loss of control, " he says. " They sometimes act out of control, but they 're not really. It 's the maddening unpredictability that gives them control over you. You 're not in physical danger, but you are their captive. With a Dangerous Woman, it 's like you consent to being tied up, not literally, necessarily, but you 're in this place where you 're at her mercy and you do n't know if she 's safe. It does n't feel safe, or maybe it plays with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to something there : " Boundary issues " are the clich du jour in the therapeutic culture of the mid-nineties. The weight of therapeutic rhetoric is all about making sure you establish your sacred boundaries so nobody violates you. But being locked up inside those boundaries can be a bit boring, so maybe we welcome someone dangerous enough to rip open the barbed wire we 've fenced ourselves in with. Not all women buy this argument. There are some, like my friend Lauren, who argue that men are really talking through their hats when they say they want Dangerous Women, because when they find one, they just ca n't handle it, particularly when it comes to sex. Lauren has been dangerous in her time : A deceptively seductive yet innocent-looking blond, smart and knowing, she has strong feelings about men who say they like dangerousness. " I prefer to call it intensity, she says. " Men always say they want real intensity, particularly in bed, but if you really show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She talked about the way the male vocabulary for dangerousness in women so often misses the reality she sees. And so, as an educational public service to men, here is what one Dangerous Woman thinks is really going on : WHEN A GUY SAYS... -- WHAT HE REALLY MEANS IS " She 's too neurotic. " -- " She 's smarter than me. " " She 's too intense. " -- " She 's more interesting than me. " " She 's too difficult. " -- " She 's more independent than me. " " She 's too out of control. " -- " She 's not under my control. " " She 's too dangerous. " -- " She 's braver than me. " THINK THERE 'S A LOT OF TRUTH THERE. You have to concede that it is more difficult for a woman to be dangerous than a man : There 's less of a safety net. For men, dangerousness is a style, a pose, one they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commitment -- it 's almost impossible to go back. So let us now praise Dangerous Women, praise them for their daring, praise them for their disempowering independence, their intoxicating difficulty. Let us praise them by reappraising some of the stereotypes through which they are viewed. Beginning with the Dangerously Intense Intellectual. Which will really, first, call for us to dispose of the Woody Allen false stereotype. While Joe Eszterhas has taken enormous heat for the image of intellectual women he 's created( scratch a successful novelist like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, or a successful psychologist like Linda Fiorentino in Eszterhas 's Jade, and you 're bound to find an ice-pick-wielding lesbian serial killer or an insatiable, high-priced hooker), I 'd argue that it is not Eszterhas, the over-the-top vulgarian, but Woody Allen, the Sensitive Artist, who has done more profound damage to the image of intellectual women. Because his distorted caricature of the smart woman as a dithering, stuttering ditz( essentially Woody himself in drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own characters with) has been so widely disseminated and imitated that it has become the image of the intellectual woman for the vast majority of Americans who have never met a real one. Backhanded proof of the nearly complete bankruptcy of Woody 's take on smart women is the presence in one of his films of perhaps the only exception to the cliche he 's confected, the one instance of the genuine article, the one that comes closest to capturing what dangerously brilliant women are like in real life : Jessica Harper in Stardust Memories. What made her different, what Woody 's other neurotic women lacked, was the lightly worn aura of immense self-possession. A kind of casual but deeply knowing self-possession able to coexist with a brooding intensity at the core, a knowingness that bespoke an easy familiarity with a realm of deep truths both intellectual and sexual beyond Woody 's( and your and my) ken. Tall, thin, intense, with enormous dark eyes and( I do n't know how else to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sarah Lawrence Aesthete. She was the Girl in the Black Raincoat. The mercurially provocative literary critic Leslie Fiedler once published a collection of short stories under the title The Girl in the Black Raincoat. He 'd asked a number of writers to produce stories that would somehow respond to and evoke that one central, compelling image. He did n't have to add another word. Aficionados hear the phrase and can conjure up the whole history : the early ballet training ; the horses ; the wild youth that left her jaded by the time she enrolled in Sarah Lawrence ; the shattering affairs with the Sorbonne professor, the Harlem jazzman, the tragic, dying Jewish composer -- all by the time she graduated. The indelible image of her in the black raincoat, collar up in the mist of one too many mornings. She 'd been there and done that, and she felt the weight of her disillusion with all the men who could not see beyond her French-film-actress looks. She takes no pleasure in breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything anymore. But at least she has her work, her Art. Ah, the arts. Let us pass quickly over the many danger areas here. Too many painful memories : One is always aware of playing second fiddle to whatever demanding muse is the real love of the woman in question, a source of intensity, challenge, and magnetism that you, my friend, are unlikely to equal. Bob Dylan seemed to know whereof he spoke when he wrote, " She 's an artist, she do n't look back. " Yes, as he put it, " She can take the dark out of the nighttime, " but yes, also, as he added, she can " paint the daytime black. " You are trifling with higher powers, with chthonic forces. Dancers have been my downfall in the past : I have lost my heart to women who preferred to have theirs broken by the stern discipline and demands of Merce Cunningham, George Balanchine, even Ronald McDonald.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between dancing in a Ronald McDonald traveling show for children and performing for adult children in a topless " trampoline dance " club in New Jersey -- to support her art, of course.) Redheads : Here we have another category of unjustly maligned and deeply misunderstood Dangerous Women. I will never forget the day in that Texas prairie town when the DA, a crime-bustin ' ', gun-totin ' fellow who made a point of showing me the machine gun he kept in the trunk of his sports coupe, confided to me the special place redheaded women had in his heart -- and in the death-penalty phase of the criminal-justice system in west Texas. He 'd never lost a murder trial, he said, and when it came to picking juries for capital cases, he always tried to get redheaded women on his panel. Why was that? I asked him. " Because they 're just mean, " he said enthusiastically. " I love " em on the death-penalty phase. They want those dudes to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake here that might -- for better or worse -- save the lives of scores of convicted murderers. The DA was ignoring the fact that there are two distinct types of redheads. Sure, there are the ones with fiery tempers, who will cheerfully send killers to the chair and just as cheerfully slash all your clothes to ribbons, put pinholes in your condoms before running off with your best friend. But there is a different, more externally subdued and yet, to my mind, far more dangerous type : the Pre-Raphaelite redhead. This is not the Lucille Ball comic-spitfire redhead, not the Rita Hayworth redhead siren ; this is the pale, ethereal redhead type, the copper-gold, strawberry-blond type that, geneticists say, has the true coloration of the genetically pure strand. A type often associated with the swanlike grace of the ballet dancer, the aesthetic attunement of the musician or artist. This version of redhead -- the DA would learn to his dismay -- is, if anything, empathetic to a fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere mortals, likely to have spent several years on a macrobiotic( or otherwise microscopic) diet. And reluctant to kill any animal for food, much less for Texas justice. Poetic and sympathetic on the surface though they may be, these are perhaps the most dangerous redheads of them all. They may not vote to execute a killer, but they will leave in their wake legions of men who want to kill themselves. They do n't radiate the obvious danger signals ; their danger lies in their spiritual impenetrability -- they exist on a higher, more lofty plane, although when they are aroused, their fire can blaze up into a terrifying conflagration : Think Sissy Spacek in Carrie. Let us now shift from the punitive side of the criminal justice system -- dangerous redheads as hanging jurors -- to the other side : Outlaw Women. As someone who grew up resenting authority and conventionality( suburbia made me that way), I 'd been attracted for as long as I can remember to women who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social order -- Joan Arc, the witches of Salem, Emma Goldman. So I prepared( although I was not really prepared) to be swept away by the erotic impact of Faye Dunaway 's fusion of criminal and sexual transgressiveness in Bonnie and Clyde. Which probably set me up for my even more intense and foolish romantic fixation : fugitive Weather Underground bombing suspect Bernardine Dohrn. The supreme romantic image of my somehow misguided youth was Bernardine 's face on her FBI wanted poster( a picture that will always be on my personal Ten-Most-Wanted List). It may be a sixties thing, maybe you had to be there, but when that image -- fugitive Bernardine with her shining, **25;113;TOOLONG looks and her heavy-revvy black leather biker jacket -- began appearing in post offices, it defined romantic dangerousness for me. Almost everyone else who appears on a wanted poster looks craven and bitter. But not our heroine, whose incandescent eyes burned with the ardent, clear, gemlike flame of political passion, or -- as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed Love. I know, I know : The tactics were counterproductive. The rhetoric was insane.( The notorious celebration of the Manson gang can still make me wince.) But she, they, were out there in a realm of pure unmediated rage. And I still want to defend her from the distortions that have misrepresented what her underground adventure was about. The Weather Underground( an adventurist faction of SDS) never sought to harm people, only property.( It called its bombings. Armed Propaganda.) The only ones who died from its efforts were its own members, in that horrible townhouse explosion. But the real story, the full story, has never been and may never be told : how after that fiasco, Bernardine and the other women in the weather Underground collective took over from the amateurish men, whipped it into shape to pull off spectacular acts of " Armed Propaganda, " and then succeeded in defying and eluding the single largest manhunt( ironic word) in FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an extraordinary feat of skill and bravado that puts mythical male outlaws to shame. A group of women grad students beat the FBI They turned themselves in years later, and only after the FBI men who had futilely pursued them had been tried and convicted for using illegal methods in their manhunt. I always find it amusing when I hear people referring to Madonna or Sharon Stone as Dangerous Women. I think of Bernardine Dohrn 's wanted poster, and I have to laugh. Still, I would have to say that in the hierarchy of dangerousness, far more dangerous than Bad Girls are genuinely Good Ones. There 's a line in a Graham Greene novel in which a character remarks that the ultimate seductiveness in a woman is goodness. That stopped me in my tracks. First of all, let 's face it : Badness has become so obvious, so five-minutes-ago these days, it can hardly be considered dangerous anymore. Badness : We 've been there, we 've done that. It 's hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not goody-goodness, not goody-two-shoes goodness, but a kind of transcendent, antinomian, instinctive, spiritual rightness -- there lies true danger. In fact, if I had to name the single most Dangerous Woman I ever encountered -- the great unrequited love of my youth -- it would be one who was dangerous because of her maddening goodness. Her name was Sally Kempton -- at least it was before she changed it to honor some Hindu goddess. But when I first met her, she was a goddess of a different sort : a bohemian goddess, a Downtown Intellectual goddess. She was, first of all, the daughter of Murray Kempton, a writer who was( and still is) a god to me. So I suppose it was inevitable that I would worship Sally from afar, as I did from the moment I was first introduced to her, when we both were fledgling writers. Of course, she was never really a fledgling ; she always had an effortless sophistication, a way of tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only you in an impossibly intimate bond of understanding that excluded the rest of the dim-witted world. It 's also true that she had dazzlingly golden hair and the most powerful hypnotic, clear blue eyes I 'd ever encountered. There were moments -- eternities, it seemed -- when I would share the slow old elevator in a loft building with her, and she would permit me to gaze hopefully and helplessly into her eyes, and I felt transported to a finer, truer realm of being than I 'd ever glimpsed before. It was this spiritual quality that got me, this sense that she could have had fame, literary success, but that she saw through the vanity of it all, the ambition, the striving for worldly success. She had all that early on ; she 'd scored high-profile controversial coups with her intense and eloquent essays about feminism and her family( for Esquire in particular). She had no shortage of ardent male admirers. In fact, it was my impression that almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her. But it soon became clear that as far as men went, she could have whomever she wanted but found it hard to take any of them seriously. Because they just did n't understand she was after bigger game. She did n't need the admiration of men ; what she want was the admiration of God. She was that most Dangerous Woman of all, the one who wants to be a saint. Fall for her and your rival will be not some schmo with a better line but the Almighty Supreme Being. I sensed something of this, and so I was n't as shocked as many were when she abruptly decided to give it all up, the men, the writing, the goddesslike stature in Manhattan, in order to become a celibate devotee of a swami named Muktananda, who made his home in the Catskills and gave his blessing by bopping his followers on the head with an oversize ostrich feather. I was n't surprised ; I always felt her supernal goodness destined Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she would n't stay with it, that she 'd lose interest in a life devoted to incessant repetitive chanting as way of achieving communion with God, a life devoted to a shaven-headed, orange-robed **26;140;TOOLONG guru. Years later, when it turned out that Swami Muktananda had not practiced the celibacy he preached, when he became the center of one of the perennial sexual scandals that seethe beneath the celibate surface of the guru industry, I was not surprised. I knew that Sally was not personally involved, although I suspected she might have driven the swami to distraction just by her shining, seductive presence, her elusive, ungraspable Dangerous Goodness. But I knew she would not have been tempted by him, by a mere god-man. That, if anything, she as saving herself for God Himself. And that if God was smart, He 'd better watch out -- the Big Guy, Vishnu, whatever He calls Himself in Hindu, just might find Sally the kind of danger even He could n't handle @ @
