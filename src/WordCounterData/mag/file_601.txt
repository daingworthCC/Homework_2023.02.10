4140641 FEEDBACK # Comments, " likes, " and tweets # Re : " In Search of the ' Better Angels ' of Our Future " by Kenneth B. Taylor, November-December 2012 # Submitted by Mitchell Gordon( via e-mail) : One ideology did emerge in the last half century : the New Age Movement. Its disciples( New Agers, the Aquarian Conspiracy, etc.) recognize the coming of age of the human race, the emergence of a faith that is full spectrum, and new politics and a philosophy that are world embracing in scope. It may take a few hundred years, but the New Age is the next civilization. It aligns science and spirituality and does not surrender one to the other. # Taylor would be wise to build his foundation not on the girders of " religion for atheists, " leaving a spiritual vacuum. Better he should embrace our global heritage with all the power of harmony and understanding that the New Age provides. #
