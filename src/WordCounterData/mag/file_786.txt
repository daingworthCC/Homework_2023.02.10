4180341 <p> It was the start of what would become the NFL 's largest national anthem protest to date. <p> This is the anatomy of how it happened. <p> It started simply enough. McCourty 's teammates told him they wanted to figure out a way to join the national anthem protests that started with Colin Kaepernick last season and have continued into this preseason. McCourty was all-in. The group talked, and over the span of several days, they decided what they wanted to do. <p> The group next went to head coach Hue Jackson to tell him of their intentions. On Monday, the day of the Browns ' preseason contest against the Giants, Jackson approved. <p> " Do what you think is right, " he told them. <p> The group came to a decision hours before the game. <p> " We decided to take a knee and say a prayer for peace between all Americans, " McCourty said. <p> That part of the protest, which stands as the largest so far among NFL players, often has been lost among media and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to pray for peace. <p> " We believe that through our actions, we can bring change, " McCourty said in an interview with B/R. <p> " Americans come from all types of different backgrounds, " he continued. " Black or white, rich or poor, immigrant or not, from wherever you come from or live, we want the same thing. We are all Americans, and we wanted to make sure people understood what Colin 's original message was all about. <p> " A lot of us, and a lot of people in football, were furious about what happened in Charlottesville. As NFL players, we have the power to remind everyone that we are all Americans. We should n't be pitted against one another. " <p> Follow protest developments throughout the NFL season by downloading the new B/R app. <p> McCourty, quarterback DeShone Kizer, offensive tackle Shon Coleman, punter Britton Colquitt and offensive lineman Marcus Martin were all around them, putting a hand on their shoulders. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players are just like the rest of us. They watch and care about events happening in the country outside of their work. Before their protest, Browns players had talked extensively about some of the things happening in the United States recently, including the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a woman was killed when a car drove into a crowd of counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally. <p> The Browns ' decision to take a knee was a brave act. But that is only part of the story. The other part -- about what will happen in the future -- is equally important to know. <p> NFL protests are growing, and they have the potential to do so exponentially. That is the next, new front in the Kaepernick saga, who for so long was so alone. Fans, coaches, front office executives, owners and the commissioner will have to grapple with that. <p> Scott Eklund/Associated Press <p> The attempt to squash Kaepernick backfired, McCourty said. A movement, partly based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump 's vitriolic rhetoric, is exploding across NFL locker rooms. <p> Several players from both conferences told me they expect anywhere from 15 to 25 of the league 's teams to have some type of demonstration on opening weekend. <p> " We can bring change and raise awareness, " McCourty said. " A lot of players have been wanting to do something but just did n't know how to handle things. <p> " Then a lot of us saw what happened with players protesting in Philadelphia. When Malcolm Jenkins protested and Chris Long protested, and we saw what Michael Bennett did in Seattle, a lot of us thought, ' It 's time to do something. We just ca n't sit still and watch this without doing something. We need to act. ' " <p> He added : " You 're going to see more players do this. It continues to grow around the league. " <p> Then, perhaps in one of the most powerful moments of the Kaepernick story, the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( via USA Today 's For the Win) about putting her husband 's decision in the proper context. Erica Harris is black and DeValve is white. <p> McCourty made it clear that what the Browns were doing -- and may continue to do -- was not about disrespecting the flag, police or military. It was n't even necessarily about politics. It was about using the high profile of players and the sport to draw attention to various social issues. <p> Mitchell Leff/Getty Images <p> One day after the Browns kneeled, the Buccaneers had a team meeting with head coach Dirk Koetter to discuss their own demonstration plans. <p> " Coach opened it up about the national anthem and guys protesting and sitting down, letting us know that we can do what we want, " cornerback Vernon Hargreaves said, per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times. " He let us know how he felt, and then he opened up the whole team room to anyone who had anything to say : Stand up and preach your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intertwined for the near future. Whether you agree with the players or not, protest is now a fact of NFL life. <p> In many ways, it was symbolically appropriate for the Browns to have helped spark a new wave of demonstrations. Four players broke the NFL 's color barrier in the 1940s, and two of them -- Marion Motley and Bill Willis -- went to the Browns. Legendary coach Paul Brown brought them there. <p> Now comes McCourty and these Browns. <p> It 's possible the Browns sent this story in a new direction because of a few more brave NFL players. <p> So, what happens next? <p> " We 're still figuring it out, " McCourty said. " But I think everyone agrees the protests are something that in the NFL wo n't be going away any time soon. " <p> Mike Freeman covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.
