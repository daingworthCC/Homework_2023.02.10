2017441 // RENWICK GALLERY, SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM / WASHINGTON, DC MARCH 31-AUGUST 20,2000 It is always a potential cause for celebration when a new program gets launched, particularly at the national level, where it can attract the attention of the public and the cognoscenti alike. " The Renwick Invitational : Five Women in Craft " inaugurated a biennial series dedicated to exploring " the many facets of American craft, " according to Kenneth Trapp, the Renwick 's curator-in-charge. This first exhibition featured the basketry of Mary Jackson, the carved porcelain and wood objects of Jane Jacobson, the metalwork of Myra Mimlitsch Gray, the jewelry of Sondra Sherman and the fiber work of Consuelo Jimenez Underwood. The show 's focus on five artists allowed for relative depth, and it was possible to note a strong conceptual break between Jackson and Jacobson, who expand the conventions of their fields, and Gray, Sherman and Underwood, who subvert theirs. Yet certain commonalities brought cohesion. All the artists emphasize a personal connection to their art making and explore the metaphoric possibilities of their imagery, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Carolina, honors the traditional basketry techniques and designs of her African-American forebears with materials found in nature. Each basket represents a search for personal discovery and growth and is likely to induce a trancelike state in the viewer. While her deceptively simple baskets retain their functionality, subtle transformations turn them into complex sculptures. In Open Vessel with Sweet Grass Spray, 1997, a strand of sweet grass breaks out of a coil, extending outward in a sweeping flourish. In other works, she elongates the handles, flattens the vessel or adds French knots as accents. Jacobson has devoted much of the last five years to exploring the Japanese netsuke tradition. Her deftly sculpted objects, inspired by her native rural Minnesota, capture ephemeral moments in nature. In Daylily and Snowy Tree Cricket, 1996, the diminutive scene is exquisitely rendered, the staccato carving of the insect alighting contrasting with the smoother, more sensual treatment of the flower. As with haiku poetry, a sense of effortless spontaneity masks a labor-intensive process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at SUNY New Paltz, utility is neutralized and becomes the basis for her critique of traditional luxury tableware. By encasing such household items as a sugar bowl and creamer, or framinga silver-plated spoon split into scissors, Gray encourages the viewer to probe her transmutations with the mind as well as the senses. While commenting on the daily rituals assigned to women -who often have been deemed possessions themselves-Gray draws attention to the beauty intrinsic to her found objects. Equally radical in its reinterpretation of tradition is the narrative jewelry by Sherman, from Rhode Island, in which the promise of corporeal stimulation leads to intellectual awakening. Her wide-ranging references include nature, as evidenced in shimmering waterfall necklaces of gold, silver, garnets and glass beads. Other works address gender issues and the vicissitudes of love. Venus and Cupid, 1991-93, counterposes two contrasting pendants with a copy of a Northern Renaissance portrait of the mythological pair, all set in a sensual and sophisticated box. Underwood, a Californian, takes on a field dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflicting identity of hyphenated Americans and their invisibility in the eyes of the general population. At times this strident message nearly overwhelms the aesthetics of her atmospheric pictorial weavings. In the layered Virgen de los Caminos, 1994, barbed wire and caution signs associated with border crossings suggest issues of separation and exclusion, while images of the Virgin Mary and floral patterns underscore the strength of the artist 's Latino heritage. Laying the foundation for subsequent successes, " Five Women in Craft " was challenging, though at times it seemed disjointed, given the range in sensibility and association of the artists, and an installation that grouped their works inconsistently. Yet each body of work possessed tremendous vitality, paving the way to a larger awareness of what craft is today and what it can be in the future. -SARAH TANGUY We invite submissions to " Gallery, " a timely pictorial survey of exhibitions.
