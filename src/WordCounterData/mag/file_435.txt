4071241 In her 90-year-old, colonial-style Indianapolis home, Sara Snow easily rattles oft how she religiously follows the tenets of green living. Dressed in pants made of wood pulp and an organic cotton shirt, this up-and-coming eco-friendly expert is among the true tree-huggers, " greenies " --her words--who do everything they can to live lightly. <p> All the food she and Ryan, her husband, buy is organic or natural, including the herbal tea she 's sipping. She uses cloth bags for purchases. Their German shepherd, Makana, eats natural dog food. Their bath towels, bed sheets, and bathrobes are made from organic cotton. She points out pieces of secondhand furniture--a small table, decorative tubs made of recycled tires. <p> They use natural cleansers--such as baking soda and vinegar-- non-toxic shampoo and soap, and energy-efficient light bulbs. Behind the garage are two compost bins for tea bags, banana peels, and the like. Around front are curbside recycling bins they regularly fill up. <p> Her " green " list could go on, but the picture is clear. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discovery Networks, columnist, and new book author embodies the essence of what it means to live naturally, in tune with nature and the environment. <p> Her life is focused on spreading the " green living " gospel, ingrained in her as a child, to help other people make simple life changes she hopes will contribute to a sea change in their own health and the well-being of the environment. <p> " My mission is not to become some massive superstar and to have this whole empire built around me, " she said. " My mission is being on the ground and helping people find ways to live more naturally, so they can have healthier bodies, healthier children, and healthier homes. It 's so immensely important. " <p> Yet what we all need to do, she says, is n't remarkably new. And it does n't have to be all that hard. <p> " We 're not inventing a new way of doing things. We 're really going back to the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's why sometimes I call it simple living. <p> " We did n't used to spray our crops with so many chemicals ; we did n't used to abuse our resources the way we do now ; we did n't used to view everything as being so disposable as it is now, " says Snow. <p> Her first book, Sara Snow 's Fresh Living : The Essential Room-by-Room Guide to a Greener, Healthier Family and Home, comes out in March. Snow wants people to know that green living does n't have to be all or nothing. That 's a mistake a lot of people make, she says. They can take small steps, get comfortable with them, and move on to others. Living greener can be as simple as starting to cook at home more often, rather than going out so much, because you 'll likely eat healthier, she says, also adding to remember how your grandmother or mother made dishes, the food they cooked. Do some of those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own. Also, be intentional about not overbuying in general. Buying secondhand goods also helps cut down on needless waste, Snow says. <p> To make the biggest impact, Snow advises taking steps in three areas : eating less processed food and more organic food ; cutting back on your home energy usage ; and improving your transportation methods so you 're using less energy. <p> Organic products are still between 10 percent and 20 percent more expensive than nonorganic food, although in-season, local organic produce may not be any more expensive. If you ca n't afford to buy all organic, Snow suggests at least buying organic milk( easy to find) and buying meat that 's hormone- and antibiotic-free. <p> Another important step is buying organic versions of the fruits and vegetables on the so-called " dirty dozen " list created by the Environmental Working Group, which studied the level of pesticide residue on edible parts of produce. Buying organic apples, strawberries, green peppers, lettuce, and other produce on the list has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps like turning oft lights when not in use, only running the dishwasher when it 's full, conserving water, and, of course, switching to energy-efficient bulbs can add up over time. <p> If you ca n't buy a hybrid car, Snow suggests making whatever vehicle you drive as energy-efficient as possible with steps such as changing the air filter and inflating tires. She wants people to consider public transportation when available, carpooling, and alternate means. <p> Snow has a plethora of other ideas to live greener, from buying natural cosmetics and green beauty products to creating your own all-purpose cleaner, with equal parts white distilled vinegar and water, and your own furniture polish with two parts olive oil to one part lemon juice. <p> Easier said than done? <p> Sure, living a greener lifestyle takes extra thought, perhaps more time, and sometimes more money, Snow says. But she believes the rewards are worth it. Hopefully, the pay off will be spending less time at the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy your day. <p> For those who say the expense is a barrier to buying healthier and organic foods, she argues that perhaps consumers could forego other nonessential items, such as a fourth TV or new cell phone. <p> Awareness of the green movement--from the benefits of organic food and hybrid cars to the problem of global warming--has grown significantly in the post five years and is now widespread. <p> Today, many people recycle, buy organic foods, and are taking those first steps, Snow believes. <p> " The reality is that many people have the awareness, but they 're stalled at the starting blocks, " she says. " They want to do something, but they feel like it 's going to be overwhelming. " <p> Snow developed her green living roots naturally. Her father, Tim Redmond, was a pioneer in the natural foods movement and cofounded major organic firms, including Eden Foods. And, her grandparents were organic gardeners. <p> Snow grew up in a " family community " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Michigan, with her mother, father, and her grandparents. There, Snow and her older brother, Nate, composted garbage, helped harvest food from two massive family gardens and hung their clothes by the wood stove( no furnace, just solar panels) to warm up on chilly mornings. <p> Even though her life was quite different from her public school classmates ', she never felt deprived, nor did she envy the more typical foods they ate while she drank soy milk and munched on carob bars. Her parents taught her food can be used as medicine to make your body well, or it can do some serious harm. <p> " We felt like we were really a part of something big. At least there was a purpose behind it all, and my dad was helping to save the world through food, " recalls Snow, chuckling fondly. <p> The knowledge she gained while growing up shaped her career. Snow is a graduate of Butler University in Indianapolis in telecommunications and theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's SportsCentury series and then as a morning news reporter/ anchor for the Indianapolis Fox affiliate. <p> But the lifestyle did n't suit her, so after seven years she left to blend her life 's work with her life 's passion--green living. <p> In 2005 and 2007, Snow created and hosted two eco-lifestyle series, now shown in reruns on Discovery Health and FitTV. They 're called Living Fresh and Get Fresh With Sara Snow. Segments profile how companies and real people are living greener lifestyles. She also has regular segments on CNN.com LIVE ; has her own Web site, sarasnow.com ; is developing another TV series ; and hopes to write another book. <p> With all the attention on green living in the country, what 's holding people back? <p> " Sometimes I think the hardest thing is just the first change, breaking the mold and changing your habits, " says Snow, an advisory board member for Discovery 's Planet Green, the first-ever, 24-hour green television network. " Once you 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Snow is optimistic about the future of the green movement 10 or more years down the road. " At the very least, we will have slowed the rate at which we are destroying this very fragile planet. " Snow is impressed by the environmental awareness of college-age Americans and even more by younger children. She believes that by the time they are running companies and households, if we are n't already seeing serious changes, we will by then. <p> " My hope beyond that is we will start to live less as little selfish individuals in our own little bubbles, " she says. " We do n't interact with our neighbors ; we do n't spend time outside interacting with the natural world. " <p> As for herself, Snow would like to recreate that idyllic time when her family members relied on each other, supported each other, and lived close together. <p> " My personal hope is that I 'll be back on a little family community, and all of my family will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such a perfect way to live. " <p> Snow 's new book outlines a room-by-room guide to a more environmentally friendly home. <p> The natural living advocate advises shopping at local farmers ' markets for fresh produce or joining a community supported agriculture( CSA) group for a regular share of local, healthy crops. <p> Snow empowers people to embrace healthier choices, using practical examples to reveal just how easy, healthy, and rewarding a more natural lifestyle is. <p> While hosting the series Get Fresh with Sara Snow, Snow interviewed her dad, Tim Redmond--a pioneer in the natural foods industry--who introduced his daughter to healthy living. <p> A true " greenie, " Snow even feeds her German shepherd, Makana, natural dog food. <p> By Barb Berggoetz <p> <p> SARA SNOW 'S GREEN LIVING TIPS FOR THE HOME **21;11289;P IN THE KITCHEN <p> * Shop often to avoid overbuying of processed foods and to keep a steady amount of fresh foods on hand. <p> * Buy organic to avoid pesticide exposure and increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Buy recycled-content paper products like tissues and toilet paper. <p> * Take shorter showers and save up to five gallons of water per minute. <p> L : IN THE BEDROOM * Try organic cotton sheets for a comfy and healthy, natural bed. <p> * Look for eco-friendly materials like organic wool and sustainable bamboo. <p> L : IN THE NURSERY * Simplify and avoid overbuying for a clutter-free and environmentally sound nursery. <p> * Seek out natural body products for your baby 's sensitive skin. <p> L : IN THE LIVING ROOM * Place energy-efficient CFLs( compact fluorescent light bulbs) in your most commonly used fixtures. <p> * Make use of secondhand furniture for a more eco-friendly choice. <p> L : IN THE LAUNDRY * Avoid cleaning products with synthetic fragrances. <p> * Line dry your clothes, either inside or outside, for on energy-efficient laundry room. <p> L : IN THE OFFICE * Avoid getting excess mail by asking catalog companies to lake you off their lists. <p> * Unplug electronics like computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't waste power. <p> L : THROUGHOUT THE HOME * Use common plants to clear the indoor air, which is often more polluted than the air outside.
