4107141 Melissa McCarthy, interviewed by her daughter, Viv, 3 <p> The Mike &; Molly star takes a walk down the aisle in this month 's comedy Bridesmaids. But first, she needs to play a little princess. <p> Viv : Cinderella is my favorite princess. Who 's yours, Mommy? <p> Melissa : I think she 's mine too, because we spend so much time dressing up as Cinderella, watching Cinderella, and even going so far as to guess who she 's going to marry. <p> Viv : I think she 's going to marry Brendan. He has short hair and looks like a chicken. <p> Melissa : Brendan is your friend at school! You just have a big crush on him. <p> Viv : Can we play the two princesses? <p> Melissa : We like to make up wild and long stories about Belle, Snow White, and Cinderella, do n't we? <p> Viv : I 'm going to get them. She 's gone and then back with her Disney dolls. Do me and Cinderella have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes. <p> Viv : How about me and Snow White? <p> Melissa : I think her eyes are brown. <p> Viv : I think Cinderella is more beautiful. I have a blue dress just like hers. Mostly I only wear it at the house. <p> Melissa : And to the grocery store, on walks, doing errands.... <p> Viv : What food do I love, Mommy? <p> Melissa : Vivi, you are 24/7 macaroni and cheese. You 're the most dedicated macaroni-and-cheese person I have ever met. <p> Viv : You 're a bridesmaid because you were already a bride, right? <p> Melissa : In the movie I play Megan, the groom 's sister, the girl they had to put in the wedding party. It 's weird how wedding planners these days think everyone wants to be a princess. <p> Viv : I want to be a princess! <p> Melissa : You are a princess! <p> -- ADAPTED BY LORI BERGER <p> Photograph : Melissa stars with Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> ANDREW SOUTHAM/ICON INTERNATIONAL.
