2022441 GOING PLACES Headnote Visits to Sesame Place, Busch Gardens, Water Country USA, and Kings Dominion, sandwiched around a side trip to the Baltimore Zoo and National Aquarium, proved to be fantastic family fare. // DURING THE TIME we dated and through the early years of our marriage, my wife had a hard-and-fast rule when it came to vacations : It 's always better to end a trip a day too early than a day too late. On our various getaways to Hawaii, Aruba, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, and Florida, her advice proved wise indeed. So it was with a little bit of shock that I heard about our latest planned adventure. We were to hit the road for nine straight days -- the first and last being for travel exclusively -- working our way from New York to Pennsylvania to Maryland to, finally, Virginia, while visiting Sesame Place, the Baltimore Zoo, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Busch Gardens, Water Country USA, and Kings Dominion. I certainly was up for such a trip, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extent. After all, our oldest, Julie, was just four, and her younger brothers, Alex and Trevor, were three and one, respectively. Apparently, though, Margaret had done some strategic politicking with our offspring while I was at the office. They not only were all pumped up to go, daily counting down the days until our departure, but each night at the dinner table-without fail-in the weeks leading up to our vacation, the two oldest would recite our entire itinerary : listing all the places we were to go to, as well as the names of the hotels we were to stay at and the type of accommodations we were to enjoy at each, like whether it had an indoor or outdoor swimming pool, if the pools were heated, which places were suites, what nights they would be sleeping on a pull-out couch, etc. One of the concessions I had to make once we had children was that my days of going places in the off-season were over. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth if made to stand in long lines-I 'll never understand the lure of Walt Disney World-I was resigned to my fate of exclusively summer vacations. However, since our oldest was only in prekindergarten, a late-spring vacation could still be a reality, at least for this year. The trouble is, with three water parks on the docket, we were gambling with the weather. Before June, it 's common to run into not only rainy days, but cool ones.( Personally, I love the cold and the rain more than anything except a raging blizzard, but nowadays, the kids must come first.) Yet, early and mid May produced neardrought conditions in the Northeast for the first time in memory. Not only did n't a drop of rain fall, but there was n't a cloud sighting for weeks. We left early Saturday afternoon under blue skies-that was to change drastically in less than 24 hours-for Langhorne, Pa., home of Sesame Place, the idea being to arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, then get a good night 's sleep so we 'd be fresh, alert, and on time to the park Sunday morning. It went like clockwork. The drive turned out to be a breeze. Despite their tender years, our kids are excellent long-distance riders-no whining about the drive being too long ; no grousing about each other talking or singing or playing too loudly ; and, most gratifying to their parents, no asking constantly, " Are we there yet? " Moreover, we brought along the perfect insurance policy -- Video-in-a-Bag-so our trio of young travelers could watch their favorite tapes anytime they wanted. We left Julie in charge of the inventory, although it was usually Trevor, the most aggressive of our threesome, who was making the selections. I stayed in the mini-van with the kids while Margaret went to check in. It was a bit of a long wait as there were three wedding parties( and guests) coming and going at the time of our arrival. The sight of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what was going on. I explained that the women were on their way to a wedding, which led to a fascinating discussion in which I learned that my daughter was going to get married and be a mommy someday, but not before first being a " lady doctor " or " owning her own haircutting store. " When I asked why she could n't be a mother and a doctor or beautician, she was quite emphatic : " I do n't want to do both at the same time! Being a mommy comes after I 'm done with the other things. "( She 's since altered her career plans, and now wants to be a swimming instructor.) Photograph The Land of the Dragons play area at Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, Va., was such a big hit, it necessitated a second-day visit. Photograph The Land of the Dragons play area at Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, Va., was such a big hit, it necessitated a second-day visit. // After check-in, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great in restaurants, Trevor can be a terror. Not on this night, though. Dinner was devoured without incident, so quickly in fact that there was still time to go in the heated outdoor pool back at the hotel. Considering what awaited our three waterbugs the following day, this proved to be a good call. We were up early the next morning so we 'd have time to eat breakfast, check out, and get over to Sesame Place before the park opened. We got a rude greeting upon walking to the car. It was cloudy. It was cold. It was windy. Uh-oh, Mom and Dad cringed. Undeterred by the conditions, Julie said, " That 's okay ; me, Alley, and Trevvy can wear our spring jackets that Mommy packed And so they did. Ah, the resilience of youth. The day at Sesame started indoors with a newly added feature, " Elmo 's World Live! " Based on the popular segment from TV 's " Sesame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Noodle explore the concept of dance. Before the show, the ushers asked for volunteers to sit up front to join Elmo on stage. While Julie is hardly shy, she 's not usually the volunteering type. Nevertheless, she was quite certain that she wanted to dance with Elmo, and dance she did, displaying not a lick of inhibition. We 've been to Sesame Place before, enough times to know that even minus the pools and water rides, there is still plenty to do. Topping the list on this day was Grover 's Vapor Trail, the 14-acre park 's lone roller coaster. Because Sesame Place is designed for young children, it did n't even have a roller coaster until a few years ago. Vapor Trail thankfully is n't one of those new-fangled thrill rides that will shave years off your life while defying the laws of physics. It has enough dips and turns to get the kids screaming, but with delight, not out of fear. Since the chilly weather held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trail over and over again without having to wait on line. This was especially satisfying for Alex, who all day long kept calling it the " sideways roller coaster. " During past trips, he had been forced to watch his sister have all the fun while he could only stand on the sidelines. There was the requisite walk over to Sesame Neighborhood, a full-size, outdoor re-creation of the classic " Sesame Street " television set, where impromptu photo sessions with kids and their favorite characters take place. Youngsters have to run, jump, and play, too, and that 's where Sesame really comes through. There are a number of non -- water park areas where kids can climb( on Cookie Mountain, a vinyl cone that participants slide down once they reach the top), bounce( on Ernie 's Bed, a huge, springy air mattress that 's perfect for jumping and leaping), and enjoy an assortment of slides, mazes, tunnels, ropes, sand toys, and oversized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each visit is to climb the dozens of steps to the top( or face) of the Big Bird statue, where they yell down for us to take their picture while they proudly stand as if they 've conquered Mt. Everest. Live shows are a key part of the Sesame Place experience. We especially enjoyed David Jack 's Jungle Adventure. His CD has been a hit at our house the last few years, so seeing him live was a treat. The show is innovative and entertaining, and it 's especially cute when he hands the microphone to small children who bravely sing the lyrics to his well-known songs. Hardy campers that they are, Julie and Alex insisted on trying the water rides despite the uninviting temperatures. Dad reluctantly volunteered to brave the chilly waters with them. That experiment did n't last long. For openers, Julie 's favorite ride, Little Bird 's Rapids, was closed because of chipping paint, so we opted for Sesame Streak, a somewhat scary descent on a two-person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splash pool. Alex went first, and it was to be his only attempt of the day. The water had him shivering while the speed and blind curves had him shaking. Julie, though, liked the thrill of the quick turns. After Sesame Streak, she opted for Slippery Slope, a 75-foot slide into a splash pool. This was a mistake. I went first, so I could wait and catch her when it was her turn. I could see the fear in her eyes as she shot down the slide ; then I compounded the situation by letting her slip through my arms, and under she went. Margaret quickly soothed all the frayed nerves with plenty of hugs and kisses, dried everyone off, and announced that it was time to watch the Rock Around the Block Parade in which Sesame characters such as Big Bird, Elmo, Zoe, The Count, Bert &; Ernie, Cookie Monster, Rosita, Prairie Dawn, and Telly Monster ride on floats and dance into the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes. This was a big hit, with our three yelling and pointing every time a favorite character passed by. So Dad 's water follies were quickly forgotten, and the day ended on a happy note. When planning this family getaway, Margaret was faced with a problem : Water Country USA and Kings Dominion were n't open until Friday and Saturday, respectively. What to do to fill in the Monday-Tuesday gap between Sesame and our Wednesday-Thursday visit to Busch Gardens? She reasoned that, if we were going to drive all the way down to Virginia, why not find something to do along the way. A look at the atlas indicated that Baltimore would be a perfect stopover venue. With the Baltimore Zoo celebrating its 125th anniversary( it is America 's third-oldest zoo), the National Aquarium located in the beautifully renovated seaport area of the city, and our kids totally fascinated by creatures on land and sea, we had the perfect transition from theme park to natural wonders and then back to theme parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quickly suggested that we flip-flop our plans, and visit the indoor aquarium today and save the zoo for tomorrow. Margaret promptly nixed the idea, pointing out that the aquarium was a half-day event and we had a five-hour drive to Williamsburg to consider. Besides, she glumly explained, the weather forecasts were for rain up and down the East Coast for the rest of the week. We did n't say it out loud, but the silent looks we exchanged said it all : Our vacation was in danger of being a washout. The kids, though, buoyed our spirits. The rain meant nothing to them-after all, they had their jackets and umbrellas-so let 's go. We had opted out of a summer vacation to avoid crowds, but when you visit a zoo, aquarium, or the like during a weekday when school is in session, there 's always the danger of field trips. Despite the inclement weather, the zoo was overrun with seemingly thousands of kids. Compounding the problem was they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Zoo. Crowds of youngsters did n't deter our brood, however. They loved jumping on the oversized lily pads, climbing in and out of the spinning turtle shells, whizzing down the giant( real) tree slide, and riding the carousel. In the Farmyard, there was the usual assortment of horses, cows, pigs, sheep, and goats. Moreover, we were treated to the sight of a hatching egg, as a tiny chick slowly pecked his way out of his shell. It was like watching one of those nature programs on TV, only now it was live. Still, I sensed our crew was anticipating Photograph In Sesame Place 's Rock Around the Block parade, Elmo, Big Bird, Bert &; Ernie, and many other Sesame Street " characters ride on floats and dance with the crowd to 1950s rock " n ' roll music. // bigger game, and they 'd certainly get that in the coming afternoon. After lunch, the rain slowed to a drizzle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we explored the rest of this beautifully landscaped enclave for wildlife. The Baltimore Zoo, featuring more than 2,000 animals, takes an active role in the preservation of some of the world 's most endangered creatures through several Species Survival Plan initiatives. It recently has undertaken a redevelopment program, tackling the replacement of an aging infrastructure as well as the improvement of facilities and exhibits. Currently, 80 of its 161 acres are developed. While the ambitious plans include taking various species out of cages and putting them in open areas so they have more room to roam, it still is fascinating to walk along the zoo 's Main Valley, where the enclosures date from the 1800s. The polar bear, arctic foxes, snow leopards, red panda, prairie dogs, and tigers were a big hit with the kids. Although it started coming down in buckets again, the animals were blithely unaffected as they prowled their cages, eye-balling our family( their only visitors at this point) as we peered at them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone through the Africa section. Since it was only drizzling at this point, we could linger while observing the cheetah, elephants, lions, warthogs, and rhinos. Two indoor exhibits were a delight as well. The Giraffe House, a unique structure, at least in our limited experience, is a circular building, where visitors walk into the center while the animals are in wooden pens that line the perimeter. Oversized picture windows allow you to see each animal 's legs and body, but its upper half is n't discernible, at least until you look up and see a giraffe head sticking out into " public " space. Their bins of hay were on our side of the wall, ensuring that the hosts would come " out " to visit. The Chimpanzee Forest provided some unexpected interactive play as one of the chimps took his stick and playfully began poking it at Alex, who, if it were possible, would have gladly obliged and grabbed his end of the small wooden pole. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, putting on quite a show of jumping, climbing, playing, and screeching. In contrast, the crocodiles, located a few doors down, lay quiet as death, only their eyes and snouts breaking the surface of the water. Nature continued its contrary games with the weather the next day. Despite dire promises of an all-out drenching, the storms held back as a warm, muggy front moved in. Truth be told, I 'd rather have been at the zoo in the rain than in the heat and humidity. At least the Aquarium was air-conditioned. Like the Baltimore Zoo, weekday mornings at the National Aquarium are madness because of local school field trips. This has been even more evident since everyone is flocking to see the spectacular exhibit, " Seahorses : Beyond Imagination. " All the jostling for position was worth it, though. This astounding 2,000-square-foot display presents 10 of the world 's 35 identified species of seahorses, along with weedy and leafy seadragons and several species of pipefish. Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elaborate sound system provide visitors with one of the most diverse presentations of seahorses ever created on the East Coast. There are tiger tail seahorses from the Philippines, potbelly ones from Southeast Australia, blue stripe pipefish from East Africa, dragonface pipefish from Indonesia, and giant Pacific seahorses from Mexico. These creatures range from less than half an inch in length to more than 12 inches tall. All you women out there should be heartened to hear that it is the male that becomes pregnant during courtship. The female deposits eggs into his brood pouch, where he fertilizes them. The young develop in the pouch. Gestation periods range from 10 to 30 days, depending on the species.( Who says men ca n't pull their weight?) While " Seahorses : Beyond Imagination " is only a temporary exhibit, wrapping up its two-year run in Baltimore in the spring of 2003, one of the aquarium 's more permanent features is the live bottlenose dolphin show. Personally, I thought there could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing by the dolphins and a little less ecological talk by the narrator. Still, it was informative and the kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Photograph The inhabitants of the Chimpanzee Forest in the Baltimore Zoo put on quite a show-jumping, climbing, playing, screeching( and sometimes lounging) r-much to the delight of onlookers. Photograph The Children 's Zoo, part of the Baltimore Zoo, has a number of interactive features, including shells in which kids can see what it feels like to be a turtle. // We eventually made our way to the Tropical Rain Forest, which showcased the diversity of animals and fauna found in the deepest, darkest jungles on Earth. Trouble was, after a chilly day at Sesame Place and a cool, wet visit to the zoo, Mom instinctively had the kids in long sleeves. This was fine for the mostly air-conditioned facility, but not so for a rain forest environment. We were so hot and anxious to cool down that we raced right by the tank of piranha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed it down to me-I harbor an extreme fascination for three particular predator fish : the piranha, barracuda, and shark. In true family tradition, I had my kids all excited about seeing this trio of aquatic killers. But this aquarium has no barracuda( yes, I called to lodge my complaint), and I missed the piranha because of heat exhaustion. The aquarium has five levels. On level one, dozens of stingrays( another favorite of mine and my kids) and many small sharks can be seen from the surface or through the underwater viewing windows of the 260,000-gallon pool. The ray collection is the largest in the country. On level two, the Open Ocean, large sharks and small-toothed sawfish slowly encircle visitors inside a 225,000-gallon ringshaped tank. This was what I really had come for, as well as to see the kids ' reaction to the hammerhead, the way Alex gasped at the size of their teeth, and how Julie was amazed that a fish could actually be bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seahorses, my daughter proclaimed at the end of the day that her favorite residents at the aquarium were the harbor and gray seals located in a 70,000-gallon outdoor rock pool outside the main building. For Alex, it was a tie between the giant Pacific octopus and the electric eel.( Trevor did n't make a selection ; he 'd slept in a carrier on my back most of the day.) There are more than 14,000 fish and mammals representing nearly 600 species at the aquarium. Of course, the true test of diversity and interest always lies with the kids, and throughout the morning and into the early afternoon, all we heard was " Dad, quick, come look at this " ; " Mommy, over here, you have to see this fish " ; " Alley, hurry, see what 's in this tank " ; " Ju-Ju, wow, do you see that? " It became a mad scramble. They were fascinated by the creatures in each exhibit, yet could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one. The five-hour drive down to Williamsburg was uneventful-until we were almost there. Then, the skies opened up on the Interstate like I 've rarely seen. I consider myself an excellent driver and feel confident maneuvering our vehicle through practically all conditions, but for one of the few times in my life, I was tempted to pull over and wait it out. However, visibility was so bad that I decided it would be more dangerous to be stopped on the side of the road than to inch along the highway and hope for the best. The deluge lasted only about 15 minutes, but it seemed like hours. When it suddenly stopped, we breathed a sigh of relief, but then it started again. This time, though, it did n't last as long. Still, it was a relief when we finally pulled into our hotel in what was now bright sunshine. My wife, as usual, had planned our accommodations perfectly. We were to spend eight nights away. Williamsburg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a spacious hotel suite with two king-sized beds, a large living room, and a full kitchen. We had n't planned to cook, but it sure was convenient to have a fridge, microwave, and dinette table, since, by this point in the trip, take-out dinners were our main evening fare. We took advantage of the laundry room across from the elevator because, even though we were on vacation, it was either do laundry or rent a trailer and fill it with kids ' clothes. Moreover, a full breakfast buffet was included, which saved us plenty of time and money.( As my father-in-law used to say : " I 'd rather clothe them than feed them. ") Upon picking up our passes to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA the next morning, we were informed that the past four days had been a nightmare weather-wise. For the next 72 hours, at least, things would be picture-perfect with temperatures in the mid 80s, low humidity, and bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neverending list of chores : applying sunblock to the kids. Busch Gardens, with its beautifully landscaped grounds, features 17th-century European-themed sections( representing six different countries) and four wild, scary roller coasters : Apollo 's Chariot, 70 mph, 210-foot drop ; Alpengeist, 67 mph, 195-foot drop ; Loch Ness Monster, 60 mph, the world 's first interlocking, double-looping steel coaster ; and The Big Bad Wolf, 48 mph, among the world 's first suspended models. To thrill-seekers, I say, go forth and enjoy, as I did when I was younger and more foolish.( In 1993, I went on the Loch Ness Monster and The Big Bad Wolf. I also believe that was the year my first gray hair appeared.) On this visit, I turned pale on the Wilde Maus, a single-car roller coaster designed for kids that simulates the motion of a mouse going through a maze. To me, it simulated a car going off a sharp curve on a mountain road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more. " Again, Daddy! Can we go on it again?! " I staggered to a shady bench, took a few gulps from my water bottle, and gasped, " Only if Mommy will take you. " After Margaret and Julie took their turn, my wife 's bemused smile said it all, " You 're a big, fat chicken and a scaredy-cat. " The next day, I sought to redeem myself by agreeing to another spin. As we waited on line, Julie was assuring me that it was okay to be frightened. The pair on line in front of us-a man whose girth indicated he was about the same 235 pounds I was and his young daughter-overheard Julie 's pep talk. He sympathetically reported that he, too, had a few palpitations when he 'd ridden it earlier. What was funny-or sensible, depending on your point of view-is, as we were about to board the four-seat car with him and his daughter, he suggested that I take the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right spot. " No sense us both sitting on the same side and tipping around one of those curves, " he said, only half-kidding. Photograph Among the fascinating creatures on display at the National Aquarium in Baltimore are the bizarre leafy seadragon( left) and the aptly named longsnout seahorse. // It was Julie 's turn to be shaken up on " Escape from Pompeii. " She 's fearless when it comes to log flumes, raft rides, and the like. In fact, the ominous-looking drop to end the ride is what appealed to her as we walked by. However, we did n't anticipate such an authentic re-creation of a volcanic eruption that preceded the finale. Even I was taken aback as stone pillars and statues crashed all around the raft and real flames shot up close enough to heat your cheeks. She was clinging to me tightly, tears welling in her big green eyes, before it was finally over. Still, she recovered quickly, and for the next couple of days, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to chide her, " So, Jules, you think we should try this one again? " She 'd always return a good-sport smile before Mommy would put me in my place. " Julie will go on Pompeii again if you 'll go on Wilde Maus. " End of ribbing. The shops in each of the six countries -- Ireland, Germany, Italy, Scotland, England, and France-are bursting with a wonderful assortment of gifts, souvenirs, and crafted items endemic to that particular nation. When Margaret and I visited Busch Gardens eight years earlier, we 'd done a lot of browsing and buying, which is really saying something because my wife is not a shopper. This time, though, we could only look longingly at the storefront displays, as having three children under five makes it nearly impossible to enter such establishments. Likewise, the ethnic food available is mouth-watering. While many parks only offer hot dogs, french fries, and maybe fried chicken, our kids were happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy. Our offspring also have an appreciation of flowers and vegetation. Each has a designated garden at home( although Dad does all the upkeep, of course), and they enjoyed seeing the vast array of colorful blooms that are everywhere. The park 's landscape features more than 150,000 annuals, 80,000 tulips, 6,000 chrysanthemums, and 700 container gardens, as well as thousands of trees and shrubs. Two-dozen landscape artists spend nearly six hours a day pruning, planting, and weeding. A great way to appreciate the flowers and layout of the park is on the skyride, which traverses the park from the air. Too bad it was under repair. Instead, we had to settle for the train. The ride is not only scenic, but convenient, as at the end of each car there 's a spot for strollers, and they do n't even have to be emptied and folded. Shunning most of the adult rides in favor of things they could negotiate, our youngsters enjoyed a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and hang glider and balloon rides. Still, they were willing to tackle some adult enterprises, including a log flume and white-water raft ride( Julie), teacup ride( Julie and Alex), and Le Mans Raceway( Julie, Alex, and Trevor). All three also ventured into the 4-D show, " Pirates, " and all but Trevor left in tears. Too bad, because Mom and I thought the short film, about a hapless pirate crew and its wacky captain( starting Leslie Nielsen and Eric Idle), was really cool. The 3-D glasses actually worked-too well, it turned out, as the ultrarealistic scenes had the kids burying their heads in our chests. Making matters worse( or better, according to Mom and Dad), was the buzzing in our ears( from bees), the disquieting breeze in our hair( from bats), and the perceived droplets on our heads( from birds), which accounted for the 4-D appellation. Busch Gardens has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevor to sit still for too long. We did take in " A Dragon 's Tale. " I suspect the kids thought it had to do with " Dragon Tales, " a favorite PBS show of theirs. Nevertheless, they seemed to enjoy it, and all remained calm since Trevor was napping in the stroller. A favorite spot both days was Land of the Dragons, a play area with rope-climbing, slides, sprinklers and chutes. On our second visit, I managed to lose Alex when Margaret left for just a few minutes to go change Trevor 's diaper. She returned to find me mildly panic-stricken.( The topography was such that he could n't have left the area without passing by me, yet I still could n't find him.) Margaret told me to calm down and take Trevor. A couple of minutes later, she returned with Alex. Even without being there, she knew exactly where he was based on his exploits the day before. You got ta love a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wilde Maus roller coaster at Busch Gardens is capable of creating plenty of palpitations for adult riders as well, especially when it hits those hairpin curves, much like a car negotiating a mountain road. Photograph Escape from Pompeii at Busch Gardens is designed to terrorize viewers with a surprisingly realistic re-creation of a volcanic eruption, including shooting flames and crashing pillars. // The two days at Busch seemed to disappear before we knew it. Although the time flew by, these were long days that entailed a lot of walking. So after dinner and a dip in the hotel pool, we were all ready for an early bedtime. Friday turned out to be the pinnacle of the week as the kids finally had their day in the sun at a water park. We had bookended the trip with venues( Sesame Place and Kings Dominion, respectively) that had water rides contained within the larger theme park. You already know what happened at Sesame, and we 'll get to the Kings Dominion story later on. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is where we spent 99.9% of our time. We set up morning shop at Cow-A -- Bunga, a 4,500-square-foot pool replete with water slides and falls, gushing fountains, water cannons, and an assortment of interactive activities. It was heaven on Earth for the kids. Since there was 100% visibility from poolside, all we had to do was pull up a lounge chair and watch. Trevor, 20 months old at the time, was going through a stage where only Daddy would do. He refused to stay in the stroller, instead demanding that his father lug him around everywhere. It actually was quite funny because, unlike his older siblings, when Trevor first came home from the hospital after his birth, he 'd have nothing to do with me. In fact, he was sure to cry-quite vociferously -- if I held him. Neighbors, friends, family, even strangers would get nuzzled, and Dad would get an earful of screaming. Anyway, my youngest 's new attitude finally worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trev is about 11 a.m. He 'd been shortchanged all week trying to nap in a stroller in which he could n't stretch out fully, but situated in an oversized reclining lounge in the shade, he slipped into a restful, deep sleep. Since I 'd carried him around endlessly all week, Margaret left me to loll in the chair next to him, and for two and a half hours, neither of us moved. It was quite pleasant. When he finally rose, we were overdue for a late lunch, so we hustled over to the picnic tables alongside another children 's area, Kid 's Kingdom. After devouring their meal, the kids were ready to return to their aquatic activities. Kid 's Kingdom proved a ball, thanks to the scaled-down water slides, play equipment, and fountains. While Trevor and I returned to Cow-A -- Bunga, Julie and Alex decided to brave the wave pool with Mom. Not surprisingly, Alex was escorted back to us in tears. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to return to the Surfer 's Bay Wave Pool, while Alex and Trevor had a blast on the water slides directly in front of my lounging area. When the family reunited, we decided to try the lazy river. The tubes were big enough for Julie to ride with Mom, while Trevor and Alex got a kick out of perching on Dad 's big belly during a meandering float around the area. Still ahead, though, was H20 UFO, Water Country 's largest interactive play area. An array of slides, spray jets, and waterfalls had Julie and Alex squealing with delight. As usual, I was on the sidelines with Trevor while Mom joined her two oldest in the water. Once again, we were going to close the park, thus living up to our motto : Come early, stay late. Then, as a portent of what awaited us tomorrow, the skies suddenly darkened and a rumbling sound filled the air. Even after hard drops began, the kids insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderland to end. Finally, we were able to persuade all three-Trevor was in up to his waist by this time-that it indeed was time to go. No sooner did we get them out of the water when the downpour began in earnest-not that it mattered, since we were all in bathing suits. Although we hardly needed confirmation, we knew the day was a smashing success when Julie announced that we could skip the hotel pool tonight, not due to the rain( it had stopped by then), but because they 'd spent enough time in the water already. Photograph At Water Country USA, youngsters can enjoy an assortment of fun-filled pool activities, including tube chutes in which an adult is not needed. // About 50 miles from Williamsburg is Doswell, Va., home to Kings Dominion, the 400-acre Paramount theme and water park and our final stop before heading home to New York. We had hoped to end the vacation on a high note, and we did, but only because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured, poured, poured -- and then poured some more. All day. All the time. No letup. No exaggeration. The kids? They could n't have cared less. True, they 'd have liked to have splashed around WaterWorks, the 19-acre water park that 's part of the Kings Dominion lot, but with the previous day still fresh in their minds, no water park turned out to be no sweat. Still, Margaret and I could n't help but be impressed with their attitude. Not a single complaint( I swear) about the rain-and it was a cold rain, too. We kept them covered with umbrellas and the stroller hood as best we could ; toweled off their sopping seats on each of the rides ; and bought them ponchos to go over their coats and hats. After a while, though, it became pointless because there simply was no letup. With all three drenched from head to toe, we held a quick family meeting. Mom and I offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our new hotel or start home for New York. Julie and Alex would n't hear of it. They pleaded for more rides. Trevor, who was n't speaking in sentences at the time, agreed with his brother and sister, chiming in, " Stay! Stay! " Okay, then. It was back to the Kidzville section, where all 14 rides saw double or triple duty. The Taxi Jam Coaster held Alex 's attention all day. He 'd ride it a couple of times ; try something else ; then come back for another spin or two. And so it went. The popular ride for Julie was the Scooby-Doo Ghoster Coaster, one of those old-time wood coasters. She always chose the front or last car for optimum thrills. Scooby-Doo is the tamest of Kings Dominion 's 11 world-class roller coasters. The newest, which opened this year, is the most incredible, unbelievable amusement park attraction I 've ever seen. The HyperSonic XLC is the world 's first air -- launched roller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mph in 1.8 seconds) of any ride in the world. Its angle of descent( 180) is also unmatched. Riders ascend a 165-foot-tall vertical tower at a 180 angle. Then it 's over the top( no pun intended) as the coaster descends straight down! Julie, Alex, and I watched all this from the top of the Eiffel Tower, a 332-foot replica of the Parisian monument. The entire park is visible from there and, kids being kids, they got as much a kick out of spotting our car in the parking lot as they did spying all 11 roller coasters and the rides they 'd just enjoyed in Kidzville. A present we gave Julie for her fourth birthday proved valuable when we descended the tower and made our way to Nickelodeon Central and the Rugrats Toonpike. There, kids drive an electric automobile( that 's not on any sort of a track) while cruising through the Rugrats neighborhood. The streets are replete with stoplights, a gas station, and traffic signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric car back home, our daughter was easily the best driver each of the four times she climbed behind the wheel. This skill also served her( and Alex) well later that evening. After Alex and Trevor went through Meet Blue a couple of times-an interactive adventure in which you follow several clues to solve the day 's puzzle before going into Steve 's house, where Nickelodeon TV icon Blue awaits-it was almost dinnertime, and lo and behold a miracle-the rain stopped. Since the park stayed open late, we did n't have to get up early the next morning, it was the last day of vacation, and the kids were all for it, we decided to eat dinner there, take everyone out to the car for a set of dry clothes, and return to enjoy a few more rides. So back we went to explore some unchartered territory in the park, only this time under clear, cool skies. After trying the Carousel, Log Flume( twice), Antique Cars, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick one more ride apiece. Alex chose the Top Cat Taxi, while Julie selected the kiddie bumper cars. At Busch Gardens, our oldest showed both poise and ruthlessness in( successfully) going after other cars.( I taught her well.) Alex, however, could n't get the hang of it, and inevitably got stuck in some corner. " I just ca n't do it, Dad!, " he cried, tears of frustration rolling down his cheeks. Nevertheless, I convinced him to take another shot that night at Kings Dominion. Same teary results. That 's when commonsense Mom stepped in, suggesting that, instead of putting them in separate cars, they should go together, with Alex riding shotgun. " Now we 'll do some real bumping, right Alley?, " said Julie, repeating my oft-spoken phrase from whenever I took her on the adult bumper cars. Our dynamic duo proved a formidable team. With Alex now relieved of the pressure of working the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister toward a succession of automotive victims. He pointed with obvious relish at one car after another, and his heavy-footed sister showed no mercy as she skillfully bobbed and weaved through traffic to accomplish her mission. It was also mission accomplished on our exhausting, but wonderfully memorable, vacation.( As it turned out, my wife 's rule went by the boards. This trip was neither too long nor too short. It was just right.) Margaret had started a great little tradition when Trevor first began to talk. After any family outing-the beach, playground, Nana 's house, etc. -on the ride home, she 'd ask, " Who had fun today? " A resounding chorus of " M-e-e-e-e-e! " would inevitably follow. We 'd done it each day of this vacation, with the same positive result. As we headed for the Interstate( and home) the next morning, she posed the question one more time. " So, who had fun on our vacation? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically blew the roof off our mini-van. It was a sweet sound, indeed. * Photograph Youngsters exhibit their driving skills, as well as bumping aggression, in cars that are not attached to any sort of track on the Rugrats Toonpike at Kings Dominion, Doswell, Va.
