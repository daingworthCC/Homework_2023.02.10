2001641 On the face of it, Lenora B. Fulani, a 42-year-old African American woman who 's running for president, should be the progressive woman 's dream candidate. Running on a platform that calls for economic democracy, national health care, women 's rights, reproductive freedom, and gay rights, she 's articulate, telegenic, and media savvy. But for many, the dream turns into a nightmare when they learn she 's a candidate and chair of the New Alliance Party( NAP), based in New York City. Cofounded by self-styled psychologist Fred Newman, NAP had ties in the early 1970s to the right-wing fanatic Lyndon LaRouche and a number of other conservative groups. NAP has allegedly broken with LaRouche, but the controversy remains. Is NAP really a progressive group, as it claims? Although NAP describes itself as a " black-led, women-led, multiracial, pro-gay, independent political organization, " you 'd be hard-pressed to find any progressive organization -- gay, straight, black, white, whatever -- that will align with NAP. Lenora Fulani, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class family from Chester, Pennsylvania. Fulani was the first member of her family to attend college -- which she likens to " going to Hollywood, it was such a major step " -- and eventually earned her doctorate in psychology from the City University of New York. " There was a lot of devastation, poverty, pain, and craziness in my family, " says Fulani. " I was looking for a psychology that had some relevance to the black community and to poor people, and I just hated Freud. " In the late 1970s, a colleague at Rockefeller University took her to hear Fred Newman. What she found was Newman 's social therapy, which promotes the belief that external social/political conditions are largely responsible for individual psychological problems. These problems are resolved through a combination of " social therapy " and " self-empowering work, " sometimes in one of NAP 's political organizations. It is this philosophy, linking " therapy " with " politics, " that leads critics to call NAP a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exact membership figures, NAP, with chapters in 30 states, claims to be the fourth-largest political party in the U.S., after the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Libertarians. And Fulani has been its main candidate and spokeswoman. Since she joined the New Alliance Party in the early 1980s, Fulani has been running for office. She campaigned first for lieutenant governor of New York state in 1982, then for governor, New York City mayor, and president of the United States in 1988. That year, Fulani became the only female candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, winning over 200,000 votes -- no small feat for a woman running as an Independent. This year, Fulani raised enough funds to qualify for $1,150,000 in federal matching funds. NAP and Fulani say that they raised the money through a network of 200 volunteers( many of them allegedly therapy patients) who collected 40,000 contributions door-to-door, mostly in New York City and California. But NAP, critics say, misrepresents itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupting, and making money off existing organizations. " They talk about democracy, fighting sexism and racism, but their style across the country has been to disrupt community-based groups that are fighting on these issues, " says Chip Berlet, an analyst at Political Research Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the author of Clouds Blur the Rainbow, a study of NAP. " They are willing to let the end justify the means. Are they a sinister force of the right or of the government? I do n't see that here. This is a group on the left that has gone bad. " For instance, Berlet cites the 1984 presidential campaign, when Jesse Jackson, head of the Rainbow Coalition, first ran for president. Simultaneously, NAP formed the Rainbow Lobby, which raised money for international projects. Jackson was forced to publicly disavow any connection with NAP or the lobby. Other groups have their own stories. NAP tried to overrun groups -- such as the New Jewish Agenda, Peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by staging mass walkouts of their meetings, forming new groups with similar names and acronyms, and scheduling meetings at the same time. NAP also gets low grades from activists in New York City. Although NAP claims to sponsor literacy projects and cultural activities, critics say the party 's presence in the city 's African American community is nothing more than blue smoke and mirrors. Jitu Weusi, a longtime political activist in Brooklyn and chair of African-Americans United for Political Power, a citywide organization, worked with NAP in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly around efforts to remove New York City Mayor Edward Koch from office. But Weusi broke with NAP over what he calls its " chicanery. " Weusi says, " NAP tried to co-opt the dump Koch movement. They tried to say they were the crusade. They tried to exclude all of the other groups that were a part of that movement. " In this year 's presidential election, NAP has made itself felt through guerrilla tactics. Kate McGovern, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire Citizen Action, had a run-in with Fulani and NAP during the 1992 New Hampshire primary campaign. Fulani disrupted a Democratic presidential candidates forum on health care, cosponsored by McGovern 's group. Fulani, sitting in the audience, shouted the candidates down, criticizing the forum as too narrow because only the established candidates were invited to speak. But McGovern disagrees. She says NAP was allowed to attend in limited numbers -- 20 people -- just like any other group. NAP, however, snuck about 50 very vocal members into the meeting, McGovern says. " There is no way that number of supporters would have been admitted to the forum -- had they clearly identified themselves, " McGovern says. " I think ' used ' and ' duped ' characterize my feelings. You want to believe you can trust people who present themselves as progressives, but I find it difficult to believe that Fulani 's interested in opposing the right wing in a serious way. " Despite such criticism, NAP and Fulani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1989, U.S. lesbian and gay groups banded together to ask the International Lesbian and Gay Association to reject the New Alliance Party 's bid for membership. In a letter, U.S. groups criticized what they called NAP 's anti-AIDS policy, its homophobia, and Fulani 's takeover of gay rallies in San Francisco and San Diego for campaign speeches. Fulani dismisses such criticism ; she sees a sinister alliance between the Democratic party and " Social Democrats who play the role in their community as progressives, but their real role is to make sure that nothing outside the Democratic party develops. " I make a distinction between the community and the so-called left forces or the black liberal community, the leadership, because I think it 's a very important difference, " she responds when asked about the negative reputation NAP has among African American leadership. Fulani insists that " ordinary people, the rank and file, " support NAP. " NAP is teaching black people about alternatives to the Democratic party, and the importance of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says. " I think the black male establishment in this country has been really co-opted. They 're covering for their friends in the Democratic party at the expense of black people. " But Weusi points out that in New York 's 1990 governor 's race, of the nine parties that ran candidates, NAP challenged only the two black groups. This time around, Fulani attempted to have Democratic hopeful Paul Tsongas thrown off the presidential ballot in the New York April 7 primary, charging that he lacked the 10,000 signatures required. So is NAP for real? " I do n't doubt the sincerity of these people in terms of their dream, but their structure and style is in contradiction to that dream, " says critic Berlet. But NAP 's success, Berlet says, demonstrates the alienation and ineffectiveness of much of the leftist movement. " Overwhelmingly, the progressive social change movement in this country has abandoned the people NAP seeks to organize. That 's a real criticism of the left. " Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p>
