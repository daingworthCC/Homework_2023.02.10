2034641 Section : family healthy home The right lighting can boost your mood and improve your health <p> Mariana Figueiro 's home and much of her morning routine are designed with an unusual goal in mind : to ensure that she gets her daffy dose of light. <p> " I do think of it as a dose, and when I get it, I feel better, " says Figueiro, PhD, a light researcher and an adjunct assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 's Lighting Research Center in Troy, NY. Though she does n't have seasonal affective disorder( SAD), the so-called winter blues, Figueiro says she and most people sleep, concentrate, and feel better when exposed to a lot of light early in the day. <p> Twenty-five years ago, researchers discovered that bright light could relieve SAD, which strikes when the days are short. Call it the dawn of research into the health benefits of light. Since then, scientists have found that exposure to the right kind of light at the right time of day can help treat depression that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even boost concentration and performance. <p> Unfortunately, no one yet knows precisely what the ideal dose might be. But getting lots of bright light in the morning and relatively little in the evening seems to synchronize your body 's circadian rhythms -- your patterns of sleepiness, wakefulness, alertness, and hormone production -- with the 24-hour solar day around which our lives are organized. <p> Although much of the research in this field has investigated the effects of special light boxes and experimental lightbulbs in the laboratory, there 's reason to believe that you can reap some of the benefits of light in your own home. " A couple of studies show that people who get more light exposure during the day have fewer sleep problems and less depression, and evidence suggests that light can keep you alert and productive, " says Daniel Kripke, MD, a University of California, San Diego, light and sleep expert. For example, a 2004 study of more than 450 women found that those who got the most light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep. <p> A 30-minute outdoor walk each morning is a good start, but it is n't the only way you can, or should, get the light you need, says Figueiro. Here 's what to do indoors. <p> <p> Get some morning light Eat breakfast near a window that gets plenty of daylight, says Figueiro, whose dining table is in front of a window. And put exercise equipment near a bright view. Some researchers speculate that combining exercise with morning light exposure may amplify light 's beneficial effects on mood, sleep, and alertness, says Anthony Levitt, MD, a University of Toronto light researcher. <p> <p> Brighten up your bathroom Anywhere you spend time in the morning should be well lit, says Figueiro, who has a window in her shower. Try a few broad-spectrum or bluish-white compact fluorescent or halogen bulbs in or around your shower and mirror. These bulbs provide light that more closely resembles daylight than what 's emitted by traditional pear-shaped incandescent lightbulbs. They cast a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures. If you do n't have a window in your kitchen or in other spots where you spend time in the morning, add a couple of broad-spectrum fluorescents or halogens in those areas, too. Insider tip : Fit some fixtures with these bright bulbs, and others with softer incandescent bulbs, which emit a less intense yellowish light. Turn on the former in the morning and use the latter in the evening, when it 's better to avoid bright light. <p> <p> Vary the source A single bulb rarely provides sufficient light in a room and can contribute to( temporary but annoying) eyestrain. Shoot for at least two sources per room, including " task lamps, " such as undercabinet lights in the kitchen and crane-neck lamps over desks. Consider undercabinet plug-ins, such as GE 's Profile( $22). <p> <p> Get a better bounce Torchieres, wall sconces, and track lights that angle bulbs at the ceiling or walls will reflect light off these surfaces, diffusing and softening it, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy-to-install, adhesive-backed Valo halogen track lights( $49). <p> <p> Dim after 6 PM Because avoiding bright light in the evening also helps keep your circadian rhythms in sync with the 24hour day, use just enough light to read and eat comfortably by, says Levitt. <p> <p> Soften your computer screen Basking in the glow of a computer screen for 3 or more hours late at night can disrupt your circadian rhythms, making it harder to fall asleep, says Figueiro. Lots of work to finish after 9 PM? Set the brightness of your screen halfway between maximum and minimum. <p> <p> Dress, but do n't overdress, your windows Leave your bedroom curtains open a crack upon retiring. That will allow the light of dawn to shine in and filter through your eyelids( they do n't block all light). Research suggests that this can help keep your sleep/wake cycles on track, too. If light from nearby streetlamps or homes keeps you from getting a good night 's sleep, however, close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This lamp turns on at a preset time and gradually brightens, says Michael Terman, PhD, a Columbia University professor and light researcher. In a 2002 study of 125 adults with winter depression, Terman and colleagues found, among other things, that use of dawn simulators helped lift moods. The light-serotinin connection <p> How light keeps our circadian rhythms in sync is still a mystery. But some findings suggest that it affects the activity of serotonin, the " feel-good " brain chemical targeted by antidepressants like Prozac. Serotonin is also a precursor to melatonin, a hormone associated with sleep, explains Anthony Levitt, MD, a light researcher at the University of Toronto. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : " Task lamps " work for home desks <p> PHOTO( COLOR) <p> By Stacy Lu <p> <p> Freelancer Stacy Lu writes and edits in New Jersey. <p>
