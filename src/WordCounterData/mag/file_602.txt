4140741 " The future of future studies has never looked brighter. International conferences dealing with the future are now are attracting world-renowned scholars. New techniques of social and technological forecasting are developing. " # Promotional fodder for a futurist conference? Not exactly. # These hopeful words were written by Edward Cornish, in the inaugural edition of " Futurist : A Newsletter for Tomorrow 's World, " distributed for the very first time on July 1, 1966. He mailed them to readers via post on mimeographed sheets, laboriously typed. # But what is actually so striking about that first 1966 version of the Futurist, is not how old-fashioned it is. What is amazing, rather, is the profound relevance of the issues discussed. From the ethical issues surrounding the " biological revolution, " to the diplomatic challenges of protecting the global commons, to the power of computing to change radically how we organize society, the first Futurist takes up some of the most enduring of human challenges. # It all sounds strikingly familiar to me. And what it tells me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the work of futurists -- who go by many names, but share the desire to understand and work with others toward shaping desirable futures. My first three months as the WFS CEO( I took the position in July) confirm my confidence. No day goes by without affirmation that within and beyond our membership, all over the world, there are women and men eager to connect with each other in order to learn, teach, play, investigate, promote, connect and ultimately collaborate in shaping futures. # But we are also receiving member feedback that in order to support our existing members and add new ones, we need to transform, modernize and upgrade the services we offer. Most important of all, we need to guarantee that today 's futurists have access to more information and far greater direct contact with each other across the full spectrum of today 's communications platforms. # We are still at the beginning of our reorganization, but plans are already underway for a multi-year set of innovative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WFS are a major overhaul of the Futurist magazine, a revitalized website and online presence, more robust communications and newsletters, new dedicated member-only exchange networks, updated member benefits and new programs. # Once these plans come to fruition, I am confident that the future of the World Future Society could not be brighter. #
