4104641 Specialized Allez Comp Compact M2 Apex <p> $1,450 <p> Buy it if : You want to ride a century this year, but you 're worried about that long climb <p> Forget it if : You started training for the 2011 race season in 2010 <p> Weight 20.4 lb.( 58cm) <p> Sizes 49, 52, 54, 56, 58( tested), 61cm <p> Frame Specialized E5 aluminum <p> Fork Carbon fiber <p> Component highlights SRAM Apex shift/brake levers, derailleurs, crankset and cassette ; Tektro brake calipers ; Mavic CXP22 rims ; Specialized alloy hubs, 700x23 All Conditions tires, seatpost and Riva road saddle, Elite handlebar and stem <p> Performance meets all-day comfort <p> Riding the Specialized Allez brought me back to years spent in bicycle retail, helping customers who walked through the shop door thinking they should buy the same bike found under their favorite pros. While many covet the pro styling of purebred race machines, not everyone possesses the flexible hips, neck and lower back needed to tame that type of bike. Plus, not everyone needs to drop that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bikes with the vibe of a race machine but manners best suited to riders taking their first, exploratory pedal strokes, or to more experienced rouleurs seeking a bike with ride-all-day comfort and enough get-up-and-go for the local Tuesday-Night World Championships. <p> The Allez Comp Compact comes outfitted with the new SRAM Apex group( and Tektro brake calipers) and Mavic CXP22 rims. The frame is E5 aluminum, which Specialized claims to be 20 percent stiffer than 2010 's incarnation. A FACT carbon fork( with aluminum crown and steerer tube) rounds out the package. <p> The compact geometry of my 58cm test bike led to a lot of exposed seatpost to support the Specialized Body Geometry Riva Road saddle, but still put the handlebar in an easily reachable position. The bike 's tall head tube leads to a fairly upright position that 's easy on the lower back and does n't force you to crane your neck to see the road ahead. Do n't think about getting low and aero on this bike ; that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops puts you in a position that ensures you 'll be able to see over the rider ahead of you as you take in new sights on rides with friends. <p>(( pullquote)) : <p> The Allez frame is E5 aluminum, which Specialized claims to be 20 percent stiffer than 2010 's incarnation. A FACT carbon fork( with aluminum crown and steerer tube) rounds out the package. <p> The Allez will go fast when pushed, but its 20.4-pound weight means it will never be the quickest bike on the shop ride. Despite that, it is a surprisingly competent climber, owing at least in part to the low gearing of the SRAM Apex group. The compact crank( 52/36) is paired with a 12-28 cassette. It 's not the lowest gear available with Apex, but it was easy enough to let me spin up steep climbs that would have had me out of the saddle on standard gearing. <p> The upright position helps with climbing as well-putting your tongue on the front tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but sitting upright gives your lungs more of a chance to expand, helpping more oxygen get into your blood and helping power you uphill. <p> If this bike has any drawback it 's the spec-namely the Apex group and low-end Mavic wheels. The drivetrain shifted adequately in most situations, but did so noisily. The wheels felt fine rolling along but noticeably slowed my uphill progress. Despite these caveats, cyclists looking to keep up on quick rides or take longer rides will not go wrong with the Allez. -A. J.

This is shaped to optimize stiffness while still damping road chatter in a manner similar to carbon-fiber frames. Equipped with Dura-Ace components, an FSA crank, Shimano wheels and a Fi'zi:k saddle, this bike is race ready and nearly as light as carbon bikes that cost twice as much. <p> -Andrew J. Bernstein <p> Also Consider <p> Jamis Ventura Race $1,350 <p> Unusual in this category, Jamis offers an aluminum frame with slightly relaxed geometry and carbon seat-stays to damp road buzz. Angle the stem up for a comfortable ride, then flip it over and head to the throwdown. This bike is also available in a women 's configuration, offering a shorter reach and higher stem angle. -A.J.B. <p> Marin Argenta $1,350 <p> The entry from Marin 's Natural Fit lineup offers lots of value and also gives you a more upright position. A Shimano 105 group handles shifting and braking, while a triple FSA crank keeps you spinning. The bike rolls on Shimano hoops and the frame is double-butted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By mixing and matching components, Felt delivers a performance road package on this aluminum frame and carbon fork. A BB30 bottom bracket, replaceable derailleur hanger and external cable routing make the F75 an able workhorse, capable of high performance and tough enough to survive a few scrapes. -A.J.B. <p> Scott Speedster S20 $1,499 <p> Boasting nearly a full Shimano 105 lineup, this aluminum frame and carbon fork draw on Scott 's experience at the top end to deliver accessible performance. Designed to ease ambitious riders into racing, the Speedster introduces you to a go-fast stance. -A.J.B. <p> Three accessories to improve the ride <p> 1 Silca floor pumps $60-$90 <p> Floor pumps see a lot of use and Silcas withstand regular abuse better than most. All models feature an aluminum head( formerly brass) and a replaceable leather seal. A fitting lets Silcas work with both presta and Schrader valves. The pressure gauge is one of the industry 's best, reading up to 210 psi. Height and barrel volume vary depending on model. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composite base is sure underfoot. Sturdy construction offers confidence that this may be the last pump you ever buy. -A.J.B <p> 2 CamelBak Podium Chill bottle $12 <p> Insulated to keep 21 ounces of your desired refreshment cool when it 's hot out or warm when it 's cold( be careful not to burn your tongue, though), the Podium Chill insulated bottle fits nicely in both a standard cage and your hand. The Chill employs a self-sealing JetValve, delivering your beverage when the bottle is squeezed, then closing tight to prevent drips. A twist valve provides extra security when packing your prefilled bottles. Of course, it 's BPA-free. -A.J.B. <p> 3 VDO MC1.0+ computer/altimeter $125 <p> This wireless unit combines 12 features to track speed, distance and temperature, plus seven altimeter functions-for two wheel sizes. The head buttons provide a positive click. Zip-ties quickly mount the head unit and fork sensor without tools. -A.J.B. <p> Giant TCR Composite <p> $1,870 <p> Buy it if : You want to ride fast and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want obvious flash at bargain pricing <p> Weight 18.3 lb.( M/L) <p> Sizes XS, S, M, M/L( tested), L, XL <p> Frame T-600 composite <p> Fork Giant Advanced-Grade( T-700) composite, alloy tapered steerer <p> Component highlights Shimano 105 STI levers, derailleurs, compact crank, cassette ; Tektro TK-R540 brakes ; Giant P-R2 rims ; Michelin Dynamic tires ; Giant Connect bar/stem, Vector Composite seatpost, Men 's Performance Road saddle <p> Material downgrade, performance enhancement <p> Two-thousand-dollar bikes fill an important need : justifying a bike purchase to a spouse.( " Sure, it was expensive, but it could have been $8,000.... ") To meet demand, manufacturers are packing more value into bikes at that price point than at any time in recent memory. Giant 's TCR Composite, one of the best performance-driven, value-oriented road bikes we 've tested to date, is a prime example. <p> The TCR Composite is Giant 's first all-carbon road bike to cost less than $2,000, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with features such as a press-fit BB86 bottom bracket, a tapered steerer tube and asymmetrical chainstays. Compared with higher-end TCR models, Giant utilizes a lower-grade carbon fiber in the frame 's construction and replaces the outer cosmetic layer of carbon weave with black paint. Both measures add weight, but help reduce manufacturing costs. <p> Within the first few miles on our usual test route, the Composite felt as familiar as favorite jeans. We 've been fortunate enough to log many hours on Giant 's TCR Advanced SL, the high-end cousin of the Composite, and both bikes produced strikingly similar sensations. Geometry on the entire TCR line is identical, right down to the head-tube height-Giant did n't compromise the fit or handling one iota from its race-bred steeds. In addition, the Composite is stiff-not quite as efficient as its costlier cousins, but the bike is clearly intended to perform and stand up to even the strongest cyclists. <p> The TCR 's standout feature is its ride quality-typically an Achilles ' heel for value-oriented bikes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite using inexpensive materials and adding weight. This road feel sets the bike apart from other inexpensive frames that leave riders wanting to feel the road under their wheels. <p> Giant did n't skimp on the spec, either. The bike features a full Shimano 105 group mixed with surprisingly good Tektro stoppers. The cockpit feels pro right down to what looks and feels like( but is n't) Fi'zi:k 's Aliante-a perennial staff favorite. <p> At a bit over 18 pounds, the Composite 's weight is its most prominent weakness. Yet, calling it a weakness is n't really fair : The weight is average for the price point, but we noticed the difference on group rides, when we struggled to keep up with riders on lighter bikes. If every sub-$2,000 bike was stiff, rode great and hit the scales at the UCI limit, we 'd all be riding one. Barring that, hitting two out of those three attributes is still amazing. -R.K. <p> Five things to expect from a bike like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes on a carbon fork <p> Carbon or aluminum frame <p> Lower-grade wheels and tires <p> Compact-crank gearing <p> Three things to look for in a bike like this <p> Tapered steerer tube <p> Race geometry <p> Complete group spec <p> Eddy Merckx EMX-7 Limited Edition $20,000 <p> Just won the lottery? Look no further than this Merckx-the brand 's high-end offering comes with a hardcover book that celebrates the life and career of the company 's legendary founder. Even a lottery winner might feel guilty riding such a bike and should probably be sensible : Hang this one on the wall and build up an EMX-7 frameset( $6,200) instead. <p> -Ron Koch <p> Also Consider <p> Masi Evo Apex $1,850 <p> Masi 's new Evolozione carbon frame is made with a mix of carbon grades and comes with racy features such as a tapered head tube, BB30, oversized chainstays and carbon rear dropouts. Internal cable routing gives a clean look. SRAM 's Apex WiFli package offers low gears so riders can spin comfortably up almost any climb. -R.K. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new SL-2 frame that is stiffer and lighter than last year 's. Geometry is identical to the Tour-winning Tarmac SL-3. The Elite utilizes SRAM 's Apex group with an 11-28 cassette and 52/36 chainrings for a gear spread low enough for steep climbs and tall enough for tailwinds. -R.K. <p> Orbea Onix T105 $2,099 <p> Each Onix frame size features tube diameters and layup schedules specific to riders likely to be riding that size, offering a tuned ride at an accessible price. You wo n't find cheap, preprinted graphics on the Onix ; each is hand painted and available in four colors. -R.K. <p> Diamondback Podium 5 $2,100 <p> The Podium 5 's all-new carbon frame weighs just 880 grams in the 54cm size, says Diamondback. Even at this reasonable cost, the Podium 's frame is packed with must-haves, such as BB30 and a tapered head tube. Unusual at this price, the fork is all carbon. -R.K. <p> Three accessories to improve the ride <p> 1 Fi'zi:k Arione Versus saddle $150 <p> The Versus variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the center for riders who find a traditional flat saddle uncomfortable. The saddle 's base is the same as the regular Arione, but thicker foam creates a recessed channel at the cost of just a few grams. The sensation is different-it feels wider at the nose than the Arione. If you think the standard version ca n't be beat, chances are the Versus wo n't be better. If you need a little more relief, the channel may make you a believer. -R.K. <p> 2 Lazer Helium Road Warrior Edition helmet $250 <p> Lazer 's Helium Road Warrior Edition helmet is available in three national color schemes : Belgian, Italian or Russian. The package comes with an aero shell and cycling cap but costs just $20 more than the standard Helium-the cost of an aero shell alone. The clear aero shell shows off the custom graphics and helps cut wind drag, also beneficial in cold or wet conditions. -R.K. <p> 3 Continental Gran Prix 4000 S tires $70 <p> The handmade 4000 S utilizes a tacky rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 26 percent less rolling resistance and 30 percent improvement to traction with a 5 percent longer life span may sound like marketing hype, but our ride impressions suggest that they may be accurate. Since it costs the same as the standard Gran Prix 4000, buying the superior S model is really a no-brainer. -R.K.
