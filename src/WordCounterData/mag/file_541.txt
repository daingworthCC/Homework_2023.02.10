4109541 You do n't need a treestand or pop-up blind to arrow a deer <p> IT WAS THE FIRST time I 'd ever aimed up at a whitetail. I was kneeling in a depression, and a horse-faced doe stood six steps away. When the arrow hit home, she tore off, kicking snow inches from me. I might have been more excited if it 'd been a huge buck from a treestand. But I do n't think so. <p> Call it freestyle ground hunting-a retro tactic that has a growing number of bowhunters rediscovering the excitement of a nearly lost craft. In the 1970s, elevated stands revolutionized the sport. A decade ago, pop-up blinds brought us down from the trees. Now, more and more hunters are leaving these enclosures to fool whitetails using nothing more than stealth, skill, and good camo. Fred Bear would smile. <p> Be Mobile Treestands and pop-up blinds, while effective, have a downside : " You spend hours reading sign and picking an ambush site. Then you sit in Stand A and watch your buck use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has arrowed four net B &C; bucks by still-hunting from the ground in a gillie suit. Years ago, Anthony climbed out of his stand to kill a huge buck that had passed out of range. " I 've been done with stands ever since. " <p> Other ground pounders, like myself and Neil Dougherty of North Country Whitetails in New York( see " Gust, Swirl, Shift, Snort, " p. 64), have n't so much given up on stands and blinds as we are eager to freestyle if it makes sense. When deer are hard to pattern, when they can be spotted in patchwork cover, when you need to quickly adjust to fickle winds, or when there are no suitable stand trees, sitting on the ground lets you hedge your bets. " If you guess right and your buck walks within range, great, " says Dougherty. " If not, you can quickly make a move. You need to be very careful of the wind at ground level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with if you keep that in your favor, use available cover, and take your time. " <p> Get the Shot Here are four tips for getting close, getting drawn, and making the shot on an eye-level whitetail : <p> 1 Remember the saying, " Cover behind makes the best blind. " To ambush a buck from the ground, set up so you have mostly unobstructed shooting in front and good cover to the rear that breaks up your silhouette. I killed an Iowa 8-pointer years ago by backing up against a blowdown. I arrowed the doe mentioned above from in front of an upturned root ball. Dougherty likes to tuck himself into a brushy hedgerow or thicket. <p> 2 You can pull this tactic off with standard camo, but if, like Anthony, you will do more stalking than sitting, go with 3-D leaf camo or a gillie suit( see sidebar). <p> 3 Bring a portable stool or seat. It 's more comfortable than sitting on the ground and makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieu of this, clear an area of leaf litter in front of you so you can quietly kneel to shoot. If you 're still-hunting or stalking, shoot from your knees, which makes it harder for deer to recognize your form. <p> 4 Getting drawn without getting busted can be the toughest part. When setting up an ambush, mentally mark the spots-a wide tree trunk, some low brush-where a buck 's vision might be obstructed. You may need to draw early. On the other hand, if a buck surprises you, let him walk past, and doublelung him as he 's quartering away.
