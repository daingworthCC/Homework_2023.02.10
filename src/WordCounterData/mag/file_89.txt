2011041 The supermodel and single mom talks about her relationship with Seal, how pregnancy changed her body, and why she wants to be a hands-on mom. // Picture Heidi Klum, and three words probably jump to mind : Victoria 's secret model. But in the past few years, Klum has taken on a whole slew of roles that do n't require silk undies or velvet bras. The German-born 31-year-old is also an entrepreneur, with her own line of baubles for fine jeweler Mouawad, a shoe line for Birkenstock, fat-free candy sold through German confectioner Katjes, and Otto, a clothing line in Germany. In December, Klum added television host to her resume with the launch of Project Runway on Bravo, a show featuring budding fashion designers competing for money to fund their own line. And with her new book, Heidi Klum 's Body of Knowledge : 8 Rules of Model Behavior( to Help You Take Off on the Runway of Life), Klum can claim the title of author as well. But Heidi 's most important new job is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty public breakup with boyfriend Flavio Briatore last year, Klum gave birth to the couple 's daughter in May 2004. Before you could say " new single mom, " Klum met and started dating R &B; singer Seal, who has since moved into Klum 's New York apartment-and taken on his fair share of dirty diapers. With all the recent changes in her life, we wanted to know, What are Heidi Klum 's secrets to multitasking success? ON FULFILLING GOALS : " You do n't always have to go through the front door to get what you want. " There 's a back door you can try, or you can climb a tree and try to get into the house. People always push you down ; you have to be strong. For example, my modeling agency once told me, " You 're a good catalog model, but you wo n't ever do magazines. You will never be on the cover of Vogue. " They said I was too girl-next-door. And now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my list. My book 's message is about trying different things and not being afraid of getting pushed back sometimes. It 's about being creative to get ahead. ON RAISING A CHILD SOLO : " I do n't consider myself a single mom. " We have a family. Seal sings lullabies to Leni. He makes up stuff. If she does a big fart, then he sings about the fart. Or if her poop is green, the song 's about green poop. Or if she smiles, and her eyes are really blue and sparkly, then it 's about blue, sparkly eyes. He helps change the diapers. He is as 100 percent as I am. He 's a great, great help. He 's my Superman. ON THE HOME FRONT : " It 's like Babies " R " Us in my house. " I have everything. I have a Bugaboo Stroller and a BabyBjrn. So many people sent gifts, and I bought a lot of stuff, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed. But it 's good. I love it. ON PREGNANCY : " It 's amazing what your body is capable of ". I breast-feed, and my boobs got gigantic for about two weeks. I thought, I 'm not going to be able to handle this. And then they just went back to normal. My body is still not the same size. But I 'm not a nut about losing weight. The body does wonders. It bounces back, like stretchy rubber. ON " DIETING " : " Models eat. " You sit down for dinner with friends, and there 's someone new there, and they say, " Wow, you chow down a lot of food! I did n't think models ate that much. " It 's such a clich. We just eat differently. I work out, eat well, drink water, sleep enough, and do n't party too much. I might eat a big steak and a big salad, and I 'll still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity is a lot, but the quality is good. I do n't eat a lot of heavy sauces and pile on the pasta and eat bread that I dip into oil. If you do that, you might as well slap the fat on your cheeks right away, because that 's what does it. ON RELATIONSHIP LESSONS : " Do n't try to be someone that you 're not. " Sooner or later, the truth will come out anyway. I 've known people who have been a certain way, and then all of a sudden I was surprised by what that person turned into-or by what they always were, but they were n't that way when I met them. I was like, Wait a minute, this is not the same person that I fell in love with. Who are you? ON PARENTING : " I 'm not someone who always travels everywhere with a nanny. " I like to be hands-on and raise my daughter. Leni has been to Europe three times already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she gets up every three to four hours. People look when she 's screaming, so I walk up and down the aisle, and I talk to her. I make funny faces. It 's a whole different thing. Before, I would have a little bag with just my stuff-my purse, my phone, things like that. Now I have a huge bag with toys and bottles and diapers. ON HER EXPECTATIONS FOR LENI : " Would I ever say to Leni, " I really want for you to be a model? ' No, I would not. I would n't have anything against it, but she has to want it. I would be by her side if she wanted to be a model, but I do n't want to put any ideas anywhere, ever. I 'm here to help her get bigger and to raise her. She has to live her own life. ON BEING ONE OF THE GIRLS : " I just want to be seen as a goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs. " Maybe my life is, to the public, a little bit glamorous. But we change diapers the same way other people do. When we travel, we lug around bottles and burp the baby and feed her. I would love to have more kids. The one tiling I would wish for? More time. But otherwise, I 'm very happy. Sidebar " I do n't consider myself a single mom. We have a family. Seal sings lullabies to Leni. He helps change the diapers. " // <p>
