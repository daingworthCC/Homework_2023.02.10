4182441 <p> After enduring a bruising selloff in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump 's unexpected electoral victory, Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen significantly since the beginning of the year. <p> The yield on the 10-year note has shed nearly 30 basis points, or just over a quarter of a percentage point, since it peaked at 2.640% on Dec. 15. It TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.79% was up 6.4 basis points at 2.386% on Thursday. <p> On Wednesday, Treasurys cemented their longest winning streak since June 28, a period that coincided with the U.K. 's vote to leave the European Union. That vote, which was widely discounted by investors, rattled stock markets and sparked a rush of assets into safety plays like high-grade sovereign debt, gold and the yen. <p> While it 's not the only " Trump trade " that 's seen a significant reversal since the beginning of the year, the move is indicative of investors ' shifting views on the pace of growth, inflation and President Donald Trump 's ability to enact the economic policies he touted during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to enact <p> After the election, investors hoped that Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress would swiftly implement the president 's economic agenda, a slate of policies that include a massive infrastructure spending bill, corporate tax cuts and deregulation. <p> But it has n't quite worked out that way. Trump said Thursday that a " major " announcement about his tax policies would be forthcoming some time during the next few weeks, but he 's provided scant details about his plans for ramping up spending. <p> And infighting in Congress over his cabinet nominees has convinced investors that implementing Trump 's agenda might take longer than previously believed, said Larry Milstein, a managing director of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich &amp; Co. <p> " Obviously there is still talk of tax reform and infrastructure spending but if you read between the lines it looks like it wo n't be until the summer of fall, " he said. <p> This is problematic because many forecasters, including some members of the Fed 's interest-rate setting committee, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In December, a plurality of Fed policy makers said they expect to raise interest rates three times in 2017. Since the U.S. labor market is already near full employment, economists expect that tax cuts and stimulus spending would create jobs in the near term, jacking up wages and consumer-price inflation. <p> With inflation expected to rise more quickly than previously believed, the Fed would need to raise rates to stop the economy from overheating. <p> But if it takes Trump longer to implement these policies, the attendant boost to inflation and growth will take longer to materialize, allowing the central bank to leave rates lower for longer. <p> Typically, bond investors will demand a higher yield on their investments when they expect interest rates or inflation to rise. <h> The oil rally has stalled <p> Along with expectations surrounding Trump 's policy priorities, a sharp rise in commodity prices in the second half of 2016 also helped boost inflation expectations. <p> But since the beginning of the year, crude oil and copper, two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has helped tamp down expectations for inflation over the short term, said Bruno Braizinha, an interest-rate at Soci? t? G? n? rale. <p> " We 're basically moving sideways on the big bellwethers of the reflation move, " he said. <p> Indeed, the decline in Treasury yields earlier this week coincided with a sharp drop in oil prices. <p> On Thursday, crude oil futures CLH7, +0.11% traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange were trading at $52.99 a barrel, a decline of 1.3% year to date. Meanwhile, copper HGH7, -0.04% traded on the London Mercantile Exchange has risen 6% this year to $5,865 a ton, but it is little changed from its postelection level. <h> Wages are n't rising, which means prices likely wo n't either <p> Friday 's disappointing reading on average hourly wage growth was perhaps the most significant catalyst of this week 's decline in Treasury yields. <p> " The market was preparing for three rate increases. But if these inflation numbers continue, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comiskey, managing director of Treasury trading at Scotiabank. <p> Since Friday 's report, the 5-year, 5-year forward inflation expectation rate, a measure of expected inflation, on average, over the five-year period that begins five years from now, has fallen sharply, hitting 2.13% Thursday from 2.19%. <h> Short squeeze <p> Treasurys have been relatively resilient since the start of the year -- but that has n't stopped speculators from increasing their bets that the value of these bonds will fall. <p> According to the latest report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the aggregate short position of speculators and hedge funds was $12.6 billion. This data only incorporates bets placed on U.S. futures exchanges. <p> The move lower in yields following Friday 's wage number likely forced some of these traders to close out their positions by buying back Treasurys, driving the price higher, and yields lower. This phenomenon is known as a short squeeze. <p> " The rally you saw earlier in the week just smelled of a short squeeze, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains, some signs of exhausting are already beginning to emerge. <p> An auction of $23 billion in 10-year notes earlier in the week received surprisingly week demand, suggesting that there is not much appetite to buy Treasurys at their present levels. Instead, the outcome suggests that investors are waiting for more information out of Washington before they jump back in, Milstein said. <p> " We 're sitting here, like everybody else, waiting to hear more news out of Washington D.C., " he said.
