4107441 ONE KEY TO NORMAN ROCKWELL 'S tremendous success was his uniquely finetuned ability to listen to creative and constructive advice he invited from the people around him- family, friends, boss, even his models. <p> Friends and newcomers to his studio were greeted by the characteristically humble Rockwell with a warm welcome and hello- some undoubtedly surprised to find themselves immortalized in one of his canvases. <p> Two such visitors were Patricia and Donald, young adults living in New Rochelle the artist cast as models for the March 12, 1921 cover painting titled The Palm Reader. <p> Keeping Up with New Trends <p> The idea of featuring palm reading on the cover stirred some controversy in the Post editorial offices- the practice was banned in some small towns. But palm reading was a new fad, and Posf editor George Horace Lorimer asked Rockwell to give it his best shot. The final painting shows the couple at a party entertaining themselves- she traces lines on his hand, while he ponders his options( or exit strategy). Speaking of quick exits, a quick escape was certainly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country road on one of Rockwell 's most famous illustrations No Swimming, published June 4, 1921. <p> Franklin Lischke- the freckle-faced lad in the middledid n't have to go far out of his way to pose for this picture. His father owned the building in New Rochelle that the artist used as a studio. If the boy was n't modeling, Norman found other duties for Franklin. Over time, his interest in Rockwell 's work grew, inspiring him to study art and make it his career. Franklin eventually became an established commercial artist in New York City specializing in fashion illustration for stores like Bloomingdale 's and Saks. I had an opportunity to interview a much older Franklin at length. He recalled how Rockwell always encouraged models to share feedback about his paintings. <p> Rockwell also received suggestions from his leading admirer- George Lorimer. In fact, it was Lorimer who inspired Rockwell to create JVo Swimming for the cover. Seeing the finished work, Lorimer told Rockwell, " Whatever it is that the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time. " <p> Nearly 90 years later, people are still guessing. Take a look at the picture and see if you can figure out what prompted the three boys ' decision to scamper off so quickly. Could it have been the pond owner, an irritated bull, or a group of passing girls? <p> Sorry, none of the above. <p> Lorimer gave his answer to Norman. Norman told Franklin. And Franklin shared it with me. What 's the real answer? Stay tuned- the secret will be revealed next issue. <p> LOVE ROCKWELL?
