4176741 <h> The Birth of a Nation Overcomes Its Faults with Its Striking Passion <p> It 's impossible to argue with the righteousness of The Birth of a Nation, **29;101;TOOLONG Nate Parker 's rumbling Nat Turner biopic, which premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival on Monday. There is, of course, the inherent power of its story : the 1831 rebellion led by Turner, a Virginian slave, was a watershed moment in the fight against American slavery, and Parker mightily captures the event 's seismic importance in rousing fashion. There 's also the stirring fact that this film, a long-gestating labor of something beyond love for Parker, finally got made. The effusive audience response at the festival, and the huge sale of the film, helps illustrate that this is a neccesary work with exceeding cultural value, at a time when America 's pervasive, systematic racism still harms so many, still poisions our political and cultural institutions -- the film industry included. The Birth of a Nation glows with that dual fury ; it 's an unblinking historical account of a bloody, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the here and now. <p> Which, frankly, all goes a long way toward overcoming the film 's many imperfections. Chiefly, the film suffers from an impulse to encompass too much scope and story. Parker directs with a sure hand, but his screenplay has a lopsided structure, with Turner 's 48-hour rebellion and its horrific aftermath only occupying about the last 30 or so minutes of the film. What comes before is filled with striking images and wrenching scenes -- especially as Turner travels from plantation to plantation, ministering to fellow slaves and witnessing the horrors visited upon them -- but too much of it feels digressive, like Parker is spinning his wheels, poking around here and there, until he can get to the meat of the story. As Turner 's wife, Cherry, Aja Naomi King does fine work, but her and Nat 's courtship takes up a curiously large amount of time, only for her character to be summarily relegated to bedridden suffering so that Turner can be spurred into action. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner and his alcoholic master, played with ugly teeth and little depth by Armie Hammer. <p> The film also has a recurring dream motif that it does n't need, despite the fact that the real-life Turner is said to have been inspired by visions. Turner 's religious and spiritual conviction, his disarming passion and fervor, is rendered perfectly well by Parker 's fiery performance, his sermons and recitations of Bible passages delivered with boom and portent.( I would really like to see Nate Parker do some Shakespeare onstage. His St. Crispin 's Day speech could really be something.) The vision sequences thus play as unnecessary embellishments in a film that already has plenty style and muscle, and a few even have the unfortunate side effect of showing the seams of this tightly budgeted film. There 's also the problem of Henry Jackman 's score, its generic swells and plaints having the canned quality of stock music. In one scene toward the end of the film, Parker sets a gruesome, dexterously shot tableau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief, tantalizing taste of what this film might sound like with some more judicious music choices. <p> So, a perfect film this is not. But in a strange way, the film 's stumbles, its errant moments of messiness, make it feel all the more vital. The film 's most recent analogue, Steve McQueen 's Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, is a polished, exquisite piece of art, one so measured and formalist that it occasionally risks remoteness. The Birth of a Nation, in contrast, is overflowing and immediate, a crescendoing roar from the gut. We need films like this as much as we need the high art, to stir in us something more visceral than intellectual. Since the film premiered here in Park City, many comparisons to Braveheart have been bandied about. It 's an apt comparison in some ways -- like that film, The Birth of a Nation is a crowd-pleasing revolution epic from a passionate auteur -- but Braveheart is ancient, discrete history compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will leave the film feeling inspired and encouraged, others will feel the burning shame of legacy and complicity. But Parker generously calls to all with his rallying cry of a film, a weighty invocation of past bravery that charges its audience with the essential, nation-defining mission of fighting for a better and more just future.
