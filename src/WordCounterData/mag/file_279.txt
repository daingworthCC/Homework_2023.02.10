Left, while bagel purists will argue that the only real bagel is plain, poppy seed or sesame seed, the nontraditional flavors such as spinach and cinnamon have gained fans.

If you 've ever been in a neighborhood bagel bakery and savored a steaming-hot, fresh-from-the-oven bagel, you know the feeling. This is the ultimate comfort food-a comfort to taste, chew, hold and enjoy. It 's the teddy bear of foods. And it may be safe to say that bagel lovers are, by nature, a good-humored lot. Even commuters, faced with the morning rush hour at a time when good humor is hard to come by can smile over a customary breakfast of bagels with cream cheese, jelly or any other of the numerous toppings that help busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagel has always been with us in the morning. Admittedly, it does have a long if not well-documented history. The most prevalent tale about the bagel 's origin is this : In 1683 in Vienna, Austria, a Jewish baker wanted to thank Poland 's King Jan III Sobieski for protecting his countrymen from the invading Turks during the Battle of Vienna. The king 's favorite pastime was horseback riding, so, in his honor, the baker created a special hard roll in the shape of a stirrup-known as a bugel in Austrian. But even earlier than that, at the beginning of the 160Os, a round bread known in Poland as a beygls was gifted to pregnant women and women after childbirth, regardless of their religious affiliation. The bagel has long been a favorite in the Jewish community. In the early 190Os, many eastern European Jewish immigrants settled in New York City, Montreal and Toronto. These cities became centers for neighborhood bagel baking. In the 192Os, baker Harry Lender opened shop-Lenders Beigel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish delicatessens in Manhattan. When his sons Murray and Marvin took over the bagel business and started flashfreezing their bagels, the boys helped turn the local bagel into a nationwide, mainstream bread. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, bagel bakers from New York and the surrounding areas began moving to other parts of the country. By the late 198Os, companies such as Sara Lee and later Thomas 's, both noted for producing such baked goods as cakes and muffins, and other bakeries began expanding their product lines to include bagels. Even fast food chains put bagels on their menus, and clever entrepreneurs such as Einstein Bros have taken the bagel nationwide with outlets devoted to bagel-inspired sandwiches and shmears.

Its the distinctive texture that characterizes it. And it 's the only bread product that is boiled before it is baked, a process called kettling. That 's what gives the bagel its unique crust and shine. But this traditional technique may soon become a thing of the past, says Adam Pomerantz, who, with his brother Matt, have become New York City bagel mavens and co-owners of Murray 's Bagels, a two-store group in downtown Manhattan. In the interest of mass production, many large-scale bagel producers steam rather than boil their bagels prior to baking. The result may be a softer bagel that lends itself more readily to sandwich making. But there 's a limit as to how much reduced " chew " a bagel lover will tolerate. Bagel buyers can tell the real thing, says Pomerant/. Steamed bagels, set on perforated metal proof boards, show little round circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes a good bagel? Think TA-TA, an acronym that stands for the 4 characteristics for assessing bagel quality. Texture-the bagel should be slightly chewy and offer some resistance when you bite into it. Appearance-the bagel should be baked golden with a small center hole. Taste-if a plain, unadorned bagel is flavorful, than you 've made the right choice. Aroma-a good bagel smells like a good bagel. You 'll know it when you smell it, because it surrounds you like a warm hug. When you buy fresh bagels, freeze what you 're not using right away. You can toast your bagels frozen, or, if you want to recreate that warm bagel-bakery feeling, heat them with the halves pressed together to make a whole bagel in the oven for 5 minutes at 375F. Whichever bagel flavor you prefer, be sure to slice each carefully, which means definitely not in midair.

Sidebar After pursuing a few other careers, Adam Pomerantz and his brother Matt wanted to recapture some childhood memories : They craved the flavors of bagels past. " We grew up in a very New York-Jewish family, " says Adam Pomerantz. " We knew all about bagels and smoked fish. This was our soul food. " But as adults, neither brother could find an appetizing old-fashioned bagel in Manhattan. Their solution? Open Murray 's Bagels. They spent months researching their bagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bagels to the best flour for bagel making, ultimately deciding to make them the traditional way. " We stick to old-fashioned ingredients and no preservatives, " says Pomerantz, who lists the five components of a Murray 's bagel as high-gluten flour, water, yeast, barley malt syrup and salt. " Then we hand-roll every bagel. " Most bagels are machine made, are perfectly round and have a too-large hole in the middle. " The consistency will be like white bread, " Pomerantz says. But bagels need the air bubbles and pockets acquired by hand-rolling, he says. Besides, it 's a character issue. " A bagel should n't be perfect, " he says. " There is something to be said for a food product made by hand. " As for bagel trends, the brothers keep up with consumer tastes even while maintaining their old-fashioned ways. Pomerantz, who opened Murray 's 8 years ago, notes that while spinach and sun-dried-tomato bagels are popular among tourists, locals favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blueberry and cinnamon-raisin. And thanks to the low-carb trend, customers often ask for scooped-out bagels. The Pomerantz brothers know bagels, and it 's obvious : Their shops have lines out the door each morning.
