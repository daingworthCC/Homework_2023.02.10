5004441 <p> I am trying to be the sort of person who does n't gossip about her own friends ' relationships -- a difficult task for me, coming from long line of yentas -- so instead I will focus my energy on Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, two people who are probably used to the attention. Today 's important piece of news : Kaitlynn Carter has met Miley 's mom. Folks, it 's serious( maybe)( who knows). <p> According toPage Six, Cyrus and her new alleged love interest " grabbed lunch " with Tish Cyrus in Los Angeles on Saturday, having returned from their much-publicized Italian lovecation. Peoplereports that the hang was just one of many in Cyrus and Carter 's increasingly intensifying relationship : <p> " Miley is very close with Kaitlynn. It 's romantic, but it 's also a friendship, " the source said. " They are both going through similar stuff right now and are bonding over it. " <p> Advertisement <p> Meanwhile, Peoplesays Hemsworth was spotted over the weekend at a bar in Australia, many thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best. Cyrus reportedly misses Hemsworth now that she 's been freed from Italy 's aphrodisiac grip, per one of her blabbermouth friends : <p> " Miley is okay, but you can tell she is n't 100 percent happy. They had many happy days together in L.A. and now Liam is not around, " the source said. " It 's hard for her to be back in L.A. without him. This is not the situation that she wanted. She hoped they could figure things out. " <p> Not that I know Cyrus or Hemsworth personally( and if I did, per my new no-gossiping rules, I would n't be able to speculate on this at all). But as I have pointed out previously, it seems like maybe they should n't get back together, in part because nothing good ever comes from miserable never-ending breakups and brief reconciliations, and also because their relationship sounds like one big mess.
