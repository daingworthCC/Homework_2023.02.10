4181941 <p> The long-held assumption that children will be better off than their parents were appears to be faltering. <p> Americans are not very optimistic about their children 's financial futures. Only 37% of Americans believe today 's children will grow up to be better off than their parents were financially, a sentiment unchanged since 2013, according to a recent survey by Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. " It is very hard for people to thrive when health-care, housing and education costs are so high, " said David Grasso, the editor of GenFKD, an education and economy advocacy group for millennials. " Those are three realities threatening the ability for present and future generations to thrive. " <p> Americans are n't the only people pessimistic about future generations ' finances. Canadians are n't very hopeful, nor are those in France, Greece, Japan, Australia, Kenya and Mexico. Overall, a median of 41% of residents in countries Pew surveyed believe children in their country will be better off. The gloomy outlooks comes even as people view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example, said the economic standing of the U.S. was good in a separate Pew survey earlier this year. Pew interviewed about 40,000 residents in 38 countries. <p> Older Americans are much more pessimistic than younger ones -- 61% of Americans 50 and older say the next generation is in trouble. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, less than half( 49%) believe even younger Americans will be worse off. Older Americans in particular may have trouble envisioning a future free from a housing market that would have been out of reach to them in their 20s and 30s, stagnant wage growth and student debt that has tripled to $1.3 trillion from $481 billion a decade ago, Grasso said. Not to mention modern society 's obsession with smartphones. <p> One possible reason for the downbeat assessment of young people 's future could be that millennials are n't as well-off as their parents were when their parents were their age, according to a report from Young Invincibles, an advocacy group for young Americans. That 's in part because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Invincibles report. The report analyzed Federal Reserve Board of Governors public surveys from 1989 and 2013 and found millennials earn lower incomes than their parents did. <p> But they also face a host of financial constraints that previous generations did n't. Millennials have a reputation for delaying marriage and homebuying and living at home with their parents for longer than any generation before them, but there 's more to it : Sometimes, they stay home to help their parents, or save for a down payment on a house. But younger Americans ' lack of worry about the future also means they 're saving less for retirement. <h> Mortgage Rates <p> Powered by <p> This advertisement is provided by Bankrate, which compiles rate data from more than 4,800 financial institutions.
