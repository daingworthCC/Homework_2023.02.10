4139641 From reproductive rights to education to the future of Black families, political writer KELI GOFF pushes past the rhetoric to find out which presidential candidatePresident Barack Obama or Gov. Mitt Romneysupports the policies that are best for you # REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS # Abortion has long been the most controversial reproductive rights issue, but this election debates over abortion( which President Obama believes should be legal and Gov. Romney does not) have been eclipsed by debates over birth control. Though children born outside of marriage now comprise more than half of American births to women under 30( and 73 percent of Black births), out-of-wedlock births remain strongly linked to poverty. The Affordable Care Act, the health care law President Obama spent much of his first term getting passed, mandates that insurers must now cover contraception without copays. # Advantage : Obama # Gov. Romney has stated that he would repeal so-called Obamacare, labeling it a government takeover that has added a trillion dollars in new health care spending, and questions when was the last time a government program actually lowered costs. He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious liberty of employers who oppose contraceptives. For Black women birth control can mean the difference between poverty and accessing the American dream. The President 's reproductive rights record is as encouraging as Romney 's is troubling. # EDUCATION # In some states dropout rates among young Black males exceed 60 percent. Since men who have dropped out of high school are 47 times more likely to be incarcerated, and the children of incarcerated men are five times more likely to end up in prison, education is a key issue, and one of the few on which President Obama and Gov. Romney agree more than they disagree. The President recently announced the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans to propel Black students for high school graduation, college completion and productive careers. # Although Gov. Romney and President Obama championed the charter school movement, they firmly disagree on vouchers. President Obama opposes the use of " vouchers " or federal funds to subsidize alternatives such as private school education. Romney not only supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to enable students the choice to attend any school( public, private, online or charter) they wish. With so many families of color facing disheartening educational opportunities, this is one issue on which Romney and the GOP get higher marks. # Advantage : Romney # STRENGTHENING BLACK FAMILIES # Bolstering all families starts with economic stability. A 2010 study found that the median wealth of single women of color is $5. Even more troubling, African-American women were 256 percent more likely than White men to receive subprime loans, meaning Black women were among those hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. President Obama has received mixed marks for his administration 's efforts at foreclosure aid( including instituting a brief moratorium on foreclosures and establishing a foreclosure prevention fund). When it comes to family dynamics, President Obama often recalls growing up with his single mother and so has made promoting family and fatherhood a policy priority through the Fatherhood Initiative and Fatherhood Buzz tour of barbershops. Both men are clearly committed to strengthening American families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tune with those voters who may define " traditional family " differently. # Advantage : Obama # As the father of five sons and 18 grandchildren, Gov. Romney stresses the importance of having a home where faith, love of country and determination are woven into every American household. He blames President Obama for the foreclosure mess and said during the GOP primary that he would opt for a do-nothing approach : " Do n't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. " Appearing before the NAACP, Romney said, " If you understood who I truly am in my heart and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president. " He also took the opportunity to talk about preserving " traditional marriage, " an attempt to draw a sharp contrast with his opponent, who supports same-sex marriage. # Why I 'm Voting for President Obama AGAIN! # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the President reelected # President Obama 's work is n't done yet. He needs a second term to complete what he started four years ago, and that ca n't happen unless we show up to vote. We 're at a unique and critical time in this country. We can either choose to go backward or choose to move forward, and moving forward requires hard work, self-reflection and investing in ourselves. And I believe that 's what President Obama 's policies are truly all about. # I 'm an Obama supporter and voter registration leader, and the onus is on the campaign to make sure that everyone knows about the progress the President has already made : During his term Pell grants and HBCU funding increased ; the Do n't Ask, Do n't Tell policy was repealed ; health care was reformed ; and the auto industry was rescued. These policies ultimately affect the nation as a whole, but they also address the specific needs of African-Americans. President Obama has plainly said that whatever hits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unemployed Black youth is daunting, but the President knows that education can help tackle the problem. He 's the only candidate discussing the need to prepare our youth for the jobs of tomorrow. It 's not just about making sure that our businesses are kept here in the U.S. but also that our children are equipped to run these businesses, ensuring an employment that is far-reaching and generational. # But he can only do these things if we give him the opportunity again. In a recent video that caused a lot of controversy, I spoke about the importance of a second term, stating that if he 's reelected " it 's on. " My comment did n't suggest some secret liberal plan or agenda. It 's common knowledge that a political leader 's second presidential term is when he truly gets to establish his administration. At that point it 's usually about leaving a legacy. # I 've never been persecuted for my political views. It 's never affected my ability to land work in Hollywood, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still speak up. We must all voice our opinionsour words may inspire others to think differently. We have the power to change, especially as Black women, because we are leaders in our communities, in our homes and among our friends. We must use our voices. There 's just too much at stake not to. # STUMPING FOR OBAMA # Here are several celebs who proudly and publicly display their political allegiance to the President # NIA LONG visited Miss Tootsie 's restaurant in Philadelphia to rally volunteers and motivate supporters on the National Day of Action on behalf of the Obama for America campaign. She says she supports the President, particularly because of his work on women 's rights, education and health care. # ANGELA BASSETT spoke to more that 250 women this summer on behalf of the Sandhills Women for Obama chapter( the largest in the country) in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Oscar-nominated actress stressed the need to reelect President Obama as she thinks about the future for her 6-year-old twins. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard Law School more than 20 years ago. The actor has shown his support by leading community forums at various Obama campaign offices. He was also just named as a member of the President 's Cancer Panel. # MORGAN FREEMAN donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action, a Super PAC with the power to raise unlimited funds to support( or oppose) a candidate. The Academy Award winner issued this statement : " President Obama has done a remarkable job in terrible circumstances. I, for one, am proud to lend my voice and support to those who defend him.
