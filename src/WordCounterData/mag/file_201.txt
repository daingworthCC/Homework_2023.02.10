2023941 Plant breeding is too much fun to be left to the professionals <p> EVERY GARDENER should be a plant breeder. Developing new vegetables does n't require a specialized education, or a lot of land, or even a lot of time. It can be done on any scale. It 's enjoyable. It 's rewarding. You can get useful new cultivars much faster than you might suppose. And you can eat your mistakes. <p> There has never been a better time to get involved in amateur vegetable breeding. The seed-savers exchanges that have emerged during the last decade provide a rich source of raw materials for plant breeding. The smaller seed companies, many also founded recently, are eager to help perpetuate and distribute the creations of amateurs. And the professional plant breeders are all busy elsewhere. They are engaged, almost exclusively, in developing vegetables for commercial growers -- vegetables bred for uniformity and one-time picking so they can be harvested by machine, for tough skin and hard flesh so they are n't ruined by the machines, and for good storage and shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not necessarily the qualities home gardeners need ; yet most of the new vegetables released annually with such fanfare are commercial cultivars. <p> Gardeners buy only small amounts of seed compared to commercial growers, so seed of cultivars that are best suited for gardeners is sold only in small amounts. Large seed companies often ca n't afford to carry it. No one can make a profit developing it, so no one is. If we gardeners want good new garden cultivars, we 'll have to breed them ourselves. But this is as it should be. Gardeners have been developing their own cultivars for centuries. Besides, why should we let the professionals have all the fun? <p> This story is about how to breed your own vegetable cultivars and about three amateur breeders who have done it. None of them had any special education in genetics or plant breeding, yet each has produced good new garden cultivars -- cultivars that have been tested by a seed company, introduced or scheduled for introduction, and found worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best developed by anybody anywhere. <p> GLENN DROWNS was only 16 years old when he started breeding plants, but he was al ready an experienced and enthusiastic gardener. It started when he was two and a half and his family planted some flower seeds. He was fascinated. By the age of four he was crawling through the fence to help his neighbor, who had a bigger garden. At eight he had a 500-square-foot garden of his own and was ordering his own seeds. By the age of 11 he was selling all the produce his family did n't need and using the money to buy seeds ; by age 16 he was growing 50 cultivars of squash and 10 of cucumbers. He also tried about half a dozen of the shortest-season watermelons he could find. <p> More than anything else, Glenn wanted a ripe watermelon. His family lived in the extreme northern part of Idaho, where the growing season is short, cold, and unpredictable, and his melons would n't ripen. " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them inside little plastic tents all summer, just baked them. But I never got a ripe melon. The only fully ripe, melons I had ever tasted came from the store -- which did n't count. " <p> Then he took high-school biology, and his class discussed crop improvement and hybridization. " Wow, maybe I could get a ripe melon that way, " he thought. So he tried a cross. One of the parents was probably Sugar Baby '. The other was from a package of seeds some friends had given him labeled " watermelon. " Glenn did n't keep much in the way of records ; he thought he was just playing around. <p> Within four years, growing no more than a dozen plants per year, Glenn Drowns had developed a new stable cultivar -- one that reliably produces similar plants from seed to seed and year to year. Blacktail Mountain ' will be introduced by Seeds Blum, located in Boise, Idaho, in 1991. It 's a deep-green, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form a plant about 10 feet in diameter. The average melon is eight inches across, weighs eight to 10 pounds, and has a rind about half an inch thick. The flesh is orangish red, crisp, and sweet. The melons also have unexpected storage characteristics. If picked when not quite ripe and put in a cool place, they will keep six weeks and still taste as if they were just harvested. But what is essential about Blacktail Mountain ' is that it 's early -- as early as 65 days in the hot summers of Iowa, where Glenn now lives. " It 's the earliest I 've ever grown, " he says, and at this point he 's grown about 120 cultivars. <p> Glenn, now 27 and a high-school science teacher with a degree in biology, laughs when he describes the breeding program that led to Blacktail Mountain '. He did n't know there were books like Breeding Vegetable Crops and Hybridization of Crop Plants see " Further Reading, " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out anything about how to do crosses. " So I just sort of guessed, " he says. <p> Watermelons, like most cucurbits, have separate male and female flowers. Glenn noticed that some flowers had what looked like little fruits underneath and others did n't. He figured the flower buds with the fat bases must be females, the ones with skinny bases, males. He made his first cross exactly the way he does watermelon and squash crosses today, 11 years and thousands of hand-pollinations later. lie tapes the female flower bud shut with masking tape the evening before the bud opens for the first time. The timing is part convenience and part necessity. Late afternoon of the day before opening is also OK, but any earlier and the bud might still be growing fast enough to damage itself on the tape. The following day, Glenn plucks a freshly opened male flower from the appropriate plant, untapes the female flower, sprinkles pollen onto its stigma( at the top of the pistil) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. He does n't ever untape it ; it just shrivels at the end of the developing fruit. <p> Glenn crossed the putative Sugar Baby ' with the unknown watermelon, then saved the seeds and planted them. The plants, he recalls, were similar to the Blacktail Mountain ' of today. He self-pollinated each. " That was 1978, " Glenn remembers, " a gruesome year. " It was unusually cool, and his garden suffered deer damage. Only a few plants survived ; he got just one ripe watermelon. <p> He planted the seeds from that melon in 1979. The plants looked pretty much the same. He self-pollinated each and got two or three ripe melons. He planted the seeds from those in 1980, but the vines were all frozen out on the fourth of August. Fortunately, Glenn had known better than to plant all his seed in one year. He replanted in 1981 and continued to inbreed-that is, to self-pollinate each plant. By about 1982 he was offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already stable and was basically the same cultivar it is today. He grew it for a number of years more, however, before he felt confident enough in its stability to offer it to a seed company. <p> The development of Blacktail Mountain ' was unusually easy. The plants of the first generation after Glenn 's cross already had the characteristics he was looking for, and there was little variation thereafter. It 's more common for the desired type to show up in a later generation. Glenn 's development of Mexigold ' squash is more typical. He started by crossing Mexican Banana ', a blue-green banana squash, with the orange, heart-shaped Golden Delicious '. <p> Glenn usually grows just a few plants of the first generation after a cross because the plants tend to be similar. He plants as many of the second generation as he has room for, often 50 or more. Each second-generation plant is different from the others, each showing a different Combination of the characteristics of the original parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of all hues, pinkish and bluish and orangish. He selected for pink hearts, each year self-pollinating the plants that produced pink hearts and eliminating the rest. After a number of years, all the plants produced pink, heart-shaped squash that weighed 10 to 12 pounds. Glenn had stabilized the strain -- had developed a new pure-breeding cultivar. <p> Part of the fun of breeding your own cultivars is the surprises. Glenn had selected for shape, color, and productivity, but Mexigold ' turned out to be early as well -- earlier than Buttercup ', one of the earliest of squashes. Seeds Blum plans to introduce Mexigold ' in 1991, <p> EWALD ELIASON, age 73, is a retired Minnesota dairy farmer. He started breeding his own potatoes 17 years ago. " I 've always enjoyed gardening, " he says, " and potatoes are my favorite. " He started by saving true seed from the potato plants in his garden.( The tuber pieces used as starts are called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when they mean the product of sexual reproduction.) Fertilized potato flowers form berries that resemble small green tomatoes. Each contains about 200 seeds. Ewald picks the ripe berries, puts them in a blender with water and blends briefly. The seeds sink, the pulp floats. He plants the seeds in pots in a cold frame, then transplants the seedlings to his garden. <p> As Ewald 's potato hobby grew, he accumulated more and more cultivars. When the Seed Savers Exchange started, he joined and obtained cultivars-including many heirlooms -- from fellow members.( An heirloom cultivar is one that has been handed down from generation to generation.) He received potatoes from friends. He visited Minnesota 's North Shore Experiment Station one summer and obtained experimental material. His sister went to Finland and brought him back some true seed from European potatoes. And he started doing his own crosses. <p> Potatoes, unlike watermelons, have perfect flowers -- they contain both stamens( male) and pistils( female) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato flowers, but they self-pollinate to a significant extent. So when professional potato breeders do crosses, they remove the stamens before pollen is shed, a process called emasculation. Then they apply the pollen of the desired male parent to the stigma of the emasculated female parent. <p> Ewald, however, does n't bother emasculating. He just takes a flower from the cultivar he wants as male parent and dusts its pollen onto the stigma of the flower of the other cultivar. Sometimes the offspring will be from his cross, sometimes they wo n't. " I just dust the pollen on there and take what I get, " Ewald says. " Most of life is like that, I 've found. " <p> Just sprinkling pollen on there and taking what you get is a perfectly valid breeding method. When professionals do it, they call it a " fertile X fertile cross, " which sounds much less cavalier. All it means is that the breeder thought the task of emasculating was not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers are so tiny that emasculating is difficult or even impossible. For practical breeding work, it 's usually not necessary that all the offspring of an attempted cross really be hybrid, as long as enough of them are. <p> Potatoes are much easier to work with than squash or watermelons. For either of those, Glenn Drowns has to control pollination in order to develop or maintain a cultivar. Otherwise, bees would cross all his cultivars at random, and the seed would not breed true. Maintaining a dozen melon or squash cultivars entails hand-pollinating each cultivar each year. But since potatoes are propagated from tubers, not seed, all Ewald has to do to maintain a cultivar is plant its tubers. The resulting plants are genetically identical to the mother plant, whether insects cross-pollinate the flowers or not. <p> Ewald plants 50 to 100 seeds from each cross he does. Virtually all the plants give him hills of usable potatoes. During the growing season he evaluates the plants -- how vigorous they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he digs the potatoes and inspects them. He looks for potatoes that " grow clean " -- scab-free and blight-resistant. He makes notes about the yield, and during the winter he evaluates the potatoes for keeping and eating quality. <p> Ewald 's favorite cultivar -- " so far, " he says emphatically -- is Mesabi Gold ', which Seeds Blum plans to introduce when enough seed tubers are available. It 's a result of a cross of Minnesota #30 ' and Swedish Mandell ', a yellow fingerling type( much longer than it is, wide). Mesabi Gold ' has yellow skin,, yellow flesh, and good keeping and eating quality, Ewald says. Yield is good, too-about seven or eight full-size tubers per hill. The Plant itself is distinctive. Unlike most potatoes, it has upright stems about 30 inches high, though both parents had the standard bush form. " This is like a throwback to a tomato, " Ewald jokes. " It 's more a starch-type tomato. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is a favorite of Jan Blum, co-owner of Seeds Blum. " It 's a beautiful potato, " she says. " It has red skin and pink flesh and is a very nice producer. And it has lots of big flowers and looks just wonderful in the garden. " She introduced the cultivar in 1989. <p> Blossom ' came from a berry off a plant of Poorlander ', an heirloom variety. Blossom ' has good keeping and eating quality, says Ewald, and is a good yielder of potatoes " of more than ordinary size. " But unlike most potato plants, which flower only on the ends of their stems, Blossom ' also tends to flower at the nodes. Ewald thinks it could be used to breed an ornamental potato. " I 'm thinking it has the potential of being developed into a plant you could grow in your flower garden, " he says, " and at the same time, yoga could enjoy the potatoes. " <p> Ewald Eliason is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various plants and dig them up, every one is a surprise, " he says. " They 're like children in a family. You just do n't know what you 're going to get. " <p> TIM PETERS, like Glenn Drowns, became a plant breeder in high school. Glenn, however, had the good fortune to start with a vegetable that is easy to work with. Tim began with broccoli, a plant breeder 's nightmare. And while Glenn seems to have been born a gardener, Tim had it thrust upon him. <p> At the age of 15, Tim was not particularly interested in gardening or in plants. He liked animals, and was learning how to breed fish. His father, though, was an avid gardener. Then the family moved from California to Myrtle Creek, Oregon, a small town in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The soil was poor. The insects were terrible. There was no rain. After a couple of years, Tim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's your job. " <p> Tim was not pleased. He wanted to spend his time with his fish. Instead he hauled manure, weeded, and watered things by hand. " Boy, I hated that, " he recalls. " But after a while I decided that, since I was going to be stuck there in the garden all summer, I 'd better learn to like it. And after a while I did start liking it some. " <p> The following year Tim made his first cross, a self-pollination of Green Comet ' broccoli. It was a disaster. He saved the seeds and planted them, but the plants hardly grew at all. Broccoli, like many of the brassicas, has a genetic incompatibility mechanism, a physiological mechanism that prevents self-pollination. The plants have perfect flowers and are anatomically capable of pollinating themselves. But the pollen does n't usually fertilize well. In some cases, it wo n't germinate at all. In others, it germinates but grows so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when self-pollen grows and achieves fertilization, seed may not develop or, if it develops, may produce only weak, sickly seedlings. <p> Tim did n't give up. He had read in a magazine that the Japanese practiced bud pollination of brassicas. He did n't know what bud pollination was, but it sounded like a good idea. So he started pollinating buds -- and it worked. Later he found out that the incompatibility characteristic of the stigma develops fairly late in brassica flower formation, so that by pollinating in the bud stage he was bypassing the incompatibility mechanism entirely. <p> Later in his breeding project, Tim needed to isolate broccoli plants to prevent cross-pollination. A professional would have had isolation farms, where each cultivar grew far from any other. Tim developed his own approach. He put the plants in pots and loaded them onto his bicycle. Then he rode around looking for isolated homes. When he found one, he knocked on the door with a potted broccoli in his hands, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could help him out. Usually they did. Tim 's early work with broccoli did n't lead to any new introductions, but he learned a lot about breeding plants. <p> After he graduated from high school, he got a plea for help from a friend in Africa, and off he went. He spent several years setting up a farm for a mission school and breeding tropical corn. He returned in 1980, during a mini depression in Oregon. There were no jobs. There was also no money for college. Tim got a part-time job doing landscaping and found a position as caretaker on a farm that gave him a trailer to live in and a four-acre field to breed vegetables in. Oregon State University, just a few hours north, had a fine agricultural library. " I 'm going to learn everything I can from this field and that library, " Tim resolved. And he did. <p> Tim now works with broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, corn, melons, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released commercially -- a broccoli, of course -- was introduced by Territorial Seed Company, located in Lorane, Oregon. Umpqua ', named after a river in southwestern Oregon, is a very early, deep-green broccoli with especially large central heads. " In our trials, " declares the Territorial catalog, " Umpqua ' has outperformed all other open-pollinated nonhybrid varieties that we know of. " It 's also earlier than all other open-pollinated cultivars and as early as the earliest hybrids.( An open-pollinated cultivar will come true from seed ; a hybrid -- the offspring of a cross between two true-breeding cultivars -- will not.) <p> It took more than just inbreeding from a single cross, however, to produce Umpqua '. Like most plants with incompatibility mechanisms, broccoli exhibits strong inbreeding depression. This means that the more genetically uniform the plants, the smaller and weaker they tend to be and the lower their yield. Inbreeding, which is done in order to increase genetic uniformity, can thus be counterproductive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to achieve uniformity for the important agricultural characteristics while maintaining enough genetic heterogeneity to produce vigorous plants. <p> Tim started by crossing several hybrids with each other. Then he inbred the progeny from each cross to develop lines and selected the type he wanted -- very early broccoli with medium height, big central heads, and good yield -- within each line. Then he pooled all the lines and allowed them to cross-pollinate -- a mess, but a practical approach to dealing with the plant that had become his special priority. For several generations thereafter he selected for the type he wanted until his new open-pollinated cultivar became stable. <p> Tomatoes are one of Tim 's other favorites. They are easy to work with. Because tomatoes are almost totally self-pollinating, you do n't have to hand-pollinate to maintain a number of different cultivars or to inbreed from selected individuals. The plants inbreed themselves. They do n't usually show inbreeding depression either. It 's fairly easy to produce good inbred cultivars that perform as well or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of what he calls dehybridizing the hybrids. " The professional breeders have put lots of good things into those modern hybrids, " Tim says. " I like those good things. " So he tries to get them from the hybrids into open-pollinated cultivars. He might cross a very disease-resistant hybrid, for example, with an heirloom that has spectacular flavor, then inbreed and try to select a line that has the best characteristics of both parents. <p> Tim often starts just by saving seeds from a good hybrid. The seed company has already done the original cross between two different cultivars. Seed companies usually keep the identity of the parents secret so that no one else can produce the hybrid seeds. Customers often believe that they ca n't save hybrid seed, that it 's no good. But you can save the seed from most hybrid vegetables. <p> The seeds from Tim 's hybrid broccoli failed, not only because the parent was hybrid, but also because of their genetic incompatibility mechanism. The hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The incompatibility mechanism prevented the plants from being self-fertile. Tomatoes, corn, squash, melons, cucumbers, and many other vegetables do n't have incompatibility mechanisms. Seed from their hybrids is good ; it just does n't breed true. A row or field of plants that are all individuals could be a disaster for a commercial grower, but for the gardener it can represent opportunity. <p> For example, Tim has done a fair amount of work with the Early Girl Hybrid ' tomato, which does well in the Pacific Northwest. It 's very early, it 's crack-resistant, it 's resistant to verticillium wilt, and it has good flavor. But the fruits are n't very big. So Tim saved and planted the seeds from an Early Girl ' fruit. All the resulting plants were pretty early, and all the tomatoes tasted good. But there was a tremendous range in fruit size, from almost cherry types to great big ones. He saved seeds from the plants with big tomatoes and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but are open-pollinated and bear big beefsteak-type tomatoes as well. <p> Tim Peters had been an amateur vegetable breeder for more than a decade when he read that Territorial Seed Company was looking for a vegetable breeder. He could not imagine anything more wonderful than being paid to breed vegetables. But he had only a high-school diploma. Nevertheless, he screwed up his courage and went to talk with the people at Territorial -- and ended up losing his amateur status. He now handles the seed company 's trial and breeding program. <p> GLENN DROWNS, Ewald Eliason, and Tim Peters all developed useful new vegetable cultivars -- ones that met their requirements better than anything else available. You can do it too. But where should you start? What kinds of things are worth doing? Are you likely to make any money at it? Should you patent your plant? And how do you get a new cultivar out where others can use it? <p> Many amateur breeders start by accident. They simply notice something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start deliberately, choose a vegetable you like to eat ; you could be eating lots of it before you 're done. The amateurs profiled in this article suggest you limit yourself to one or two projects, although none of them did. You probably wo n't either, which is just as well. Not all projects work out. <p> Breeding new vegetables is a matter of love, not money. The U.S. Plant Variety Protection Act( 1970) is n't of much relevance to those who develop or sell garden vegetables. Licensing a cultivar is too expensive -- $2,000 for 18 years. Few garden cultivars would ever sell well enough to cover that, so even those developed by seed companies are usually unprotected. Breeding them is not profitable -- which is one of the reasons that amateur efforts are so necessary. <p> While the Plant Variety Protection Act is of little benefit to amateur breeders, it 's of little hindrance either. You can grow your own seed from protected cultivars as long as you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivars in developing your own. You are not allowed to use a protected cultivar to make hybrids to sell commercially, nor may you merely select from a protected cultivar without doing any crosses. But you can cross a protected cultivar with something else and work with the progeny to develop your own cultivar. And you can use hybrids in any way you want. They are protected by secrecy, not by law. <p> Stokes Seeds, Inc., in Buffalo, New York, is a company that would like to see more from amateurs, says president John Gale. He has two suggestions, based on his own experience with amateurs. First, he says, an unstable cross straight out of the garden is n't useful. You have to grow a new cultivar for several years and cull out the off-types each generation. Only after the cultivar is yielding all desired-type plants is it ready to offer to a seed company. <p> Second, find out what is already available. There are tomatoes of most every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, green, brown, purple, bronze, white. They are n't popular, but they 're certainly not new. <p> Rose Marie Nichols McGee, of Nichols Garden Nursery, in Albany, Oregon, concurs and mentions that she is especially unenthusiastic about the idea of a " new " white carrot. " Carrots started white, " she points out. " Breeders worked for a long time to get the beautiful orange color. Wild carrots are white, and any accidental cross with them gives you a white, so they turn up all the time. And anyway, we already carry white carrots. " <p> But there are lots of things Rose Marie does want. There has never been much breeding work with herbs, she says. Almost anything that 's different is interesting. Foliage differences ; variegation ; color differences in plants, flowers, or stems ; differences in size, growing habit, or form ; differences in flowering characteristics or patterns ; differences in odor -- all are worth paying attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With vegetables Rose Marie is interested in early maturity, compactness, and disease resistance. If, for example, you have an eggplant that is doing nicely when all the rest are dying from verticillium wilt, you might have something. " The sophisticated amateur is well-positioned to notice these things, " she says. " You may not know what the disease is, but you can see that one plant is behaving differently. "( A cooperative-extension agent can help you identify the disease.) <p> " And with vegetables, " Rose Marie says, " we look for quality, and also beauty. Many people are gardening on small plots, and the attractiveness of vegetables as plants is an increasingly important part of the pleasure. <p> " Genetic accidents occur all the rime, " she says. " But what is important is n't just the plant. It 's whether there is someone around to notice -- a person with a keen eye, with the ability to recognize what 's special. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is simply no professional breeding work. " Unless amateurs do it, " she says, " it 's not going to be done. " She wants to know if anyone is interested in breeding Jerusalem artichokes( Helianthus tuberosa), for example, or groundnuts( Apios americana), or camases( Camassia species). " There are lots of varieties of camases, " says Jan, " and the plants are beautiful, but few people have played around with them. " <p> Amateurs can afford to gamble. They need not justify their efforts to superiors or grant agencies. Jerusalem artichokes, groundnuts, and camases are n't major vegetables now, but perhaps they could be if someone did the breeding work. <p> With common vegetables, what Jan cares about above all is flavor. She also loves vegetables that are grown for particular dishes. " If you cherish a tomato because it makes the very best lasagna, or whatever, that matters, " she says. <p> Jan also has suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizes that good things frequently come from accidents -- the spontaneous mutation, the accidental cross. " So many people will tell you about some wonderful thing that showed up in the garden one year. But they did n't save the seed from it. Sometimes I really ache when I hear about these things. You just know you 're not going to see that again. " Make records of anything unusual in your garden, Jan says. Save those seeds and grow some of them out next year. <p> Jan emphasizes that selection alone is a valid breeding method. People do crosses in order to achieve the genetic heterogeneity from which to select new types. But heirloom cultivars often contain a lot of genetic heterogeneity already. You can often guide them toward your own breeding goal by consistently culling out the plants you do n't like each generation and saving seed from the ones you do like. " Everyone who saves seed is a plant breeder, " Jan says. " They choose which genetic material to perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 'll want to get it out where others can find it. The simplest way is probably to offer it through a regional or national seed-savers exchange. The Heirloom Gardener, by Carolyn Jabs, lists regional and crop-specific exchanges. See " Further Reading, " on page 48. Abundant Life Seed Foundation, in Port Townsend, Washington, for example, is both a seed company and a nonprofit foundation dedicated to preserving the germplasm of the Pacific Northwest. It handles native, naturalized, and open-pollinated cultivars. Forest Shomer, the director, says the foundation would like to carry amateur-bred cultivars that do well in the Northwest. <p> The Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah, Iowa, preserves and distributes open-pollinated cultivars that are not available commercially. It is fertile ground for amateur vegetable breeders, and a marvelous source of breeding material, contacts, and information. The Exchange 's Garden Seed Inventory and Winter Yearbook describe all cultivars available commercially or through members. You can see what has been accomplished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the cultivar you 're thinking of. In addition, members often list their projects and interests, exchange information, and test each other 's cultivars. <p> You may want to offer your new cultivar directly to a seed company. Many of the smaller or family-owned seed companies are happy to introduce vegetables bred by amateurs. Choose just one seed company to approach, however. Testing and introducing a new cultivar is work, and the introducing company has no legal protection. If a new introduction is successful, many companies will offer it. The introducing company receives no reward for its work other than the satisfaction of being first to offer something special. <p> By the time you 've developed a good new cultivar, you 'll often know which seed company to offer it to. Look first to the companies you buy seed from. If you like what they 're doing, they might like what you 've done too. Territorial Seed Company was the logical choice for Tim Peters 's new broccoli. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the maritime Northwest, and has introduced many new brassica cultivars. Glenn Drowns and Ewald Eliason both met Jan Blum, of Seeds Blum, through the Seed Savers Exchange. Her company specializes in open-pollinated and heirloom cultivars. Many of the newer or smaller seed companies were founded specifically to serve home gardeners. Among them any good new garden cultivar is likely to find a home. <p> A CENTURY AGO, seed catalogs were full of new introductions bred by amateurs. Today such contributions are rare. Yet there are not very many professional vegetable breeders, and their work is focused on just a few of the most economically important vegetables. Fortunately, some commercial cultivars are good garden cultivars as well. Also, many professionals deliberately spin off garden cultivars from their commercial breeding programs. And sometimes they spend part of their time working on cultivars just for us, whether it is economically justifiable or not. Most are gardeners themselves, or at least started out that way. <p> Before about 1900, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant breeding in the sense we 'd use the phrase today. During the first half of the century, as the basics of genetics came to be understood, commercial vegetable production was still largely a scaled-up version of garden production, and most vegetables were sold near the farms where they were grown. Commercial cultivars were often similar or identical to home garden ones. This Was a golden age for development of garden cultivars. Professional breeders, with their new-found knowledge of genetics, created much of the best we gardeners have today. By 1950, however, most commercial vegetable production had become machine-oriented. The needs of commercial growers and home gardeners diverged. Since then, the contributions of professional breeders to gardening have dwindled. <p> Unfortunately, amateur vegetable breeding has also dwindled. It became almost a lost art during the decades when the professionals were so active. Now the professionals have largely left the field, and there is a vacuum. It 's time for amateurs to move back in and fill the gap. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your garden and make a cross. You do n't have to know what you 're doing. You do n't have to do it right. You do n't have to read a bunch of things first. You might do everything wrong and end up with something wonderful anyway. The important thing is to start. <p> Breeding plants is something every gardener did once. It 's something every gardener should do again. Developing your own vegetables can add a new dimension to your experience as a gardener and to your satisfaction. <p> For the addresses of seed companies and seed-savers exchanges mentioned in this article, see page 59. <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : Left : Flanked by shelves of neatly labeled jars at the Seed Savers Exchange, in Decorah, Iowa, squash breeder Glenn Drowns removes seeds from a Queensland Blue '.

Yet there is a wealth of information available, and much of what has been written for professional breeders is usable by amateurs. The trick is simply not to let yourself be intimidated.

The first four books are intended for the layperson. The next three are specialized books for professional breeders or their technicians, who often have no background in the subject. The last three are theoretical books on plant breeding and plant genetics. Happy reading! <p> The Garden Seed Inventory, 2nd edition, by Kent Whealy( Seed Savers Exchange, 1988). A compilation of names, descriptions, and sources for all nonhybrid vegetable cultivars available commercially in the United States and Canada( more than 5,000). As much fun as 215 seed catalogs, which is what it represents. <p> 1990 Winter Yearbook, by Kent Whealy( Seed Savers Exchange, 1990). A list of cultivar descriptions ; gives access to thousands of cultivars maintained by members but not available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seed Savers Exchange. <p> Seed Savers Exchange : The First Ten Years, edited by Kent Whealy and Arllys Adelmann( Seed Savers Exchange, 1986). A compendium of the best articles published by the Seed Savers Exchange in its 10-year history. Includes the Seed Saving Guide, which is as good as any whole book published on the subject. <p> The Heirloom Gardener, by Carolyn Jabs( Sierra Club Books, 1984). An introduction to finding and growing heirloom cultivars and saving seed. Includes an appendix giving the addresses of the various seed-savers exchanges. <p> Hybridization of Crop Plants, edited by Walter R. Fehr and Henry H. Hadley( American Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of America, 1980). Instruction on exactly how to make crosses. Many pictures and diagrams. No background in genetics or plant breeding is required. Crops covered are bean, broadbean, chickpea, corn, cowpea, crambe, lentil, pea, peanut, potato, rapeseed and mustard, soybean, sugarbeet, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forage crops. Does n't cover genetics or general plant breeding. <p> Breeding Vegetable Crops, edited by Mark J. Bassett( AVI Publishing, 1986). Fourteen chapters covering 14 vegetables : asparagus, bean, cabbage, carrot, corn( sweet), cucumber, lettuce, onion, pea, pepper, squash, sweet potato, tomato, and watermelon. Each chapter includes sections on the general botany of the vegetable floral botany and controlled pollination( doing or avoiding crosses), major breeding achievements of the past, an overview of current breeding goals, genetics, gene lists, and an extensive bibliography of the current professional literature. If your vegetable love is one of the 14, this book is a must. It assumes an extensive background in genetics and plant breeding, but much of the book is useful for novices too. <p> Vegetable Seed Production, by Raymond A. T. George( John Wiley and Sons, 1986). For the professional seed producer. However, researchers frequently need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives small-scale as well as large-scale methods. Covers virtually all major and most minor crops. Includes information on pollination mechanisms and isolation requirements of the plants and on harvesting, threshing, and storing of the seed. <p> Plant Breeding and Genetics in Horticulture, by C. North( Macmillan, 1979). An introduction to genetics for beginning horticulture students and interested others. A good place to start if you 'd like to learn some of the genetics behind plant breeding. <p> Flower and Vegetable Plant Breeding, by Leslie Watts( Grower Books, 1980). A more extensive introduction than North 's to the genetics behind plant breeding. For beginning horticulture students and " enthusiastic amateur gardeners. " Besides general plant genetics, it includes a page or two of specific information on most of the major vegetable groups. It has a short glossary. <p> Fundamentals of Plant Genetics and Breeding, by James R. Welsh( Kreiger Publishing, 1981). For beginning plant-breeding students. More comprehensive coverage of both basic genetics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no coverage of specific vegetables. It has a glossary. <p> By Carol Deppe <p> HOW MUCH SPACE DO YOU NEED? <p> You can conduct an elaborate vegetable breeding project with ridiculously little land. For example, Tim Peters recommends the following procedure for tomatoes : Plant about 50 seeds of your first generation in a half-gallon pot of soil. When they come up, select for early emergence and seedling vigor, and eliminate all but about 10. As the plants grow, remove all suckers and branches, and limit each plant to just one vine. In addition, you may need to leaf-prune -- that is, remove all the older, bigger leaves to keep the plants from shading each other out. When the plants start flowering and have set a few fruits, remove the tops. Then continue to remove all suckers and branches. And pay careful attention to soil fertility. Use good soil initially and fertilize as necessary. <p> The plants will be stunted compared with field-grown ones, flowering will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will ripen. You can determine fruit colors and shapes. You can tell whether the plants are determinate( shorter, bush types) or indeterminate( continual-bearing vine types). You can tell earliness relative to other plants similarly grown. And you can select for disease resistance. For the latter, just shred some infected plant material on top of the soil in the pot. <p> During the second year of your breeding project, plant 50 seeds from each of your original 10 plants in separate half-gallon pots. You thin, grow, prune, and evaluate as before. This time, save seeds from just one plant per pot, because you 're going to use only 10 pots per year. In subsequent years, you always choose just one plant per pot from which to continue inbreeding. In this way, you can inbreed 10 different lines out of a cross with just five gallons of soil. <p> You can use this method with peppers also, Tim says, and with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or with vine crops. For melons, squash, and cucumbers, plant the seeds in a bed, just six inches apart in all directions. Then proceed as for tomatoes. You 'll be able to select for fruit color and shape, earliness, disease resistance, and many other characteristics -- but not, of course, for fruit size or yield. <p> By Carol Deppe <p>
