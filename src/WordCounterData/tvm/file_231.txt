5264341 You 're seeing the Senator in an hour. Get going, or you 'll hit traffic. I 'm on my way. Eyes straight ahead, Jack. Let the cops go. It 's a green light, Jack. Make a right. I left something for you under your visor. What do you want me to do with this? I 'll tell you when you get to your office. You pull something off the keycard? I may be close to finding your assassin. Got a name? Almost. You see this? It 's a scrambled medical file referencing a series of plastic surgeries. If it 's the shooter, he 's trying to hide his identity. - Or assume someone else's. - To get close to Palmer? Mm-hmm. Call me when you get a name. Right. Pull over. Keith. I 'll flag him on the right. - Let my man get him. - No! We 're on high alert. There 's a threat on your life. - Call your man off. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, hold up. Go away. I need to talk to you. Mom already said you 're doing all the talking. I 'm gon na speak at the breakfast to tell our side of the story. " Our side "? Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out and spin it the wrong way. It wo n't matter how the story comes out. Everyone will still think I went to go kill Gibson that night. Who 's gon na believe it was an accident? I believe you, son, if you say so. Look, when your mother and I go to this breakfast in an hour we want you and Nicole to come with us. Why? So you can save your campaign by sacrificing me to CNN? So, I can stand by you, as your father. It 's a little late for that. You never gave me a chance to help you. How could I? I mean, you were n't there. You can tell yourself whatever you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect me to stand up in front of everyone now and act like we 're this family... We are a family, Keith. Keith! You missed a spot. Right here, on your neck. Rick, help me get out of here. How? This place is like a prison. People break out of prison all the time. Look Gaines said he 'd let me go after I buried Dan. Now, once I 'm out of here, I 'll call your dad, tell him where you are. Great plan, except you 're not gon na get out. Gaines wo n't let you go. He 's got no reason to stop me. He does n't need me anymore. Exactly. What do you want me to do here? Replace the keycard we gave you with the one your people are trying to decrypt. Because we 're getting too close? Just do it, Jack. Remember, Jack, I can hear everything. I 've been trying you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - My cell phone battery died. What happened at the hospital? Did you find Kim? It turns out everything 's fine. She was just at a party. That 's good. - Did Teri give you my message? - No. We ID 'd the corpse you brought in. His name is Alan York. What? He 's an accountant from the Valley. We do n't know how he 's connected to any of this but we did have a breakthrough in the keycard. Give me one minute. If Alan York is dead, who is the man with my wife? He 's not an accountant from the Valley, that 's for sure. If you hurt my daughter or my wife, I will kill you, you son of a bitch. What was that? What have you done?... What have you done? Everything 's fine, Jack. But that will be the last sound your wife and daughter hear unless you get hold of yourself and you do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want. - That 's the spirit. Now the keycard, I want you to replace it with the one you took from the car. That wo n't be easy. Well, I 'm sure you 'll find a way. Not without attracting attention. That would be unacceptable. You implicate yourself you cease to be useful, and so does your family. As I said, Jack, find a way. Fine. The cellular customer you are trying to reach is currently out of range. Please leave a message at the tone. Kevin, Bauer 's wife knows you 're not Alan York. Be careful. - You okay? - I feel a little woozy. We 're almost there. Janet said the party was up this hill. I 'm sorry, but I think I 'm going to be sick. Just try to take a couple deep breaths. No, would you just pull over and stop the car? You have one new message. Kevin, Bauer 's wife knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Teri. Damn it. Oh, come on. Damn it! Dan 's buried. Oh, that 's good. You said you 'd pay me when we got back here. Yeah, I know what I said. Well, if it 's a problem, pay me whenever. Well, that 's very kind of you, Rick. But I should probably go, get out of everyone 's way. I did n't realize you were in anyone 's way. Well, I 'm not. It 's just... I did everything you wanted me to do, so there 's no reason for me to be here. I tell you what. I got a couple more things for you to do. Then we talk about when you can go. This is taking too long, Jack. I ca n't switch out the cards. It 'll attract attention. It will be bad for both of us. You 've got three minutes to make this happen. Fine, I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural when I go to the workstation. Drop the pen, and shred the paper. That 's right, Jack. I 'm watching you. Shred the note now, or your daughter dies! What happened down there? I was telling you something important and you just walk away. I 'm sorry. What did you want to tell me? I think Milo 's about to identify the shooter. That 's great. We just need a few more minutes with the card. Switch it, Jack. No more excuses. Um, look, that 's terrific... uh tell Milo to wait until I get down there. You want him to stop working on the card? Just until I get there. - Why? - Because I asked you to! Look, I 'm only gon na be a minute. All right, but hurry. He 's in Section Seven. I 'll be right down. Palmer was absent from the rally. He was represented by his children Nicole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter into this election. In other news, Governor Hodges spent the morning with heads of California 's labor unions discussing the importance of his new health care proposal. The proposal would ensure new comprehensive coverage for millions of active union members. Mom told you what 's been going on? Yeah. Is Keith going to jail? Not if it happened the way he says it did. It did. Then he 'll be fine. Is he coming to the breakfast? I hope so. Listen, I know it 's a lot to ask. Do n't worry, Dad. I 'll be there. You 're gon na get a lot of hard questions thrown at you not just about Keith. They 're gon na bring up the rape. I know. You gon na be okay? I was hoping it was over. Not talking about it all these years I started to let myself believe it never happened. You do n't have to answer anything you do n't want to. Just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. Hey, Nina says you were close to finding the shooter. - Yeah. - How much longer? Not long. I was waiting for you. Waiting for me? What do you mean? Why would you be waiting for me? - Sorry. - It 's fine, I got it. It would have been done, but Nina told me to hold off until you got here. I do n't know why said that. She must have misunderstood me. Smart boy. Great, I just wasted ten minutes. You guys get your signals straight. Milo, just get me the name. Why are you doing this? No, I already gave you that code. What 's wrong? I already computed this inverse, and now it 's not working! It might be the sectors are n't linked. Oh, you think so, huh? You 're right. Nice one. Cool. - Hey! - Bad idea. You flag down that car, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her back. If I do n't deliver you in half an hour, Kimberly 's dead. Where is she, you son of a bitch? You gon na knock me out again? Because I ca n't talk if I 'm unconscious. Where 's Kimberly? Just let me go and I 'll take you to her. You 're not going anywhere. Calling the cops would be just as bad. Or are you calling Jack? I do n't think that 's gon na help, either. Shut up. Shut up! Operations. Jack Bauer. Clearance number Q22, Q17. Patch me through to Senator Palmer 's Secret Service liaison. Hold, please. What do you want me to tell them? That you need priority clearance at the breakfast. Frank Miller. Hey, Frank, it 's Jack Bauer over at CTU. I need priority clearance for Palmer 's breakfast. - Sorry. We locked the list. - Open it up. I ca n't do that without approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Q22, Q17. All right. You 'll be checking in with Agent Pierce when you arrive. Thanks. Okay, now call Division. Post yourself out for the next hour. Tell them you 're going to the breakfast and that the investigation is making good progress. Rick. Well, you were right. Gaines is n't letting me go yet. - So, what are you gon na do? - I do n't know. Let 's get out of here, Rick. Okay, we 're here. There 's a fence here, which is over that way. They 've got people everywhere but I noticed they 're a little thin right around this area. Yo, Rick. Get off of me! What the hell are you doing? Give me five minutes, dude. No one has to know. I 'll give you four. No, do n't. I 'll be outside. When I go back out, I 'll leave the door unlocked. I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out. Go across the path behind the shed, and wait for me there. Be careful. Sorry I hit you. No, not true. Also not true. This is n't the same keycard I was working from before. What makes you say that? Because it 's giving me different data. What? I was 20 percent through this just a few minutes ago. Now it 's saying it 's 99 percent complete. Well, is n't that good? Yeah, if it were true. But I do n't believe it. This is a different key card. You 've been sitting here the entire time. Who could have switched it? I need to post out until 8:00. No, that wo n't be necessary. Yes, I 'm reachable. Thank you, bye. Nina, I ca n't talk right now. There 's an emergency down at Division. Where 's the keycard? What? Careful, Jack. Somebody replaced the keycard Walsh gave you with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack? What are you talking about? The only time Milo took his eyes off the system was when you distracted him. Okay, you 're right. I just did n't want to alarm anyone. Division got some information. They did n't trust Milo with it. Where 's the keycard, Jack? Take care of this, Jack. Give it to me, Jack, or I 'll call Division myself. Fine. Here 's the keycard. What are you doing? I 'm sorry, Nina. I 'm sorry. But believe me, I will kill you if I have to. Now, no screaming. Get her out of there now! Put this on. I do n't understand. What are you doing? Nina, do n't talk. I 'll explain everything as soon as we get out of here. Nice and quiet. Open the door. Where you guys going? Division set up a meeting between agencies before Palmer 's day starts. Nina will brief you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Jack? Where are you taking me? Just start the car and drive. - Hello? - Jack? Who? I 'm looking for my husband, Jack Bauer. It 's urgent. This phone was lying on the ground. He must have dropped it. Where are you? St. Mark 's Hospital, in the parking lot. Did you see anyone? Did anything happen there? Not that I saw. If it 's a problem, I 'll call the cops. No. No. Oh, come on. CTU. - Who is this? - It 's Jamey. Who 's this? Jamey, this is Teri Bauer. Is Jack there? - He just left with Nina. - Well, is he okay? Because he lost his cell phone. I think something happened to him. He seemed fine. Can I help you with something? Yeah, I 'm in trouble, and so is my daughter Kim. Okay, wait. Slow down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - My God. - Someone tried to take me, too. Did you call the police? No, Jack says they ca n't be involved, otherwide we 're risking Kimberly 's life. Tell me where you are so I can send someone from CTU to pick you up. I 'm on Mulholland about a mile east of Coldwater. Jamey, please tell them to hurry! Okay. We 're coming up on the hour. About the time the polls are about to open. Not that far off now. And I want to remind everybody... You look handsome. Presidential. - Where 's Keith? - He 's still in his room. We do n't have much time. David. What if Maureen Kingsley could be persuaded not to come forward with the story? I already spoke to her. There 's no way. There 's always a way. What are you getting at? Maureen is just like everybody else. She 's got a past. What if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? You mean blackmail. I do n't care what you call it. I 'm just trying to save our son and your candidacy. You 've been talking to Carl. You left me no choice. No one has to know what happened. I 'd know. We would know. After everything we 've been through tonight, how can you justify burying the truth? Because it 's been buried, David, for seven years. And digging it up again is not gon na change the fact that it already happened. You think about it. Well, ca n't say this gig does n't have its benefits. Dude, you 're lucky. If Gaines caught you with her.... bang! You 're dead. Yeah, well, Gaines did n't catch me, did he? Come on. So, how long have you been working with Gaines? I do n't know, on and off, a couple of months. Is he good for his word? What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go, if I do what he wants? Sure. I do n't know, I get the feeling he does n't like me. Here you go. Yeah, he gets uptight when he 's on a job. He 's really pretty chilly. You do the job, you 'll be okay. Cool. So, how was she? Sweet? Yeah, she was okay. She 's pretty hot. I might want to dip in myself. What about the lecture you just gave me? Are n't we supposed to be loading the trucks? All right. Let 's go. Gaines really wants to get this done. So, what are we loading? Everything. We 're cleaning the place out. Man, my keys. I 'll catch up with you. - Did anyone see you? - No, we 're cool. When we get to the fence, you 'll see a cluster of trees. That 's where we want to be. - You ready? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bauer? Yes. Hi, Teri. Charles McLemore, CTU. - You guys got here fast. - They told us it was urgent. Someone 's got my daughter. This man knows where she is. Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet? Wait, this guy is dangerous. What are you doing? No! Let 's hurry this up, boys. We 're way behind. Put her in the car. Jamey. What 's up? You got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting? I have n't checked. Why? Nina was supposed to brief me but she 's not back and she 's not on her cell. Plus, there 's nothing on my screen about it. It 's not coming up on mine either, but that does n't mean anything. Since the lockdown, the system 's been glitchy. That 's probably why the meeting 's not posting. It 's strange the way she and Jack left. Something happened in his office. What were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack 's office. Give me a ten minute loop. I 'm not authorized to do that. I 'm authorizing you. Jack and Nina are n't here. I got rank. - Yeah, but.. - Give me ten minutes starting at 6:30. Send it to my screen. - Where are we going? - Turn right. Turn right. All night you 've been telling me that somebody inside the Agency wants Palmer dead. Your daughter 's missing, and no one can be trusted, not even me. Is it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it? What was on the keycard that you did n't want us to find? Please, Nina, do n't make this harder than it is. You got a gun on me, Jack. I do n't think it gets much worse. Stay on Jefferson. In about three miles you 'll see a turn-off. Keep going straight. To think that I ever trusted you, Jack, that I defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you alive. Come on, let 's go. Stop the car. What is this place, Jack? What are we doing here? - Somebody followed us. - I know. Who are they? What do you want me to do here? What? - Take her out and shoot her. - No. - Who are you talking to, Jack? - Your choice, Jack. Nina or your daughter. Jack, I do n't understand. Why are you doing this? Get out of the car. - Get out of the car! - Jack, what..? - I 'm sorry, Nina. - What are you gon na do? You 're gon na kill me right here? I do n't have a choice. They have Kim and Teri. How do you know they wo n't kill them, even if you do this? - I ca n't take that chance with my family. - What about me? Enough chit-chat, Jack, just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it! Please, forgive me, Nina. You think I 'm messing with you, Jack? Turn around! Jack, if you 're going to do this, do it to my face! I wo n't make this easy... Get back in the car, Jack What do we do when we get there? We have to get to the road. Highway 14 is about a mile away. I know how to get there. You ready? Yeah. What 's the matter? Oh, my God! Where 's my daughter? Is she here? That 's my mom! We ca n't wait. We 've got to go. I ca n't just leave her there. Kimberly! Is my daughter here? What have you done with her? - We 've got to go now! - I ca n't. Get down, Kim. If we get out, we can help her. We can call the police. You go. Call my dad. Yeah, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of here. Let 's go. Come on. Come on. Kimberly! The polls are about to open in California which is a key state for the Palmer campaign. Earlier polls show the Senator leading by a 15 percent margin Assuming voting follows predictions, the senator... Jack, you son of a bitch. Why did he give her a flak jacket?
