Well, I 'll let you know where I 'm staying, and I 'll call you as soon as I know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug. Wait a minute. As soon as you know? I-I thought you said - - I said a few days. It all depends on how well it goes. Well, yeah. But you ca n't just disappear for God knows how long and expect me to take care of everything. I mean, Bay is, like, gone, and I 've got stuff to do -- Hey, is it too much to ask for this one thing, Jule? I mean, you might start to appreciate my life around here a little bit. Wait, Charlie, um... This is-- This is for Kirsten. It 's got some pictures of my recital. I 'll give it to her. Now, I got ta go. Have a nice trip. Well, you know what I mean. [SIGHS] THEBODEANS ' " CLOSERTOFIVE " PLAYING * Everybody wants to live * * Like they wan na live * * And everybody wants to love * * Like they wan na love * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Closer to free * I know you hate these overalls, but I 'm not the one who spilled syrup all over my pants.

No. Hurry up. So I was, um, thinking that we should maybe do something... together. Julia, do - - Do I feel warm to you? Um, not now, Claudia. Uh, sure. Absolutely. Like what? Um, do you ski? Ski? Um, me? Of course. ' Cause I was gon na go Saturday. Julia, you 're supposed to be taking care of us. In a-- A minute, Claudia. Saturday, I do n't know. I mean, Charlie... Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Jule... What? What is with you? I ca n't believe you interrupted me like that. Making me look like a stupid baby-sitter in front of Sam. I really do n't feel good. I 'm thinking maybe I should just stay home. Nice try, Claudia. You wan na skip school because Charlie 's not here. So forget it. No, really. I 'm not -- So, I 'll, uh -- I-I 'll pick you up around 8? Perfect. Julia. In the car now. Kids... OWEN : Uh-oh. My pants. Yeah. [TOILET_FLUSHING] [WHISTLE_BLOWS] Seven. Again. Good match. You work on that bridge, Andy. Hold up, Bailey. All right, men. You see this? You see this? Salinger 's been on the team three weeks, three weeks and look it him. This is what a little dedication will do for you. And do you know how many Salingers they got over at City? Every man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Bailey. All right, here 's the deal. For the next 72 hours, you drink water only, and not much of that. No alcohol. You 're gon na stick to your diets. You 're gon na work out. Let Salinger here be your example. Hit the showers. Hey. [DOORBELL_RINGING] Hello, Ellie. Charlie, you should n't have come. I called four times. I left messages. If you did n't want me to be here... Look, this - - This is not a good time. Gene 's away for a few days. I do n't know how to handle this. There 's nothing to handle. I just wan na see Kirsten. Okay? She 's not here. Where is she? Did something happen? No. No, no. She 's just gone out. Look, Charlie, I 'm sorry that you 've come all this way, but - - [HORN_HONKING] Charlie. Hey. Oh, my-- Oh, my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-- I ca n't believe this is -- This is such a surprise. I -- Mom? Did you know about this? [BIRD_CAWING] Half done. Wan na trade? Hm? Oh, sure. [CHATTER] [JAZZY_MUSIC_PLAYING] Hm, that 's kind of bland. Yeah. Part of the diet. High protein, low fat. So guess what? My parents are trying to get me ready for college, you know, so they gave me separate billing on my charge card. Cool. What 's it mean? Well, it means that they want me to start paying my own bills. So the statement comes to me now, and if I want to put something on there that I do n't want them to know about, that 'd be okay. What would you - -? Like what? Like, um, a hotel room. I-I told my mom and dad that we were going to that concert tonight, probably would n't be in till late. [SIGHS] But I-I do n't wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had talked about trying again, so. It 's like the perfect opportunity. So, do you - -? Do you want to? Try again? W-- Yeah. Of course. Of course I do. But... I ca n't. Ca n't? Why not? It 's coach. We had this totally lousy practice today, and Coach Petrocelli came down on us really hard. On me. And he said, you know, stick to the diet, no alcohol and no... you know... He j-- He just said that? Drains the stamina. Well, it-- It made sense the way he said it. Wow. Kind of sucks, huh? Owen, get away from there. You 're gon na fall. Oh. There you are. I want you to do a favor for me. No. Wait. Will you just wait a minute? I want you to watch Owen for me on Saturday. Why ca n't you do it? Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoop. Julia, my stomach is killing me. I told you. So take something, all right? Look, I know what you 're doing, Claudia, because I used to do it, and it 's not gon na work. You 're not gon na screw this up. Julia, I - - Listen, it 's bad enough that I am stuck baby-sitting you guys, I 'm not putting my whole life on hold until Charlie gets back. So you are just gon na help me, and that 's it. * You can no longer stand * * In the refractions * Hey, I 'm making soup. Well, heating soup, actually. Do you want some? No. No, I do n't. Is it too much to ask you to keep your garbage off the table? I 've got ta study. Okay. So, what 'd you guys fight about this time? What? You and Sarah. The only thing that puts you in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't fight. Okay? And I do n't wan na get into this stuff right now. Not with you. What 's that supposed to mean? Look, just - - Just please leave me alone. Great. You drank all the beer. No. You drank all the beer. Okay? And it was my six pack. Look, you know, I 'm getting a little tired of this, Bailey. Okay? Will you please -- No. You know, it just seems like every time things get a little rocky with Sarah, you-- You come home and you treat me like crap. Either that or you want me flat on my back. And you know what? I 'm kind of sick of it. What do you want from me, Callie? I do n't know, Bailey. I mean, would it kill you to at least treat me like an actual human being? I mean, is that too much to ask? You know what? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't wan na deal with any of this. That 's great, Bailey. Where do you think you 're going? Hey, I owe you a six pack. [SIRENS_WAILING] Are you sure this is okay? Better than upsetting your mom. Yeah. Guest room 's fine. These are, uh, for you. Please do n't use the ones hanging in the bathroom. Uh, there 's a plastic squeegee in the shower stall. Use it to wipe off the door if you do n't mind. It mildews. No problem. I called Gene. He 's gon na try and get back here as soon as possible. You did n't have do that, mom. Of course I did. Good night. You should get some sleep. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Ugh. She 's making me crazy. [SIGHS] So... you look great. Like you 're better. Well, the last four weeks have actually been pretty good since I went on this new medication. I mean, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So you 've been doing pretty good for -- For what, like, the last month? Well, yeah, pretty good. So, I mean, why did n't you - -? You write me and tell me or - -? Or call me or something? [CHUCKLES] I do n't know. ' Cause I 've been really worried, Kirsten. I wanted to know. It 's just... maybe I did n't really trust it, you know? Like, as soon as I wrote you or told you, it would n't be true anymore. But it is true. It is now. KIRSTEN : So, anyway, " Chic-ago " was the Indian word for stinking onion, ' cause of all the onion fields. But the French settlers pronounced it " Shi-cago. " See? And we 're walking.

I ca n't be with you. Okay. Okay. Obviously, we - - We tried to rush into this. Obviously, this was too soon to think that we could do this, but that does not mean - - Charlie, I ca n't.

And now you 're all tangled up in that somehow, and I ca n't just get past it. I -- I tried to make it go away, but it just-- It wo n't. I love you. But every time I look at you, it 's -- It 's all I see. And I know it 's not fair. And I know it 's not your fault, but it 's all I see. Darling.

' Cause it 's not like I have kids, but I sort of do. And it 's just kind of how my life is.
