5209141 Hey! Hey bud. You know I was gon na pick you up at your place. Yeah, my mom and dad are acting kind of weird right now, so I figured I 'd meet you here. Oh, okay... yeah. You okay? Yeah, everything 's fine. You sure you still want to go? Yeah. Gon na be pretty nice tonight. Maybe a little cooler. Yeah... let 's just go. Okay. It 's about ten miles up the road. You think this is far enough? Yeah. I think so. No one really comes out here. We 've never been out here before, have we? How 'd you know about this place? I used to come out here to get away from my dad. You could 've come to my house. I could n't get you in the middle of all that. You remember how mean he was. You remember when he broke my arm? Yeah, I remember. I was happy for the day he left. Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.( boyslaughing) You remember that time the scorpion bit me on the hand? That scorpion bit you so bad. It was good I was there to tell you what to do! You pissed on my hand! That 's what you 're supposed to do! It gets the venom out! Yeah, sure. Whatever.( laughing) Think everything 's okay at home? I figure it is. Told my mom I was camping with buddies. They do n't ask too many questions if I stick to the rules. I got a summer job. Yeah. It 's not that big of a deal. Working at the diner. Helping in the kitchen. Cleaning tables, you know. At least I can help my mom, now. That 's good. About the job. The extra money will help. Yeah... yeah. So I guess you 'll be leaving in a few weeks? Be kinda hard not having you around. I really do n't want to move, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoping he could 've waited until summer was over. We 've been best friends for a long time, huh? Six years. Be kind of hard getting around without you. Not gon na be easy finding a new best friend. I really wish we did n't have to move. We 'll keep in touch, right? Yeah. Be really nice. I wish I could call you sometime. If it was n't so expensive. I mean, I guess I could call you sometime. You could come visit me. I could take a couple days off work. A weekend or something. You could borrow your mom 's car and come see me! I do n't think she 'd go for that. I barely have my permit. Maybe I could. Maybe next year. I 'll try. Yeah. Yeah. I 'll try to see you, too. Sure is dark out. Yeah. Desert is the darkest place. It 's kind of scary. All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to keep an eye out for. But the fire should keep them away. You think anyone knows? I uh... I do n't think so. No one can ever find out. I mean it. If they do, my life will be over. I would never tell anyone. Yeah. I know. You want... some more chili? No thanks. I 'm fine. Well... I 'm getting kind of tired. Oh. Okay. I guess... I 'm going to head to bed. It 's getting late.( distantcoyotesounds) I want to... but I 'm so afraid. It 's okay, Kyle. People in a small town, they have a way of finding things out. You 'll be moved away, and I 'll be left here alone. People wo n't understand. You know I... I care about you a lot. I know. I 'm really gon na miss you. My best friend... is moving away... Forever. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? We were just talking about the sci-fi thing. The sci-fi thing... The movie? We 're in preproduction. The alien movie? Right. The movie.( Shocked) Holy Shit! This is one of your little aliens. Should I come back after? No. We 've got to get this done today. This needs to be approved. Tim said you wanted to see it today. Right. The little aliens. They start shooting in a week. Much better than the last one's. At least these one's are shocking... Until you realize that they 're just puppets. They have to make fifteen. Wonder how much that 's going to cost me? Tim keeps asking me if there 's an official title for the movie. He 's not sure what to tell people. He can tell them it 's untitled. How about " The Monsters That Ate Bakersfield? " Why did I agree to do this movie? You like making movies. You feel rewarded at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacation. Take some time off for yourself. For your life. Hmmm, life. Now where did I put that? They do n't tell you it 's ten percent show, and ninety percent business. Brian, save yourself. Find something you love, and do that! I think it would be cool to be the big producer man. In charge of it all. Me and a buddy are working on a short film. It 's gon na be about twenty pages. My brother has a traumatic brain injury. He was hit one night by a drunk driver. Messed up his life. Anyway, I was thinking of doing a story on that. A scripted story. Get some good actors to help out. If you want to chase your dreams, then do it. But make sure it 's what you want to do. And stay true to yourself. Do n't take any crap from anyone.( @cell_phone_rings) Hey. Definitely. He was supposed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to have the insurance on papers on file. I do n't know! Just by tomorrow! Call me back when you know for sure. I guess I have to babysit everyone!( stressattack, @heavy_breathing) You okay, Jake? Yeah... I 'm fine. Let 's get this done.( frontdooropensandcloses)( clearsthroat) Fire! You just woke up, did n't you? I guess I passed out. Dude! Deal with it! Ai n't someone little miss sassy pants. And a little bit sad. I 'm awake. Ready for a fun filled evening. I got pizza, beer, a Family Guy marathon! Come on, get up! Come on, get up. Come on! Right here! Hit it, smack it! Hit it hard! That 's good energy. I like that! Rough day, huh? The usual. It was a stress day. No kidding, man? Me too. I met the biggest freak in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. This man barges in, demanding help. Total jerk-off. Anyway, he starts on about how his account needs to be fixed. How he 's an American, and the foreigners are taking over. Dude, can you give me a break? Sorry. No problem. Thanks for the beer and pizza. Here, take it. I 'm fine. Come on, man. You like things in your mouth. Dude, eat your own pizza! Okay! You 're welcome to tell me about it when you 're ready. It 's just life, business... everything. Sounds like you 're ready for one of those padded rooms, man. I 've been having these... I do n't know.. anxiety attacks? Really? Kind of a serious issue. Might want to go to a doctor or something. For what? He 'll just tell me not to work so hard. Take some time off. Then he 'll push drugs on me. Well? Well what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell outta here. Find that life you 've been talking so much about. It 's been a long time coming. What has? I 've seen a difference in you lately. Your life... or no life. You 're depressed or something. Well maybe depressed is n't the right word. You 're definitely not happy. Well, I think I am. Oh really. You work your butt off for years. To climb that all too-tall showbiz ladder. Just to find out it 's all work and no play. You hardly ever date. You never go out, and you 're always tired. I do n't have time for anything. You work, come home, eat. And not very well. The double chins! When was the last time you had sex, for God 's sake? Can we just have our pizza and watch television? All I 'm saying, is there anything that will make you happy? Is there something you can change? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy when you 're about to have a stroke! Come here, big boy! Stop it! Why do you have to tease me! You 're straight, dude! I just ca n't resist a boy whose days are numbered. Freak! Okay, man. Let 's just figure you out. I think the last week I had off was when I graduated high school. Wow, that was what, forty years ago. That 's what I feel like. Life is just passing me by. I 'm having al these past thoughts about when I was a kid. My best friend. So you feel like you did n't find what, closure? Yeah... yeah. I think so. I knew this guy once. We were buddies in college... We were jacking around. And, uh he pinned me against the wall. And he had his hand on the button of my 501 jeans. And he just, stopped. It 's funny. I never thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my pants! Great story, dude. What 's your point? My point is, he was too afraid to take that chance. If my 501 jeans had n't been so damn tight to get into... Who knows what would 've happened. Gay! Gay! Gay!( Stevelaughs) Look, do n't overthink it. Just do it. You know what I think? Little Jakey needs a break from life. You know what that means! - No, no, no, no, no. Oh yes, it 's gon na happen! Just back off, mister! I know how to use this pizza! Okay! Okay! I 'll get a life! No more wire hangers! I promise! Stop! Stop! I know. Find out if we need a new location. And fast! Send Scott over there! See if they 'll do it with more insurance! If we do n't get that location it 's going to screw us up! Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be good. Hey John... yeah. Yeah. I did hear something about that. Uh-huh. Yes, we have two weeks left. Uh-huh. But John you have to understand... John, are you going to listen to me? John? John! Listen to me! I do n't care! You signed a contract! It was spelled out! You were going to get lead credit with Susan! And that 's what you 're getting! Alright! You know, I am sick of the whining and complaining. Am I getting paid enough? I do n't like craft services!... Do I look young enough on film? Come on! You know what? You 're either on board or not! I want you on set, on time! I do n't want you hung over from partying every night! You can do that on your own production!( doorheardopening/closing) Alright man, I 'm here. What 's the big news? Sounded urgent. Uhh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me? If you are, I get the kids. I... am... taking a trip. Getting away from it all. What, like a business trip? Personal life trip. You were right. I need a break, and if I do n't do it now... Then... I 'm gon na be trapped here, forever. You 're... really gon na do this? I 'm really doing it. Dude, look. You 're my best friend. I really appreciate... You helping me figure this out. Figure what out, man? This! Me! At least what I can do to change things. Try to find some answers. I feel like part of me is missing. Like... I 'm somewhere else. Okay, you 're not like, having a breakdown on me are you? You 're not like... going Stepford, are you? No... but... I do n't want that stroke... you know. You want to feed me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I uh... am going back to my hometown. You 're really gon na do it? Good for you, man. I think this is exactly what you need. Hey, you want to come with me? On your little journey? It 's a little short notice. Oh come on. Ca n't you get off for a few days? I do n't know. Ah, okay. So when was the last time you had a vacation? Lived a little? There was that time in Vegas but I had to pay for that. And she did n't even kiss me. So, uh... I do n't know, man. You sure you want me to come with you? Is n't this something you might want to do alone? Uh, it 's not like you 'll be in my way, dude. You can do your thing, and I can do mine. Besides, you 've always been there for me, you know. Well somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All cute and sweet! We leave tomorrow morning. Alright man. - AM. AM, right. You have to buy the coffee. That 's how it works. - Always. You 're driving, too. I 'm driving. To the airport. Wherever we 're going... Yeah, yeah! Weird trips. Packing flannel shirts...( travelmusic)( travelmusic) Ca n't believe we have to share a room, man. And you literally got like the smallest room. You can honestly touch me from where you are. Oh, knock it off. What 're we gon na do for dinner? I 'm sure this town closes at eight. You know, maybe that little diner I used to eat at... is still here. The one where Opie would go every day after school... for his rootbeer float. Shhh, hold on. I 'm looking someone up. Yeah... did you find your long lost friend? No, but I think I found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh... good. Well, maybe she has some food we can eat! You know, maybe he does n't even live here anymore. Maybe he died, man. What? What? It happens. Okay. I 'm gon na call her tomorrow. Yeah, I 'm gon na call tomorrow. Well you get on it. I 'm gon na hop in the shower. When I get out, I expect some food. Okay? I 'm kind of nervous. You know. Seeing these people after all these years. Dude... you 're such a little bitch. Man, you left like fifteen years ago. No one 's gon na recognize you now. You 're old. Thanks. Dude, I speak the truth, man. Get on it! I 'm frick'n hungry! It 's not like a prom date! Food! Food! Okay, okay. I 'm hungry. Hungry. Thank you... It was nice of you to look me up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been so long. It 's no bother. What brings you all the way out here? I just had to get away. You thought you 'd check up on the old place, huh? Maybe look up some old friends. Yes, Ma'am. Well, welcome back. It 's nice to be back. Wish I could remember back that far. I was about fifteen. I 'd probably still be living here. If my dad had n't taken a job in the city. Well, the town has n't changed that much. I bet you could find a few people you used to know. I do n't expect many of them moved away. Actually, I was wondering about Kyle. What he 's up to these days? I was n't very good about staying in touch. You sound like a man with a mission. I... when I left he was working part-time at the diner. He still cooks there in the mornings. The breakfast shift. He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and tractors. That kind of thing. Plus, he helps out at the local horse ranch. Wow, he never left town. He 's a sweety. He stops by every day or two. He brings supper. We watch Wheel of Fortune. I thought he 'd be doing something else by now... or moved away. He worked in that diner after school... and on weekends all the time growing up. He worked hard to save up for college. He was always taking about how he was going to college. He wanted more than a cowboy life. He worked all those rodeos just to get more college money. When he 'd rather be doing something else. I expect with all those jobs he does, it earns him enough. There 's nothing lazy about Kyle. He 's had a pretty rough life growing up. We 've all had our tough times I expect. I 'd like to see him get out more, but... I guess that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days. Mostly pool halls and bars now. He just lives a few blocks from here. He has a small place, but he 's made it real nice. He 's usually home, or at his cousin 's place. If you see his old pickup you 'll know he 's there. I bet he 'd be real surprised to see you again... after all these years. He could use a good friend. I think he gets lonely sometimes.( @train_whistle, signal)( footstepsheard) Hello? Hello. Yeah, I 'll be right with you. Need some work done? Uh, no. I 'm a friend of Kyle 's. I 'm looking for him. Uh, Kyle 's inside ordering some parts. You 're welcome to go in and wait. Okay... thanks. Well, I 'm Kyle 's cousin, Heath. I 'm Jake. Wow! Pretty busy, huh? Yeah, yeah. Makes us a little money. Good for bars and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Yeah. How 'd you guess? I see you were smart enough to get out of this town. Oh, I do n't know. I kind of like it. People are a lot friendlier. Yeah. I reckon that 's true. No car jackings around here.( @knock_on_door)( @knock_on_door) Yeah, it 's Kyle. Just checking on that heater core I ordered. So it 'll be here by Friday? Sounds good to me. Alrighty. Uh... how you doing? Great, thanks. Sorry about the hand. You need some work done? Can probably get you in tomorrow. Well, this is gon na be a shock to you. Do n't I know you? It 's me, Kyle. Jake. Jake? My best bud! From when we were kids! Oh my gosh! You need to sit down... Wow... I was n't sure I should be here. But I wanted to see you. Sorry to give you such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a long time. Well, uh... let me give you a hug, buddy. Ca n't believe you 're standing here. Thought I 'd never see you again. Yeah, me neither. Little Jake. Standing right here. Well, what brings you back here? I wanted to see my old buddy. Just needed to get back to where I was raised. Well can I get you something to drink? No, thanks. I 'm fine. Well uh, what are you up to these days? I work in the movie business. Producing. Movies huh? Well, good for you. Never thought you 'd wind up in that business. Bet it 's a lot of fun. Oh, it 's okay. It ages you. Your aunt was telling me you 're doing well for yourself, too. You 've got the business here. Still working with the horses. Doing some cooking... Oh it 's okay. Keeps me busy. I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. Uh... you staying for a while? Yeah. A few days. Uh... you want to get together sometime? I mean, unless maybe you have other plans. I came to see you. I 'm free to do whatever you want. We 've got a lot of years to catch up on. I 'm sure sorry to hear about your mom. Oh, uh... thanks. I always liked her. Yeah. She was sick for a while. It just finally got to her. You know, I... still think about you, sometimes. I wonder what you 're up to. Hope you 're doing okay. Hell, I just thought I 'd never see you again. But... here you are. So yes. Maybe getting together. Tonight? That 'd be great. Maybe I can cook us some supper. Get me a good home-cooked meal? Sure. So... about seven sound good? Yeah, uh yes. Seven, sounds great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really good to see you again, Kyle. So uh, I 'll see you later tonight, then? Yeah. Seven. Supper. Here. Alright. I 'll have it ready. Well, I 'll be seeing you later. See you later! Alright.( @door_closes) Wow. You did all this for me. Oh, it 's nothing. I could 've picked you up at your place. I 'm just a few bocks away. I enjoyed the walk. I really appreciate you having me over for supper. I miss those days. It 's all different when we grow up. I have n't had a meal like this since I left here. It 's a regular okie supper. You 've made a real nice place here for yourself. I like it... a lot. It ai n't much, but it 's home. Do n't you eat at home?( laughs) Buddy, this is great fixins. This whole day is great. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back to Hollywood? Yeah. I guess so. Maybe I could show you around town. How things have changed. Yeah, that would be great. I see you still have the same old pickup truck. Lot of memories with that truck. Oh... around here I do n't need anything to show off with. Do n't know what I 'd get. New trucks are so expensive. Uh, anything fun go on around here. In small town America? Not much anymore. I just do my thing. I get together with the guys sometimes. We shoot some pool. Have some beers. I visit with my aunt a few times a week. I might have a friend over. Rent us a movie. Hang out with my cousin Heath, mostly. Hell... I was even gon na get married there for a while. What? You look a little surprised. Uh, no... I just... wow. You were gon na get married. Good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She went to the market one day and never came back. She did leave me a letter on my windshield though. Hell, I probably should n't even been getting married. To her, anyways. I did try to find you. So I could make you my best man. You did that for me? Sorry I was n't around. Oh hey. That 's no big thing. It is to me! We were best friends. We were gon na grow up and see the world together. I do n't know. I just got so caught up in life there... I kept saying I was going to call or write or... It was n't fair to you. You know, I had these feelings. I was a kid. Maybe, maybe I did n't know what I was supposed to do. I had these feelings about things... And I... well I just left that all back here. I think about this place. This life. Us, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Getting outta that noisy city. Sure be nice having you back here again. But I, guess that 's where you have to be. ' Cause that 's where the movies are made. Yeah... most of the time. Hey, you want another beer? Oh, I do n't know. I just had to figure things were n't gon na be different. So what about college. You never got to go? With mom getting so sick... There was just too many things that came up. I said I 'd put it off for a year to take care of her. Work all I could. Help pay the bills. After a year she just got too weak, tired of living like that. I could n't blame her for wanting to go. I know I could n't live like that myself. She really liked you, though. She talked about you all the time. She always said there was something kind about you. Anyway, I was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess. Thousands of dollars. I even had to sell the family house to pay off the bills. I rent this little place right now. Do n't know if I 'll ever get ' em paid off. I do what I can. But... my dream of college... That other life, outside this place... It just was n't gon na happen. Anyway... I do what I can. I 'm just a cowboy.( turnsengineoff) Thanks for a great time, oh and, thanks for bringing me back. You 're welcome. I could n't let you walk back in the rain. Man, I have not had that much fun since I left here. Yeah, it was kinda fun. Anyway, it was a nice thing to do. Be a lot more fun times if you could visit more. Oh yeah, I will. Or maybe I could come visit you. You in the city, Kyle? I do n't know. I... do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably not. Heck. Been here so long I would n't know what to do. So many people try to run from their small town life. You know. They think there 's always something better. You know, I was thinking about all those years back... How we were becoming more close as friends. Shoot. That was such a long time ago.( nervous) Yeah, well it 's getting late. we can talk tomorrow. Maybe you can show me around. Sure! That 'd be okay. Whatever you want to do is fine by me. Well, I guess I better get inside. I know you 've got ta get up early and all. Yeah. That 5 AM does come early. Man, all these years. Early everyday, huh? Yeah... all these years. Well thanks again, buddy. See you tomorrow? Tomorrow. Hey, Jake... Yeah... Are uh, are you... uh... uh... sleep well, bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone again. Hope you 're finding things to do. No worries, man. I 'm kind of digging this vacation thing. And this town has some history, so... Not every day I get to hang out in the country with my best friend, so it 's not bad. I 'm gon na be hanging out with Kyle some more. Oh yeah? Nice! Do n't worry man, I 've got it covered. I figure dinner and dessert... Some beers down at the local pub. You know, shoot some pool. Maybe uh... find me some cute local girls. You know how I do it. Yeah, right. Alright. Just, you know what? Be careful, alright? I do n't want you to end up in the hospital. Some of those girls... Just make sure they do n't have boyfriends. You 're so lame, you know that? I mean you 're just no fun, whatsoever. If it 'll make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some people... Come home, jerk-off on your pillow... If I meet some hot local chick... I 'll make sure she 's unattached. You happy with your life? - What? - Are you happy? The choices you 've made. The day to day routine? I think so. I mean, I 'm not sure anyone is truly happy. Yeah... I 'm content. That makes me think. What 's the meaning of life? Most people just take from the world. They never give back. In the end, you 're just left a shell of a man. I do n't want the last line of my life to be... Why do I feel like there 's something missing. I want to say I did good in life. I made a difference. Like my grandpa. He was a simple man. Raised poor, but... I used to always tease him. About driving around town with coupons, just to save a few cents. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... More stuff than we 'd need. I never understood why. One day I was riding my bike down the street... I see him walk to this house where some poor people live. He has this bag of groceries. He hands it to the wife. She starts crying, man. Yeah... I think that 's the meaning of life. It really is that simple, is n't it? Yeah. Yeah it is, man. Beautiful is n't it. Sure is. I used to get up here a lot. Get'n away from everything helps me think. I do n't get up here much anymore. I hoped to build a house here sometime. I do n't know. Maybe someday. Oh, there 's still time. Oh I guess. Maybe so. You know, I was thinking about all those years. Each of us not knowing what each other 's life was like. How we could 've helped each other out. Guess I think too much. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on taking chances. I guess we 're all a little afraid at times, I reckon. Yeah, and then when we figure it out, we 're old. I 'm gon na be a terrible old person. I 'm gon na be one of those guys... That talks about the past all the time, you know, that says... " I had to walk ten miles just to get to the train station... to ride it into town to get a sack of tater chips. Then I 'd get ' em home, and they 'd be the wrong brand. Dadgummit! " It 's nice to see you laughing. I feel like you do n't get to do it that much. It 's getting kinda late. I think it 's gon na rain. We 'd better get home. It 's gon na get dark. I know you do n't like the dark much. I still think about those coyotes. Yeah. I did n't want you to think I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's in the past. No, it was part of our life then. and I know with me get'n married and all, you must be wondering. Yeah. I kind of wonder. That 's what you were gon na ask me last night. If I was a big homo? I did n't exactly think that. We still know each other pretty well. Ahh. What do you say we go cook us an Okie supper? Sounds good to me.( rainpouring, @door_closes)( rainpouring, @door_closes) Holy cow, it 's coming down! - Yeah, man! Here you go. Thanks. These thunderstorms come up fast. I 'll get us some clothes. Now I 'm getting cold. Here you go. Thanks. This gets warm in a hurry. I do n't remember it being this cold this time of year. Did n't used to be. Last few years it 's been getting colder. Yeah. It even snowed around this time last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really surprised. You warming up? Yeah. I 'm gettin ' toasty. How 's your friend Steve get'n along? He 's welcome here. Thanks, you know, he 's... He 's sleeping in a lot. Gets out, gets dinner, checks out the town. Goes to the bars. I think he 's looking for a little lady, you know. Told him just make sure she does n't have a man already. That 's good. He 's a tough guy, but I do n't think he 'd fair too well against good ol ' boys. You were close with your mom? Oh. Yeah... We 'd spend hours together sometimes, just talking about anything. Probably nothing that mattered. but, we did have some good times. Sometimes I 'll go to pick up the phone to call her. But then I remember, I ca n't. Or I 'll be driving. I 'll drive by the house... like I 'm gon na go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Someone else living there. It 's okay to be sad sometimes, you know. Life just sucks at times. I 'm sorry that, you know... That I was n't around when your mom... It 's gon na bother me that you had to go through that alone. Nobody should be alone. Yeah. No one should be alone. It 's been a long time since that night we went camping. I was n't sure you remembered or cared to remember it, but... The day I left here, I uh... I really did leave a part of me, and uh... I do n't know if you... I ca n't know for sure how you feel or... If you feel about me, the way that I feel... The way I feel... You know what, I 'm sorry. I should go. No. Do n't go. I really do n't ever want you to leave. It 's just been so long since anyone... I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what to do here. Look Jake. I ca n't offer a person much. You deserve better. Well I...( anxious, nervous) I forgot to get this stuff to my aunt this morning. I 'll be back in a little while. I 'll make us some supper when I get back.( doorcloses/raining)( dooropens/closes) - Kyle, that you? - Yeah, it 's me. Brought your things by. Thanks sweety. I 'll put ' em away tomorrow. What 's going on around here? Just the usual. Your friend still visiting? Yep. I think he 's heading back in another day. I 'm gon na cook us a late supper when I get back. You can take the rest of the cake. It 's been out long enough. How you two getting along? Oh, it 's fine. Having him back here has been real nice. He seems like a good man. - Yeah, he is. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here to see you. Not much fun to do here. I 'm trying to keep him from get'n bored. I 'm sure he 's not going to get bored. He just likes spending time with you. You seem like maybe something 's bothering you. You know, you can talk to me about anything. I 'm happy to listen. I guess at times, I could talk to someone about things. I guess I worry about you. Promised your momma I 'd look out for you. and I know how you miss her. The talks you two used to have. We all need someone to talk to. I still miss my little William. But I talk to him everyday. Life has to go on. A person has to be strong, I reckon. I was hoping now that you have your friend back... You 'd have some fun in your life. There I go again. Interfering in your business. No, it 's okay. I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much. Who 's William? I do n't mean to pry, but I... never heard you talk about him. You do n't want to hear about my past. Sure I do. Well, I was married a long time ago. I was only 16. William was his name. He 'd get teased because he was short. But he was a tough man. He was always after me to go out with him. All the time. He 'd send me flowers and candy. Life was so much better then. It was simple People were more decent then. Or maybe I was too simple a person to see the bad. Anyway, I finally gave in to him chasing me. He courted me for a few months. Everything was like a dream. Like... It would only be better if he would ask me to marry him. He asked me one beautiful Saturday afternoon. We were sitting on the porch swing, watching the neighborhood children. He gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments. He thought I was gon na say no. His face got so sad. But I let out a big yes! - You really had him going. - I sure did. So we got married. Practically everyone in town was there. Then came the children. We had two beautiful boys. I feel so bad. All these years... and I never asked you much about your life. We all just stay too busy. Those days are long gone. But you 've lived alone ever since I can remember. That 's what the war did to me. It took my William away from me. Nothing would keep him from protecting his country. I never wanted to marry again. He was my only love. My best friend. Then the Vietnam war came later. Took one of my beautiful sons. He was my little William. Dear God, I hate these wars... But I 'll see them both again someday. Kyle McAllister, you listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! I want to see you happy. You understand me? Yes Ma'am. Every day that goes by, is a day that 's gone forever from your life. I want you to start being the man you really are. You 're like a son to me. I 'm gon na make darn sure you grow old a happy man. Life 's gon na kick you in the rear, but you have to go along with it. To hell with what people might think! So, you do know about me? I guess you 've known for a long time, then. It 's just been so hard hiding it. I 've tried to find a way to live with it, but... You listen to me. That 's just who you are. You be proud of that. And you make your momma proud. That she has such a sweet son. who 's turned out to be such a wonderful man. Well, now that that 's over with, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to be kept waiting on his food.( @knock_on_door)( @knock_on_door) Hello? Come in. It 's cold out there. I 'm sorry to bother you. - It 's okay. Kyle 's not here right now. - Oh. Oh, uh, yeah. I can come back by later. You 're welcome to wait. Can I offer you some coffee? Oh, no, no thank-you. I should n't be here long. Umm... Is there anything I can help you with? Kyle will be back shortly. He was gon na leave me something. A box, or a sack. He just gets things for me at the end of each week. Oh, uh... you know what, it could be in his truck. Oh, okay umm. Well, I guess uh... that 's okay. I could come back tomorrow or, I could come back later. Are you okay? Oh yeah. No, I 'm fine. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this it? Yes! Oh... thank you so much. I do n't know what I would do without Kyle. Been kind of rough, huh? This really helps out me and the kids. He 's been a good friend. Well, umm... I guess you 're visiting Kyle? Yeah. Visiting from the city. Enjoying the few days that I 've been here. I guess it 's different from the city, huh? Yeah, it is. I almost moved once. Well, I... got married. Had kids. You know... uh... things did n't work out? Well, no. He left us a while ago. He 's.. got a new family now. The new family gets a the benefits of a better father. The old family gets nothing. I do what I can. I have two jobs. The boys work after school. We do okay. Especially with friends like Kyle. I guess I 'd better get going. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No, no. I enjoyed listening. You seem like a nice person. Thanks. You do too. You sure you 're okay? You need a ride? Oh no, no. I 'm fine now. Thank you, again. Uh wait. Wait one second. I do n't want you to think of this as charity. Just one friend helping another. What? No! No, I ca n't take that! I can't.( chokesup) It 's okay. Just put it away for when you need it. It 's a gift, okay? Thank you... Well uh... it was nice meeting you... Jake. Jake. Cora. It 's nice meeting you, too. Maybe I 'll see you again. You never know. Life has a funny way of working out, does n't it. Yeah... Thank you... thank you. - Thanks again. - Night. Here you go, sir. I 'll get supper going. Dessert. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say. Look Jake, I know I can never be the man you are. I 'll never be as smart or the same level as you. I do n't have good taste in fancy clothes or furniture. I 'm just a poor country man who ca n't offer much. I can cook, fix cars and ride a horse. But that 's not really the person you need. And I know you 're gon na be leaving soon. And I 'm gon na miss you. Do n't know if we 'll ever see each other again. Maybe if you come visit now and then. But I know how I feel now. I know how I always did feel. I was always thinking about you over the years. Wondering what would 've happened all those years ago. I just hurt so bad when you left that day. So if you ever did decide to move back here... I 'd try to be the best person I could be. But I know that ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to say. I 've thought about this every second. You know. How I 've felt since I 've been back here. All those years... Wondering. Going through my life every day, and you... Never knowing how much it hurt to leave you. You are perfect. Just the way you are. And do n't ever let anyone tell you you 're not. I 'm no better than you. We 've just lived different lives. I 'm still that same little kid... you used to go swimming with... That you used to go riding with. But... If I could live here... I would. So, that 's exactly what I 'm gon na do. Move back here. And live with you. Where I belong. You 'd do all that just for me? What can I say. You can cook. What about your job? It 's the modern age, you know. I can make movies anywhere, even here. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work? My friends will all think I 'm crazy. But it 'll work.( crying) I love you, Jake. Hey Kyle, you up yet? You gon na seep all day? Man, you should have seen this girl last night. She comes right up to me and grabs my ass... I do n't remember much after that.( chuckles) How come you 're not up? You sick or something? Let 's go. Holy fuck! Heath! Oh my God! You 're a big fucking homo! Let me explain! I do n't need you to explain. Just stay away from me! Ca n't we just talk! Heath! Wait up, man! Heath! Wait up, man! I do n't need you to explain to me. I might just be a dumb country boy. But I know a fag when I see one. I know what this is about! That fucking man came here from the city! It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. No Goddamn way! You and me were best friends. Everything was fine ' til he showed up. So do n't tell me you was always like this. Wait! - Get your fucking hands off me! You some kind of, what! What are you, huh? Is every cowboy now one of them broken back cowboys! Jesus Christ Kyle, what 's gon na happen to you now? You 're the only family I got! We 're still cousins, Heath. We 're still best buds. I guess it 'll take a while ' till we can work things out. Guess you feel better, now. Yeah, a little. This ai n't the way it 's supposed to be. There ai n't no easy thing about this. You do n't know what it was like for me all those years. Keeping it a secret. Afraid what people might think. I still got some good life ahead of me! And I ai n't gon na waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really happy. I had no life! Well, what 's gon na happen now? I 'm still me! I 'm still gon na live my life like I always have. Maybe this time, I can live a little better off. Oh, I do n't know, man... It 's gon na take a while to get used to it. I do n't get it. You 're a regular tough cowboy. You could have any girl in town. They 're always asking about you! I guess you are kind of sensitive. Do n't you make me fucking laugh! I got a gun in there. I 'll kill you dead right now! Whatever you say. I got ta get home. Me and Jack Daniels needs some alone time. You ever wonder what it 's all about? The world. The universe. Why we 're here? Yeah. Every day of my life. Wondering, are we in the middle of space? Just to be alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from here? The big question. Ever hear from your dad? My dad? I was hoping to forget about that part of my life. But... yeah. He showed up at mom 's funeral. All those years later. But he was never there for me as a kid. And after the way he treated me and my mom... I could n't see any reason to start being buddies now. So you 'll be leaving tomorrow huh? Yep. Get'n on the road early. To get things started as soon as I get back. A lot of people are gon na be shocked. They wo n't understand how I can leave it all behind. But you know what? It 's okay. They do n't have to understand. We all have our way of thinking about life. It 's up to each person, to find what makes them content. You know... What they can get out of life. We 're stuck with the life we have. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it. And by my calculations... I 've got probably another 38 years... Before I move on to the great beyond. You 're keeping a calendar of it, huh? Oh, I just figure if I 'm gon na make the most of my life... I 'd better make it all count... from now on. That 's a good way of thinking about it.( Jakesighs)( Kylesighs)
