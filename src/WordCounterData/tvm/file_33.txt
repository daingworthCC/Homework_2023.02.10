' And then the legend has it, and I suspect the legend may even be true, ' that he had 100 taken at random and killed them. ' And the reason was a particularly simple one ' from Mobutu 's point of view.

' Rarely has anyone ever been welcomed the way King could do it. ' ' A joy came off him.

" " Ugly and venomous like a toad yet wears a precious jewel. " How many fight promoters have tried even one line of Shakespeare? I can relate to the denial they are confronted with, the rat-infested hovels, sub-standard tenements, overcrowded tenements. I 've been a part of it. I know about roaches and rats.

What would happen if you took a small part of the vast sums of money being made from the fight and put it into something that was... that would help a number of people rather than a few?

I would say let me engender a large amount of money, if it 's possible, and then do n't just let the money sit there and wither away and die but put it into the sun so it could germinate, blossom and grow.( Hauser) ' He 's a remarkable man. ' Don King is one of the brightest people I 've ever met, ' he 's one of the most charismatic people I 've ever met, ' he 's one of the hardest working people I 've ever met.

I realise how unfortunate and uncomfortable it is for you guys to have travelled so far and expecting so much and getting so little.( Mailer) ' George Foreman was a phenomenon. ' He was almost like a physical guru. ' He almost never spoke but it was always arresting. ' You never quite knew what he meant, it might be deep or non-responsive. ' He was Negritude. He was this huge Black force. ' Because of this I had expected Muhammad Ali to be here today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you some entertainment. Now when I go in the ring, you see what kind of mind I got now? Oh! Oh! I just got to pound him. I 'm not gon na even realise... I might look at his face and say, " How 'd I do that? " Allah, God, I 'm his tool. God got in me on purpose for my people. God has made this man look like a little kid. His so-called right hand ai n't nothing now, I do n't even feel ' em! I walk right in and take my shots because I have God in my mind. I 'm thinking of my people being free and I can help with just one fight. He looks little in comparison to what I 'm getting from it!

And the white press, the power structure rank me to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Norton and the rest of them and get scared. But my God controls the universe.( Plimpton) ' I was interested in people called " f? ticheurs ". ' They are witches, soothsayers, ' and in Western Africa almost everybody has one. ' They go to a witch doctor the way we would go to a dentist. ' Muhammad Ali had been to Mobutu 's f? ticheur. And... He had said that... The f? ticheur had said that a woman with trembling hands would somehow get to Foreman. A succubus. ' And that impressed me enormously. '( Ceremonialbandplaying)( Mailer) ' The heavyweight championship produces an excitement ' that 's unlike almost any other spectacle. ' It 's almost physically unendurable ' to wait for that bell to ring for the first round. ' In 1974 in Zaire, the fight started at four in the morning, ' in order that it could be shown on TV in America ' at a reasonable hour like 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) ' Before the fight, I saw a scene that was incomparable. ' Ali 's dressing room was like a morgue. ' It was like The Last Supper. And at a certain point Ali said, " Why is everyone... " so unhappy? " What is the matter with all of you? " The sense was that we were watching a man who was going out to be... going out to the gallows. They all believed he was gon na get defeated and they were terrified. They thought that with his pride he would take one of the world 's worst beatings ever and he would n't give up. And he was gon na be destroyed. Killed or maimed, they knew not what. But they were deeply frightened, as if they were taking whatever fear Ali might have had and absorbing it. After a while he looked at Bundini and said, " We 're gon na dance tonight. " They said, " You 're gon na dance! " Muhammad Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do?! " They said, " Dance! " He said, " Yes! And that man 's gon na be bewildered! " I 'm gon na dance and dance! " And they said, " You 're gon na dance! " I swear they were all crying. And he built them up to a degree so that for him they became half-happy.( Commentator) Here comes the Ali people out of the dressing room and all of the questions will be answered. The awesome power of George Foreman against the varied boxing skills of Muhammad Ali. It 's age against youth. The experience of Muhammad Ali against the youth and brute force and blinding speed. You can hear the band strike up in the background as Ali moves to the ring. This is what Muhammad Ali lives for, this is the man 's life. This may be an historic event, Muhammad Ali coming into the boxing ring for the last time. Should Muhammad Ali retire, this will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event. Here comes the heavyweight champion of the world, George Foreman, jogging out! George Foreman decked out in his red robes, coming in with his people.( Mailer) ' No one in the press ever saw Mobutu ' and he did n't come to the fight. ' He watched the fight on closed circuit. ' It was the only one in Zaire. ' He was terribly afraid of assassination. ' This stadium was a true arena for gladiators. ' The floor you could not see beneath the floor was covered with blood. ' That blood had been washed away but the effect was still there. '( Commentator) There was talk about the possibility of rain, I do n't think the weather could be any more beautiful than it is. Ali is getting the people to chant! " Ali, boma ye, " that means " Ali, kill him. "( Mailer) ' The atmosphere before the bell rang for that first round ' was as intense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stare, Muhammad Ali talking to George Foreman. Really staring at each other. Foreman looking serious, Ali definitely talking. Look at the stare on Foreman. Look at Ali give him the word. The stage is set, we 're just about ready to begin round one. The championship is at stake and $5 million will be paid to both fighters. Ali ready, Foreman ready, we 're waiting for the bell. Here we go, Ali quickly across the ring. Round one, Ali bouncing around, shifting left to right. George moves slow, Ali gets the first punch in, a light right-hand taken on the forehead by the champion. Foreman moving slow, stalking. Ali looks like he 's ready to go here. He 's not staying away, he 's going after his man. Foreman cautious in the first round, looking to drop that left hook. Foreman 's locked his man to the far corner. There 's that left upper-cut into the body of Muhammad Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Foreman. Foreman dances... Ali with a right-hand lead! Has Foreman slightly confused with that right-hand lead, which I have n't seen too many times before. A right-hand lead, where you throw your right without countering, you throw it first, like a jab. That has to travel that extra distance across the shoulders. ' Professionals rarely use this because it 's so dangerous to throw ' since you are open to a left hook. ' Since fighters work in milliseconds ' they can see a right coming much faster than a jab. ' Nobody had thrown a right-hand lead at Foreman in two years, and none of his sparring partners, for $50 a day, was going to start throwing right-hand leads at him because it 's a great insult to a top professional. ' It suggests he 's slow enough that you can hit him with it. ' ' Instead Ali figured out Foreman 's not expecting a right-hand lead. ' " I 'm gon na hit him with a right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand leads, he had n't told anybody he was going to. ' He may have debated whether to up until the last moment. But he did n't knock Foreman down or knock him out. Instead, Foreman went crazy.( Commentator) That punch did no damage. That one did! Two wild right hands taken on the head of Ali! A real strong right hand just underneath the heart. Ali is taking some punishment now! Eight seconds left in the round. Bell rang. Ali went back to the corner... Finally the nightmare he 'd been awaiting in the ring had finally come to visit him. ' He was in the ring with a man he could not dominate, ' who was stronger than him, who was not afraid of him, ' who 'd try to knock him out, and who punched harder than Ali, ' and this man was determined and unstoppable. ' Ali had a look on his face that I 'll never forget. ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes. ' Ali looked as if he looked into himself and said, " All right, this is the moment. " This is what you 've been waiting for. " This is... that hour. " Do you have the guts? " And he kind of nodded, like, " Really got to get it together, boy. " You are gon na get it together... you WILL get it together. " He nodded some more, as if he were looking into the eyes of his maker, and then turned to the crowd and went " Ali, boma ye! " and 100,000 people all yelled back " Ali, boma ye! " And this huge reverberation of the crowd came back into the ring. ' Ali picked it up as if " these are my people, ' " this is what I 'm here for. ' " The time has come, I 'm gon na find a way to master this man. " '( Commentator) Ali tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange.( Mailer) ' Foreman, like everyone, had assumed that Ali would dance, ' and so Ali now went to the ropes and went into the Rope-a-Dope. ' And a lot of people thought that moment the fight was over. ' Especially on TV, it looked like Foreman was killing a very weak Ali. ' You do n't go to the ropes. And there he was, leaning way back. ' I wrote about it, like a man leaning out of his window ' trying to see if there 's something on his roof. ' And, you know, taking it. Here were these great broadsides and it looked like he was being set up for the kill. It happened so quickly and so abruptly, that I said, I shouted to Norman, " The fix is in. " ' He 's supposed to go down in the first or second. ' Ropes is halfway house to the floor. ' ' It just looked as though he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very powerful hooks with both hands.( Mailer) ' They became so basic that they were like two kids fighting. ' ' For that round and the next round and the next round ' Ali lay against the ropes, and he kept talking to Foreman. ' It was extraordinary. ' You had to be close to see it. ' ' And Foreman was throwing these prodigious punches ' and Ali swung like a man in the rigging. ' He 'd go all the way back, he 'd slide out like that. Occasionally, he 'd get hit and he 'd say " George, you disappoint me. " You do n't hit as hard as I thought you would, George, " you 're not breaking popcorn! " ' And Foreman 's insane with rage, ' wanging at him and wanging at him, ' powerful, powerful, powerful. ' And middle of the fifth round Foreman had punched himself out. ' It had taken three rounds. '( Commentator) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five. First good combination by Ali lands on the head of Foreman. Foreman with that right hook. Ali scores a hook! Quick jab with the right backs up Foreman! Backs him up in his tracks! Foreman tries the hook! Ali goes to the right! Foreman gets knocked to the left! Foreman hit again! Foreman has been hit three or four times! Ali came off the ropes and hit him a right and you can see the sweat pour off like a fountain off Foreman 's face and you suddenly realised there was design in this madness. So I turned to Norman, he was somewhat puzzled, but I said, " The succubus has got him! ", referring to this woman with the trembling hands that the witch doctors had said would touch Foreman and destroy him.( Commentator).. Ali 's tactics, to let the man punch himself out. 30 seconds left in round eight. Very even fight. Ali a sneaky right hand. Another sneaky right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination! Two... three... Four... five... Foreman gets up to the knee at eight! That 's it! The fight is stopped! Muhammad Ali with a dramatic eighth round knockout! He knocks out... George Foreman! He 's done it! Muhammad Ali has done it! Muhammad Ali has... Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali...( Translator) ' Muhammad Ali, he was like a sleeping elephant. ' You can do whatever you want around a sleeping elephant, ' but when he wakes up... he tramples everything. '( Crowdroars) Muhammad Ali, boma ye. Boma ye. Muhammad Ali, boma ye George Foreman. He did it. ' He 's champion again, we could n't believe it. ' It was such a classic performance and so beautiful ' that at the moment Ali hit the knockout punch, ' Foreman began to go, Ali followed him around, ' Ali had his right cocked for one more punch ' but he never threw it, ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this man going down. ' One has mixed emotions when you see the end of a fight. ' I always feel sympathy for the man losing it, ' particularly when you see a titanic, formidable figure ' suddenly on the ground. '( Mailer) ' Now, when we see George on TV, ' and know that after that knockout ' he went through two years of the deepest depression, ' he almost did n't come out of it. ' To see the man who 's come out of it, ' the way he reconstructed his personality, ' it 's hard to find anyone in America more affable than George Foreman. ' Foreman has become a fabulous person in American life. ' Just as the fight finished, the monsoons, the African rains, came, and they came so hard that the waters were about three feet deep in the dressing rooms where we 'd just been an hour ago, I 'd never seen such a downpour. And we rode back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were crowds on the roads standing in the pouring rain leaping up and down because news had got around that Ali had won.( Mailer) ' He stayed up all night from what I heard, ' and in the morning he spoke to African groups who 'd come to see him, ' and they more than revered him, he was a god. ' And he spoke to them very simply and beautifully, ' and he said, " Afro-Americans, in America, ' " we 're not as good as you are. ' " Some of us are richer than you are, ' " but you have a dignity in your poverty that we do n't have. ' " We are spoiled in America, ' " we have lost what you still have in Africa and you must keep that. " ' And I thought, on top of everything else he 's a political leader ' and he 's gon na be a great political leader. ' I have a lot of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problems we have to solve among ourselves. Prostitution, dope, gang fights. Knowledge of self. Black people have no knowledge of themselves. We have been made just like white people mentally. White people have made us so much like them it 's hard to teach them about themselves, it 's hard to teach them to unite and marry and be with their own. Black people are now like white people, we have to re-brainwash ' em now, teach them about themselves and their history and language, to do something for themselves and quit begging white people for things they should do themselves. I never heard Ali say he would never fight again. If he had said it, and usually he told the truth, I would n't have believed it. He was born to fight, born for the ring and loved it, he truly loved fighting. And... as happens with people who love a thing too much, it destroys them. It was Oscar Wilde that said you destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round, what you love destroys you.( Mailer) ' He came back, he had 22 fights. ' Some were most honourable, some very difficult. ' Some were comedies and farces. ' He hurt himself in those 22 fights after the fight in Africa. '( Plimpton) ' There is a tendency to look at Muhammad and say ' he 's wounded, he 's ill. ' There are no intellectual deficits, it 's a motor skills problem ' and he does n't try to hide his condition. ' He goes out and lets the whole world see it. ' He does n't feel sorry for himself ' and there 's really no reason for anybody else to feel sorry for him. ' He loves being Muhammad Ali, ' he truly believes that he 's doing God 's work ' and he 's as happy with each day as anybody I know. '( Lee) ' Today 's young generation, they do n't know anything. ' Something happened last year, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great great stories, great historic events, and I 'm not talking about 1850s stuff, they do n't know who Malcolm X is, they do n't know who JFK is, Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, you can go down the line. And it 's scary. ' They 're missing a lot if they do n't know the legacy of Muhammad Ali, ' because no matter what era you live in, ' you see very few true heroes. '( @crowd_chanting) Ali, boma ye!

Esquire was giving a party for various people who had distinguished themselves in Esquire that year. Ali, for whatever he 'd done, I was there probably because I had a good story in Esquire that year, maybe 25 of us, honoured guests, I was there with my wife and we saw Ali and we were talking with him and he could n't have been nicer. I remember I was 62 then, cos he said, " How old are you now? " I said " 62, " he said " Oh, " same as when we were jogging that night, " Oh, I hope I 'm as young as you are when I 'm 62, " he went on like that. I got so pleased and so vain that, you know, I 'm like a dog. What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I did. I went away and once I was gone he turned to my wife, who 's much younger than I am, and he looked at her hard and said, " You still with that old man? " And for me that 's always been... That 's Ali. You love him even when you turn your back on him. I heard him once talking to the Harvard senior class commencement. He gave this extraordinary speech, you know he was dyslexic, and he would look at a paper and say, " What does this word mean? " I 'd say, " Appendicitis. " He 'd say, " How d' you get a word like appendicitis? It 's so long. " Here he was delivering a lecture, senior class day with these 1,000, 2,000 Harvard graduates, and... he had these little cards in front of him. He gave this wonderful speech about he had n't had the opportunity but they had and they should use that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funny, and a great roar of appreciation at the end. Then someone shouted out, " Give us a poem! " And everybody quieted down. Now, the shortest poem according to Bartlett 's Quotations is called " On the Antiquity of Microbes " and the poem is " Adam had ' em. " Pretty short. But Muhammad Ali 's poem was " Me, we. " Two words. I wrote Bartlett 's Quotations and I said, " Look, that 's shorter. " It stands for something more than the poem itself. " Me, we. " What a fighter he was.
