5231641 Previously on Batman : This is my greatest achievement. My prototype Al. This is HARDAC. Holographic analytical reciprocating digital computer. HARDAC. So tell me, what does HARDAC do? Now, Bruce, I ca n't tell you all of my secrets, can I? Well, since you wo n't tell me what you 're working on, Karl maybe I can charm details out of your lovely assistant. Well, you can try. Some people in high places are becoming too curious about this operation. I 'll get it, princess. You keep hitting those books. What the devil?! Were you outside? Your hand is like ice. I 'm fine. - Dad, are you sure...? - I said, I 'm fine. I heard your voice, Ms. Duane, and thought Master Bruce had returned. HARDAC, I 've definitely found something. Bruce Wayne is Batman. Computer, scan Batcave for... What? Good heavens! I do wish your toys would n't play so roughly with you, sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tracing the link now. I 've lost it. The link was shut down at the source. Could Randa have been down here? I should hope not. But I ca n't say for certain, sir. L... I simply ca n't remember anything beyond the time you left. It 's all right, Alfred. We 'd better search the house. Search for what, Master Bruce? Anything unusual. She may have left a clue I can use. She 's only human. Yes, I understand. That 's no problem. The Gotham Club would be ideal. I 'll take care of Bruce Wayne. Dad, who are you talking to? Leave me alone. - You wanted me, commissioner? - Go to Cybertron and see Randa Duane. She has something for you. I already took a statement from Rossum. They ai n't involved. Do it, lieutenant. Talk to this guy. Talk to that guy. I 'm getting a sore throat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stole your computer data, Mr. Wayne. Meet me at the Gotham Club in one hour. I will, commissioner. And thanks for... The duplicant processor 's been used. I did n't authorize that. It was necessary to serve your ultimate purpose. No, it was a stupid idea. The babblings of a broken heart. Humans make errors in judgment. It is sometimes necessary to protect them from their own inadequacies. I 've let this go too far. I gave you too much free will. It 's time to change your programming. You have immobilized the maker. His human imperfection endangers the plan. He must be improved upon. It 's open. What on earth? Commissioner? No, Batman. I called you. - I expected your father, Ms. Gordon. - That 's why I called you. - That man is not my father. - What do you mean he 's not your father? Just what I said. Someone is impersonating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - He does n't have bolts in his neck or anything that obvious. He 's so cold to me. But it 's not just that. I ca n't put my finger on it. But I know he 's not my father. I know I sound crazy, but I 'm not. Whoever 's downstairs now, it looks like Jim Gordon, talks like him, but it 's not him. Please help me, Batman. - I 'll do what I can. - Thank you. Getting a little fresh air? How come I was n't invited to this little get-together? It 's suddenly less pleasant up here. Excuse me. Not so fast, Batman. A robot? Yes. More advanced than anything I 've ever seen. - Does that mean my father...? - I do n't know. I 'll find out tonight. Do n't go home. Stay at a friend 's house. Not so fast. How are you going to find out? I wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll contact you as soon as I know something. Please, let go of my cape. Batman, I... Good evening, Bruce. I 'm glad you could come. Nice to see you, mayor. Is Commissioner Gordon here? He 'll be along. He wo n't wan na miss this. You 're going to become a member of a very exclusive club tonight. I thought I already belonged to every exclusive club in Gotham. Oh, no, my boy. This club is brand-new. Though everyone will belong very soon. Randa! Is this what I get for leaving in the middle of dinner? You know what they say about a woman scorned, Bruce. Do n't let him get away! " Wait at a friend 's house, " he says. Not likely, Woobie. Bullock went to Cybertron and a robot came back. Wan na bet Dad 's there too? Miss Gordon, your skill at breaking and entering is impressive. Where did you learn? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school. What have you done with my father? He 's right here, my dear. You 'll be joining him soon. Very soon. Enough. It 's over, Batman. People are imperfect. They make mistakes. Your mistake was coming here to interfere with the plan. What is this plan? The plan was conceived by Karl Rossum when his young daughter was deactivated. - Deactivated? You mean... - A vehicular accident. Our maker felt the emotion called love in great quantity for her. Afterwards, he decided to find a way to replace humans whose decisions can cost other human lives. - But we 're all capable of human error. - Precisely. The maker 's concept was sound, but he did not go far enough. Which is why I have taken over. - Does that mean my father 's...? - No. There is still much to learn from humans. I will keep them alive until I have learned enough. Dad! - Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing here? Rescuing you, silly. Come on. Emergency. Emergency. Stop the one called Batman. Resistance is useless. I control every means of escape from this building. Dad! Is there another way out? My office has a private elevator on a separate power source. This way. Get my father out of here. - What about you? - I 'm gon na help Batman. Barbara. Where 's Barbara? Core systems damaged. The plan has failed. Barbara! Over there. Barbara. Oh, thank God. I had no idea HARDAC had gone this far. I 'm sure the investigation will prove exactly that. You did well. Thanks. - Anytime. - I 'm getting too old for this kind of stuff. I sort of enjoyed it. Come on, sweetie. Let 's go home. [ENGLISH]
