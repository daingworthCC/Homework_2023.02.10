With my husband. Oh, how sad. But then I ' m sure he 's the sort of man who would n't mind if we danced. What do you do, Alice? Well, at the moment...... I 'm lookingforajob. I used to manage an art gallery in SoHo. But it went broke. What a shame. I have some friends in the art game. Perhaps I can be of some help. Thank you. Someone you know? My...... husband. Do n't you think one of the charms of marriage...... isthatit makesdeception a necessity for both parties? May I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, wants to be married? Why would n't she? is it as bad as that? As good as that. Do you know Nuala Windsor? No, and it 's very lovely to meet you both. How do you spell Nuala? N-U-A-L-A. You do n't remember me, do you? You were very kind to me once. Only once? That sounds like a terrible oversight! I was doing a photo session in Rockefeller Plaza...... ona verywindyday...? - And you got something in your eye. - Just about half of Fifth Avenue. You were such a gentleman! You gave me your handkerchief...... whichwasalsoclean. That is the kind of hero I can be sometimes. You know why women used to get married, do n't you? Why do n't you tell me? It was the only way they could lose their virginity...... andbefreetodo what they wanted with other men. The one's they really wanted. Fascinating. Do you know what 's so nice about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They always seem so...... knowledgeable. Oh, they are very knowledgeable...... aboutallsortsofthings. But I bet they work too hard. Just think of all they miss. You ' re probably right. Ladies, where exactly are we going? Exactly? Where the rainbow ends. Where the rainbow ends? Do n't you want to go where the rainbow ends? Now that depends where that is. Well, let 's find out. Excuse me, ladies. Sorry, Dr. Harford. Could you come with me for a moment? Something for Mr. Ziegler. Fine. To be continued? Bill, thanks for coming. We had a little accident here. What happened? Well, she was.... She was shooting up and she had a bad reaction. What did she take? A speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it. It 's heroin and coke. Heroin and coke? Anything else? We had a couple of drinks, some champagne. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this? Maybe five minutes, six minutes, something like that. What 's her name? Mandy. Can you hear me, Mandy? Can you hear me? Move your head if you can hear me. Move your head if you can hear me, Mandy.

You know that, do n't you? I know. Well, Victor...... I'llleavetheresttoyou. is it okay if I dress her and get her out of here? No, I 'd keep her here for another hour. Another hour? Then I 'd have someone take her home. Good night, Mandy. I ca n't thank you enough for this. - You saved my ass. - l ' m glad I was here. Bill, I probably.... I know I do n't have to mention this...... butthisis justbetweenus. Of course. Thanks. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I have to go and find my husband now.

" " ' T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. " " Okay. That 's fine. You can put your gown on. Hold this for Mommy. Looking forward to Christmas? Does this hurt? Right there? Daddy 's gon na like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me...... whenI jumpintomybed. " " We should call the Zieglers and thank them for the party. I 've taken care of that. Good. So how do you feel about wrapping the rest of the presents? Let 's do that tomorrow. Tell me something. Those two girls...... atthepartylastnight.... Did you...... byanychance...... happento...... fuckthem? What? What are you talking about? I ' m talking about the two girls...... thatyouweresoblatantly hitting on. I was n't hitting on anybody. Who were they? They were just a couple of models. And where did you disappear to with them for so long? Wait a minute. I did n't disappear with anybody. Ziegler was n't feeling too well...... and_i gotcalledupstairs to see him. Anyway, who was the guy you were dancing with? A friend of the Zieglers. What did he want? What did he want? Sex...... upstairs. Then and there. is that all? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife. That 's right. Well, I guess that 's understandable. Understandable? Because you are a very...... verybeautifulwoman. Wait. Because I ' m a beautiful woman...... theonlyreasonany man ever wants to talk to me...... isbecausehe wantstofuck me. is that what you ' re saying? Well, I do n't think it 's quite that black and white...... butI think_we bothknow what men are like. So on that basis...... Ishouldconcludethatyou wanted to fuck those two models. There are exceptions. And what makes you an exception? What makes me an exception is that...... Ihappento be in lovewithyou. And because we ' re married...... andbecauseIwouldnever lie to you...... orhurtyou. Do you realize that what you ' re saying...... isthattheonlyreasonyou would n't fuck those models...... isoutof considerationfor me? Not because you really would n't want to. Let 's just relax, Alice. This pot is making you aggressive. No! It 's not the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a straight fucking answer? I was under the impression that 's what I was doing. I do n't even know what we ' re arguing about here. I ' m not arguing. I ' m just trying to find out where you ' re coming from. Where I ' m coming from? Let 's say, for example, you have some gorgeous woman...... **25;156;TOOLONG...... andyou 're feelingher fuckingtits. Now, what I want to know.... I want to know what you ' re thinking about when you ' re squeezing them. Alice, I happen to be a doctor. It 's all very impersonal...... andyouknow there 's always a nurse present. So when you ' re feeling tits, it 's nothing more than your professionalism? Exactly. Sex is the last thing on my mind when I ' m with a patient. Now, when she is having her little titties squeezed...... doyouthinkshe ever has fantasies...... aboutwhathandsomeDr. Bill 's dickie might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is the last thing...... **25;183;TOOLONG woman patient 's mind. And what makes you so sure? If for no better reason...... becauseshe'safraidof what I might find. So after you tell her that everything 's fine, what then? What then? I do n't know, Alice.... What then? Women do n't.... They basically just do n't think like that. Millions of years of evolution, right? Men have to stick it every place they can...... butforwomen, itisjustabout security and commitment...... andwhateverthefuckelse! A little oversimplified, Alice. But yes, something like that. If you men only knew. What I do know is you got stoned, you tried to pick a fight...... andnowyou'retrying to make me jealous. But you ' re not the jealous type, are you? No, I ' m not. You 've never been jealous about me, have you? No, I have n't. And why have n't you ever been jealous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Maybe because you ' re my wife. Maybe because you ' re the mother of my child...... and_i knowyouwouldnever be unfaithful to me. You are very, very sure of yourself...... aren't_you? No. I ' m sure of you. Do you think that 's funny? All right. Fuck it. Now we get the fucking laughing fit, right? Do you.... Do you remember last summer at Cape Cod? Do you remember one night in the dining room...... **29;210;TOOLONG...... andhewassittingnear ourtable with two other officers? No. The waiter brought him a message, at which point he left. Nothing rings a bell? Well...... Ifirstsawhim that morning in the lobby. He was checking into the hotel...... **27;241;TOOLONG with his luggage...... totheelevator. He glanced at me as he walked past. Just a glance. Nothing more. But I could hardly...... move. That afternoon......

And I thought if he wanted me...... evenifit wasonly...... foronenight...... Iwasreadytogive upeverything. You. Helena. My whole fucking future. Everything. And yet it was weird, because at the same time...... **25;270;TOOLONG. And at that moment, my love for you...... wasboth...... tenderandsad.

How good of you to come. I came as soon as I got the message. Thank you. - l ' m so sorry. - Thank you. Your father was.... He was a very brave man. Oh, thank you. How are you holding up? I ' m a bit numb. I do n't think it 's really sunk in yet. Would you like to sit down? It 's so unreal. Daddy had such a good day. His mind was clear, and he remembered so many things. Then he had a little dinner...... andhesaidhefelt like taking a nap. I went into the kitchen and talked to Rosa for half an hour at most...... **25;297;TOOLONG...... Ijustthoughthewasasleep.
