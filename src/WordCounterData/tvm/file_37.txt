5215641 Long ago, in the far away land of ancient Greece... there was a golden age of powerful gods... and extraordinay heroes. And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes... was the mighty Hercules. But what is the measure of a true hero? Ah, that is what our story is... Will you listen to him? He 's makin ' the story sound like some Greek tragedy. Lighten up, dude. We 'll take it from here, darling. You go, girl. We are the muses... goddesses of the arts and proclaimers of heroes. Heroes like Hercules. Honey, you mean " Hunk-ules ". Ooh, I 'd like to make some sweet music with him... Our story actually begins... long before Hercules... many eons ago. Ah Back when the world was new - Whoa! - The planet Earth was down on its luck And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok It was a nasty place There was a mess wherever you stepped Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept Whoo! Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hurled his thunderbolt - He zapped - Locked those suckers in a vault - They 're trapped And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks And that 's the gospel truth The guy was too " TypeA " to just relax - And that 's the world 's first dish - Yeah, baby. Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth Though, honey it may seem impossible That 's the gospel truth On Mount Olympus life was neat And smooth as sweet vermouth Although, honey it may seem impossible That 's the gospel truth - Ah, ah - Ah - Ah, ah - Oh, yeah, yeah - Ah, ah - Hey, hey, hey - Ah, ah - Hey, yeah Hercules! Behave yourself. Oh, look at this. Look how cute he is. Hah! Oh, he 's strong... like his dad, hmm? Whoa! Excuse me! Hot stuff coming through! Excuse me. One side, Ares. Why, Hermes, they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the arrangement. Is n't that too nutty? Fabulous party. You know, I have n't seen this much love in a room... since Narcissus discovered himself. Dear, keep those away from the baby. Oh, he wo n't hurt himself. Let the kid have a little fun. On behalf of my son, I want to thank you all... for your wonderful gifts! What about our gift, dear? Well, let 's see here. We 'll take... Hmm, yes. A little cirrus and, uh, hmm, a touch of nimbostratus... and a dash of cumulus. His name is Pegasus... and he 's all yours, son. Mind his head. He 's so tiny. My boy. My little Hercules. How sentimental. You know, I have n't been this choked up... since I got a hunk of moussaka caught in my throat! Huh? So is this an audience or a mosaic? Hey, how you doin '? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you finally made it. How are things in the underworld? Well, they 're just fine. You know, a little dark, a little gloomy. And, as always, hey, full of dead people. What are you gon na do? Ah! There 's the little sunspot. Little snootchie. And here is a sucker for the little sucker. Eh? Here you go. You just... Sheesh! Uh, powerful little tyke. Come on, Hades. Do n't be such a stiff. Join the celebration! Hey. Love to, babe... but unlike you gods lounging about up here... I regrettably have a full-time gig... that you, by the way, so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus. So, ca n't. Love to, but ca n't. You ought to slow down. You 'll work yourself to death. Hah! Work yourself to death! Oh, I kill myself! If only. If only. If there 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Hades. ' Cause he had an evil plan. He ran the underworld But thought the dead were dull and uncouth He was as mean as he was ruthless And that 's the gospel truth He had a plan to shake things up And that 's the gospel truth Pain! Coming, your most lugubriousness. Ow! - Panic! - Oh, I 'm sory. I can handle it! - Pain! Oh! - And Panic! Reporting for duty! Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know the instant the Fates arrive. Oh. They 're here. What? The Fates are here, and you did n't tell me? We are worms! Worthless worms! Memo to me, memo to me : maim you after my meeting. Darling, hold that mortal 's thread of life... good and tight. Incoming! Ladies. I am so sorry that I 'm... - Late! - We knew you would be. We know eveything. - Past. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gon na be big. Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I was at this party and I lost track of... - We know! - Yeah. I know you know. So here 's the deal. Zeus... Mr High and Mighty, Mr " Hey, You, Get Off Of My Cloud ",... now he has... - A bouncing baby brat. - We know! I know you know! I know. I got it. I got the concept. So let me just ask : is this kid gon na mess up my hostile takeover bid, or what? - What do you think? - Oh, no you do n't. We 're not supposed to reveal the future. Oh, wait. I 'm sorry. Time out. Can I... Can I ask you a question by the way? Are you... Did you cut your hair or something? You look fabulous. I mean, you look like a Fate worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinkin '! Ladies, please. My fate... is in your lovely hands. - Oh. - Oh, all right. In 18 years precisely... the planets will align... ever so nicely. Ay, verse. Oy. The time to act will be at hand. Unleash the Titans, your monstrous band. Mm-hmm. Good, good. Then the once-proud Zeus will finally fall... and you, Hades... will rule all! Yes! Hades rules! - A word of caution to this tale. - Excuse me? Should Hercules fight, you will fail. What? Okay, fine, fine. I 'm cool. I 'm fine. Pain? Panic? Got a little riddle for ya. How do you kill a god? I do not know! You ca n't. They 're immortal? Bingo! They 're immortal! So, first you got to turn the little sunspot... mortal. - Huh? - Wha... What is it? The baby! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Zeus is gon na use us for target practice! Just hang on to the kid, Panic! Hurry! Let 's just kill the kid and get it over with, okay? Here you go, kid. A little Grecian formula. Look at that! He 's changing. Can we do it now? No, no, no. He has to drink the whole potion. - every last drop! - Who 's there? Alcmene, over here. Oh, you poor thing. - Oh, do n't cy. - Is anybody there? - Now? - Now. Oh. Well, he must have been abandoned. Amphityon, for so many years... we 've prayed to the gods to bless us with a child. Perhaps they 've answered our prayers. Perhaps they have. " Hercules "? Help, help, help! Hades is gon na kill us when he finds out what happened. You mean, if he finds out. Of course he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods on a frantic search. But by the time they found the baby, it was too late. - Young Herc was mortal now - Mmm But since he did not drink the last drop He still retained his godlike strength - So thank his lucky stars - Tell it, girl. - But Zeus and Hera wept - Ooh, ooh, ooh Because their son could never come home They 'd have to watch their precious baby Grow up from a far Though Hades ' horrid plan Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth - Ahh - The boy grew stronger everyday And that 's the gospel truth The gospel truth Hercules, slow down! Look out! Oops! S-S-sorry, guys! - Hey, watch where you 're goin '! - Sunday driver! Thanks, son. When old Penelope twisted her ankle back there, I thought we were done for. - No problem, Pop. - Uh, don't-don't-do n't unload just yet. First, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. sorry, Penelope. Now, Hercules, this time, please just... I know, I know. Stay by the cart. That 's my boy. Oh, my goodness. Whoa! Careful! - Why, thank you. - No problem. Why, Hercules! I-I-It 's you! - Let me, let me help you with that. - No, no, no, no, no. I got it! I 'm fine. You just run along. - Are you sure? - Oh, yes. Absolutely. Yo! Give it here! Hey, you need an extra guy? Uh, sorry, Herc. Uh, we already got five... and we want to keep it an even number. - Hey, wait a second. Five is n't an ev... - See ya, Herc. - What a geek! - Destructo Boy. - Maybe we should call him " Jerkules ". - Yeah! Heads up! - I-I got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no. It 's okay. Hey! Whoa! - Son! - Hang on, Pop! Be right back! Oh, my! Oh, no! Do n't! Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Watch out! Nice catch, Jerkules. Son. This is the last straw, Amphityon! That boy is a menace! He 's too dangerous to be around normal people! He did n't mean any harm. He 's just a kid. He-He just ca n't control his strength. I 'm warning you. You keep that-that-that... freak away from here! Freak! Yeah, go away! Son, you should n't let those things they said back there get to ya. But, Pop, they 're right. I-I am a freak. I-I try to fit in. I really do. I just ca n't. Sometimes I feel like... like I really do n't belong here... like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son... I know it does n't make any sense. I have often dreamed Of a far-offplace Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me Where the crowds will cheer When they see my face And a voice keeps sayin ' this is where I 'm meant to be I will find my way I can go the distance I 'll be there someday If I can be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere to feel like I Belong Hercules, there 's something your mother and I... have been meaning to, to tell ya. But if you found me, then where did I come from? Why was I left here? This was around your neck when we found you. It 's the symbol of the gods. This is it! Do n't you see? Maybe they have the answers. I 'll go to the temple of Zeus and... Ma, Pop... you 're the greatest parents anyone could have, but... I-I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go the distance I do n't care how far Somehow, I 'll be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere To find where I belong Oh, mighty Zeus... please, hear me and, and answer my prayer. I need to know : Who am I? Wh-Where do I belong? Huh? My boy. My little Hercules. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, kiddo! What 's your hurry? After all these years... is this the kind of hello you give your father? F-F-Father? Did n't know you had a famous father, did you? Surprise! Look how you 've grown. Why, you 've got your mother 's beautiful eyes... and my strong chin. - Hah! - I-I do n't understand. If you 're my father, that would make me a... A god. A god. A god! Hey, you wanted answers, and by thunder... you 're old enough now to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth? Did n't you want me? Of course we did. Your mother and I loved you with all our hearts. But someone stole you from us and turned you mortal... and only gods can live on Mount Olympus. And you ca n't do a thing? I ca n't, Hercules, but you can. R-Really? W-What? I 'll do anything. Hercules, if you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth... your godhood will be restored. A true hero. Great! Uh, exactly how do you become a true hero? First, you must seek out Philoctetes, the trainer of heroes. Seek out Philoctetes. Right. I 'll... - Whoa! - Whoa! Hold your horses! Which reminds me. Ha-ha! You probably do n't remember Pegasus... but you two go way back, son. Oh, Pegasus! He 's a magnificent horse... with the brain of a bird. I 'll find Philoctetes, become a true hero! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father! Yee-hah! Good luck, son. I will beat the odds I can go the distance I will face the world Fearless, proud and strong I will please the gods I can go the distance Till I find my hero 's welcome Right where I Belong Whoa! - You sure this is the right place? - What 's the matter, little guy? You stuck? - Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy! - Ugh! Girls! Stop! Stop! Come back! Come back, come back! Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez! Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, nymphs! - They ca n't keep their hands off me. - Hey! What 's the matter? You never seen a satyr before? Uh, no. Can you help us? We 're looking for someone called Philoctetes. - Call me Phil. - Phil! - Ow! - Boy, am I glad to meet you! I 'm Hercules, and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help. I want to become a hero, a true hero. sorry, kid. Ca n't help ya. - Wait. - Whoo! Uh, sorry. Why not? Two words : I am retired. Look, I got ta do this. Have n't you ever had a dream... something you wanted so bad you 'd do anything? Kid, come inside. I want to show you somethin '. Watch it! That was part of the mast of the Argo. - The Argo? - Yeah. Who do you think taught Jason how to sail? Cleopatra? I trained all those would-be heroes. Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus. A lot of " yeuseus ". And every single one of those bums let me down... flatter than a discus. None of_'em could go the distance. And then there was Achilles. Now there was a guy who had it all... the build, the foot speed. He could jab. He could take a hit. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his! He barely gets nicked there once and kaboom! He 's history. Yeah, I had a dream once. I dreamed I was gon na train the greatest hero there ever was. So great, the gods would hang a picture of him in the stars... all across the sky... and people would say, " That 's Phil 's boy ". That 's right. Eh, but dreams are for rookies. A guy can only take so much disappointment. But I 'm different than those other guys, Phil. I can go the distance. Come on. I 'll show ya. Jeez. You do n't give up, do ya? Watch this. Holy Hera. You know, maybe if I... No! Snap out of it! I 'm too old to get mixed up in this stuff again. But if I do n't become a true hero... I 'll never be able to rejoin my father Zeus. Hold it. Zeus is your father, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's your daddy. Mr. Lightning Bolts! Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da? Zeus! " Once upon a time... " - It 's the truth! - Please! So you wan na be a hero, kid Well, whoop-de-do I have been around the block before With blockheads just like you Each and everyone a disappointment Pain for which there ai n't no ointment So much for excuses Though a kid of Zeus is Askin ' me to jump into the fray My answer is two words Okay. You mean you 'll do it? - You win. - You wo n't be sorry, Phil. - Oh, gods. - So when do we start? Can we start now? Oy, vay. I 'd given up hope that someone would come Along A fella who 'd ring the bell for once Not the gong The kind who wins trophies Wo n't settle for low fees At least semipro fees But, no I get the greenhorn I 've been out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and to graze my lawn But you need an advisor A satyr, but wiser A good merchandiser and... whoa There goes my ulcer I 'm down to one last hope, and I hope It 's you Though, kid, you 're not exactly a dream come true It rained enough turkeys - Who nevercame through - Whoa! You 're my one last hope so you 'll have to do Rule number six : when rescuing a damsel... always handle with care. No! Rule number 95, kid : concentrate! Rule number 96 : aim! Demigods have faced the odds And ended up a mockey Do n't believe the stories That you read on all the crockey To be a true hero, kid is a dyin ' art Like painting ' a masterpiece It 's a work of heart It takes more than sinew Comes down to what 's in you You have to continue to grow Now that 's more like it! I 'm down to one lastshot And my last high note Before that blasted underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go make ' em come true Climb that uphill slope Keep pushin ' that envelope You 're my one last hope And, kid, it 's up to You Yeah! Did you see that? Next stop, Olympus. All right. Just take it easy, champ. I am ready. I want to get off this island. I want to see battles and monsters. Rescue some damsels. You know, heroic stuff. - Well. - Aw, come on, Phil! Well, okay, okay. You want a road test? Saddle up, kid. - We 're goin ' to Thebes! - Ya-hoo! - So what 's in Thebes? - A lot of problems. It 's a big, tough town. Good place to start buildin ' a rep. Sounds like your basic DID... - Hyah! - Damsel in distress! Not so fast, sweetheart. I swear, Nessus. Put me down or I 'll... Whoo! I like ' em fiey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation. Do n't just barrel in there without thinking. Eh? He 's losin ' points for this! - You do n't know what you 're... - Halt! Step aside, two legs. Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir. I 'll have to ask you to release that young... - Keep movin ', junior. - Lady. But you... Are-Are n't you a damsel in distress? I 'm a damsel. I 'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day. Uh... Ma'am, I 'm afraid you may be too close to the situation to realize... Ohhh! What are you doin '? Get your sword! Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15 : a hero is only as good as his weapon! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on! He 's got ta do it on his own. Come on, kid! Concentrate! Use your head! Oh. All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind, but not bad. Oh, gee, miss. I 'm, I 'm really sorry. - Oh. - That was dumb. Yeah. Excuse me. Nice work! Excelente. Is Wonderboy here for real? What are you talkin ' about? Of course he 's real. Whoa! And by the way, sweet cheeks. I 'm real too. Ugh! Yee-hah! Ya-hoo! Whoa! - How was that, Phil? - Reign it in, rookie. You can get away with mistakes like those in the minor decathlons... but this is the big leagues! At least I beat him, did n't I? Next time, do n't let your guard down because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes! D-oh! It 's like I keep tellin ' ya. You got ta stay focused, and you... Are you, uh, all right, Miss, uh... Megara. My friends call me Meg. At least they would if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name along with all those rippling pectorals? Uh, uh, uh, I 'm, um, uh... - Uh, uh... - Are you always this articulate? Hercules. My... My name is Hercules. Herc... Huh. I think I prefer Wonderboy. So, uh, uh... How-how-how 'd you get mixed up with the, uh... Pinhead with hooves? Well, you know how men are. They think " No " means " Yes " and " Get lost " means " Take me. I 'm yours ". Do n't worry. Shorty here can explain it to ya later. Well, thanks for everything, Herc. It 's been a real slice. Wait! Um, can we give you a ride? Uh, I do n't think your pinto likes me very much. Pegasus? Oh, no. Do n't be silly. He 'd be more than happy to... Ow! I 'll be all right. I 'm a big tough girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Wonderboy. Bye. She 's somethin '. Is n't she, Phil? Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah. She 's really somethin '. A real pain in the patella! Earth to Herc! Come in, Herc! Come in, Herc! We got a job to do, remember? Thebes is still waitin '. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Aw, how cute. A couple of rodents lookin ' for a theme park. Who you callin ' a rodent, sister? - I 'm a bunny! - A-And I 'm his gopher! Ta-dah! I thought I smelled a rat. - Meg. - Speak of the devil. Meg, my little flower, my little bird, my little nut. Meg. What exactly happened here? I thought you were gon na persuade the river guardian to join my team... for the uprising, and here I am, kind of river guardian-less. I gave it my best shot, but he made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of subtracting two years from your sentence... hey, I 'm gon na add two on, okay? - Give that your best shot. - Look. It was n't my fault. It was this wonderboy, Hercules. Hercules. Why does that name ring a bell? I do n't know. Um, maybe we owe him money? - What was that name again? - Hercules. He comes on with this big, innocent farm boy routine... but I could see through that in a Peloponnesian minute. Wait a minute. Was n't Hercules the name of that kid we were supposed to... Oh, my gods! Run for it! So you took care of him, huh? Dead as a doornail. Were n't those your exact words? This might be a different Hercules. Yeah! I mean, Hercules is a very popular name nowadays! Remember, like, a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason... and the girls were all named Brittany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one schlemiel who can louse it up... is waltzing around in the woods! Wait. Wait, big guy. - We can still cut in on his waltzing. - That 's right. And-And at least we made him mortal. That 's a good thing. Did n't we? Hmm. Fortunately for the three of you... we still have time to correct this rather egregious oversight. And this time, no foul-ups. Wow! - Is that all one town? - One town, a million troubles. The one and only Thebes. The Big Olive itself. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. Stick with me, kid. The city is a dangerous place. - Look where you 're goin ', numbskull! - Hey, I 'm walkin ' here! See what I mean? I 'm tellin ' you. Wackos. Pita bread. Pita bread. Get your pita bread here. - Hey, Mack. - Whoa, whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not interested, all right? Come on, kid. The end is coming! Ca n't you feel it? Yes, yes. Thank you for the info. Yes. We 'll ponder that for awhile. Just stare at the sidewalk. Come on. Do n't make eye contact. People here are nuts. That 's because they live in a city of turmoil. Trust me, kid. You 're gon na be just what the doctor ordered. It was tragic! We lost everything in the fire. everything except old Snowball here. Now were the fires before or after the earthquake? They were after the earthquake. I remember. But before the flood. Do n't even get me started on the crime rate. Thebes has certainly gone downhill in a hurry. Tell me about it. It seems like every time I turn around... there 's some new monster wreaking ' havoc and I... All we need now is a plague of locusts. That 's it! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It, uh... seems to me that what you folks need is a hero. Yeah, and who are you? I 'm Hercules, and, uh... I happen to be a hero. - Is that so? - A hero! Have you ever saved a town before? Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I... Have you ever reversed a natural disaster? Well, uh, no. Oh, listen to thi... He 's just another chariot chaser. This we need. That 's a laugh. - Do n't you pea brains get it? - Hmm? This kid is the genuine article. Hey, is n't that the goat-man who trained Achilles? Watch it, pal. Yeah, you 're right. Hey, uh, nice job on those heels! Ya missed a spot! You... I got your heel right here! I 'll wipe that stupid grin off your face! You... Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil! What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a professional hero... not an amateur. Well, wait. Stop! How am I supposed to prove myself a hero... if nobody will give me a chance? You 'll get your chance. You just need some kind of catastrophe or disaster. Please. Help! Please! There 's been a terrible accident! - Meg? - Speakin ' of disasters. Wonderboy! Hercules! - Thank goodness. - Wha-Wha-What 's wrong? Oh! Outside of town. Two little boys. Th-They were playing in the gorge. Th-There was this rock slide, a terrible rock slide. - They 're trapped! - Kids? Trapped? Phil, this is great! You 're really choked up about this, are n't ya? - Come on! - No, I... You do n't under... I, I have this terrible fear of heights! I 'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo! I 'm way behind ya, kid. I got a fur wedgie. - Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me down before I ruin the upholstey. Help! I ca n't breathe! - Hurry! - Get us out! We 're suffocating! Somebody call IX-I-I! Easy, fellas. You 'll be all right. We ca n't last much longer! Get us out before we get crushed! - How you boys doin '? - We 're okay now. Jeepers, mister. You 're really strong. Well, just ty to be a little more careful next time, okay, kids? We sure will. Stirring performance, boys. I was really moved. " Jeepers, mister "? I was going for innocence. And, hey, two thumbs way, way up for our leading lady. What a dish. What a doll. Get outta there, ya big lug, while ya still can. Phil, I-I did great. They even applauded. Sort of. Huh! I hate to burst your bubble, kid... but that ai n't applause. Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am-scray! Let 's get ready to rumble! That 's it. Dance around! Dance around! Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth! Keep going. Come on. Come on. Lead with your left. Lead with your left. Your other left! Whoa! All right! All right! You 're bad! Okay! See, Phil? That... That was n't so hard. Kid, kid, kid. How many horns do you see? - Six? - Eh, close enough. Let 's get you cleaned up. Guys, guys, relax. It 's only halftime. That does n't sound good. Definitely not good! Will you forget the head-slicing thing? Phil, I do n't think we covered this one in basic training! My favourite part of the game : sudden death. Oh. There goes another one. Just like Achilles. Game... set, match. Hmm? Phil, you got ta admit. That was pretty heroic. Ya did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a landslide! Hades mad. Well, what do you know? From that day forward, our boy Hercules could do no wrong. He was so hot, steam looked cool. Oh, yeah Bless my soul Herc was on a roll Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll - What a pro - Herc could stop a show Point him at a monster and you 're talkin ' SRO - He was a no one - A zero, zero - Now he 's a honcho - He 's a hero Here was a kid with his act down pat Zero to hero in no time flat - Zero to hero - Just like that When he smiled the girls went wild With oohs and aahs And they slapped his face on every vase On every " vahse " From appearance fees and royalties Our Herc had cash to burn Now nouveau riche and famous He could tell you what 's a Grecian urn Say amen There he goes again - Sweet and undefeated - And an awesome ten for ten Folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes He sees, he conquers Honey, the crowds were goin ' bonkers - He showed the moxie brains and spunk - Yeah - From zero to hero - A major hunk - Zero to hero - And who 'd have thunk Who put the glad in gladiator Hercules Whose darin ' deeds are great theatre Hercules - Is n't he bold - No one braver - Is he sweet - Our favourite flavour - Hercules - My man. - Hercules - Hercules - Hercules - Ooh - Hercules - Look at my Hercules - Hercules, Hercules - Yeah, yeah, yeah Bless my soul Herc was on a roll - Undefeated - Riding high - And the nicest guy. - Not conceited - He was a nothing - A zero, zero - Now he 's a honcho - He 's our hero He hit the heights at breakneck speed From zero to hero Herc is a hero Now he 's a hero Yes, indeed Pull! Nice shootin ', Rex. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got at him... and it does n't even... What are those? Um, I do n't know. I-I thought they looked kinda dashing. I 've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo... or the entire scheme I 've been setting up for 18 years goes up in smoke... and you are wearing his merchandise? Thirsty? Looks like your game 's over. Wonderboy is hitting every curve you throw at him. Oh, yeah. I wonder if maybe I have n't been throwing... the right curves at him, Meg, my sweet. Do n't even go there. See, he 's got ta have a weakness... because everybody 's got a weakness. I mean, for what? Pandora, it was the box thing. For the Trojans, hey. They bet on the wrong horse, okay? We simply need to find out Wonderboy 's. I 've done my part. Get your little imps... They could n't handle him as a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man. Hey, I 've sworn off manhandling. Well, you know, that 's good because that 's what got you... into this jam in the first place, is n't it? You sold your soul to me to save your boyfriend 's life. And how does this creep thank you? By running off with some babe. He hurt you real bad, did n't he, Meg? Huh? Look, I learned my lesson, okay? Which is exactly why I got a feelin '... you 're gon na leap at my new offer. You give me the key to bringing down Wonder Breath... and I give you the thing that you crave most... in the entire cosmos : your freedom. You should have been there, Father. I mangled the Minotaur... grappled with the Gorgon. Just like Phil told me. I analysed the situation... controlled my strength and kicked. The crowds went wild! - Thank you. Thank you. - Hah! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man proud. I 'm glad to hear you say that, Father. I 've been waiting for this day a long time. Hmm. What day is that, son? The day I rejoin the gods. You 've done wonderfully. You really have, my boy. You 're just not there yet. You have n't proven yourself a true hero. But, Father, I 've beaten every single monster I 've come up against.
