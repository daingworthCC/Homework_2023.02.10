5228041 That 's very good. Well, that 's very nice. No, it is n't. I just ca n't get it right. You think the wings are too big? Oh, no, not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And you should n't worry about making it look perfect. But Mrs. Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as realistic as possible. Well, she 's right. It is important that you be able to make the clay take the shape you want it to have but you 're not supposed to be concentrating on technique today. I 'm here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance what do you think about when you see a bird? Flying? Fine. So make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. How 's it going, Data? I have finished. The dimensions are accurate to within 1.3%%%. I 'm sure they are. Data, you obviously do n't have a problem with realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe you should try something a little more... abstract. Here... I want you to start a new piece. I 'd like you to sculpt... music. Counselor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can I reproduce a sound with clay? Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people. The images that music brings to your mind. And then, give it a form. It 's a start. Riker to Data, please report to the Bridge. Acknowledged, sir. On my way. Captain 's Log, Stardate 47615.2. We have encountered a rogue comet in Sector 1156. It is not native to this region of space and there is no previous record of this object on any Federation charts. Based on its present trajectory the comet appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. That 's over two sectors away. That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for 87 million years. That 's a long time alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Data and log the findings with the Federation Astrophysical Survey. Aye, sir. The comet 's outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core consists of heavier elements. What was that? There is a distortion within the comet 's inner core. I believe we experienced an intense sensor echo. Can you correct for it? I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for the effect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We are still picking up some interference but the distortion is manageable. At these settings, the scan will be complete in 39 hours. Worf says he 's going to teach us some Mok'bara throwing techniques today. More like falling techniques. Last time we did that, I was sore for a week. What 's this? I have no idea. I 've never seen it before. Maybe Will left it for you... a little present. It 's not quite his style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... that 's an interesting thought. Well, you 'll figure it out later. Come on, we 're going to be late. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before. That 's nice. Data... this is amazing. How did you come up with this? I followed your advice, Counselor. I used my imagination. That 's an understatement. For some reason, as I was shaping the clay the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quite naturally. Data, have you been in my quarters? No, Counselor. Someone left an object in my room. Some kind of artifact. And it has something very similar to this. And you do n't know anything about it? I do not. Excuse me, Counselor. Can you help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we should investigate this matter further. These symbols do n't match anything in the Federation linguistics banks. Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our computer core. I do n't know how it 's working but it 's reconfiguring our systems. How did it get in? I was able to trace its path from the replicators to the sensor array. The sensors? They 've been scanning that comet for the past 18 hours. Those energy readings from the comet 's core... that sensor echo... we still do n't know what 's inside that thing. Maybe it 's about time we find out. Could we use the phasers to melt down the shell of the comet? Yes, a dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick. And it would n't take long to come up with the firing parameters. What do you think, Data? Data... what 's wrong? I believe I recognize these symbols. How? I do not know. You think maybe your systems have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe my systems are currently impaired but I will run a full diagnostic to make certain. What do you think they mean? Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger. What 's that one? Death. Captain, phasers are set for wide dispersal. Ten percent maximum power. The beam will automatically terminate once the comet 's core is reached. Very well, Mr. Worf. Fire. Phasers have terminated. Mr. Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over 87 million years old. That 's older than the comet itself. Could someone from the D'Arsay system have built it? There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now, but perhaps... 87 million years ago, there were. Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet? Possibly... it accumulated those frozen gasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case it 's definitely responsible for the system anomalies we 've been experiencing. They 're using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and replicators. But the question remains, why? What is its purpose? Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive. Why do you say that, Mr. Data? I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function. Data, the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex. And it 's got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a database of some kind but it could be practically anything. I do n't see how you can know for sure what it is. Data, do you believe that you 're in communication with that object? It is a possibility, sir. I recommend we run a level-1 diagnostic of my positronic net to determine if that is the case. Very well. - Mr. La Forge, give him a hand. - Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with us? Yes, it 's possible, but if that is an archive from some ancient civilization, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful. Mr. Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors? If the ship is in any danger I want you to sever the connection immediately. Aye, sir. Come. Captain? Yes, come in, Number One. We 've confined the system corruption. It wo n't be spreading any further. But we still have alien symbols floating around in our computer. This is quite a collection you 've assembled. I 've seen these things all over the ship. They all look the same... primitive and nonfunctional. Ah, ceremonial. And deceptively primitive. Only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there. These artifacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled across some sort of alien library? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a find of the most enormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much more than simply store information. Who knows what we might not learn from this? I keep seeing this design. Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. What do you think it means? Well, the concept of the four cardinal compass directions are quite common in many different cultures. The words that Data recognized in the computer... boundary, border, road... they were all arranged in this design. Well, perhaps the artifacts that all have this compass symbol belong to the same theme... movement finding a direction, traveling a path crossing a boundary. And death? One of the symbols was death. Well, the ultimate boundary. I 've seen this symbol everywhere, too but much less prominently displayed. It 's always in the background... much smaller than the others. What do you think it represents? I have no idea. Lower synaptic functions are completely normal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my memory subsystem next. All right. Data, what 's wrong? I am not certain. I am experiencing a... curious sensation. Well... what is it? An impulse. Impulse? What kind of impulse? I... do not know. I 'm going to check out your higher functions. Geordi. What... does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? Data, come on, you 're scaring me. Now, what 's going on? I do not know. I... am different. Well, you 're going to be all right. You 're with me, okay? Okay. Listen, I 'm going to disconnect you. What 's going on? Data... Masaka is waking. Captain... Captain! I 've been waiting for you. You should feel honored. I do n't usually wait for anyone. What is it you want? Masaka is waking. Are you Masaka? I am not Masaka! I am lhat. What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the one who was here. Yes. He 's gone. Who can say where? Picard to Counselor Troi. Report to Main Engineering immediately. Picard to Counselor Troi. Report to Main Engineering immediately. Lhat, this place you come from is it a cultural archive of your species? I come from Masaka 's city. Are there others like you there? There are no others like me. Who is Masaka? You will find out. I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds you. It can be done. I did it. Masaka. I am yours. Every part of me is yours. We should confine him to quarters. This is a micrograph of what 's happened to Data 's positronic net. Now, as near as I can tell, these are behavioral nodes. I 've counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data to create different people within its culture much in the same way it used our replicators to create artifacts. As a result, Data 's real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. The archive has n't stopped yet. Data 's positronic net is still being transformed. There 's no telling how many more personalities might emerge. Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive and see if you can find some way to access it and in the meantime I 'll see what I can learn from these... people inside Data. I 'm not going to hurt you. Only Masaka can hurt me. I am for her... alone. I need to speak with lhat. Do you understand? Lhat. Captain. That was a cruel joke you played on me. For a moment... a brief moment... I actually thought that woman was Masaka. Whoever took your place was n't afraid of Masaka. He seemed eager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't catch me humiliating myself for a woman, even if she were a queen. Then Masaka is your queen. She 's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time sleeping. Problem is what she does when she 's awake. Then we should try to keep her asleep? Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky, hmm? Uh-uh. Only Korgano can do that and he 's not here. Where is he? Help me. Please. What 's wrong? I 'm afraid. Of what? Her. Masaka? Her! Picard to Bridge. Report. The archive just activated some sort of tractor beam, sir. We 're not able to disengage it. Has there been any damage to the ship? There was an emergency reported in Ten-Forward. Mr. Worf 's on his way. Captain, there 's some kind of energy pulse coming through the tractor beam. It 's overriding our control systems. I 'll be right there. Do n't leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. Does it hurt? Yes. She 's going to hurt us all. Now you 've done it, Captain. Masaka is awake. Who 's this? I 'd say that that is Masaka. He had referred to her as " queen " and it 's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolized by a sun. You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, even terrified? Well, according to Data the sun image is also a symbol for death. See, there it is again... the same u-shaped symbol small and insignificant almost as if it 's an afterthought. Captain, this is incredible. These artifacts were n't beamed here from the archives. The matter here in Ten-Forward has been transformed. Into living plants? How is that possible? I 'm not sure, but bit by bit, this ship is being transformed. We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship. Part of deck 12 is now an aqueduct. What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to find out. I do n't think we have any choice. We must destroy that archive, Mr. Worf. Sir, our weapons control systems are inoperative. However, we could reconfigure a photon torpedo for manual launch. Make it so. There 's so much more here that we could have learned. I really regret losing that opportunity. Okay, I 've locked in the targeting parameters. What 's the phase alignment now? Less than.7%%%. Good, that 'll do it. I 'm setting the yield at maximum. Sir, the onboard power systems are not functioning. Let 's see what 's going on here. Whoa! Something tells me we 'd better get out of here. Engineering to Bridge. Emergency transport. Two to beam out. Maybe we 'd better talk out here. The observation lounge has turned into a swamp. So... what 's our status? Well, so far the archive has transformed about 20% of the ship. We 've lost main propulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication? Sensors? Life-support? We have communications and limited sensor control. Life-support seems to be unaffected. I 've analyzed the alien plant forms. They 've developed from biological matter we have on the ship. The stone, the artifacts are made in much the same way... extrapolating from the ship 's own alloys. Apparently, the archive can reorder and transform molecular structure... including DNA... into anything it wants. So it 's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA to create elements of its own culture. But why is this happening? What does the archive hope to accomplish? Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process I 'm not going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mr. La Forge, do you have any ideas? Well, we still have n't been able to cut off that beam but I have managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along their signal path. If I could locate the transformation program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea but I feel that the answer lies there... with Masaka. We must find her... access her. Hello. Difficult... to stay warm. It 's not warm enough... not for an old man. Tell me about Masaka. My... daughter. Tell me how can I talk to her. Children... grow... forget their parents... No... Only Korgano can talk to Masaka. Korgano. Who is that? Well, are n't we the persistent one? Lhat? Is anyone else so charming? Masaka is taking over my ship. I told you she would. I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is the only one who can do that. Who told you that? An old man. Masaka 's father. Oh, yes. Yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his bones to make the world. Any wonder he does n't like to talk about her? How can I find Korgano? I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gone? Stop asking me these questions. I was fast enough to get away from her once. I do n't want her to find me again. I 'll wind up on her sacrificial slab. Lhat, if she 's looking for a sacrifice she can take me. Perhaps then she 'll stop looking for you. Well, there 's an idea. Better you than me. Very well. What do we do? You must build Masaka 's temple. The Queen 's temple. That will get her attention. Very well. How do I do that? You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old man. But just try getting it out of him. Give me the sign. If she finds out... you ca n't imagine her rage. She lets people... die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes, she burns them alive. She is glorious. Lhat, the sign. Give it to me. If she comes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the unending horizon. A curve as... She has found me. Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. It seems... I was not fast enough. So hard... to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I ca n't remember anymore. I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka 's temple. It wo n't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he can stop her. A line as the unending horizon. A curve as... A line, as the unending horizon. A curve... As... the rolling hillside. A point... as a distant bird. A ray... as the rising sun. Thank you. Now... come sit with me. Tend the fire. I 'm alone. No one left to help me. She 's coming. Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? No. She sent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any progress, Mr. La Forge? I think I 've found the archive 's transformation program. Will it accept the symbol for Masaka 's temple? I think so. I 've isolated the program 's input pathways... their key to accept symbols. If I input this one it should initiate the transformation program. And create the temple? Well, I hope so. If this is the wrong symbol it might turn the Enterprise into a big chunk of rock. No way to know for sure. The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archive that seems bent on taking us over? Lhat risked his life to show me that symbol. And Masaka killed him for doing it. I think we have to risk it. Captain, the entire deck has been cleared of personnel. We may proceed. Commander Riker, we 're ready. Understood. Initiate transformation. Inputting the symbol now. It would seem that this is Masaka 's temple. There is no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it would get her attention. It may be some time before she shows herself. How will she do that? I do n't know. Captain? Take a look at this. This is the first time I 've seen these two symbols paired. That could be significant. Look, there it is again. And again. And there, again. This is obviously an important pairing. He is n't chasing her anymore. Sir? Lhat said that someone called Korgano is n't chasing Masaka anymore. And the old man said, " he pursues her no longer. " In a sense, the small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka. The symbol suggests antlers of some kind, uh, horns. Maybe it is meant to represent an animal? Animals are worshipped in many cultures. That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Lhat and the old man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their belief systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful godlike figure. It 's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart a consort. Look around. See if you can see that horn-like symbol anywhere else. This is the most prominent instance of the horn symbol we 've seen yet. But now it appears as though Masaka 's sun is chasing it. The sun chasing an animal? Maybe it 's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is more like... the sun and the moon. I see. Masaka and Korgano switching positions. The sun setting, and the moon rising. Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in a continual cycle. And like the sun and the moon only one of them can be in ascendance at any given time. If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out then perhaps he could force Masaka to leave. But would we be better off with him? Hmm. Lhat and the others did n't seem to be frightened of Korgano. Sir? Masaka. Masaka, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away! Please hear us. Your archive is destroying... I do not hear you! She will not even listen to us. Then we will have to find someone to whom she will listen. I found it, Captain. This is the only place in the archive where Korgano 's moon symbol appears by itself, not linked with Masaka 's. All right, Mr. La Forge I want you to access the transformation program and, when you 're ready, input the symbol. Is n't that a little risky? We have no idea what the result would be. The symbol might generate anything from Korgano 's temple to Korgano himself. In one sense, Korgano is Masaka 's nemesis. And whatever this symbol represents it could be, for us, a means to control her. Now, if anyone has a better idea I 'm very happy to entertain it. I 've accessed the program, Captain. Initiate the transformation. Another mask. You know, we could be going about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritualistic culture one based on symbol and myth. Perhaps we should try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehow incorporate myself in their ritual then perhaps Masaka would listen to me. You 're going to try to pose as Korgano? Captain, we know so little about this culture and even less about Korgano. How would you convince Masaka that you 're him? Well, I 'm really not certain but there are similarities between this culture and others that I 've studied. I would imagine I 'm just going to improvise. Mr. Worf, what 's our status? I estimate we have less than two hours before there is nothing left of the ship at least nothing we can recognize. Masaka? Korgano. Are you surprised to see me? I thought I had escaped you. You should know that is impossible. You are a fine hunter, but I am a powerful prey. You will never catch me. Do you want to be the prey forever? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share the sky with you. But without me, you are not complete. I know you so well. You live for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter? Pursuing me? Forcing me from the sky, so that you can rise again? You know me well, Korgano. I think... that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult brightening the sky forever. Hmm. I am getting sleepy. You always do that to me. So that you can wake with the dawn. And begin the hunt again. Let the hunt begin again. I am eager for that. As am I. Riker to Picard. I do n't know what you did, sir but it looks like everything 's back to normal. Acknowledged. Mr. Data, you all right? I believe so, sir. I am not entirely certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again? I 'm afraid that will take some time to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forge has managed to disable the alien transformation program. Starfleet has dispatched an archeological team to study the archive further. But I do n't understand. I thought all of the alien artifacts had disappeared from the Enterprise. That one was not created by the archive, sir. That is the clay mask I originally made. I have since painted it. A memento? Yes, sir. Although I am... relieved to be rid of those alien personalities in a sense, I am now... empty. Hmm. I can imagine. Dr. Crusher told me that there were possibly dozens of personalities inside you. I suspect the number was much greater. My impression is that there were thousands of all ages and walks of life. It was a remarkable experience. Well, Data, you never may become fully human but you 've had an experience that transcends the human condition.
