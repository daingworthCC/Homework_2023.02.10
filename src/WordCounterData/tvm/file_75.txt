5224141 Dude... We got ta get outta here! I ca n't, they got me pinned down... Let 's go! I got you Go! What the hell happened to you? Walked myself into an armed robbery. Shoot anybody? Nah - they both got away. Well, that 's too bad. Yes You look OK Yes. I 'm good... Fine. This is er... Ty Curtis. Yeah. I 've seen you around the station. I transferred in three weeks ago. You were first on the scene? Yeah, I was around the corner. They had me pinned down, Fry guys were cold blood. Seemed like they were gunning for me. Were n't for Ty... I 'd be dead. Good job. Thank you, sir. They all done with you here? Yes. Let 's go get a drink. Thanks, man. Ca n't stay out of trouble, can you? I was hungry. Came a little close with some of those shots, huh? Had to make it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did? Like a ticket to his favourite show, brother. What about Fry? He showed up right after you and Carter. All he had to do was shoot up a liquor store. I would have done it weeks ago if I knew that 's what it would take. Man, Fry runs a tight unit - you should see the way they treat him, down at the station house... Like he walks on water. He does n't! I promise you that. Fry give you anything else? Told me to hand in a report. Good - use that. Make sure you cover Fry 's man. You mean Chavez. Yeah, so the report makes him look good. It 'll show Fry you 're not afraid to get a little dirty. I 'll try... Carter, you do n't feel bad about... Investigating other cops? The whole " blue wall " brotherhood of cops? Exactly how long have you been investigating Fry? I moved Ty to Metro Division as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fry is one of the most highly decorated officers on the force. John Doe? Name 's Osiri. He was one of my informants, an old one... He told me about a con named Terry Isaiah manufactures and sells meth and ecstasy. Rumour has it that his operation ran untouched, because he had a cop in his pocket. Fry. I see. So now we 're takin ' the word of criminals over cops? Four days after I talked to him... Osiri was killed in a drug raid led by Fry 's task force. Thing is - Osiri did n't sell drugs. Do you know how many times Fry 's been investigated by IAD? And every time they get nothing. Have you, uh, seen his arrest record? I need you to transfer someone out of Fry 's task force, to make room for Ty. You know they 're promoting Fry to captain. God, how good you look in uniform! I thought you married me because of my charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much longer you got on this one, babe? Well, hopefully, not much longer, babe, we might not even have a case, here. Too bad, because I kinda like these cases... You get to stay home... Predictable hours... I 'm just saying, you might wan na be a little careful now that I 'm... I 'm pregnant. Did I hear you right? Did you say... You 're pregnant? Yeah? - Oh, well... do n't get too excited, because... I did two of those home pregnancy tests, and one came out positive one came out negative. - And you could n't go for a tie-breaker? No, I 'm not gon na know anything for sure until I get in to see the doctor. I got ta get in the shower. Ok. Relax. This is n't the Marines. I was telling Fry how impressive you were in the shooting. Chavez told me you were, like, Wyatt Earp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more impressed by your report. Like when you said the shooters turned on Chavez without provocation. Well, er... How would you know that... If you came in after the shooting started? Not in the habit of making pricks who shoot at me sympathetic, sir. I looked into your record... Says they posted you from the academy for a special assignment. Yes sir, it was an undercover case. With all due respect, the lead detective was an idiot - almost got me killed. That why you 're still a uni? I 'm still in uni, sir, because I punched the fool in the face. Stuck me Devonshire division, it took me eight months to transfer back into Metro. One of the men of my Task Force got transferred out... That leaves me with a slot open... That any uni in the division would give his left nut to fill. We need guys who can get it done... We have one of the highest rates of conviction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you can have any assignment you want. Leave the mortician outfit home, tomorrow. You go in soft clothes. Let 's see what you got. Congrats, bro '. You just got yourself a trial... It 's the bad-ass 'd unit in the department. These are all the arrest reports for Fry 's task force. They 're busy. Yeah, and the one name you never see in any of these reports? Terry Isaiah. So he 's flying under the radar. Or someone turns the radar off. Isaiah 's a big player, deals in ecstasy and meth... You break down Fry 's arrests - everyone of Isaiah 's competitors were either arrested, or wound up dead... There ' a pattern here - like Fry 's in Isaiah 's pocket. What I still do n't understand is, why... Ran a financial check on Fry. Nothing seems unusual. So we take Isaiah... Get him to flip on Fry? Too risky. If Isaiah does n't flip, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug-dealer 's word against a big-time cop... We need to catch Fry in the act. Put pressure on Isaiah 's operation, force him to use Fry... Then we catch Fry capering for Isaiah... And bam! We got ' I'm. We 're gon na need some help... I do not know, Carter. That man has more love than Gandhi, down there... Nobody from Metro 's gon na help us. What makes you think I 'd go to cops for help? Take a walk! Police! Easy... Easy! Carter, you gon na get yourself killed, rolling up in here like that. Would you 've answered if I knocked? No. These two woulda smoked you. Yeah. What 's up, Carter? - Chill out. - It 's OK. So, if you 're lookin ' for a new ride, these are n't for sale. These are... part of my private collection. I need help with something. I told you long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do n't need information. I need help busting someone. A cop. Lieutenant. They teach you any other languages out there in the Devonshire division? Can you read that? That 's better than the L.A. Times. You 're standing in the most heavily contested gang ' hood in the city See those names? You know what they mean? " 187. " Hit list. People the gang 's targeted for murder. that's right. What are those numbers? If you earn a spot up there... That means you 're doing something right. Let 's go to work... I 'll ride with you. You ever been here before? No. I did n't even know Carter had a house. Do n't you think it 's a little strange that we 're only seeing it when he 's entertaining criminals? You got it? It 's printing. D' you think it was a good idea, bringing these guys home? Well, I was n't gon na bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty cop Isaiah has? Lieutenant Jay Fry... We 're hearing Isaiah uses him to come up with his own private police. Any time something or someone threatens his business... We think he puts Fry on it. So we need to disrupt that business. You find out anything? Isaiah 's got a lab, up in the canyon. Ok, what kind of security are we talking about, here? Anywhere from six to eight guys... And they come heavy. That 's why I need your help... The three of us ca n't cover them all. Gon na need full benefits. Fine. Good. When we gon na do this? Oh, baby, sorry I 'm late. Been busy? Uhm, yeah. Say, we got a, er... We got a, er... Got a tip about a stash house, right...? We took it down... Took in some major weight... I got ta say, babe, working with these guys, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you had a good time. And then... It felt kinda good, not havin ' to sneak around, you know? I actually felt... Proud to make the bust. You get to the doctor? Thing is, the doctor 's out of town for the next few days. And I... I do n't know... A part of me is really enjoying the idea of being pregnant, Even if I 'm not. Can you imagine? Do we even have room in this house? Babe, they 're like the size of a football, are n't they? Well we 'll figure it out. Remember what we agreed on? Yes, I remember. Lieutenant. Am I, uh, interrupting anything? No, no. Come on in. Melissa... Lieutenant Fry... Lieutenant Fry, this is my wife. Melissa. - How do you do. - Hi. People just call me Fry. You have a lovely house. Thank you. Um... Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you. Your, uh... Your husband showed some, uh... Real smarts, today. We 're gon na make him a serious crime fighter. Well just as long as you keep him safe. Oh, I will. My wife and I are having a little get-together, tomorrow... It 's, er, wives, kids... You two should come by, meet the family. Sounds great. Why do n't I let you two guys talk... It was so nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. House. Wife. Nice job, Curtis. I 'm very lucky, sir. I 'll see you tomorrow. Okay. And, lieutenant, thank you for coming by. Oh! If it is n't T.J. Hooker. What 's goin ' on? We 're raiding Isaiah 's place. Is it a rip? No. For closure. You want me in on this? No, I ca n't risk you getting seen. We got everything. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Of course, what 's up? Fry came by my house tonight. - For what? - He invited us to a barbecue. Ok... Wine - it 's always nice to bring ; some cheese... He came to my house. Was he suspicious? I do n't know. So what 's the problem? We were both home, me and Mel. There 's no way we could 've created a cover for you as a different cop... Fry would 've found it - we just altered your real record. But this brings her in the case, now. Ty, I ca n't figure out that part of your life, for you. What does that mean? I doubt anything 's going to happen at a barbecue. So i 'm guessin about seven... Two cooks, five shooters. But it does n't look like Isaiah 's there. Okay, take these two... Go in the back - Neil and I 'll go through the front. I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their way. No. You 're not in charge. No collateral in this... This is n't a hit. Carter, we 're not cops. We will do what we have to... Just do n't do it for fun. We 're in position. Stay down! Now! Get down, now! No, no, no, you stay right there! Cover! Cover! No! On the ground, now! Okay, let 's go... Go! You know whose house this is? Terry Isaiah! At least we got the right address, huh? All good. Ok. We 're done. Oh, and, uh... You have a lovely house. You 're dead. That 's a fact. Isaiah 's gon na kill you... Kill your family... Kill anyone you care about. That was fun. Yeah. Am I the only one who thinks last night was surreal? Sometimes we work with questionable people, you know? No, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's with them. Does n't that seem strange to you? Not really. They are who they are, you know? Not pretend to be something they 're not. Kinda makes sense. Another a shot at me? What? Because of Scott - and you. You have to stop thinking everything 's about that, okay? Dean, I need you to back-up Ty. - It 's a barbecue. - I know. Just go, Please. Who were those guys last night? - Just some people I know. - Dean says they stole money from Isaiah. We crippled a major drug operation, it 's a bargain at twice the price. You 're early. What? I 'm right on time. You used to like ' em skinny, Carter. What 'd you just say? She 's working with me. The latest victim, uh? Hey, do n't listen to this maniac, he 's gon na get you killed. Hey, will they get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... And that other thing you were asking about? Yeah, what d' you know? There 's a guy I know. Deals to all the clubs and bars. Usually buys from Isaiah. That 's perfect, Mott - thanks. You sure this is cool? It 's cool... As long as you get most of it back to me by next week. - Got a big buyer. - No problem. Everything else good? The kid? Doing better. Thanks. Do you know any normal people? What do you mean? What are we doing with that? Going into business. I 'm a little nervous. No need to be, baby, just be yourself. These guys are just cops, and you know what? I do n't even know if they 're bad cops. I think I get it. What? Why you like your job. It 's quite exciting. - Hey! You made it! Lieutenant... Thank you for the invite. - Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - How are you? - Good, thank you. - Brought you some Chardonnay. Chardonnay, beautiful, I 'll go find some ice for this. - Hey, ***** Chavez? - How you doing? I 'm good... Melissa, my wife. - Hey, nice to met you - Michael Chavez. - Hi. - This is my wife, Theresa. - Hi! And this... This is my little boy... - Evan. - Oh, my God! How old is he? About 18 months. High five! See? See? He 's so precious...! Good looking, like his dad, eh? - Anything? - Yeah, yeah... Ty decided to bring the Chardonnay instead of Chianti. Funny. Is n't really your thing? House, the lawn, barbecues... I tried it once. Did n't stick. I need you with me. Jaimie, you stay here and back-up Ty... We 'll take my car. Oh, my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your custody case? Nothin ' good... I mean, her mother hired some high-priced divorce lawyer... Ca n't afford to fight that. You know, I know a guy... Usually reps the Hollywood crowd, but I got him out of a DUI. He was with a stripper he 'd been bangin ' on the side. He 'll take your case, pro bono. There you go! Fry, man... - Thanks. - No problem. Can I talk to you a second? Sure. His wife could n't handle the hours he was pulling... And she wants sole custody. Damn. How long you been married? Five months. Yeah, I know, I 'm a rookie. You? Seventeen years. Wow. That 's Jackie, there... The blonde. I like working with married guys. Why 's that? Well, when you got something to come home to... Makes you think real hard about what you 're doing out there. Married guys make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Could n't agree more. So, what are we talking about here? I 'm talking about a partnership, man. I know you 're wired into all the clubs. From what I hear you got a really tasty customer base. I want to tap into it. I got a regular supplier. And he does not like competition. Talking about Terry Isaiah, right? You 've heard of him, and you still tryin ' to cut into his business? You 're either dumb or crazy. Isaiah 's about to run out of product, bro '. And why 's that? Lab in Topanga got hit last night - blasted up. Yeah, so unless you start filing for the winter... Your customers ' gon na need a new dealer. How do you know all this? Because we 're the ones who did it. Check with Isaiah, man... He 's gon na tell you he 's fresh out of product. Unlike us. That 's a freebie, man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. Right? I do n't know anything about this... But even if I did, I do n't care... I do n't care... No No... Not my problem, I told you that, last time. Everything okay? Yeah... Yeah. Uh... Get everyone together, I just got a tip about a new supplier... That maybe setting up shop, here. Get your hands up! Whoa, man... Whoa... - Hey, what is this, man? - Put your hands up! What 's happenin '? What is this? Tumi... When the hell are you gon na get a job? Anybody got a warrant? I 'm hearing you 're buying from a new supplier, is that true? Who 's gon na pay for my door? Focus, Tumi. Maybe I heard of a couple of white dudes... - Selling door to door. - Tumi, names. And if I give you that, then you and me all good? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Do n't hassle me. Then do n't act like supercops... I know Isaiah 's pulling your string. Probably how you heard about this, right here. I ca n't believe you could be this stupid. Toss it! The whole place! - Gun! - No! Hold your fire! He 's dead. What are you doing? He had a gun. It was a remote. Looked... Looked like a... Gun. Noyce. Wait a minute. Wait. It 's done. Call it in. To one les scumbag on earth, huh? DA 's office call you yet? Spoke to a( shield and team?) rep It all happened so fast. You did the right thing. He waited until I turned my back, and then he drew his gun to kill me. But it was n't a gun. I saw a gun. Plain as day. No question. Yep. Tumi was a degenerate. Sold drugs to kids. Nobody at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this. Just tell ' em what happened. And you got four, other, decorated officers... That 'll swear under oath to it. You 're thinking too hard about it, man... You did the right thing. Who is Isaiah? Tumi said someone named Isaiah was pulling your strings, who is he? Damn, Ty... You do n't miss a thing, do you? Isaiah, as in Terry Isaiah... A big-time supplier... Meth... Ecs... So you do know him? Yeah, he 's an informant of mine. So you go after a dude like Tumi, but you let a supplier like Isaiah operate? Isaiah feeds me information. He 's more valuable to me on the streets than he is in jail... And as soon as that changes, well, uh... We 'll blow him out too. So why did Tumi say Isaiah was pulling your strings? You got ta give these fools their pride... I let ' em think they 're calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes... They answer to us. And who do we answer to? Nobody. Ever. You want to be a legit. cop...? You want to be a real, bona fide crimefighter...? This is what it takes. And do n't ever hang your head down low. The hell have you been? I had to get my head straight, somehow. I heard. You shot Tumi? - The hell were you doing? - Oh, it 's like that? What do you want a hug? I didn? t ' put you out there to kill people. Yeah, well, you know, it 's a little different when the bad guys know that you 're a good guy. Did Tumi at least give up that we 're the new suppliers? - I do n't know, I 'm not sure. - Not good enough! I need you to catch Fry working for Isaiah, you understand that? What if you 're wrong about Fry and Isaiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant. - It makes sense! - Tell me you 're not starting to fall for Fry 's bullshit. - Tell me! - What is it with you and this guy, huh? Fry does n't do any thing that we do n't. What did you say? He 's a cop, Carter, just like us. - What did you say? - He 's a cop... Just... Like... Us! He 's nothing like us! - Alright! - Get that straight! It 's always good to show your feelings, please, vent a little bit. Come on, let 's go - we 're out of here. You 've been drinking. Went out with Fry and the guys. Long day. You alright? Yeah. You have fun at the barbecue the other day? I must admit, I did. I mean, since you 've been working for Carter, we have n't... exactly hung out with other cop families, so... it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. Working with these guys, you see there 's different ways of doing the job. Come here. Hey, Ty. You file your shooting report, yet? I was about to, why? Chavez, if you got something to say, say it, man. Fry 's trying to make you think it was a dirty shoot, but it was n't... I had a clear line of sight at Tumi. When Fry leaned down, he planted the gun... After you shot him, he leaned back down to check his pulse... Suddenly the gun became a remote control. What the hell are you saying to me? It 's what he does, man. He ropes you in. It 's how he wins your loyalty. Did something like that to me. Always had my doubts. But by then, its... On your record. If you come out now... You end your career. What do you know about Terry Isaiah? Isaiah, what? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off to Tumi... and these new drug suppliers, right? What I 'm asking, is Isaiah really Fry 's informant? Rumour is Isaiah has something on Fry. Way back when, Fry sold his badge out to Isaiah for a few deals. What Fry did n't know... was that Isaiah recorded everything. Well, you can go to IAD? - I 'm no rat. - So why you telling me this? Your wife told my wife... You 're trying to have a baby. Trust me, man.. Everything changes after that. What 's going on? Nothing, captain, Chavez was in here trying to convince me... that your sex life does n't change after you have kids. I ai n't convinced, Chavez. We traced a number found at Tumi 's. It sounds like that new supplier we 've been hearing about... This guy 's a real piece of work... Armed robbery, home invasions... We 're hitting him now. - I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are we? Nothing from Ty. You know Fry, do n't you? We worked together on a task force, years ago. It was a different time. Different department. We... Were encouraged to do questionable things. Fry was the worst. A straight up fuck. How is he still on the force? When things got out of hand, and the DA 's indictments started coming down... Everyone stuck to the " honour among cops " code... Except Fry. Everyone was sure he 'd... cut some kind of deal to save his own ass. What happened to you? Let 's just say I was n't on the Chief 's Christmas card list. So Fry gets a wife, A white picket fence, promotion... And get to be buddies with criminals. Not quite. Where 's Dean? At home, why? Fry 's on his way there, right now! Alright, let 's be smart. Do n't take any chances. Especially after Tumi. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Let 's go. You stay here, cover the front. What the hell happened? Crazy son of a bitch just started shooting. He got away. This is 2-Zebra-12, we 've an officer down, repeat, officer down! 1400 block of Lanterman Drive. Is he dead? Alright... He 's a convicted drug dealer... Relatively new in town, so check with your contacts in the community... Work with your sister agencies. And I 've been asked to pass on a message from the Chief. He understands emotions are running high... But proper procedure is gon na make this case. The way I see it... They have their department 's procedure... And we have our code. Chavez was our brother. And that 's why we need to bag this cop-killing scumbag, ourselves. In cuffs, if you have to... In a body bag, if you can. Did you see them shoot Chavez? I barely made it out of there when they bust in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Said she was thinking about leaving Fry 's unit. He was gon na flip? No, but Fry must have found out he was thinking about leaving... And he probably got spooked that Chavez was having second thoughts. He 's trying to tie up loose ends, before he gets promoted. First Tumi, now Chavez. So, maybe I can make an approach, cut a deal with Fry. Fry 's made you into a cop-killer, do n't you get that? Every cop in the city 's gon na be gunning for you. They 'll shoot you on plain sight... And get a medal for it. Fry 's played this perfectly. Damn it! I have to clean this up with Maynard. Ty, why do n't you go home and get some rest? No. I want Fry! But how, T? We do n't even know what 's his endgame is. The drugs in your apartment. Fry recovered ' em... But when I checked, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them... Can I talk to you? Go ahead. Well, Chavez, sir. Before the shooting, he told me he was having second thoughts about this unit. Second thoughts? He thought what you were doing was dirty. I think he was flirting... With IAD. Why would he tell you that? Since I 'm the new guy... Said he wanted me to know what I was getting into. Well... What do you think you 're getting into? A unit that gets results. I know Chavez was your boy, and what happened was a tragedy. But if you ask me, you got a lucky break... And the unit 's better off without him. I 'm going to... Let you in on a little something. Word 's come down from up high... They 're making me a captain. I 'm gon na have my own division. You, Noyce... Kim. We 're going to run it the old way. The right way. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... One last thing we need to do. Deal with Terry Isaiah. You did n't do what I said, Fry. Are... Are you getting deaf with age? ' Cause I said I want that punk-ass dead for blasting my lab. Every cop in the city is hunting him down. He 's as good as dead. That does n't make me feel any better. What the hell 's this? Ah, call it restitution. To hold you over, Until you get another lab. set up and running. What the hell 's going on? Carter. You always were a sneaky son of a bitch. It 's over, Jay. You called the cops? On me? You murdered a cop. You mean... He murdered a cop. As far as the world knows... He 's a cop-killer. And you... You 're an LAPD cautionary tale. Just a buncha... Cops gone bad in the pocket of a drug dealer. If you kill all of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their guns down. You first. Wait! I can fix this! - Wait! - I ca n't, Fry. I can fix it! Put it down. Do n't think you 're any better than me. Ty. Back off. You OK? Cell phone was off. Yeah... Must be the battery. Well, look, Mel wanted me to invite you to dinner. She thought you and I could use some hang-out time. I told her you probably had a big date... Big night lined up... But I told her I 'd ask, anyway. You know me too well. So I 'll tell her, maybe next time. Yeah. Next time. Cool. Listen, for a minute there, Mel thought she was pregnant. When we got married, I said told her if we ever had a baby, then I 'd stop going under with you. Well, you do... What you need to do. Goodnight, man.
