Vijah, I already asked you once with my mouth. Now. Chop chop. Yeah. She is a good one. I bet you would love to fuck that right in half. Hmm? Oh. I 'm sorry, I... I should n't be speaking like that. Disgusting behavior, I know. I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always told me when I was a little boy to keep my mouth shut. They told me if I did n't watch my language they would put some soap in my mouth and wash all those curse words away. Well. One time they actually did. My mother dragged me into the bathroom and made me eat a half a bar of soap. I threw up so much that night, I started to throw up blood. Must 've had some sort of chemical reaction from the soap.( @inhales_deeply)( MOANS) But did my parents take me to the hospital? No. It was too much of an inconvenience for them to take care of their sick, first born son. So later that night when I was feeling a little better and my parents had gone to sleep I decided to go into the kitchen and grab the biggest fucking carving knife I could possibly find then, tip toe into their bedroom and turn them into puzzle pieces. My point is, Miles you fuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll disembowel the next generation of your family.( LAUGHING)( LAUGHING) Now why did you two come into my town and start fucking up my system? We had a nice living situation going on here until you and your fuck hole brother came in rolling around, acting like tough guys. Hmm?

I 'll shove your little fucking face in the ground! You better watch it! You better watch it or I 'll kill your ass!( GRUNTS) I 'll kill your fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!( GRUNTS) Watch that mouth of yours, V. Or I 'll cut it right the fuck off. Sit the fuck down! DOYLE : Vijah? Where are you going? Yeah. You too good for us now, huh? Show 's not even over yet. Show 's not even over yet, bitch! You better not be going to see that piece of shit. - I 'm gon na go to my room. Is that okay? - No! It 's not okay! Sit back down and finish the show! I was n't talking to you. Doyle?( SASHASCREAMS) Bitch!( PANTING)( WHIMPERS)( DOORUNLOCKS)( PANTING)( LIGHTERFLICKS) You look like shit, boy. Not gon na speak, huh? I guess your brother wo n't be either.

You 're gon na be meeting the whole family soon and then your balls will rise right back up in your ass where they belong, boy. So do n't be getting too full now. The main course has yet to come. Oh by the way you got your brother all over your face.( CHUCKLING)( SCREAMING) What 's wrong? Nothing. You seem to be taking a liking to this young man. Is that true? He 's not like you people. Us people? We took you in, Vijah. You 'd be an ink spot on a fucking windshield if it was n't for us. You took me in? That 's one way to put it. Well, your parents were n't doing you any good from what I could see. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And I want you to respect that. I 've got something for you. Here. I want you to put it on. Please. I want to see it on you. Can you turn around, please? DOYLE : No. I want you to wear this to the dinner. Vijah you 're a very beautiful woman. And I can tell that you see something in this man, Miles. But I gave him a choice. I did. And he did n't choose you. That 's why what I 'm about to do is only necessary. It 's the only way you 'll be able to learn. I 'm not trying to hurt you. But right now right this moment I 'm going to have to hurt you.( FLESHRIPPING)( @door_opens)( GASPS)( RIPPING) Ah, just in time! Miles, it 's so nice of you to join us. Dig in. Looks like he 's too good for our food. You better eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hump to cook it for us. Be a shame to let it go to waste. Eat it. Maybe he 's a vegetarian. Miles, I understand that our methods are a bit off putting to you, at the moment. I understand that. But believe me when I tell you this... What? You think of us as insane people? Hm, not true. We just see life differently. It 's very simple. That 's all. I 'd like to make a toast. To new comers new flesh. I 'm sorry that it did n't work out the way I wished, Miles. You had to be so stubborn. When you could 've just became one of us. But do n't you worry. The main event has yet to come.( CHUCKLES) To Miles, everyone. Hmm? - To Miles. - To Miles.( SIPPING) Miles!

What the fuck happened? We were just having a nice meal and you guys go ahead and get up and start killing each other. None of this had to happen, Miles. None of this had to happen if you would 've just joined us. Like a good ol ' boy. I loved you. You know that? And you go ahead and you do this. For what? For what?( DOYLEGASPS)( GUNDROPS)
