5262041 And trust. All right, very nice, people. Now that you have clearly mastered the trust exercise, you, you 're ready to act. But the secret to acting is reacting. Did you see that? He reacted. - He did n't think. Did you? - I try not to, sir. And you 're great at it. I want you all living in that mom... I 've got a brother. You 're gon na have to do way better than that. Oh. Hmm... Nice work. You get an A for the day. I 'll take a B if you stop doing that. Everybody listen up. Now we 're going to do the mirror exercise. What one does, the other mirrors. Acting, reacting. Mirror. Now, next week, we are doing scenes from Shakespeare 's great play, Romeo and Juliet. " But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? " It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. " Man, that dude knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want for a partner? - Well, not Oliver. I mean, look at him. I know, he 's always monkeying around. - Exactly, and I need a good grade. - So do I. But if one of us does n't pick him, nobody will. I guess you 're right. So... - You pick him. - Me? No way! Nice mirror. I have a compromise. I pick Henry! No fair! He went to Shakespeare Camp three summers in a row! - Why do you think I picked him? - You know what? I do n't care. This does n't mean I pick Oliver. You pick Oliver? Bold choice! Especially considering you 're going to have to kiss him. I knew I 'd get you! Just kidding! Comeon! You get the limo out front Hottest styles, every shoe, every color Yeah, when you 're famous it can be kind of fun It 's really you but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me Would double as a superstar? You get the best of both worlds Chill it out, take it slow Then you rock out the show You get the best of both worlds Mix it all together And you know that it 's the best of both worlds Oh, Juliet. Oliver, we have been rehearsing for over two hours and we 're still on the first page! It did n't take Shakespeare this long to write the play! Okay, just give me a second to get into character. Why me? Hey, Juliet! Get it? I 'm a fruit fly! Huh, fruit fly? Now you 're a dead fruit fly. Can we just please do this, Oliver, please? Okay. I 'll really try this time. But soft, what light over yonder breaks wind? No! You know what, I 'm just gon na email Mr. Corelli and ask for another partner. Miley, wait. I 'm just nervous, okay? - Nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hey, guess what, done that. At least when I joke around, they 're laughing because I want them to. Come on, Oliver, nobody 's gon na laugh at you. Trust me, this has been going on forever. Four score and... I 'm a fruit fly! Abraham fruit fly! Okay, look, Oliver, everybody gets nervous. When I 'm up there as Hannah Montana, I get nervous, too. - Oh, yeah, right. - No, really. The minute I hear I have to perform, I get a huge knot in my stomach and my heart starts pounding so hard I can hardly move. Guess who 's singing the National Anthem at the Laker game tomorrow night? Yes! Hannah Montana! Rocking the anthem! For the Lakers! But I 'm very nervous, huge knot, do n't know if I can do it. - Nice try. - Okay, so I do n't get nervous. I 'm Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal kid! Wow. Romeo and Juliet. I had to do this scene in speech class. - And you did just fine, did n't you? - Nope. Actually, it was the darkest day of my life. Made it through the first two words then froze up like Aunt Pearl in the outhouse on Christmas morning. - But everything turned out okay? - Only ' cause I started cracking jokes. " What light through yonder window breaks wind? " That one killed them! But that was wrong. Shakespeare is very important and you 'll use it every day of your life. Like fractions. I 'm using them right now. I 'm halfway out the room. Three-quarters and I 'm gone. See? I 'm not the only one who has a problem with Shakespeare. Even your dad got all freaked out. Oliver, but he did n't have me. You 're my friend. And I 'm not gon na let you fall on your face. Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay, technically, that was n't your face. - Hey, Rico. How 's it going? - Great, fine, swell. Now give me my box. Where 's my secret candy box? Where is it? What happened? What did you do? It 's gone! Yeah, along with the enamel on your teeth. Look, your dad called. Your last dental exam was so bad, they 're putting your x-rays up in the lobby to scare the other kids. The man lies! Last time we went to the movies, he put me in a diaper so I could get in for free. I 'm not buying it. This is the same father who gave me 100 bucks to keep this away from you. Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me... Please, settle down, all right? You see what this candy is doing to you? This is for your own good. Fine. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place on this earth where you could put that candy that I 'm not gon na get it. Oh, yeah? Well, what about right here? Give me, give me, give me, no, give me, give me. - And here. - Give me, give me, give me... Hey, Dad, how you doing? What 's for dinner? Hope it 's meatloaf. How was your day? Mine was good. Nice shirt, goes with your hair. What 's for dinner? Did I already ask that? Meatloaf? Jackson, how much candy have you had today? Why would you even ask that? We both know you have a problem when you 've had too much sweets. Let it go. I was eight, it was Easter, I 'd never seen a chocolate bunny before. Big chocolate bunny ears with candy eyes. Whoa! Okay, let me smell your breath. Dang, you smell like the inside of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few dozen pieces of candy. I can stop anytime I want. - Hey, what are you eating? - Nothing! Get off my back, woman! Daddy, I have n't seen him like this since Halloween of ' 99. Oh, I remember. I clocked him at 58 miles an hour in his roller-skates. In a Yoda costume. So, how 's it going with Romeo? Well, you know, I finally got Oliver to take it seriously and guess what? He 's seriously horrible. I just think you guys need to take a break. We 'll go to the Laker game, you 'll sing the anthem, get your mind off of it. I wish. But all I can think about is getting a bad grade and looking stupid, - just because I 'm stuck with Oliver. - Mile, Oliver is... I know, he 's a friend and you do n't bail on friends. - Yeah, Mile, but... - But nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta jump ship before I go down with him. Mile, iceberg right behind you. You said you 'd be there for me. - Oliver, I was just... - Bailing on me? No, I was just thinking about bailing on you. - It 's different! - You said I was the Titanic. Not the ship! The very successful movie! You made like $ 1 billion! Okay, Daddy, we need a new warning signal. Honey, I did everything but baste you with barbeque sauce. I should not feel bad about this. It 's not my fault that Shakespeare makes him nervous. " What light through yonder window breaks? " How tough is that? Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the singing of our National Anthem by teen pop sensation, Hannah Montana. Osay, can_you see by the dawn 's early light through yonder window breaks... Or ramparts... No, rockets. Red glare... Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly! You get it? Jackson, you want some pancakes with that syrup? No thanks. I 'm good. Jumping Jehoshaphat, Son! Next time, do n't waste a plate. - Just drink it from the bottle. - That 's a great idea! Jackson! Whoo! That really worked. Thanks, Dad! - Sweet. - It 's good. Hey, Mr. Stewart, how 's Miley? Well, it 's noon and she 's still holed up in her room, if that tells you anything. Hey, bud. How you doing? Okay. Except I had this awful dream where I forgot the National Anthem in front of thousands of people. That was n't a dream. You could n't play along for like a minute? Oh, sorry, let 's not think about it anymore. Let 's watch some TV. Get your mind off of it. Everyone is talking about Hannah Montana 's massive mistake. Through yonder window breaks... I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bearie the bear? - You could n't do better than that? - I was three! And I 'm not changing his name now, that would just confuse him. - Here you go, Mile. - I 'm too upset to eat. I 'm not. Well, listen, after tonight, when Hannah performs on Top Rockers, nobody 's even gon na remember she screwed up the National Anthem. - What? - Top Rockers. I love that show! Made the call this morning. It 's all set. Daddy, I ca n't perform on Top Rockers, that 's a live show. What if I mess up again? Miley, what 's going on? You 've never had stage fright before. These are very good. What did you do to them? I mean, I have never had people laughing at me before. Mile, that 's not gon na happen again. Actually, I just put in just a splash of vanilla and a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na put this thing behind you, you got ta get back on the horse, just like Uncle Earl. Uncle Earl forgot the words to the National Anthem? No, Uncle Earl fell off a horse. Took four of us to get that fat, old coot back up there. I just do n't wan na get laughed at again. Wow. And that 's exactly how Oliver feels. And you bailed on him. Ironic, is n't it? Just stop your flapping and eat your flapjacks. Mile, everybody gets nervous. But the longer you wait, the tougher it 's gon na get. I guess you 're right. I just got ta do this, do n't I? But what if I forget the words to one of my songs? Or I forget to put my costume on? Then I 'd be singing in my underwear. That 'd be quite a show. Stupid selfish bees! How much honey do you need? Come on, Oliver. Miley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail on her. - Oh, you mean like she did to me? - But she knows how you feel now. Leonardo DiCaprio threw a foam finger at her. Has n't she suffered enough? Let me think. No. Oliver! Oh, here we are in Happy Bunnyland, Tokyo. Oh, no, what 's that? It 's Jack-zilla! Run for your bunny lives! What are you looking at? Jackson, you have to stop. You 're hopping down a bunny trail of no return. You do n't know what you 're talking about. Of course I do. I was like you once. But I 'm a veggie man now. I even worked out this morning. It 's like I have the energy of a 5-year-old again. Great. Tell it to someone who cares. When you 're ready to get that candy monkey off your back, call me. Well, I do n't need any help, all right? I 'm perfectly fine. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, dear! Oh, do n't pick that up, honey, it 's filthy. We 'll get another one. What 's happening to me? Hey, Jackson. Beautiful day for a walk, is n't it? Ladies. With some pretty ladies to go on a walk with. Hey, guys, wait up, I 'll come with you. See, girls? That 's what too much sugar will do to you. Guys, wait up! They make these chairs smaller? You 're a speedy little guy, are n't you? Come on, guys. Help me. Help me, help me. I can see my feet again. My skinny, skinny, little feet. That 's it. That is it! You do n't own me anymore, old devil sugar! I love you. No! No! Now, bud, you 've done this a million times. You got nothing to be nervous about. Then why am I sweating through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all the confidence in the world in you. Okay, just remember, if her mouth is open and nothing 's coming out, you cut to commercial. No worries, honey. And I mean pronto. Lola, I ca n't remember anything. What am I gon na do? Do n't worry, I got your back. Oh, cue cards. Great idea. - What if I forget how to read? - Get a grip. This is the life, hold on tight. This is the dream, it 's all you need. Hey, you 're right. You know, that 's great advice. What advice? Those are the lyrics to your song. Of course they are! I 'm not nervous. I 'm good. - Places, Miss Montana. - Help me! I will. Just remember, keep your eyes on me. Right. What song is that from? That 's not a song, that was the advice! Oh, boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? - Maybe he came to support a friend. - Or maybe he came to laugh at me. Could be. Either way, good luck. Four, three, two... And now, live and acoustic, Top Rockers is proud to present! Give it up for Hannah Montana! Take the world, shake and stir And that 's what I got going on I throw my cares up in the air And I do n't think they 're coming down Yeah, I love how it feels right now Still loving how it feels right now Down in front! You never know where you 'll... And I 'm gon na take my... I 'm still getting it wrong Hold on tight And this is the dream, it 's all I need You 'll never know where you 'll find it And I 'm gon na take my time, yeah I 'm still getting it right, this is the life And you were worried. A whole new scene and I 'm swimming with a new crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm building them up from the ground Yeah, I love how it feels right now Whosaid, whosaid I wo n't be Superman? I say, I say that I know I can Who said, who said I ca n't be President? I say, I say you ai n't seen nothing yet Who said? Thank you, all. You know, I had a rough patch at the beginning of the show and an even rougher patch earlier this week. But I learned something that I should 've known all along. Good friends do n't bail on you. And they 're always there to catch you if you fall. We love you, Hannah! - I love you, too! I love you all! Thank you everybody. Good night. I love you, Jackson. That 's right. I 'm talking to you, big boy. You 're not real. Can I have a bite of that, big boy? I do n't think I can do this. Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Okay. - I 'm positive I ca n't do this. - Yes, you can. You were there for me and I 'm gon na be there for you. I love the energy I 've seen today, I love the passion. But most of all I love that we 're almost done. Stewart, Oken, take us home, please. Okay, remember, all you have to do is die. Go. Oh, Romeo. Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. Oh, Romeo. And now I die. I see the light. Again, longer than it took him to write the play.
