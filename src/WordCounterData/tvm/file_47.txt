5218041 Thank you, sir. Have a nice day. Next in line, please. Ooh, a week in Hawaii. I 'll fill in for you. Are you sure? You just take your honeymoon before I change my mind. - Thank you. - There you go, sir. - Thank you very much. - Have a nice day, sir. Next in line, please. Hey, Darnell. I did n't know you had an account here. As a matter of fact, I never saw you out of the projects. Shut the fuck up and empty the fucking drawer! Empty the drawer! Next in line, please. Come on, Darnell. Darnell, do n't do this. Now come on. Stop, please. Why are you playing? It 's not a fucking game. Empty the fucking drawer! Hell, no. I want nothing to do with this. Everyone get on the fucking floor now! Get the fuck on the floor! Give me the money! Come on. Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get your ass on the floor. Give him the money. Lay your ass down! Stay there! Hurry up! Fill it up! Give him the money! Give him the money, bitch! And hurry up, God damn it! I said, hurry up! Give us everything in the drawer. Oh, my God! - Do n't cry now. - Hurry it up! Here. Here. Take it. It 's yours. Go! Go! Go! Shit. Oh, my God! Come on, man! Everybody stay down! Is everyone OK? Why do n't we take it from the top? I thought we covered everything. How well did you know the perpetrator? I 've just known Darnell from around the way is all. We live in the same projects. Frankie, will you do me a favor? Just tell me one thing, and we 'll get out of here. Sure. What 's the procedure when you 're being robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Now... what 's the procedure when you 're being robbed? You pull the money clip from your right-hand drawer... and then you signal with the left hand. You signal with the left. So you know the procedure. Yes. The procedure has been told to me over a million times. So why is it... if that procedure 's been drummed into your head... a million times... you got that procedure down... why would n't you follow it? Because he had a gun! And I went for my clip, but he shot her. He shot her right in front of me. I 'm afraid we 're going to have to let you go. That you knew the perpetrator does n't sit well with us. Wait. But that 's not right. I have n't done anything wrong! I ca n't help who I know! Mr. Zachary, just last week, you gave me a promotion... and now you 're going to take my job away? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank? How do we know you 're not in collusion? Collusion? Let me tell you something... I am here at 2:20 sharp every morning... and I work my ass off until quitting time. Yesterday, I counted $240,000 by hand for you! That 's how you should know! I mean... come on! This is just not right! I nearly got blown away in your tight-ass fucking bank... and you 're going to fire me? - Calm down. - You could n't even wait! You did n't even bother to ask me if I was thirsty, sister. She 's involved. I want everything you have on her. I thought I said a Seventies graduation party. Seventies, Halloween. What 's the difference? You 're the only one in the neighborhood... to give a Seventies graduation party. Anyway, T.T., Jajuan... y'all look awfully groovy tonight. You like it, girl? Thank you for following directions. Simple directions. Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he wants to be. I know it. Can you believe he 's going to college? Man, I remember when you was just a little scrub... always trying to follow us around and shit. On that tricycle. Y'all always trying to mess up somebody 's game. Please. What game? Whatever. Stony, you got a ten I can borrow? We need some more chips. Stuff running out. Come on, college boy. You 're the one that 's going to be making all the loot. You have to stop spoiling that boy. You 've been taking care of him since your mama and daddy died. What you got? You ai n't drinking none of this shit. Stevie, what 's the problem? I 'm not going. I ai n't going to college. What? All right, look. Do n't start tripping, OK? You can not change your mind. We got into UCLA, and that 's where we 're going. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholarship. They did n't give you a scholarship? But we told them the only way we could apply... I know. All right. Well, do n't worry about it. I 'll take care of it. It 's probably just because I 'm a January graduate. How are you going to take care of it? You can barely pay the bills around here. I 'll just get a job. I 'll help around here until... No. Wrong. We 're going to stick to the plan... and we are definitely getting you up out of here. I ai n't hearing what this fool... Good afternoon, ladies... and gentlemen. All right. Listen up. Now, these good white folks are trying to recycle... all of their glasses, plastics, and aluminum... and you bitches putting all the shit in the dumpsters. You gots to recycle. Who had 104? I did. You did n't empty the cans in 104. I 'm docking your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be? Goddamn Mighty Morphin fucking Power Ranger? What you going to do? I 'm docking her pay! Speaking of pay, I thought you said... that you was going to pay me under the table. They 're taking taxes out of my check. I do n't even got enough money to pay for my baby-sitter. On this good earth... there are three peoples I do n't mess with... the " I, " the " R, " and the " S. " But I got my baby-sitter! If you do n't like working for Luther 's Janitorial... why do n't you just take your broke ass home? Otherwise, shut the fuck up and get back to work! You one cold-hearted motherfucker, Luther. Get back to work. You did n't have to talk to her like that! Tisean, you have got to learn to stand up for yourself. Did y'all hear what happened to Frankie? Our Frankie? Lorenz and them robbed a bank. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wanted in Nevada, Arizona... He 's damn near professional. What 's he, twenty-one? - They 're getting younger. - Yeah? I want everything you got on his young ass... where he hangs out, who he knows, where mom lives. Everything. I want it all. Look at that. Check that out. His hair. What is that? " A... P "? What 's that, a nickname? " Asshole, perhaps "? Oh, fuck off. Cleo... when you gon na fix this raggedy shit? Never mind my shit, fool. Frankie, I heard what happened at the bank the other day. Keep your head up, girl, all right? Up. Up. Watch this motherfucker. That 's all right. Your shit is original. Damn right. Do n't worry, my shit is going to be tight. Cleo, you 've been fixing up this car since seventh grade. Do you know Lorenz and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn. See, that 's what the fuck we need to do... rob a bank. No. That 's crazy. Really, though. The four of us could take a bank. If that crackhead Darnell can rob a bank, we can. Twenty Gs would save my life right now. Stevie needs tuition. Well, too bad we ai n't some hard-up... crackhead motherfuckers like Lorenz and them. Then we could do some suicidal shit like rob a bank. But we ai n't crazy, so we ca n't. So now you making the rules? Frankie, please! Ai n't nobody over here going to be robbing no bank. You 're right. We ai n't going to rob no bank. Let 's just go in there and blow it the fuck up! Here you go. Can you believe after working at that bank for two years... I ca n't get a recommendation for another job? All right, I 'm going to hook you up with Luther. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job. Ursula, come here. How you doing, Ursula? What 's up? What the fuck is up with that? She do n't talk? Not really. Girl, next time I page you, you better be calling me back. Excuse me. Drink, please. What 's up, girl? That 's a cute outfit. Want some? Hey, Stony, look, girl. There 's Nate Andrews. Girl, did n't he want you to work in his car lot for him? Yes, and that 's not all he wanted. You going over there? Yeah. I 'm going to see what he wants. So how much money could I make selling cars for you? Well, it depends. I mean, you can make... two Gs a month on commission. - That much? - Yeah! I told you you needed to get somebody who could help you. Nate, before I come work for you... I need an advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix. Oh! I can do that. But I mean, Stony Newsome... you got to give me a reason to do that. You know what I mean? What would that be? Come on, now. You know. Let 's go for a ride, huh? So when do I get my advance? I do n't know. Tomorrow. Maybe the day after. Nate, before I do this, I want my check. Whoa. Look, you 're not getting no check from me... until I 'm done, you understand? This ai n't right. It 's not even worth it. Shit. I 'm in a bind, Nate. Some other time. I really need this money, Nate. What the fuck is that? It 's Frankie. It 's her first night. - What 's wrong with you? - Nothing. Look at this motherfucker. Bet you he ai n't never held a broom in his life... and she ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ugly-ass baby! You know, white people be having some old water head... crying-ass, ugly babies. I ca n't unload these things without dropping them. Frankie, relax! How can you stand the smell of this garbage? - The shit ai n't that bad. - Ai n't that bad? Cleo, you live in a garage! Girl, it 'll be OK. And you... stay out of it. Damn. Look at my nails! Shit, girl, you been bitchin ' all night. Stony back there acting all stank-a-dank-dank. That 's all right. I got something for that here. Ow, girl! That hurt. That 's the only way you get the knot out. Yep. I rolled this one good. Blunt talking to me, motherfucker. Stop it, girl. Stinky. There. Cleo, I done told you I 'm strictly dickly. I 'm going to tell Ursula. You 're going to tell nobody. Check out Stony. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her ass all quiet. Look at her sitting over there. Hey, you fucked up, ai n't you, girl? What? What 's wrong with them? You know. Every time we get high... you start looking like Sugar Bear. For real. Y'all cold. You do kind of look like Sugar Bear. Fuck all y'all. Simple bitches. Cleo, do n't get salty. Damn. Before they started laying people off... they was paying folks fifteen dollars an hour at that place. Man. That 's good money! For fifteen dollars an hour, I 'd be all... " Fuck, I 'm right here. " What I got ta do, Sir Ass Motherfucker? " They 'd have to pull me off that damn machine. Shit. That overtime would be twenty-two fifty an hour! I do n't know what I 'm going to do. Now that Luther 's taking taxes out of my check... I 'm making half as much as I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take a bank. Now, see, I 'm with that shit. Y'all niggers done lost your mind. We might as well not even talk about this shit no more. I 'm talking about it. Ai n't nobody going to stop me from talking about it. Well, talk is cheap... nigger. Wait. I mean, you know? Frankie, you gon na get slapped. What? You always talking shit. You want to blow the bank up, now you want to rob it. Frankie want to blow up the bank Frankie want to rob the bank I ai n't heard nothing about that. I said, hang up the phone. You know who that is. Yeah. I got ta go. I 'll be over. Do n't drink up my champagne, man. Peace. Champagne? Whatever. I ai n't got time. Look! Did your sister come through for you or what? - Where 'd you get this? - Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just look at the digits. Stony, there 's something I got to tell you. Look, I know this is hardly enough money... but I will get every... No. Listen to me. I did n't get into UCLA... and I 'm not going because I did n't get accepted. You did n't get in? Do n't go off on me now. Do n't you tell me not to go off on you! Do you have any idea what I had to go through? Do you? I 'm not staying around for this. You are going to hang around for this, so do n't move. Why did you have to lie to me? Stony, you know how long you told me... that I had to go to college? Well, I 'm sorry, but maybe that life is just not for me. Shit. Who is it? Lorenz, it 's Stevie, man. Come on. Open up, man. Hey, Lorenz, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank. I did n't rob no bank. I heard your party was awful good. You know why I did n't come. Your sister do n't like me. She be trippin '. Nah, she cool, man. To let you tell it. Here, Mr. UCLA. Here. You all right? - Yeah. I 'm straight, man. - All right. Hey, that " AP " is phat. " Acorn Projects. " Man, I thought you knew! Oh, well... You want this? No, man. I 'm straight. No. You know your sister whup your ass. My sister ai n't gon na do nothing. Tamika, hook him up. He ai n't from Acorn. Fuck all that. Get the clippers, hook his ass up. Take your ass in the kitchen with your raggly ass. You talk too much.

What you fucking with me for? - Man down! - We 've got it covered! - Get in here! - Go, go! God, no! What have you done? Excuse me. This motherfucker. If you need to talk, if you have any questions... I hope you wo n't hesitate to call. There will be a full investigation. - No! - All right. OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got? Stevie Newsome. No priors. Good student. Headed for college, I hear. Both parents killed in a car accident four years ago. God damn it. We can do this. We can get some wigs, some sunglasses, and it 's on. Y'all gon na have to do this without me. I keep thinking about Darnell getting killed and Lorenz shot. That 's because Darnell and them were a bunch of damn fools. They do n't know half of what I know about banks. What if something goes wrong? What if somebody gets hurt? Listen to me. You 're just scared, baby. Ai n't nobody gon na get hurt. That 's why this is the perfect crime. I know this too well. What about all them folks ' money? - Insurance. - Dumb-ass comment. Look, we 're just taking away from the system... that 's fucking us all anyway. You know? Let 's do it. Excuse me. How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'd like to open up a new account. Right this way. You can open up an interest- bearing checking account... with a thousand dollar deposit, if you like. - It 's up to you. - A thousand dollars? Do you have long lines? Not too bad. We usually operate with about fourteen tellers. Actually, I 'm a manager in corporate banking upstairs. I do n't know what these folks do down here... but when I saw you, I said to myself... " Self, a woman that fine... " As fine as you are, and you are that fine... " Needs to have her own personal banker. " So I could n't help myself. She smiles. Come on, now. Ms. Dorsey, I 'm new in town... and I swear to you, I do n't do this all the time. I know you do n't know me from Adam. I do n't know what your plans are tonight... Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out? - Maybe. Keith, well, I see you 're in new accounts now. Nigel, thank you. Thank you for your observation there. These people are going to kill me. Now, can I have your number? But I 'll take yours. Well, what were you doing in there? I was just talking. But I thought we was here to case the bank. That 's what I was doing. He has an inside track. He works here. Plus he grabbed me. Did he ask you out? Maybe. So you ai n't gon na tell me, huh? Well, maybe he could put a smile on my face. Girl, Luther is gon na kill you if he sees that baby. - T.T., What happened? - I had to bring him with me. Hey, wait. Whoa! Do n't put him there, please. Put him over there. Come on! - Come on! Move it! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time! Let 's go! Let 's go! Open the elevator! Open it up! Hurry up! It 's all right. I think your son is going to pull through just fine. - Yes. - Can I see him? You need to speak with Ms. Wells with Child Protective Services. No. I know you ai n't fixing to take her son. Wait, hold the fuck up. That was an accident. We was right there, looking right at him. It was n't two seconds... I need to talk to the mother alone. Ms. Williams, the boy has been severely poisoned. I 'm sure it was an accident... but we 're going to retain custody just to be sure... the child is n't suffering from neglect. That 's my son. I would die for him. He was in an unsafe environment. He should n't have been at the workplace with you. I did n't have a choice. I do n't have money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove you can take care of him. Kids get into poison every day. Not in the workplace. To us, that spells neglect. Now, Jajuan will remain in our custody... until you can pay for proper child care. What if I ca n't come up with the money? Like I said, you will get a court date. At that time, the judge will decide what will happen. Please! You ca n't take my baby. I 'm going to die without my baby. Tisean, come on. I 'm gon na die without my baby. T. T, we 're going to handle this. Fuck this shit. You know what you got to do. You know. You in? Come on, T.T. Cleo, take the note to the merchant teller. She will have at least twenty grand. On Wednesdays, Sears makes a big deposit... so she could have thirty-five thousand. I give her the note and tell her not to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right-hand clip. If she does, she 's setting off the alarm. " Do n't give me any bait money... " and if you come out of that right-hand clip... " my gun goes in your mouth. " That 's what I 'm talking about. Let 's go through plan " B. " Plan " B "? Fuck this planning shit. Why ca n't we just kick butt with these motherfuckers... and go up in there and take all the fucking money? Why ca n't you just listen for once? Plan " B, " Frankie. Stony, when Cleo goes to the merchant teller... you start to survey the line for the cow. Cow? There 's going to be a cow up in there? Stop smoking weed. Cleo, the cow is just a small vault on wheels. They push it from window to window... depending on which teller needs cash. If the cow is there, it 'll be open... and we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to Black Sam. Black Sam, she want to talk to you. Damn. Shit. - So what you need? - A favor. Yeah, well, what else is new? Come on, Black Sam. After all them cars I done stole for you? We 're going there, huh? All right, check it out. Y'all can roll with that right there. We ai n't robbin ' stagecoaches. I need something I can set it off with. Y'all ai n't bullshitting? We want them guns we were shooting. You 're tripping. Y'all ca n't afford them guns. That 's why it 's a favor. I 'll bring them back... with interest. With interest, huh? Check this. What 's up with hooking me up with your homegirl, Frankie? Interest. That 's it, Sam. It 's like that. I 'm going to let y'all use my shit, right? But if y'all get caught... I 'm already knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm coming back for that Uzi, too. Bruce, go on and hook them up. The right shit. All right. Come on, baby. What have we got here? Bullshit. Fucking bullshit. Now, that 's what I ride to. OK, ready? Y'all OK? OK, wait a minute. Let 's just wait. OK, let 's just wait. Just for a second. What 's wrong? I ca n't do this. Frankie, she 's right, OK? We did n't case this bank. We cased Downtown Federal. They 're all pretty much the same. I ai n't feeling this, Frankie. This ai n't right. Everybody get down on the ground right now! Put your hands up! Everybody stay down! Go! Go! - All right! - Turn around! All of y'all, turn the fuck around! - Do n't move! - Move back! Move back! Turn around, girl! What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pull out the drawer! Put the phone down! Put your arms up! You better lay down! - Do n't move! - Y'all just be cool! Do n't move! Do n't move! Stay there. Fuckers... what are you looking at? I 'm a bitch with a gun! Two! We 're taking too much time! - Come on! - Here we go. Move it! We 're almost to the door. Come on! Go, go! Now, that 's how you work it. That shit was brilliant! Frankie, we robbed a bank! Listen to me. That is a lot of money. Are we going to get away with this? What do you mean? What does this look like? Is it ours? Shit! Did you lock that door? - Where have you been? - I caught the bus. We were n't ready. You know we were n't ready. Look, if I did n't set it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months. I had to push off! It worked, did n't it? Look, Tisean, it 's over. We got about... - What? - About twelve Gs. Twelve thousand dollars in sixty seconds. Why do n't you come over here and sit down beside me? OK? Come on. Sit! The vehicle stolen from here today was IDed... as the getaway car in that South L.A. Bank job. I want to run prints on all these. See if anybody shows up. All right. Dust everything. Moi. And... T.T. T.T.? She ai n't getting a cut. Look, Frankie, I ai n't for your shit tonight. T.T. Needs it more than any of us. She did n't do anything. She walked out. Who the fuck cares? She was there. No! She did n't do nothing, so she ai n't getting nothing. Forget it. Frankie, I do n't want your money. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over with... because I am sick of your shit. I need that money. It ai n't you I 'm mad at. Damn. I 'm sorry. I was tripping. You 're my girl. I need this. You are so special, Frankie. Still ai n't do shit. Waller, anything ever come up on that Francesca Sutton girl? The bank teller suspected... of being in collusion in the Pan-Pacific robbery? Nothing. Clean as a whistle. OK, run this again for me. - Come in for a drink? - No, thank you. - You sure? - Yeah. All right. Let me get my jacket. I could have come and picked you up. No. I needed the exercise, thanks. - You look great. - Thanks. - What? - Nothing. I 've just never been out with a guy like you before. A guy like me. What does that mean? I see. You must be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat? Maybe you could show me someplace in your hood. - In my hood? - In your hood. No, you ai n't trying to flow like that. I might be trying to flow like that. You 're probably from Harvard and all. As a matter of fact, I am. I still got to eat. I 'm still very hungry, so could we please feed a man... give him some nourishment or some sustenance? That 's all I 'm asking... Miss You-need-to-starve- **27;2389;TOOLONG. This is really a nice restaurant. It 's black-owned. I like that. Do you come here often? No. I 've never been. I just heard about it. So where are you from? D.C. Have you ever been? Nope. No, but that 's where the mayor got popped basing up, is n't it? Nobody 's perfect, right? It 's a great town, though. I really miss it. Anyway, I came directly from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever been outside Los Angeles? When I was in New York, I was working on Wall Street... and before that, " B " School... Business school. I 'm sorry. I wanted to go to business school. Really? Financing? Marketing? No. Typing and bookkeeping. I 'm sorry. Is that not professional enough? It 's just hard for me to believe that you 're this hard... when you 're so beautiful. And so tough. Not tough. I do n't think we have anything in common. I do n't want anything from you. I really do n't. I have no expectations, no demands. I am quite content... just listening to you... sitting here... staring into those beautiful, pretty brown eyes. Are you cross-eyed? No. Your head is just small. My head is small. Makes my eyes go this way... because I have to focus in on your little peanut. No, I 'm just kidding. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home. I took the lease over from my brother... who brought me to L.A. Do you feel free? Hell, yeah, I feel free. Well, I do n't feel free. I feel very much caged. Caged? What are you doing about it? What do you mean? What are you doing to get out of it? What are your plans? Where do you see yourself in five years, Stony? I do n't know. That 's what I 'm saying. We do n't plan for the future, as a people. Have you ever thought about it? Just put some serious thought into seeing your future? Well, I worked really hard to keep... a roof over me and my brother 's head... to keep clothes on our back... And I planned on sending him to college. That 's great. Then he should go to college. He 'll go on and accomplish tremendous things... and be great and wonderful, like his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't realize. - It 's OK. - No, it 's not. I 'm dealing with it. You are, are n't you? Is that a cabernet or a merlot? Damn. - Take care of it. - All right. Captain Fredricks, sir? Do you remember the Pan-Pacific bank robbery... where four people were killed and the subsequent arrest... where a young man was shot and killed? We 're still getting bad press with that. I 'd like to bring in his sister Lita Newsome. I think she 's one of the bank robbers. What you got? Right now I 've got a girl named Francesca Sutton. She 's a teller at the Pan-Pacific bank... and I 'm relatively certain she was connected. Go on. Francesca Sutton and Lita Newsome are best friends. Right, that 's a big coincidence... but there 's also a physical likeness... Do you remember the headline? " Innocent student killed by cops. " Now you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows someone... who may be friends with a bank robber? You 're goddamn right... What the hell 's wrong with you, Strode? No way! Can I get a tail on her, sir? What part of " no " do n't you understand, Strode? The " N " or the " O "? Oh, shit, now. Watch it! Fuck them niggers. Yeah! Watch it, honey. Here it come now. Yeah, now. Shit, girl. What is you... Cleo, how come you ai n't been to work in a week? ' Cause look what I got here. I bought my baby some new things. Check them out. Luther said you 're fired. We got to act like nothing 's different. You need to get to Luther 's and get your job back. Man, Luther can kiss my ashy kneecap. This money got you tripping. I know you out of money by now, Cleo. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. What the fuck is y'all thinking? Hold up. We said once, Cleo... to get us enough change to get out of here! That 's all it is, Stony. We need some real money. I do n't know how far out of town you plan to get, baby sister... but you ai n't getting far on three grand. Really? All right, Louise, you take Thelma over there... and y'all go rob another bank if you all that. Fuck you. I know you ai n't fin to back down on us now we need you. I want some more mother_fucking money. You are real high... and you acting real stupid. You need to get that gun out my face. Shit! Do n't you ever fucking raise a gun to me again! Or what? What! Are you going to hit me, motherfucker? Stony, we go back to first grade! You been my peeps for twenty years! Get off of me! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more. Yeah, well, fuck you, too! Fuck her!? Ay, qu? linda! Come on in. How you doing? I 'm all right. You sure? All right. Hope you like Mexican food. We have fajitas, enchiladas, special sauce. Have a seat right there. You say you do n't travel a lot. This is what we 're going to do, Stony. From here on out, I cook. We eat. You pick the country, starting with Mexico. Now, sit back. Relax. Take a load off your feet. Smell the aroma of Mexico and the sounds... What? I just got a lot on my mind. You want to talk about it? What do you think about friends and money? I think they do n't mix. Why? I just had a very big argument... with one of my best friends about a money situation... and I do n't think we 're gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money. It 's not worth it. The money you can replace easy. Friends... real friends... you ca n't. Do n't sweat it. You have the answer to everything, do n't you? No, I would n't say that.

I mean, what am I going to do in Hollywood... or Thousand Oaks or some shit? Man, shit. Why do we got to roll over and accept that, though? We got to have a plan. What does our future look like? Where do you see yourself five years from now? I do n't know... and I do n't care. And I ai n't thinking about five years from now. I 'm just trying to get through today. What the hell? Cleo, I know you did n't come to work. Ai n't been to work and do n't call nobody. I 'm broke, Luther. I know you gon na give me my old job back...

There 's been a rift in this family... and that is not good for business. We want a plan like it was. Back to work, see? If only Tisean and Stony will come rob the bank with us. We started as a gang of four. We must always be four. Don Stony from the Bronx, what is your opinion? Should we rob the bank? Only way I can return to this family. If we do this one more time, we do it right. Get enough money to get us up out of here for good. T.T., you agree? Cleomenza, no more funny-looking underwear... for your little girlfriend. Cleomenza... no more... fancy cars. The shopping sprees... Cleomenza, can you respect our conditions? Can you live with the terms that your dons have set forth? Yes, Godfather.

Sir, please, will you stop? You 're annoying our customers out here. I 'm not hurting anybody. Come on, man. I want you to move down and leave our people alone. Now, I 've been asked to come out here... Come on, man. I 'm not hurting anybody. - You 're drunk. - No, I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it! You, down! Hands over your head! Back away from the drawers!

Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Yeah! We dig that shit! The way you busted through that wall! We did it! I thought it was over, with the cops right outside! Where was you going? I was coming to get y'all 's asses! What about T.T.? The way she got the drop on the cop! If you think of anything else, give us a call today. - Where 's the girls? - Took off in the Suburban. The getaway car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft reports from near the 21st Street garage. Getting in way over their heads, are n't they? They do n't fucking know it. Man, counting money is harder than working for Luther. I 'm getting dizzy up here! Two hundred and ninety-six thousand and counting! - What 's that? - Seventy-five thousand apiece. Seventy-five thousand apiece. That 's a lot of money. I 'm rich! Look at all of this. Look, this is what we 're going to do. We 're going to keep scrubbing floors for Luther... like we 've been doing. Nothing 's changed. We get Jajuan, and in three days, we are out of here! I 'm going to miss you all. Well, what happened? What did she do? Girl, you know you coming with us. I got money! You run the CDs from the parking garage? Yeah. They 're clean. Give these a try. It 's all connected. All right. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the money in here instead of at home? If the police track us down, that 's the first place to look. All right. Stony, listen. I 'm substituting for my boss tonight... at a party for the National Association of Bankers... at the Biltmore, and I 'd like for you to come... Damn it. That would be really nice. Great. Listen, be here early, like 6:00... because I do n't know what time the limo 's coming... since you wo n't let me pick you up. Limo? Black tie. Limo. 6:00. I 'll see you then. Y'all are real rude. I know you heard me on the phone. Do you like it? Yeah. You look great. No, you do n't. No. It 's colorful. We 're late. I 'll be right back. I told Frankie I look like a box of crayons. So, you like? It 's real nice. You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending a lot of time together lately... and it 's been nice. We 've been real straightforward with one another, honest... but I have lied about one thing. What have you lied about? Let 's take a little detour. Alex, do me a favor. Change of plans. Take a right at the next light, and I 'll tell you from there. Should we go? You 're doing great, baby. Enjoy yourself tonight. - Champagne? - Yes. Thank you. Are you nervous? - Do n't be. - OK. You are the most beautiful lady in the room. Do n't you ever forget that. Hey, Nigel. How you doing, buddy? - How you doing? - Patrice. Thank God you 're here. I was getting tired... of making clever banter with Ross Milner. - Hello. I 'm Nigel. - Hi. You 're Miss New Account. Your follow-up is impressive. I taught Keith everything about corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady. There are some heavy hitters here... Muchigawa from Sonawa. Yeah. I saw Storum from Citibank over there. Check this out... if a terrorist blew this place up... the banking systems of Japan, Europe... and the United States would never recover. I thought that a room full of dead bankers... meant that the world would be a better place. My wife. So, Stony, are you in banking also? Yes... in a way. Wells Fargo, B. Of A., Chemical? I prefer to create my own personalized portfolio... reflecting an original, diverse taste in funding sources. Well. Always got me in trouble. Always raiding sororities. So he has n't grown up yet, but we 're working on him. Right. He seems like a nice guy. No. He 's terrible. I hate him. He 's a good guy. I want you to know... this is one of the best nights of my life. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now? Well, for now, but it 's not my life. I 've just borrowed from pieces of yours. Borrowing 's not a bad thing, as long as you return the favor. Look at all your friends. They all own banks. Where I 'm from, you 're lucky to have a bank account. I just want to get out of here. Have you ever felt like that... like you just wanted to get up and go... and move forward and you ca n't? Baby, you do n't have to go anywhere. Stay with me for a little while... and then you decide if you want to stick around. You think about it. With your fine self. You crazy. Hi. I 'm Pete Rodney. I 'm taking over for Luther. Where 's Luther? He ai n't cleaning this building no more. He got out of the business. I 'm going to... - Hi. - How you doing? This motherfucker better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Come on. - It 's gone. I 'm going to kill this motherfucker! Come on. Yo, Sam. You got company. Hey, Sam, you seen Luther? Luther came by here earlier. Looked like he came upon some dollars. Had this shit all permed up. What 's up? We got twisted, man... our money and your interest. That 's why that fool was acting crazy. See, now you 're fucking with my money, though. But I know where he at. He at a hotel over there on 55th... 55th and Ninth. Thanks. Got a little something for that ass, baby. Climb out the pussy for a minute, Luther. Find it! Look all around this room. Tear it up if you have to. You think you slick, huh? Check her stuff, too. You slick, right? You better be here for a good goddamn reason. Money is a good goddamn reason. Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to ask you one more time. Where 's my money? Cleo, look, I do n't know nothing about no money. You do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about? What the fuck is this, huh? Look at this shit... watches and crystal... and shit you done bought with my mother_fucking money. Talking all that nonsense. You do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about. Now look... I ai n't lying. What the fuck is this? My money. All right, bro. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. " Alissa Lyons, 423 Moorpark. " You did n't see none of this shit, right? All right. Just a little fucking insurance, baby. Now where the fuck did Luther hide that money? I swear I do n't know. Damn it, do n't give me that! You know! I swear I just met him. - Come on. - Give me the money! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so. This weekend. Italian. I 'll call you. Man, I ai n't trying to hear this shit today. Which one of you girls smoked Luther? I 'm thinking it was you... because you 're the only one with any priors. I do n't know what the fuck you talking about. I 'll tell you what the fuck I 'm talking about. We 're going to take a ride down to Parker Center. Man, you ai n't got probable cause for shit. All you 're doing is participating in a lineup. And for the record, having a witness... is one fuck of a lot better than probable cause. Get in the car. Today! Take this home. Call the girls. - They ca n't see me? - Just your imagination. Looks like they 're looking right at me. Do you see her? The person that killed Luther Morris? Take your time and concentrate. Face right! Do you see her... the person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Be sure now. Do you see her... the person that killed Luther Morris? Look at her! Get a real good look, real close. Right there. See her? The person that smoked Luther. Nope. Can I go now? You 're real cute. They got Cleo, and y'all fucking killed Luther! He would n't give up the money. He was about to kill Cleo, so Tisean shot him. Now I got Cleo in trouble. - Damn it! Shit! - I 'm sorry, Stony. Look... they 're going to be after all of us. We 're going to take that bank downtown. Are you in? No, I ai n't in! Hell, no! You ai n't got no fucking choice. And you do n't tell me what fucking choices I have, Frankie! That 's armed robbery... and it 's murder. You said we were n't going to hurt anybody, Frankie. Girl, I got to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ca n't go to jail... for killing nobody. I need you. I really need you. Cleo, what happened? You all right? Baby, go pack our shit. Them motherfuckers was all over me... but I represented. Now the problem is, they on our ass now... and we got to do two things... rob another bank and get the fuck out of here... or we going to be in jail by tomorrow morning. I say we hit Downtown Federal. That 's where the most money 's at. I 'm telling y'all, we could get five hundred thousand. Fuck it. We hitting that shit. Simple as that. Look, Stony, we hot! We all facing a murder rap! Does it have to be Downtown Federal? What the fuck is that? What, did you go and play us... over that bumpy at the bank? Fine. It 's on. I know you have a court date tomorrow. Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think everything 's going to be OK. I 'm sure it is. Come here. Everything 's going to be just fine. Come on. Let 's go. OK, ladies, will that be all? Some more coffee. I do n't think you should be drinking so much coffee. You making me nervous. How the fuck is my drinking coffee making you nervous? - I do n't know. It just is. - OK, OK. Listen up. Nobody 's ever successfully robbed this bank. I wish you would stop saying that. The nearest freeway is a mile away. We got to stick to the plan, all right? I know y'all sick of wearing them wigs. What you got? I got some other stuff in the car. Thank you, ladies. Cover my share until I finish robbing this bank. Shoot, I 'm broke. Do n't look over here. I am, too. Y'all... we do n't have enough money to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the fuck is this? - What are you doing? Trying to find some mood music. Fuck it. Radio. Look at that. Yo, what 's up with that dress? You going dancing or something? What you got? One for you... one for you. Check it out. There has been a rash of these robberies... in the Los Angeles area as far east as Pasadena... and as far north as the San Fernando Valley. They seem to know the inner workings of each bank. Wigs and sunglasses aid them in their disguise. Their m.o. Is " in and out. " Please do not be misled by the fact... that these four bandits are females. Once they get in here, it 's not going to be... " Stick them up and give me your dough. " Your lives are going to be in jeopardy, and that 's a fact. These girls are the real deal. They 've gotten real good at casing the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. What the fuck are you doing? They know the intricacies of bank security systems... and more importantly, they know how to get around them. They may even have a contact on the inside, so be aware. Obviously, they do n't appear this way... when they 're on the street. This is Keith. Keith, listen to me. I need you to meet me at the soul-food restaurant... in five minutes. Baby, why...

Police reports indicate that the women... are from Los Angeles. They 've been identified... as Lita Newsome, Francesca Sutton... Tisean Williams, and Cleopatra Simms.
