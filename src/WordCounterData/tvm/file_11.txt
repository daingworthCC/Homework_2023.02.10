[Clears_Throat] You have often episodes like this? S, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Sensitive? Yes. Sensitive to... subtle vibrations, at least. What do you mean by vibrations? You see, the universe sends us messages all the time. Vibrations. And for certain people like you, those vibrations become intuitions... or visions, if you want. That is what affects your perception of time and space. Yes. Sometimes very painful. Hmm. [Sighs]?? [Humming] [Speaking_Spanish] [Door_Opens] [Amapola] Hello. Hey. Hi. You are punctual. Yes. And I was very lucky to find this incredible place on my own. This hotel is full of secrets. Yes. This room was my grandfather 's pride and joy. Midsummer Night 's Dream, right? Yes. That 's Pyramus and Titania right there. No, I mean the play that you guys are putting on tonight. Oh, it 's just our homemade version, I 'm afraid. Poor Shakespeare. Everybody seems to take it very seriously. People come from all over to see it, actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once. In high school. Who did you play? Pyramus. And believe it or not, I was n't very good. That 's hard to believe. Where did you go to school? Boise, Idaho. Ever heard of it? No. Is it nice? Nice? [Scoffs] It 's the nicest place on God 's green earth. Except for right here, of course. Do you miss it? Yeah. Yeah, I do. It 's not perfect, but to watch the sun set over the panhandle, sipping a mint julep... What 's a mint julep? Only the most delicious libation known to man. So what brought you so far from Boise, Idaho? You ever heard of the Vietnam War? Only a couple thousand times, yes. Well, I 've heard about it so many times... that I decided to skip the fight and go on a journey. So here I am, traveling the world... and taking pictures that I rarely sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I prefer " conscientious objector. " So, how long have you been conscientiously objecting? A couple of years now. Can I take your picture? Here? Well, why do n't you show me your world? [Scoffs] We do n't have to go far. I just... I just want you to show me something you love. Okay. Okay. [Chattering] Wait. Mmm. Smells delicious. This is my favorite place. No one ever gets to come here. [Gasps] Let me get that. No, no, no. What 's she saying? You can get fruit in the other room. [Chuckles] For me? S. What did she say? She reminded me that I once gave the river something I loved... and asked for it to bring true love back. And did it? I wonder. I 'm starting to think that... [Chuckles] miracles do happen. This... is the most delicious thing on earth. I thought that was mint julep. I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dance? Here? Here and now. This is crazy. Yeah. When I was a child, I used to come here every day... to practice my lines for the play... and pretend I was a prima Donna. It 's never too late for that. To be a prima Donna? On this island? I like it here, but it 's not a place to become a star. Yeah, but [Ama], this is your world. You can stay or you can leave this island. You can do what you want. You 're a very surprising creature, [Luke]. [Ama] It 's stopped raining. Come. [Creaking] [Shutter_Clicks] [Panting] I feel like, uh... Like there 's something I have to tell you. But I, uh...

I saw those horrible visions, and I do n't know if it was a vision at all. But it was just... very frightening. I do n't know. I do n't understand. Uh... Sometimes it 's not so important to understand things, but to act. Action is greater than thought. What do you mean? Your visions only happen because you can be in different moments in time... simultaneously. There are many worlds, [Ama], but they are all here.??

What do you mean? Why would you ask me that? Well, what about Sisy? Sisy? You have a child with her. - What? - A child. [Scoffs] So that 's why you never answered my letters. No. [Ama], do n't you understand? Sisy was never pregnant. Everything she told you was to get rid of you. [Sighs] [Clocks_Ticking] [Amapola] Oh, [Meme]. [Ticking_Continues] [Meme's_Voice] [Ama].
