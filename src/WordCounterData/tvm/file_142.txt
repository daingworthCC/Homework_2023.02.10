5236841 Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator... and vanished. He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own... and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better. His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong... and hoping each time that his next leap... will be the leap home. What the hell? You heard me.! Hands up! Everyone stay calm. We 'll get this over with and be on our way. Keep me covered while I shut the blinds. Do n't fall apart on me now, little brother. Oh, boy. As usual when I leap, I did n't have a clue as to who I was, or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did know fear when I saw it, and I saw it everywhere. I also had a strange feeling about this place. It seemed familiar. Check his office. I want Vernon out here now. You folks keep those hands up high. Do n't even think about going for that alarm button. Fill it! $37,893.19. Not a penny more, not a penny less. I do n't have that much cash. Open the vault. We ca n't. Mr. Vernon 's the only one who has the combination. Neil Walters, is that you? - You Bill Walters 's boys? - Never mind who we are. Bill Walters? Vernon is n't here! He is n't here! Where is he? Out of town on business. He wo n't be back till later this afternoon. Damn it! Maybe we should go on and get out of here fore things get out of hand. And go where? We come this far, we ca n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt. We just, uh-W-W-We go out that back door over there. What 's that? What 's it sound like? Nobody move! Willie, you check out the back. John, watch the door. Nobody move! Just keep those hands nice and high where I can see ' em. Nobody. Somebody must be in that back office. I 'll take a look. That was stupid. That was really stupid! Take it easy. Yelling at her is not gon na do any good. Come on. Get out of there. Go on. All right. All right! Somebody turn that alarm off. Turn it off! All right. Come on. Move! Back over there. Move it. All right, smart boy. What do you suggest we do now? Like I said, we can still go out the back way. Too late! Mundy just pulled up across the street. That would be Police Chief Clyde Mundy. Uh, Sam, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bank robbers ' room. Uh, excuse me. I, uh-I gotta-You need to go to the bathroom now? Yeah. L - I-I-I got ta go. When you got ta go, you got ta go. How do I keep getting into these situations? Do n't look at me. What 's going on, Al? Huh? You 're William Walters Jr., but everybody calls you " Willie. " It 's the 22nd of December, 1971. Where am I? You 're home, Sam. You 're in Elk Ridge, Indiana. I 'm - I 'm home? Mm-hmm. No wonder everything seemed so familiar. Yeah. Well, your memory 's a little Swiss-cheesed, you know. It 's ' 71. My dad 's still alive. I'm_I 'm home and-and... my dad 's still alive. Willie Walters? I knew a guy named Willie, Willie Walters. Uh, a couple years older than me. He - He - He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember. Well, the big one is Neil. He 's a couple years older than you. He 's a loose cannon. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in ' 69, and then he took a compassionate discharge a year later. Why? Uh, oh, his father died, and he came back to take charge of the family farm. Uh, the younger one is John. He 's still in high school. He 's never been in any kind of trouble. Yeah, until now. What about Willie? Willie - Indiana State University, honor student. He did n't come back home in time. In time for what? Uh, to save the family farm from foreclosure. Seems they were late a couple of months on a loan. $37,893- And 19 cents. Wh-They 're robbing the bank to pay the bank? Well, that has a certain symmetry to it. More like insanity. I do n't believe this. Why does Ziggy say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed trying to escape. Ziggy says there 's an 88.9% chance... that you 're here to see that the brothers surrender. Look, uh, ask Ziggy what happens to the farm after they lost it. What? Hey. You 're not thinking of going through with bank robbery? Just ask Ziggy what happened. Willie. Willie, you better get out here. Hello? Willie, is that you? Now look, son, you might as well talk to me. Everybody saw you and your brothers go into the bank. Hello, Chief Mundy. How ya been? How 've I been? Willie-I 've been fine until now. Now, uh, look, son. This thing is on the verge of gettin ' away from us here. Now listen to me, Chief. We do n't want anybody to get hurt here. Well, that 's good. Uh, so-Thank you, Flo. Why do n't you boys just throw out your guns and come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should 've worn them wigs. - Shut up! What 's he want? - He wants us to come out. - Not until we see Vernon. Vernon? Gus Vernon? Of course, Gus Vernon. He 's bank president, is n't he? He made the loan. He can unmake it. You said it looked like we did n't get a fair deal. Hello, Chief? Yeah. Uh, we were wondering if we could talk to Mr. Vernon. I mean, if that would be possible. Gus Vernon? He 's in Harker Falls. Need time to get him back here. Well, you better hurry up then. Nice talking to you again. Again? Billy. I want you to take that motorcycle of yours... and go over to Harker Falls and get Gus Vernon back here. Now go on. Oh, Flo? Can you give me a piece of that pecan pie? Oh, sure, Sheriff. Look out. Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, Chief? They say the-the Walters boys are in the bank with hostages. Just relax, Carl. We 've got everything under control. Relax? My wife is in there. I wan na know what you plan to do about this. Well, I plan on finishing my coffee and having a piece of pie. Then I plan on waiting for Gus Vernon. Wh-What about Cindy? I mean, y-you got ta get her outta there. Thank you, Flo. That 's all you 're gon na do then? Wait? That 's all I can do. I suggest you go on home and do the same thing, Carl. I do n't believe this. What kind of man are you anyway? A patient man. Go on now, fore I lose it. Why do n't you boys take those silly things off your faces? We all know who you are. Why are you doing this? If you could just be patient a little bit - Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father left my brothers and me when he died. We get up before the sun, and we do n't rest till after dark. Then along comes Gus Vernon. He tells you you ai n't gon na make it unless you increase the yield. Modernize, he says. Well, you 're afraid oflosing the only thing you got. So you go along, and you make the deal. But somehow, no matter how hard you work, you ca n't keep up. Pretty soon you 're selling off milk cows to make the next payment. It was just business. Well, we 'd like to hear Gus Vernon... explain that kind of business to us face-to-face. Yeah, I 'd love to hear that. Sam, it turns out that the Walters farm was one of six parcels bought at auction by an out-of-state developer... who went on to build the largest shopping center in the whole tri-county area, and Vernon made a fortune in kickbacks. He 's forcing the farms under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Do n't sound crazy to me. Sounds like a banker. - What the hell you talking about? - Sam, we should talk. Look, I 'll explain everything. I just, uh-- I just need a minute. - You got to go again? Yeah, I just need a second to-to think. Uh-Uh, I 'll be right back. Sam, I know that look. What look? What look? That look. The " I 'm gon na save the world " look. Ziggy says this leap 's over as soon as the brothers surrender. I ca n't do that. What do you mean you ca n't? Maybe I 'm not making myself clear here. I 'm talking life and death here. So am I. Do n't you get it, Al? It does n't matter if you kill a man with a gun or with a pen. In the end, he 's still dead. I 'm home, Al. And I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going the way it 's supposed to. Do n't tell me. Tell them. I know that you 're sympathetic with the situation here because it 's your hometown... and all of that, but Ziggy says there 's a 73.9% chance... that if you surrender, you 'll leap. Leap? Why would I want to leap? I 'm home. But you 're here to save the brothers, right? So? You got to turn yourself in. Right? So. Let 's go. Right? I ca n't. Eh-How did I know he was gon na say that? I ca n't have been put here to save their lives and then leave ' em with nothing, Al. I mean, their farm is all they got. But Ziggy says- Oh, forget about Ziggy. Forget about Ziggy. Al. My dad worked our farm 16 hours a day, seven days a week. It was his life. And when-And when they took it away from him-Well, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah, but you were n't even there. Exactly. I was n't... even there. Maybe I could have... helped him save what he worked so hard to build, but I was n't there. I 've had to carry that around with me my whole life. I do n't want Willie to have to do the same thing. Okay. If you had it to do over again, you 'd do things differently. But it 's a little late, is n't it? Is it? See, that 's what I 'm thinking, Al. Maybe I 've been put here to have a second chance. A second chance? Yeah. I mean, it 's pretty clear that... Vernon 's motives, not to mention his methods, are suspect, right? So? What if we can prove that Vernon manipulated the loans? You said Neil was n't on top of things. What if we can prove that he took advantage of Neil and the others... to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be awesome, except the mall wo n't be built for another two years. Well, there 's got to be some way we can link him up with the deal, you know? L - I just ca n't walk away again, Al. Okay. I 've got to try. Okay. I will go back and-and try and get Ziggy to come up with something. Thanks. I better - I better get back out there. Who knows, you know? I mean, maybe, um- maybe if this all works out okay, and I do n't leap right away, um, maybe I could go see my family. Could I have your attention, please? I know this is n't exactly how you planned on spending your holidays, but... I just want you to know that my brothers and I... have no intention ofletting any of you get hurt. Mr. Vernon 's on his way, and hopefully we 'll get everything settled, and we can all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want me to do? Uh, you should keep an eye on the front door. Right. Hey! Stay away from the window. We should n't have brought him. Why? He 's got just as much at stake as anybody else. Hey now, what was you saying before about Vernon wanting our land? I think he knew that we could never make those payments when he made us the loan. He set us up. You mean me, do n't ya? No. I did n't say that. Yeah. You did n't have to. I do n't mean to tell ya how you do your bank robbing ', but would you mind pointing that peashooter you got in a different direction? Yeah. I'm- I 'm sorry, Mr. Pierce. Mr. Pierce. Mr. And Mrs. Pierce. You folks had that dairy farm just a couple miles from-You 've lived around here for a long time, have n't ya? 54 years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been married 55 years. That 's great. Listen, uh, do you by any chance know, uh, the Beckett family? John Beckett? Oh, yeah. Everybody in this part of the county knows John and Thelma Beckett. Fine family. One of their boys just came back from Vietnam. Tom. Uh, his name is Tom. Um, when was the last time you saw Mr. Beckett? Uh, let 's see. I ran into him at Benning 's Hardware store just two days ago. How 'd he look? Same as usual. I remember one time, uh, Stan was away, and I took sick, and John drove me to the doctor, waited over an hour, and then he drove me home. He 's a fine man. Yes, he is. You know my sister. Mandy Greer? She was in your history class. You must remember. She had long, red hair and braces. Patch over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the high school production of Peter Pan. She played Captain... Hook. Gee, that was a long time ago. How 's she doin '? She got her braces off. Oh. She still wears the patch. I see. Well-Oh. I 'm really sorry that you got mixed up in all of this. That 's all right. My daddy lost his place a while back. The way I see it, Gus Vernon has it coming. Beth! Well, he does. I do n't know why you 're always protecting that man. Because he is our boss, that 's why. We would n't have a job if it was n't for him. Oh. Some job. Two dollars an hour, no benefits... and you. I should 've never quit the Dairy Queen. If you ask me, that 's where you belong. At least I do n't have to sleep with the boss to keep my job. - You little bitch. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, please. Please. Just-Oh! You all right? Baby 's kickin '. You know, we do n't need to keep you here with us. We can just go ahead and let you go. Nobody 's going anywhere! She 's pregnant, okay? That 's why she 's here. Mundy 's not gon na make a move as long as she stays here. If we let her go, he 'll see we 're willing to deal. He 'll also see that we 're weak. You 're losing sight of your objectives here. Use your head. What is that supposed to mean? Willie! Vernon 's here. Look at him. Crisp as a hundred dollar bill. - Excuse me. - It was about time you got here. What the hell 's going on, Clyde? One minute I 'm doing business, the next I hear my bank 's being robbed. Well, first of all, your bank is n't being robbed. It 's being occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to the town. I did n't drive 30 miles to get a lesson in semantics. Now, who 's in there? Bill Walters 's boys. Who? Is it that easy to forget? Mary, what are you doing here? There 's a law against a mother wanting to be near her children? What 's this all about? - Murder. - Murder? - Who 's been murdered? - A way of life. Mary, look. We all know, uh, how hard it 's been for you since you lost Bill, but this is n't gon na bring him back. Now do your boys a favor. - Tell them to come on out. - No, sir. - They are breaking the law. - What would you know about the law? And you, Clyde Mundy, ought to be ashamed siding with his type. I am trying to do my job. When does your job include running with the devil? I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na listen. We 're not the first to go under here. And we wo n't be the last. Now, I was born in this county. Most of these folk here were. And I 'll be damned if I 'm gon na sit here and let the likes of you... steal it out from under us. No, sir. My boys stay right where they are. And they stay there with my blessing. Why the hell does n't he call? - Just give him some time. - You do n't think they 'll try anything funny? I say we fire off a couple rounds. Let ' em know we 're still here. Give me this. Hey, give it back. I 'll give it to you later. Hey, I 'm still the oldest in this family. Then why do n't you start acting like it? You 're so full of yourself, are n't you? Big college boy. Come home and fix everything. Neil, do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart one. Leave him outta this. What 's it feel like to know everything about everything? This is n't the time or the place. Why, you going somewhere? Yeah. I 'm gon na let you cool off. Neil, come on. Oh, that 's it. Run away! You 're good at that, are n't you? I wonder if Pop might not still be alive if you had n't took off the way you did. That 's enough. That man lived for you. John and I were his sons, but you were his life. And when he needed you most, you were n't even there. I did n't know. Did n't know or did n't care. Do n't ever say that again. After only a few hours, it was obvious that my life and Willie 's had taken similar paths. It was also becoming clear that the line separating us was beginning to blur. Still, I knew these people, and it felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ya doin '? Okay. Kind of a long day, huh? Yeah. You scared? What? Just want to know if you 're scared. No. Are you? Yeah. I 'm scared. Look, I 'm sorry about what happened before. I should n't have hit him. You know, I just, uh - I lost it. It? My temper. This is all kind of sudden for me. He - He did n't mean what he said. Well, sure sounded like it to me. It-It has n't been easy for him since Pop died. If I tell you something, will you promise not to repeat it to anyone? Uh, sure. A few weeks ago we were working on the tractor. All of a sudden, Neil hops off and tells me to get in the truck. Next thing I know, we 're at Pop 's grave. Must 've spent two hours just sittin ' there. Just sittin ' there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All of a sudden, Neil starts talkin ' about you. ' Bout- ' Bout-'Bout how much he admired you. How proud he was that you were making something of yourself. And he said, uh, that you were too smart to get trapped like he did. That life was too short to spend it miserable... and full of regret. And... then he- he cried. Sam? Look, I 'm gon na go stretch my legs. Can I get you something? You need anything? Kathy Campbell 's phone number. Willie? I lied. I am scared. Seems pretty calm out there right now. Yeah. Like right before a tornado. Did Ziggy come up with anything? Uh, well, there was nothing ever officially registered between Vernon and the developer. Nada. He 's too smart for that. Yeah. And if there 's anything linking him to the deal, he 's keeping it pretty close to the vest. You think maybe in his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All right. I got to get out of here then. Now wait. There 's a deputy guarding the back entrance, but Ziggy 's been running some escape scenarios. She says your best shot is to create some kind of diversion. Diversion? Al, take a look around. I 'm stuck in this bank. How am I gon na create a diversion? Are you gon na be much longer? Let me get this straight. You want me to go out the door, and when I get in the middle of the street, pretend to go into labor? That 's right. Does n't sound too difficult. Wait a second.! You 're not really going to do this? You sure that Vernon 's guilty? Positive. It 's just gon na take more than my word to prove it. Do n't you see what he 's doing? He 's just trying to use you to get away. Do n't be stupid. This really bothers you, does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't shoot.! I 'm coming out.! Come on, Beth. It 's all right, hon. Come on. Now, Beth? - Come on across the street, hon. - Okay, baby. Showtime. Come on. Come on, honey. Ow! What 's she doing? I think she 's gon na have a baby. My baby.! My baby.! Come on. Come on, come on. Well, go. Go, go, go! Okay, Sam. He 's gone. Ow, ow, ow.! What now? What now? Get out of here. Go down the alley, turn around the corner, go north. Vernon 's house is about a mile out of town. Hurry up! I 'm okay. I 'll be okay. Do you think he got away? How the hell should I know? I did n't hear any gunshots. Well, I do n't want to hear anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on, Sam. Hurry up. Sam, hurry up! Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up. It 's not far. It 's just another hundred yards or so. You can almost see it right down the road. Come on. I 'm out of shape, Al. Next leap, maybe you 'll leap into Carl Lewis. Right now you got ta suck it up. Now come on. You gon na make it? I do n't have much left. How far-Churchdale Road. I remember this place. My-My folks ' farm-It 's just, uh, 10 miles down that road. Well, nobody could blame ya if you kept going. What about Neil and John? What about all the other families Vernon 's taken advantage of? You think they 'd understand? Well, I- I did n't say it 'd be easy. Need a lift, fella? No thanks. Sam, look out for that- that, uh, pile of newspapers. That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cat burglar. Wow. Looks like the housekeeper took the year off here. Yeah. Vernon probably repossessed her cleaning equipment or something. Did you know this Vernon when you were here before? Uh, well, he was a couple years ahead of my brother in high school. He ran for class president, I think. Did he win? Uh, no. As I remember, he was disqualified. Something about stuffing the ballot box or something. Oh, he was stuffing the ballot box. Well, at least he 's consistent. What are we looking for? Someplace you would hide valuables, you know? A - A safe. A wall safe. A filing cabinet or some drawers-A strongbox with a lock the size of Maine? Okay, uh - A letter opener or a file or something. How about the key? I 'll, uh, take the gun, please. Careful. What are you doing here? You have n't changed since high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know about what I was like in high school? Why 'd you do it? How could you steal all those people 's land? What you call stealing, I call business. I guess that makes it a little easier to sleep at night. I saw an opportunity, so I took it. What a nozzle! I 'd like to grab his Adam 's apple and pull it out through his nostrils. Most of the farms were so far under, they could n't see the light of day. So you put them out of their misery? Nobody forced anyone to do anything he did n't want to do. You intimidated them, and then you stole their lives out from under them, all so you could turn a profit. Yeah? Well, you ca n't prove that, can you? No, I ca n't. But I 'll bet there 's plenty of proof in here. You 're crazy. Am I? Why do n't we open this and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you what I am gon na do though. I 'm gon na call Chief Mundy and tell him... that I just killed me an intruder. I was wrong. You have changed. What are you doing? Sam, what are you doing? Go ahead, shoot me in the back. It 's more your style, is n't it? No. I would n't do that, Sam. It 's not a good idea. You know, you made a big mistake coming back home. You should 've stayed away. That makes two of us. Ow! What, what, what? What is it? What is it? A letter of intent from the developer. Ah, bingo! All you have to do now is get that back to Mundy, so we can get this over with. Right. I 'm all for that. You did n't see anything else? All I remember is turning around and seeing Carl Wilkens. Next thing you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shot one of my boys? Clyde, you 've got to do something. What 's that? Who 's that there? Willie. Willie? You keep Mary here. Hold it right there, Willie. Drop the gun. Right now. Chief, this is n't necessary. Humor me. Look, I have evidence that Gus Vernon manipulated, intentionally, the farm loans in order to sell off the land. Is he? Oh, no. He 's just resting. I want you to look at this. What is it? It 's an agreement between Gus Vernon and a private developer to build on the foreclosed land. And it was signed six months before the first farm went under. Where 'd you get this? Vernon 's house. Looks like you 've got enough here to put Gus away for a long while. That 's great. Let me tell my brothers. We can end this. We 've got a bigger problem now. There 's been a shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his own hands, busted into the bank and there were shots fired. Sam, no, it 's John. He 's been shot. He 's hurt bad. You better get in there quick. Sheriff, I 've got to go talk to my brother. We 've been tryin ' to, but they do n't answer. - The state boys are gettin'ready to go in. - You 've got to get in there. Hurry up! If you let me talk to them, I can get them to come out. I do n't know. You said yourself that might be enough evidence to convict Vernon. Now let me go tell Neil. He does n't want to hurt anybody. Please, Chief? Please. What do you got to lose? All right. Five minutes, or they 'll start moving in. Go! Go! You. You killed him. This is all your fault. He was n't gon na hurt anybody. He 's just a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's me. Do n't shoot. It 's just-It 's just me. Willie. Yeah. I did n't think you were coming back. I really messed up this time, did n't I? It 's okay. We 're gon na take care of everything, all right? He 's alive. - We have to get him to the hospital. - I did n't mean for this to happen. He came out of nowhere. I thought he was gon na kill John. John. Oh, my God. What did I do? - Neil, this has got ta end. - Well, what about Vernon? We ca n't let him get away! He 's not gon na get away. I got the proof that we needed to get the loan reviewed. You 're gon na get the farm back, but there are people waiting for us to come out first. You did it, did n't you? You saved us again. Pop would be so proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. L - I never could be what he wanted. I never could be you. Neil, it 's all right. I tried to do the right things. I never wanted to be head of the family. I 've ruined... everything he built. You did your best. How? By losing a farm? No. By being there when he needed you. Do n't you see? In the end, it was n't my face he saw. It was yours. And no matter what happens to me, no matter what I do for the rest of my life, I can never change that. That moment belongs to you. I loved that old man. I should 've told him. You just did. Now come on. Let 's get him out of here. Is he gon na be okay? Oh, sure. Yeah, he and Wilkens are both gon na be just fine. Vernon? Uh, Vernon is convicted ofbank fraud, and he serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the good part. The state banking commission reviews the loans that he made, and then they rescind the foreclosure proceedings. What about the brothers? John and Willie are convicted of illegal entry, but thejudge takes things into consideration, and he lets them off with probation. Uh, Neil is convicted... of aggravated assault, so he serves a term of five years. Then after he 's released, he just drifts around the country doing odd jobs... until, uh- " Until, uh, " what? Until he's-he 's shot in an alley in New Orleans in ' 77. It 's a robbery, and he gets killed. Are you saying that I leaped in here and saved his life just so he could be murdered? Well, Sam, they - they ca n't all be happy endings. And there 's nothing I can do? Well, if you want to hang around here for another six years-I wish I never would have stopped. Why should I even stop? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're leaping around in time fixing things. It-It 's just supposed to be. I just wish this whole thing never would-Okay, John. Dad. Sam. Sam.! Dad? Dad, wait a minute. Wai-You 're real. You 're alive, and you 're real. Well, I believe that 's true. Uh, do I know you? Know me? Of course, you know me. I 'm your so- No, no, Sam.! No, he ca n't see you. All he can see is Willie. I 'm Willie Walters. Bill Walters 's boy? That 's right. I have n't seen you since the funeral. Your father was a good man. He was the best. How 's your mother? She 's good. She wanted me to give you a message though. Message? Yeah, she, uh- she wanted me to wish you a merry Christmas. Well, Merry Christmas to you too, son. Merry Christmas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here.! Dad, you 're home! Well, it 's about time. Arriving passenger Martin Elroy, please report to the courtesy desk. - Martin Elroy. - What 's that about? What 's what about? They just paged you. Oh. Well, I guess I was so excited to see everybody, I did n't hear. Well, we 'll get your bags and meet you at the curb. But do n't take too long. I 've got a pot roast in the oven and something special for dessert. Come on. Welcome, Daddy. Hi. Just a moment, please. You, uh - Huh? Kids? It 's my turn. Here he is now! Oh, Daddy! Oh, I missed you, Daddy. Surprise.! I missed you, Daddy. Oh, boy.
