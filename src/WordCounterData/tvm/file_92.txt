KAPLAN : Looking for something, boys? Uh, no, no. Mr. Kaplan, we were just... I was just looking for my guitar. Yeah. He likes to check his instruments before he performs. Oh, really?

Depart! Ready? I ca n't wait. It 's going to be great. It 's going to be cool. RITA : Finster? Finster! Yes, my Queen. Goldar and Fang are about to attack but Tommy could ruin everything. What are you going to do? We would n't want him to do that. I shall send the Putty Patrol. So you want to play, huh? I can use the practice before the show. Give me the communicator back. Look, I 'm done fooling around. Huh? Let me out of here! Putty come on. You just wait. Come on, let me out of here. I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a little peckish myself. Look! There 's some eggs.

Something 's wrong.( beeping) We read you, Zordon. Teleport to the Command Center immediately. We 're on our way. Zordon, Tommy does n't answer his communicator. That is why you 're here. Observe the Viewing Globe. He is being held hostage by Rita 's Putty Patrol. Oh, no, Tommy. He 's really in a bind. We got to help him. Not so fast, Zack. We have another problem. Rita has released a garling Fang monster who intends to destroy the earth. Man! Now he 's ugly. Precisely. An absolutely atrocious beast. But, Zordon should n't we help Tommy first? He is capable of handling his situation. First, you must destroy fang before he unleashes his power. It 's Morphin Time. Mastodon! Pterodactyl! Triceratops! Saber-toothed Tiger!
