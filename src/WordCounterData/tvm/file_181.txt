LlLAH : It 's just business. - Do n't come at me through Cordelia. GUNN : Hey, Fred. - Sorry. Did I startle you guys? - No. Only in the sense of shocking and jolting us. What 's up? Nothing, just taking a little stroll. Why do girls want to look like that? I was in a cave starving. What 's their excuse? Fashion. So everybody 's just reading and hanging out? - Angel 's upstairs. - Oh. He 's probably reading too. He 's so deep, you know? Thoughtful. I 'm guessing The Brothers Karamazov, Joyce, a little Goethe to round it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what? Charlton Heston double feature. At the Nuart? - Soylent Green and The Omega Man. - Wow. It 's two for one. Did I mention Charlton Heston? - Who 's in? - That sounds great. Fred. Wesley? I ' m translating Fassad 's Guide from Sumerian. Gunn? Cordy? Looks like it 's just you and me, Fred. Well, the worm certainly has turned. Yeah, the worm 's turning and.... Am I the worm? Friends and coworkers have accused me of being the stay-at-home, sulky one. Some people just do n't know how to have fun anymore. ESCORT : Can we take a breather, stud? WOODY : If you need one. Hey, tiger. Me too, just for a minute. Pace yourself, sweetheart. It 's good to be young. So, ready for round four? [GROANS] You okay, baby? It 's been fun.

And he 's lonely because he 's the last man on Earth. - Angel? - Charlton Heston, The Omega Man. Omega being the last letter of the Greek alphabet. He walks on the street side.

No, that 's never happened to me. CORDELlA : You need to talk to Fred. - What about? - About the big date you had last night. - Date? It was a movie. - That 's what you need to tell her. She 's in there going on and on about what a super time you guys had. She 's just enthusiastic. Do n't read too much into it. She 's got the big puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're handsome and brave and heroic emotionally stunted, erratic, prone to evil and a eunuch. How can you - -? I 'm not a eunuch. - It 's a figure of speech. - Find a better one. I just mean sex is a no-no because of this " if you know perfect bliss, you 'll turn evil " curse. Really no cure for that, huh? All I 'm telling you is this thing with Fred will go bad... -... unless it 's nipped in the bud. - Okay. - Maybe just a short talk. - Okay. - So how soon can you do that? - Nice try. It 's got ta come from you. Angel has something to say. Did anybody else see this? " Police found the body of Woodrow Raglan in an Elondria Hotel suite.

But give me time. You 'll see I 'm a creative guy. Like tormenting Angel with building code violations? So Machiavellian. We 'll drown him in red tape. There are other levels to this. Avenues of interest I have. One of them being : Does Angel even exist? - Are you getting metaphysical? - No. He has no Social Security number, taxpayer I. D. or last name. How can he go to the Building Department or anywhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maze. Do n't you wan na see what he 'll do? - He might just rip out your throat. - You think he 'd be that clich���? d? Maybe you do n't know him as well as you think. Get Carter Williams on the phone. The graphic artist. Look under F for forger. There was a third victim five weeks ago. They were all young, healthy males who died in expensive hotel suites. Imagine spending money for a suite, then you ' re a big bag of mush bones? I guess it would n't be good wherever that happened. Please continue. Gunn, interview staff at the hotels where they died. I ' m meeting a contact from the coroner 's office in 30 minutes. They were members of the same health club. The bodies. When they were n't dead. - We 'll go to the gym. - My thought exactly. - I 'll drive. - What are we waiting for? Everybody know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. Okay, I 'll do that.

I need to ask you, Phil, does the club condone steroid use? - No. Absolutely not. - Then let 's keep this between us. I 'll look at their records and get out of your hair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. So did you ever see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Or maybe green and scaly? Nothing connects the three, except they were in Pilates together. Pilates? Is that like T aeBo?

Well, I do n't see any harm in looking. It 's about all I can do anymore. - What is it you want? - Your help. Wondering if you 'd seen these men across the way in the gym. No, do n't think so. I 'm more of a girl-watcher, know what I 'm saying? Jeez. They all died? How? - That 's what we 're trying to find out. - You work with police? I 'm a private investigator. I work with a team. Sounds nice. I was a salesman. Worked alone for 50 years. Nothian herb jar. That 's a pretty exotic item. Did you deal in the occult? Occult, shmoccult. I traveled a lot, picked up some trinkets. Do a lot of bungee-jumping, Mr. Roscoe? - More than you might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll remember that. [SPEAKS_in_foreign_LANGUAGE] You might wan na think twice about casting a -- You are me. FAKE ANGEL : That 's gon na smart later. CORDELlA : Hello? FAKE ANGEL : Hello. So, what did you find at the old folks ' home? Nothing. Did n't pan out. How about you?

All right! You and me, going back to the hotel. Nice. - Are you all right? - Honey, I 've never been better. Nice. You supposed to be back there? Ding, ding. Paying customers. Hello? - Slow night. CORDELlA : Yeah. Maybe Wes or Gunn found something. Wes or Gunn? They 're a great part of our investigating team working here with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have I ever told you you 're a very beautiful woman? Very funny. I know you never said anything that tacky or overt to Fred. But you ' re still gon na have that talk, whether you want to or not. - A talk with Fred? - Yes. Just keep it simple. One, you ' re not like other men. Two, there 's no room at work for romance. Romance with Fred? So I 'm a...? Obviously. Get some rest. See you tomorrow. [PHONE_rings] CORDELlA : You 've reached Angel Investigations. Leave a message. OLD ANGEL : Cordelia, are you there? Pick up. Angel, how 's my head? Hope you put ice on it. Sweet deal you got here. Love the hotel. And Cordelia.... - That 's how I spell W-O-M-A-N. - Where is she? You just worry about eating nice, soft food and staying out of Ryan 's way. Ryan? We just talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month. - You ' re not to be out of your room. - l ' m stretching my legs. RYAN : Who am I? You 're Ryan. At least you 're not having an episode. Marcus, you think you 're a 24-year-old stud or a famous skateboarder keep it to yourself unless you wan na wake up in restraints again. - Copy? - I know who I am. Then let 's get you back to beddy-bye. Angel. What happened? Hey, doll. I was working on the case. I must 've dozed off. - T oo tired to go up to your room? - My room? Right, which is upstairs. You know me. I was giving 1 00%. What did I do with that case file? - You gave it to me yesterday. - Must be getting old. Not until you have that talk with Fred.

I know. - Hey, how you doing? - All right. Well.... You? So we got ta talk. I got nothing against you personally. It 's just.... This will be harder than I thought. I do n't know how to spit this out. Angel. - Whatever it is, I 'm here for you. - Yeah, that may be the problem. I mean, whatever we had, whatever we did. I just think that we should keep that behind us. Start from scratch. You know, two men working side by side but, you know, none of that funny stuff. Shake on that? I guess. - All right, give me a hug. CORDELlA : Wesley, food 's here. WESLEY : Okay. - Wesley? - Yes? - Do you know where Fred is? - Up in her room. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I could eat a horse. GUNN : Breakfast burritos all around. - Thanks, bro. Keep the change on that. - Okay. - Get anything from the hotel? GUNN : Yeah, I did. These guys ran up huge bills, mostly alcohol. At least they went out partying. I got their phone bills. Is n't that illegal? I mean, do n't these guys deserve a little privacy? - What? - Why are you eating? - l ' m hungry. WESLEY : They called the same number. I checked it out. First Class Escorts, La Brea and 6th. Escorts? You mean hookers? I should interview them while the trail is hot. I 'll take this. You interview the hotel staff. GUNN : I figured it out. - I 'll interview the hookers. - Are there any men who are n't dogs? - Not very many. A woman is more than a piece of meat. I ' m sorry, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the coroner. I can see one of the bodies. Gunn can go with you. That was n't the kind of body I had in mind to see. We ' re going, we 're going. You know, that 's a great idea. I 'll just stay here hold the fort, keep an eye on the evidence. WOMAN : Okay, Mom. security GUARD : Let me get that. WOMAN : Thank you. security GUARD : There you go. WOMAN : Great. security GUARD : I 'll take it. WOMAN : Great, thank you. OLD MAN : Yeah. over there. Let 's go. MAN : Okay. - I got someone I want you to meet. - I ca n't right now.

Go up and put on something pretty, and we 'll go out on the town. - Really? - And that 's just for starters. Okay. I 'll be - - I 'll just go and-- Okay! [whistles] What can I do for you? Do n't go all night-stalker on me. I 'm here to do you a favor. We both agreed that business with Cordelia was just business, right? Sure. It 's all there : earthquake-safe certification statement of asbestos-level compliance, all of it. I ' m not playing you here. It 's not about you. It 's about Gavin. Thinks he 's so smart. You 're welcome. I 'm sorry. Thanks. That was a really thoughtful favor. How about a drink? Have I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security GUARD : What 's going on? Clear the floor! My heart. - Want another? LlLAH : I 'll have to call a taxi as it is. Oops. - What do you want? - You. Do n't tell me you never thought about it. [MOANS] [SCREAMS] LlLAH : Son of a bitch! Sorry, it felt like the thing to do. - Are you born-again? - I do n't know what game this is. But I hope you enjoyed it. You 'll never get this close to me again. What? This is new. What are - -? Ah. What the - -? RYAN : You 're awake. OLD ANGEL : It 's beating. - lt was your fourth heart attack. You ca n't survive another one. You got lucky. Try something like that again, you may not be. Julia Roberts ever makes a realistic movie about being an escort I think it should be called Pretty Skanky Woman. Angel? Fred? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should 've knocked. I always forget to knock because, you know, I did n't have a door for so long. He called me sweetheart. But it 's just an expression, is n't it? When a waitress calls you honey, it does n't mean you 're special. It 's just a word, right? Sweetheart. Is this about Angel? He talked to you, did n't he? This is all my fault. I told him to do that. You told him to make out with that woman on the desk? What? No. What woman? [disco_music_PLAYS] [christina_GlGGLES] My boyfriend 's probably looking for me. He could catch us at any moment. Sort of makes it more exciting, does n't it? Yeah. It does. boyfriend : Hey! - What the hell you think you 're doing? - He bit me! boyfriend : Freak! [SCREAMS] Nice! - Bring it on. That all you got? - What are you on? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't alive, which means I 'll never die. I 'll be young, handsome and strong forever. There 's just one thing I got ta do first. [FAKE_ANGEL_GlGGLES] I do n't believe it. On my desk? Well, it did used to be his. He was just kind of reclaiming it. WESLEY : How? By marking it? - This is n't like him. - This is totally like him. - Doing the dance with a cheap blond. - Brunette. She was a cheap brunette. - You 're right. This is n't like him. - So who was she? It does n't matter who she was. The question is, who is he? We 're all thinking it. - He 's Angelus again. - Who 's Angelus? The badass vamp Angel turns into. But then why is n't there a body here? That 's not what I meant. Why would Angel need to read about vampires? - He wouldn't. - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited uncharacteristic behavior before death. They were n't themselves. Angel 's infected by whatever got into them? Not whatever, whomever. At the gym, anything unusual happen to Angel? Not really. I was with him pretty much the whole time. Except when he went to the -- JACKSON : Hey. What are you doing out of bed? Are you trying to bust loose again? Damn, Marcus. You do n't quit, do you? You wan na have another heart attack? Look, I ca n't really explain this, but I need to get out of here. Just do n't turn me in. Not gon na have to. Your kid 's signing in at reception. OLD ANGEL : My kid? - Uh-huh. FAKE ANGEL : Have a good night. RYAN : Good night. Hi, Dad. [whistles] You finally found a body that wo n't burn out, huh? Looks like. Only one way you can keep it though, right? - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that. You sure? I do n't think you know what you 're getting into. I know. You do n't seem to know what you had. You were the worst vampire. Vampires do n't help people, moron, they kill them. - Here, let me show you. - You may have the attitude and power. But there 's one thing you do n't have and never will : friends. Four of them behind you with heavy things. He 's the one that 's been casting that spell. You 're Angel? With that cologne? I do n't think so. Do n't stake him. God, I love technology. Are you all right? I got ta pee. Did you see an Algurian conjuring orb? Could 've been glowing. In his room. On a shrine. I was right. Algurian body-switching spell. Keep an eye on him. Fred! He 's out. He 's out. Read this. [SPEAKS_in_foreign_LANGUAGE] It 's cool, Gunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjuring stone. - You ca n't take that! - You do n't deserve that body! - I was gon na say the same to you. I 'll tell you why you have a weak heart, Marcus. You never use it. You 're pathetic. You 're all path - -! You should try to keep a lid on that rage. It 's not healthy. [GROANS] RYAN : What 's going on? - Dad 's having a bad night. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. How 's your head? Sorry about all that. I gather I had it coming. Yes. I 've been meaning to talk to you about something. Uh-huh. Okay. Is this about how you 're not like other men what, with that curse and all? And how you 're really fond of me, but that 's as far as it goes? Uh.... Yeah. Cordelia explained it to me. She said you 'd probably just screw it up. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right. What? It 's like something out of Fitzgerald. The man who can have everything but love. Well, maybe in some ways, you 're better off, because love is.... Well, in a way, it 's everything. But it 's also heartache and disappointment. And those are good things to avoid. [FOOTSTEPS_echoing] Angel, Willow 's on the phone. She 's alive. Buffy 's alive
