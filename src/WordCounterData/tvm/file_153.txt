5239241 It just made sense to move in to my grandmother 's house. She wanted to re-create for our daughter the happy memories she had in this house. I was stunned to see Amelia sitting up in bed. Who is she talking to? I know I heard somebody, but there 's nobody there. Something was wrong in our house. I could feel awful, searing hatred. Who 's there? Something paranormal was in our house, but I never would have thought a member of my own family would be trying to harm me. Chris! Chris! She 's back! I grew up in a small city about 20 minutes east of L.A. called Whittier. I spent a lot of my time with my grandmother. She lived down the street from us. Hi, grandma. I 'd come in, and she 'd say... How are you, sugar pie? What you up to? Not much. Ooh, what are we making today? Your favorite pie. I loved my grandmother dearly. She was wonderful to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very warm... And loving and inviting. What do you think? Sorry, grandma. Got to go. Do n't you want some pie? I met Chris in July of 2008. Chris loved life. He had no fear about him and such strong confidence. Bye, grandma! The common cliche... It was just love at first sight. The minute I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one. Chris and I got very serious very quickly. But my happiness was cut short. My grandma had a stroke. And our family decided that she needed round-the-clock care that we could n't provide, so she had to go to a hospice facility. Chris and I spent as much time as we could visiting her and trying to keep her spirits up. What can I do for you, grandma? There was a day that she was really down and depressed. And she asked for her favorite blanket. The one grandpa got me... It 's on my bed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Before Chris left, I told him... Just go in through the back door. It 's always open. Chris works security, so he gave me a puzzled look. And I said, " she comes from the generation " where you leave your doors and your windows unlocked and open. " Sure enough, the door was open like they said. It was a creepy, dark house. And there 's all kind of antiques and sort that she had collected over the years. Damn it. All of a sudden, I got this really strange feeling, almost like somebody 's following me. I do n't see anything, so I shrug it off and think, " it 's just my imagination. Snap out of it. " I go into her bedroom... And see her blanket sitting there. I still feel this heaviness about me. I 'm a big guy. I 've been in the security field for about nine, ten years, so there 's not too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house had me creeped out. When I got back to the hospital, I guess obviously I looked like something was bothering me. What 's the matter? What happened? Nothing. I do n't know. It just seemed like there was somebody in the house. But obviously, there was nobody there. Mr. Security. I thought Chris was just reading too much into it. You 're my hero. My grandmother passed away. I was completely devastated. This was someone who I had spent so much of my life with, someone who raised me, and my best friend, and now she 's gone. Chris and I got married. We had a baby girl, and we named her Amelia. It just made sense for us to move in to my grandmother 's old house. The price was right. The house was a perfect size. It had a backyard. It was everything we were looking for and an added bonus to me to be in the warmth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have made my grandma so happy. It made me feel closer to my grandmother, almost as if still a part of her was with me. There was a lot of unpacking to do, getting rid of old stuff that was in the house. Wait. It 's my guardian angel. We did n't get to all of it. We just kind of took a couple of boxes of paperwork, shoved them in the den closet. It 's nothing that 's that important. We hung pictures in our hallway of family : His family, my family, past generations. Mementos of, like, people that had passed on or... That we can see every time we walk through the hallway. - Well? - It looks great. See what your man did for you? " Rocky, I 'm afraid this joke may get Zeke in a whole mess of trouble. " Amelia had her own room. " Rocky laughed. I 'll just put this rock on a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third generation of my family to live in this house. " To find his first crowd of customers. " It gave me such a warm feeling. " They 're going to expect a ghost. Zeke has n't got anything but a rock and an old board. " " They 'll just run him over to jail. " It brought back memories of me when I was a little girl with my grandmother in the house. " After all, it was his mischief that started all this foolishness. " A few days later, we had put Amelia to bed. And welcome to Fact or Fiction. - I 'm your host... - I glanced over at the monitor. And I was stunned to see Amelia sitting up in bed. Welcome to our champion, bunny. She was having a conversation with someone. It 's my daddy. As you know, bunny has won... $17,380 dollars so far. Chris. Look at this. Who is she talking to? She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there next to the bed that she was talking to. Here 's our child sitting up in bed having a full conversation... With nothing. And then I hear another voice... Almost like a really faint... But you could hear it... Woman 's voice. And I 'm kind of like weirded out, like, " what 's... what the hell 's going on in here? " Like, " am I just... Am I hearing things? " Who is that? I start to freak out and, like, wonder, " who 's... who 's in her room? Did somebody break in? " I go over, and I start checking the windows to make sure that they 're locked and make sure nobody 's in there. Who you talking to, sweetie? To my friend. Who 's your friend? She shut down, did n't want to talk about it. For her to want to keep a secret was very unusual. Okay. I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor like a hawk. Good night. Good night. One night, Chris had gone to work. I went to take my contacts out, get ready for bed. I heard a very small, very light knock on the bathroom door. I thought, " meh. " Tried to brush it off. It sounded like a fist had pounded the door... Very forceful bang, very loud. I 'm home alone with my young child. I needed to check on her. I reached out, kind of shaking. I felt blind. Everything was blurry. There was no one outside the door. My daughter was looking very happy and peaceful in her bed. I heard what sounded like footsteps on the roof. The thing that really scared me was that somebody could be trying to break into our house. What would anybody want with us in our house? I called my husband immediately. I was talking probably a mile a minute. - Come home right now. - Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can. Just sit tight. When I get home, I grab my flashlight. And it 's so heavy, I can double it up as a weapon if I need to. Stay here. I 'm gon na go check outside. I walk down the run behind our bedroom and do n't see anything. It was dead quiet. But we 're just east of L.A., so there is always that possibility that we could have a break-in or anything of that nature. But there was nothing out there. So I kind of just said, you know, " hey, honey, " and just reassured her. Maybe she 's hearing new creaks and cracks of an old house. Smooch! I was n't sure what it was, but there was something threatening about the house. This was not the safe place that I remembered from my childhood. I decided we should maybe do something as a family, so I thought, " okay, let 's have a barbecue out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again. Chris is working a lot, and it was wonderful to have him home. And Amelia was having fun playing with her toys. It seemed like a perfect evening. Holy crap. What was that? What? I saw this figure, like a black, shadowy figure, like, pass by the kitchen, and then it was gone. You did n't see that? His face got really serious. You guys stay there. I 'm just gon na go inside for a second. I went into my room and grabbed my gun from the safe. I knew it was fully loaded. My heart 's racing, ' cause, you know, at any given moment, I can turn the corner and kind of see somebody. Amelia, come here. Come on. I feel like somebody 's on my heels... Like a heavy weight on me. I had heard a creaking noise coming from the kitchen. " What was that? " Who 's there? I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't shake the feeling there was somebody there. Is everything okay? Yeah, it 's nothing. I thought I saw something. But... it 's nothing. I was n't convinced. I know that if he thinks he saw something and he went to investigate it, there 's a reason behind it. He saw something, and he just was n't telling me. Later that evening, Chris had gone to work. I was trying to just relax and finish up some housework. I hear tapping on the window... As if fingernails were tapping. Nothing there, absolutely nothing. I hear this scratching on the outside of the house. The hair on my arms stood up. It sounded like the living room door slammed shut. I stood there really not wanting to go see what it was. Another bang... The kitchen door... The den door... And then another... And another... And then another. They did n't actually close. They just made the noise. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was following me. I felt something grip my shoulder. After what I had just experienced, I knew something was happening. Something paranormal was in our house. There 's definitely something or someone connected to this house. I was searching for any kind of reason as to what was happening to us. I started to think, " could it be somehow connected to my grandmother? " Available 3.6 liter v6 makes 295. In terms of fuel economy, Chrysler 's boasting up to... Is grandma still here? Maybe we had done something to upset her. What do you mean " here "? This was her house for so long. What the... Stay there. Amanda, you have to come see this. I could n't believe what I was looking at. This one picture came off the wall and landed in a very unnatural way. We were both completely at a loss. The nail 's still good. The picture would have had to have been lifted off to come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on and what was happening. I started to wonder, " maybe we should have moved somewhere else. " Maybe we should have moved somewhere to start fresh that neither one of us had any memories from. " Hey, Chris? Hey, Kevin. My boss asked me, " hey, you know "... What 's going on? I told him, you know, " I have some weird things going on in the house, a lot of things that I ca n't explain. " Neither of us can. Like what? Like fingernails scratching at the window, footsteps down the hall. And he said, you know, " well, maybe I can help you with that. " My wife, Lisa, she 's a psychic. I was dumbfounded, ' cause I did n't really so much as buy into, you know, psychics and mediums and things of that nature. Amanda, she 's frightened. We were desperate at this point. We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " let 's give it a shot. " Okay. I 'm a psychic medium. I specialize in exorcisms and cleansings. I 've been gifted since about four years of age. Hi, Amanda? I 'm Lisa. I did n't know what a psychic was except for the silly things you see on TV, and I did n't really know what to think, but I knew we needed something. They were a very sweet young couple. I could tell immediately they were very s they really needed help, and I really wanted to help them. She moved through the house as if she was taking photographs with her eyes and just kind of making observations. As I walked around the home, a pulse in my hand began to start. It got stronger and stronger, and it was leading me around. I got this very strong sense of history. Have you been living here long? No, just a few months. Well, that 's strange. I feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house. It was really odd, because we had n't given her any information. I was heading towards Amelia 's room. My hand started having a pulse. It 's like a Geiger counter. I was drawn to her little bed. And I pointed to a spot on the ground. Does she talk to someone there? I froze for a second. Yes. I remembered Amelia sitting up in bed having a conversation with someone we could n't see. All of a sudden, I could hear talking. I can hear her now. The presence was in the room with us. I could hear talking. I can hear her now. The presence was in the room with us. She 's very kind. " He said, ' I 'll just put this ' "... I like her presence. You could feel this good presence, and it was a very gentle, very kind, very nurturing voice. And then Lisa said that the spirit in this room was a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought and thought. " When she turned to leave the room, I heard Lisa say something. That started all this "... Sugar pie. Sugar pie. My heart stopped. What did you say? Sugar pie. I got very emotional. It 's my grandma. That 's what she called me. It was a wonderful feeling inside to think that this woman was now protecting my child. But it was very confusing. We had a guardian angel presence, but on the other hand, these terrible things had happened. The next room I went to was the den. You could feel this dark, horrible feeling. It was overwhelming. I was jolted and pushed back. I heard this very aggressive voice yelling and screaming. Get out of here! Lisa. Stop. I could feel that she was trapped. I could hear it. She 's angry. Stop it! I could see her dig her nails in and scratch and claw at the side of a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! She wanted out so desperately. She was literally in a hell. Lisa. Lisa! I looked at my hands, and I swear they were bleeding. Scratching. She wanted me to feel the pain that she was going through. What is going on? Lisa. I could feel a presence literally physically there. Lisa turned around and said, " you have human remains here. " Right behind my hand on this wall, there 's a box of human remains. In the closet. My jaw dropped. I could n't believe what I was hearing. I open up the closet door, and we have all sorts of boxes stored in there. No. She tells me, " keep looking. Keep going. " No. It 's that one, that one. It 's in there. This is it. It 's in there. My God. As soon as Chris took out the box, I realized what it was. Great-aunt Almarie. Almarie? Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I looked over at my wife, and she looked back at me, and, you know, she understood. Like, she understood what Lisa was talking about. Not everybody knew that my grandma had a twin sister. She lived out in Las Vegas, so I only saw her maybe once or twice a year. She had very long fingernails. Stop fidgeting. She was a very stern person, very difficult. Everything had to be her way or no way. Take the picture. When my uncle passed away, my grandmother had to bring her sister back home to take care of her there. The whole time she was there, she made my grandma miserable and would be very nasty. Homemade chicken soup. I do n't want it. T so. I do n't want it. It was very upsetting seeing my grandmother being treated in such a mean way. Get out of here! A few months after that, my great-aunt passed away. I never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family would be trying to harm me. I tried to explain to them the gravity of the situation. You need to get rid of these ashes to protect this family. Her great-aunt blamed them for her being in that box. She 's just begging to be out, and no one 's listening, so her only recourse is aggression. She 'd do anything to get out of that box, anything. What is going on? Lisa. I tried to explain to them the gravity of the situation. You need to get rid of these ashes to protect this family. Her great-aunt blamed them for her being in that box. If these remains were not removed, this family would never survive living there. Me and Amanda had talked about what to do with the ashes. I had figured that we 'd just leave them in the garage overnight, and then we would just figure out what to do with them in the morning. Ha-ha, that 's great, bunny. As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Chris had gone to work, and I was sitting on our bed watching a little TV. Thank you. Bunny, are you ready to meet that new challenger? Yeah, I really am. Okay, bunny. Let 's bring in that new mystery challenger. Well, hello. - Hi. - And your name? - My name 's Sable. - Sable. Sable... I hear fingernails tapping on our window. They were, " tap, tap, tap. " Sable 's from Harlem. Is n't that wonderful? I 'm gon na get me some money. So you can get out of Harlem, And you can see that she is very serious. All right, Sable, you know how our game is played. Yes. I watch it every day... And I looked out the window. Absolutely nothing. I was completely petrified. I knew that my great-aunt was back. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. And he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Yeah, I get him back to the car... Come on. Come on. Hey, babe. Chris! Chris! She 's back! What? Chris, come home, please! Okay. I 'll be there as soon as I can. Just... Amanda. Amanda. All of a sudden, the phone drops call. Chris? And the phone went dead. I was terrified, completely terrified. I could feel the most evil, terrible feeling. I hear this... The door had shut, almost as if somebody closed it. No. Amelia! No! The door would n't open. Trying to pull on the door and hit the door and kick the door. On the roof as if this spirit was trying to cave in my roof. Mommy! Mommy! No! Amelia! My daughter starts to cry, and I ca n't get out. I ca n't get to her. Mommy! No. Amelia! Mommy! Mommy! Amelia! Mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something was coming at me. I hear what sounds like footsteps. Something was coming at me. Quick, Amelia! I was petrified for Amelia. Mommy! Mommy! Leave my daughter alone! Stop messing with my family! I 'm just yelling at the top of my lungs, " leave my family alone. If you want to pick on somebody "... Pick on me! I 'm right here! We had to do something. We had to get rid of these ashes. They had to go... As far away from our house as possible. I knew what I wanted to do with my great-aunt 's ashes. I had a good idea of where I wanted to scatter her. She was always very happy at the casino. It was definitely a place that she loved to be. We just wanted this thing out of our house and wanted to move on with our lives. As her ashes were flying in the wind, you could feel the sense of relief. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Yeah. I did. I knew that now she would be at peace and be happy. When we arrived back home, there was such a sense of peace and calm in our house. Our house was no longer tormented by this negativity. My grandma had always looked out for me when I was little, and now it 's a great feeling knowing that my grandmother is also taking care of my daughter and my great-aunt was now at peace.
