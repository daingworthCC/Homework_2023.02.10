5241841 Captain 's Log, Stardate 46357.4. We have rendezvoused with the Starship Cairo near the Cardassian border for an urgent meeting with Vice-Admiral Nechayev. Come. May I present Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Admiral, welcome on board. Thank you. That 'll be all, Commander. Can I get you some coffee, tea...? Thank you, no, Captain. I 'm afraid there 's no time for the usual pleasantries. I 'm here to relieve you of command of the Enterprise. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before. The Cardassian forces which were recently withdrawn from the Bajoran sector have been redeployed along the Federation border. They have mobilized three divisions of ground troops and their subspace communications have been increased by 50%. We believe that they 're preparing for an incursion into Federation space. Are the Cardassians ready for a war? I did n't say " war, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence reports suggest that they 'll try to seize one of the disputed systems along the border. We think they 're gambling that the Federation wo n't actually go to war over one system. Will we? I hope we wo n't need to make that decision. We have decided to send the Enterprise to meet with a Cardassian representative and open talks. We 're hoping that the presence of the Federation flagship on the border will send a message to their leadership about just how seriously we view this situation. Where is Captain Picard? The Captain, your Chief Medical Officer and Security Chief have been reassigned. That 's all I can tell you for now. Do any of you know Edward Jellico? He is the commanding officer of the Cairo. I 've heard of him. I do n't know that any of us have ever... I 'm giving him command of the Enterprise this afternoon. Captain Jellico helped to negotiate the original armistice two years ago and I believe he 's the most qualified person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place at 1300 hours. Thank you. Admiral, with all due respect... it 's not necessary to give Captain Jellico command of the Enterprise just to conduct a negotiation. I disagree. The Enterprise will be in a dangerous situation and I want someone on the Bridge who has a great deal of experience with the Cardassians. No offense, Commander, but that 's not you. Halt! Computer, freeze program. You were five seconds slower that time. You increased the difficulty level, sir. Mr. Worf, It 's going to be far more difficult where we 're going. Which is where, exactly? I 'm sorry, I ca n't tell you that yet. It would be helpful to know something about our mission. Mr. Worf, I have my orders. I 'm sure you understand that. Now, Doctor, this deflector was n't set properly. It must be positioned so that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway or it 's useless. Sorry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Or maybe it was the falling rocks? I understand this is difficult. All I can do is ask you to trust me. All right, let 's do it again. All right, Mr. Worf I want you to time the Doctor and me through that first tunnel, and this time we 're going to pick up those five seconds. Welcome aboard, sir. I 'm Commander... William T. Riker, class of ' 57. Graduated eighth in his class. I 'm looking forward to serving with you, Commander. Thank you, and I, you. I 'm sure this change in command has taken everyone a little by surprise. Well... yes, sir. It caught me by surprise, too. I must admit, I miss the Cairo already but a Galaxy-class ship, that 's something special. I can understand why you turned down a ship of your own to remain aboard. Yes, sir. How many duty watches does the crew stand? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that to four starting tonight. I 'd also like to examine the duty roster and the crew evaluations as soon as possible. I want readiness reports from each department head by 1400 hours and a meeting of the senior staff at 1500. Do you prefer Will or William? Um, Will sir. Where are my quarters, Will? We have you assigned to cabin 735... - deck seven... - Deck seven. I 'll see you at 1300 hours. Attention to orders. " To Captain Jean-Luc Picard " Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise. " Stardate 46358.1. " You are hereby requested and required " to relinquish command of your vessel " to Captain Edward Jellico " Commanding Officer, USS Cairo " as of this date. " Signed, Vice-Admiral Alynna Nechayev Starfleet Command. " Computer, transfer all command codes to Captain Edward Jellico. Voice authorization : Picard-delta-five. Transfer complete. USS Enterprise now under command of Captain Edward Jellico. I relieve you, sir. I stand relieved. Dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do n't know. They do n't usually go through the ceremony if it 's just a temporary assignment. Sore? Oh... sore does n't begin to describe it. I know. I wish I could talk about it. Most of the secondary systems were changed at the last overhaul. I do n't think they 'll give you any problem but you might want to check out the port lateral... I 'll take care of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc. You do n't have to mother me. Uh... how 's your team shaping up? Very well... but I would prefer more recent intelligence on the exact layout of the installation. The most current information that we have is two years old. Two years? I do n't know how Nechayev ever talked you into this. She gave me no choice. Well, maybe there 's something we can do to help. We 'll launch a class-5 probe just before we reach the border. You could pick up the telemetry aboard the shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain. Captain. I believe we 're scheduled to arrive at the Cardassian border during delta shift. Please inform the delta tactical officer that I want to launch a class-5 probe just before we drop out of warp. I was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a little later, sir. Right now, gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and I will tell Lieutenant McDowell about the probe. Is there a problem with delta shift, Will? There is no delta shift yet, sir. I have spoken to the department heads about changing from three shifts to four and they assure me it 's going to cause us significant personnel problems. So you have not changed the watch rotation? I was going to explain this to you after the ceremony, sir. You will tell the department heads that as of now the Enterprise is on a four-shift rotation. I do n't want to talk about it. Get it done. Now that means that delta shift will be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to have it fully manned and ready when it does. Is that clear? Yes, sir. If you 'll excuse me, sir. Captain. He was your first officer for five years... One of the finest officers that I have ever served with. Of course he is, Jean-Luc. I 'm sure it 'll all work out. Captain 's Log, Stardate 46358.2. The Enterprise is on course for a rendezvous with the Cardassian ship Reklar. Fortunately, I still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead. I want you to install a bypass between the main phaser array and the secondary generators. I also want to run the main deflector pathway through the warp power grid and the auxiliary conduits through the lateral relays. Now, you may have to reconfigure the transfer interface. Sir, the transfer interface was not designed for that configuration. It will take seven hours to make those changes. Sir, you may not be aware that our normal interface already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of your current design system. It 's not good enough. If these negotiations fail we could find ourselves in a war zone and if that happens I want to be loaded for bear. I 'll get right on it. Good. Now, these stations should be devoted to damage-control and weapons status from now on. See that they 're manned at all times. Aye, sir. Mr. Data, how long before we reach the rendezvous point? We will arrive in 51 hours, 32 minutes, sir. Schedule four battle drills one for each shift. Run a series of simulated attacks from a Cardassian squadron. I want you to conduct the exercises personally, Will. Get it done. Oh... And get that fish out of the ready room. Data, you 're with me. The power transfer levels need to be upgraded by 20%. The efficiency of your warp coils is also unsatisfactory. Coil efficiency is well within specifications, Captain. I 'm not interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by at least 15%. 15 percent? That is an attainable goal but it will require realigning the warp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid off-line. Very good, Data. That 's exactly what I want you to do. If we take this grid off-line we 're going to have to shut down exobiology, the astrophysics lab and geological research. We 're not on a research mission. Get it done... in two days. I believe that is also an attainable goal. If we utilize the entire engineering department there should be sufficient manpower available to complete the task. Sure, if everybody works around the clock for the next two days. Then you 'd better get to it, Geordi. Looks like you have some work to do. Data. Yes? May I speak with you, Captain? Deanna, come in, come in. The latest masterpieces from my son. It 's an elephant... I think. Definitely an elephant. I 'm glad you 're here. I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be happy to, but, first I 'd like to talk about how the change in command is affecting the crew. I 've noticed some resistance. I would n't call it resistance. More like... uncertainty. Most of them had served under Captain Picard for several years. They knew him and they knew what he expected. Now they 're being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things and they 're uncertain how to react. I see your point. This all could be very unsettling to them. And to you. Perhaps everyone just needs time. Time for you to get to know and trust the crew, and time for them to understand how you want things done. I 'm glad you brought this to my attention, Deanna. Unfortunately, I do n't have time for a honeymoon with the crew. You 've clearly given this a lot of thought So I 'd like you to take charge of the morale situation. Please see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and easily. Oh, I have a meeting with the new security chief in five minutes so the duty roster will have to wait. Thank you, Counselor. By the way... I prefer a certain... formality on the Bridge. I 'd appreciate it if you wore a standard uniform when you 're on duty. Of course, sir. Commander, he 's asked me to completely reroute half the power systems on this ship change every duty roster realign the warp coils in two days and now he 's transferred a third of my crew to security. If it makes you feel any better, you 're not alone. Captain Jellico has made major changes in every department on the ship. Yeah, well, I do n't mind making changes and I do n't mind hard work but the man is n't giving me the time I need to do the work. Somebody 's got to get him to listen to reason. It 's not going to be me. He 's made that abundantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Talk to Captain Picard. Maybe he can do something. We just need a little time. All right. Come. You all right, sir? Yes, I am but the last time I had to train like this was for the Academy Marathon but... I 'm managing. What can I do for you? It 's nothing urgent. I 'm sorry I bothered you. Good night. My orders are to maintain radio silence until we 've completed the mission. Well, the Enterprise will be monitoring your channel just in case you do need to transmit a signal. Bridge to Captain Jellico. We 've arrived at the shuttle departure coordinates. Did you launch the probe I requested? Yes, sir. I was n't aware you wanted to be informed. Thank you. Jellico out. I can see why he 's still only a first officer. Captain, I would just like you to know that Commander Riker... I 've read your reports, Jean-Luc. I know you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He 's been decorated by Starfleet Command five times. He 's been offered his own ship more than once. I think if you just gave him a chance you would find him an outstanding officer. Jean-Luc, let 's be candid for a moment. The Cardassians are n't going to listen to reason and the Federation is n't going to give in to their demands and the chances are you wo n't be coming back from this mission of yours. I want this ship ready for action and I do n't have time to give Will Riker or anyone else a " chance. " And forgive me for being blunt, but the Enterprise is mine now. Well... here 's hoping you beat the odds. Good hunting. Thank you. Jean-Luc... I believe this is yours. Shuttlecraft Feynman to Enterprise. We have cleared the shuttle bay. Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck. Thank you, Enterprise. Well... now that we 're underway I can tell you about our mission. Starfleet Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, my God. I am not familiar with metagenics. They 're genetically engineered viruses that are designed to destroy entire ecosystems. When metagenic toxins are released into a planet 's atmosphere they immediately begin to mutate. They seek out and destroy all forms of DNA they encounter. In a few days, everything is dead. In a month, the metagenic agent itself breaks down and dissipates completely leaving every city, every road, every piece of equipment perfectly intact. Leaving the planet safe to be conquered. Would n't using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker as to the target? That 's why metagenics and other biological weapons were outlawed years ago. Even the Romulans have abided with those agreements. Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a new delivery system one that would protect them from accidental exposure to the toxin. They believe that the Cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspace carrier wave. So they could activate the toxins after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the subspace wave would appear simply as background radiation no one would realize what was happening until it was too late. Now, for the past few weeks, theta-band subspace emissions have been detected coming from Celtris III. These emissions may indicate that a metagenic delivery system is in operation. What do we know about Celtris III? Very little. It was thought to be uninhabited until these emissions were detected. Starfleet believes that the Cardassians may have a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet 's surface. Our orders are to penetrate this Celtris III installation and determine if the Cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon. And if they are? Destroy it... at any cost. When I was on the Stargazer we conducted extensive tests using theta-band carrier waves. One of the reasons I was selected for this mission is my familiarity with the methods used for generating them. Mr. Worf, your presence here is obvious. Doctor, your job will be to locate and to destroy any biotoxins we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How will we get there undetected? I... know a way of acquiring some discreet transport. Mr. Worf, set a course for Torman V. If he does n't pay up, I know three large Ferengi who will not be so forgiving. I did n't do it. We 're not accusing you of anything. What do you want then? We 're looking for DaiMon Solok. Why? We have a business proposition to discuss. Solok is a very busy, very important man. He is n't here. But I could relay a message. Good. Please, will you tell DaiMon Solok that we 're interested in transportation... to Celtris III? That 's a Cardassian planet. Uh-huh. Now, we understand that DaiMon Solok runs cargo there from time to time. Solok is no smuggler. Yes, but if Solok were to go to Celtris III for legitimate reasons we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey. I do n't think he would be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Solok was quite a man. Why... yes. He is a... extraordinary man. That 's why we came here because only Solok could help us... but I guess there are some things even Solok ca n't do. It 's too bad. Because... if he could, I would be... very... very... Yes? Grateful. When do you want to leave? Beverly, make sure that your tricorder is keeping a precise map of the route. It would be very easy to get lost in here. Right. I 'm picking up some subspace signals but I ca n't seem to get a lock on them. That 's typical of theta-band emissions. You have to compress the detection bandwidth in order to determine the fix. The source emission is 500 meters east of here, and... 700 meters below. It 's all right. They 're called lynars. They 're a kind of Celtran bat. They 're harmless. Bats? You 're not afraid of bats, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer 's Log supplemental. We have rendezvoused with the Cardassian ship Reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border. Gul Lemec has arrived. He 's waiting for you in the observation lounge. Very good. I 'll be in my ready room. Yes? Captain, I think there 's been a slight miscommunication. Did you want to meet with Gul Lemec in here? No, the observation lounge is appropriate. I see. Lemec is a Cardassian and Cardassians are like timber wolves... predators... bold in large numbers, cautious by themselves and with an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social gathering. So you 're trying to establish a dominant position by making him wait for you. The trouble with wolves is that sometimes in the fight for dominance one of them ends up dead. In that case, the trick is to be the wolf that 's still standing at the end. The floor is over 500 meters down from here. There does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rappel from here. This is sheer granite. We 'll have to use fusing pitons. We could try to find another way down. Unfortunately, that would take several hours. We do n't have the time. You 're not afraid of heights, are you, Doctor? Of course not. Now, remember to control your descent. Do n't get the lines tangled. I 'll remember. All right? What is going on? I 've been waiting here for over an hour... I 'm Captain Jellico. I believe you know Commander Riker and this is Lieutenant Commander Troi. Let 's get to it, shall we? This treatment is a deliberate insult to the Cardassian Union. I have been kept waiting here for over an hour. Then I 'm sure you 're ready to talk. I did not agree to allow others into this meeting. If it alarms you, I can ask them to leave. I am not alarmed, but we did not... A great many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't need to quibble over minutiae. I have come to negotiate a Federation withdrawal from the borders not to be dictated to by some mere Captain. I can see you 're not serious about these talks. If the Cardassian Union truly wishes to discuss peace they can send someone who can negotiate in a civilized manner. Captain on the Bridge. Let him stew for a few minutes. Then go in and tell him that you 've convinced me to meet with him one more time. Tell him I 'm a loose cannon and that he needs to be more reasonable because I 'm such an unreasonable man. Lemec will want to bring his own aides on board. Pretend to be worried that I 'll object, and then give grudging permission for two aides, no more. Understood? - Aye, sir. - Aye, sir. Well, I 'll say this for him... he 's sure of himself. No, he 's not. The installation should be about 300 meters... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to find another way to get back up there. I doubt it. That 's what I thought. Hmm... There 's a lava tube beyond here that runs for 75 meters. Then it connects with another chamber. We need to get through here. This tube opens up beyond this crack. If we could widen the opening then we should be able to crawl through. Mr. Worf? A phaser set at level 16 should suffice. Make it so. Well done, Mr. Worf. Gul Lemec. A pleasure. May I present my aides Glinn Corak and Glinn Tajor. Welcome aboard. For the past three weeks you 've been massing troops in staging areas assembling strike forces and pulling ships from their normal patrols. We will not stand for this clearly provocative behavior. I see the Federation spy network has again provided you with faulty information. We are conducting routine training operations nothing more. Then I 'm sure you wo n't mind if we send a few starships into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployments do not concern us. However, we are very concerned with your refusal to vacate those territories along the border which are clearly Cardassian. You gave up your claims on those territories when you signed the armistice. You could n't take those worlds by force, so you want us to give them to you at the bargaining table. Captain, please. We should listen to them. Gul Lemec, as you know the systems are still under negotiation by the terms of the treaty. Negotiations which we have pursued in good faith. Unfortunately, the Federation has not been as forthcoming. So, to speed up the process, you are preparing for war. We are preparing to defend ourselves. The Federation will not start a war. That has always been your position. However, I have heard reports that a small team from the Federation has already been sent into our territory. Of course, I do n't believe it. Such an attempt would almost certainly fail and even if it succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part. I do n't know what you 're talking about. Then there 's no need for worry. A brief recess would seem to be in order. Very well. Where is Captain Picard? Reassigned. Well, I hope his new assignment is not too dangerous. It would be a shame if something were to happen to such a, uh... such a noted officer. Yes... it would. Only a few more meters. Beverly, get out of there! Beverly! I have her. Are you all right? I think so. Next time, you try bringing up the rear. We 're nearly there. Can you continue? It looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I 'm picking up three proximity sensors around it. Sensor echo is established but the false image will only last a few minutes. The hatch is magnetically sealed but I believe I can bypass it. I ca n't get a scan from the other side of the hatch. It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and fire in short, controlled bursts. Ready. Now. There 's no one here. There 's no lab. It 's a trap. Come on! Captain! Let 's go. The Captain! No. There are five more of them heading this way from another tunnel. Come on. Now! Come on. Captain on the Bridge. What have you got, Will? I 'm not sure. We 're picking up a lot of coded messages from a Cardassian planet near the border. Which planet? Celtris III. Can you detect any theta-band subspace emissions coming from Celtris? There are some residual traces. It seems that there were emissions up until a few minutes ago. Open a secure channel to Admiral Nechayev. Priority two. Put it through to my ready room. Aye, sir. Captain? Those emissions you were so concerned about have just stopped. I 'd say one way or another our friends have finished their task. Have you heard from our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would very much like to see them again. So would I, Admiral. A challenge. You should prove an interesting challenge. Possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years. What do you want? Why, you, of course. Picard... Jean-Luc. Serial number... SP-937-215. Son of Maurice and Yvette Picard. Born in Labarre, France. Formerly, Captain of the Stargazer where you conducted extensive studies on theta-band subspace carrier waves. Do n't look so surprised. How could we have designed a lure for the Captain of the Federation flagship unless we knew something about his background? So you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here. Why? In this room, you do not ask questions. I ask them. You answer. If I am not satisfied with your answers you will die.
