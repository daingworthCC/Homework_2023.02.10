One dollar. Dunk the clown. Try again. One dollar. Ei, wait a minute. I just hit the target. Why did n't you fall in? Ah, fall in, hein? And drink up all this water and suffocate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That would be pretty funny, hein? - Sim. - I do n't think so. Homey do n't play that. Homey 's One-stop Carnival. Step right up. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. Are you a real clown? No, I 'm your daddy. That 's the clown. What can I do for you, little girl? Can you make me a balloon animal? Sure. How about a little doggy? - Sim. - Sim. Homey once had a little doggy just like this. His name was Pal-o-mine. Pet him. Pal-o-mine. P - A-L-O, mine. Used to love to play fetch the stick. Sim. Till one day a cop car came by and ran over his back legs. He ai n't no pal o ' mine no more. - Here you go. - You 're a stupid clown. Sim? One-stop Carnival. One-stop Carnival. Step right up. Step right up. Ei, clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. One dollar. Est? bem, she 's about... I 'd say... one fat bitch. Ei, he 's pretty good. Homey 's One-stop Carnival.

Where you stop, only Homey knows. - Round and round I spin your dumb ass. - Est? bem, Homey. - You better hang on tight, because you might not last. - Homey, now I am sick. - You said you want to go faster, hein? - No, Homey! Round and round you still must go to pay for your sins that kept Homey down so low. So how do you feel about yourself now? I feel dizzy and nauseous, Homey. Good. That 's the same way I felt after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Gather round. Pay careful attention, ladies and gentlemen... ' cause this puppet show has a certain message to it. I want you to meet Mr. Establishment. Say hello to the nice people. Hello, nice people. Now... tell the nice people how you 've tried to keep Homey down. Well, I 've structured society in such a way... that men like Homey face nearly impossible odds... of ever achieving any sort of educational opportunity. Therefore, they 're unable to obtain gainful employment... thus forcing them to turn to an alternate source of income. Sooner or later, they just end up in jail, just like Homey. That 's right. Now let 's show them how Homey gets back at Mr. Establishment. Shall we? Sure. Very good. So, what have we learned, if nothing else? Homey... do n't play that. Very good. Now take your bow. The end. One dollar. Uh, me and my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems. I guess it 's ' cause I have been under a lot of stress and... maybe I do harbor some misplaced anger, but... you know, I think most guys do go through this. Am I right, fellas? This ai n't The Oprah Winfrey Show? Excuse me. Ei! So they finally rented that place, hein? Been about two years. Sure hope that slumlord changed the carpet. It was so stink over there, I could taste it over here. Mm-hmm. Ah, by the way... I love what you did with those little milk crates... that little table you made. What 's that, art deco? Sim. Look at me rattling on and on like you know who I am. Hi, girl. I 'm Bonita Batrell. I 've been here all my life. I know everybody in this neighborhood. Mm-hmm. Sim, girl, there 's some fine people in this neighborhood. There 's a lot of trash too. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there goes Mavis and her kids. Mavis! Ei, I see you got the whole gang out there today, hein? Them kids look like a pack of rag muffins. Got ta wrap them up in newspaper to take them to Sunday school. Mmm, mm-mmm. You see that little one down there? That little one. No, the one down there with the snot in his nose. Mm-hmm. That 's my little godson, Chuckie. Ei, Chuckie. Ei, Chuckster. Ei, Chuckie wucky doodle. You gon na give your godmother a kiss? That 's a little crack addict in the making there. Honey, I 'm telling you. All them kids do is beg. " Give me, " " Loan me, " " Can you spare? " Every time you turn around. Neither one of them would ever say, " Here, dog. Here 's a bone. " Now, the mama, every time I open my door, she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour. She needs some bread. She needs some eggs. She need to take her ass to the supermarket. That 's what she needs to do. Girl, I just do n't understand people like that. ' Cause I 'm trying to better myself. That 's right. I 'm enrolled in the Robert Feon School of Beauty... and the Ace Truck Driving School. So I 'm gon na have something, you see? Ei! There go my home girl, Gretchen. Ei, Gretchen. Ei, girl. I 'm scared of you. You look good. Love what you did with your hair. Shake it, but do n't break it. But if you do, save Chuck a piece. That fool went and spent the baby 's diaper money to get her weave tightened. Girl, the baby was hollering like a banshee all night. I 'm telling you, I 'm glad I ai n't got to worry about that... ' cause I got me some Cherokee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no luxury item in my family. Matter of fact, when I was a girl... my hair was long and straight and black and thick. They used to call me Pocahontas. Then one day I was heating up some ham hocks, and my ponytail caught on fire. Ai n't never come back. Just do n't understan... Hein? Ah, ah, ah, him. That 's Mr. Washington down there. Sim, he 's like a father to me. Ei, Daddy Washington. It 's me, your little fuzzy-wuzzy. You lookin ' mighty spry today. Got some spring in your step. Mm-hmm. You 'd have some spring in your step too if you were sleeping with... the preacher 's 22-year-old daughter. Poor Mrs. Washington. She do n't know what to do with herself. All she do is sit around eating the government cheese and passing gas all day. Girl 's stomach done blown up so big, look like she got food poisoning or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip. But I ai n't one to gossip. If anyone asks you, you ai n't heard it from me. No, you have n't. Ah, ah, you got ta... Look at. There goes Miss Jenkins right there. Mm-hmm. That 's good old Mrs. Jenkins, honey. I dare somebody say something bad about Mrs. Jenkins. Do n't nobody better say nothing bad about Miss Jenkins, ' cause I 'll go crazy. That 's when I 'll lose it. Miss Jenkins is a sterling example of a human being. Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm. Ei, Miss Jenkins! She is something else, honey. Just do n't let her take her shoes off in your apartment. Feet smell like a dill pickle. Sim, there 's some nice people in this neighborhood. There 's some fine folks. You gon na like it just fine. You just do me a favor. You stay away from nosy, gossiping hens, and you be est? bem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Home Shopping Club 's coming on. See you later. You loved him in Police Academy One... Two, Three, Four... Five, Six and Seven. Now you can see him live on stage in a special evening of performance entitled... Michael Winslow : A One Man Show. David Ansen of Newsweek Magazine calls it " Spellbinding. " Clive Barnes of the Nova York Post says... " Winslow makes us listen ultimately to ourselves... and what we hear is quite ugly. " It 's a home run.! Do n't miss Michael Winslow this June at the Winter Garden Theater. The experience is sound-sational. This month on HBO. She 's loud, she 's ugly, she wears an overcoat... and she 's a screaming success. She 's Samantha Kinison. Sim, it 's great to be here tonight. I guess you can tell it 's my anniversary. That 's right. I 've been married for five years... to a man. I try not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage as being somewhat different, you know. I guess I just pictured something other than... some lazy slob laying around reading Playboys and drinking Black Label. " Morning, honey. Sure wish I could stick around waiting on you hand and foot... your all day, but one of us has got ta earn a living! " I tell you. Maybe next time I 'll consider marrying a little higher up on the food chain. Like maybe an amoeba or something. I 'm not bitter though. I love men. I have always loved men. I 'll never forget the first time I fell in love. I was about 18 years old, you know. I 'll never forget it. I was just waiting for the right man to come and sweep me right off my feet. Just sweep me off my feet. Not use me like a Ride at Disney World! But I still remember the first one. That 's right. Wrote a little song about him. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front row. How you doin '? I bet you 've been in love, sir. I bet you 've taken some young lady under your arm, sir. I bet you told her you loved her, and she believed you. I 'd like to sing a song that I wrote for my honey lamb. It goes something like this. You desgra? ad! You broke my heart! You said you loved me, you lying son of a bitch! You lame-ass! I never felt your! I never felt your! You 'll laugh, you 'll gas, you 'll burn in hell. Samantha Kinison. This month on HBO. And now it 's time for another visit with The Buttmans. Ooh, it 's cold out there. Buff? Honey, are you home? Hi, dear. I 'm just finishing up in the kitchen. - How was your day? - Ah, terrible. I 've got a splitting headache. Ah, whoo. Whoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack wide open. Ah, that 's awful. - Here. - Ah, thanks, hon. Let me massage your temples. Aw. - Was there anything in particular that bothered you today? I do n't know. It 's just that since I started losing my hair... it seems like the guys around the loading dock are laughing behind my back. Ah. And besides that, I split this pair of pants today... bending down to pick up a crate. - Look at that. - Ah, that 's awful. It must be a faulty pair. We should complain to the manufacturer. - You 're darn right. - Is there a label in there? Well, let 's see. They usually keep one around the, uh... Ah, what the hell. Another 20 bucks down the hole. - How was your day? - You know, the oddest thing happened. Remember that time we took the kids on the roller coaster ride... and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sim. It sounded like a hillbilly jug band or something. Well, on the way to school today... Jimmy stuck his head out the window, and I heard it again. Weird. Must be the kids. Must have forgot their keys again. Aw, how 's my little buddies? Whew. It 's cold out there. Talk about freezing your face off. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, muffin. - I brought the mail in. - Ah, thank you. How was school today? It was fine, exceptJimmy got in trouble ' cause he kept giving Miss Jenkins raspberries. - Did not! - You did too. - Not! Not! - You did too! Stop that. I 'll have none of that in my house. - And you, young man. What 's this on the back of your head? - What, Dad? - This. - Aw, they did it again? " Planet Uranus. " - What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Probably just some more of that asinine humor. You 're gon na have to learn just to turn the other cheek. Daddy? - Yes, pumpkin? - Daddy, can I get some, um, hair extensions? Ah, pumpkin, you need that like you need another hole in your head. Daddy, but the boys seem to like ' em. Well, those boys are just packing your head full of nonsense. I 'll get it. - Mrs. Buttman? - Yes. - Gas man. - We did n't call the gas man. Good God! It smells like foot and ass in this house. Whoo! Man! Uh, there 's been a report of a gas leak in the neighborhood... and, uh, judging from the smell of things, I think it 's coming from this house. - I do n't smell anything. Do you smell anything? - No, Ma. Not at all. You might want to check next door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Buttman. Look here, man, if y'all ai n't gon na light a match... invest in some incense. Whoo! - Everybody, come here. You 've got ta see this. - What? Ah, just come on. You 'll see. - Ooh! - Uau! - It 's a full moon. - A full moon. You know, sometimes I think the moon was madejust for us. - Mm-hmm. - Join us again next week... for more ass-backward antics with The Buttmans. Thank you very much. We had a lot of fun this season. We want everybody to have a fun and safe summer... - and we 'll see you in the fall. - Later. You can do what you wan na do In living color
