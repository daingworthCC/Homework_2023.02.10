5232341 - lt sure is cold here. - l know. If we 're lucky, maybe we 'll have a white Christmas. That 'd be kind of neat. - Hey, it was fun travelling with you. - You too. And thanks for listening to me. What else was I gon na do for 1 6 hours? Thanks a lot. Good luck, Steve. And I hope that, you know, you find her. Well, everybody 's got a real mom out there somewhere, right? Harry, go get the car. There 's our baby. Hey, I got ta go. That 's my mom. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - How are you? - Great. So over here is our entire skin care line. Now, the kits come pre-wrapped. The customers like it that way. Oh, and you remember what I told you about filling out the invoices? I think so. Always add everything up on the calculator first, - just to make sure the figures match. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Time to party. Diedre? Thanks for the opportunity. What the hell, it 's Christmas. Good morning, ladies. Brenda. Hi, guys. What are you doing here? What do you mean? I love this place. Besides, you 're the first one of my friends who 's had a real job. So is there anything that I can help you with today? Oh, please, listen to you. Come on, this is serious. Okay. Pretend like you 're showing us this jewellery so we can keep talking. All right, I really think you should take a look at these. Oh, very nice. You know, I 'm really starting to get worried about Steve. - Yeah, he 's been gone four days. - Nobody 's talked to him. His mom keeps calling my house. She 's totally freaked out. Maybe we should n't have let him go. - Kelly, what could we have done? - l know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss him. I do. I mean, especially around Christmas, you know? He 'd always buy me something really nice, even though we were n't going out. What if he never comes back? Look, guys, why do n't you come over tonight? Brandon and my dad are out buying a Christmas tree and we 'll all get together and do sort of a tree-trimming thing. You guys have n't bought your tree yet? There are only two days till Christmas. - We 've had ours for a week. - lt 's a family tradition. We always wait two days before Christmas. That way, you get the freshest tree. I mean, it 's a family tradition. We always wait until two days before Christmas. That way, we always get the freshest tree. Dad, these trees do n't look too healthy. You should have been here a week ago. We had lots of healthy trees. Look at this, the needles are brown. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We spray them with water every day, but there 's only so much you can do. The sun just wilts them. Come on. We 'll go somewhere else. You 're not gon na do better than here. It 's the same all over. - We 'll see. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do n't worry, we 'll get a great tree, you 'll see. It 's 90 degrees here. Yes, that 's right, you heard me, nine-oh. I mean, I 'm sitting here in my shorts. It is? It 's really snowing? You 're gon na have a white Christmas. Oh, that 's what I miss the most. Mom, I got ta go. That 's Jim and Brandon with the tree. Well, yes, of course, we still have Christmas trees here. I 'll call you later. Listen, give my love to Dad. Bye-bye. - Come on, Brandon, lift! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let me see. Easy, easy. Jim, what happened to the tree? I mean, it 's - - l think the word you 're looking for is " dead, " Mom. It 's not really dead, it 's just kind of wilted. What do you mean, wilted? I mean, could n't you find a green tree? Well, not in this heat. And not when you go to buy it two days before Christmas. Come on, it 's not really that bad. Yes, it is, Jim. I 'm sorry, but yes, it is that bad. Well, what do you want me to do about it? We should have gone back to my mother 's. Cindy, we did that last year. All of us crammed into your parents ' house. The trees are green and there 's snow on the ground. Honey, we live here now. We ca n't keep running back to Minneapolis every Christmas. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to eat in this heat? Let 's not get crazy now, Mom, okay? Look, come on. It 'll be a fine Christmas, you 'll see. We 've got to do something about this tree. Brandon, what are you doing? Brenda, you were n't supposed to see this. Why are you spray-painting our Christmas tree? - Well... - Oh, that 's looking much better. Yeah, hang a little tinsel on it, you wo n't be able to tell the difference. Well, Christmas in Beverly Hills. I mean, it 's not natural. I do n't know, it seemed pretty natural to the hordes of shoppers that were in the store today. Oh, how was the job? Exhausting. But I made some good sales. I might be able to actually buy you guys something nice this year. Oh, well, honey, it 's the thought that counts. You tell her, Mom. Yes, but good presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys understand the importance of the giving spirit of Christmastime. Well, frankly, I 'm having a hard time thinking about Christmas at all. It feels like the middle of August. Next year, we 'll get a fake one. Was that Cindy Walsh or Ebenezer Scrooge? Well, Mom 's just having a little trouble adjusting to Christmas here in sunny Southern California. You got ta admit, it does take some getting used to. So, what do you think? It 's the thought that counts. - You guys are so Christmassy. - What do you mean? The lights on the house, the big tree, all these old-fashioned ornaments that have probably been in your family for generations. Kelly, they were giving these away last year at Jack in the Box. is there something wrong with this tree? No. Why do you say that? I do n't know. It 's, like, kind of a funky colour. It just got warped by the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up and keep trimming. Still suffering a little geographic dislocation? I guess so. - We 'll get used to it. - Thought we had. Listen, why do n't we have a Minneapolis Christmas right here? We can invite all the kids ' friends over for Christmas Eve, - start a new tradition. - We could do that. Yeah, I bet a few of those kids out there would love to be part of a real family Christmas. Oh, my God, I do n't believe it! Oh, how cute. Those are from when we were little guys. I have n't seen those in years. " And the stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nick would soon be there. " Kelly, please, put those away. Cold apple cider. I 'll go for that. Thanks, Mom. Well, you guys just could n't wait to get up those stockings, huh? Busted. Well, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, everybody. You know, back in Minneapolis, we always had these huge Christmas Eve dinners. We 'd invite our whole family and friends and we 'd exchange gifts and sing carols. And they always ended up in this huge snowball fight out in the backyard. Well, anyway, we 're gon na skip the snowball fight this year, but in honour of our first Beverly Hills Christmas, I want to invite everyone to spend Christmas Eve here, with your families, and so we can begin a new tradition. Hey, come on, it 'll be fun. Well, I 'd love to Mrs. Walsh, but we 're all going skiing in Mammoth over Christmas. Oh, well, that 's terrific. What about you, Kelly? Well, for the first time since I can ever remember, my mom is going to make Christmas dinner at our house. We 're having it with David Silver and his dad. Really? Your mother 's cooking? I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, it 's weird. Oh, it 's wonderful. What about you, Dylan? I assume you 're gon na spend Christmas with us. Actually, I 'm gon na go and visit my dad. You are? I thought you were having dinner with us? Well, yeah, Bren, but I mean, my dad 's alone in jail and it is Christmas Eve. Of course, Dylan. I mean, of course, you have to be with him. Thank you, though, for the invite. Hey, wait a second. What about Steve? I knew somebody was missing. You guys, Steve went to find his mother. - What? - l thought his mother lived here. No. Supposedly, she lives somewhere in New Mexico. His real mother, that is. Steve 's adopted. I did n't know that. Yeah, she told him to go for it, if it 's what he had to do. Well, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most parents who give their kids up for adoption do n't necessarily wan na be found. Well, I guess that 's just something Steve will have to deal with. That is, of course, assuming he can find her. Brandon, I mean, does he even know her name? All I know is that my mother 's name was Karen Brown and I was born May 1 5th, 1 7 years ago. Are you sure it was this hospital? No, but it was this town. Then it was probably here. Can I see some identification, please? Yeah, sure. I do n't know how I 've gotten along this far without having a copy of my birth certificate. I 'll be right back. Dr. Rosen, Dr. Rosen, please call your office. is that it? - lt appears so. - Can I have it? I did n't realise you were under 1 8. Under the circumstances, I 'm going to have to request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record. - You ca n't be serious. - l 'm afraid so. Look, Sister. I 've travelled a long way to be here, by bus, okay? So why do n't we make one little exception to the rule. - And it 'll be our little secret, okay? - l 'm sorry. Come back after your parent has signed this form. If I knew who my real parent was, I would n't be here. Okay, suppose I made a little donation to your favourite charity. Yeah. I should 've known you guys are n't the types to go for bribes. Dr. Morgan, please report to Emergency. You can look at it. Dr. Patrick, report to Reception Area 2. But I ca n't let it leave this counter. Thank you, Sister. Believe me, he 'd be pleased.

You do n't mind if I write this down, do you? 5595 Navajo Trail. Merry Christmas, Sister. I wo n't forget you for this. Merry Christmas. Order 's up, Brandon! Come on, Nat, give me a break. Where 's your Christmas spirit, huh? It always goes south around cold burgers. - Come on, move, move. - Yeah. Well, sir, what can I get for you? How about a nice cup of java, on the house? On the house. That 'd be nice. I 'm kind of busted. Okay, sure. I 'm kind of hungry too. Let me see what I can do. Hey, Nat, do you think we can rustle something up for the old guy over there? I think he 's homeless and, you know, tomorrow 's Christmas. - Jeez, it 's already starting. - What are you talking about? Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve free dinners. But it looks like they 're starting to flood in early. Why did n't you tell me? You spend Christmas with your family. No, no way, forget it, I 'll be here. What time? Noon. But you do n't have to. Nat, what am I gon na do, abandon you on Christmas? - l 'll be here, all right? - Okay. So, what do I tell him? Get him the special. But that 's it, no substitutions. - Okay, Nat. - l got something to show you. - Here you go, sir. - Oh, thanks. - l got some food coming for you too. - Oh, it 'll be nice. I wear it every year. That 's great. I bet you make a great Santa Claus. What 's that supposed to mean? Saved by the bell. Order 's up. Come on, enough of this Christmas cheer. Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Okay. This is it. Wait a minute, this ca n't be it. 5595 Navajo Trail. But I 'm looking for a house. Oh, there used to be some houses there. But that was a long time ago. Could you just take me back to my hotel? - Do n't you go to Beverly High School? - No, I go to West Beverly. - Hey, chief. - Hey, Brandon. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - So, what can I do you for? - Maybe a slice of that peach pie. Sounds like trouble. The only time you come in here and eat pie is when you 're depressed. What 's the matter, Andrea, you miss school already? Do n't worry, we 'll be back at school in a week and the paper will still be there. - That 's not it, Brandon. - Well, then what is it? Oh, it 's all this Christmas stuff. Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Brandon. We do n't celebrate Hanukkah, either. My parents think it 's easier that way. You know, just kind of ignore both, as if that is remotely possible. Do n't feel left out. Why do n't you come over to my house? My mom makes a killer Christmas dinner. She 's dying for company. I ca n't. I promised my grandma I 'd go to the movies with her. She loves going on Christmas Eve. There are never any lines. - So bring her with you. - l do n't know. Christmas is n't exactly her kind of thing. You know what I mean? Excuse me. Brandon, have you seen my Santa outfit? Well, yeah, you were just showing it to me over here a second ago. I know. I brought it out, an order came up and I put it down. Now it 's gone. Nat, be real. Who would steal a Santa Claus outfit? Merry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Take one home to the little one. Merry Christmas. Okay, there you go. - How 's that? - Perfect. Thank you. You 're welcome. Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Here, Brenda, take care of this. I got ta kick this nut out of here. - Be nice. - Nice? After all, he is Santa Claus. Merry Christmas. I should send some of these designs home to my elves. Very funny. Would you mind leaving, please? Are n't you in need of some Christmas cheer? All I 'm in need of is a security guard to keep nutcases like you out of here. Now, goodbye. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Hello. - Hello. I 'm looking for Karen Brown, - or a relative of Karen Brown. - Who? Yeah, she gave birth to a son, a baby boy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number. Hello? Jerk. - Hello. - Hi, I 'm looking for Karen Brown, - or a relative of Karen Brown's. - Who? Yeah, she gave birth to a son about 1 7 years ago, a baby boy. Karen Brown or a relative of Karen Brown 's. She gave birth to a son about 1 7 years ago. - l do n't know about around here. - No, I did n't think you would. Well, you have yourself a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you too. - Here you go. - Oh, great, thank you. Dylan. I thought you had left. What, are you kidding? Without saying goodbye? Hey, is it totally unprofessional to kiss you at work? - Yes, it is. - Who cares? It 's Christmas. And where did you get this? Some crazy old Santa Claus outside was handing them out. - They 're probably poisoned. - Oh, now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what is the Christmas spirit, anyway? Go outside. People are shoving each other on the sidewalk. They 're fighting for parking spaces to go spend money that they do n't even have. For what? Everybody 's forgotten what it 's all about, if they even knew to begin with. Well, I have n't. No, I bet that you have n't. So merry Christmas, Bren. Should I open it now? - Yeah, whenever. - Now. Dylan, it 's beautiful. Where 's the other half? It 's right here, with me. Dylan, I love it. And I love you. I know. I love you too, Bren. I wish you did n't have to go. Yeah, well, I know we 've had our differences and they have been major, but I just ca n't stand the thought of my dad spending Christmas Eve alone in a jail. I could go with you. No. You got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the first time I 've seen him since he 's been in there and... Excuse me, miss? is this gon na go on sale the day after Christmas? Well, I do n't really know. Merry Christmas, Bren. You know, last year, I bought this gorgeous but outrageously expensive leather jacket here two days before Christmas. I come back a few days later only to notice that you have slashed all the prices 40 percent. Now, I do n't think that 's fair, do you? I would like to buy the blouse now. If I buy it now, I should get the sale price, because after Christmas, it 's gon na be on sale. Hello, I 'm looking for Karen Brown or a relative of Karen Brown. She gave birth to a baby boy 1 7 years ago. Who is this? What do you want? Someone who needs to talk to her. This is very important. ls she there? Hello? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They 're going to get stiff. - When? - Patience. Please. Who died and made you Julia Child? You have n't touched a spatula in ten years. - Oh, my God! - What? Damn. There goes the cream of carrot soup. You know, Kel, it makes me a little nervous to say this, but the way things are going with Mel, I may even start cooking more often. Good, I think you need the practise. But seriously, I think it 's important that you realise how, well, important Mel is becoming to me. And vice versa, I hope. I think, after six months, I 'm beginning to get the idea, Mom. You know, it 's really the first totally healthy relationship I can ever remember. And on top of everything else, there is still that passion. About life, I mean. Well, I 'm happy if you 're happy. Thank you, sweetie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you. How weird. Keep beating. Coming. - Merry Christmas. - Mel! How sweet. I 'm not expecting you for another few hours. I know, I know. I just came early to drop those off. They 're gorgeous. Come on, I want to put them in some water. - Jackie, wait. - What is it? I ca n't... I mean, David and I ca n't come tonight. What? Why? Well, it 's hard to explain. No, it 's not really. Sheila, David 's mom -- - Your wife. - My soon-to-be ex-wife. Anyway, it 's the first Christmas we 've been apart. She does n't want David to come here. She wants him home. Well, that 's understandable. But what about you? She wants me home too. Just for Christmas, because she 's depressed. Well, I can understand how she feels. Pretty terrible, really. You should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried. Frankly, Mel, I 'm finding it a little hard right now to sympathise with Sheila. - l 'm not asking you to. - Good. Because not only have I been knocking myself out here, trying to figure out how to make a Christmas dinner for all of us to enjoy together, but it also appears I 've been making a fool of myself for the last six months. Jackie, that 's not true. Now, we 're talking about one night. Yeah, sure, one night that just happens to be Christmas Eve. Mel, I took you seriously. I let down walls that have been up longer than I can remember. I talked to my daughter about us. I made up silly plans for us. - Oh, forget it. Here. - No. You want me to stare at these and think about you? - Jackie, you 're overreacting. - l do n't think so. Merry Christmas. My best to your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel so stupid. - Excuse me? - Yeah. is this your place? Well, yes, it is. I 'm the guy who called a little while ago. Oh, yeah? Well, I do n't wan na talk to you. Please, I need your help. I need to find Karen Brown. Just what are you after, kid? - Do you know her or not? - Yes, I know her! I 'm her father! I 'm her son. Well, then... Why do n't we go sit down? Hi, Brenda. - Kelly, what 's wrong? - Everything is a mess. You know that big dinner my mom and I were making for David and his dad? Your mom forgot to defrost the turkey. No. You 're not gon na believe this, but David 's dad came over and told my mom that he wants to spend Christmas with his wife. Oh, your poor mom. She likes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does. She does n't even want to talk to him now. Maybe if I buy her another present, she 'll feel better. You think? - Can I use your discount? - Sure. But do you really think that 's gon na help? I just - - l hate the thought of us spending Christmas Eve alone. I 'm afraid she 'll get all depressed and start drinking or something. Why do n't you two come over? Are you sure? I mean, it 's such short notice. - Who cares? We 'd love to have you. - Thanks. Hey, what are friends for at Christmastime? See you later. - Be there at 7. - Okay, we 'll bring dessert. My mom made this incredible chocolate mousse. You will not believe it. Hi, merry Christmas. - Been a good girl this year? - Unfortunately. - Have you? - Definitely. Ca n't fool Santa. I thought I asked you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun. The young ladies are in need of some Christmas cheer. Oh, well, I 'm sure you know just how to give it to them. Listen, why do n't you take your big white beard and your little red suit right across the street and cheer up the security guards over at Tiffany 's? Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Creep. Hi, I 'm here to see Emily Valentine. - And your name? - Brandon Walsh. Sign here and I 'll see if she 's in her room. Thanks. - Brandon! - Hi, Em. What are you doing here? I look a mess. No, you do n't. You look great. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Well, if you had any ideas I was crazy, I guess they 're confirmed now, huh? - l tried calling, you know. - l know. My doctor thought it was best I stay out of touch for a while. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you. Look, I just want to say I 'm sorry for all that stuff -- Emily, I did n't come here for that. This place has been really good for me. Some people have a lot of stuff in their heads they spend their whole lives not dealing with. I 'm gon na know myself really well by the time I leave this place. - When 's that gon na be? - Soon. I may actually even go home tomorrow for Christmas dinner. It 's going back to school that 's gon na be the real challenge. Maybe Andrea can write an article, " Nutcase Returns to West Beverly. " No, I do n't think so. Open it. Come on. Oh, my God! Your favourite shirt. Finally, it 's mine. Well, I figured if you wanted it that badly... - You 're not getting it back, you know. - Read the card. " Merry Christmas from all your good friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Steve, Andrea, Donna, David. " They all would have been here, except you have this ridiculously restrictive visitors policy. Thank you, Brandon. Hey, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I 'll get it. What are you doing here? Since I 'm not gon na see you tonight, I just wanted to give you your gift. And what makes you so sure I 'd want a present from you? It 's not my fault, Kelly. Do n't you think this is as bad for me as it is for you? - What do you mean? - Being caught in the middle like this. My mom using me as an excuse to get my dad over for Christmas? And how do you think we feel, David, being dumped on Christmas Eve? Look, I 'm sorry. I like your mom and I really wanted to spend Christmas with you guys. I thought you wanted your parents to get back together. Well, I do. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to see you and your mom get hurt. I 'm not my dad, you know. I know. Still friends? I guess. Wait a second, I have something for you. Do n't open that in front of your mom. - Why? - lt vibrates. - David - -! - l 'm just kidding! It 's a joke. I swear, I 'm just kidding. - My name 's Al. - l 'm Steve. I know your name. I helped name you. - You did? - l did. So does Karen, my mom, does she live around here? Not anymore. - ls she married? - She was. You think she 'd be happy to meet me? I think she 'd be, yes. Why did she give me up? Well, your mother was very young when you were born, Steve. Still in high school, did n't have a husband. She wanted a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of him. I tended to agree with her. - So, what 'd she do after high school? - She went to college in Albuquerque. Met a nice young man, got married. That 's why I could n't find her name in the book. She 's changed it. That 's it. To Mulligan. Does she ever talk about me, think about me? I 'm sure, in her private moments, she did. But not around her family. Could I have her number, Al? I do n't know why, but I 've got this strong feeling that I should be with her at Christmas. I 've got ta meet her. I 've got ta know who my real mother is. Well, that 's gon na be kind of tough. You see, in the first place, when she gave you up, she made it pretty final. That 's why she picked a good home. Has it been a good home, Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way it looks to me. But if I could talk to her, Al, like I 'm talking to you here now... I 'm sure she could handle it. I 'm her son. She died, Steve. - Karen 's dead. - What? A real bad auto accident, not too far from here. Oh, my God. I 'm sorry. I 'm sure she would have liked to have seen you. But she 's gone. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Brandon. All right, the surprise is all in place. I 'm worried that it 's gon na make mom more homesick than anything. Oh, do n't worry about your mother. She 's gon na be fine. Especially after she sees what I got her for Christmas. I 'll get it! I hope you guys like turkey. There 's gon na be leftovers for months. Hi, I 'm Samantha Sanders. Steve 's mom? Oh, yes, of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Oh, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I 'm sorry, but you look just like you do on TV. Oh, God, I hope not. Oh, no. I mean, you look wonderful. Thank you. I 'm sorry to disturb you. I wondered if you had heard anything from Steve? No, I have n't. Brandon, have you heard anything from Steve? No. I have n't heard a word for four days. Finally, today, I just could n't stand it anymore. I called the police. They 're gon na file a missing persons report in a few hours. I suppose he told you where he was going. Yeah, he did. I never should have let him go. But he was so adamant, so insistent on finding his real mother, that I thought standing in his way would only make things worse. What an idiot. I 'm sure he 'll call tonight, or tomorrow at the latest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you on Christmas. I ca n't believe it, either. Nobody celebrates Christmas like I do. When Steve was little, he used to have so many presents to open that by the time he got through them all, he was too exhausted to play with anything. Maybe that 's it. Maybe I gave him too many presents. Because whatever I did, it just backfired. That 's not true. I know Steve. He 's a wonderful boy. He 's funny and warm. - You had everything to do with that. - Maybe. Look, I do n't want to burden you with this on Christmas Eve. You 'll let me know if he calls, wo n't you? - l 'll just be at home. - No, you wo n't. You 're staying right here for Christmas. No, I could n't. I really should be there in case he calls. Please, I insist. Just for dinner. All right. lt 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You bet. I always thought if I met my real mom, maybe things would be different, that I 'd figure out where l fit in. It was a tough decision she made, giving up her baby. I just wish I would have known her, or at least met her. Well, she 's part of you. She 's in you. So maybe in 50 years, I 'll look like you, huh? If you 're lucky. You know, I never did have a grandfather. Would you be my grandfather, Al? It 'll be my pleasure. And we 'll keep in touch? I 'll send you cards and maybe someday, you 'll come visit me in L.A.? Sure thing. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Do you think you could give me a ride to the airport? I think I better be getting home now. I 'll be glad to. You did great today, Brenda, just great. - Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, well, see you, bye. - Bye. - Come on, let me see some id. - l do n't have any id. - Where do you live? - North Pole. Smart. You got a place to live, pal? Take a bus to the shelter downtown. You can get a free meal there tonight. Because you ca n't be hanging around here. - Merry Christmas. - Look, we 're not fooling around here. - What 's going on here? - Do n't worry about it. - l know this guy. - You do? Yeah, he 's Santa Claus. We have a complaint from a store over here that he 's been hassling shoppers. Has he been bothering you? No, in fact, I work there and that 's not true at all. Look, I did n't know the police were in the habit of hassling Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. - Look, it 's not that way at all. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're welcome. - Do you have anywhere to go tonight? - Oh, I have many houses to visit. Well, would you like to visit mine? I mean, I 'm sure my mother would n't mind. Actually, she might, but she 'll get over it. I just hate to see a Santa Claus alone on Christmas Eve. Could my reindeer wait for me on your roof? Absolutely. Just try and use the door. My dad has this thing about strange men sliding down our chimney. What can I do? Why do n't you just go in the living room and relax? No, really. I 'd like to help. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Jim Walsh. - St. Nick. St. Nick. Dad, do you guys mind if he stays for dinner? Brenda, who is he? Well, I sort of found him outside the store. I felt really bad for him. He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight. - Excuse us. - Me too. - Oh, hi. - Merry Christmas. Brenda, you ca n't just bring some strange guy off the street home for dinner! Why not? Look, it is Christmas. And he is Santa Claus. Well, who knows who 's lurking under that beard. My instincts tell me that he 's harmless. Oh, that makes me feel a lot better. Oh, I 'll get it. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Jackie, Kelly, what a surprise. Brenda, you did n't tell your mom we were coming? I have n't gotten around to it yet. - ls it all right? - Oh, of course, of course. I thought you were having Christmas dinner with Mel. - Mel. Mel who? - What happened? Mel decided to spend Christmas Eve with his ex at the last minute. I 'm sorry. I have survived worse. - Okay, two more for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - All right. Oh, it 's beginning to feel like a real Christmas. Hey. Hey. Merry Christmas. - l need to charter a plane. - Oh, sorry. I 'm just closing up here. I 've checked all the airlines. Every flight to L.A. is booked solid through tomorrow. I 've got ta get home tonight. This is an emergency. Wish I could help you, but this is Christmas Eve. Obviously, I 've got places to go. Come on! Look, it 's a quick hop to L.A. You 'll be home before you know it. I 'd like to, but... Please, you 've got ta help me. I 'm desperate. I 'll pay anything. Look, if this is n't enough, I 'll mail you a cheque for more. Hold on there, now. Let me think. Now, Dasher, now, Dancer, now, Prancer and Vixen. Could you take it easy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen! Help yourself, everybody. There 's more than plenty. Oh, my God, Cindy, this all looks incredible. You mean tastes incredible. I have n't seen a Christmas dinner like this in a long time. Can I take your sack? No, no, no. I 'll just hang on to it, if it 's all the same to you. Oh, I 'll get it. I mean... Oh, well, let 's both get it. - Merry Christmas. - Andrea, how nice to see you. Well, I told Brandon I might drop by. Here. My grandmother made you a brisket. Oh, thank you. Oh, I 'm sorry, Andrea, This is Mrs. Sanders. Steve 's mom. I 've heard a lot about you. You have? Excuse me. - Andrea! - Hi, Brandon. I 'm glad you could make it. Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm dying to try some of that plum pudding. I hate plum pudding. Hey, everybody, look who 's here! - Merry Christmas. - Hey, Andrea. Merry Christmas. And merry Christmas to you. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, merry Christmas. And who are you here to visit? My father. Well, good luck, son, and merry Christmas. Dylan. What a great surprise. Here. I got you some stuff. It 's not a lot. I just thought it would keep you entertained in here. Thanks for coming. I just guess I never expected to see you here. Why? Well, because I just figured that you kind of hated me right about now. No. No, I do n't hate you, Dad. But when I think about all the Christmases that I spent alone with the maid while you were off in the Bahamas, or skiing, or somewhere with one of your girlfriends... I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lonely at Christmas. And then I remembered how much it hurt. As much as I wanted to, I just could n't leave you hanging on Christmas Eve. Yeah. Well, you know something, son, I... You know, sometimes I think of this place like a monastery. And I 'm this monk. Because all I do is think and read and eat bad food. I always used to hate people who meditated. - Yeah, like Mom. - Yes. Yes, it always drove me crazy. I thought it was weak. But I guess that 's what I do now. I meditate. And I think about you, Dylan, and what a strong son I have, who 's out there in the world, all alone, just like I was. And here I thought it was supposed to get better. You know, the next generation. Yeah, I thought so too. Yeah. You 'll make things better, Dylan. You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there. It 's nothing fancy. Maybe we could have dinner. Do you still have that girlfriend? Brenda. Yes, I do. Well, you go have Christmas with her, Dylan. Why? Because you have given me probably the greatest Christmas present that I could ever ask for, more than I deserve. Now you go and make yourself happy. Dad, I 'm here for you. Bren 's got her own family. - l do n't want you to be alone. - Hey. I 'm not alone anymore. Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas, Dad. So, Andrea, what 'd you think of your first Christmas dinner? Now I have to try... - Did you make this? - Yes. - That was a wonderful dinner, Cindy. - Thank you. Santa never goes anywhere without generously rewarding his hosts. - No, that 's really not necessary. - No, no, no, I insist. Where did you get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, open it. Oh, it 's beautiful. - What 's this? - A gift from Santa. - And this one 's for you. - For me? They 're beautiful. Mom, Dad, look. Wow, Tiffany. I do n't know if we can accept this gift. Of course we can. And let me see here. This one 's for you. - Oh, I couldn't. - Well, of course, you could. Santa has something for everybody. I do n't know what to say. We sell those in my store. You know, I hate to say this, but Brenda finds this homeless man on the street -- With a bagful of expensive merchandise. Excuse me. I 'm gon na go count the silver. Hi, I 'm Mel Silver. I think you know my son. Yes, of course. Come on in. Hi, David. Hi, Mrs. Walsh. - ls Jackie here? - Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excuse me. I 'm really sorry, Jackie. I screwed up, I really blew it. You sure did. I made a stupid, stupid mistake. I just wan na... I thought she was in trouble, that I owed it to her to be there. But you ca n't hold on forever. There 's a point where, when you separate, you just got ta really separate. I 'm sorry it did n't work out for you. I never went. I just drove around, torturing myself, feeling like a jerk. Until it hit me. You 're the one I wan na be with, Jackie. I love you. I 'm really in love with you, Jackie. What happened? He thought my mom was in trouble and he owed it to her to be there. But he ca n't hold on forever. There 's a point when you separate, you just got ta separate. He never went. He drove for a while torturing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit him. - Okay, David, that 's enough. Merry Christmas, Kelly. Merry Christmas, David. I 'll get it. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Well, there was no snow in Mammoth, so we came home. Oh, my goodness. And I thought we were just gon na have a quiet little Christmas. - Oh, well, I can leave, if you want. - Oh, do n't be ridiculous, Donna. Just go on in and join the party. I 've just got ta go upstairs and check on something. - Hi. - Hi. Excuse me. I do n't believe this. Vintage World War I dog tags. - Outstanding. Thank you. - You 're welcome. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hey, what are you guys doing here? No snow, and they 're back together. Donna, you 'd better watch where you 're standing there. Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I hate to be the first to leave a really good party, but I should be going home. - l understand. - Good night, everyone. - Good night. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Are you sure that there 's nothing we can do? Just pray that he 's okay. Say good night to Cindy for me. And thank you for being there. My son has some wonderful friends. - Jim! Come up here, quick! - Excuse me. What is it? Well, he did n't touch the silver, but he 's taken my engagement ring! - Are you sure? - l 'm positive. I came up here to check the jewellery and it 's gone. - Well, is anything else missing? - No. Brenda brings some eccentric street person into our home carrying a bagful of presents from the most expensive stores in Beverly Hills. And well, I 'm sorry, as much as I would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all very suspicious. - What are you doing? - l 'm calling the police. I 'm sorry, Jim, but it 's our own fault, really. I mean, we 're just too generous, too trusting, too naive. I mean, we 've got to learn to be a little street-smart. What are you doing? - What 's this? - Well, open it. I was gon na wait until tomorrow, but under the circumstances... My ring! But when did you - -? I took it to the jeweller to have it reset over a week ago. I did n't even notice it was gone. I only took it off because the stone was loose. I hardly recognise it. It 's just gorgeous. Well, when I asked you to marry me, I could n't afford much. So I always promised myself that, if I ever had the money, I 'd make up for it and give you something special. Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it. And I love you. And I love you too. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, sweetheart. - Oh, I feel like such a grinch. - Why? Suspecting that poor sweet man of stealing my jewellery. I do n't blame you. He is a little hard to figure out. Let 's not try. I mean, just for tonight, I 'm gon na stay naive and pretend that people are honest and it 's a safe world we live in. And there really is a Santa Claus and he 's sitting in our living room right now. Why not? I mean, he 's got ta spend Christmas Eve somewhere. Steve? Steve? - Steve! - Mom, where have you been? Where have I been? I 've been waiting an hour for you to come home. You do n't know what it took to get here. I do n't think you 'll be happy when you find out how much it cost. Hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom. - l know. But you 're here now. I had to do it. I had to find out who my real mom was. And was she everything you expected? Everything and more. - l see. - Let me tell you about her. She 's beautiful and she 's caring. And she created me out of her love, 1 7 years of it. And with her busy life, she always made sure I was as happy as I could be. She always tried to show me to do the right thing. She was always there for me when I did n't. Gave me everything I ever wanted and probably more than I deserved. And no matter what, she always let me know how much she loved me. I 'm sorry I had to go so far away to find you, Mom. Oh, gorgeous. I 'm just so glad you 're back. - And I promise you one thing. - What 's that? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 've been a pretty good girl. - Would n't you say, Bren? - More or less. But I 'm not really into Christmas. I mean, I like it, it just kind of bums me out. Why 's that? Well, you know how Christmas is always everybody 's favourite holiday, except their own birthday? Well, my birthday is on Christmas and nobody ever remembers. They give me Christmas presents and call them birthday presents, or give me birthday presents and call them Christmas presents. And I never get a cake or my own party. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Donna Happy birthday to you - l 'll get it. - Who 's next? Andrea. - Come on, Andrea. Come on. - Oh, come on-- Oh, please, guys -- Merry Christmas, Bren. Dylan, I ca n't believe you 're here! How 's your dad? He 's good. He 's doing real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally penetrate the McKays. - Mom, Dad, guess who 's here! - We see. - Merry Christmas, Dylan. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sir. Merry Christmas, Dylan. Even when I was little, I did n't believe in Santa. I thought it was pointless to ask for anything. We did n't have a chimney or Christmas tree, but I do n't know, somehow, sitting here makes me... What the hell. You know what I want? I want a computer date book, I want bubble bath, oh, and there 's -- Hey, everybody, look who 's here. - Hi, Dylan! - Hey, Dylan. Merry Christmas, man. How 's the old man? Did n't I see you somewhere earlier today, Santa? I do n't think so. I 've been here the whole evening. Just who are you, anyway? What 's wrong? Does n't anybody believe in Santa anymore? Oh, come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa lurking around every corner. - You have to know where to find him. - Kelly! I wanted to know what happened to the magic of Christmas. I did n't believe it existed anymore. You see, for over 40 years, Mrs. Claus and I lived in a big house high up on the hill, and she made the most wonderful Christmas dinner. We had a big tree with loads of presents for lots of little elves. But the elves grew up and they moved away, some of them, far away, and had elves of their own. Santa used to visit them UPS and Mrs. Claus always made sure they got their gifts on time. And even though it was only she and Santa left in this big house, she still made the most splendid Christmas dinners. But last year, Mrs. Claus died. And as far as I was concerned, Christmas died with her. I wanted to pretend that Christmas did n't exist anymore, but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway. I was beginning to believe the only place Santa belonged in this town was in jail. Until that girl took in a lonely old man for dinner. Thank you, Brenda, for making me believe again in the spirit of Christmas. You 're welcome. I do n't know who it could be. Everybody we know is already here. We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Good tidings we bring To you and your kin Good tidings for Christmas And a happy New Year We all know that Santa 's coming We all know that Santa 's coming We all know that Santa 's coming And soon will be here Oh, it 's great. Happy now? Good tidings for Christmas And a happy New Year We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Why do n't you all come in for drinks? We have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, Nat. You guys go and then I 'll catch up with you down the street. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, I like that. - Merry Christmas, Nat. - Merry Christmas. That reminds me. I found my Santa outfit. The busboy moved it and put it under the counter. - Cool. - Hey, come on, everyone. Let 's go in the living room and sing some carols of our own. Oh, Jim, you 're not gon na play the organ, are you? As a matter of fact, I am. Give him a break, Mom. It is the holiday season. Okay, come on. All right, come on in, everyone. Gather around. Here we go. All right. Now, we all know this one. I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten And children listen To hear sleighbells in the snow Oh, my God, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright - Brandon! What 's going on here? - l do n't know, man. You tell me. He was waiting for me when I got home, wondering where l had been. - Can you imagine? - Merry Christmas, buddy. - lt 's good to see you. - lt 's good to see you too, man. It 's great to be home, really. You know what else? - What? - l 'm starving. Well, come on, you came to the right place. I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten And children listen To hear sleighbells in the snow I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright And may all your Christmases Be white Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas!
