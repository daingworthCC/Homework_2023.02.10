I just wanted you to know, I started making preparations for paying you back. I 'm sure you have. I 'm not very worried about it. This is nice. Yeah. We do alright, eh? Who 's " We "? That 's why I wanted you to come over tonight. There 's somebody I want you to meet. This is my sister. Christina. I 'm sure she 'd say hi, but... she has n't really been able to talk for some time now. The doctors have n't - - Have n't been any help. They just keep telling me... " any day now ", or, " It wo n't be long now ", but, I have n't given up hope. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she comes around. I 'm not even... I 'm not really sure if she knows who I am anymore. I have a nurse that stays here with her during the week. So she does n't feel so alone. I just wanted you to understand why I blew up at you the other night. That 's all. I thought it was the money this whole time. If I had known that it was -- I know. I know. After Christine 's health declined, I began researching alternative methods of treatment. Most were worthless, but, One was pretty interesting. The Romans believed that The soul escaped the body with the last breath. Sometimes they would preserve it in bottles, Or a family member would inhale it at the moment of death. That 's breath capture. You 've heard of it? Yeah. This new age store that I went to, Was selling these little charms that you could breathe into, And give em to someone. I mean, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... until I found this. I found an article that he wrote in a medical journal. Where he just goes... on, and on, and on about how... breath capture would save millions of lives. There 's just no proof that he ever actually did it. Except for you. At least now we know it would 've worked on Christine. I know I said this, But I really want you to know how sorry I am. Listen... I 'll make you a deal. There could be more of these vials out there. Or maybe the key to how Kaminsky made it work. With your connections, you 're in a much better position than I am to -- To find em. So do - - Do this for me. Help me save Christine. And we 'll worry about the money later. I do n't care about that nearly as much as I do about her. Deal? Okay.( Music)( Doorchimes) Hello. Hey. Busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up, Nina? I was...

Just tell me what 's going on. I do n't even remember drawing those, And then there 's this noise in my head and everything goes blank. And this was after you used the vial? And those people who busted up the shop... that 's what they wanted? Yeah. Then let 's go see them.( Music)( Traingoingby)( @knocking_on_door)( Trainbells) Nuh uh. Just you. It 's alright, Ruby. I was beginning to wonder if you 'd ever show up. Yeah, well, My circumstances have changed a little bit since the last time we met. Blackouts? Personality changes? Something like that. What else? This is what else. So now you 've come looking for answers. What makes you think I have them? When you came into my shop that day, you knew. You knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals are? Free radicals are the molecules in our bodies Which cause aging. And they have everything to do with what 's happening to you. In the 30 's, A doctor named Randolph Kaminsky held a test study. It was for a new drug he developed Which was supposed to eliminate free radicals... creating longevity, And healing incurable diseases. Kaminsky had a hard time finding volunteers, though. So, he made a deal with the penal system. The inmates on death row were offered parole Or a reduced sentence if they volunteered to be the lab rats. What he did n't tell the inmates was what the drug would actually do. He gave it to them and they died. Instantly. The drug only worked if it had a chemical reaction inside the body first. Something about the breath exhaled at the moment of death made it work. He collected them. And the other half of the group, Who were all suffering from terminal illnesses, Including Kaminsky himself, Inhaled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure, Then why am I having these violent urges, And these visions of people being murdered. What you did n't know, Was the one that inhaled the breath of those inmates, Would get something besides longevity. New personalities? And memories. This is most likely the formula for the drug. Is there a way to reverse this or not? The only way to reverse what 's happening to you is inhale another vial. Kaminsky may have had more of them in his possession. He 's the only one who knew where they were. Which means... you 're the only one who knows. The vials would have a certain market value. So we may be able to help each other.( Music) Did you come to do the other side today, or..? Two Baltimore men were sentenced to 15 years in federal prison today For attempting to sell an undercover officer $40 worth of cocaine. So you were right. There are more vials out there. You found one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are, Then we can help your sister. Susan, that 's great! There 's only one thing : she 's gon na have to inhale two of them. One to cure her, And then one to reverse it. It 's hard to explain, But it 's at least worth a shot. Yeah... yeah. Where do we look? I do n't know. If you want, we can talk about it over dinner. My treat this time. I got ta get my keys. Okay. Police are asking for your help tonight in finding The assailant of two teenagers who were found murdered in Cherry Hill.

No no no. We can be killed. But we 'll never get sick, we 'll never grow old. Neither will you. Oh. I 'll just be a fucking murderer. Susan, we were in the same boat as you. The violent tendencies, the blackouts. But, together, we beat it. So can you. There was another patient in the film : a man. What? He 's the one who gave me this. And this.
