5260141 Yep, that 's me. Kronk. Wait. Where did I go? Right, there I am. Covered in cheese like a human pizza. My life was fine until today. - But now I 'm doomed. Doomed! - Ah! You know, it was n't always like this. I helped save the emperor 's life. Found a rewarding career. Next slide! I even made some great new friends. Oh! But look at me now! Hiding out like a frightened kid who needs a hug from his teddy bear. The little yellow one with the button nose. Ah, if only I could turn back the clock. Back to a time when I had a spring in my step and a... smile in my heart. A time I like to think of as earlier that same day. Ahhh! Mmm! Mmm! Come on! Mm-hmm. That 's what I 'm talking about. Look out! Here it comes! So right about now you 're probably wondering, " Hey, where 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom baby! Emperor Kuzco here, coming at you live from the palace. Hail Kuzco! No, please, do n't grovel. I 'd feel stupid. I 'm not that kind of guy anymore. I 'm nice now. Did n't you see the first movie? Yay! A 50-foot me! Oh, I love that movie, ' cause it 's all about me. But right now it 's Kronk 's turn to be in the limelight. Let me put this as simply as I can. This one 's his movie. Not my movie. His movie. Not mine. His, not mine. His. Not mine. You got it? Even the little one's? OK. I 'll be back to check on you later. Have some popcorn, a little sippy-sip of your sip stuff. Places, please. Action! Ordering! Waffle platter, extra butter, two honey-glazed pill bugs and a chocolate sundae, hold the cherry. One diet plate. Got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect day. The orders were flying, the joint was jumping, grease was popping and everybody knew my name. Kronk! Oh, yeah, I was living the dream. Hey, Kronk! How about some grub? - Pacha! - Hey, Kronk! Tipo. Chaca. Put her there, Junior Chipmunks. Nice handshake, Chippers! - Mmm. Someone 's been practicing. - Oh! You 're too kind. Pacha, you forgot your change yesterday. Hey, thanks, Kronk! Well, what 's right is right. Otherwise... - It 'd be wrong! - Right. Boy, the place is packed. Yeah. Never had this many friends when I was an evil henchman. And look at you now, chef at Mudka 's. And head delivery boy! Delivery Boy logo by permission of Delivery Boy Local 8675309. - I get my one-year pin next week. - That calls for a celebration! A toast to Kronk! May you be this happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to deliver this urgent llamagram. Llamagram. Thank you. Everything OK, buddy? Oh! Are you kidding? It 's just your run-of-the-mill urgent llamagram. What am I gon na do? What am I gon na do? I know. I 'll tunnel out of here with a spoon, escape through the sewers and live as a quiet but lonely shepherdess named Maria. That 'll work. We 're out of spoons! That 's it. I 'm done for. Chin up, big guy. I 'm here for you. You! This is all your fault! You... You 're the one who got me into this mess! If you 'd listened, you could have had everything. But no. You had to listen to Miss Goody Two-Wings. Mr. Goody Two-Wings. Yeah, big talk coming from a guy in a dress. - I told you, it 's a robe. - And those are pearls. Fellas! You 're not helping. Now where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's with you? - It 's my father. He 's... He 's... " Ca n't wait to meet your wife and kids and see your big house on the hill. Cordially, your father, Papi. " So? So Papi said I have to have all those things if I 'm ever gon na be a success. And I once had them, but I lost them! - So? - I never told him that part. Big whoop. Tell him the truth. What? Tell him the truth? Are you nuts? You do n't let a guy like Papi down, or you 'll get one of these. The Cold Shoulder, the Frenzied Eyebrow, the Grimace of Doom, the Sneer of Despair, the Crippling Wince of Guilt, the Scowl of Impending Wrath, and worst of all, the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection. Total rejection. Right, right. Mm-hmm. I remember it well. Too well. You see, I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papi did n't approve. He said if I did n't get serious, I 'd never amount to anything. But nothing I ever did was good enough for him. All I ever wanted was a thumbs up from Papi. And I was so close. I once had a beautiful house on a hill. Papi woulda loved it. That house was a dream come true. Are you gon na tell me your life story, or are we gon na get back to running a restaurant? You 're right. Priorities. Get comfortable. I 've got a lot to get off my chest. Oy! I had to ask. Oy! I had to ask. My nightmare began on a day like any other. So, technically, I guess that would be a " daymare. " But I digress. It was lunchtime, and I was making my usual deliveries around town. I always saved the best stop for last, to see my dear old friends at the Flickering Embers Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never hope to meet. A perfect example of how to grow old with grace and dignity. Does this look like a rash to you? Has anybody seen my teeth? Oy! My aching knee. I sure wish there was some way to stop getting old. If only they could put youth in a bottle. I 'd pay anything for that. Again with the youth potion. - How many times do I have to - There 's no such thing! - But if there were... - But there 's not! - I said " if "! - If, schmiff! OK, you two lovebirds. I do n't have any youth potion, but I did bring you lunch. - Hello, Kronk! - Hello, Kronk! - Hiya, Kronk! - Rudy! Gim me some stick. What 's shaking? - What is n't? - Brought your favorite : - Pur? e of mystery meat. - Oooh! Now that 's a lunch I can sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prune juice. Ahhh! Drink up, everyone! Liquid gold. Ugh! How can you drink that stuff? Kronk says it 's good for us. Good enough for me. Fill her up, Kronk! - I guess that 's everything. - Are n't you forgetting something? - No, that 's not it. - Here you go, pal. From all of us. Oh, no, Rudy. I could n't. We insist! It 's for your house fund. You know. So you can afford that house on the hill your father always wanted you to have. Oh, yeah. And then I could finally get the big thumbs up from Papi. Yeah. How 's that going? Oh, I 'll get there. Someday. How about fresh pill bug tomorrow? - All right! - I 'll see you all later. Oh, boy. Uh, somebody lose this? Anybody? That 's weird. Ooh! Hey! Little did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If only there 'd been some kind of warning. A sign. Anything. Oh, you 're a feisty one. Hold still now. Huh? Hmm... Ahh! All right. Where 'd you go, you little rascal? Looking for... this? Hello, Kronk. Yzma! What are you doing here? I live here. Ever since I was thrown out of the palace. Ah. Weird. Never seen you around. Ah, but I 've seen you, Kronk. - Oh. You look good. - You think? At least you 're not a cat anymore. - Except for that. - Yes. An unfortunate side effect of our last escapade together. Yeah. Good times. You drank that potion, turned you into a cat. Who would have thought? It was a pink one like this. Do n't touch the pink one! It 's cough medicine. Hope you get to feeling better. I 'd love to stay and reminisce, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. And I have a proposition for you. A business proposition. Oh. Whoo! You see, Kronk, I 'm not the person I once was. I 've changed. I 've turned myself around and devoted myself to hel " helping others. " Oh, well, that 's some turnaround. I want to help those old geez... I mean, your friends out there. Would n't you do anything to ease their suffering, Kronk? - Of course I would, Yzma. - Good. Then follow me! Pull the lever! Uh... This lever? - I worked out the bugs. - Just checking. Whoo! Huh? Wait for it. This is even better than your last one! Whoo! Welcome to my new secret lab. - Souvenir photo? - Rats! My eyes are closed. Follow me! Whoa! Looks like someone 's been busy. I 've finally done it. I 've created the elixir of life. The answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bottle! - Regular and diet. - Huh. What do you call this? Yzma 's Young and Beautiful! Heh. Catchy. And now that you 're here, I finally have the one person who can make my plan a success! And that person would be? - You. - Me! I knew that. Wait. Why me? Because I 'm not exactly what you call a " people person. " And everyone trusts you. Those old people will buy anything you tell them to. So you want me to sell this to them? What do you say, Kronk? Help me to help you to help them? I ca n't take money from them. It would n't be right. Oh, too bad. Now I guess you 'll never get that great big house on a hill and the big thumbs up from Papi. Papi? Bingo. Whoa! What will you serve it on, Kronk? Plastic Tupper? Help you to help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean, you need gold. " You 'll achieve a beautiful connection with your father. " Yes! Now, sell, sell, sell! Whoa! Whoa! Step right up. It 's finally arrived. The cure for everything that ails you. Yzma 's Young and Beautiful! Ugh. It 's a, uh, youth potion. Ohhh! - Here you go. - Kronk! Does this stuff really work? Does this stuff really work? Of course it does, you idiot! Of course it does, you idiot! Good enough for me! Drink up, everyone! Liquid gold. Oh. Look at my range of motion! My elbow does n't creak! I 'm melting away the pounds! Hair! I 've got hair! Look out, old Yzma 's back! Well, that worked. Suckers! It 's like a dream come true. I put slime in a bottle, call it a youth potion and they ca n't get enough. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world! Again! Shut up! Whoo! Could she be crazier? Cuckoo! You see what 's going on here, do n't you, folks? Here 's a hint. You got sewer slime, fancy packaging, crazy laugh like a demon from the bowels of the earth. It 's a scam! Her potion 's a fake! She 's selling snake oil, people! Wake up! Oh, you saw it already, huh? Well, smarty, I bet you did n't see this! Oh! Yikes! That 's gon na haunt me in my nightmares. Can we just move on, please? Guy in the booth! Now! Big load of happy coming through. Does n't get better than this, does it? I 'm making tons of cash for my house fund. Now if only I could find a house on a hill. Kronk, heard you were looking for a house on a hill. - You heard right. - We need money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we 're selling the senior home. Good luck with that. How much? Sold! Look, everyone! - I sold the house! - Hooray! OK. Take care. Bye-bye. Oh, yeah. It 's all coming together. Dear Papi, remember how you never thought I 'd amount to anything? Well, I got news for you. Good news! I finally got that big house on a hill you always wanted me to have. It 's really great. You 're gon na love it. It 's got all the amenities. Swimming pool, golf course... The windmill 's a killer. And my favorite part of all... Whoo! Pancake Junction! I even built a cozy little guest wing just for you. Yep. Just a big, serious house for a big, serious guy. Like me. That 's who I am. Marge, you getting all this? - Tina. - Right. Sorry. Anyway, Papi, do n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I know you 're gon na be so proud of your little Kronker. - Mr. Kronk? - Yes, Tina? - Marge. - Right. Wait. What? - A Mr. Rudy is here to see you. - Rudy? Rudy who? Hey, Kronk! Oh, that Rudy. Long time no see! Rudy! What happened to you? You 're, uh, not wearing any clothes. - Oh, that. I sold my clothes to buy more of Yzma 's youth potion. You sold your clothes? I sold everything. We even sold the senior home. - You sold your home? - Yeah. To you. Oh. Yeah. - We 're flat broke. - That 's awful. I know. I ca n't afford any more youth potion. Think you can do anything to help out an old friend? Oh. How about if I spot you a bottle? My precious! Kronk just wants to keep it. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not right here. Figure that out on your own, genius? Yeah, sure did. - Figured what out? - OK. Uh... Take a look at your pal, Rudy. This is before. This is after. Before. After. You see any difference? Hmm. Can I see " before " again? Well, I give up. They look exactly the same. He looks exactly the same, so the potion is worthless, and Yzma 's a crook, and it 's all my fault because I helped her do it. What 's the problem? Look at him. He 's happy. Eh, fine. You win. Oh, yeah. Rudy? Yzma 's youth potion is a fake. - She cheated you. - Oh? And... I cheated you too. Oh... I 'm sorry. I guess we better go tell the others. The others! I almost forgot! They 're about to elect Yzma emperor! I never knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Thank you, thank you! I 'd like to thank all the little people, but what do they matter? What matters is me, me, me! And when you elect me as your new emperor, I 'm going to be on top of the world! - Stop this charade! - Yzma 's youth potion is a fake! - Stop this charade! - Yzma 's youth potion is a fake! Kronk? What are you doing? - I want you all to look at Rudy... - Uh!... and tell me what you see. Whoo! That is one hot hunk of man! He 's in his golden years. Not getting any younger. Chronologically challenged. I got wrinkles, bunions, ear hair! I 'm still old! Hey, he 's right. I 'm still old too. Me too! And Hildy looks like... Uh-uh-uh. Do n't even! Yzma 's a crook! - Yzma 's a witch! - Would you excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Come on, fellas! Hit it, girls! - Whoo-hoo! - Yippee! - There she is! - She 's a liar! - Get her! - Stop her! - Do n't let her get away! - Shame on you! Got you! Back off, or I 'll jump! Wait! That ca n't be right. Whoo! OK. Why do n't we all just take a step back? Not you, Yzma. She stole everything we have! Yeah, we did n't chase her all the way down here for nothing! Nice moves back there, Hildy. Oh! What about you? Pouncing like a wildcat. Hey, I just realized something. We chased Yzma all the way down here. Did n't I just cover that? Do n't you see? We 're busting moves like a bunch of teenagers! Ooh! So, what you 're saying is, even though the potion was fake, we 're only as old as we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you of every last cent. Wait. That ca n't be right. - Let 's get her! - Stand back! Do n't make me use this! Ooh! Your cough medicine? No! My most fiendishly diabolical potion ever! When I drink this, you wo n't be able to lay a finger on me! Get her! - How cute! - Cutie pie! See? I told you so. That 's weird. Let 's all reflect on these lessons on our way home tonight. Well, everyone, back to the alley. - You 're living in an alley? - Well, sure. We sold our house to you. I got dibs on the cardboard box! Come on! You had the box last night. It 's my turn. This is awful. I 've got to find them a place to live. But where can I find a gigantic house with 30 extra bedrooms? Where? Think, think, think! - You thinking what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinach puffs? Oh, no! Your house! Right! Whoa, Nelly! Let 's not overreact. You wan na lose your dream house? That 's gon na get us the big thumbs up from Papi. If I lose the house, I 'll let Papi down. I ca n't let Papi down. But you tricked Rudy out of that house! Oh, my! It 's true! I took away Rudy 's home! Hey! You got that house fair and square! Yeah, but he cheated his best friend! No, he did n't! Yes, I did. I got ta do the right thing. Rudy! Let 's talk real estate. Looking jiggy, Burt! Feeling jiggy, Kronk! All aboard for Pancake Junction! Tina! Marge! You 'll be OK. I 'll help you land on your feet. Do n't worry about us. We 've been contacted by a team of headhunters. - But what 's going to happen to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No worries. I may be giving up everything, but it was the right thing to do. So when you think of our brief time together here, do n't cry for me, Marge and Tina. You did n't! Afraid so. Oy. Enough with the pity party. You did good. End of story. Back to work. Yeah, but doing good cost me my dream house. - And then... - Do n't tell me. It cost me my girl. I said do n't tell me. These oven mitts were the last thing she touched, other than my fragile heart... Oy.... before she walked out of my life. Roll film! Ah! Wrong movie. What 's a troth? It all happened at Camp Chippamunka. Yeah, right! We were there for the Chipmunk Challenge. We won Troop of the Year two years running, going for three. OK, Chippers! - First, we got ta pitch the tents. - Yay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hey, Bucky. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Squeakity-squeak. There 's a new troop leader named Birdwell who wants to take away our... trophy! Look at them. They 're really snot and polish. Yeah. It 's " spit and polish. " - Snot. - Spit. - Snot! - Spit! Whoa. Easy, kids. Spit, snot, same general neighborhood. And do n't worry about this Birdwell guy, whoever he is. The important thing here is that there are no losers. But you always win. Right, Kronk? We always win. But winning 's not what really counts. Remember our motto. " Keep the focus on fun! " Two shorts and a long. The Aquatic Games are about to begin! You know what that means, Tipo? Right. Last one in 's a rotten egg! Hup, hup, hup, hup... Halt! Left face! - Troop leader? - Yes, Junior Chipmunk? Permission to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's not me! It 's Mrs. Queetzo. Oh, gosh. Well, we ca n't have that, can we? Now, uh, um, give me the doll. Yes. I 'll have to have a word with her. Now... See here, Mrs. Queetzo. Uh, Yoli is a top-notch swimmer, and she 's very, very brave. So steady as you go, Chipper. You 're in excellent hands. Yes. Mm-hmm. Oh, super-duper! That 's more like it. What did she say? She 's going to be just tickety-boo. Very well then. And off you go. Hup, hup, hup, hup... Let the aquatic competition begin! Yeah! This is gon na be fun! Hurry up! Cannonball! Cannonball! Oh, I 'm so proud of my little Chippers. Oh, dear. Are you all right? Oh, you 're a troop leader. Are you hurt? Can you speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision. Feet like a pair of landlocked tugboats. Knees like brass doorknobs. Elbows so rough they could take the grain right off a two-by-four. And her eyes. They say the eyes are the window to the soul. Hers were more like steel-reinforced security doors with a combination I just had to crack. No doubt about it. She was the kinda girl you 'd want to bring home to Papi. Wow! The Chipmunk Handshake of Fellowship, Level Seven. A level attainable only by the most dedicated of troop leaders. You 're good. Well, you 're better. You 're sensational. You 're dazzling. - I 'm Kronk. - I 'm Birdwell. - You 're Birdwell? - Yes. - But you 're a girl! - Cannonball! Ahhh! - Awesome! - Phat wave, dude! Nice form, Chippers. What do you think you 're doing?! Uh... Cannonball? Duh! Look at poor Mrs. Queetzo! She 's all... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... swimming competition. Oh, it 's all about the competition with you? Yeah. Wait. What? No matter what it does to the tinies? Hey, I always put my, uh... tinies first. Ha-ha! Obsessed with being first. I knew it! Fortunately, there are rules about this sort of thing. - What sort of thing? - Ahem! Rule 4.7, paragraph A, subsection 2, revised : " Troops shall compete in alphabetical order. B before K, except after May, or when sounding like A as in ' neighbor ' or ' weigh '. " - Says who? - Says the Official Chipmunk Rulebook. No way! Way! Troop Kronk is disqualified! The aquatic competition goes to Troop Birdwell! Hey! That 's not fair! You ruined the aquatic event for my poppets. But now you 've ruined it for my, uh... - Poppets.... poppets! I knew that! You should 've thought of that sooner. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happening? I-I-I just do n't understand. It just does n't make any sense. Was it loop over, loop under and pull, or loop under, loop over and pull? Tipo? You OK, little pal? We 're gon na lose the trophy because of her. Yeah! Now, now. Let 's, uh... keep the focus on fun. - What about her? - She disqualified us! Yeah, and you 're the best troop leader ever, Kronk. She ca n't do that to you. Can she? Just who does she think she is? Just who does he think he is? Poor Yoli. You 'll catch your death of cold. And then he tries to act all innocent. Thinks he can charm me with those rippling muscles and that... that... crooked smile and those deep, deep sensitive eyes. No! He ca n't do this to my little Chippers. She ca n't do this to my little Chippers. - Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. The gloves are coming off. We 're going mano a womano. Let the games begin! Stroke! Stroke! So. It all comes down to one event. The Chipmunk Cheer-Off! There 's only one thing to do. Practice, practice, practice! Do whatever it takes to win! Here 's how we 're gon na do it! We 're gon na hit them hard. Come at them with everything we got. Get out there and give a 110 percent! Whatever happened to " keep the focus on fun "? We ca n't let him down. We just got ta win that trophy for Kronk! You know what I 'd do? Cheat. What am I hearing? You ca n't do that! - Nah-nah-nah-nah. - Stop it! Ha-ha! Crybaby, crybaby, stick your head in pie, baby! Make him stop! Make him... Hey! Kronk said, " Do whatever it takes to win. " Right. Whatever it takes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we practice our routine ten times through without a mistake. Uh-uh-uh! Spirit smiles! I want to see spirit smiles! Yes. That 's more like it! Peppy and poised! Remember, do n't think of your opponents as a rival troop. - Think of them as...... the enemy! Layout. Very good. This is no ordinary cheer-off. Basket toss. Higher! This is a test of everything we stand for! - The culmination of all of our efforts! - You call that a backflip? By this time tomorrow, the trophy will be ours! Right, Chipmunks? Chipmunks? Oh, man! This really stinks. Yeah. I want to go swimming. I want to have some fun. I want to go home. This is all her fault. This is all his fault. Well, if there 's one sure-fire way to cheer up a Chipmunk it 's raisin bread. OK, flour. Sugar, raisins, yeast. I 'm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Take that, you... You, you, you, you... Take that! " Upset "? She 's beating me in effigy. But her soul yearns for the soothing salve of human kindness. Go to her. Go. Hey, look. Are n't those your eggs? " Kronk 's. Property of Kronk. Do not touch, except for Kronk. " Hey! What are you doing with my eggs? What are you doing with my raisins, sir? - These are n't yours. - " Birdwell 's raisins. Property of Birdwell. Do not touch except for Birdwell. " Huh. You think I would have seen that. - I need those raisins. - I need them more. - You 're ruining this. - You 're wrecking it. - You disqualified us! - You tried to drown us! - This is all your fault. - This is all your fault! - Is not. - Is too! - You twit! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, uh... your kids are really unhappy, huh? Rock-bottom, actually. I 'm the worst troop leader ever. I 'm the worst troop leader ever. - How did we go wrong? - I just became so competitive. Yes, but I 'm even more competitive than you. You mean like that? Hey, I like it when you laugh. I 've got a proposition. I 've got a proposition. - My eggs, your raisins. - Oh! We could bake beautiful bread together. Get out your oven mitts. Things are about to get hot.? Earth, Wind Fire : Let 's Groove I 'm queen of the world! Come on. Throw caution to the wind. I ca n't. You 'll laugh at me. Do n't you trust me? I do trust you. Whoa! It 's like a whole new you. Really? Uh-huh. I think this has been the best night of my whole life. Me too. Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kronky-poo? I 'm OK! I 'm fine! Dear Papi, remember how I 've never been able to meet the right girl? Uh, any girl? Well, I finally found the woman of my dreams. She 's everything you could want in a woman and more. Do n't get too excited. We 'll take it nice and slow at first. Mazel tov! We 'll marry in a fancy ceremony and have lots of kids. Love, Kronk. Perfect! He found his one true love! That is so beautiful! Can I have a moment, please? Turn away. OK. OK. All better. Go, go, go. Go back to the funny. I 'm bringing you down. - Good morning, Chippers! - We 've got a surprise for you. Raisin bread! The one sure-fire way to cheer up a Chipmunk! Got ta tell you, Chippers, I 'm, uh not proud of how I 've been acting lately. Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kronky-poo "? So we 're here to declare that the feud between us is officially over. That means no more hostility quarreling...... one-upmanship... We 're doing it again, are n't we? They 're finishing each other 's sentences. Yeah, it 's creepy. But nice creepy. The competition between our troops has gotten out of hand. Which brings us to this afternoon 's final event. - The Chipmunk Cheer-Off. - You 're not canceling the cheer-off? Yeah. We 've been working on our routines all year! Very well, but only on one condition. From now on, we want you to play fair... Be good sports and... Keep the focus on fun! I 'm so proud of them. Hey, where 's Tipo? Kronk is gon na love this. Scrape out these seed pods, mash them into itching powder, sneak the powder into their chalk at the cheer-off, and they 'll be completely humiliated while we achieve total domination! Everybody ready? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check! - Team spirit? - Go, team! Go, team! Chaca, there is no " l " in " team. " But there 's a " U " in " euphoric. " And there 's a " me " in, uh " mediocre. " I got you something. For me? I know this is all really new. And I hope you wo n't think that I 'm moving too fast, but there comes a time when a man 's got ta say how he feels. Oh, Kronk. Monogrammed oven mitts. Oh, just my size. Good luck, Kronky-poo. Thanks, Miss Birdy-poo. Yo, crowd, let 's get loud! Go, Chipmunks! Awesome! - All right! - Yeah! Yes! Oh, yay! That was wonderful, Kronky-poo! You 're gon na be even better, not that it matters who wins. - We 've already won. - We 've already won. Now I know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to chalk up your hands. You do n't want to fall. I 'm not worried. I know you 'd be there to catch me. Say what?! This is gon na be so awesome! - I know. They 're really good. - Yeah, but we 're gon na win. I cheated, just like you said. Oh, that 's great, Tipo. Wait, what? I put itching powder in their chalk. You said do whatever it takes to win. I know you 'd be there to catch me. Noooooo! " Tipo 's Itching Powder. Property of Tipo. Do not touch except for... " Tipo?! How could you? I 'm so disappointed. Oh, no. What am I gon na do? Eh, let the kid take the rap. He 'll do easy time. You put the idea in his head. Look at him out there. - He 's six. - Uh-oh, the lip. Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Start flapping your jaw, the girl goes bye-bye. - Forever? - Heartbreak City. - No. - So you 're gon na weasel out while they send Tipo off to the big house? You forgetting something? You want this, you need that. Dangerous. You could have hurt somebody. I can not believe that you would disgrace the Chipmunk name in this manner! But Tipo needs me. Let him go! It 's all my fault. Kronky-poo? You told Tipo to cheat? I told him... do whatever it takes to win. Wait! - It was all a big mistake. - I 'll say it was. The biggest mistake of my life! I thought I could trust you. But Miss Birdy-poo... Do n't ever call me that again! On second thought, do n't call me ever! She 's gone. And all I have to remember her by are these. Now I 've got nothing. No, what you 've got is a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party pot two blue cheese bombs and a cracker cheddar surprise. Stat! How can you think of fondue at a time like this? Look, you made the right choice. You saved the kid. But I lost the girl. Now I 'm a two-time loser, and my father 's gon na be here any minute. More like any second. Ah! What am I gon na do? Just tell him the truth. I ca n't handle the truth! Where am I going to find a wife and kids and house on a hill? How 's dinner coming? I got ta get the wife and kids back to our house on the hill. You want to borrow my house? - And me? - And them, if it 's no trouble. Kronk, you should be ashamed of yourself. Trust me, I am, but not as much as I 'd be if Papi finds out I 'm a failure. He 'll come with everything. Cold Shoulder, Frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wince of Guilt, Scowl of Impending Wrath, and worst of all, the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection. What 's wrong with Kronk? Duh. You made him look like a big fat liar in front of Miss Birdwell! Hey, do n't guilt-trip the kid! - It 's not his fault. - No, he 's right. I 've got to help him. Now come on, Chich, he 's our friend. Pacha! You saw the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection. We have to do something before his father gets here. Too late. He 's here. - Ah! It 's him! - I know what to do! I 'll just wait here, like a sane person. Kronker? Kronker? - Kronker, front and center! - Yes, sir! Oh! Papi! What do I look like, your Aunt Matilda? Put her there! Papi? Papi? Huh? Oh! Where are your manners, son? Uh, sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kronk 's wife. - I 'm Chicha. - Chicha. How 'd this knucklehead ever land a catch like you? Well, he just asked. Really. And these are my grandkids? Front and center, kids, and... let me have a look at you. I said front and center! Names and ages! Chaca, sir! Age seven and three-quarters, sir! And this is Yupi. He 's only a half. And, uh, that 's my house up there, on the hill. Wow! I never thought I 'd live to see this. You, of all people, with a wife, kids and a house on a hill. Son, I do n't know what to say. Kronkers! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Now I really do n't know what to say. Who 's this... lovely lady? Well, she 's, uh... - I 'm Kronk 's wi... - Mother-in-law! - Granny! - Pach ita! Papi, this is Pachita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Enchant?. Now I see where Chicha gets her looks. OK. Who 's hungry? Let 's eat. Yeah, I 'm starving. I hope the chef here knows what he 's doing. Yeah, so do I. Whoa, little fella! Where are you going in such a hurry? Kronk 's in trouble! His father 's here! He does n't have a wife or kids or a house on the hill. I 've got to help him! Kronk 's in trouble? I know what to do. Hang on, big fella! The cavalry 's comin '! Ah, well, is n't this nice, Papi? You, me, Chicha, Mom. So, are you proud of me? Even a little? Humph. I 'm just glad to see you gave up all those crazy ideas - about cooking and talking to animals. - Kronk! Yoo-hoo! Yeah. Crazy. - Hey, Kronk, what 's cookin '? - Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No siree. - What 's he talking about? Him! - Him who? - Guy who was here. - What? - Why 's he asking you about cooking?! - Yeah. That 's weird. It 's a... a business deal. Oh, Kronk 's always got something cooking. Oh, yeah. Speaking of cooking, what does it take to get food here? - Talk to the chef. - I 'll go! Perfect. Gives us more time to get to know each other. Oh... Oh! Lucky me. I ca n't do this. - Look. Fondue night was your idea. - Ow, ow, ow! Fondue! They do n't get fed, they come after you. Wait. I 'll cook. Feel that! Like a python. Ordering. One bucket of brie, two Gouda gulps and a flaming fountain of fondue. Cardio special. Got it. And a side salad with poppy seed dressing. Papi?! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - So, what? Hello! Anybody up there? Where 's our food? I 've worked up quite an appetite. More water. Be right back. Kronk! I mean... Kronkles! OK. Stoke the fire. Stir the fondue. Chop the onions, lie to Papi. - Machu Picchu! - Kronky-wonky! Who is this? - Why, I 'm the lovely Mrs. Kronk. - Kronker! Uh... Right. I 'll go check on dinner. Hey! Is that any way to treat the lovely Mrs. Kronk? I thought I was the lovely Mrs. Kronk. Look at us. Putting on dresses. Pretending to be women. Kronk! What are you doing? Dinner rush. Four specials up and a party of ten in at 8:30. - Kronk! - Kronk? Kronk! Let me get this straight. She 's Mrs. Kronk and she 's Mrs. Kronk? - Papi, I can explain. - I 'm the lovely Mrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face. - Or maybe not. Is there anyone in this town who is n't Mrs. Kronk? - Daddy! - How about them? - Who are they? - We 're Kronk 's adorable kids! Oh! Kronk! - Sweetheart! - Tina, Marge. - Marge. - Tina. - Kronk! - Well, at least that 's everybody. Boom, baby! Like how I weaseled myself in the movie? Nice. - Kuzco? - How you doing, hot stuff? Hot stuff? Kronker! So this is right about where we started. Miserable. Covered in cheese. Trying to hold on to a big fat lie! Papi I have a confession. I 'm not who you think I am. I, uh... I 'm just a humble fry cook. And a delivery boy. That 's not all. Chicha 's not my wife. None of these folks are my wives. And these are n't my kids. Not even the one's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house up on the hill, that 's not mine either. And Pachita not even a woman. I lied to you, Papi. I just wanted you to be proud of me. I just wanted to get one of these. But all I ever got from you was... Yeah, that. I 'm a failure. The truth is I 've got nothing. But Kronk, you 've got us. And I would n't trade you guys for anything. Well, that would explain why you do n't have anything. For your information, Kronk used to have a big house. On a hill. - But he gave it away to us old folks. - And he had a girlfriend too. They baked us raisin bread. He gave up all those things to protect his friends. You were actually listening to my stories? I was weeping on the inside. Wait a second. I really would n't trade you guys for anything. Not even for a thumbs up. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think I 've got nothing, but the truth is I 've got everything. Not yet, you do n't. I 'm proud of you, son. Ohhh... Whoo! Papi! Come here, you little squirt. Kronk, wait! Tipo! How 's my little Chipper? I brought a friend. Hello, Kronky-poo. Miss Birdy-poo. I 've missed you so much. I missed you more. I thought... We 'd never see each other again. You know what this means. If they 're finishing each other 's sentences then it must be true love. - Kronk! - Awesome! Huh? Oh, how cute!? B5 : Let 's Groove? Eartha Kitt : Feel Like a Million
