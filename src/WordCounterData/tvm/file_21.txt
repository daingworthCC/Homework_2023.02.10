5212241 Nebraska Territory, circa 1853. Come on, girls. - Hello, Bob. - Afternoon, Miss Cuddy. Come on inside, I 've got supper ready. The pie is made out of peaches... from a can. They had four of those cans. I do n't know who got the other three, - I do n't know who could afford ' em. - It 's good pie. If it pleases you, we might have a postprandial recital. Okay, what? - A bit of music. - I like music.? On the distant prairie, where the heather wild,?? In its quiet beauty liv 'd and smiled,?? Stands a little cottage, and a creeping vine,?? Loves around its porch to twine.?? In that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child,?? With her blue eyes beaming soft and mild.?? And the wavy ringlets of her flaxen hair,?? Floating in the summer air.?? Fair as a lily, joyous and free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.?? Ev'ryone who knew her felt the gentle pow'r?? Of Rosalie, " The Prairie Flower. "? That sure was pretty singing ', Miss Cuddy. - I got some cheese. - Cheese? Yes, Ma'am, you know I 've got a few of your sheep now. I know. Well, I made some cheese outta their milk. I wonder if you 'd like to have some. I 've got some here in my pocket. The cheese would be a fine finish to our fried chicken dinner and peach pie this evening. Well then, here it is. This is fine cheese, Bob. So why not marry? Do what? Why not throw in together, land, animals, implement, lives, the whole ball of wax? We could use my capital and know-how to improve your claim and mine. And if the union produces children, so much the better. Looked at from any angle, it works. So why not marry? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife. Please, Mr. Giffen, I wo n't take " No. " for an answer. Miss Cuddy... I appreciate the offer and the supper, and the concert and all... but I can not marry you. Will not. Wo n't. I ai n't perfect, but you are too bossy. And too plum-damned plain. There ai n't no medicine for it. This one here 's still breathing a little bit, Mama. She is dead. Mother is dead! = Mor er d? d! = I 'll take her outside. No! No! We must bury her properly! I 'll prepare her. I 'll take her outside She is starting to smell. No! No! No! We must bury her properly! You wished for her to die. = Du? nskede for hende at d?. = You hated her. = Du hadede hende. = You hate me. = Du hader mig. = Take her inside! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her inside! Ice... Cold... FROZEN! Oh, my Jesus. To what do I owe this pleasure, Reverend? Springtime, Miss Cuddy. Are Clydene and the kids getting along all right? Meaner than ever and growing by the minute. Put your mule up and come on inside the house. There 's been some trouble amongst the women here abouts. I 've heard about it. It 's bad. Guess what I 'm ordering. - I couldn't. - A Melodeon. - You are not! - Yep, I do n't trust shipping a piano... so, soon as I get into Loup I 'm gon na order a Mason Hamlin Melodeon. You 'll have the only Melodeon in the Territory. Back home I used to play the piano by the hour. I ca n't live without real music much longer. - I could help you with them dishes. - I do n't want any help with the dishes. So... How you gettin ' along with that Giffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them. He helps me with my corn. We planted some potatoes together and we keep the fences up. How you getting along? When my bulls have finished their work here, I let him turn it turn up on his heifers. Well... Seems like you are getting along together all right. These are by dTStTP(?( T which is Greek to me. Feed him a meal every now and then. Like you do me. You 're a good citizen, Mary Bee. The bed up on the loft has fresh linen. I 'll take the slop out to the hogs before you go to sleep. You 're gon na give me a son. You 're gon na give me a son. Hell no! This here is a God damned free country, Dowd! Ca n't nobody make me do it. Thou shalt not take the Lord 's name in vain, Vester. - Especially not in His own house. - I wo n't go, I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savior, Vester. I ask you, why not? I ca n't take no time away from my crops and I got the girls to look after and I ca n't afford to pay for no wagon. - I ai n't in on this deal. - Then what are we gon na do about Theoline? Pitch her down a hole in the outhouse. You are a poor specimen of a man, Vester Belknap! - I came here for the drawing. - Me, too. Let 's get it over with. What about Vester? I 'll draw for Vester. - What do you mean? - I said I will draw for him. - What did she say? - I said, " I will draw for Vester Belknap. " Can we proceed? This is a painful occasion for you and your families and I grieve for you. Your wives are fine and godly women. But life gave them more than they could bear. Now we all draw lots. Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they come from. Shall we defer the lady? - I 'll draw last. - I 'll go first. Keep your hands closed until everybody 's drawn. Thor. Miss Cuddy. Put your hands in a circle here. On the count of 3... 1... - If that bean in my hand is black. I du n no... - 2... - Pass for it. - 3. Does that mean Vester has to go? But he said he would n't. He has to, he 's one of us. I baptized him. - I do n't trust Vester. - Me neither. It 's true, Reverend, Vester is a brute with no conscience. - I 'll go. - You can't. - Yes I will. - Well, hell, a woman? I can ride as well as anybody. And handle a team and shoot. You all know that. And I can cook and care for those women better than any of you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hell right! That 's mighty kind of you, Miss Cuddy. You tell us what you need, we 'll... we 'll see to it. - When will you leave? - As soon as I can. Today is May 5th. She could be back in time to celebrate 4th of July with us. Reverend Dowd, we can not allow this. It is not a lone woman 's place to drive a wagon across this country. Much less when it carries three of the Lord 's least capable children. Then why not go with me, Mrs. Linens, we can do it together. You too, Mrs. Polhemus, better still. No, you have husbands and family to care for, as you should. But I do not, because I live uncommonly alone. Enough, please, be seated. I 'm afraid you are all are right about Mr. Belknap, he 's untrustworthy with the task of this gravity, and we need a Homesman. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate for this journey, Miss Cuddy. If you gentlemen will excuse me for a minute. - Come to look after your wagon? - I did. - My Lord, what is that? - It 's a train wagon, traded for it last year. Since then it 's been sittin ' out here in the snow. When Svendsen and Sours come around here wanting ' a wagon, I gave ' em a hell of a deal on it... I give it to ' em. I cut the windows a little bigger, greased it real good, set some new spokes and fellows. That 's the just the right thing for them women. I put a sliding bolt on that door. - What for? - Lock them ladies in. - Why would I do that? - Stop and think about it. Oh. What 's that? You might wan na tie somethin ' down. Puttin ' in ten of ' em. Oh my, I 'm not sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Listen here, Mary Bee... You got a passable rig, mules, and you 're as good a man as any man here abouts. And you 're doing a hell of a fine thing. So go ahead on... get to it... and do it. - Does everybody know? - Yep. - What are they say? - Do n't say nothin '. People like to talk death and taxes. But when it comes to " crazy ", they stay hushed up. Miss Cuddy! Mary Bee! Mary Bee! Whoa! These are by dTStTP(?( T which is Greek to me. I tried to catch you in town, but you was already gone. What do you want, Reverend? To give you these, they 're letters to the women 's closest to kin around Hebron, Iowa and on back East. Your journey will be long, difficult and dangerous. I expect it will. Well, bless you woman. Bless you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you, I truly do? I know it. I 'd go in your place if I could. Now let us pray. Heavenly Father, look down upon my daughter. Bless her in this undertaking. Grant her thy strength, guide her with thy grace that she may carry home these poor souls. We beg of Thee. In the name of Jesus Christ, thy only begotten son who gave his life for the sins of man. Amen. Come on out outta there you claim-jumpin ' sonofabitch. Come down in here and you 'll be a sad bastard as long as you live and that wo n't be very long. Send your account to Finnedy, the bastard! But this here is Bob Giffen 's place. Bob Giffen has gone and abandoned this place, and I have a filed a new claim with... Go on, get the hell off of my roof, or face stiffle recourse, God damn it, I got lawyers. We need to hang that son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an angel? - You 're not dead. Help me. Would you help me? - For God sake? - Suppose I do? What would you do for me? Anything! Anything! As God is my witness! If I cut you down, will you do what I tell you to? Hell, yes I will! Swear to God! - You swear to it? - I swear. Swear to that Almighty God you 've been talkin ' about? Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord, and bringin ' in sheaves, and... do unto others, and... if you cut me down from this God damned tree, I 'll do anything you tell me to, I swear on God 's holy name. Please. All right, I 'll save you. I got a job 'll work for you. But if you try and hurt me or you try and run away... I 'll kill you. Take off the noose. I need to collect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I never met him. - What happened to his sheep? - I ate ' em. Now you 've been blasted out by vigilantes and hanged for jumping Bob 's claim. Hell! That 's abandoned. Now look at it. He did n't abandon nothing. He just went back East, to find himself a wife. It 's abandoned. It sure is. This is abandoned. Damn. Unhitch and stable the mules then tend to my mare, Dorothy, and see to it that all the stock on the place is fed and watered. Your horse needs feed, too. Well, if you do n't care to, I will, and then your supper 'll be an hour late! Get up that wagon! Get up here now! C'm on! Step up! C'm on! Get on there! Cleanup before you come in. What 's this job of work you have in mind? I would be grateful if you not use my good chair that way. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is Mr. Cuddy? - I 'm unmarried. What 's the job? Three women in this country have lost their mind... their husbands ca n't care for them properly. You and I are gon na take them back across the river to Iowa. - The Missouri River? - We 'll leave tomorrow. Hell, that 's five God damn weeks from here! I will not sit still for profanity in my house. I can see why you 're single! I need someone who can hunt and guide and spell me at the rains, help with the animals on the trip. That 's why I set you free. It 's your job and you 're sworn to do it. Three crazy women for five weeks is a lot more than I bargained for. If you 've lied to me, and intend on abandoning your responsibility, then you are a man of low character, more, disgusting pig than honorable man. Thank you for the kind words, Sister. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tin pail and you are bossy! But I 'll sit out with you, because I said I would. And I 'll help you tend your cuckoo-cuckoo clocks as long as it suits me. However, I will up and leave when, where and if I please. Now, if you do n't mind me asking you, where the hell is my God damned bed? In the stable, where you belong. What are you doing, Mother? = Hvad laver du, Mor? = I 'm sweeping. = Jeg feje. = You see I 'm sweeping. Why? = Hvorfor = Why are you sweeping? = Hvorfor feje du? = God is in our house. = Gud er i vores hus. = Our house was always clean. Mom, you 've lost your mind. Soil is made of dust.

Just cobs... just bare old cobs. - I know it. - The wheat and goats are dead. I know that. What do you know? Are you crazy? Pull up here. Whoa. - You better lock me in the wagon. - Why? Well, I cheated one rope I do n't wan na change to another. - Them sons of bitches 'll try to hang me again. - Oh, you might be recognized. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?

Well, then, I wo n't go East with you! Goodbye, Cuddy! - What 's your name? - That 's my business. I 'm going to the bank and I need your name. Oh, well, we 'll say " George ".

It 's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Sours. She wo n't say nothin ', Miss Cuddy, she just sets and looks out the window. It 's like her body 's all stoved-up. I have to carry her to the outhouse, undress her nights, dress her in the morning. How long she been like this? Ever since... I do n't even know her no more. How old is your wife? Nineteen. - And you? - Twenty one I see. My, but she was beautiful, Miss Cuddy. She may be once again. Mr. Briggs, will ya winter-up your leisure long enough to lend a hand? Now! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... there 's this, too. Her grandma 's wedding gift, I reckon it should go with her. I 'll keep it for her and see she takes it home.

Just go on home and play with that damn doll. Leave me up against it. You do n't love me? - G'bye. - Go on, get, you can just go to hell. G'bye! You do n't love me. Good morning, Mr. Svendsen.

I need help, surely you understand! He was suppose to hang. - Mr. Svendsen. - Get down off that wagon. Get down off that wagon right now, or I will shoot you where you sit. I ca n't do this alone, I need him, now you leave us be! Get us moving. You boys did n't have balls to hang me! You wanted my horse to do it for you, did n't ya? C'm on! Let 's go.

Mrs. Svendsen, I asked you to stop. Please do! Stop! Mrs. Svendsen, stop! Do you think these mules 'll make it all the way to the Missouri river? I doubt it, not without a good feeding of corn. The one flicking ' her ears, she knows she 's the subject of our discussion. She 's a thinker, the other one 's a worker. They should have names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need names, they need feed, and corn 's the best there is. I 'll name that one Grace, and that one Redemption. My mare, her name 's Dorothy, after my sister. She 's married to a doctor up in New York state, that 's where we 're from. Dorothy has a little 6 year old boy and a baby on the way. Our mother died when we were little girls. What 's your horse 's name? Brown. You did n't give me the two damned skinny blankets, it gets cold at night out here! You noticed. We need to head south-east, follow the river bottoms. No. We 'll meet more people that way in case we need help. Ya know, only three kinds of people out here, you gon na meet wagon trains that do n't want to see crazy people. You gon na meet freighters who will surely rape you, and you gon na meet Indians who 'll kill ya... and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gon na go straight east to the river. We 're haulin ' an odd lot of freight. They are not freight, they are human beings. - They 're crazy. - They are precious to the Lord. Precious to me, too. Give me that skillet, about $300 worth. Wake up! Time to get moving! Get up and go pee! C'm on there, girl. Watch your head on the hub there, baby, c'm on. C'm on. There ya go. Pee. God damn! Squat down. Squat down! Now pee! God... will strike you down. God will strike you down. I love trees. I do n't get to see very many trees... I miss them. God will strike you... New York... has lots of trees. Surely you would n't defile and desecrate. You are horrible... and morbid! I do n't wan na be cold anymore when I 'm trying to sleep. I need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in the Dragoons. Company C, 1st. U.S. Division. Fort Kearney. Had us a right smart scuffle one time down there in Kansas with them God damned Kiowas! - Tell me. - We were headed out to Fort Leavenworth. Supply train, 6 mule wagons and a herd of 300 horses. And we had Kiowas like flees trailing us! War paint, sassy, big as life and twice as natural. - Wanted them horses. - I see. Well, we camped down on the Arkansas River one night, and them teamsters picketed 36 mules and they picketed 300 horses in the sand. Sand, hell, them picket pens would n't hold a prairie dog in that sand. Sure enough, that night, Kiowas come through there and stampeded the whole bunch and away they went. Trampled the wagons all to pieces, got the stock all tangled up in the ropes, and crippled-up with the flying picket fence, and them Kiowas just running through there hooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't we riled? We blew the bugle... boots and saddles and away went after ' em with the sun risin '. We caught Kiowas here and we caught Kiowas there, and we caught ' em in bunches and killed every one of ' em. We rounded up our stock and drove it right through the middle of the God damned Kiowa camp... tore it all to hell. Pretty fair job of work... Company C 1st U.S. Dragoon! Well, how interesting.? I do n't want none o ' your weevily wheat, I do n't want none o ' your barley.?? I 'll take some flour and half an hour and bake a cake for Charley.?? The higher up the cherry tree, The sweeter grows the cherry.?? The more you hug and kiss a gal The more she 'll want to marry.?? Charlie, he 's a fine young boy Charlie, he 's a dandy.?? Every time he goes town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are they? - Pawnee, probably. - What was that? - Bugle. Somewhere along the line they killed themselves a U.S. cavalry bugler. - What do they want? - Whatever we got. The trouble is they do n't know what that is... they 've never seen a wagon like this. Could be goods inside, soldiers, anything to them, hell, they do n't know. I count four rifles amongst ' em. If they think we 're worth the trouble, we 're dead. I 'll try to buy ' em off. Something happens to me, they come all the way down here, do n't you fool with that carbine. You get in the wagon quick as you can, you shoot the women in the head, then shoot yourself. You got four good rounds. C'm on, turn around here. C'm on, turn around here. Get outta here! - What will they do with Dorothy? - They 'll probably eat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone, Mr. Briggs! Mr. Briggs, she 's gone. She 's gone, we have to get her back! - Cuddy, it was a God dammed horse. - Get up, you lout. She has n't taken a step by herself since we put her on the wagon. Hells Bells. That gal done run off. - Morning! - Morning! Where you from, friend? Freight train, camped down south a little ways. - Big, eh? - Thirty wagons, six yolk. Two weeks ago outta Fall City headed for Salt Lake. - You the driver? - I am, out hunting ' meat, you seen any? No not today, I 'm out looking for this young lady here. - She 's lost. - She ai n't now. Friend, I got a frame wagon back there, I 'm carrying three crazy women to a church in Iowa so they can go home back East. This young girl is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sours. She had three little children, and lost ' em all to the diphtheria... in short order and she lost her mind. She run away from us last night. - I 'm her friend. - So am I. So you would n't wan na her not to waste you here. She can spread her legs, ca n't she? I can tell you what, why do n't we leave it to her. See here sweet thing, who 'd you rather go with, him or me? Well, there you be, she caught me stunned me already. - Friend, I 'm taking this girl home. - Not likely, she 's mine now. Possession is nine points of the law, and it 's all of us out here now, ai n't it? - Sorry, I 'll just have to have her. - God Almighty! Fight you for her. Best man takes the prize, how 's that? - I 'm agreeable. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pitch these guns, how 's that? Anytime. Pitch! God Almighty! - Say it again and act right this time. - Pitch! Goodbye. Did you have to take an eternity? She 's nearly froze to death. You lost one horse, Cuddy, here 's you another one. - Who did you get this horse? - Man let us have him. - Why would he do that? - Because he was dead, Mrs. Sours shot him. - Who would do such a thing? - Indians... for the clothes. Wolves. " Cissy Hahn, eleven years, two months, nine days. " " God loved her and took her home onto Him. " Let 's go, Cuddy. I intend to tidy up this grave. - Getting late. - I do n't care. Well, suit yourself, I 'm goin ' home. Then, I 'll take a horse and join you later. Not mine you wo n't. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shovel, too. Oh, Sweet Merciful Father, Prince Jesus, Good Shepherd, Harvester of righteousnesses, take thee this token and bury them deep, carry in... carry in, in love let us sleep. Send me summons to wed Thee one day. Love us, and love me, Oh, love me, I pray. Amen. Why, why, why did you light a fire for me? What about supper? I did light a fire for you, Cuddy. Where 's that shovel? I lost the goddamn shovel! Who cares about a shovel? - You... are... insane! - The hell I am, Cuddy. I 'm tryin ' to move a load to the river quick as I can and draw that $300. And that 's all there is! There ai n't no more.? If I should prosper,?? Hear my heart pray,?.? Send me a summons to wed thee one day.?? Take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I should perish, Thy promises keep.?? Take thee our two hearts and bury them here.?? Take Thee our tokens and love let us sleep.? - I could n't sleep. - I could. How long now ' til we get there? A week... thereabouts, maybe a month, hell, I do n't know. It 's almost over now. We stay in Iowa or come back to the territory? I do n't know. - You 're not much for makin ' plans. - No, not much. Mr. Briggs, you 're an intelligent man. And if you think on it, I 'm sure you will see the wisdom in it. After we 've turned them over to Mrs. Carter, why do n't we marry and come back together? I 'm 31 years old, if I 'm ever to marry, it better be soon, and you 're not getting any younger. You 've seen my house and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bank... I 'm in good health and capable of child bearing... I plan to buy shoats next spring and fatten ' em on corn... and come summer I 'll have 60 acres into wheat. I plan to put in pumpkins, too. We 'd make a good team you and I. If we pull together, we 're bound to prosper, do n't you agree? - No, I ai n't no farmer. - Well you could try... you could try. I tried it one time with a widow woman up north of Wamego. Up and down them God dammed rows daylight ' til dark. There 's prettier things to look at than the ass end of an Ox. One morning I just rode off. You deserted her. When I left I was sorry, but I never did look back. I see. So you wo n't marry me? - No, I won't. - I know, I 'm plain as an old tin pail. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with me about it again? Talk 's cheap. Mr. Briggs, perhaps you do n't realize what a grand thing you 're doing taking these poor helpless women home. If you do n't, I assure you the good Lord does and I do. This might be the finest, most generous act of your life. It might be $300. - You wo n't marry me? - No. Then I am plain. I wish you 'd say one kind word to me. Like what? That I 'm a good woman, that I 've helped you. Fair enough, you 're a damn good woman, Cuddy, and you 've helped me. I deserted from the Dragoons. That 's right, Company C 1st U.S., Fort Kearney, stoled a horse and away I run. I ai n't attached to nothin ', Just me. No. - I want to lie with you. - No. - You must, I saved your life. - No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raise your knees. Take me in your hand. Just you remember Cuddy, I did n't force you. - I will. - If I hurt you, - I ca n't help it. - I know. - You asked me, I did n't ask you. - I know. - So let me in you. - Yes. Cuddy? Cuddy! My God in Heaven, Cuddy, we made a deal to carry these women back to Iowa, and I kept my word and here you done and broke yours. See here? You see what you 've done? You killed her. Look at her! You killed her! You 're too damned crazy to pay attention to anything, you God damned lunatics! You do n't know nothing about this world. Ca n't even piss straight. Had n't been for you, Mary Bee would n't be dead. She would n't even be out here! If you had n't gone crazy, she wouldn't 've made this trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be alive, and at home, in her own house. And so would you, but no, you went crazy... and drove her crazy and it killed her, what do you got to say about that? Da. Well, I 'll be. I 'm goin ' on by myself. You 're on your own. Far enough along near East where somebody 'll come along and tend to you. There ai n't a damn one of ya can understand a word I 'm saying. Oh, my God. How do? Been carrying ' three women outside, had n't had anything to eat for three days. They need supper now, rooms for the night and a hot baths. We 're fill up. - With what? - People. Mister I did n't come in here for trouble, but I am tired. When I 'm tired I 'm easy to aggravate. Now this is a hotel, I 've got money, I want supper now, then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for three women, and I want four baths or the reason why not. Wait here a minute. - Greetings! - How do? My name is Aloysius Duffy, - and yours is? - Briggs. I understand you 're in need of a meal and accommodations, Mr. Briggs. That 's right, for myself and 3 passengers, women. Oh, what an unusual cargo, I must say. In any case, Mr. Briggs, I regret I can not oblige you. - Why not, this is a hotel, ai n't it? - Have a drink on the house. Grant. There she went. Now then, Mr. Briggs, you couldn'ta shown up at a more inauspicious time. It so happens a party of 16 potential investors is coming from St. Louis by steamboat and coach. I trust you recognize, we can not accommodate anyone else. These are gentlemen of means and the fate of our entire venture may very well depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to get here. And they ai n't had nothin ' to eat for 3 days. I 'm sorry. The women are in bad shape, they 're... awful hungry. Let me see them. Good God. - You ca n't turn us away. - I ca n't. Mr. Briggs, those women are pitiful, I concede. But we ca n't have ' em here tonight, the milk of human kindness be damned. Now, kindly, be out the door and take that wagon away from here. And God speed to ya. The shoe 's on the other foot now, you put them guns down on the floor real careful and get us our supper on the table right God damned now. Shoe 's back where it belongs, Mr. Briggs. Grant, well done. Be on your way, my friend. And lament your neglect at my offering a whiskey. Why? And I 'll tell you why... you are the worst bunch of lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever run into. You turn your back on these poor women you 'll answer for it for the rest of your lives. You wo n't sleep, you 'll choke on your whiskey and on your water. The food you eat will block up your bowels, you 'll die of your own shit. Your mothers and your sisters, and your wives and your daughters will curse your broke dicks old. Get on! Get on! Hyah! Hyah! Get on! Get on! Get! Go on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Oh, for God 's sake. Come on! Come on! Come on! Jaw! Get on there, mule! Go on! Get on! Get on! I 'm gon na go get us somethin ' to eat. Now you all be good girls and go to sleep, I 'll be back directly. You need to get on outta here. Do n't look back, daughter. Son of a bitch! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks ridiculous, with... Pardon, Ma'am, I 'm looking for a woman by the name of Altha Carter, do you know where her house is at? - That would be the Minister 's wife? - Yes, Ma'am, that 's right, it would be. Go on down to the Methodist church. The house across the street, that 's the parsonage. All right, Ma'am, thank you. Come, Maisy, do n't look at him. Sir? Afternoon, Ma'am, are you Mrs. Altha Carter, the wife of the Methodist Minister? - I am. - Well, Ma'am, my name is Briggs. I 'm from the Territories, Loup, and I 've brought you 3 women. Women? Oh. Oh, for goodness sakes, yes! You have been a long time coming, Mr. Briggs, I am relieved you 're here. I 'm... I 'm sorry Reverend Carter is n't. He is out burying a beloved member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman named Cuddy was bringing them. That 's what Reverend Dowd wrote. She was with us up to a week ago, Ma'am. I 'm sorry to tell you that a fever took her. I buried her and we moved on. Mary Bee Cuddy... was her name. Oh, what a... terrible loss. She must have been a fine, brave human being. She truly was. They 've ridden all this way... in that box? Oh, Mercy! Well... it 's time to meet them. I 'm not sure I 'm ready. Get over there. - You must have had an awful winter. - We did, Ma'am. Put them on the settee, Mr. Briggs. - Do they speak? - No. - Do they understand anything? - Ma'am, I do n't know. I noticed their eyes move ' round the room, what does that mean? That 's hard to tell. Perhaps each remembers a parlor... from her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any improvement in their condition? They do n't scrap with each other and try to run off anymore. Tell me their names. - This Theoline Belknap, she killed her baby. - Oh, no, no, no! Please do n't tell me, Mr. Briggs, I do n't care to know. That one there is a Norski woman by the name Gro Svendsen. - Very well. - And that 's Arabella Sours. She 's only a girl, why, she even have a doll. She had 3 little children, lost ' em all to the diphtheria in 3 days. Dear Lord! Please do n't say anymore. There 's letters on all 3 of ' em in this bag here, about their kin folks and all. I better move on. They might just jump up and try t'follow me. I think this room will hold them. Oh! I almost forgot. This is for you, Miss Sours. It 's lovely. Maybe you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ladies. God bless you. They 'll be all right. I want to say goodbye to you. You can give this wagon and those mules and that plaid horse and everything else to the Methodist Women. Maybe they can sell everything, use the money to pay for railroad fare and whatever else. Mr. Briggs! I 'm delighted! How very generous of you. Tell the Reverend to give those mules a good feeding of corn. - Will you go back to the Territory? - I do n't know. If you do, please thank Reverend Dowd for me and wish him well. Yes, Ma'am. Well then... this is our goodbye, Mr. Briggs, give me your hand. God Our Father, bless this good man, wherever he may go. Keep watch over him. Cause thy face to shine upon him, and bring him home to Thee one day. In Jesus ' name I pray, amen. I hope we meet again, Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, yes, Sir. Looks better, Sir. - How old are you? - Sixteen. You ai n't got no shoes or nothin ' on your feet. Well, that 's my business ai n't it? I 'll take them shoes, right there. You 're playing high stakes, Sir, can you show $50? There 's $300... for ya. - Mind if I have a look? - Suit yourself. Have a look at this, Mr. Carmichael. Bank of Loup, up near Wamego. How long since you 've been there, Sir? Five... six weeks. Bank of Loup went bust. Happens all the time to sod-buster banks in the Territory. I 've lost more than my fair share of this wild-cat paper. You have any greenbacks? No, I spent it all. I 'm sorry, Sir, I can not accept these banknotes. Nobody around here will. Sorry, but you ca n't sit at the table unless you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave. - What? Please leave the table, Sir. You are not socially acceptable here, see? You ever know a woman by the name Mary Bee Cuddy? No, Sir. These are for you. You still got ta pay your bill. That gravy and them biscuits you made was pretty good. Thank you. I got ta good piece of advice for you. When you get grown, do n't marry some shitty old kid headed West to make a claim on a farm he ai n't built yet. Do n't do that, you stay here. - Why? - Because I told you to. - Who is Mary Bee Cuddy? - Mary Bee Cuddy... was just a fine a woman as ever walked. - You 'll never know her. - Well, then, so what? So what? You are the living, breathing reason she will never be lost. That 's " what ", darlin '. - You 're a strange man. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we marry? Maybe. Haul away! Pull up them shorelines! - Yeah, I 'm good when your are. - Shove off! Hang on, by the left. - Hang on, walk it down, walk it down. - I got it. - All right, we 're movin '. - I see... take it down, boys, take it down. - Let ' er catch up. - Lead it out.? Take her by her lily white hand,?? Lead her like a pigeon.?? Make her dance the Weevily Wheat, scatter her religion.? You boys know the Weevily Wheat? - Hell, yeah. - Get on up here? Oh, Charley, he 's a fine man, Charley, he 's a dandy.?? Every time he goes to town, he brings his gal some candy.? Hush up that noise, there 's people here trying to sleep! You sons of bitches! We are headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for God damned Navy.? Oh, Charley, he 's a fine man, Charley, he 's a dandy.?? Every time he goes to town, he brings his gal some candy.?? Charley here and Charley there, Charley over the ocean.?? Charley 'd never pass a train... if he do n't see motion.? Clap your hands.
