5221141 Oh, here comes Daddy. How do I look? - Terrific, Mom. - Good. You know, every payday I like Daddy to see what his last check went for. Assume the position. Hi. Nice to see you. Good to be back. If anyone needs me, I 'll be on the couch. Goodbye. So long. Do n't write. Do n't call. Al, perhaps you did n't see us. I think he 's playing dumb. No, honey. I 've known him for years. He 's not playing. - Where 's the money, Al? - I got robbed. I was driving home and I drove by the bank, and the street was cordoned off. So I knew I should n't get out of the car, but I did and that 's when they jumped me. - Muggers, Al? - Worse. Bankers. Bill collectors, electric-company reps that wiry little woman from the water company. They were all there. They threw me down, forced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will. I felt so violated. But I fought like a wildcat and I think I felt a toe snap when I bit through that water-company babe 's penny loafer. And that gas guy 's gon na be reading meters out of one eye for a while. Well, you know, this is my own fault. The organ grinder who owns the monkey does n't let him have the check. You 're the organ grinder, all right. Hey, what 's this? Well, it was my handkerchief. Here, boy. Good boy. Hey, kids, look at this. It 's a brochure announcing a monthly shoe-sales contest. And the winner gets a free first-class trip to Hawaii. Well, that 's fine for the winner, but what would Dad get? So you bowel-constricting vampires I call loved ones think I could n't possibly be a winner, huh? - No. - Not really. Oh, sure, I pulled the handle on the slot machine of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cherry. But I was a high school hero. And I can do it again. Any man who can score four touchdowns in a single game after a night with your mother is surely capable of new glory. Al Bundy will win this contest and go to Hawaii. - First class. - How come the winner... -... only gets one ticket? - Otherwise he 'd have to take his wife. Where 's the incentive there? Here he comes. He 's coming in for a pit stop. Sold 24 pair of shoes, and I 'm in third place. Shower me. Squeegee me. Shoe me. Fratella 's in second place, but I can take him. He goes home at night to visit his wife. The sap still loves her. Luckily I do n't have that problem. No time for frivolity. Freshen me. Shirt me. Shoe me. Get away from me. I am now ready to sell. That should be Marcie coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking a shower and someone broke in and stole all my shoes. How odd. I only hope that this is not a night in which you need shoes. Well, you know she does, Al, I told you. We have a big, important dinner with the bank president, remember? Marcie was in the shower, you told me my hair was a mess so of course, I ran off to fix it. When I came back, you were gone. You must have just missed the burglar. Anyway, hey, how 's my hair? Soft, yet manageable. Now, Marcie, as a friend who 's also in the business let me fix you up with a nice pair of shoes. Now, just sit down right here and put your feet in my hands. You 're not gon na look up my dress, are you? I 'm not going through the rest of my life blind just to sell you shoes. Now, here, let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-inch heels, which, by coincidence match your dress exactly. - They 're perfect. I 'll take them. - Fine. That 'll be $500. Five hundred dollars? Well, they came in a six-pack. Apparently, they were a family of cats and we were asked not to separate them. But trust me. They were n't killed for shoes. They were all run over by cars. That must be where they get Hush Puppies. Oh, spare me. Just give me the shoes. I 'm tired of looking at myself in your head. Come on, Jefferson, we 're late. And remember, after dinner when they serve the cigars and brandy you go in the other room with the wives. All right, but I better get a phone book for my pants because every time it 's the same thing. The lights " accidentally " go out and I 'm the helpless victim of a gang-goose. Look, those people are important to my career. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, come on. I need some help. The wind has picked up. Could be disastrous for my hair. You know. Mom. You know what I 'm thinking? That we should go upstairs and split up Marcie 's shoes? No, I was just wondering what I was thinking, because I forgot. Hi, Dad. - This is Petal. - It 's part of a flower. Is n't she great? I met her in Quantum Physics. Hold my calls. There never are any, son. Never mind that now, Dad. See you tomorrow. Young lady! Young lady, you do realize that 's my son 's bedroom you 're going to? Yes. Hey, nice shoes. Dad, do n't. Come on, Dad. Dad, no. Come on, Bud. Get over it. What is one girl in the grand scheme of your life? Just your only chance. Oh, come on, you 're not alone in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fine. And neither has Mom. And lately, neither has your father. Family. Bask in the glory. I did it. I won the contest. You 're looking at the shoe salesman of the month. I 'm going to Hawaii. First class. And you know what they have in first class? Unlimited peanuts. And a passenger-lavatory ratio of only six to one. Gee, I 'm gon na miss you guys. Well, hang onto your haemorrhoids, honey. I have news for you. I called the airlines and there 's been a change of plans. I traded your first-class ticket in for four standbys. We 're all going to Hawaii together. And, Dad it was my idea. Oh, that was so smart. Well, standby is n't too bad. I mean, how long can they possibly make us wait? Well, I checked on Seven. Marcie found him where we left him. In her guest room. She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that happen when she 's in the shower. - Well, what about Buck? - Oh, I took care of that. I opened up six cans of dog food and I told him to only eat one each day. And I could tell by the way he dug into that first can that he understood completely. Some man or men are gon na be very lucky to have you one day. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. In the first-class lounge the champagne is now 42 degrees. And, as always, unlimited peanuts are now being served. First class. Champagne. Peanuts flowing like wine. That was supposed to be me. Welcome to the first-class lounge. May I see your ticket, sir? This is standby. You embarrass me and yourself. - Excuse me. - Hey. It 's John Sebastian. Believe in magic, buddy. I seem to have lost my ticket. Oh, it does n't matter, Mr. Sebastian. We know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlimited. Life is good. I should have said I lost my ticket. Would n't have done any good. You 're not a rock star. Oh, Richie Havens. Welcome, sir. Spencer Davis. Good to see you. Robby Krieger. I love the Doors. - Mark Lindsay, always a pleasure. - Thank you. Peter Noone. Please come in. Hey, man. Groovy there. Right on. Peace, love and women should n't have to cook, man. Dig it, I 'm hip. Try to keep the groupies off me if you can. Excuse me, excuse me. - Ticket, please. - Well must 've left it in the limo. Rock ' n ' roll always forgets. I 'm sorry, sir, but I do n't recognize you. You 'll need a ticket. Sebastian. John, my man. Come here. Hey, how you doing? How they hanging, fellow rock bro? Well, let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. Axle. Axle Bundy. You know, from- From Shoes and Socks, remember? San Francisco, 1969. I do n't remember too much about 1969. Who does? But seriously, you must remember me from the big concert last year. Live Aid. Lemonade. Kool-Aid, Ice Capade. One of those. Yeah, I remember. Peter, look who 's here. Who 's he? Axle Bundy? Oh, Axle, great. Hey, I 'm a big fan. I 've got one of your records. You remember the one that sold. Have you still got that tambourine-playing wife in your band? Still screeches horrible backup vocals. Hey, you must be-Just call me yours. Yeah, and we 're Bombshell and Troll. Hey, fab. Hey, come on in. Unlimited peanuts for all in here. Hey, you got something on your tie-Sandwiches. Could you imagine living like this all the time? No wonder Fergie 's such a piglet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it? Living it up with the geezers of rock. Speaking of geezers son, have you seen your mother? No, but if she 's anywhere on this stewardess, I 'll find her. You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband. You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband. You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband. You are who I think of when I-When I clean up the floor around the toilet. Hey, Axle, come on and join us over here. We 're jamming. Yeah, come on, man. It would n't be a jam without... Who is that guy? The name 's Awful Grungy or something. I do n't - I do n't know him. But I know that 's Peggy, and I believe we all remember her. I think I remember him. Did n't he use to be the fifth Monkee? Hey, Ankle, we 're waiting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never play at home. Oh, I do n't know. - Hey, fellow rock bros. - Hey. - I just had me a groupie. - All right. Hey, why do n't you jam with us. Come on, Al, for old time 's sake. Hey, man, where 'd you learn to play pastrami like that? A little after-hours deli on the South Side. Wild, man. You got cold cuts in your blood, man. By the way, a little mustard on your pants. Flight 107 to Tucson now boarding Gate 4A. That 's us. Let 's go. Well. Come on, time to go. Say goodbye to first-class Axle and hello to standby Al. Hey, Axle. Where you going? Forgot my ticket. Ticket? You do n't need a ticket. Everybody knows you. Yeah, come on. We got the whole first-class compartment all to ourselves. And we 're doing a benefit and we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah, there are n't many bigger stars than you Maxwell. Come on, we need your blue-eyed, bad-wigged soul. Gee, why not, Al? It 'd be just like singing in the shower. If you sang. Or showered. Come on. Oh, all right. Let 's go. Wait a second, wait a second. I need Lucille. - Take no prisoners. - Peanuts! All right. And now, as promised the world premiere of the superstar video for Old Aid. We are the old We 've got arthritis - Our gums are weak - So weak From gingivitis We are the old We 've got arthritis We are the ones who wear bifocals And have bursitis There are people younger But we heed another call We really need the money Our accountants took it all We sing to you Those who have money Once we was cool But now we just dress funny We need your help So please, please dig deep Do n't call after 10 ' Cause we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your help We ca n't pay our alimony bills Take it, Axle.
