The kid 'll never even know. Oh dude, that istits! That is big fat oprah tits, right there! Oh my god, what if i 'm not real? We can take the bus to the city There 's super-Rich people down there.

Told you, dude, Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet these kids get 10 bucks a tooth From the " tooth fairy ". Hey, that house looks perfect! There 's obviously kids living there. Here, you can tell this is the kids 's window ' Cuz it 's gotmegaman stickers on it. Cartman, once you 're in the kid 's room, Leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We 'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, Then swing you back in to grab it. Got it. This is the smartest business venture, ever! What the-? Hey, what the hell are you guys doing? We 're gon na sneak a tooth under this rich kid 's pillow Then come back and take the tooth fairy money That his parents leave him. Hey, you ca n't do that! Why not? Because that 's what we 're going to do! Yeah, you ripped off our idea. What the hell are you talking about? We 've been doing this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume! You think anybody 'd believe you in that? It 's better than your dress! You look like a bad jennifer lopez nightmare. How dare you! Look, this is our turf, You better scram before the boss breaks your legs. You scram, we were here first! What 's going on? Oh, it 's the tooth fairies! Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up. Youwoke him up! I do n't have any loose teeth, miss fairies. But i have been a very good boy. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Alright, that does it! C'm on we 're going to see the boss! Who 's the boss? Loogie. My associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight. Is that true? Uh, yeah. Right on our turf, boss, I ai n't never seen that kinda disre-We were there first! Kids been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years I do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest brother before that. Damn it! And we thought we were so original! Let me ask you something, You were gon na sneak a tooth under this rich kid 's pillow? Then what? What do you mean? How were the kid 's parents going to know There was a tooth under their child 's pillow? Ha! You guys do n't even know How the tooth trade works! What 's the tooth trade? Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window Wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. We keep careful track of what houses we 've hit So we do n't hit the same ones twice in less than 2 months. We not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow But leave a note for mom and dad to see. This is how we let the parents know To leave money under the pillow. Once the notes have been placed in the last house, We start all over, going back to the first house. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect money. And the kids never know what hit ' em. Wow! Wow! Wow! The hardest part is getting teeth. We 've tried various places... Cemetaries... Hockey games... Anywhere we can find them. No! The teeth we do manage to acquire Are then sorted according to size, color and quality. But there 's never enough teeth... Never enough. Amazing! Man, that is tits! And now my only problem is : What do i do with you? Raarr! Tell you what, how would you like to Run the south park tooth racket for me? Oh, i do n't know. It 's that or i can cut off you penises. Hmmm, work for you, or have my penis cut off. Work for you, or have my...? Cartman! How much do we get if we work for you? I 'll cut you in at 2% 2% or have my penis cut off...? We 're in! Fellow dentists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports Of missing teeth from all over the country There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. A giant half-Chicken, half-Squirrel That steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep In order to build some kind of a giant nest For its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring. We believe also, That this creature would have at least a mild understanding Of algebra. Uh, excuse me, i think i have a more logical theory. Well, by all means, mr. Foley, enlighten us. I think what we 've got here is a black market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth From another group for a profit. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Oh, mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds. It 's not ridiculous, it 's very possible! I 've seen it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! And where, pray, is this mon-Tree-Al? Look, i know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin And the rest will fall. You 'll see, i 'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks. Very well, mr. Foley, you go on your wild goose chase! And meanwhile, we 'll deal with therealproblems at hand. I will! Anyway, the half-Chicken half-Squirrel Would most likely be 3 to 4? feet tall His large beak is probably detachable And works as a flotation device. Hello there, children! Hey, chef! Hey, chefhey, chef! We all want double desserts today! Oh, well, i 'm afraid that the school charges extra for that. Oh yeah well, that ai n't nothin ' but athang. Oh my god!
