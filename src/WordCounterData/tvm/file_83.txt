5225241 Previously : You look like you could use a client. Wan na work for the leader of the free world? Our job approval 's 48%, and I think that number 's soft. I 'm tired of being a captain for the gang that could n't shoot straight. You ran great guns in the campaign. Then you drove to the middle of the road the moment you took the oath. I wanted a Democrat, and instead I got you. Leo, there are times when we are absolutely nowhere. - It looks like it 's gon na rain. - It 's overcast. Is n't that usually what it is before it rains? - But in this case? - It 's gon na rain later. - If it rains, change the opening line. - It 's not gon na rain until maybe 2:00. If you 're wrong, you got ta change the line. This is n't from morning radio. This is from Lt. Emily of the Coast Guard who would n't let me down. She has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wrong, if the Coast Guard is wrong the remarks open with : " As I look out over this magnificent vista. " If it gets moved indoors, he wo n't be looking out over a vista of any kind. You think he ca n't change it, that he would n't know where he is? This is n't major. This is the United Organization of Trout Fishermen. If it 's moved... I got it from the U.S. Coast Guard. They use satellites. They use technology. This is the same technology we use to detect ballistic missiles, right? Yeah. - All right. - We should move it inside. Sam says it wo n't rain until later. Have you heard about a paper going around? - What paper? - I do n't know. Dave Trillin asked what I knew about a piece of paper going around. I have n't heard. - You should find out. - Good advice. We 're in the auditorium. - Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago. The weather report called for rain. - It did? - Yeah. Is it possible Lt. Emily is yanking me around? - Where 's the president? - How 's his mood? He had breakfast. He seemed upbeat, energetic, optimistic. How long will that last? Can we hurry so I can go preside over a civilization gone to hell? Nice talk. You know what this is? Your mood, sir. - Nothing wrong. - It 's your diet. You need roughage. I 'd like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. Your immaturity about vegetables is n't presidential. - Who has my remarks? - Sam 's bringing them. Is Toby on his way? Why are n't they here now? They did n't know it was raining. Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best. - Good morning. - You did n't know it was raining? To our credit, we knew it was raining once it started. - Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now? - An organization of trout fishermen. - Seriously. Give me the speech. There are anecdotes about fishing. - Have I ever been fishing? - Probably not. - Morning. - What 's going on? The CBO is gon na revise its projections two FEC commissioners resigned today... -... and the NGA endorsed trigger locks. - How much? The projections? Maybe 200 billion. Hang on. Two FEC commissioners resigned? There are two seats open on the FEC? This is interesting. This is not the best time for an idealistic... Two seats just opened on the election commission. - The Senate leaders will fill them. - What if we want our guys? - We wo n't win. - We can try. It 's not a good idea. You 're thinking about changing democracy. I 'm talking about dangling our feet. Get Leo two candidates who back campaign finance reform. I got ta stand with Leo on this. I 'm not saying jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Mr. President? - Yes? - Somebody? - United Organization of Trout Fishermen. Is your head gon na be in changing democracy? No, I 'm gon na be thinking about trout fishermen. - You felt better earlier. - Try a year ago. Does anybody know anything about a paper? - C.J., are you taller than usual? - I 'm my usual height. Could n't pick a trout out of a lineup. - Two FEC seats open on the same day? - Dream all you want. It wo n't happen. That 's what I thought, but after your pep talk.... Thank you very much. It 's good to see you. - Damn it! - What? I forgot to do something. As I look out over this magnificent vista.... How does the FEC work? Commissioners are in for six years. Two seats come up every two years. Two just resigned? How many times has that happened? Including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact campaign finance reform? - Do it, baby. - It 's not easy. When a vacancy comes up, the party leadership on both sides.... - Did you just call me " baby "? - Yeah. When a vacancy comes up, the president fills it. The party leadership on both sides always dictates who to appoint. One Republican, one Democrat. That 's how you keep the peace. - You 're gon na change it? - No, but I 'm gon na try. Come on, you 're trying to change democracy. You 're right. I 'll need a bagel. The Egg Hunt and the Egg Roll are different. This year 's theme is " Learning is Delightful and Delicious. " As, by the way, am I. The collection which will be on display here features eggs decorated by artists from each of the states. This is coordinated by the American Egg Board. I 've hung with some of the Egg Board cats, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it till this afternoon. - Steve? You got a second? - Sure. What have you heard about a paper that 's out there? Same thing you 've heard. There 's a piece of paper out there. - If you hear anything, you 'll tell me? - If I do, I 'll tell my editor. I keep forgetting you do n't work for me. - See you. - Bye. There 's a buzz in the room, about a paper... - Do you know anything? - I know everything. I wrote it. What is it? I wrote a memo for Russell, outlining strategy... - Excuse me, C.J.? - Katie, they 're in the Blue Room. When I worked for Russell, I wrote a memo outlining the Bartlet administration 's weaknesses and mapping out a strategy to defeat him for renomination. C.J., this is embarrassing and a little mortifying. But remember how mad I was... You worked for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In between, you wrote how to beat us? - I was working for Russell... I need to see a copy of it right now! Margaret! I ca n't e-mail. What 's the problem? Lynette, from the Council on Fitness, remember her? She 's the one where you say, " Who? " And I say, " Lynette from Fitness. " She sent me an e-mail about the number of calories in our raising muffins. I forwarded it to several hundred secretaries in the west wing. Jolene Millman, in Political Liaison, hit " reply, " which... Margaret, I 'm sorry. I 'm gon na have... I hung in there, but you passed the point when I stopped caring. If you 're curious, it was around " raisin muffin. " - I 'll leave you two alone. - Fix the e-mail. - Who 'd you find? - Bacon and Calhoun. I know Bacon. Who else? Patty Calhoun 's director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Republicans. - She favors campaign finance reform? - Aggressively. - The leadership will hate them both. - What do you want me to do? - Meet with the leadership offices. - You want me to meet with the leaders? No, meet their guys outside the building, over a meal. The president ca n't think we 'll get anywhere, can he? The president does n't think we 'll get anywhere, right? No. - What happened with the e-mail? - Has to do with the Fitness Council. - Who 'd you find? - Bacon and Calhoun. - Not in a million years. - What are you doing? It 's our turn with the boys. - Good luck. Do you want me to do the talking? - Why? - Just asking. Morning. Morning. We all know each other. Why do n't we sit down? We 've been meeting with various senior staff on the DOD, NSC, and House and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy inherited regarding gays in the military and we 'd like input before making recommendations to the president. - Can I interrupt for a moment? - Sure. What will come from your recommendation? Well, actually, it 'll be Sam 's recommendation to the president. I 'm just helping out. What do you think will be the consequence? Major, I would imagine the consequences to be little. I would imagine it to be very little. If the president orders that gays can serve openly that 's how it 'll be. Anyone who disobeys can stand court-martial. The president can give all the orders he wants. It takes an act of Congress to amend the Uniform Code which makes sodomy a crime. End of story. - I guess it 'll be a short meeting. - Yeah. There will be 25,000 wooden eggs and 7500 other eggs. What are the other eggs? - The other eggs are... - Real eggs. - Mandy 's waiting. - Where 's Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see him. - 25,000 wooden eggs. - Added to the 7500 eggs that are.... - They 're just regular eggs. - Right. Is that it? Yeah. Who has it? I do n't know. But somebody does. Yeah. Okay. I 'm gon na read it now. Go back to your office and do n't answer any questions. You 'll call me when you 're done reading? I 'd count on it. Soft money renders the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless. Soft-money contributions, which were designed for party building only eviscerate election controls. We are, by definition, corrupt. - I would n't say that. - No, but this money is n't 1 Os and 20s. It 's coming in in denominations of 100, 200, 500,000 dollars! It comes from special interests whose interests are n't the same as those who do n't have money. It 's going to issue ads and candidates. It 's called free speech. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can. If the airplane industry wants to back a candidate, they can. If big tobacco wants to wave a sign, they are free to do so. That 's free speech, money is n't. I like it when Josh comes here and teaches us a lesson we richly deserve. I came at the request of Leo McGarry. The president is strongly considering John Branford Bacon and Patty Calhoun to fill the two seats. We 've already got our guys. - It 's Kalen. - Grant Kalen and Joe Barkley. People who oppose any campaign finance reform. I thought you liked Kalen. He 's elected Democrats from Indiana. He 's raised money in Indiana. Barkley says people can spend whatever they want on politics. So does the Supreme Court. We ca n't do this every time Bartlet wants to make the world better. The party leadership 's gon na choose a Republican and a Democrat. That 's the way it 's been, the way it 's gon na be, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes. - The president makes FEC appointments. - The Senate confirms them. I 'm speaking for the majority leader. Embarrass us, and we 'll give the same back to you. Any legislation you want off the table will show up. Our greatest hits : 541, school prayer, family support, entertainment decency. - English as the national language. - That will be our leadoff hitter. - Why not just not confirm our guys? - We 'll do that too. In addition to voting down our nominees there will be retribution for nominating them? Yes. You know why? Because you know you 're gon na lose, and we 're gon na look bad winning. I reject maintaining free speech through government regulation. - Reject what you want. - What? Reject whatever you want. This was a fool 's errand for me and the president knew it. This was a test balloon, an " out of curiosity, what if " meeting. - But you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a caucus. We got ta go. - I 'm going to lunch. - The president wo n't eat his. Why is he dissatisfied? - It 's entirely vegetables. - It 's a salad. He 'd prefer a sandwich. Roast beef, pastrami, steak. He will eat it, and if he does n't like it, he knows where to put it. I do n't think I will tell him that, but I appreciate your help. - If it ai n't broke.... - " Do n't ask, do n't tell " works. It does n't. Want to know how much it does n't? - 1145 gays were discharged in 1998. - That 's a record. A 92% increase since " do n't ask, do n't tell. " 414 Air Force discharges, the highest in two decades. 271 of them during basic training at Lackland Air Force Base. - What 's going on there? - I do n't like your humor. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need Toby. Yeah. Come here a sec. You 're doing good. - What? - I know what the paper is. A strategy memo Mandy wrote. - Strategy to do what? - Beat us. - Did you read it? Is it bad? - Yeah. Let 's go to my office. How 'd it go? - How do you know to be here? - I see you out your office window. - Why are you in my office? - Looking for you out the window. How 'd it go? - It went fine. - Fine? You do n't want to say more? I do n't, and you know I do n't because I 'm not. - This is our time together. - I ca n't mess around. I need to be prepped on English as the national language. - Why? - Might come up. Because.... It does n't matter. If we do the FEC thing, English as the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or against it? We do n't favor another language, do we? Dutch or something. Did n't I just tell you I ca n't mess around? - Bullet points? Give me 30 minutes. - Thank you. Toby said to come by as soon as you got back. I 'm not taking any calls. I 'll call them back. " The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes. An agenda stalled and lacking a coherent strategy. An administration plagued by indecision. " - Ginger. - What 's going on? Mandy wrote a manual for Russell, and it 's out. I do n't know where. How bad is it? She takes us to town. We do n't look like rocket scientists, but we 're not. - Who is it bad for? - The president and Leo. - Who has this? - I 'm finding out. Do it quietly. Quickly. Whose paper is it in tomorrow? We have to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than our first, does it? No. - Does he have a minute? - He 's finishing with the chairman. They almost done? I 'll wait. You having problems with your e-mail? Support says the pipeline 's been flooded. It happened when I forwarded an e-mail to people and one tried to reply. E-mail boxes are clogged. Replies are automatically bouncing back and forth at subatomic speed. I 've passed the point where you 're interested, have n't I? Yeah. - Thank you, Fitz. - Thank you. - Good afternoon. - You here for me? Is the Philippines redundant? - It is. That 's the beauty of it. - You 'll have to convince him. - I will. - If you say so. - Who are those guys? - A meeting on gays in the military. - Why? - Sam 's trying to build a position. If he comes up with one, let me know. There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers are n't secure. - That explains that. - He wants to put A1-M1 s in Manila. - The president will say it 's redundant. - How much does it cost? - Not much. 20 billion. - So there 's gon na be a thing. - About what? Mandy wrote a memo for Russell, and someone 's got it. - Who? - C.J. 's finding out. That 's politics. She was playing for the other guys. Yeah. There 's some observations the president wo n't be wild about. I move him to the middle. The sense is that he 's aggressive and you take him to safe ground. Do n't worry about it. Do n't worry about it. - Want to see a copy? - No. Six pages on English as the national language. Stuff on James Madison... James Madison? I did n't ask for a damn social studies paper. - Do n't snap at me, Josh. - Donna... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for. Do n't snap. What 's wrong with everyone today? It 's been all day. Is it Mandy 's memo? No. Why is everyone walking around like they 've already lost? I was n't snapping at you. I did n't realize that you also gave me what I asked for. I thought you just gave me James Madison. Look at the James Madison. It 's gon na help you. Thanks. - How will Madison help you? - I do n't know. The president wants two reformers on the FEC. Onorato will retaliate with English as the national language. - The president wo n't look good. - Tell me what else I should know. The president wo n't look good fighting that one. You oppose flag burning, school prayer, gays in the military. Say no to this, and they 'll paint a picture... I understand, Mandy. Fine. I 'm just saying it 's my job to tell you that. Today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job is. I wrote an op memo. We 've written 20! - Ever hear of a burn bag? - They got it off my hard disk. Do you know who has it? Then there 's not much you can do. Do n't let the president debate English... It wo n't happen. The president wo n't nominate who he wants to the FEC. Why not? Because that 's not what we do. All right. - I 'll leave you alone. - Thanks. - Everyone 's feeling this way today? - Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Hang on. A lot of those cases... - This report, by the way... - We can read. We know the report. Lots of cases of gays being discharged came from voluntary statements. These are n't voluntary, not by any definition given by a court. It 's not voluntary if given to a therapist as in Corporal David Blessing 's case. It is not voluntary when it 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not when it 's made when asked, as in Officer Diane Kelli 's case. And it is not when it is coerced out through fear intimidation, death threats, and prosecution as in the case of Bob Kiddis, Kevin Keys and four sailors on the Essex. We 'll take care of our guys. - Your guys are looking for jobs. - Those were n't our guys. - Oh, my God. - Attention! - Good afternoon, Sam. - Mr. Chairman. - How do you do, admiral? - Good to see you. We have n't met. From Oregon. Percy Fitzwallace. - It 's an honor, admiral. - I imagine it would be. This is Chairman Fitzwallace. They wo n't speak until I speak to them. They 're well-trained. Stand easy. - This Danish for anybody? - Yes, sir. We 're discussing gays in the military? What do you think? - I said, what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm asking what you think. - We 're not prejudiced. - You just do n't want them serving. - No, I do n't. They pose a threat to discipline and cohesion. That 's what I think too. The military was n't designed as an instrument of social change. Problem is, they said that about me 50 years ago. Blacks should n't serve. It disrupts the unit. Know what? It did. The unit got over it and changed. I 'm an admiral and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Beat that with a stick. We 'll see you, Ken. Excuse me. Mr. Chairman. Just... Thanks for stopping in. You 're not gon na get anywhere. The president wanted some exploratory meetings. - I was hoping to find you. I wanted... - Hang on. - I wanted to ask... - Hang on. - Is it the Magna Carta...? - I 'm finishing a thought. I 'm finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is? - A strategy memo for Russell. - That 's right. You got ta know I do n't like exploiting our friendship and I do n't like taking advantage of any feelings you have for me. - You have them too. - I do n't. I need to be ready for this. - Do you know who has it? - Yes. Who has it? I do. You have it? You 're gon na write about it? - Sure. - Why? - Because it 's news. - It 's not news. Just because it 's entertaining! It 's news. The president 's media director wrote a memo to a party leader describing his weaknesses. People in the party buy my paper. They 'd like to know what Mandy thinks. - Mandy was n't working here then. - I do n't care where she was working! She 's a key player, and she says the president 's vulnerable. That may not be good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to write about Easter eggs... Fine. We 'll have a comment for you by day 's end. - None of this is our fault! - None of what? Mandy 's letter was pretty accurate. She was working for Russell. You knew why. Why did n't you ask her, " What are we doing wrong? " Because you knew what she 'd say. There was nothing you could do. You guys are stuck in the mud around here and none of it is the press ' fault. I know you 're frustrated. But that 's nothing compared to the people who voted for you. " We 'll have a comment for you by day 's end "? When I want the White House to comment on a story, I 'll ask for it. I have to do this work. - I 'd like to go on record... - There is no record. I have no objection to what somebody does in their own home. But when we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about... Why does being gay mean you ca n't keep your hands to yourself? And how can the armed forces lay claim to restraint in that area? Want me to get the file on sexual harassment in the DOD? I 've had enough of this. " Do n't ask, do n't tell, do n't pursue " is federal law. It takes an act of Congress to change. If the president was serious about changing it he would not send you in here with me and two junior DOD staffers. He 'd call his staff together and say, " I want a resolution in the House. I want 50 high-profile cosponsors. I want a deal right now. " - Has the president done that? - The president... Has the president done that, Sam? No. Okay, then. Is this meeting anything more than a waste of time? No. Okay, then. I.T. Support is now accusing me of being a hacker. They 're accusing me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trojan horse. I said no. I was simply telling people the raisin muffin calorie count was wrong. You do n't believe me, take one of those muffins down to the lab. - I 'll do that. - Will you? Get me a muffin. Use gloves. Slip it in a bag. I 'll send it to the lab. You 're mocking me now, are n't you? Yes. Come in. Margaret thinks the FBI 's gon na bust in here any minute. Got a second bit of bad news for you today. - You got new numbers? - Yeah. How bad is it? CNN/USA Today puts our job approval at 42%. We dropped five points. In a week? Unfavorables are higher for the first time. 54% of the country is likely to vote for a Republican in November. We dropped five points? We did n't do anything last week. I 'll say. Toby, when you start thinking about jumping ship, you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got Mendoza on the court. This president was elected with 48% of the vote. Without a mandate. - The majority voted for somebody else. - I do n't care. He was elected and sworn in. I was there at the time. It 's not the easiest circumstance... One victory is n't so bad. One victory stinks for an administration. It 's not the ones we lose that bother me. It 's the ones we do n't try for. And I 'm not too crazy about you questioning my loyalty. The president 's reading the memo. I wish you had n't done that. It 's gon na piss him off. - It 'll be in the paper tomorrow. - Did you find out who has it? - Danny. - And he 's writing it? - Right next to the poll numbers. - How do we drop five points? It happened. Let 's move on. I think the Senate will confirm Bacon and Calhoun. They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, their agenda is to force the president to be unpopular on everything. Like English as the national language. We 're not going to let it on the table. - We should n't be afraid... - He wo n't let it on the table. - Then we 'll take their FEC candidates. - As we always have. - What about you? - My meeting? It was the same meeting we 've been having for... It was fine. I 'm sorry to interrupt. - Who 's got this? - Danny Concanon. - Why am I finding out about this now? - We learned about it today. I really did wake up energized this morning. - I never go to bed that way. - I know. Just once I 'd like to end a day feeling as good as when it started. - Are you bothered by this? - The memo? Yeah. Yes. We 've heard it before. You drive me to safe ground. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Good. You drive me there. - What did you say? - And you know it. We 're in neutral because that 's where you say to stay. - You 're wrong. - I 'm not. You want to do this now? You came to my house, Leo, and you said, " Let 's run for president. " I said, " Why? " You said, " So you can say what you think. " - Where 'd that part go? - You tell me. I do n't see a shortage of microphones. What the hell were you waiting for? Everything you do says, " I do n't wan na be a one-term president. " - Did n't I say put our guys on the FEC? - No, you did not. No. You said, " Let 's dangle our feet in the water like we do when we want to look like we 're trying. " That 's a fascinating version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a fascinating version. You brought me in on teachers, on capital gains. You brought me in on China and on guns. From where? You 've never been out there on guns or teachers. You dangle, and I 'm the hall monitor. It 's my job to make sure nobody goes off too far. Josh goes to the Hill on campaign finance, he knows nothing will happen. Sam ca n't push " do n't ask, do n't tell " and everyone knows that. If I said to get aggressive on finance or gays in the military you 'd tell me, " Do n't go too far. " If you said be aggressive, I 'd say : " I serve at the pleasure of the president. " We 'll never know, because you wo n't... - I have! Nothing happens! - Want me to orchestrate this? You wan na see me mobilize these people who would walk into fire for you? These people who showed up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats because he dates your daughter. He was warned, " Do n't show up. You 're in danger. " He said, " I 'm going anyway. " You said no. Prudent or not prudent, this 21-year-old, at $600 a week, said : " I 'm going where I want to, because a man stands up. " Everyone 's waiting for you. I do n't know how much longer. I do n't want to feel like this anymore. You do n't have to. - I do n't wan na go to sleep like this. - You do n't have to. I want to speak. Say it to me. It 's more important than re-election. I want to speak. Say it again. This is more important than re-election. I want to speak now. Now we 're in business. We got our asses kicked, but it 's time to get up. Say it. More important than re-election. I want to speak now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You have a strategy for all this? What is it? I 'm gon na try that for a while. The ground game is n't working. We 're gon na put the ball in the air. If we 're gon na walk into walls, I want us running into them. What? Tell the Hill the president 's named his nominees to the FEC. We 're gon na lose some battles. We might even lose the White House. We wo n't be threatened by issues. We 'll put them front and center. We 'll raise the level of public debate in this country and let that be our legacy. That sound all right to you, Josh? I serve at the pleasure of the president. I serve at the pleasure of the president. I serve at the pleasure of President Bartlet. I serve at the pleasure of the president. Good. Let 's get in the game.
