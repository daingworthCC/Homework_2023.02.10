No. I mean " out " as in " out. " What? It 's just that your presentation was so dynamic. but then Will kept interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the direction we wan na take. We 'd like him gone. So. what are you saying? You expect me to sell out my business partner and best friend of 13 years for a scrap of foam rubber and a few measly shekels? How dare you. sir? How dare you? This is what we are prepared to offer. He 'll be gone by tomorrow. - Hey. Will. - Hello. Jack. - Whatcha reading? - A book. - Would I like it? - No. there 's nothing to color in. Look. I spoke to the investors after you left today... And? And... there 's something I should tell you. - Sit down. - I am sitting down. Okay. you do n't have to bite my head off! They said. um... they said... they need to think about it. They need to think about it. - Yeah. - Okay. Let me explain what that means. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why they 're saying no. Jack? Because of you. - Will. I do n't think -- - Exactly! You do n't think! I mean. first you start with that ridiculous song-and-dance number. with Hey. mon fr? re, with your derri? re Could use a little - - thpp. What the hell is that?! - You said to chime in. - Yes. but by " chime " I did not mean " The Bell of Saint Mary. " - Will. Listen -- - No. then - - then you bend over in front of Lawrence Weber. a grandfather of four and a large contributor to the Republican National Committee. and ask him to squeeze your happy heinie! Hey. I got a vibe from him. but that 's a whole ' nother story. And to top it all off. you produce... this - - this sad. obscene thing. this... butt puppet. Buttford happens to be our spokes-puppet. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. and then addressed people with it. They were laughing. You turned a meeting with my colleagues into Circus-O-Gay! All of this adds up to the fact that we 're not gon na get any financing. because people do not generally give large sums of money to crass. juvenile performing monkeys! Then how come they want me and not you? Because l - - what? Yeah. that 's right. They said you think too small. They want you out. They liked my vision. they liked my energy. they liked my passion. And they liked Buttford! They sent me here to fire you. So... now who 's the monkey. huh? Hi. I need some advice. Did you just walk across the hall like that? No. Actually. I put my bra on when I got to the door. ' cause I know how my girly parts embarrass you. I can handle it. I watch " Animal Planet. " Okay. I need help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon. So do I go... smarty turtleneck. hmm? Or... bold... cleavage blouse? - Well. they 're both fine. - Fine? I do n't know. Whichever one you like better. What?! Will. what is the point of having a gay best friend. if you 're not gon na dress me? What 's wrong with you? It 's just this whole Subway Tush thing. I did n't even want to get involved in the first place. as you may recall. I was trying to be a good friend. so I went to all the trouble of setting up all these meetings with these investors. and the whole thing blows up in my face. I just -- Jack sold me out. I 'll tell you that. Will. I-- I think he 's more than made it up to you. - What? How? - He 's resigning. - He 's what?! - Yeah. I spoke to him this morning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sounds crazy. but I was missing all these pantyhose. and I thought he might 've taken them. I was wrong. But anyway. that 's - - that 's what he told me. He 's resigning? I do n't - - why would he do that? He said because he loves you and he 's your friend and he does n't wan na do it without you. In fact. I think he 's doing it right now. Oh. my God. I - - he - - he ca n't do that. I love that he wants to. but... his Tush means everything to him. - I ca n't let this happen. - Wait a minute. Wait. wait! Hey. hey! - What about me? - Oh... this with this. change the lipstick. hair up and... here are your hose. So without Will. you guys do n't get Jack. - In conclusion. gentlemen. I resign. - Stop saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already been forcibly removed from. You stole this idea. Look. when you say it like that. of course it 's gon na sound bad. You told us you had a patent on this product. when in fact. the idea of the Subway Tush belongs to a Mr. Bjorn Stevenson. Hey. he said he was moving back to Sweden. Then again. he also said he could bench-press my weight. which led to a very painful breakup. I do n't think you understand. We 're seriously considering legal action. I know you are. but what am I? Gentlemen. please stop. Hey! I know what 's going on here and I 'm not gon na let it happen. I urge you. do not to accept this man 's resignation. - He 's only doing it out of love for me. - Will -- No. do n't. Please. Jack. let me say this. When you have the opportunity to go into business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your fingers. - Will. Iisten -- - Jack has... passion. He has vision and most of all Jack has originality. There is not an idea in this man 's head that is not fresh. unique -- - Shut up. Will. I stole the idea. - What? Apparently. the Subway Tush is not his idea. It belongs to what I 've ascertained is an ex-lover of Swedish extraction. You stole this from Bjorn? - What about edible bike shorts? - Jack. Come on. 10 miles into the ride. you get hungry. there 's a snack right there on your leg! - All right. How we doing. honey? - I 'm good. My pantyhose have a smiley face on ' em. but I 'm ready to go. Terrif. Now listen. She 's gon na come in here and act all superior. - but do n't you let her intimidate you. - I wo n't. Good girl. Now. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember... if you start thinking Helena is something special. just picture that albino rat of hers licking mol? sauce off her mug. Got it? Got it. Thank you. I 'm ready. - Medusa! - Medea. Well... hello. again. I must say I 'm surprised to see you here. Well. I 'm up for the job as well. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. Well. may the best designer win. - Ha! Not if I have anything to say about it. You 're a strange girl. are n't you? Why do the British always insult you and then ask you to agree with them? Maybe because we think that you Americans are just a little bit silly. do n't you think? - Helena! Hello. - Robert. How are you? I 'm so sorry to keep you waiting. I guess I was just saving the best for last. Oh. Robert. stop. - So what have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I been up to? Beijing. Bora Bora. Budapest - - oh. by the way. Curtis and Denise send their love. They thought the Steuben menorah was fabulous! And I must say I agree. Oh, Helena, you always say the right thing. And you must be Grace Adler? Did you have any trouble finding the place? She eats tacos! Lots of tacos! Big. honking. greasy ones with extra cheese and guac. and they drip on her fancy clothes. She thinks no one knows. but - -( laughs) Oh. they know. all right! Yeah! Miss Snooty Pants is a taco eater! So now who do you wan na hire? Well. I do n't know. Let me see your book. Book? Listen. honey. I know you 're feeling a little down about what happened. - but. hey. look on the bright side. - What bright side? Well. It 's just an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fool of myself. I forgot my book. I blew a job. My God. this is the best freaking taco I 've ever had. Grace. darling. that was a delicious performance you gave today. So delicious in fact. that I 've decided to pick up your tab. Thanks. especially since it was like $2.50 for the both of us. - Anastasia. - Endora. Hey. mon fr? re. if your derri? re... Could use a little cush - No need to pout - The word is out It 's Jack 's Subway Tush! I really mean it It 's Jack 's Subway Tush! I 'll tell ya. Daddy It 's Jack 's Subway Tush! Get out. - For real? -( laughs) Yeah. get out.( @theme_music_playing)
