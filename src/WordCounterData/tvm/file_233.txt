5265041 Why can I just stay here? We 're all gon na live together as a big happy family. I do n't want to go. Kristina, unfortunately, one of the nodes that we removed has cancer. - I 'm sorry... treatment. - Will it go away? Do you say that 's she 's gon na need chemotherapy? - Hey. You remember me? - Hi. - My grandpa 's friend. - Right. Would you go out with me sometime? Yeah. I met a guy this summer. What, are you, like, breaking up with me or something? I still want to be friends. Look, for the record, I really think this is an awful idea. Yes, I know you think this is a bad idea. I 'm serious. It 's terrible. I mean, what are you even thinking? You know, she 's sick. It 's just a nice, like, get-well basket. - You 're her ex-boyfriend. - I know. - Why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her ex-boyfriend. That 's the whole point. This is not the way to do it. She 's gon na think that it 's creepy and... and sad. I mean, what is this stuff even? This is her house. That one. I do n't want to talk about it. Like tea, and like, a filtering water bottle? Where did you even get this? I got it from aunt Kristina. She got a bunch of baskets and told me I could take it. Wait a second, I 'm sorry. You 're re-gifting a cancer patient 's... Yes, I know it sounds bad, but she told me to take it. Gift basket to your ex-girlfriend who does n't even want you to come over. - Oh, my gosh. - Please do n't do it. We can have lunch. Just wait here for me. Um... Go, go, go, go, go. What happened? What the hell? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Oh, my God. What is this? All right. Hey, Max. This is the third time. I 'm asking you nicely. Please take Otis for a walk. - I 'm busy, dad. - Put the video game down. Do I have to take that away from you? No, you do n't, actually. Max, when we got this dog, you promised that you would help take care of him. I am taking care of him. I 'm petting him. Giving him love and affection. You know what? Cut the crap, Max. That 's of huge importance right now. Get outside and take the dog out for a walk now. Good morning. - Hi. - What 's going on? Good morning. Nothing, nothing. Everything 's great, honey. Everything 's just fine. - Honey. - We got it all under control. - Max. - All under control. If your dad asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out. Max, Otis! - You wanted this dog... - What? - Oh, geez. - He 's peeing on the floor. - I can not watch this right now. - Outside, outside, outside. - Honey. - Oh, look at that. And he 's all done peeing. Max, you got ta listen, okay? We could just get him a litter box or something. No, no, no, no, no, no. Honey, just... I got everything, okay? You 're doing too much. It 's not a big deal. I 've got this taken care of. You 're overdoing it. The eggs are burning. Look out. I ca n't eat those now. They 're too burnt. Adam, you do n't need to do all of this. Listen, honey, I got it under control. - Okay. - Dad, I also asked for sunny-side up. Eat. Listen, I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow. Okay? No. Actually, you know what?

She said she may be able to be here. Yes. Honey, she 's got a lot on her plate. Until then, my mother will be here. It 's not necessary. I can handle this. Honey, you just had surgery. You 're gon na have chemotherapy. You need help. I do n't need help. You 're not supposed to lift anything. You 're not even supposed to lift Nora right now. - You ca n't drive. Okay? - Mmhmm. Like it or not, you 're gon na need some backup, okay? Look what I got for you here. - What is that? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrots and calcium. Powder protein, powder everything. The doctor said to put some agave syrup in there so that it 's nice and sweet. Whey protein 's one of the most disgusting things I 've ever had. Like I said, we 're in this together.

If you 're gon na cancel breakfast, you have to give me facts. You robbed me of my breakfast time. I 've been kind of, like, seeing him. - Really? - Yes, it 's different. I really like this guy. - Really? - Yes, a lot, okay? - So please. - Who is it? I ca n't talk about this now. He 's inside. Talk about it. You give me some facts. Or I 'm gon na come in. Stop! Okay. You met him. - I did? Who? - Yes, so be quiet. That 's enough. Is n't that enough? - Who? - At a baseball game. - The army guy? - Shh! - Grandpa 's friend? - Do n't call him the army guy. - Well, what 's his name? - His name is Ryan. - Hey, grandpa likes him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen, you have to go. - No, I 'm excited. - Please, just... - Introduce me. - No. - Please get out here. - Good-bye. I love you. Bye, Ryan! Mom! - Uh... - That 's my mom. You stole my shirt so I... Hey, Crosby. Crosby! Hey! Hey. - Hey. - What the hell 's going on? I 'm gone for a couple of days. The place is a disaster area. Good morning to you too. What, is this a joke? What happened? The Dave ray trio happened. Those jazz nerds, they know how to party, man. They turned into gremlins last night. - Where 's Amber? - Amber texted me. She overslept. I told her just to show up at lunch. And it 's gon na be fine. Oh, it 's fine for her to come in late in the day and then just gon na sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is unacceptable! You ca n't let her skate by ' cause she 's a family member. - Okay. I 'm sorry. - You know what? - I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry. - I want you to come down here. - You 're right. - And I want you to help me clean this. Look at that. That 's real nice, is n't it? Tell you what. You clean it up. - I will clean it up. - Okay, all right? I will. Leave it. I 'll get that too. Camille, you do n't have to do all of that. You can leave it. Oh, that 's okay. I do n't mind. I mean, I 'm here to help. I know, but it 's actually Max 's job. Oh. Hewe 're on a whole sticker system so it sort of gives him incentive to do... - Of course. - You know. - Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything? How about a big jug of wine? Should hit the spot right about now. - Yeah, you wish. - I know. It 's just sort of ironic I ca n't have any alcohol considering I 'm about to pump poison into my body in the next couple of days. You know, I have a friend who recently went through chemo. Oh, yeah? How are they doing? - She 's doing great. - Really? - 18 months now, cancer-free. - That 's great. So but anyway, she said that it 's best not to think of it as poison but more like a platoon of soldiers that have entered your blood stream to... Fight the enemy... - Disease. I 've read all the pamphlets. I hate this. The whole reason I got him involved in baseball was so he could make some friends. - I know. - How could they not invite him? He 's new. Kids have groups, cliques. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon. You do n't think it 's because he 's... - He 's what? - Be-because... - because he 's Latino? - Yes, because... I do n't know, because kids are weird. And maybe... I just wish one of their parents would have thought to invite him. - What? - Nothing. Hey, bud. Your mom and I were just talking that you know, you have n't had anybody over to the house yet. You think maybe you might want to, you know, have a buddy over for a playdate or... Playdate? Is n't that for, like, for little kids? - Oh, yeah. No. - Oh, yeah, no. It is. So not a playdate. A hang-out. - Hang-out. - Yeah. - Would you be into that? - Sure. - Great. - Cool. - Who should we invite? - Maybe Miguel. - Okay. - I do n't know Miguel. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? No, he used to live in the apartment above mine. Oh, you... You mean in the old neighborhood. Yeah. He 's cool. Yeah, well, we 'll look into it. Great. Can we do that? Well, these are job prospects courtesy of the V.A. Here you go. Hey, you know what? You could put in an application in here. Amber used to work here. She liked it. She 'll put in a good word for you. You 're really invested in my employment situation, I see. Yeah, I mean, it 's... It 's just great to have somewhere to go in the morning or a reason to get up. Just makes you feel better about yourself. Believe me, I know. Okay, I 'll... I 'll take a look. Sprinkler technician, Berlin-miro landscape architecture. Starting salary... Wow, that 's low. Yeah, well, okay. That 's not a good one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norell family farms, irrigation consultant for mid-sized wheat farm. Wheat. Kid from Wyoming... Must know something about wheat. Yeah, I do know a little something about planting wheat, but not from Wyoming. Yeah, where? Well, one of my jobs in Afghanistan was to talk to the local farmers there. We 'd offer them seeds, fertilizer, better irrigation. Try to gain their trust, you know. Win the hearts and minds. And then, you know, we wanted them eventually to switch out their opium plants for wheat crops. Mmhmm. How 'd it work out? It did n't always work out so good. What happened? We met this one opium farmer outside of Marjah, and we worked on this guy for a while. And then finally he agreed to plant the wheat. A couple of weeks after we helped him switch out the poppy plants, he was killed. Uh, I guess they were sending a message to the rest of the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy, Zeek. We did n't drop any bombs or pull any trigger, but we killed that guy. I do n't know where it is. Try again up here. Can I get something for you? I was just looking for the chamomile tea. - It 's up here. - Oh. - It probably... - I moved it. I 'm sorry. You know, I figured with your stitches, you know, you would n't be able to reach. Thank you very much, Camille. - That 's great. - Sure. And I 'll get the water. Thank you. Okay. Is that sugar? I do n't have stevia here. I do n't usually use it. Well, it 's actually good for you. Stevia, it 's a nutrient. It 's only one scoop. Okay. - Is that your door? - You 're right. That 's my door. - I 'll get it. - Okay-no, no, no. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh, hi. - Hi, we 're the lessings, Adam and Kristina 's friend 's. Of course you are. I remember you. She knows who we are. Camille, where is she? Where 's our girl? Stop it, Phil. He does this. He 's excited because she 's like family to us. It 's okay. Come in. Kris? Oh. Hey. - Hi. - Thanks for that, Camille. - Sure. - Sorry to barge in like this. We wanted to see how you were doing. I 'm good. I 'm home. Oh, and you brought a chicken. We 're here for you, Kristina. Thank you very much. This is... this is beautiful. Thank you. Let 's see where I 'm gon na put... - Okay. - Oh, you got a few. Thank you. Yeah. A lot of chicken. - It 's good. - Thank you. Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good? - Yeah. I 'm glad to see you 're back together. Oh, yeah, well, we 're in counseling, you know. - Sex therapy. - Ca n't have that... - That 's very important. - It is. So you know what, I actually... It 's her naptime, and I wish I could stay and visit longer. And thank you for... Oh, I 'll do that, kris. - I 'm gon na take her up. - No, I 've got her. - Camille, I got it. - Visit with your friends. - Thank you. - No, really, of course. Okay. You stay, visit with your friends. - Thank you. - Say " bye-bye. " - Bye. - Bye, honey. How are you holding up? I 'm good. I 'm good. I mean, this as a surprise... I 'm sorry. Oh, Suze. It 's okay. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do this. - Aww, it 's okay. - I 'm sorry. Oh! I 'm a... A little sore. - Oh, my God. - It 's okay. - Oh, my... I 'm sorry. - It 's okay. - Just a-a gentle, gentle hug. - Okay. Be careful. Do n't touch her. Can I get you a tea or something? You guys want anything to eat? - It 's just not right. - I would love a tea, actually. Want some chicken? Why do n't you have a seat? Okay? Do you have English breakfast? I just spoke to the social worker. And? And she does n't think it 's a good idea. She thinks we should keep working on establishing him here. Not open up old wounds. Which is what we expected, so no Miguel. - No. - What? I think we should do it anyway. I think that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a bad idea. She did n't say we could n't do it. Are you " lawyering " me? Is that what this is? I 'm Victor 's mom-ing you. And I think that my opinion should weigh as much as hers. We should be helping Victor establish new friendships. That 's what we should be doing right now. I know, but he needs a friend right now. He just needs a friend. He 's gon na make friends. He just... Babe, he was really pretty heartbroken. You should have seen it when they left him out. I 'm telling you he needs this. Okay. Okay. Good to see you. Okay, Brian. Take care. - Yeah. - Dad. Sarah. Good heavens. - Hi, how are you? - So Sarah Braverman. - Give me a kiss. - Mwah. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing here? Well, I wanted to see where you work, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things now that we moved in together. Hey, wait a minute. - Coffeemaker and stuff. - Thank you, honey. Sammy, Sammy, Sammy. I want you to meet somebody. This is my daughter, Sarah Braverman. Hi, nice to meet you. Sammy was a pilot. He got shot down. Sarah, hi. Well, we hear a ton about you around here. Young fiance and the kids. That-yeah. - She 's pretty though, huh? - Oh, yes. - Hey, Zach. - Nice to meet you. Zach. I want you to meet somebody. Zach 's a world war ii vet. Well, hi, there, honey. - Hi, there. - Okay, that 's good. He 's a ladies man. And then... Henry! Henry, look. - This is my daughter, Sarah. - Hi. Your dad does n't know crap about the game of baseball. - But he 's cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry. That was really nice. - Yeah. - You 're like the mayor. - Yeah. - That 's so cool. Hey, is Ryan here? - No. Why? - Oh. Hmm. Well, he 's, you know, Amber 's new flame. Thought I 'd check him out. Amber 's new flame? Yeah, he and Amber started dating after... I guess they hit it off at the baseball field. He did n't tell you? They 've been seeing... No, we just had lunch together, Ryan... He did n't say anything, and we talked about Amber. He did n't tell me. Well, you 're an intimidating guy. You like him though, right, dad? It 's, uh... Yeah, um... let me show you my office, honey. Come here. Well, how exactly is she driving you crazy? She 's a hovercraft. She 's in the kitchen. She 's moving everything around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh, by way, the lessings stopped by today, and they brought a chicken. Another chicken. They stayed for 2 1/2 hours. She took Nora upstairs while I had to sit downstairs and entertain them. I had to make Phil Lessing tea. It 's just so frustrating. I do n't know what to do. I feel like a prisoner in my own home. Oh, sorry. Listen, I 'll... I 'll talk to her. I just... I do n't want you to do that, okay? I mean, look. She 's fine, she 's helpful. She 's trying to be there for me. I just... It 's frustrating to me, honey, because I do n't like being taken care of. Okay? I 'm not used to it. I want to take care of people. And I feel just... I just... I feel helpless right now. - You know? - Oh, honey. Just I wish... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be able to pick up my baby. I want to be able to take her upstairs and read her a book at nap time. I want to be able to not eat this crappy food that 's making me feel yucky and supposed to be healthy for me, okay? And I want my mom. I want my own mom to consider me important enough to get on a plane and come here to see me. And I know I sound like I 'm complaining right now, but I just sometimes wish that things were back to normal. And I wish that I could just crawl up in a ball and cry over it, but I ca n't because... Because your mother 's here. I 'm really sorry. - I 'm sor... - Krissy? Um, I got ta go. I 'm fine. I 'm just having a moment. I love you. All right, love you too. Bye. - Hey. - Hey. You are alive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so I just assumed - you were sick and... - Yeah, I 'm fine. I 'm actually going in today, so... Oh, yeah? Thank you for the basket, by the way. - Oh, yeah. - That was really sweet. I just kind of left it. - But I 'm glad you got it. - Yeah. You know, I should finish getting ready. Yeah, I just wanted to say hey, and... Who 's there, Ames? - It 's just my friend, Drew. - Oh, right. You know, I heard a lot about you. Oh. - This is Jake. - Hey. Ah, so senior year, huh? Yeah. Man, I wish I was still a senior. I mean, do n't get me wrong. I love college. But senior year is a special kind of awesome. I envy you, dude. Oh, wow. Thanks. I 'll just see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I just dropped by to take Ames to school. We can give you a ride if you want. It's-it 's fine. - I have my bike, so... - You sure? Yeah. I 'll see you there. Okay. I was thinking it 'd be a good idea if I took Syd out so, you know, Miguel and Victor could have some time alone. That sound like a good idea? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, this is it. This one. Yeah, here we go. Oh. Hey, you must be Miguel. I 'm Joel. It 's good to meet you, buddy. - There he is. - Hey. The radio 's not working again? Jiminy Christmas. Twice in two days. I think I saw less of you when you lived here. Well, I-I know how much you miss me, so... Well, I kind of miss Drew a little more. Thanks, dad. Appreciate it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amber that you wanted to tell me, was there? I feel like something was a little off. No, well, I... Yeah, he just did n't tell me he was dating my granddaughter. That kind of was screwed up. Uhoh. That 's it, though? Nothing else to worry about? Damn it. This is n't the right tool. Ouch. - What 'd I do with that? - Dad. I do n't know, Sarah. I mean, the kid just got back from Afghanistan. You know, he 's been in a war. Got a lot of stuff going on. That 's normal. I mean... I was the same way when I got back. Just gon na take some time to get some balance in his life. Well, you know when you 're going through it, it 's usually the people you love and the ones that are closest to you that get hurt the most. That 's... He 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah, I know, mom. I understand. Yeah, if Roy has a kidney stone, I mean, those can be pretty painful. So it 's probably not the best time for you to be out of town. Sure. I 'll just... I 'll let you know. All right. I love you. Is everything okay? Yeah. It 's just bad timing. You know, it turns out my mom 's not gon na be able to... To get out here right now. But she just wanted to say thank you so much for covering for her. I 'm sorry. I know how much you wanted her to come. It 's fine. I mean, it 's not a surprise. She 's been like this for as long as I can remember. You know. I mean, I... I wanted her to want to be here. You know what? I 'm actually... I 'd like to go get Max. Oh, no, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's fine. Honestly, I 've been cooped up in this house for a week. And I just... I 'm... I 'm just wanting to get out. And you think you 're okay to drive? Camille, I 'm completely fine. Okay? I 'm able to pick up my daughter, I 'm able to pick up my son from school. I can make my own tea. I know how to take care of everything. Just... can I have the keys? Of course. - Hey. - Hi. Look, I 'm really sorry about earlier. That was really awkward for all of us. Yeah, was that your camp friend? Um, well, we kind of met there. Was he like a lifeguard or something? Is n't he, like, embarrassed? He 's like a college guy dating some high school girl. I mean, he looks like 30. I do n't understand. Is n't it illegal also on top of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal. Drew, I 'm sorry. And I mean, I know that this morning was probably really hard for you. All right, whatever. Do n't give me that, all right? Enough bad stuff is happening to me. I 'm pretty much used to it at this point, so... Why? What do you mean? Nothing. My mom decided to move in with Mr. Cyr. So you know, now I live with him in this two-bedroom apartment, and we found out my aunt has cancer. - What? - Yeah, my aunt Kristina. She has cancer, so it 's serious. And the basket that I gave you was her cancer basket. So you can thank her for that one. I got ta go. Whatever. - Surprise. - You 're driving. Yup. You 're not supposed to be driving. - Dad said. - I know. - And you 're eating ice cream. - Mm-hmm. Dad says you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it's-it sandwich treat. Here 's how this is gon na go down. You did not see me eat this ice cream cone. And you did not see me driving. - Are you listening? - Yeah. What happens here stays here. Okay? - So it 's like in Vegas? - Kind of. And if dad asks, grandma picked you up. I did not pick you up. You got it? What do I get if I say that? - Hey. - Hi. So, how 'd it go? Really, really well. Yeah? Yeah. It was kind of amazing, actually. He was so happy. I mean, he was like a different kid. He was so engaged, and he was having... He was having a wonderful time. It was really something. What? But I wish that we could bring that out in him. I wish that we could make him that happy. I really thought that we were making progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not enough. There 's a whole world inside him. We 're just not getting in there. And I want to see that version of him. All the time. We will. - Hey. - Hey. What are you still doing here? Um, uh, Kristina went to sleep early, and mom and dad are watching Max and Nora. So I just wanted to catch up, you know. You know what? I have some questions here for you about these bookings and expenses right here. Can you take a look at those for me? - Adam. - What? Could you do me a favor and just stand up for a second? You need to look at these. I will look at those tomorrow, but you need to stand up right now. We need to go out to a bar and get you a cocktail. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at yourself recently? No, I have not. You 're a man who 's in desperate need of a cocktail. Let 's go, now. I 'm on a no-alcohol diet. I 'm in solidarity with Kristina right now. Okay? So I 'm not... I 'm not going out to a bar. I promise you she will never find out. And all this stuff will be waiting for you tomorrow. - You can do it then. Okay? - No. I 'll tell you what I 'm gon na do. - What? - One-time offer only. I will pay. It 's that serious. - Do I really look that bad? - Yes. I try to help out Kristina by having mom come over, and then she gets upset, and I got ta go call mom. And say, " listen, we want you to stop moving stuff around the cupboard. " Hey, my friend. Two beers. Excuse me. And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She gets all quiet.
