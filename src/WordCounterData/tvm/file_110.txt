5230341 Previously on " Without a Trace " It 's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In layman 's terms, it 's a deterioration of the heart muscle. Vivian, this can be very serious. You 're on a wire? It 's not a wire. It 's a Holter monitor for my heart. I 'd really appreciate it if you did n't say anything to anyone about this. Viv, You okay? What 's wrong? Somebody get a medic! We have a 37-year-old African-American female with a diagnosis of I-H-S-S. BP is 70 over palp. Heart rate 110, respiration 15. Presented in a-fib but she 's alert and oriented times four. It 's 1:05 A.M. and we 're approximately eight minutes out. Over - Got it, 782. - How bad 's her condition? I 'm not sure. The doctor will know more. When was she diagnosed? Uh, when were you diagnosed? A month ago. - What? - A month. A month, a month, a month. Just hang in there, okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the register. Thanks. Lucebella had a great day today. Over $350. Apparently crystals are back. Agnes, honey, are you okay? I guess that means yes. Well, then, I can head home and you can stay here and be brave and in command. Good night. Hey. Hey. So what are we looking at? Agnes Deschamps. She 's, um, 25 years old. This is her store. She sells new age products up front and she does psychic readings back here. She lives upstairs. No one 's seen her for a couple days. So who called it in? Another psychic that works with her. She 's on her way here now. She could have saved herself some time and just told us where to look. How 's Viv? Well, she 's checked out of the hospital, but, um... she 's still going to have to have that surgery. Hmm. You been to see her yet? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks good, you know, considering the circumstances. Hey, Jack... check this out. Somebody did n't like their reading. Yeah. 3x19 : SECOND SIGHT Each of the dates is an appointment, when the client came in for a reading, and their symbols relate to what they talked about. Okay, but there 's no master list? I mean, except for these phone numbers, there 's no way to figure out who any of her clients are? No. I 'm sorry. Do you, uh, do you think she was scamming people? I never felt any psychic energy from Agnes, but she was good with her clients. I mean, she had an-an instinct for discerning what they needed. Now, she may not have had the gift, but she was trying to help them. Do you think it 's possible that one of her clients, perhaps whoever sent her this, figured out that they were being conned and got pissed off? She was scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for my help but about a week ago, she came to me and said she was involved in something and could n't figure out what to do. There 's this man, and he 's angry with me, you know, about what I did. Have you talked to him about it? No, I-I sort of wanted to figure out how to handle it before I talked to him again. Okay. Think about... why he 's angry. Now imagine yourself on a road... moving away from the anger. Where 's the road going? I do n't know. I 'm afraid I do n't know either. There 's a... there 's a dark cloud around you, and I ca n't see through it. I 'm sorry. It 's not your fault. I just, um... I 'm wasting your time. Let 's try a candle. See if it gives us any guidance. What have you got to lose. Right? But I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candle back. What exactly was she supposed to do with it? Carve his initials at the bottom and then meditate on the situation while she was lighting it, and when it had burnt out, to bring it back and I 'd read it for her. Okay, and she never told you his name or anything about him? No, but, um... this morning I had a vision. A vision? A van and the energy was... frantic. I could feel Agnes ' presence. She was scared Um, does your vision come with an I.D., a location...? You know, is it past, present, future...? I do n't know, but I think it had to do with that man. Okay. I 'm not making this up, Agent Spade. But I think... We 'll be in touch. Thank you. Agnes? Yes, sir. She 's been missing for two days. You know, all that mumbo jumbo, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good neighbor. You ever see anyone hanging around, anything strange? Think about it. I mean, it could be something small. About three weeks ago, I was at the dentist in the afternoon my-my gums were sore so, I was just in the house reading the paper and, uh, I heard thumping. Agnes? Honey, you okay? I 'm going to get help. No, no, Mr. Klumke. 9-1-1. Uh, yes, we need an ambulance at 496 Hester Street in Queens. No, no no ambulance, no doctor. I 'm fine. You 're not fine, and you pay your taxes for moments just like this. Yes. My neighbor fell. They took her to St. Andrew 's. Kept her overnight. She brought me chocolates the next day. Made some joke about how clumsy she was. But now you 're not so sure she tripped? You say she 's missing. Yeah. I 'm thinking maybe what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away. Thank you, sir. And you saw her once a week? Agnes really helped me reach out to Glen. Reach out...? I missed him so much. Agnes helped me talk to him. Okay, according to her files, you were the last client she saw. Something happen between the two of you? Nothing between us. We were talking about Glen, like always, and... a man came in and ruined it. And he 's ready, Edgar. Ready for you to let go. But I do n't want to. I know. But it 's been nine months and Glen wants you to move on, to start doing the things you love to do. Remember how much you love to paint? But what will I do without him? When were you going to tell me? I am with a client right now. I ca n't talk about this. Everything was in place and you screwed it up. Agnes? It 's okay. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. Well, you should 've thought about that before! Come back later, please. Now is not a good time. Agnes said the man 's arrival was a sign of how the spirits were upset because I would n't let go. Uh, do you have any idea who this man that interrupted you was? I do n't know. Since that time, I have n't been able to feel Glen 's... presence, and... you have to find Agnes. I did n't get to say goodbye to him. Hello? Hey, there. How you doing? Well, I never thought I 'd miss going through credit card reports so much. Well, then I could sure use you here, because I 'm striking out on this one. No social, no bank accounts, no records anywhere. They 're out there somewhere. They 're always out there somewhere. Right. Hey, um, I was wondering if you need a second opinion, uh, ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cardiology over at Pres St. Luke 's. No, no. The doctor I saw at the hospital agrees with Dr. Marsh, so, uh, I guess I 'm through with the diagnostic phase. Okay, okay. Well, uh, I just thought I 'd give you a call. Is there anything else you need? No, but thank you, sweetie. All right, well, take care, Viv. Okay, thanks. Bye. Bye. How is she? Uh, she sounded all right. But you know how she is. Right. We found this in a dumpster behind Lucebella. What 's all that hocus-pocus? I 'm not really sure. She used it in some kind of ritual. She was having problems with some guy. There 's some initials carved in the bottom. It 's kind of either a ' P ' or a ' B ', but there 's definitely an ' L.C. ' Here. Hmm. We have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the best place for us to start looking is at her client list. Well, Samantha 's interviewing anyone we can track down. I 'll see if I can conjure up something on L.C. Oh, hilarious. Agnes Deschamps. Here we go. She came to the ER with a hairline fracture of her radius, concussion... she stayed overnight. Did you see this guy with her? Nope. It was almost a month ago. I 've seen a lot of patients since then. Were her injuries consistent with someone that took a fall? Yeah, sure. Ah. Now I remember. Okay, the injuries she sustained that night were n't the only ones she had. Ms. Deschamps... your arm, your leg ; there are other healed bone breaks on the film. I 'm just clumsy. Is somebody doing this to you? Nobody 's doing anything to me. I can call the police. They can help you with this. Dr. Lee, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Is your arm okay? Let me take a look at this. Yeah, it 's fine. People 's bones do n't just fracture for no reason. So if it 's not someone doing this to you, then I 'll need to run more tests, figure out why this is happening. Have n't you already done a bunch of tests? That was just for the fall. Not tonight. Ms. Deschamps, I insist. I really think... Dr. Lee, please. Not tonight. Yeah, there 's definitely a tremor, so I set up an appointment with a neurologist. She did n't show. But he called me, said he checked her CT scan. Said there was enlarged caudate nuclei. And for the medically impaired? We ca n't be certain, but given her other symptoms, I think it 's Huntington 's. What 's Huntington 's? It 's a hereditary wasting disease. It destroys your ability to think and move. Is it fatal? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud was around her. If she had a terminal illness, we have to consider suicide. Suicidal thoughts create a really strong energy. I could n't have missed that. Okay. Did Agnes even know she was sick? You said she did n't go to that doctor 's appointment. Huntington 's is hereditary. If she knew someone who had it, had seen the symptoms, she might have figured it out for herself. Her grandmother. There you go. Doctor said it would only hurt for a couple days. Shows you what he knows. You know... after I fell, I had this... it was like a dream, but I was n't asleep. What did you see? A bird... on what looked like a wagon wheel. What color was the bird? White. Somehow I knew it was my grandmother. You never talk about your family. I loved my grandmother. The bird was, um, trying to get away but she could n't Her wing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing I could do. Thank you for the, uh, ice. Yeah. Sure. Her grandmother must have had it. Agnes told me but I just did n't know that 's what she was really saying. What does a white bird mean? It means sorrow. I guess she had a lot to be sorrowful about. You know, we found that candle in a dumpster. It had initials carved into the bottom of it. Um... L.C. Do you have any idea who that is? She 's a client, but it 's not a man... and I do n't think Mrs. Countryman would want to hurt her. She was doing some sort of candle ritual for me? Yes, Mrs. Countryman. Do you have any idea why? Well, she might have felt guilty about some mistakes she made in my recent readings, but I... What do you mean, mistakes? We were having some financial discussions. This week, out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 's all. I just thought we should get together. Nothing bad, I hope? No, no, no, not at all. Well, let ' em rip. You 're entering a new phase. And, uh, you should be open to... uh, I think I was wrong. About what? About your estate and, um... that man. My nephew? Yeah, you see, I thought the cards were saying that you should put him in charge, but they 're not. See, the knight still has to prove himself to the lady. But I 'm supposed to sign all the papers on Tuesday. Do n't sign anything, Luanne. Not now. I 've made a terrible mistake. I do n't know how it happened, but, um... I 'm sorry. She felt so bad. She offered to refund the cost of all my sessions. How long had Agnes been telling you to put your nephew in charge of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks. Is that your nephew? Yes, it is. Was there something between Agnes and Greg? Greg, someone saw you threaten Agnes two days before she went missing, okay? They do n't know what they 're talking about. That 's a nice car. When do you take delivery? I know you put a deposit on it. Unfortunately, it was two weeks before Agnes told your aunt not to give you power of attorney. Expensive car, eyewitness, missing psychic... It was Agnes ' idea, not mine. She came to me three weeks ago and she said she could get Luanne to put me in charge of everything. But then Agnes just changed her mind. Here 's your $10,000 back. I ca n't go through with it. But we are so close. She was all set to sign the papers. Your aunt is a good woman, Greg. Just be nice to her and she 'll probably make you trustee of the estate anyway. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. Please, Agnes, take this. And I will get you the rest, the whole fifty, all up front. Please. I 'm sorry, Greg. I 'm not going to change my mind. So I took my money and I left. What did Agnes need $50,000 for, Greg? I do n't know. You 're going to have to tell your aunt the truth. She 'll never trust me again. That 's probably good. Technically, you 're not trustworthy. I just do n't think we need to do this now, that 's all. Well, how long should we wait? Until I have another attack or right before surgery? Okay, there 's no time like the present. Look, I just think we need to discuss a few things, that 's all. I mean, do you still think your sister 's the right person to look after Reggie if something happens to both of us? She 's got three kids of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Margaret. Or Rosemary and Richard. We could ask them. Richard is a Mets fan. Maybe we could get Rosemary to leave him. I just ca n't believe this is happening. What are you doing? Hey. That scorched head came from a doll that was only distributed in three states Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. Well, that 's great, but I mean, what are you doing at Vivian 's desk? My computer froze. Tech ca n't get to it until tomorrow. Oh. Did I... did I do something wrong? Well, you have n't said two words about it since she collapsed, at least not to me. And now I walk in and you 're sitting at Vivian 's desk, using her computer. You think I 'm being disrespectful to her? No, I think you 're selfish and inconsiderate, is what I think. I 'm sorry. I, uh... I think you 're looking for another reason to push me away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really upset about... I just Uh, will you guys come with me? I need you to check something out. - Sure. - In the tech room. The Pittsburgh Field Office sent us this. It 's footage of an abduction at an Every-Mart last night. - All right, you see that van? - Mm-hmm. Keep your eyes on it. All right... Back it up to where they grab her. Stop, right there. That 's Agnes. We do n't have any footage of her inside the store, so we do n't know if she was being followed. But the plates on the van are from West Virginia. 2H7, is that all we got? Yeah, and the only light we had is coming from inside the van. I 've got West Virginia DMV running that sequence against all registered vans in the state. The police report had an eyewitness named Hilda Cahill. She 's the one who alerted security. I have her waiting for us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ID 'd him yet. I was thinking, what if she pulled a scam and that 's what the 50 grand 's about. She had to pay some people back. So this is what, them catching up to her? Well, they 're a long way from New York and this was almost thirty hours after she went missing. Maybe they had her the whole time and this is her attempt at an escape. Who is that man? I do n't know. You do n't know? You told me about a van. Here it is. So either you 're involved, or you 're a psychic, and that part I find very difficult to believe. I do n't know who this man is. Then how did you know about the van? I just... I just do. Oh! Look... you 're dealing with some very difficult things right now. A sick friend. And it 's causing you to think about a problem you 're having with M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I knew. I 'd be happy to help, but I already told those other police everything that I saw. Oh, no. We 're sure you did. We 're just trying to confirm a few things, that 's all. Okay. Well, for that poor girl, anything I can do. Why do n't you start by telling us what happened that evening Now, according to this police report, you were, uh, shopping at the Every-Mart. They were having a sale on towels two for one and I was walking in the parking lot back to my car, but I could n't find it. And it 's not because of my vision I have 20-20 it 's that, I 'm sure that in that part of the parking lot all the lights were out. It was so dark. It made me nervous. And then I heard her scream. And she was gone before I knew what had happened. Were you able to get a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No, I 'm sorry. It was just, you know, so dark. You know, if you ask me, you know, I think that this is Every-Mart 's fault. Why do you think that? Because if they had fixed those lights, this would n't have happened. All right. Now, the woman who was grabbed in the parking lot, is there any possibility that you saw her in the store before? No. I-I do n't remember her. But now that you mention it She had a shopping bag. So, the shopping bag, did you see it on the ground? I mean, it was dark, and we did n't see it on any of the security tapes. Oh. Right. Oh, I... I 'm sorry, it 's just all this talking. I must be, you know, confused. Oh, well, we do n't want you to be confused. Now, what are you, what are you confused about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag. Right. I tell you what, um... I 'll get you a cup of coffee, all right? Ah, thank you. Hey. Hey, sorry, bro. My computer 's still down. Ah, mi computer, tu computer. Ah, bueno. How 'd it go with the eyewitness? Uh... she 's a moving target. What have you found? Well, there 's not a single van in West Virginia with a 2H7 sequence on its plate. Stolen plates? No, I do n't think so. I cross-referenced every plate with that sequence with all the residences that have a van. I found one match, a house in Greenville. There 's at least a hundred registered to this address. Mm-hmm. What 's the story? Well, I 'm not sure yet, but I got a data-dump on all the people that own the cars. One thing 's for sure, not one of them is gon na get a key to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, extortion, extortion, extortion. Mm-hmm. All right, one of them is on the major crimes watch list. Who 's that? Mark Conway. Yeah, I got him right here. What 'd you do, Mark Conway? Well, other than, uh, extortion and embezzlement, he 's suspected of being part of a clan of travelers a gypsy family group. You know, maybe all the people at that house are part of the clan. - The eyewitness. Hilda Cahill. - Right. The whole time that Jack and I were talking to her, it was as if she was trying to guess what we wanted her to say. She have a car on that list? Nope. Well, check out Carla Callahan. Aka Heather Callahan, aka Heather Cahill. Aka Hilda Cahill. She 's one of them. Mm-hmm. Hilda, I 'm sorry, Heather. Wait, Carla. Okay, I 'm confused Uh... why do n't you tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what you 're talking about. You know what else you do n't know? Who you 're talking to. I 'm FBI. If I want to, I can make your life a living hell. Do you understand that? Do you understand that, Hilda? Tell me what I want to know. His name is Patrick Orton, or Patrick O'Connell, or Patrick something else. The list goes on and on. You know, ' P ' is one of the initials on that candle. Mm-hmm. And he 's got a 2002 Dodge Ram, registered to the house in Greenville. That 's where the, uh, 2H7 license plate on the van came from. The cops checked out the house, but nobody was there. Now, this group or clan, they, uh, move east and west along I-64, running scams in towns along the way. For example, they blow out a light in the parking lot, stage an abduction, then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all gets settled out of court. Do we know how Agnes got involved? Well, Danny 's interviewing Ms. Cahill right now. Hopefully, she can tell us. You 're smart. You 're trying to figure out all the angles, but sometimes smart people complicate things. This is simple. All I want to know is what Agnes is doing with you guys that 's it. You tell me that, and you 're done. That 's it? That 's it. She 's my niece. Her real name is Margaret. What else? What else? She stole $50,000 of the family 's money when she ran away from home seven years ago. Okay, I 'm going to need you to write down the names and the aliases of all the people involved in that fake kidnapping. You told me we were done. I lied. Oh, and here 's the part where I have to tell you that you 're entitled to that one phone call. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a phone. Excuse me. All right, give her a phone, capture the number, but do n't let the call go through, okay? Jack, look what I got. Hilda dialed a cell phone, and it pings off a tower 150 miles west of their home base in Greenville. Whose phone? No idea. It 's registered to an alias, and the bills, they go to a post office box, so... Are we tracking it? Yep, it 's going towards Greenville. Well, maybe we can catch them along the way. This clan makes a living off selling defective RVs. What do you say we buy one? Set up a sting. Great. Think our mark just showed up. You ready? Yeah, I 'm ready. Howdy. I 'm Jack, I called you. Patrick Conway. Nice to meet you, Jack. Nice to meet you, Patrick. That 's a, uh... that 's a nice-looking RV. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? My daughter just had a baby. And now that we got a grandson, the wife did n't want to go anywhere. Well, you know what, Patrick? I think I can help her out with that. FBI. Freeze! Put your hands up, put ' em on the hood of the RV. Up against the car. Come on. Spread your legs. That looks like a lot of people I know. Look, I do n't care about your Every-Mart scam, okay? I just got to find Agnes, or Margaret or whatever you call her. Why? Because she stole $50,000 from you, and I do n't know what you would have done to get it back. You think I hurt her? She broke from the clan. She 's still my daughter. She 's your daughter? She ran away with some... kid from outside, seven years ago. That 's why she had to make it right. It 's a little over $7,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Daddy. But if I showed up with fifty, would you be any less mad? Probably not. I was 17. And Lester, he... he told me a lot of stories about what life would be like in New York. What was it like? For Lester, I bet it was great. He skipped with all the money about a week after we ran away. I wanted to call you, but I could n't. I knew how mad you 'd be. I kept thinking about how much I let you down. I 've missed you so much. I thought about you all the time. I even ate a piece of red velvet cake on your birthday every year. Since your grandmother died, nobody makes it anymore. That 's all the money I 've saved. But I want to come home, Daddy. Please? Daddy, I just, I need to come home. If it were up to me... but there 's the clan. Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you made her fake an abduction. I think flowers would have been a nicer homecoming. You 're not one of us. You would n't understand. She has Huntington 's. You know that, right? Listen to me. Like I told you, I do n't care about your scam here. As far as I 'm concerned, I do n't know anything. I just want to see your daughter, to make sure she 's okay. I 'll bring her to you. You know, I have a feeling she 's nearby. Why do n't you just, um, why do n't you just call, have her brought here? Come on, baby. This is, uh, Jack Malone. He 's with the FBI. We got to talk to him, okay? Hi, how you doing? Patrick, why do n't you come over here with me. Come on. Let 's take a little walk. You okay? I 'm fine. Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money. I 'll make good on it. Your father knows you 're sick. You told him? Mm-hmm. You need to see a doctor. Have you ever seen anyone die of Huntington 's? No. Their arms and legs, they jerk around like they 're trapped and trying to get away. No talking. No laughing. And it takes a really long time. When I fell down the stairs, I knew it. I could n't do this on my own. My family will stay with me. Who else would do that? No one. You take care. It 's gon na be okay, baby. It 's going to be all right. It 's okay. Let 's go. Hi. Agent Spade. I just wanted to make sure that you heard about Agnes. Yeah. A gypsy. Huh. Who knew? You could have just called me. Yeah. The thing is, I was, um... well, I was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, uh... I should probably go. Would you like a reading? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Okay. How 's Reggie? He 's a pain in the ass. Why is that? I think he 's, you know, a bit sick of myself and Marcus being around the whole time. Yeah, like most teenagers are like that. Look, I 'm sorry I left you shorthanded. Hey, it 's not a problem. We got it covered. Really? Mm-hmm. You look like you could use some sleep. Well, nobody minds putting in a few extra hours till you get back on your feet. I collapsed, so we did n't have a chance to talk about what 's going on with this. No. I understand if you need to fill the chair. It 's not necessary. I 'm just saying it 's okay. I know.
