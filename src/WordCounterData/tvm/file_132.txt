We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea there were so many bad Japanese monster movies. Come on. What do you mean " bad "? These are immortal works of art, man. About giant vegetables? Oh, yeah? I 'd like to see you take on Radzilla the Killer Radish. If you 'd practice more and watch TV less, you could take on anything. Uh, guys. From the looks of things, I 'd say it was a bunch of, uh, nerds. Something tells me you boys do n't work for the city, am I right? [ALL_SCREAM] You would n't hit a guy with glasses. No, but then, those are n't glasses. They 're magnifying lenses. [PUNCH_LANDS] That 'll shut you down. And this 'll really steam you. NERD 1 : Ah, let 's get out of here! Woah, slick trick, dude. I knew these pipes had water running through them. But steam? Oh, sure. The city delivers millions of cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always knew this show was educational. Dudes, check it out. " Opening tomorrow, the most exciting amusement park in the world : Combat Land. " " Test your skills against the greatest robot warriors in history and beyond. " Whoa. I 'd sure like to check that out. As much as you guys duck practice, I ca n't see why you 'd want to test your skills against those robots. Hey, we pull our fair share, Leonardo. Maybe more than you think. MAN : There are three main zones here at Combat Land : The Shogun Zone, where you can test your martial arts mastery against samurais and ninjas, the Medieval Zone, where you can pit your metal against valiant knights and the Future Zone, where we are now, where it 's your job to clean up the streets of these cyber warriors. It all sounds awfully dangerous. Not at all. These robots would blow a circuit before they 'd harm anyone. The samurai and knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasters shoot harmless beams of light. Yes, but, uh, do n't you have any, uh, you know, nice rides? Ah, for non-combatants. We have this boat ride, which travels between the various zones. This story will generate a lot of publicity for tomorrow 's grand opening. Actually, the park may not open tomorrow. The robots have n't been fully tested yet. Why not? I have n't found anyone with the combat skills to give them a thorough workout. April, if the park does n't open tomorrow, there goes your story. Um, Mr. Stressbar, I think I know some guys who could give your robots a super workout. Yes? MICHELANGELO : All right, now for some serious sci-fi and scarfing. You guys should be practicing. Hey, did n't we just get through kicking nerds out of the sewers? But have n't you noticed we 've been doing a lot of that lately? You know, he 's right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with the sewers this month. Yeah. That 's probably coincidence. Yeah. What jerkazoid in his right mind would wan na to sabotage the sewers? [TURTLECOM_BEEPS] APRIL : Guys, it 's April. The new Combat Land amusement park is opening. How would you like to be the first guests? Would we? Whoa, we 're there. [SIGHS] You do n't wan na practice, but you do wan na go fight robots. Fine. This is n't practice, Leonardo, this is fun. APRIL : This is Horatio Stressbar, the developer of Combat Land. And this is Denton Nulcet, our chief robotics engineer. Hello. Oh, dear, forgive me. I 'm afraid you 're going to have to give us those weapons. Our ninja code wo n't let us surrender our weapons. Tsk, tsk. That 's a pity, because our safety code does n't permit real weapons in Combat Land. Whoa, looks like we got no choice, dudes. Great. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special harmless weapons for fighting the robots. April, I do n't like this. The turtles should not be giving up their weapons. Irma, you 're just being a worrywart. I 'm telling you, there 's a real story going on here. I 'm going to get the other minicam and find it. I 'm going to the Shogun Zone for some good old-fashioned ninja action. Who 's with me? Sorry, dude. I wan na nail some knights in the Medieval Zone. And Raphael and I wan na check out the Future Zone. But do n't you wan na get in touch with our ninja heritage? Oh, please. Why dwell in the past when you can explore the future? Fine. I do n't need your help anyway. In fact, I 'll do better without you. [PUNCHES_LAND] Dishonorable dog. You dare challenge our shogun? I 'd like to see the other guys beat that score.??? [GRUNTS] Ah, these robots are wimps. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects. But you will never defeat the shogun. Boy, this guy 's good. Yeah! Oh, no, they 've got us cornered. How 's this for some fancy shooting, huh? [BEEPING] The humans are defeating us. The cyber leader will destroy them. So the last two humans left alive. [SCOFFS] We ai n't human, bub. He 's programmed to say that. Soon there will be no humans, only we cyber warriors. NULCET : Oh, my, these turtles are good. But my robots are better. [CLEARS_THROAT] Golden mongoose. I knew there was something strange going on here. Golden mongoose. I said, golden mongoose. Have you completely lost your mind? STRESSBAR : These reporters are taking their job too seriously. They must be dealt with. Now, this is just my speed. A nice, non-violent ride. Hey! [VERNON_SCREAMS] How about you, and all that Middle Ages-type stuff? Whoa, these dudes are pushovers. BLACK KNIGHT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's domain? I do, you varlet dude. [WHINNIES] Hey, you 're not supposed to have real weapons. [GRUNTS] Where did you dudes come from? Hey, what 's going on here? Suddenly, this amusement park is n't so amusing.??? Oh, man, this is the weirdest theme park attraction I 've ever seen. COMPUTER : Analysis of subject complete. Thank you. Commence robotic duplication. You may release him. Well, this turtle is taken on. [GUN_COCKS] Going somewhere? Terrific. The Revenge of the Nerds Part 9. Boy, those robots can really fight. I 'll say. It was like me and Raphael were in the middle of a science-fiction movie. Hey, have you guys seen Irma or Vernon? No. And where 's Michelangelo? Maybe he 's still in the Medieval Zone.??? DONATELLO : Gee, there 's no sign of him anywhere. He 's got ta be around here somewhere. Oh, that goofball probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irma are missing too. Now I 'm starting to get worried. Relax, Leonardo, it 's a big park. They could be anywhere. Hey, wait up! Will you knock it off? Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys. Irma, where have you been? We thought something happened to you. I was doing some investigating on my own, okay? I saw something really weird a little while ago. What was it? I saw some guy approach a door behind this castle. And when he said -- Whoa! APRIL : Irma! Something is very wrong here. So how are we gon na stop them? We only have these stupid fake weapons. Guys! Behind you! [TURTLES_SCREAM] Oh, what in the world 's going to become of me? Vernon. They got you too, huh? I 'm going to be trapped here for the rest of my life. I just know it. Yeah, well, as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary. [CLEARS_THROAT] Uh, so, Vernon, uh, you seem to be cracking under the strain of captivity. Is this correct? What utter nonsense. I could tear down that door with my bare hands. But it 's... too much bother. STRESSBAR : Cut out that talk. I 've got my eye on you. Ah! Yes, sir! I 'm beginning to get the feeling this whole thing was a trap. Well, how are we gon na stop these mechanized maniacs? LEONARDO : We 'll just have to improvise. Come on, Donatello. As Michelangelo would say, uh, if he were here, cowabunga!??? How about you? Gesundheit. WHOOPS, [GRUNTS] [BODY_THUDS] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOTS] I hate to say it, but these robots do n't have many weak spots. Yeah, I 'm barely putting a dent in them. We better run for it, guys. That ought to hold those guys off. Yeah, but what about them? Gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. LEONARDO : Yeah, they seem to be interested in something in the city. RAPHAEL : Oh, perfect! Excuse me, does anyone have the slightest idea of what 's going on? Uh-huh. But whatever it is, it 's big. The first of the duplicate turtles is complete. I 'll throw the original in with the other prisoners. STRESSBAR : Excellent. He 's a perfect duplicate in every detail. And now I can use him to trap the rest of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and keep them out of the sewers forever. LEONARDO : Donatello, you try to stop the robots. I 'm gon na find Michelangelo and the others. If they really have captured Michelangelo, they 're probably keeping him in the infrastructure under the park. I 'm on my way. I do n't see a lock. Ha, not even a door handle. [TURTLECOM_BEEPS] Michelangelo, come in. Donatello, do you read me? [WHITE_NOISE_BLARES] Oh, something must be jamming our frequency. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost him. The shogun. [HORSE_WHINNIES] [TIRES_SQUEAL] [GRUNTS] All the ninja skill in the world is n't gon na stop those robots. [SIGHS] What I really need is -- Is the other fellas. Michelangelo! Oh, buddy, am I glad to see you. Uh, Michelangelo? [GRUNTS] Michelangelo! What are you doing? RAPHAEL : We better follow them on foot. April, go see what you can dig up on Horatio Stressbar. He 's got ta be the mastermind behind this. Okay, I 'll check the newsroom files. [ENGINE_STARTS] [TIRES_SQUEAL] Hey, what 's with these black boxes they have on their chests? DONATELLO : I 'm not sure, but they look frighteningly like timer devices. RAPHAEL : Whoa! [SPUTTERS] Jeez, these guys are built like tanks. Hey, it stopped. Great. Now all we need is another hundred or so trash barrels and we can stop the rest of them. Let 's see if he 'll start again if I remove it. I 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are walking time bombs. Look! They 're heading into the sewers.?????? DONATELLO : Those robots are walking time bombs. Yeah, and they 're gon na blow up the sewers. We 've got ta get to the lair. Come on. [SIGHS] The second turtle has been duplicated. And the explosive robots are heading into the sewers. And when they 've blown the sewers to pieces, the city will have to give me the contract to repair them. Twenty million in cash. Up front! You ca n't sell your services unless you create a demand for them. NULCET : And with the turtles out of the way, the sewers will be just the beginning. I can use my robots to sabotage bridges, knock down buildings, wreck the subways. We 'll have every major contract in the city. We 'll make billions! [BOTH_LAUGH] Okay, I got our spare weapons. [TURTLECOM_BEEPS] APRIL : Guys, I 've got something. Lay it on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract to reconstruct the sewers three times in the past month. Yeah, so, what 's so strange about that? The sewers are in perfect condition. They do n't need reconstruction. They will when those bombs go off. Then Stressbar must have been behind all those sabotage attempts we thwarted. He 's trying to get a fat QC construction contract by blowing up the sewers. I would call that a slightly unethical business practice, would n't you? Oh, man, those robots are everywhere. How are we gon na stop them? Like this. RAPHAEL : They 're all leaving the sewers. How 'd you do that? Oh, simple. Remember how that one robot stopped when I put a trash can on its head? Yeah, I just saw it the flashback. Well, that tipped me off that the robots were being controlled by radio waves from the park. The metal in the can interfered with the transmission. So I set up my own radio gear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered them to return to Combat Land. Well, that 's swell, Donatello, but our friends are there. We got ta get them out. Yeah, and we 've got ta shut down the park 's master control. When those robots get near it, its signal will override my controller. Okay, okay, fine. We can chat about it later. Let 's go. VERNON : Some superheroes. You ca n't even get us out of a locked room. Would you cork it? We 're doing the best we can. I have yet to see a door in this place that has a simple handle. Oh, that 's because they 're all voice-activated. What? What? Sure. I got it right here on tape. [CLEARS_THROAT] Golden mongoose. IRMA : But you may as well forget it. Because I think the doors are programmed to respond only to the people that work here. But Irma, you 've got one of the voices on tape. Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dudette. And this time, pump up the volume. [NERD_CLEARS_THROAT] NERD : Golden mongoose. Merciful heavens! We 're free! Where the blazes can those other two turtles be? There.??? DONATELLO : Come on. They 've got ta be around here somewhere Leonardo! Michelangelo! You 're free! Have you seen Irma and Vernon? Uh, cat got your tongue? [BOTH_GRUNT] [METALLIC_SOUNDS] [GASPS] They 're robots! [GRUNTING] Oh, he looks too much like Michelangelo. I ca n't do it. Well, I can, amigo. Cowabunga! LEONARDO : Hang on, Donatello. Boy, this is weird. Leonardo, catch! Something 's happened with the explosive robots. We lost contact with them. You 've got to re-establish contact. Boost the transmitter power. [KNOCK_AT_DOOR] The turtle robots? What are they doing here? Why have n't they captured the other two turtles like they were supposed to? We could be experiencing a total robotic malfunction. You 'd better let them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to be anything externally wrong with them. Surprise, cheese head! [ALL_SCREAM] You lousy turtles! You 're not gon na mess up my plans again! I ca n't tell which one of these gizmos controls the robots. Well, guess I 'll have to use the process of elimination DONATELLO : Come on, we 're almost in the clear. Yeah, as long as we do n't run into any... robots? IRMA : They got us cornered. Guys, this may be it. We 're doomed! This had better be it. [MECHANICS_WINDING_DOWN] Oh! Leonardo and Michelangelo did it. The robots are shut down. Yeah, but they 're not. This park is about to have the biggest fireworks show in history. [TURTLE_VAN_ENGINE_STARTS] [TIRES_SQUEAL]??? [EXPLOSIONS] LEONARDO : I owe you all a major apology. You do n't need to practice more. Your skills are awesome just the way they are. No, no, dude. You were right. Yeah, we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 'd honed our fighting skills more, we might have avoided a lot of trouble today. Yeah. So, what do you say? Let 's head to the old practice room and have a real workout. Are you nuts? After all we 've been through today, I wan na relax and check out these Ratzilla movies. Well, then, so, what 'll it be, dudes? Practice or goofing off? I-- I think goofing off -- Goofing off. Yeah, me too, pretty much.??????
