Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy? or climbing up the Eiffel Tower? Discovering something that does n't exist Hey!? Or giving a monkey a shower? Surfing tidal waves? Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein 's brain It 's over here!? Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent? Or driving our sister insane Phineas!?

Then one day, he saw it. What in the Sam Hill? It was the elusive chompy-cobra! The what? Based on his extensive history of malapropisms, I would say that he is talking about the Chupacabra, the Latin American goat-sucker that is said to haunt the deserts of Mexico and Southwestern America. That 's just a myth, like the Lake Nose Monster and Klimpaloon, the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas. Um, have you not proven those things to be true? So we have! Ferb, I know what we 're gon na do today! We 're gon na search for an elusive creature that tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( @microphone_feedback) CARL : Uh, is this thing on?

I just do n't get it. Anyway, that is about to change. Behold, the Switch-Place-inator!( STAMMERING) Why do you look so unimpressed? I simply fly over town in my biplane and I look for someone with a receding hairline standing next to someone with a full head of hair. I fire, and presto! The hairdos switch places! The person who was formerly hairline-challenged is thrilled, and the other guy is... Well, he 's gon na spend a lot of money to get his hair back. Thus, " Get Back Hair. " CHORUS :? Get Back Hair Here, I 'll show you how it works. Okay, Perry the Platypus, how 'd you like to trade places with a hungry man-eating shark?

Oh, there you are, Perry. but for a while there, we had a real-live Chupacabra. Here, we took pictures. Next. Next. Next. Next.

Just be alone ALL : Happy birthday, Isabella! Perry the Platypus! It 's no use trying to break through my protective bubble. It 's platypoof-proof! I mean... You know what I mean. Anyway, you 're probably wondering what I am doing driving this evil bug bus around town. I just got to thinking about all the things that bug me, like portable outhouses, high voltage signs. " Danger. High voltage. " I 'll decide how much voltage I can take! That 's why I created the Bugs-Me-inator! It turns whatever bugs me into bugs.( BUZZING) And since I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bubble. Huh? Oh, that 's on the out...( SCREAMING) Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off! Wait!

Get off!( SCREAMING)( EXCLAIMING) Boy, I got ta really rethink the design on this thing. By the way, you know we 're on a runaway bus careening at high speed with no one at the wheel, right?( SCARYMOVIEMUSICPLAYING) STACY : Do n't go in there! Do n't go in there! Do n't go in there! Do n't go in there! Oh! He went in there. Oh, gross, she brought thousands of tiny bugs into the house! What could be worse than that? Big bug!( SCREAMING) O-M-G! Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wearing a hat? Look out! Really? Really? Why does everyone just stampede to that conclusion? Other people wear lab coats, you know. Why do n't you say, " Oh, look, a rocket scientist " or " a veterinarian "? Are you a veterinarian? No, but that 's not the point! Check it out. We made your favorite, a red velvet cake. With a little surprise. Phew! I hope they do not have a male dancer popping out of it. They asked. But they could n't afford me. Will you do the honors, Ferb?( BEEPS) Make a wish! I wish for time alone with Phineas.( INHALES)( BLOWS)( WHISTLING) What are you doing? so I can call my mom to come bust the boys. That 's not dangerous? Dude, this is nothing. It 'll get worse. So, did you get what you wished for? Uh... Yeah. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in litter. Let 's go, you two. Next event! You 're gon na love this! Is this where you go every day, Perry? Uh, yeah, pretty much. I create inators and he breaks in and thwarts my scheme, and... It 's kind of our thing.( GRUNTS)( GRUNTING) Ooh! The Grievance. I saw this at the theaters. I still have nightmares about that greasy little girl who comes up out of the basement. No! Do n't tell me how it ends! And now, what 's a birthday party without a pinata the size of your house? Ferb? Hit it! Whoo-hoo! I 'm gon na bash this thing! Yeah! Give up the candy, yo! This is n't dangerous enough? Isabella, this must be your best birthday ever! Yeah. Sure. It 's super cool. But I did n't need... Okay, birthday girl. Gather around, everyone, and keep your eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!( RUMBLING) Um, this might be the time to call. Yep!( DIALING) Mom?

Mom, you got ta see what the boys are doing in Isabella 's yard! Isabella 's yard? That 's a new one. All right, look, you 're getting oil all over the place. Someone 's gon na have to...( SCREAMING)( GROANING) No! It 's the greasy grievance girl from the basement!( GRUNTING) No! No! What have I done? Why do you have a grievance against me?( SCREAMING) Whoa. What was that all about? Do the Flynn-Fletchers know you fight evil scientists?( RICOCHETING) Back here, Mom! Butterflies? I love butterflies! Oh, thank you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but, but... Butterflies? How long did it take you guys to collect them all? Let 's go, boys. Looks like we 've got some cleaning up to do. MONOGRAM : All right, you, and you, I 'll need a containment barrier around this area here. And you, set up the mind-eraser over here by the vermilion...( @doorbell_rings) Danville Water and Power! We 're here to read your gas thingy. Perry? What is all this? A host family? Mind erasing? Balloon cover-up? I mean, is all this really necessary? Wait a minute. It says right here in your silly little pamphlet that if your host family finds out about your agent status, then everyone who 's seen you has to have their memory erased, Perry, I 'm not part of your host family. I know, I know, it 's a technicality. Look, I do n't want Candace and the boys to lose you, but I also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 10 minutes of that Grievance movie and I do n't wan na watch that whole scary mess again. So, uh, ca n't we just keep this a secret? Luckily, sir, it looks like the residents were not home.( @clears_throat) Hello? Uh, anybody there? MONOGRAM : I 'll take care of it. Oh, hello there, young teenager. Do you live here? Yes. I walked home from the mall to find this. What is happening here? Oh, you did n't see what happened. Well, uh, we 're with the city, and there was a swamp gas incident here, uh... We 'll just get it all cleaned up and get out of your hair. We 're not gon na need the mind-erasing device... I... I mean, monkey wrench.( @nervous_chuckle) It 's a monkey wrench. Yeah. We do n't need that. Happy birthday, Isabella! Thanks, guys! I still ca n't figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser light show and the fireballs, the swans should 've been released and... Phineas, I really liked the butterflies. Thank you. Well, to make it up to you, it 's kind of lame, but maybe Ferb and I could, I do n't know, take you out for some ice cream or something? Uh... I just remembered there 's something I need to do. You two go. Is that cool? Yes. Very cool. Ferb. PHINEAS : So, did you get what you wished for? Oh, yeah, I already asked that. Confetti and streamers! Hold on. Gon na get another napkin. And butterflies. You always give me butterflies. CANDACE : Ah, look at them out there. What are they up to? Ah, looks like Phineas is saying,( SLOWLY) " Where 's Perry? " Huh. Where do you think Perry goes every day, Stace?( DEFENSIVELY) How do I know? Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, do n't look at me!( GRUNTS) I do n't know why I was asking you. Whew!
