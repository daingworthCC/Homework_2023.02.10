5248141 Trying to squeeze me for more money after we already had a deal?! Well, that was beforeI saw the plans, Sam. You expect me to pretendI did n't see this? Gon na pay up? You need to get the hell out of my office right now! Okay, Sammy. I 'll be seeing you. Can I come out now? Yes, you may. Oh, my. Wow. Sam. Right? That was incredible! Well, that 's how I do business, baby. Well, I, for one, am a fan. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, I like that about you, Sam. Mmm. Do you have a hard hat for me? Oh, yeah, well, I... I want a hard hat, baby. You can inspect all you want. Oh, God... We have pancakes... Mmm.... egg scramble. Wow. Gluten-free... muffins. Wow. It 's all so... I do have a question. Mm. What am I doing here? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I enjoy making breakfast. ' Cause it seems like you either @!A)  : want intel on how miserableRoger is since you kicked him out, or B : want him to know how amazing you 're doing without him. Out of curiosity... Mm-hmm.... what would be the answer to those questions? Well, if it 's " A, " Roger 's miserable. He 's making Riggs miserable, which, is in turn, making me miserable. And if it 's " B "? If it 's " B, " you look fantastic, and I will happily tell him that. You do n't have to. I mean, if it comes up in the conversation. Is that a new dress? You look like a million bucks. Mm. Um, 200 million, yes. That is the size of the dealI am closing today. My gosh, my boss is flying in from Dubai just for the ceremony to implode the building. Six months of my life went into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Roger. If anyone asks, I never said that. Never heard it. Mm? Scooby-Doo... Good morning, sunshine! Would you like some fresh coffee? It 's French Roast and just how we like it. Okay. So here 's what I learned about you this week. You are not a morning person, which is okay. You know, most roommates... they'renot that compatible. Try cellmates. Hmm? Rog, cellmates. Which is exactly whyI 'm trying to turn this metal echo chamber into a home. Look... new pillows, kitchenware. You know what? One day, when I 'm gone... Oh, God, please let that be today.... you 'll be able to bring a woman over here. I do n't want to bring a woman over here. What do you not get? I do n't want any other human being in my space! Is that really so? Sarcastic Roger, my least favorite Roger of all. Well, if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of you and Molly. A belt... female. Toothbrush, obviously not yours. Got mouthwash, face wash, toner. It 's Molly 's stuff. I just have n't given it back to her. And-and, and-and why do you think that is so, Riggs? Because I have n't run into her yet. Wrong answer. You want to try it again? We talked about Game-Show Roger. You said you would n't doGame-Show Roger in the trailer. I lied. Look, you walked out on Molly with zero explanation. And now you 're avoiding her because you do n't know what to say. Look, Riggs, you want your roommate 's advice? No. No, I do not want your advice. I do not want the advice of a man who is sleeping on my floor because he was evicted by the most patient woman on the planet. That 's totally different. How? Because I 'm the wronged party. The wronged party never makes the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh, right. See, when Trish finally realizes this, she 's gon na welcome me back with open arms. And when might that be? I think we need another one of these... So, I 'm thinking of cooking tonight. How does pan-seared salmon sound? Sounds like my trailer 's gon na stink again. Well, excuse me for trying to provide a healthy meal. Here 's a thought. Why do n't you cook tonight? Or any night. I have an idea. I have an idea... Am I sensing trouble at home? Honestly, I did n't think you guys would survive two days. It 's a living nightmare. Yeah, it is. I 'll repeat my offer. You could stay with me, Murtaugh. I got a pretty sweet guest room situation. He 'll accept. Scorsese 's got cats. Ugh... Our DOA is Sam Higgins, the contractor of this property. This was his office. Hmm. Looks like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife divorced him six weeks ago and kicked him out. He wound up living in a metal box. I 'm sure it was just temporary. Oh, well... I think I know why Sam 's pants were at half-mast. A clue. Guy was living in a sad, grimy trailer, away from his kids, and he died with his pants down. Ooh, careful, Rog. You 're two out of three. So, uh, please take us through what happened. Sam and I met on a dating site for... 50-somethings. It 's like Tinder 's used car lot. Okay, let 's, uh... let 's focus on last night. Um, so you were, uh... hiding... under Sam 's desk. And... And this man came in the room, and Sam told me to stay put. And that 's when the yelling started. Could you, uh, see anything from down there? Just his tassels. Sam 's tassels? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Okay, I thought " tassels " was a euphemism for... Oh. I 've never heard that. Is it? It is not. It 's not. Yeah, yeah. Is it? Yes. Yeah. No. What? The Brits say it. Mick Jagger. " I used to play with me tassels. " Anyway, moving on. Yes, please. Did you hear a name? No, but he was a city inspector. He kept demanding a bribe, and Sammy refused. And then he left, and we thought it was all over. This thing happened... Oh. You know, it 's... it 's okay. We're-we're-we 're done here. You 've been through a lot. You did a great job. Thank you for coming in. You have no idea. You know, you get divorced at my age, and you think the grass is greener, there 's plenty of fish in the sea. And the next thing you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mm, that 's... Thank you. Thank you, Officer. Wow. That 's a cautionary tale. Am I right? What? No. There 's no way possibleTrish will end up like that. I 'm not worried about Trish. Hello? Uh, where are you? Riggs? Are you in my office? I am, and you 're not here. So, that upsets me, considering I have stuffI need to talk about. Riggs, leave my office. We will schedule a session. Uh, this is a real emergency. I need to talk now. This is about Murtaugh again? What is it now, a curtain dispute? Uh, for your information, he 's making me feel bad about Molly. Oh. Okay. So, you 're feeling badly about how abruptly you ended things. No, no, no, he 's making me feel bad because I have n't talked to her since. You have n't? Not once? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father killed your son 's dog "? It did n't seem like that would really benefit anyone, so I did the next best thing and said nothing. Lying is usually better for no one. Wh... Do you think Molly cares that we have n't talked in a few months? I mean, we-we 've known each other for almost 20 years. Okay, this is what we do, all right? We-we-we float in and out of one another 's lives, okay? And we 're both good with that. Okay, then I guess the next time you see her, she 'll be totally cool. Exactly. No problem. Even you do n't believe that, Riggs. I can tell by your body language. My body language? Yes. I am that good. Now, vacate the premises. Okay. Fine. Up top? No? Okay. What you looking at? I 'm trying to find Murtaugh an apartment. Unless you want him to crash with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 's never gon na happen. Come on, Bailey, we gottawork together on this. I am. Which is why I found the inspector for our DOA 's construction site. Gary Filmore. He got a record? His greatest hits... assault, a little extortion, and he 's licensed in heavy machinery. His current job site. Text me this address. All right, last chance. Sure you do n't want to have a slumber party with your mentor? Try Scorsese. Thanks a lot, Bailey. " Butler 's. " A butler? Comes in, cleans up, cooks all of our food. I love it. Hire a butler. No, no, no, no. Butler 's Greens and Groceries. Why do I know that name? I do n't know, they 're all over Texas. Hmm. Gary? Gary Filmore, is that you? How do I know you? No. But, you know, sometimes a strangeris just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cop. Yeah. So, we 're here to talk to you about why you drove a forklift through Sam Higgins after you extorted him. Now I 'm just down to two shirts. Y'all get out of here. What the...? Hey, hey! What 's up, Gary? Calm down, calm down. We just want to talk. Well, a little too late for that. Trish? What are you doing here? Uh, a little thing we like to call " Keeping America safe again. " No. No, what you 're doing is ruining my groundbreaking, Roger. Your gr-groundbreaking for what? The deal I 've been working on for six months. Butler! But... th... I knew it. Did n't I just say, " I know that name "? I do n't remember you saying that. Remember, I was over there. You know what you could do, though. What? You could apologize to your wife. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong. What do you mean you 've done nothing wrong? You 're living at my place, and you ca n't... What is going on here? It 's almost time to implode the building. No, we 're fine, Guillermo. My husband and his partner were just doing a last-minute security check, and, uh, they 're about to leave. Yes. Right. Yeah. You remember my boss. Absolutely. I hear Trish talk about you all the time. Welcome back. Thank you. Just flew in from Dubai to press the button. It 's like a bucket list thing. And this is Henry Butler. The grocery man. Hey. It 's a pleasure. The man, the myth, the legend, yes, sir. I love your cantaloupes. This man okay, here? Oh, yeah, he 's just a murderer. Come on. Alleged murderer. We 're gon na... Yeah, we 're gon na get... hey. Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult? Hey! Well... well, maybe I do have one thing or two to apologize for. So let me get this straight. Your story is that you... Roger Mayfield Murtaugh! The man flew 8,000 miles just to push the button. Your story 's that you threatened Sam, but you did n't kill him? Yeah. This is unfixable. Are you gon na find another buildingfor him to blow up, huh? Excuse me. You are unbelievable! Yes, you! You are unbelievable! Can we lower the volume? This is my place of business. I 'm sorry, am I disrupting your place of business? Okay. Trish has a point. I 've experienced your tone-deafness often. But in all fairness, Trish, interrupting your eventwas an accident. Exactly. Now, can we agree it was a successful groundbreaking? Ground was broken. All that was lost was a photo op. All? Butler pulled out of the deal. You are unbelievable. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was an accident. An accident. Yeah. But if you want to talk about the motorcycle that you ran over, unapologetically... No. No, stop. You 're embarrassing yourself. It 's what I do. Listen. How about I talk to Butler? He 's still in the building. What? He 's here? Shenanigan central? Uh... why? Our homicide vic was Butler 's contract. It 's protocol. Do n't worry, he 's in good hands. Whose hands? All right, I got one for you, lunatic. How is a Longhorn like a possum? Mm. Both play dead at home and die on the road. All right, all right, how about what do you get when you cross a groundhog and an Aggie? I 'll bite. Six more weeks of bad football. Okay, what 's happening? He 's not driving you insane? Actually, he 's being very hospitable. Mm. For a Longhorn. Riggs? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, disguised as hospitality. I mean, it 's not his fault that his defense is terrible. You see that? Now, he 's the first real guyI 've met in this city. Actually making me a tad bit homesick. He has that gift. Which is why I need to ask for my blueprints back. I got to head on back to Austin. Oh, no, no. Mr. Butler, there 's no better place than here for a flagship Butler 's. Please do n't pull out of the deal. Look, Trish, I understand your passion, and I appreciate that, darling, but you know, the juju just is n't right. My contractor was killed. Yeah, but, uh, LAPD has the killer in custody... in record time, I might add. Actually, we do n't. Gary 's alibi checks out. He 's being released now. Uh, yeah, I-it 's not just my contractor. You know, I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Who?... bidding on the property... Uh, I do n't know, something or other... Ortega? And besides, I need to be in a city where I can get a good Texas meal. You know exactly what I 'm talking about, do n't you, partner? Hey, Mr. Butler. The best Texas barbecue I 've ever had is right here in Los Angeles. Well, thank you. Shut up, not you. I do n't believe you, son. Well, stick around for a night, give Trish here another opportunity, I 'll serve it up myself, make a believer out of you. I 'll tell you what, I 'll call my wife, tell her I 'm running late. You 're on, buddy. That was amazing. Are you sure about this barbecue? Hundred percent. It 's Molly 's. I-I thought he was n't seeing Molly. He 's not. This needs to work. It 's gon na work. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Right here. Here you go, sir. Thank you very much. Uh... excuse... oh, excuse me... Here 's your change. Have a great day. Aw, thank you. Next. Hey! Well, good golly, Miss Molly! What can I get you? Probably get that a lot. Hey, this is great, though. Right? Congratulations. Oh, I also, uh, brought some of your... some of your items from the house. Did n't know if maybe you 'd have a break, and maybe we could talk? There 's a long line behind you. What would you like, sir? Two meat combo, ribs and brisket. You got it. I mean, we 're good, right? We do n't need to talk about everything. We 've known each other forever. I mean, we're-we 're floaters, right? We-we float in and out of each other 's lives. Riggs, leave my stuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 's actually why I 'm here. I have a business opportunity for you. Not interested. You know the, uh, Butler grocery stores in Texas? The owner wants to try your barbecue. Butler? You know Henry Butler? Having dinner with him tonight. And I promised him that you would cook for him... hey! Little something for the tip jar, bud. Yeah. That 's how you say thank you. So what do you say? Murtaugh 's, 7:00 tonight. Come on, Molly, your-your seasonings could be in every grocery store across the country. Okay, if I do this... What the hell is wrong with me? I would not be doing it as a favor for you. No. Beautiful. Riggs. Can you... See you tonight. Okay, Bailey checked the phone records. The Ortega brothers definitely called Butler. They must be the threatening phone calls he was talking about. So I 've got 5:05. Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because tonight has to go perfectly. Okay? We need to finish up here, get back to your place, shower, change and get to that dinner. Just relax. Everything 's gon na be fine. You-you listen to me. I 've never been more serious. I need to get back to my house. If this goes south tonight, I may be living with you forever. What time is it right now? 5:06. Let 's go. Miguel. You smell that? Hmm? I love the smell of fuel and motor oil. It reminds me of home. It sure does. Hmm. Hey, boys! Officers, can we help you? I 'm glad you asked. I 'd like to know why you drilled a forklift through a contractor named Sam Higgins. And make it quick, we 're, uh, on the clock. Yeah. You see, it was a big hole through the guy. I mean, the dude was a snake. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse, but he sold us out to some cowboy. Henry Butler? So, let me get this straight, you guys killed Sam, and then, what, you just threatened Mr. Butler? Is that right? Wait, no, no, listen. We did n't kill nobody. I mean, it was n't worth it. We bought another spot. I believe him. You? He 's got sincere eyes. Have a good day, gentlemen. Yep. The jack must be faulty. The jack must be faulty. Faulty jacks. Faulty ja... happens all the time. Yeah, let 's take a look at that. Yep. Here we go. We 're gon na be late. Yeah. Oh, come on. Now I 'm down to one shirt. You need to shower. I do n't know why you took so long to get ready. It 's ridiculous. Well, some of us actually care how we look. What the hell 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean? You 're late. Hi. Get in here. It 's his fault. Yeah, well, you know what? We 're here. I 'm just gon na run this right upstairs. It 's fine in the foyer for now. Yeah, but do n't you want to have... It 's fine in the foyer for now. You know what I 'm gon na do? I 'm gon na go make sureMolly does n't need... Nope. She said she does n't want you to. She specifically told me to tell you that. Classic Molly. That 's how we talk to each other. She... Okay, you guys, this is not about you, and it 's not about you. Yes, ma'am. Butler is in the other room, and he is ready to leave on a plane for Texas at any moment. That 's ' cause he has n't tried the barbecue. Once he tries that barbecue, it... And a mystery guest, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull out of the deal, decided to show up. So I have one night to sell Butler without alarming Azoulay. So there will be zero shenanigans. Say it. There will... no shenanigans. Say it. Z-Zero shenanigans. That 's right. That bag better go upstairs. It 'll be upstairs. Zero shenanigans. You 're the one. You 're the one that has all the... You 're Mr. Shenanigans. They really love the, uh, little barbecue sausage things. Did n't Trish tell youI specifically do not want your help? She did. But I think what she meant to say was that... I meant I do not want you out here.... that since I kind of left abruptly without an explanation that maybe an apology was in order. What? No. That is not what I want. And even if I did, I do n't want it now, when I am in the middle of cooking a potentially career-making meal. Molly, hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You disappeared. And now you just want to pop back in and explain yourself on your schedule. No. Listen, Molly, I... No, you just listen. We 've known each other for over 20 years. But you hurt me. Molly... And I do n't want to keep doing this, pretending we 're friends and-and you 're actinglike you 're helping me... Molly.... with some job. I mean, what is... Molly. Molly. Molly! What is it that you just ca n't keep yourself from saying?! Ribs. They 're ruined. I ruined them. W... I 've got chicken in the fryer. Now I 've got to prep new ribs. You 're a landmine, Riggs. This is probably whyTrish wanted me to... You are gon na go in there, stand by that fryer, and watch. When that chicken is gold, take it out. You think you can handle that? Well, so far, can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murtaugh will never let you down. She goes all out, even when she 's nottrying to sell you something. How do you mean? You 're doing that very thing this very moment. Uh, more wine, Mr. Butler? Why would we be trying to sell you on a deal that 's already closed? No, no, no, do n't say anything. Oh, I wonder where that chicken is. Yeah. The Ortegas were with theirPO at the time of the murder. They 're drug dealers, but they did n't kill Sam. However, I thought it was odd that they were willing to overpay for the lot where Butler was building his grocery stores. And? I got them to spill. The lot sits over an abandoned subway tunnel. Perfect for cooking, storing and moving drugs. That 's perfect for a drug dealer, but... why 's Butler willing to overpay? Bailey, pull those blueprints for me. I already tried. But Butler pulled some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Update on the ribs. They will be here imminently. Apparently, they 're being given a little extra love. Now, where was I? Uh, gentlemen, can we not agree that there 's value to selling even after the original deal has been struck? Take marriage, for example. Should n't a spouse have to prove his love to his wife every day? And should n't he want to? Trish. Hmm? What is your Longhorn friend doing with my blueprints? Roger. Roger 's gon na find out. Uh, he 's... he 's so good with... Riggs, this is coming very close to being categorized as a shenanigan. We need to give these plans back. Look, why was Butler willing to pay extra to build over these abandoned tunnels? Because my beautiful wife, who 's on the verge of letting me back in my house, is a great negotiator. Or he 's up to something. Or both are true, all right? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he paid for them, just like I paid for my sins with Trish by staying in your clammy, little trailer. Where is the vent? Right here. There 's a massive ventilation system running through the basement. No, the truck, not the... It 's a supermarket. Please, focus. See, this is what happens when people spend too much time together. You start not knowing what the words are. I do n't know what you 're saying. What if that 's why Butler 's venting the tunnels? Underground meth lab. Look. What is going on in here? Baby, how well do you know Butler? No. No! How well do you... Hold on, Trish. No, I do n't want to hold on. Just look at the draw... Trish, just look at the blueprint. Riggs! What 's burning? The chicken is done. That 's chicken? I thought that was possum. Please do n't throw the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch. What...? What are you doing? Are those the same clothes you wore last night? Oh, now I know what it feels like to be rock bottom. Another night in Riggs 's tin can, not even a toothbrush to my name. That 's a little dramatic, but okay. I thought you were back home. I was until Riggs decided that Butler is a meth dealer. Is he? I do n't know. I did n't even get a chance to stick around because I was banished. Hey. Did n't you and Todd just add on to your house? Right? Oh, thank God. Bailey! Urgent. Is everything okay? Yeah. Murtaugh was just, uh, taking me through your, uh, Butler theory. Very promising. Really? I thought it was pretty thin. How thin is it? Skeletal. All we know is that the property includes old subway tunnels ; other buyers were drug dealers, and Butler 's store will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na have to put some meat on those bones. Okay, so if we can prove thatButler was cooking meth, that 's motive for murder. We can solve the case and save Murtaugh 's marriage. And if we do that by midnight, I still win. You win what? The office pool. Do n't look at me. I already lost. So Molly was n't cool with things after all? Well, I mean, in her defense, I mean, I did ruin everything. You know, I mean, ruined the ribs, burnt the chicken, almost burned down her truck. Sounds like quite the night. Well, it 's classic Riggs. At least you were trying. That counts for something. Does it? I think so. Clearly you do n't. I just...... I 've been so selfish. You know? Doc, I think I may have ruined something good... something real. Well, everybody makes mistakes. And everybody deserves a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what will make you happy. He's-he 's just not sure. Man, tell him. Cap, I cracked this case wide open. With what? Squash. What? It 's like racquetball. It 's not like racquetball. I played in college. It is like racquetball. The balls are more dense. They do n't bounce. It requires finesse. Not the sport, the vegetable. According to this manifest, a truck of squash left Butler 's El Paso store weighing 20,000 pounds. But by the time it checked in at the next weigh station, it weighed 15,000. So there 's 5,000 pounds missing. Well, either somebody got a big payday or a big boost in fiber. So, how do we prove the 5,000 pounds is meth? We do n't. Oh, great. So I guess I 'll just have my mail delivered to Riggs 's now. But there may be another way. Butler was only paying taxes on the lighter weights that were logged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weights that were leaving the store. And that 's fraud, which is a good enough reason to get a search warrant and to call Trish. Come on. Now is not a good time, Roger. I am meeting Butler on his plane to try to save this deal. Trish, do not get on that plane. He 's dirty. Why? Because the man wants a well-ventilated basement? You have no proof of any of it. I have squash. Well, I think what you mean is squat, as in diddly, as in nothing. Nothing! Listen, Trish, there are major discrepancies in Butler 's squash shipments. All that extra weight that he 's not declaring could be drugs. Or it could be kielbasa or it could be beach balls or it could be a typo. Listen, I do n't have time for this. I have to catch Butler before his plane takes off. I have to go. Bye. Hello? This was a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn mess. I ask you to take care of someone, you do it quietly. Heavy machinery ai n't quiet. Monster-trucking a guy with a big-ass fork? Not quiet. I get it. Right. Thought I could make it look like an accident. An accident? Well, how 'd that work out for us? What were you thinking? Huh? Please do n't be a butt dial. Do n't be a butt dial. Hey, baby. Roger. Hey, you were right about Butler. You were right. Of course I am. Look, I 'm not the kind of guy who says I told you so, but baby, I told you so. Mrs. Murtaugh. Hello? Trish? Mr. Butler, I did n't see you there. Clearly. Plane 's ready for takeoff, Mrs. Murtaugh. Shall we? Well, listen, I just got a call that I have some business I need to take care of this morning. How about I meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 's not gon na work for me. I 'm a very busy man. Please. You know, I got to tell you, I apologize for interrupting your phone call. Hope it was n't too important. Actually, it was my husband. We were talking about you. Uh-huh. I was afraid that might be the case. Mr. Butler, I need to be honest with you. You really want to do this here? I do n't think I 'll have a chance to do it again. The business you bought was rezoned last year and you are overpaying. Now, the reason we did n't disclose it was because it would cost us money. Now... if you want to end it, I 'll understand. I ca n't believe the last thing I said to my beautiful wife, the mother of our children, is, " I told you so. " Well, you also ruined her grand opening. Oh, and-and the dinner party and you moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Is that Butler 's plane? Come on. Come on, Rog! Come on! Hey... no guns. What? Yeah. A bullet could hit Trish. You do n't thinkI understand cabin pressure? You do n't understand brushing your teeth, you do n't understandwashing your feet. What the... I do n't see her. What do you mean? I thought she was meetingButler on the plane. Hello. Trish. Roger! Where are you? Your phone keeps going to voice mail. I 'm 39,000 feet in the air. What?! Oh... You 're on Butler 's plane? Why are n't you? Defense attorney. I talked my way out of it. I am safely in my car. Hey, do you mind? Roger! Do n't shoot! I told you no guns. Hey, that was n't my fault. Uninvited guests once again, huh, fellas? Some welcome. You might wan na take your finger off that trigger. Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, I ai n't dying today, son. These are Glaser safety slugs, designed for air marshals. What do you say we put the weapons down, boys, huh? Slowly. Attaboy. Oh, Riggs! It 's okay, Rog. Just relax, I got this, okay? Of course you do. You 're a SEAL. You can land this thing in your sleep. With both hands tied behind your back, doing one-armed push-ups. Ai n't that right, baby-bubba? I think the autopilot 's locked. Oh, I ca n't... These things are much different than my crop dusters back in Texas, Rog. Oh, no, no, no, no! Hey. Parachute. You got another one? There 's only one. Oh, I ca n't go out like this, Riggs. Sorry, Rog. No! Aw, just kidding. Help me find something to tether us together. Together? That chute wo n't hold both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I have a wife, I have kids that depend on me. You... You do n't have nothing to live for, man. Hey... what if I want that? With Molly? Yeah, I mean, you know, maybe I want, like, a house and, you know, like, a picket fence and... yeah, maybe with Molly. That 's beautiful, Riggs. Thank you. You deserve that. I feel like I deserve it. You do. Rog, we 're running out of time. OkayOkay. You get... Yeah, that 's it. Go, go, go. And you be the hero? You take that. What are you talking about? Just put it on and go. I do n't want it. I 'm not gon na take it. I 'm not gon na... Okay, okay, so now we 're gon na jump out, and I 'm gon na try to catch the parachute in midair, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's the least of our worries, Rog. Riggs! Help! Pull the cord, Riggs! Pull the damn cord! Do n't take this the wrong way, Rog, but I need a little space. Tax fraud provided a warrant. I ca n't believe squash brought down a killer. It 's such an underrated vegetable. Not to mention sport. Now, the Texas Rangers are raiding meth labs in a dozen of Butler 's grocery stores. Speaking of a good haul... Are those matching robes? In the finest terrycloth. I finally have a houseguest. Murtaugh will want for nothing. They 're very plush, Scorsese. But I hope you kept the receipt. Why? Oh, hey, sorry, I, uh... left my duffle the other night. You jumped out of a plane. I know. There were... It was crazy. But there were extenuating circumstances. No, no, no, Roger. You jumped out of a plane... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I miss you, too. Welcome back, baby. I 'm so sorry. I acted like a big fool. No. No, no, no, no. I 'm sorry. I should have never run over... Hey, hey, hey... It does n't matter. We both dug in. I know, I know I did. But not anymore. No? From now on, I 'm letting everything go but you. Really? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, maybe we should go look for your duffle. I think I saw it somewhere in... the bedroom. Ooh. Ooh. I missed you. Excuse me, can I get a brisket sandwich? Oh, we 're all out for the day. We 'll see you tomorrow, though? Sorry about that. Not now. Just give me five minutes, and I 'll get out of your hair? You got two. I owed you an explanation when I ended things. I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. You treated me like regular people. I know. You broke my heart. I thought I was doing the right thing. Okay. Thanks for the apology. Molly. Hey... Hey, hey, hey. Are we good? Yeah, sure, Riggs, we 're good. Just, you know, consider us friends again. I do n't want to just be friends. Okay? I want more than that. Okay, well, then I 'm gon na need to know more. I need to know why. Why did you end it? Because my dad killed Ben 's dog. Why did n't you say something? What do you mean why did n't I say something? Molly, I was trying to protect you and Ben. Okay, okay, so you say you want me back. Well, what now? What 's changed? I 've changed. You tell me what you want me to do, and I 'll do it. You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known you, your dad has just cast this dark shadow. He walks into your life, and you smash up everything you 've worked so hard for. And it hurts people. I mean, he 's never gon na go away, so how are you gon na live your life? I do n't know. Well, you need to figure it out with your dad. That 's what I want
