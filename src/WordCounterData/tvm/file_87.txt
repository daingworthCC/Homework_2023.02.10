5226041 You ca n't do that! You 'll overload the accelerator and -- I did n't know what to do, so I called the Legion of Super-Heroes. It 's a little late. What do you need heroes for if the villain 's gone? Well, he 's not exactly gone. Look. It 's a temporal anomaly. Brainiac made it by rewiring the circuits, then overloading them. - Where does it lead? - lt could be anywhere. And any time. That means Brainiac could be changing the past. Or destroying the future. Is there a way of pulling him back? This thing is too far beyond our own technology. Let 's go. Did n't you hear me? I have no way of bringing you back. Let us worry about that. - This is crazy. - You asked for heroes. You did n't say anything about sanity. Well, we 're here. Wherever that is. And whenever. Over here. I think I know what Brainiac 's up to now. And if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, boy. You thought I would n't catch you, did n't you? He 's had trouble with kids coming onto his property at night, pulling pranks. - He means business. - You got that right, missy. Now, if y'all just move toward the house.... It 's all right. You wo n't be harmed. And you wo n't remember. Clark Kent. You promised to get me some punch, remember? Oh, sorry, Lana. I got sidetracked. - What 's this strange power you have? - What do you mean? The ability to attract every airhead in Smallville. Hey, Mr. Varsity! Airheads are n't the only ones. You may have made All-State, Kent but I can burn your butt any day of the week. Oh, yeah, Kenny? How about any night? You mean now? Okay, let 's do it. Clark, this is a dance. Kareem here says he can burn my butt. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Showed that loudmouth. - Did more than that. - You had to show him how tough you are. - Guess I do n't know my own strength. Maybe you should learn. Hey, it 's not like I meant to hurt him. It 's just that I 've been going through some changes lately. Me too. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Stop! There 's no reason! Ah, but there will be, Kal-El. There will be. Kal-El? I 'm not -- Just in time. Chameleon Boy. Cosmic Boy. Saturn Girl. Where are the other Legionnaires? Hey, it 's only you. - You saw? - Yeah, he touched his belt, then, poof. He 's built himself a spatial disrupter. Excuse me. It was something in the punch, right? We should be safe here. For the moment. Would n't hurt to have a disguise. Hold still. - Well? - Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone. - lt better. - Brainiac 's trying to alter our past. - And your future. He wants to kill you before you ever become Superman. " Super " who? Superman! You! Red underpants? Now I know you 're crazy. I realize all this is hard to take in, and maybe we do seem a little.... Freaky? But if you just open your mind. The thirtieth-century is an age of unparalleled peace and prosperity. But none of this would have been possible without you. Me? Superman showed that beings from different worlds could work together for a greater good. This is the principle on which the Legion of Super-Heroes was founded. But Brainiac would tear all this apart. He 's a living computer who destroys whole planets. Superman stopped him, but after years of dormancy Brainiac managed to reassemble himself. He 's made his way back here to destroy you. We 've got ta stop him. Our past depends on it. And your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close. Hey, he ran away. He did n't believe us. It was n't like this in the history tapes. Ah, a lucky break, that 's all it was. You 're lucky that 's the only thing that broke. Check out Darth Vader. Que pasa, man? Take a wrong turn at Tatooine? Where does Clark Kent live? Clark? What is this? Insufficient response. I repeat. - Where does - -? - State Road Seven. Where it dead ends. Thank you. Well, no one said this was gon na be easy. Pa! Jeez! You almost gave me a heart attack. - You have a visitor. - I just, uh -- - Hi, Clark. - Hi. I needed to tell you that I 'm sorry for walking away from you. It 's just that.... Uh, Jonathan? Are n't The Dukes of Hazzard on now? It 's just that you 've become so darn arrogant lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Oh, I 'm learning about that all right. What was that? He 's here. They 're in the living room, checking the closet. - How do you know? - I can see them. Who are they? What do they want? They want me. I 'm gon na try to draw them away. Whatever happens, stay down here. Are you crazy? You ca n't go up there. - What was that? - I do n't know, but I 'm going to find out. Do n't be foolish. You need something better than a shovel. Oh, no, you do n't. Pa! You want me, Brainiac? Here I am! We 'll take it from here. This guy 's mine. Not tonight. You two gon na be okay? Kal-El. Guess the history tapes were n't so far off after all. Clark, listen. You must get to the control on Brainiac 's belt. It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneels before me. This time, history will show that I am the superior survivor of Krypton. You know how to adjust it. You 're lucky you 're still in one piece, son. That was the worst twister to hit town in 20 years. Yeah, yeah. I do n't care. Just get me down! They do n't remember anything that happened last night? Nothing. I blocked everyone 's memories then made them think the damage was done by a storm. It 's just as well. I do n't know how I 'd explain any of it. What happens now? We 're gon na use the computer in Brainiac 's hover-chair to get us back to our time. Then I wo n't be seeing you again. Do n't look so sad. You 'll hardly miss us. What, are you kidding? After all you 've shown me? Just when we were getting to be buds. It 's not right for a person to know his own future. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up, up and away! I always wanted to say that. Hey, Clark. Come on, we 're gon na be late for class. Where 'd you get those? Uh, I 'm not sure. Well, what do you think? Are they me? You are so weird. [english]
