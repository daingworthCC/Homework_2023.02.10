5212341 Ripped by : dj-oRi Gentlemen, the world leaves us full of wonder most nights. Wondering if our children will follow in our footsteps. If our friends know how hard we push ourselves to rise to the top. Every Tuesday we come here and leave the world outside those doors. Tuesday is reserved for the men sitting at this table. Let ' s hope the steaks are rare, and the scotch is old. To William Ashbury. - It was very generous, Mr. Ashbury. - Please, call me William. I heard you lost the DeWitt deal. Tough turn of luck. Would n't you say that was a tough turn, Congressman? I would say a man makes his own luck. Next time one of these blow-hards loses a deal, you buy the drinks. Thank you, William. If you 'll excuse me. - Maybe we should call you a cab. - Thanks. I 'm okay. Tuesday is reserved for the men sitting at this table. A man makes his own luck. Every Tuesday we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Everything okay? - I 'm trying to find my registration. - What for? - I thought that you were... No, we closed the lane because there is a power line down. - Is that all? - No, that ' s not all. You have a headlight out. Are you sure? I just had this looked at last week. - Come see for yourself. - I do n't want to hold up traffic. I confess, I do n't want to get wet. Are you going to give me a ticket? Get it fixed first thing. Next time I write that ticket. - Okay, great, thank you! - Take it easy going through here. - Okay, thanks, officer. - Alright. I had an awful day. My students asked me questions I could n't answer. The market was so crowded. And my dress for the ball had to go to the dressmaker for a third time. And to top it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost the DeWitt deal. I know. I heard. But what I did n't hear was where you ran of until one o'clock in the morning. I killed a man on the way home. Come on. Honey, there 'll be other deals, okay? I 'm your wife. Run to me. Stop, stop, stop. You 'll be fine, ok? We 'll be fine. Honey. It ' s all over the news. God, it ' s awful. It was an accident. Really? How do you accidentally rob a bank? - What? - You 're saying... someone accidentally walked into the Trust, shot a guard, stole $2OO, OOO? And it was that sweet guard, too. He had two little girls. - He 's dead. - Where? Montgomery Trust. You go take a shower, ok? You 're late, get up. So pick me up at school at twelve. And we 'll go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, honey. Witnesses were unable to give us a description of his face. However, bank president, believes the man was a white male... in his mid-twenties, with dark hair. He was wearing a black leather jacket and blue jeans. Will you be there at eleven forty-five? I loved your shirt? Listen to this. This is crazy. The suspect was seen climbing into a 1993 Chevy Lumina... and speeding away with an accomplice. The vehicle was later found nearGrays Lane... but the suspects are still at large. My mom was in the Trust an hour before it happened. What? My mother was in the Trust an hour before the robbery. She always seems to find herself in the middle of some drama. Watch it. We 're going there for dinner tonight. It ' s not funny, okay? It could have been you or me. Now what time are you picking me up? I... could n't tell you. - Noon, honey. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth from me. Either stop taking this medicine, or quit drinking. Next time you could actually kill somebody. Do you understand? You go and close the Rossmoor deal. y dad is not going to pay the mortgage after this month. It ' s 2 years. - Ah, dear old dad. - Give me a kiss. Morning, Genie. You 're in trouble, Harrison. - Genie, what is all this? - Trash. What is it doing here? Yesterday it was our financial plan for the next fiscal year. You said the DeWitt estate was a done deal so I factored it in. - All $4,7OO, OOO. - Good. I mean, go ahead, draw up a new one. That would be a one-word statement. Default. Like I said, we are in trouble. Excuse me. What were you doing in the middle of the road? I 'm so sorry. Did you take that money? Did you? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I done? What do I do? Wynn. We would n't have been able to afford anything she showed us anyway. Whose fault is that? I 'm sorry, that was n't fair. I 'm sorry. No, I guess you 're right. Listen. I love you. Look, I do n't care about the furniture, I love you. We 'll just ask my father to help us out for a few more months. - You come up with a better plan. - lf you love me, you wo n't ask him. We 're going to be late. - I need to take a shower. - Fine, I 'll go ahead. You know how my father is about punctuality. - Harrison! - Allison. How are you? Is the semester over already? I need to find a date for the debutante ball. It ' s either you or William Ashbury. He 's here. Mom invited him for dinner. Well, I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Free limo ride... Free dinner? I 'm giving everything away for free that night. Excuse me, everyone, I 'm sorry I 'm late. - Nice of you to join us. - Why have n't you started eating? It ' s called etiquette. Sit down, Harrison. Ca n't you pass a law, honey? Someone has to protect us from the city 's crime getting closer every day. Do you know that I was in the Trust moments before it happened? I ca n't imagine the horror if I decided to deposit 5 checks instead of 4. $2OO, OOO, broad daylight. In April 1931, $75, OOO was stolen at gunpoint from the Trust. And shots were fired. The only casualty was an incontinence... on the part of an elderly teller. Eyewitnesses said there was an accomplice. I wonder if they were from the area. We have n't heard from Chris since his birthday. The day he walked out on his program at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to imply that it was Chris. Black hair. Black leather jacket. But I guess you 'd have to be sober to pull off a robbery. Stop it. Chris may be a lot of things, but he is not, and no Henderson is. Chris would not resort to stealing. Wish I could say it was Harrison. It would show some ingenuity. - He 'd steal from somebody else. - Enough. All we need is a little bit more moral support. We 're fine. Am I missing something? I paid the down payment on your house. I pay the mortgage. I introduced handsome to all of my contacts. He ca n't float the financing for a doghouse! But " we 're fine ". And you wonder why Chris is a junkie. I 'll go. Chris? - God, it ca n't be. - Overbearing fathers-in-law! - They have a reputation to live up to. - Congressman is doing just fine. He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decisions and choices he 's made in his life. He 's unforgiving of himself and others. Instead of buying you a drink last night, he let you stew all alone. He does n't think I belong at the table with the rest of you. - Do you? - I will. Yes, I believe you will. And in the meantime, you 're a lucky man. You have Wynn. No, no thank you, I have to go. - Where are you going at this time? - The office. Good. That ' s good honest work. Go. I 'm sorry, Chris. Honey, hurry. You are going to be late. Honey... do you have something you want to talk to me about? - Why? - Nothing. I have to go to work. I love you. I love you too. I want the number of every investor even if they only bought cookies. - What exactly are we doing, Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - We are? Why? - One word, Genie. Redemption. Ladies and gentlemen. The body of a white male... approximately 25 years old, was found at 2 : OO p.m. this afternoon. The apparent cause of death was blunt trauma. The victim 's body was uncovered in close proximity to the car... we believe was used in the Montgomery Trust robbery. However, at this juncture, it is premature to say... that this is connected to the robbery. We are treating them as separate cases... until the evidence tells us otherwise. Right, ten million dollars, can you believe it? No, go ahead, get excited! I 'm gon na get this one, I really am. I 'll be home in about 2O minutes. I love you too. Bye. At 2:55 they reported the discovery of a body nearGray 's Lane. There may be a witness, that according to Chief Webb. So what crime did you commit? Beg your pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tuesday-Saturday drinker. You know my drinking habits? Did you forget to pick up the dry cleaning or the dog at the vet? I could kill the dog and it ' d be in better shape than I 'm in now. The body was discovered by a passerby just off the roadway. The victim was wearing a black leather jacket and jeans. It ca n't be that bad. Ca n't be as bad losing the DeWitt estate. On Tuesday you had four. Tonight you 've been nursing that one drink. You have an amazing knack for detail. What is it you do? I could never get myself to settle on just one thing. - I figured you for an attorney. - Why? You need one? A fella could always use a good lawyer. Not always. He only needs one when he needs one. Now Police Chief Webb refuses to speculate. But News Three has learned there may be circumstantial evidence... tying the murder at Grays Lane to the robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Marcy Newell. Wynn, about last night, I 'm so... No, I 'm sorry. No, I do n't think you should go. I think you should wait for the report. Why you have to go? It ' s something you do n't need to. Okay. Fine. I 'll come with you then. I love you too. - They think it ' s Chris. - What? My mom filed a missing persons report... and she got a call from the morgue this morning. - It ' s not Chris. It ca n't be Chris. - Well then who is it, tell me? - I do n't know. - Then do n't say anything, okay? It was a very understandable misinterpretation. Your husband has a new secretary... and I guess he 's been spending time with her after office hours. But he is not having an affair. He was beating her up? No, her boyfriend was. Your husband found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe. He never slept with her? If either of you were going to step outside the relationship... it certainly would n't be John. Harrison French. Janey. Is everything okay? Wonderful. Just wonderful. Your wife does n't deserve this. I love Janey. I do n't know what I 'd do without her. Social fabric tears easily, John. A bad marriage is all it takes. Your career, your friends, these things can go away. Harrison, come in. Sorry. The door was open. John here was just headed out. Tuesdays, no exceptions. Please. Whatever you did wrong, now is the first step to getting a handle on it. I 'm afraid I 'm wasting your time, Mr. Ashbury. That ' s what you want, is n't it? To get a handle on things. You want to be back in control. Want to turn back to the way things were. When you were sure of all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear you will never take for granted again. You probably just want to tell someone. No. I do n't. I do n't know if I can. Sure you can. If I did n't love my wife so much, I 'd just run away from all of this. If I said I could help you... understood your fears... whatever it was, I could make it right, would you believe me? Let ' s get out of here. - You drive. - Where are we going? Wherever you want to take me. Shane! What are you doing, silly? What are you doing? What is this? Keep going. It was the night I lost the Dewitt Estate. I did n't see him it was an accident. Mrs. Henderson? I am Detective Scofield. How do you do? I 'm Wynn French. My daughter. I could n't face this on my own. I understand. Believe me. The Chief asked that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm more than happy to do... but I do n't know if it ' s actually necessary. The examiner is going to have the DNA results within the next 24 hours. And then we 'll know. We would n't dream of keeping you and the Congressman waiting. I want to see for myself if it is Chris. Are you sure you want to do this? All right then. Follow me. He does n't have a face. Did he have any kind of marks? Scars, tattoos anything like that? - He did. He had a tattoo. - He what? It was on his ankle, my mother did n't know about it. It was some sort of symbol, Chinese or Japanese. On his ankle? I 'm so sorry. Here 's my card. If I can be of any assistance... please do n't hesitate to call. We 'll do our best to find out what happened. - Did he do it? Chris? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point the only thing we know for sure is... that his body was found near the get-away car. But that ' s all we know. I 'm sorry for your loss. I 'm so sorry. I 'm so sorry. We have to go shopping. I never got him a birthday present. Do you like this? This is less than subtle, though. Do n't you think? Hey, Harrison. - Just you here? - Where 's your wife? You think I want to be here? I broke it off with this girl weeks ago. What about you? Do n't tell me you 're just here out of coincidence. - What are you talking about? - We work each other 's set-ups. - That ' s how it works. - How what works? You do n't get it, do you? Janey is probably nearby. Cover me! - Who 's that? - Who? That woman. With John. That ' s his cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping a little bit. That ' s a great shirt. It ' s a gift for John. You really like it? Of course he does. Harrison could n't lie to save his life. We 're on our way to 15 million. You 'd get one of the last seats. Excuse me. - Harrison? - Any progress? I 've got bad news. The DNA came back positive. I 'm sorry. But you must understand. Chris had a life of squandered chances. You have to focus on the road ahead. Wynn should n't have to lose both of the men she loves. - I 'm very impressed. - Impressed? The police are completely convinced that Chris robbed the Trust... then was killed by his accomplice. Well done. That ' s wonderful news. Thank you. I sympathize with you. Crimes have no in place in our community. People need to feel safe again. They need someone to be held accountable so they can move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this accomplice is an outsider. Someone who is never coming back. Chief. I 'm sorry to interrupt. We 're are trough. Something came in from the crime scene. I think you should take a look. - Hello? - We 've got work to do. - I thought it was tight. - You 'll spring a leak. We have to give them anothertrail. Inside the bag I gave you, you 'll find $200,000 in traceable bills. Put the bag inside the locker. Then wipe and get rid of the key. He called the house and I never called him back. Do n't think like that. Okay? Get in the car. It was a lovely service, sir. - How did it happen? - Excuse me? What did you do? - I swear. - Shut up, shut your mouth. I do n't really care what you did or who you did it to. You did it. It ' s done. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it. - Again? Sir, I. - Doug. My name is Doug. You and I are going to be spending a lot of time together... so we might as well be on a first-name basis. I appreciate that. I never wanted you here. I made that clear, did n't I? I 'm sorry, I 'm confused here. What? Why could n't you go someplace else? New people! Not here! You two could have made it anywhere! You really believe that? I thought so. Where are we going? It ' s Tuesday night. No exceptions. I do n't think your risk is that high. I 'm sorry, Doug. You should n't be out tonight. I 'm glad you made it. Harrison. - How did it go? - I did what you said. - We never discussed my fee. - I do n't have money. - I do n't want your money. - What then? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table. - Along with that comes a commitment. - What sort of commitment? Harrison, like yourself, each of these men, at some point... have made regretful mistakes. And with a little help, they 're trying to make up for them. Like a community service? Sort of. I saw John Sawgrass the other day at the mall. Screwing his secretary? He told me. I 'm trying to help John and Janey in their marriage... much the same way that I 'm trying to help you. It seemed like he did n't want to be there. Well, he 's making progress. I do n't know. You know, I 'm a bachelor. You 're the faithful husband. Talk to him if that ' s what he wants. That ' s what we 're about. You 're not on the outside looking in. That ' s what we 're here for. To keep each other on top. You alright? Good. C'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collin Flakes. He 'd bore me to death. Okay, you have to let Harrison do it. Alli, you could go with anybody. What am I supposed to do all night? I 'll just use him to walk on stage. It can not just be me and Dad. Please. Okay, fine. But I get him after the waltz. Fine. The limo is going to pick us up and take us to Mom 's at five. - I 'm coming. - Very nice. You look beautiful. Whatever he wants. I 'll meet him at McDonald 's if he brings 3 million. Two o'clock. I 'll be there. I got to go. Bye. - She says she ca n't get a date. - You 're kidding. You, please. I 'll owe you one! Allison. You are a vision. No, I 'm flesh and blood. You 'll approve before the night ' s over. Excuse me, I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't my hand. They 're coming to get you. Who 's coming? In 2 minutes the police will be there to take you in for questioning. Some peacekeeper from downtown. I thought you said I was tight. An ocean of adjectives, and the word " tight " keeps flopping ashore. I said you 'd " leak " and Harrison, you 've sprung quite a gusher. - What are you talking about? - They found... the body with says. - I 'm losing you. What? Tell the cop you 're waiting for your lawyer and do n't say a word. His name is Scofield. He was transferred from the city last year. - I hear you 're from the city. - Do you have a problem with that? No, I grew up there. - Yeah, Twelfth and Porter. - Get out of here. Second and Queen. - This going to take long? - Well, that all depends. On you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up BUT... I know you people have your little dance tonight... so you 're probably quite anxious to get out of here. - So Harry, what do you say... - Harrison. Was it Harrison at Twelfth and Porter? Listen, I have a very important lunch date to make today. I have a simple question. Give a satisfactory answer, we 'll be done. Well... you were waiting for me over an hour ago... yet you still have n't asked me what this is all about. If your visit was to be a surprise I suggest you learn to keep secrets. I 'm more interested in your secrets, Harrison. Your interest will fade fast as soon as my attorney arrives. Armed robbery, first degree murder, physical evidence. Your behavior is starting to look highly suspicious. An army of lawyers could n't dull you down, pal. I suggest you start explaining yourself. No house, no family. Relatively strong. - What do you think? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand. I ca n't miss this lunch. That ' s the problem with murder. It tends to wreak havoc on the social schedule. It ' s business, it ' s my business. Give them a call, tell them you have to reschedule... that you 're being questioned for murder! I think they 'll understand. If I miss this lunch, I will go bankrupt. I will lose my house, and probably my wife. Okay. Now we 're getting somewhere : Motive. I love this. I 've got to get out of here. Why do n't you just cut the crap, sit down, and tell me the truth? I 'm not saying another word until my lawyer gets here, alright. Sit down. Sit down. Explain to me how a sticker bearing your name... which numerous witnesses saw you wearing the day of the murder ended up 1O feet from the victim. - I do n't know. Explain that to me, and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I lost a very important account that day. And I threw it out the window. Threw it out the window? Here 's a name tag. So you 're driving along. and you take the name tag and you throw it out the window. Or did you throw it out the window like that? This sticker ended up fifty yards from the road. Hey, pal. Try again. It was windy that night. It could have blown there. I do n't know! I 'm going to tell you what I think. I know you needed money. I know you hated your father-in-law paying your mortgage. You and your brother-in-law decided to rob the Trust. I think you wanted to prove to your wife that she was n't slumming... by marrying a guy from downtown. And I know that something went wrong. Maybe you had a fight, maybe he wanted more money... maybe he tried to rob you, I do n't know. But something went wrong. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just one " hello " sticker away from pulling it all off. No? Alright. Then what? You tell me. You been hanging on by a thread ever since you got here. Your pulse is racing, you 're sweating. Why do n't you tell me the truth? Everything points to you! - How are you holding up? - Not good. I 've been here for hours. - Just calm down. - Calm down? You 're my lawyer! I 'll get you out of there. Just keep your finger in the dike. It ' s not that I do n't love sitting in your big beautiful car... but your new friend here has a train to catch. So. Where were we? Waiting for my lawyer. You 're putting a lot of trust in a guy who 's kept you hanging here. Okay. Your choice. There 's 2OO grand in the bag in the locker. You take half, understand? Do what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Show your face around here again, you wo n't have a cardboard box to live in. - I understand. Extra! Extra! This is the Montgomery Trust shooter? Suspect was seen boarding a train out of town. Better hurry up, you do n't want to be late to the ball. Thirty-two B five, Wall Street Station. I understand. Yes, it ' s coming in now. I 'm being selfish? You 've got a lot of nerve. Your ball was perfect. And now my date 's in the slammer. Not that it is n't sexy. Alli? Shut your legs. See, as for me, I do n't have any social schedule until this case is closed. So I can sit here all night. Mr. French? You 're free to go. What? Wait. What ' re you talking about? Metro got it. We covered part of the money, but our man hopped in a train. He could be anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing messing around with our case? Solving it apparently. Mr. French. Darren Paul, please. What do you mean a two week retreat? He just got back into town. No, no, no, no it ' s fine. Congressman. Wynn will bite your head off. Well, I had trouble at work today. Whatever you want to call it. Well, maybe you should slow your drinking. You know... eighty-three was a really bad year. You could n't trade an acre for a mule. That market had no bottom. Remember? I was in third grade. With a little creative accounting. I managed to evade Uncle Sam 's annual knock. Audits? Piece of cake. Thanks to William J. Ashbury Junior. Wharton whiz kid. He made it go away. Sir, you are drunk. Maybe you should quit while you are ahead. That ' s what I did. That ' s what I have to do. Again. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat on Uncle Sam. You cook the books until your ulcers bleed. You cheat on your wife. You screw that mistress until that is the last face you want to see. He 's like. he 's like a father who catches his kid smoking. Damn if he does n't make him smoke the whole pack. What did you do? That you 're going to do again? Do you see? Why I did n't want you here? I tried to run you off. I just got your back up. C'm on son. Allison is waiting for us. We have to pay for our sins. All of us. Chris paid for his. Accidents happen. They are not sins. Let ' s go, losers. We 're up. Things happen whether you want them to or not. - Terrible, terrible things. - Stop it, both of you. This is my night, and through it all, you 're just going to smile. See? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorted by her father, Congressman Douglas Henderson... and Harrison French. What the hell? My friends have a room. Allison. Let ' s do something we 'll both regret. - Do you love me? - How much have you had to drink? Not nearly enough to forget what happened this morning. Not nearly enough. Where 's Mom? She was here. Until she decided she found me unbearable. That ' s real nice. Gentlemen. - Have a drink. - No, thank you. You 're going to need one. So, have you been to the train station lately? We work each other 's set ups. It ' s not personal. What ' s up with him? It ' s Palmer 's night for atonement. It ' s payback. Is that your daughter? What can he do about her? Enjoy the ball. Is that your wife? - They 're friends. - Right. They 're old family friends. Right. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wynn 's a great woman. It ' s her choice. All I 'm going to say is, not even a choice in her mind. Right. Exactly. Enjoy the ball. We should get right back. Does n't look good, this sort of thing. The look of the thing only matters when the thing is no good. What I have for you is worth the impropriety. What ' s that? Happiness. Do you think I 'm unhappy? If there was one thing you could say the word and it would be yours. What would you ask for? Excuse me. Al-a-ka-zam. I thought you had something else in mind. I did. You said you would help me. And now you 're going after my wife? You 're supposed to say, " No, of course I 'm not after your wife ". " No, of course I 'm not going after your wife. " The police received these this morning. Chris 's partner in crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get. The real thief placing the money in the locker. - I did n't rob the Trust. - The police wo n't see it that way. Whatever it takes, I 'll find a way. I just want you off my back. Does n't work that way. You 're the prize of my collection. Cream of the crop. What are you talking about? Embezzlers, thieves, adulterers, but I never had a killer. Not until you came along. I 've got a little present for you. Chris Henderson. Should I give him to Wynn? Or you? Then you knocked. Just in time. He 's alive? Holed up downtown. Using his allowance to feed his baser instincts. What have you done? I gave your John Doe a personality. Chris ' rehab center runs blood tests twice a week. I switched the samples on your dead body. I just left the tattoo. Chief Webb is an old friend of mine, which grants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this to me? To my wife, her family? Come on. He 's a prodigal son with a nickel-a-day habit. He 's the kind of son that brings shame to a family, to a community. The kind of son we 'd all be better off without. - What are you saying? - I 'm saying you 'll kill him. You 're out of your mind. I 'm clean. Oh yes? Chris Henderson walks into town, they 'll reopen the case and you 'll go to jail. - I 'll take my chances. At nine A.M. tomorrow morning he walks out of my house a free man. He 's dead now, it ' s your job to keep it that way. What is going on? I do n't know. I was angry, I guess. How can you convince yourself that something 's impossible... when everything around you is telling you it ' s true? Just tell me... tell me what to do. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that you did n't kill my brother on Grays Lane. Tell me you did n't kill Chris. I did n't kill Chris. I love you so much. What do you want? He just walked out. Wait. Are you telling me Chief Webb threw this thing in Metro 's lap? I 'll tell you what, I 'm going to figure this thing out. I 'm going to solve this puppy, and when I do, I 'm back downtown. I been out here in purgatory long enough. Why would n't they reinstate? Have n't I paid for my sins? Listen, pal... not a word about this to anyone, okay? And thanks. I 'll get back to you. Yeah. I will, I will. What is going on here? Hey, hop in. Chris, get in the car. I 'll give you twenty bucks. Let ' s see it. You better not be trying to take me home. Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon. I startled you? - You did. - I was just admiring your property. Did you know this land was once owned by the Campbell family? Mr. Ashbury. I had way too much to drink last night. I know my behavior was inappropriate. I used to build forts up behind those trees. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell 's used to invite me in for dinner. - Delicious dinners. - I think you should leave. Your husband is a good man. He works so hard because he loves you so much. You 're very lucky. I just thought. I should drop by and tell you that. Why do n't you come in? I made iced tea. No, thank you, not today. I may cause trouble here. Thank you anyway. You 're very dramatic. But kind. Come over for dinner this weekend. You ca n't stay in that big house of yours all alone. Harrison and I insist. Dinner sounds nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fax number. Do you like your parents, even? Do you like to work? Bet you ca n't keep a job. I bet you shoot up anything you can get your hands on. What are you talking about? Chris, you 're not the only one with problems. I 'm talking about a solution. For you, and for me. How much do you think you 're worth? About 26 bucks. 27, if you tip the waitress. What are you getting at? I have a proposition for you. He wanted you to kill me? - Why did n't you? - I just wanted out, Chris. It would n't be the first time. Two weeks ago a friend of mine tried to kill me over money. You look a lot like him. - Who? - Your friend. The guy that I. The guy that I killed. Your sister identified his body thinking it was you. And your parents buried him. Were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're no killer. Not today. - I think we 're runnin ' on fumes here. - I wish. I have to go to the restroom. Hi, honey. I 'm on my way home. I 'm not really in the mood. They say why? Alright, fine, fine, I 'll be there. Surprise! - What ' s all this? - Genie called and told me. - What? - About the Rossmoor estate. - Oh, you talked to Darren? - William Ashbury. Mr. Ashbury guaranteed the bid. The property 's yours. He 's proud of you, Harrison. You must have had a hell of a day. Cheers. - What are you doing here? - I did n't think you were here. I 'm faxing the Rossmoor bid. I want it to be the first one they take out of the tray. - We 're not making the bid. - What? But with Mr. Ashbury, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is listed to? William J. Ashbury? - Detective. In my office now. - No. Chief... Close the door. Five minutes. You have 5 minutes to explain your connection to William J. Ashbury. - Is your husband around? - Detective. whatever it is you think he 's done, you 're wrong. It ' s not about what I think he 's done. I think he may be in trouble. Come in. The kid has balls. The only one's at this table. - Do you want more coffee? - Oh, thank you. - It ' s your husband's. - What is it? - He wants me to meet him. - I 'm coming with you. Hello? - Are you coming to see me? - Not you, your wife. It ' s about time she saw a few pictures. Good idea sticking a needle in the addict ' s arm. You better look in the bag first. Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you money means nothing to me. Not the money, keep digging. - Where are you? - Close. Real close. - What the hell are we doing here? - Are you ready? Pull yourself together, get in the car, let ' s get back to the club. - Are you ready? - Ready for what? To pull that trigger. The cash in your car... was stolen from Montgomery Trust. The gun with your fingerprints... was used to kill the guard at the bank. So it comes down to me or you. And all the evidence points to you. So can you pull that trigger? You question my resolve? That ' s your trump card? That ' s what you 're betting your life on? Because if you are, you 're going to lose. Maybe not. The prodigal son. Well done. Put it down, Ashbury! - Harrison! - Stay in the car! Stay in the car! Chris? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get hurt. - Who 's going to get hurt is you. - Are you going to hurt me? He 's not going to save you, boys. He 's gun-shy. That ' s what happens when you shoot an innocent man... for pulling his wallet. The father of three, am I correct? You do n't have family, Ashbury, and you 're far from innocent. That depends on how you look at it. Can you make others see what you see? I can. The way I see it. The cop 's got to go. Okay, honey, you ready? My mother called. She wants us to come over for dinner tonight. Can you make it early? I 'm getting a group together for drinks tonight. I thought maybe we could stay in and watch a movie. It ' s Tuesday night, honey. No exceptions. What is it about these Tuesday nights? Each of these guys, at some point, have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're trying to make up for it. Like a community service? Well sort of. Ripped by : dj-oRi
