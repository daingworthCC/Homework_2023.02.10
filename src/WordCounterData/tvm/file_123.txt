5233041 Hmm... What is taking you so long? You have the first turn. You can put any word down. Do n't rush me. Is " dogarf " a word? I 'm not telling you. You 're fun to play with. Is " fodgrf " a word? If you ca n't say it, it 's probably not a word. Ok, fine. " Darvog "? - What? - I challenge. " Darvog " is a word. Use it in a sentence. I just did. " Darvog " is a word. That 's a sentence. Do you not know what a sentence is? Because if you do n't know what a sentence is, we should n't play. It would be like playing with a child. You want something to eat? I am darvogged. I just invented a new sandwich. I took peanut butter and spread it on a piece of bread. And then, on the other piece of bread, I put some jelly. I call it a jelly and peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination. Do n't move. Why? Spider. Where? Where is it? Is it on me? Get it off me! Get out of the way! - Uhh huh huh! - Where did it go? What did it look like? It was the biggest spider I 've ever seen. Ooh! Ooh! Uhh! What are you doing? I 'm gon na kill it. Are you mad? You ca n't do that. You need to capture it and take it outside... And then kill it. We do n't want that mess in here. The maid just cleaned. We do n't have a maid. I meant you. Hey, guys! Uhh! Spider! Lola! Oh, did you like that lamp? Let me get you another one. Seriously, it 's no problem. I can go right now. I 'm 8 hours early for our date anyway. I do n't see the spider. Oh, I missed him. He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard this story once about a spider that crawled inside this man 's ear and laid its eggs in there, and the spider babies ate his brain. Well, time to go lamp shopping! You know what, I should go help Lola with that lamp. Lamps can be pretty tricky. Wait for me! I 'm not getting killed by a spider today! A jpb? I think that sounds good. I invented a sandwich once. You take a piece of bread, a piece of cheese, a bunch of ice cream, a little more bread, some fish sticks, a little syrup, and then the heel of the bread. I call it a darvog. Ah! I knew that was a word. You ca n't do anything until he 's been missing for 24 hours? But this is an emergency! You 're the police! What if something terrible 's happened to him? No, you calm down! I ca n't stand it! We 're looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not looking for a tosh. We 're looking for a lamp. What 's a tosh? Tosh, my dear friend! He went to mail a letter, but he never came back! Oh, dear. How long has he been gone? 10 minutes! Oh, poor thing. We 're never apart. I just know something terrible has happened to him! 11 minutes! Tosh! That 's the worst thing I 've ever heard. When I heard about this guy who had a spider lay babies in his ear and eat his brain. Oh! Tears wo n't bring your friend back. Right now, time is our enemy. In the case of an abduction, every second counts. Listen to me. If we do n't find your friend soon, the chances are, you will never see him again. Oh, sorry. May I? We 'll take your case. Oh, are you private detectives? No, but I ca n't go home until bugs takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent way to kill some time. Now, can you give us a general physical description of the victim? Victim?! Hey! The clock... it 's ticking. All right. High cheekbones, big expressive eyes, athletic build. Oh, no, wait! That one 's me. This is Tosh. What 's his height? About 9 1/2 inches tall. Weight? Now, he 'll tell you he 's 3/4 of a pound, but between you, me, and the fencepost... He 's at least a pound, but he carries it well. It 's gon na be ok. Believe me, I have a sixth sense about these things. I 've got sight, I 've got hearing, I 've got taste, I 've got smell. - What is the other one? - Touch? Oh, thanks. I 'm flattered, but I 'm trying to think of the other sense. Whatever it is, I 've got it. But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor. Boo brr boo bbb boo! Bbb bboo ddoo doo dooo pplll! Mm mmew! I guarantee you we will find your friend. But just in case we do n't, we 'll go ahead and take the lamp now so it 's not awkward later, you know. - Ohh! Lola, I ca n't talk right now. Oh, it 's no problem. Just wanted you to know that daffy and I are gon na be a little late. We 're investigating a missing person 's case. Mmhmm. But the good news is we got you a new lamp, and it looks exactly like your old one, except it 's a different color and the base is a little wider... a lot wider. And the shade 's different. It 's a weird shade. Aah! You know, you could at least see it before you judge it. Unbelievable, that guy. Tell me about it. Try living with him. What are we doing here again? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them up all over town, get the public involved. Plus, I get the 10% friends and family discount here. Hey, guys! I do n't have time to chitchat. Lola and I are in a race against the clock to save a life. One of the gophers is missing. That 's terrible. How long has he been gone? - 15. - Days? Minutes. And every second I spend talking to you is a second I do n't have. Now, do you have a dollar? I want to get something from the vending machine. Thanks. Put it on my tab. Minus 10%. Look, I know what you 're thinking. Daffy and I working side by side in an emotionally charged environment? How easy it is for two people bonded by a shared experience to become romantically intertwined. I just want you to know that is not gon na happen with me and daffy. Yeah. I was n't worried. Ok, now that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flyer. Ooh! What about a reward? Good idea! But how do you put a dollar amount on a human life? What am I talking about? He 's a gopher. Put 5 bucks. All right, now, let 's put the photo of Tosh here. We do n't have a photo. What we also do n't have is time, Lola. That gopher 's been gone for 16 minutes. Maybe we should just give up and go home. You do n't mean that. And the spider 's still there, so, remember, you ca n't go home. You 're right. We do n't have a photo. We 'll have to draw a picture of him. Ooh! Ok, not to brag, but I have been told I am a great artist. Oh, no, wait. I 've been told I 'm a great flautist. No, that does n't make sense. I do n't play the flaut. Maybe I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about? Drawing the gopher. Ooh! I 'll do it. Not to brag, but I 've been told I 'm a great artist. Yes, ok... Shade that part... How 's that? I do n't know. Just those two big teeth in front? He looks like a hillbilly. No offense. How about that? Better. What about putting him in clothes? You know, like, maybe a white outfit to signify his purity? Ooh, yeah, like he 's the innocent victim. I like that. Hmm. Now it 's a little too much white. Maybe he needs a pop of color. Ooh! That looks good. What about a hat? Give him a little personality, like, " hey, look at me. I got a hat on. " Oh, yeah, that 's our guy. Let 's see what kind of spider we 're dealing with here. Uhh! This kind of looks like him. " African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Latin for... Murderer "? " The venom of the six-eyed sand spider is highly toxic " and causes blood vessel leakage tissue destruction, and multi-organ breakdown "? Aah! Check out my n-new driving gloves. W-why are you so jumpy? There 's a killer spider in the house. A kkiller spider? You m-mean that one? W-what do we do? Just calm down. Let me get on your shoulders. II just had my jacket cleaned. Fine. Get on my shoulders. Oh! You 're real solid, are n't you? I... Do n't know about this. You can do this, porky. Ddo we have to g-get so close? It 's a spider. It 's not gon na jump on you. Aah! It 's on my face! - Kill it! - But it 's on my face! Stab it! Get off me! Porky, you 're panicking! There 's a p-poisonous spider on my face! Aaah! Aaah! Wwhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tosh 's destination. Did he make it? There 's only one way to find out : Dust for fingerprints. Right. Yes. Dust for fingerprints. You know what, we do n't need fingerprints. Let 's run some forensics. Right, forensics. Love forensics. Big fan of forensics. Now that I think about it, all we really need is a DNA sample. Right. One sample of DNA coming up. You want to just crawl inside and see if he 's in there? Ooh! Fun! Nope! No gopher. Ooh, but there 's tons of mail in here. Oh, really? Hmm. Not as roomy as I thought it would be. Nnow what do we do? Hey, boy! You 're a good guard dog, right? There 's an intruder in the house. You think you can get him? Good boy! Then go in there and get him! Bye-bye. Wwell, it 's getting late. It l-looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just go now. I 'll g-get my driving gloves some other time! What do we know? We know climbing inside a mailbox is against the law. What else? The fire department 's not happy when they have to use the jaws of life to pry you out of a mailbox. What else? The city says you have to pay to replace the mailbox or do 1,100 hours of community service. What else? Tosh has been missing for 28 minutes and we still have n't found him. Oh, right, the gopher. I totally forgot about that whole situation. Well, I guess we 're back to square one. Or... Uhhuh, uh-huh, interesting... Maybe, could be... Ahh! I like where you 're going with this. I had n't thought of that. You 're good! What do you think? I think this is just the break we 've been looking for. Yeah, I think we 'll be able to focus a lot better after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous gas, so that 'll take care of your spider. Just do n't go back inside for 24 hours. You do n't want to breathe that stuff in. Oh, and thanks for the driving gloves! Do n't mention it. Hi, Mr. bunny. Hey, gossamer, what 's the matter? My pet ran away. Aw, I 'm sorry. His name 's Webster. He looks like an African sand spider, but he 's actually harmless. I really miss him. Can you please let me know if you see him? Gossamer! Look who I found. That 's not Webster. There he is! Oh, I missed you so much, buddy. I thought those cookies would help us focus, but now I 'm just really full and tired and a little sick. Well, the gopher 's been gone an hour anyway. I think we should just assume the worst and get on with our lives. But how are we gon na break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. E-mail? Text? The beauty of today 's electronic devices is that they allow you to maintain a cool distance when delivering upsetting news. Ah! Or maybe we do n't have to break the news after all. Come on! Got ta keep that blood sugar up. Where are you, Tosh? Oh, wait. That 's me. Where are you, Tosh? We found your friend! Where is he? Tada! I guess this case is closed. Oh, Tosh! Where were you? Why? Whatever do you mean? After I went to the mailbox, I spent an hour in the park. I thought it would be good to have a little time to myself, but the truth of the matter is, I hated every second of it! Turns out, I did n't want time to myself. I just want to be with you. Well, why did n't you tell me? You could have at least left a note. But I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register. " Dear Mac, I 'm going to the park " to spend a little time alone. " I 'm sure I 'll hate it. Did n't want you to worry. Xoxoxo, Tosh. " You know what, I should go help bugs... Kill that spider. Spiders can be pretty tricky. What, are you nuts? Why were you handling a poisonous spider? You 're lucky we did n't have to amputate. Am I gon na be ok? You 'll be fine. Just go home. Get some rest. Oh. The exterminator said I ca n't go home until tomorrow. Well, you do n't have to go home, but you ca n't stay here. Put this on twice a day. - What is it? - Darvog. It 's an anti-inflammatory. Better than amputating! How many hours until we can go home? 19. Who 's your friend? I 'm still deciding on a name. Right now, it 's between lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go wrong with either one, except for that first one. I 'm starving! What is taking so long? Yeah, where 's speedy? Oh, I missed you so much! I missed you so much! Well, I missed you more. Oh, do n't be silly. I missed you more. All right, gopher! Gim me my $5.00! I told you, I 'm not a gopher!? Standin ' there with a blade in your hand?? Yosemite Sam, do n't you understand??? I 'm your moostache?? do n't shave your moostache?? been with you since the day you were born?? all that time, I 've never been shorn?? what would you do without your flavor saver?? putting ' aside those crumbs for later??? very first time that you kissed a girl??
