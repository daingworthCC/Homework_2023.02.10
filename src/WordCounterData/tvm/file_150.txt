5238241 " I 've had it with these cheap trash bags. They leak and break and end up costing us more. " - I believe it. - Yeah. It was a great audition. I was all about things leaking. How could they not pick me? - They do n't know what they missed. - They gave it to a blond in a skintight leather cat suit. She 's supposed to be a housewife. She looked like Catwoman taking out the cat-trash. - You gon na answer the phone? - Good question. Oh, yeah, right. - Angel Investigations, - Machine got it. We help the helpless, If that 's you, leave a message, Hey, Cordy, It 's Aura, I just wanted to check in see how you 're doing and everything, You would not believe what.... You do n't want to talk to her? Not just yet. She 's gon na ask me about where I 'm living, how the acting 's going. I 'm just not up for leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when things are better. - I ca n't help with the acting. - But about the apartment -- - What? Well, if you ever want to spend one night away from the place maybe give me a call. Well, stranger things have happened. No, wait. They really have n't. I 'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Angel. I 'm taking off. She 's really something, is n't she? It 's like wrestling a tiger just to get to know her. - Tell me stuff. - What stuff? About Cordelia. Well, I know she ca n't type or file. Till today, I had some hope regarding the phone. Who 's Aura? Oh, she 's.... I think she 's one of Cordelia 's group. People called them " The Cordettes. " Girls from wealthy families. They ruled the high school. It was like the Soviet secret police, if they cared a lot about shoes. And she was the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she had servants made of solid gold. Pretty much. Till her parents lost it all. - Riches to rags. - That 's one hell of a comedown. But she 's doing all right, Ouch! Damn it! Yeah, well. Of course. Hi, this is Cordelia Chase from apartment 4B. I thought you were gon na have the exterminator in here today. Well, if he had, would n't there be - -? Oh, my God! Doyle. Doyle. Doyle. Doyle.... Hello, Doyle. - You have the wrong place. - You owe money. It 's all about money. What about friendship, family and priceless things like they say in the credit card commercial? Oh, yeah, right. You 're a demon of focus. I can see that. I have your money right over here. You 're not stupid enough to have a gun in there. Right? Me? No way, man. Look! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel. It 's so terrible. Oh, my gosh. Do n't even look at me. I am such a mess. I am the lowest of the lowest. You 're gon na want to get my other suitcase out in the hall. - What happened? - My apartment. It 's like the barrio or the projects or whatever. And I live there. I am a girl from the projects. I do n't know about that. Get this. I tried to call Doyle - - I have sunk that low. And there was no answer, so here I am. Not that you were the last resort, but I had nowhere else to go. Roaches. Live ones, dead ones. All skinny feet and creepy antlers. - Antlers? - Oh, my God. I wonder how many are in that bag. Also, the water is all brown and spurty and not hot. I am dying for a shower. I actually smell. Smell me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'll have to stay here until I find a place, however long that takes. When I do, you 're invited over. You can just dump my stuff on your couch or let me have the bed, whatever you feel good about. My suitcase is still out in the hall. Your shower 's in here, right? Do you have mousse? Of course you do. - Angel, you around? - Hey, Doyle. You ever get that feeling like you just ca n't shower enough like you 'll never be clean? - You got peanut butter on the bed. - Really? I do n't think so. I 'll look. No, no, no, no, no. Angel, how could you? How could I what? You know I was crazy about her. I was wearing her down too. But, no. Handsome, brooding vampire guy has to swoop in all sensitive mouth and overhanging forehead. How about leaving some scraps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I was on the sofa. That 's okay, I suppose. At some point in recent history, you got peanut butter on the bed. It 's gross. You 'd better change the sheets. I do n't eat. Then I do n't even want to know how it got there. Hey, you 're looking great. I would n't know. Man does n't have a mirror. Like it 'd kill him to not see himself? I was wondering if anybody called lately maybe asking about me or wanting my address? Your cousin called with one of those names from your part of England. - My part of England? - Connor or Fergus-- Did he find you? Yeah. He did, all right. A little warning might have been nice. Give a fella a chance to neat the place up. Jeez, I only helped the guy as a favor to you. Maybe next time I wo n't bother. You do n't even have to pick up the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's an idea. Give me a list of the people you 're too good to talk to. - What 's going on? - Nothing. Just.... - You got a bruise on your hand. - Badminton. And the reason there 's a wet towel on my leather chair? Thank you. What are you doing? I just wanted to see if he had hardwood floors under here. I might be here awhile. The things you learn. I had no idea Angel was Queen of the Winter Ball. Those are mine. Tough stuff! Your diploma 's all burned. Yeah. It was a rough ceremony. Yeah. There it is. My whole life, pre-here. Five trophies, with some of the shiny worn off. It 's good you can look back. - I never look back. - At what? Doyle. Is he down here? There you are. A big guy 's here to see you. - I 'll tell him you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not nice to trick people. You gon na tell me what 's going on? You do n't even know who the demon 's collecting for. Here 's how it works. I owe some people, other people owe me. I do a favor, the debt goes away. It 's a system of checks and balances. Some of your checks did n't balance. Well, it 'll work out. It just takes a little diplomacy. The kind of thing you 're so good at, actually. Maybe you could take a crack at it. We all have problems. At the moment, I have a bigger one than you do. - Bigger than a Kailiff demon? - Much. You can help me with mine, and I can help you with yours. I do n't know, man. I mean, what 's your problem exactly because vampire business is.... Hi. I was wondering if you had any linoleum glue for if it started curling up all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her an apartment, and I 'll deal with your demon. I wish you 'd let me call my guy. He probably judges the property value on how far the bus ride is to the track. It ca n't get any worse than this. You ca n't tell from the hallway. Hey, you 're right. You know what I smell in here? Potential. The next one 'll be better. It 's like a community. We share all the upkeep and chores. My urination has n't been public enough lately. We do n't believe in barriers. It 's the first rule of the Great Leader. You can come to meetings. Mornings at 5. Okay. That 's just a touch too early for me. Oh, you 'll be up. The chanting starts at 4. So, you a single gal? Gon na be living here alone? I 'm right across the hall. You can sleep easy knowing I 'm the only other soul with a key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, okay? Okay, just out of curiosity, you say you know a guy? What is it with you and Angel? You do everything the hard way. Oh, my gosh. Have you ever seen anything so beautiful? No. Never. It 's perfect. Really, really, it 's just perfect. It 's amazing in there. - What 's wrong with it? - Nothing 's wrong with it. The previous tenant just broke their lease. I do n't know how you heard about it. It 's quite a bargain. And the furniture comes with. Do you think you want it? I used to have this. I was -- - I guess it 's your lucky day. - I used to have those too. - Yeah, she 'll take it. - I 'll fill out the rental forms. First thing, I hire someone to take out that wall. - I thought it was perfect. - And part of it being perfect is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be why you find me so fascinating. Oh, my gosh. I love my apartment! Your guy found the perfect place. I love your guy! It 's a pretty good day 's work for us. I take care of your problem Angel takes care of mine. Things are pretty sweet. Yes! I can move right in. - My name 's Angel. What 's yours? - Screw you. My name 's Angel. What 's yours? - Griff. - Good start. Who do you work for? He never gave me his card. I do n't know his name. - You can get a message back to him? - Yeah. - You 're letting me go? - I 'm letting you up. - You were sent to collect for Doyle? - At first. But I 'm not seeing any money. So now Doyle gets dead. A message for the others. And your boss never gets his money. Expensive message, with what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get Doyle to pay you. You have my guarantee. I saw what I saw, right? You 're a vampire. How come you 're helping some demon half-breed7. It 's a good offer. You should take it. On the other hand, you 're making me want to fight. You get lucky, you might last 10 minutes. Really lucky, and you 're unconscious for the last five. You get Doyle to pay, and he 's safe. Thanks. Good meeting. What do you think you 're doing here? You never should have come, I have to pay? Man, I should have just handled this myself. I do n't have the money. You ca n't get blood out of a stone. They can get blood out of you. There 's a price on your head. They were n't looking for money. Thanks, man. You probably saved my life. Can I ask you something? - Why do you live like this? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, well I guess it 's the kind of life that keeps your expectations from getting too high. - Seems like you 'd understand. - I do. Yeah. I do n't know why it 's important to you. This kind of life sort of picked me. You do n't have to do it this way. - What happened? - Do n't worry about it. And things are n't all gloom in Doyle City. I mean, there 's bright spots. Like Cordelia. I mean, she loves that new place so much, man. She 's gon na be grateful for a long time. I knew this was too good to be true. I knew it. I 'm from Sunnydale! You 're not scaring me, you know! You 're not scaring me.... one bit. Bright, shiny morning. Nothing bad here. You know what? I get it. You 're a ghost. You 're dead. Big accomplishment. Move on! You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold wind. Scary. What are you gon na do, chap me to death? What else you got? Cordelia, you in there? Cordelia? Cactus. It 's a housewarming present. Hi. Thanks. I 'm still getting it the way I want it. Maybe in a few days. The place looks great. You worry too much. But what did you have against that chair? Oh, right, you ca n't come in. Wait. What about the rule? You said when you got a place, I was invited over. I did n't have a place then. The rules are getting screwed up! - Do n't touch that! - I 'm closing these so our boss does n't burst into flames. Okay? Yeah. I guess. It 's nice. How about a tour? The kitchen, living room. I 'll knock out that wall. - Thanks for the cactus. - How can you afford this? I bet you want lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing 's been doing that all morning. I think the mantle is uneven. It lunged at me. What 's going on? Okay, you 're right. It 's not the mantle. It 's a very, very bad trophy. - Dear sweet.... - Come on. I 'm not giving up this place. - It 's haunted. - It 's rent-controlled! - It says, " Die. " - Maybe it 's not done yet. Maybe it 's " Diet. " That 's friendly, if a little judgmental, sure. I am not giving it up. It 's perfect and beautiful. It 's so me. I need it. It 's just a place. - You 're more than that. - How? How am I more than that? We could cleanse it. We could try. Ca n't we? Put the ghost to rest. - Can we? - We can try. - We 'll figure it out at the office. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't won a thing! I 'll die before I give up this apartment! I 'll die! All right, dear, If that 's what you think is best, A lot here about the building. - Construction bids, inspections -- - We need people who lived there. And died there. The ingredients for ghosts. Yeah. This is n't easy, you know. You know, this really is just a place to live. No, it 's more. It 's beautiful. - And if it goes away, it 's like -- - Like what? - Like I 'm still getting punished. - Punished? - For what? - I do n't know. For how I was. For everything I said in high school because I could get away with it. And then it all ended, and I had to pay. But this apartment - - I could be me again. Punishment over. Welcome back to your life. Like I could n't be that awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like you. Working for redemption. No, because you had that mansion. I found something. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a death. First person to live in your place, Maude Pearson. - How 'd you get it? - Pearson Arms is carved over the entrance. I checked the obits for Pearson. We got lucky. Maude Pearson built the place and took a unit there. In 1946, she died of a heart attack in Cordelia 's living room at age 57. That 's it! That 's her. It 's not a violent death. - Ghosts are usually -- - I know it 's her. The place has that weird little-old-lady smell like violets and Aspercreme. They did n't find her for 3 weeks, so it was n't violets at the end. This is easy. Little-old-lady ghost hanging around because she left the iron on. Get a cleansing spell and do it. It 's not easy. Hawthorn berries, lungwort and bile. I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in Koreatown, does these spells all the time. Goody. One of Doyle 's guys. Is this the same guy that helped me find my poltergeist-elicious apartment? Doyle, go. Get what you need. I 'm gon na try to get more information. Maybe Kate can find something. How come Patrick Swayze 's never dead when you need him? Angel Investigations, We help the hopeless, If that 's you, leave a message, Cordelia, are you there? I think we can end this thing, I 'm here. About time you called. You got something? Meet me at your apartment, We 'll figure out what to do, Okay. Cordelia, I 'm in the bedroom. Angel? You got my call. Poor thing. You just do n't fit in around here, do you? Oh, too bad you would n't leave my son alone. Your son? - I wish I could be more help. - It 's okay. Just knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you 're talking like a detective. - I am one. The thing about detectives is, they have r? sum? s business licenses and last names. - Pop stars and popes have one name. - I 'm a pope. Here you go. Davis, you are beautiful. Thank you. Let 's take a look. I did n't know you had records that old. Me neither. Let 's see. There was an investigation into the death. This guy, Detective Randall, thought the death was suspicious. The M.E. called it a heart attack but there were problems with the son, Dennis Pearson. - He lived with her. They argued a lot. - What about? A girl. His fianc? e. Mom did n't like her. Dennis skips town with her the day Mom dies. What a coincidence. - Cops never caught him. - Unavenged murder. - Sounds like. - But no other deaths in the apartment. You saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls. No, not murders. Suicides. There 's a kind of killer that does that. Makes it look like a suicide. There are always signs. There. Margo Dressner, 1959. And Jenny Kim, 1965. Natalie Davis, 5 years ago. All in the same apartment. I 've got ta make a call. Angel Investigations. We hope you 're helpless. - Wait -- - It 's me. Put Cordelia on. She 's not here. Hang on, there 's a message. Are you there? We can end this thing, I 'm here, About time you called, You got something? Meet me at your apartment, We 'll figure out what to do, That 's not me. Whoever you think you 're talking to, it 's not me. My name is Cordelia. Oh, that 's the name of a cheap, small-town tramp trying to sound better than she is. You 're not good enough for my boy. This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friends will come here. You do n't have friends. Why would anyone care about you? Nobody really cares. You do n't deserve to live here. You do n't deserve anything. We were right about the ghost. It 's Mrs. Pearson. - Her son killed her. - A murder victim? Filled with rage and confusion. That 's why she 's been killing people. That 's a pretty strong ghost. Bile. I should 've got more bile. I will leave. Please. Oh, I do n't think so. - You 're worthless. - No. You 've never been kind or smart. You 're a user. You 're nothing. Everyone would be glad if you were dead. - No. - Oh, come on. If anyone really cared about you, would you be here? People let you end up here because they were happy to see you fail. I got her. Okay. All right. The furniture and the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing it all. She 'll be back. She 's stronger than us. She knows me. - We can stop her. - No. No, we ca n't stop her. She 's made a connection with you. She thinks you 're someone she blames for her murder. - Answer me. - I 'm, I 'm.... I 'm taking her son away. She thinks I 'm taking her son. That 's good. Her son killed her. You 're playing a role in her delusion. You can stop her. Start the binding circle. I 'll find the spell. " Bring the truth into the light. Let it be revealed that the soul can take its place in eternity. " She 's coming! She knows what we 're doing! - We need Cordelia now. - Cordy, get up! Cordelia, stand in the circle! Strike at its center! What? You know what it means. She 's in contact with you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail. - You 're a whore with no money. - Doyle, chant. Oh, man, Latin! One of those dead languages you always mean to learn! V sounds like W. Say each vowel separately. You do know what to do. You can stop all this. I ca n't. Look at you. You 're gon na let her do this to you? Damn it! You 're Cordelia Chase. Are you just gon na lie there? Get off your ass! Be tough! I ca n't, I ca n't! You can be the biggest pain. Do it now! - This wo n't work. - It 's getting dodgy here! We got ta get her out of here. This is n't safe. Nobody 's going anywhere. - What 's this? - You were gon na let him pay. I lied. No more people! - What is this? - Ignore her. It 's just a ghost. Get out! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got it in my wallet! This is my house. Knives! I 'll leave. I 'm sorry your son killed you. You can have the apartment. Just let me go. - It 's too late for that. - No. You know what happens next. Your friends are dirty. They ruined my nice home. I knew you were trouble from the start. I 'm surprised that my son did n't smell the stench of poverty and failure on you. I can. I 'm sorry. You better be sorry, you stupid little bitch. I 'm a bitch. Take off the bed sheets. Make a noose. Go on. It 'll all be over soon. I 'm not a sniveling, whiny, little cry-Buffy. I 'm the nastiest girl in Sunnydale history. I take crap from no one. You 're going to make yourself a noose and put it around -- Back off, Polygrip! You think you 're bad? All mean and haunty picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haul your wrinkly, translucent ass out of this place because, lady, the bitch is back. Do you think I 'm going to take that from trash like you? I 'll tell you what I think. You 're gon na pack your little ghost bags and get the hell out of my house! What happened? You did it. Yeah, well, she pissed me off. Well, maybe you found her center. Cordy, what 's wrong? Cordelia! Look what you 're making me do, Dennis. Mom, stop it. How you gon na leave now, huh? How you gon na marry that streetwalker now? You are nothing without me. Mom, do n't do this, please. This is crazy. Mom? I ca n't breathe. Please! Let me out! Please, Mom, I 'll be good! I wo n't leave you! I promise! Mom, please! This hurts me more than it hurts you. Goodbye, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with his mum. Dennis, it was for your own good. I had to do it. She would 've made your life miserable. I 'm sorry. Please! Please! I knew I did n't like that wall. There. Safe as houses. You 're gon na live like this? Adding a dead bolt wo n't have a huge effect on my life. You know what I mean. Well, there might be misunderstandings that sort of thing. - You know I 'll help you out. - For which I 'm grateful. But sooner or later, I 'll need to hear it. - Hear what? - The story of your life. And quite a tale it is. Full of ribald adventures, beautiful damsels with loose morals. Doyle. I will. Just give me time. The past do n't let go, does she? She never does. God, Aura, I ca n't believe I 've missed your calls. It 's that incompetent girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new apartment, for one thing. Celebrities are on top of me. Steve Paymer, that 's Dave Paymer 's brother, lives right down the hall. You 'd know him if you saw him. And my view, it 's amazing. Yeah, I have a roommate. But I never see him. Hey, hey, Phantom Dennis. Put that back. All in all, it 's working out great. Dennis, when I am on the phone, that 's quiet time. Thanks. Sorry. So where were we? Who 's wearing what in Sunnydale? No! Well, she never did have any taste. She 's so nasty,
