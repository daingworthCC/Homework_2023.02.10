Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " It must be this overarching commitment to what is really an abstraction, to one 's children right or wrong, that can be even more fierce than the commitment to them as explicit, difficult people, and that can consequently keep you devoted to them when as individuals they disappoint. On my part it was this broad covenant with children-in-theory that I may have failed to make and to which I was unable to resort when Kevin finally tested my maternal ties to a perfect mathematical limit on Thursday. I did n't vote for parties, but for candidates. My opinions were as ecumenical as my larder, then still chock full of salsa verde from Mexico City, anchovies from Barcelona, lime leaves from Bangkok. I had no problem with abortion but abhorred capital punishment, which I suppose meant that I embraced the sanctity of life only in grown-ups. My environmental habits were capricious ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after submitting to dozens of spit-in-the-air showers with derisory European water pressure, I would bask under a deluge of scalding water for half an hour. My closet wafter with Indian saris, Ghanaian wraparounds, and Vietnamese au dais. My vocabulary was peppered with imports -- gemutlich, scusa, hugge, mzungu. I so mixed and matched the planet that you sometimes worried I had no commitments to anything or anywhere, though you were wrong ; my commitments were simply far-flung and obscenely specific. <p> By the same token, I could not love a child ; I would have to love this one. I was connected to the world by a multitude of threads, you by a few sturdy guide ropes. It was the same with patriotism : You loved the idea of the United States so much more powerfully than the country itself, and it was thanks to your embrace of the American aspiration that you could overlook the fact that your fellow Yankee parents were lining up overnight outside FAO Schwartz with thermoses of chowder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwells the tawdry. In the conceptual dwells the grand, the transcendent, the everlasting.

You go to your little job or your little school, but you 're not going to hear about that on the 6:00 news, since guess what. Nothing is really happening. You read the paper, or if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is just the same as watching only even more boring. You watch TV all night, or maybe you go out so you can watch a movie, and maybe you 'll get a phone call so you can tell your friends what you 've been watching. And you know, it 's got so bad that I 've started to notice, the people on TV? Inside the TV? Half the time they 're watching TV. Or if you 've got some romance in a movie? What to they do but go to a movie? All those people, Marlin, " he invited the interviewer in with a nod. " What are they watching? " <p> " Had I catalogued the downsides of parenthood, " son might turn out to be a killer " would never have turned up on the list. Rather, it might have looked something like this : <p> 1. Hassle. 2. Less time just the two of us.( Try no time just the two of us. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballet teachers. The kid 's insufferable friends and their insufferable parents.) 4. Turing into a cow.( I was slight, and preferred to stay that way. My sister-in-law had developed bulging varicose veins in her legs during pregnancy that never retreated, and the prospect of calves branched in blue tree roots mortified me more than I could say. So I did n't say. I am vain, or once was, and one of my vanities was to feign that I was not.) 5. Unnatural altruism : being forced to make decisions in accordance with what was best for someone else.( I 'm a pig.) 6. Curtailment of my traveling.( Note curtailment. Not conclusion.) 7. Dementing boredom.( I found small children brutally dull. I did, even at the outset, admit this to myself.) 8. Worthless social life.( I had never had a decent conversation with a friend 's five-year-old in the room.) 9. Social demotion.( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tow, every man I knew--every woman, too, which is depressing--would take me less seriously.) 10. Paying the piper.( Parenthood repays a debt. But who wants to pay a debt she can escape? Apparently, the childless get away with something sneaky. Besides, what good is repaying a debt to the wrong party? Only the most warped mother would feel rewarded for her trouble by the fact that at last her is hideous, too.) "? Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " I never, ever took you for granted.

I wonder if company is n't more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk About Kevin <p> " It is n't very nice to admit, but domestic violence has its uses. So raw and unleashed, it tears away the veil of civilization that comes between us as much as it makes life possible. A poor substitute for the sort of passion we like to extol perhaps, but real love shares more in common with hatred does with geniality or politeness. "? Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " In truth we are bigger, greedier versions of the same eating, shitting, rutting ruck, hell-bent on disguising from somebody, if only from a three-year-old, that pretty much all we do is eat and shit and rut. The secret is there is no secret. that is what we really wish to keep fom our kids, and it the true collusion of adulthood... "? Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " Now that children do n't till your fields or take you in when you 're incontinent, there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the advent chooses to reproduce at all. "? Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " Tragedy seems to bring out all varieties of unexpected qualities in people. It was as if some folks got dunked in plastic, vacuum-sealed like backpacking dinners, and could do nothing but sweat in their private hell. And others seemed to have just the opposite problem, as if disaster had dipped them in acid instead, stripping off the outside layer of skin that once protected them from the slings and arrows of other people 's outrageous fortunes. For these sorts, just walking down the street in the wake of every stranger 's ill wind became an agony, an aching slog through this man 's fresh divorce and this woman 's throat cancer.

Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin <p> " These were good people and they had been good to us and we had therefore had a good time. To conclude otherwise was frightening, raising the specter of some unnameable quantity without which we could not abide, but which we could not summon on demand, least of all by proceeding in virtuous accordance with an established formula. <p> You regarded redemption as an act of will. You disparaged people( people like me) for their cussedly nonspecific dissatisfactions, because to fail to embrace the simple fineness of being alive betrayed a weakness of character. You always hated finicky eaters, hypochondriacs, and snobs who turned their noses up at Terms of Endearment just because it was popular. Nice eats, nice place, nice folks- what more could I possibly want? Besides, the good life does n't knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believed with sufficient industry that we had had a good time with Brian and Louise in theory, then we would have had a good time in fact. The only hint that in truth you 'd found laborous was that your enthusiasm was excessive. "?
