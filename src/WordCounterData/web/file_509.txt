5077741 <p> My husband and I are thinking about cashing out our self-directed IRA, paying the penalties, and investing in gold and silver coins. We figure the government is just going to eventually freeze or seize our IRA anyway, but do you have any suggestions on how we go about this? And does anyone have a good gold source for coins so we can use them for purchasing if it comes down to that? <p> Thanks. <p> Open to all suggestions please. We have nothing ready, not extra food, not water, not anything. <p> Thanks. <p> PS. Also my husband has a 401K at work that we ca n't touch, but would anyone recommend investing it in gold stock? <p> I would immediately get better prepared for economic collapse, which can happen suddenly. <p> Your priority should be food and water available for several months, and a year to be on the safer side. Next, comes protection in the form of guns and ammo and knowing how to use them. Last, comes wealth protection in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold it you do n't own it). <p> Topics on all of this have often been discussed on this site. Just use the search box up top. You can also feel free to start a thread asking for advice. Good luck! <p> P.S. for the 401K if it ca n't be touched then, yes, I would invest it in gold stock, just my own opinion, but I 'd get stock in gold miners. <p> Notice he said the economic collapse could come anytime including " starting tomorrow morning ". <p> In the new economy I believe people will return to using gold primarily for exchange as money. However, people will also use Bitcoin because it 's better suited for exchange, including online transactions. That will make bitcoins far more in demand than they are now. <p> I just thought we were trying to find a means of commerce that could n't be regulated or shut down by the feds when the economy collapses. So I guess I was looking more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or such. But how would you get them to your house anonymously was my musing... <p> the thing is no government can completely shut down barter between individuals. Some countries, for example, have large shadow economies where no taxes etc. are ever reported as individuals exchange goods/services by various means. <p> As far as shutting Bitcoin down, because of the way it works that 's not possible without shutting down the entire Internet. This makes Bitcoin more resistant to government tyranny than gold, for example, which can be and has been confiscated in the past. There are also ways to trade Bitcoin in person, with or without an Internet connection. <p> Monetary discussion has picked up in the last two or so year, has n't it? The subject of it is minerals as currency, but not any mineral and not just one. Rather, two metals are the subject but one of them talked about much more often than the other. <p> Who talks about this mineral? Not only Americans, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they? Might gold be the backing of currencies official used in transactions worldwide in the future, thereby establishing gold as the currency? Is n't the backing( of currency) what 's important when talking currency, anyway? If the value of the backing changes, however it 's achieved which should be known before entering its implementation because we do want to avoid dependency/forced togetherness again which would be on the scale worldwide, do n't we?), then what 's in front of it -- currency -- has to change, that is, the value of that currency has to change. But what happens if the currency does n't change when its backing 's value changes or, differently, if its backing changes? <p> Questions abound on gold as money. In these discussions, I 'm always at a loss why people pass, skip over, walk by, run over, the obvious, that the questions themselves necessitate collectivist thinking and doing, that gold would be the worldwide currency, the tethering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you Michael, I and every human would be transferring our use of a thing we did n't create but of which we used according to what pertains to us and us to it( the dollar for Americans) to what pertains to everyone everywhere and they to it, gold therefore the organizations comprising the structure supporting it. Those organizations are the centrality worldwide, the thing we 'd defer to in transactions. What Americans would be doing by using gold is moving out of one sphere, United States( therefore its sovereignty which consists of the US constitution), to the largest sphere, the world, thereby being participants of it. Force is how we are becoming participants. <p> So, for most people worldwide to use gold, its price and silver 's price will have to go down, down to prices affordable to most people. That aspect is absent in discussions of gold advocacy. What could offset a drastic fall in their prices is transition, which is what I think will happen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said there 'll be panic into gold. The panic would provoke surges, influxes, of people buying gold, holding onto gold and hording gold, a behavior anything but natural. What, people who buy gold today are better off than people who buy gold tomorrow is natural? *sigh* <p> Why, with all the commercials in our country and probably worldwide, it 's natural that people, even people who espouse freedom in body and in mind, do what they have been doing in more facets of their lives than not : follow the crowd, being a part( of a whole) instead of himself or herself, the whole. <p> The want for gold is unnatural. Gold -- or any currency that 's central -- is a massive psychology operation. Central currency is the leading component and concluding component of consolidating the last frontier, the world. Once consolidation is achieved, everyone except the " elite " are dependent on each other, a translation of us serving the elite, building their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt even one RP supporter wanted gold or even thought about gold before he learned about this issue, currency, concerning the United States and, consequently, concerning the world. <p> The promotion, belief and use of the mineral that humans named gold is a currency is a farce. <p> For those of us that did n't buy gold at $200... $500.... $1000 etc, have our savings in cash, are heavily invested in the stock / bond markets, and even have investments in real estate that was not purchased purchased decades ago, but rather after say... 2002... 03... 04... 05 levels, what do we do? <p> I fear holding cash that is devaluing, holding real estate that might crash further, being invested in a stock and bond bubble that is being propped up by the Fed and sideways micro trading, and buying gold at $1700 is all very scary. <p> I totally get your argument. So, what is your best guess as to what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock piling gold, then can it be possible that rather than use gold as the actual currency to be exchanged, why ca n't we have competing currencies that are backed by gold? How about competing currencies are reevaluated and based on each countries assets( precious metals, oil, land, agri-capacity, industrial capacity and education level etc...? <p> I want to retain what little wealth I have, but do n't know where to go. <p> I do not think that we all " collectively " will embrace gold as world currency, especially if it not readily available to an " average " person, nor silver, for that matter. <p> I think that we can all agree that what we need is competition in currency, let markets deside what is the most convenient form of money( hopefully real, but if some people insist on being paid in colorful or green paper, it 's their choice!). <p> It 's just historically that Au, Ag( and Cu for smaller transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing wrong in thinking that they can play that role again! But if everything else fails
