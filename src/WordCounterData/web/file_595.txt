The statement of the apostle here is, that his parents were led to preserve his life by their confidence in God. They believed that he was destined to some great purpose, and that he would be spared, notwithstanding all the probabilities against it, and all the difficulties in the case. <p> Was hid three months of his parents - By his parents. In Exodus 2:2, it is said that it was done " by his mother. " The truth doubtless was, that the mother was the agent in doing it - since the concealment, probably, could be better effected by one than where two were employed - but that the father also concurred in it is morally certain. The concealment was, at first, probably in their own house. The command seems to have been Exodus 1:22, that the child should be cast into the river as soon as born. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be found out by which his life might be spared. <p> Because they saw he was a proper child - A fair, or beautiful child -????????? asteion.

In Acts 7:20, it is said that he was " fair to God, "( Margin,) ; that is, exceedingly fair, or very handsome. His extraordinary beauty seems to have been the reason which particularly influenced his parents to attempt to preserve him. It is not impossible that they supposed that his uncommon beauty indicated that he was destined to some important service in life, and that they were on that account the more anxious to save him. <p> And they were not afraid of the king 's commandment - Requiring that all male children should be given up to be thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed, or did not so dread the king, as to be induced to comply with the command.

We know that Moses was bred up at the Egyptian court, and there was considered to be the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ; and probably might have succeeded to the throne of Egypt : but, finding that God had visited his people, and given them a promise of spiritual and eternal blessings, he chose rather to take the lot of this people, i.e. God as his portion for ever, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin, which, however gratifying to the, could only be??????????, temporary. <p> After the 23d verse, there is a whole clause added by DE, two copies of the Itala, and some copies of the Vulgate.

Which is to be understood, not of the faith of Moses, but of the faith of his parents, at the time of his birth ; which was when Pharaoh had published an edict, ordering every male child to be cast into the river ; but instead of obeying this order, Moses was hid three months of his parents ; that is, in his father 's house, as it is said in Acts 7:20 and is here expressed in the Ethiopic version. According to the Targumist( k), his mother went with him but six months, at the end of which he was born, and that she hid him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in which a woman usually goes with child ; and after that she could conceal him no longer : the hiding of him is here ascribed to both his parents, though in Exodus 2:2 it is represented as the act of his mother ; which, no doubt, was done, with the knowledge, advice, and consent of his father ; and the Septuagint there renders it, " they hid him " ; though the order of the history makes it necessary that it should be read in the singular. Parents ought to take care of their children ; and persons may lawfully hide themselves, or others, from the cruelty of tyrants, and that as long as they can, for their safety ; and this was so far from being wrong in the parents of Moses, that it is commended, as an instance of faith : they believed the promise in general, that God would deliver the people of Israel ; they believed this to be about the time of their deliverance, and had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliverer, because they saw he was a proper child ; not only of a goodly and beautiful countenance, but that he was peculiarly grateful and acceptable to God ; they perceived something remarkable in him, which to them was a token that he would be the deliverer of God 's people, and therefore they hid him ; See Gill on Acts 7:20. <p> And they were not afraid of the king 's commandment ; nor did they observe it, for it was contrary to nature, and to the laws of God, and to the promise of God 's multiplying of that people, and to their hopes of deliverance : there is a great deal of courage and boldness in faith ; and though faith may be weakened, it can not be lost ; and a weak faith is taken notice of, as here ; for though they feared not at first, they seem to be afraid afterwards ; but when God designs to work deliverance, nothing shall prevent. <p> Lit. by his fathers.
