5028441 <p> Meet Araki Setsuko, the class representative who always gets the top marks for every exam. Except now. When a low life in her class named Ryusaki Kohei achieves the top score in their English exam, she is furious and promises that she will beat him. <p> Meet Araki Setsuko, but you can just call her Setsuko. I 'm sure she wo n't mind. She 's fifteen, almost sixteen, in her second year of high school, and is the class representative. She always scores the top marks in every exam. <p> Except this time. <p> She stared at the board, her mouth in a gaping ' o ' shape as she did a double take. There was no way that she, Araki Setsuko, had come in at second place. She snapped out of her trance and looked up at first place. <p> " Eeeeeeeh? " she screamed, making the people near her cover their ears. <p> Ryusaki Kohei was never someone that Setsuko associated with. He was lazy, egotistical, and just an overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sure he knew as much. <p> She stormed into class, passing her three best friends in the process. They had all seen the leader board and knew instantly what this was about. All they could do was watch as Setsuko grabbed Kohei by the tie and dragged him down to her eye level. The boy 's friends were too shocked to do anything, but he seemed to be expecting this. <p> " What the hell, Ryusaki? " she demanded, but the boy 's smile did n't waver. <p> " Are you mad? " Kohei asked, now smirking. <p> Setsuko screamed right into his ear, a deafening sound that made him wince. She did n't reply to the question, instead storming over to her desk and sitting down. She slammed her head down on the desk as her friends approached her. <p> The two girls on either side of Emiko, Egami Ritsuka and Kasai Mayumi, nudged her in her side. She folded her arms over her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on Setsuko 's desk and said, " Look, it 's not the end of the world, you know. All you need to do is study harder for next time. You can beat him and you know it. " <p> There was a muffled groan from the desk. <p> The three friends looked at each other and shrugged as the bell rang for school to start. As the teacher walked in, Setsuko perked up, ready to listen. She scribbled down notes even when they were told they did n't have to. This was a habit that she had developed from an early age and was why she was so successful when it came to her schooling. Some people found this behaviour to be unnecessary or stupid, but she thought it was the complete opposite of that. She would have thought everyone would have figured that out after she scored so well in her first exams the previous year, but they had not. <p> As she turned her notebook to another page, something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She frowned and opened it, seeing a message written inside. <p> You never answered my question. Are you mad? -- Ryusaki Kohei <p> Setsuko scrunched the paper into a ball and pushed it into her pencil case. She looked over to the other side of the room and saw Kohei watching her from his seat by the window. When he saw her look away, he turned back to the board and did n't bother her for the rest of the lesson. <p> When their first recess break finally came, Kohei and his friends sauntered over to her and she hung her head. She was n't in the mood for anything they had to say, but apparently it was n't enough to keep him away. <p> " What is it? " she said, scowling. <p> Kohei pointed to the scrunched up piece of paper in her pencil case. " You never replied. " <p> She sighed and said, " Yes, I 'm angry, alright? Happy now? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I hate it when people are angry with me. " <p> Setsuko contemplated throwing her pencil case at him. She was in the middle of thinking about the consequences when Mayumi came up to them. She glared at the group of boys, and while Kohei felt the power from her stare, it was n't directed at him. <p> " Tsubasa, what the hell are you doing here? " she asked. " I thought I told you not to talk to my friends. " <p> Tsubasa was Mayumi 's twin brother, and most people could tell right away from their blue hair, body structure, and athletic ability. They did n't speak much in class, but they were close nonetheless. No one was ever to say so, otherwise the siblings would deny it. <p> Holding his hands up as if surrendering, Tsubasa said, " Hey, hey, enough of that, sis. I was n't talking to Araki. Only Kohei was. " <p> Ritsuka was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mayumi were practically inseparable, being childhood friends and all. She greeted Tsubasa with a wave and a small " Hello ", making Mayumi roll her eyes. <p> " See, I can talk Ritsu-chan. She wants to talk to me, " he said. <p> Mayumi muttered, " Whatever, " making Ritsuka giggle. <p> While Tsubasa and the two girls were conversing, Setsuko took the opportunity to stand up and leave. She had only just tucked her chair under her desk when she was noticed by Kohei. <p> " Do n't think you 're going to get away so easily, " he said, yanking her orange ponytail and making her shout. He said to his friends, " I 'm gon na talk to this one out in the corridor. See ya in a bit. " <p> He continued to pull Setsuko by her ponytail until they were in a deserted part of the hallway. Setsuko wondered how this boy could be so rough with a girl that was furious with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now, Ryusaki? " she said, tapping her foot to show her impatience. <p> " Look, I do n't know why you 're so angry about just one test, but what can I do to make it up to you? " Kohei asked. <p> Setsuko winced at the words " just one test ". Every test was an important test to her, so she needed to get the top marks for every single one. That 's how it worked in her world, and if he did n't respect that, she would just have to make sure he did n't bother her anymore. <p> " You can make it up to me by leaving me alone, " she said, giving him one last dirty look before stepping back into class. This time he did n't follow her or yank her ponytail, which she was grateful for. At least the guy knew when to stop. <p> The only people around her desk now were Mayumi, Ritsuka, and Tsubasa. Mayumi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and Ritsuka laughed. The image did n't really look right, especially without Emiko, who was sound asleep at her desk. <p> " So what did Kohei want? " Tsubasa asked when she sat back down. <p> Setsuko shrugged. " He wanted to make it up to me, but I told him to leave me alone. " <p> Tsubasa cracked up laughing, leaning on Ritsuka and Mayumi for support. " Seriously? I 've never heard of him doing something like that before. Besides, he 's probably never been shot down by a girl before. " <p> Setsuko thought about that. She had known ever since their first year that Kohei was somewhat of a ladies ' man, with his dark hair and perfect skin. Plus, he was tall but not too tall, a perfect height for girls who wanted their boyfriend to be taller. She did n't know why she as taking these things into consideration. She had never had a boyfriend before, and she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puberty. <p> " I did n't shoot him down, you know, " she said, folding her arms over her chest. " It 's just that he was bothering me, so I told him to leave. " <p> Tsubasa gave her a smile, though its meaning was hard to decipher. " Even so, all other girls would have taken advantage of the fact that he would make it up to them, probably asking him to date them. " <p> Mayumi raised an eyebrow. " And would he? " <p> " Probably not, " Tsubasa said. " See you. " And with that, he walked back to his desk. <p> As the bell rang, Kohei slipped back into the classroom. Instead of being disheartened like most people would be, he was smiling. He went back to his desk, risking a brief glance at Setsuko, who did n't see him. He smiled even wider as he sat down. <p> He whispered to himself, " Step @ @
