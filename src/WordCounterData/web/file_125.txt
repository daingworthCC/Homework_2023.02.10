5039041 <h> share this story <p> Last year, the president of the largest atheist organization in the United States spoke to a group of students organized for the 2011 Secular Student Alliance leadership conference. A focal point of his talk on the future of atheism was the idea of a " sleeping giant, " or what he called the " 30 percent under 30 " -- the nonreligious Americans who would shape the future of our national discourse on religion. <p> Though that figure was slightly off -- under the most recent survey figures available last year, 25 percent of Americans under 30 were religiously unaffiliated, and only about 7 percent of them identified as atheist or agnostic -- the statement was oddly prescient. This week, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released their most recent figures, revealing that the number of people who identify as religiously unaffiliated is growing rapidly -- particularly among people born in the 1980s and 1990s. So the nonreligious do indeed seem poised to assist in shaping the future of religious discourse, but perhaps not in the way some might have predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States have noted for several years now that the percentage of the American public that does n't affiliate with a religious tradition is growing at an astonishing rate, but even they may be surprised by Pew 's latest findings. The percentage of Americans with no religious preference, often referred to as the " nones, " has grown nearly 5 percentage points in the last five years to include about 1 in 5 Americans. For Americans under 30, the growth has been even more pronounced -- to nearly 1 in 3. <p> There are many possible reasons people might disaffiliate from religion. Some simply stop believing in religious claims -- sure enough, 12 percent of the " nones " identify as atheist and 17 percent identify as agnostic. But for many, their lack of religious affiliation may have more to do with identity politics than belief. In fact, the majority of the religiously unaffiliated seem to carry some beliefs associated with religious thinking. Sixty-eight percent of nonreligious Americans claim to believe in a god or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atheists and agnostics), and 40 percent pray at least once a month. Still, if we hope to understand this notable shift away from religion in American life, and where this growing demographic stands, we need to start including them in the conversation about religion and values. And that means believers and nonbelievers need to start paying attention. <p> In a time when debates about same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, capital punishment, epidemic hunger and even Big Bird dominate American discourse -- frequently bolstered by the language of " morality " and " values " -- it is of paramount importance that we understand the values held by the religiously unaffiliated. With an astonishing degree of ignorance about religious diversity in the United States, and a quickly emerging group with an ambiguous standing toward religion, the need for dialogue and education is only growing. As the number of religiously unaffiliated people climbs, and a younger generation becomes a more influential voice in society, it will become necessary to include and understand these voices in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly insightful, another way -- perhaps one of the best ways -- to better understand the " nones " is by directly engaging them in dialogue on the grassroots level. Over the last several years, the number of nonreligious people participating in interfaith dialogue has grown significantly ; the Secular Student Alliance reported that 1 in 5 of their college and university affiliate groups participated in interfaith programs in 2011, and Interfaith Youth Core consistently works with atheists, agnostics and the religiously unaffiliated. This trend must continue. Religious individuals and communities should be proactive about reaching out to the religiously unaffiliated, and inviting them to share their perspectives in a way that does n't patronize them or discount their experiences and ideas. The Pew study is perhaps one of the strongest indicators we 've seen that moving toward a more constructive dialogue between the religious and nonreligious is urgent. The religious and the religiously unaffiliated( including atheists and agnostics) surely share many common values, and now is the time to begin to identify them. <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forward by the Pew survey is n't entirely clear, and the " nones " seem to have a complicated relationship with organized religion. Though about 70 percent of them think religious organizations are too involved with money and politics, about 80 percent think that religious organizations help bring people together, build communities, and play an important role in helping the poor and those in need. To quote from Pew 's report : " a majority of the religiously unaffiliated clearly think that religion can be a force for good in society. " <p> These " nones " are n't likely to think that we 're a Christian nation, but they also are n't likely to think that churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and the like are obsolete. They recognize that religious communities and individuals are an active, relevant force in our society -- and often, an extremely positive one -- even if they do n't align themselves with a particular tradition. Because they seem unlikely to identify with the values or behaviors of religious fundamentalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voice feels like a new one. And in an age seemingly defined by polarization and tribalism, a potentially transformative one. <p> Alan Miller hopes for a humanist culture full of " inspiring alternatives " that " inspire and engage, " and in which people 's ethics and behaviors are built on, as he puts it, " something beyond themselves. " It seems to me that this will require making room for SBNRs. <p> Atheism+ is an exciting movement. I 'm looking forward to seeing it grow and evolve. We can use this opportunity to bridge divided worlds, build interfaith coalitions and make social justice campaigns stronger. <p> OK, church folks. Fasten your seatbelts. But do n't hunker down. There 's a new study out that shows that one in five Americans has no religious affiliation. Not Baptist, not Catholic, not Lutheran, not Jewish, not Muslim. <p> There is within this new emergence an affinity for those matters of social and personal justice, compassion, spiritual wholeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were the obsessions of Jesus while here on earth. <p> Selecting a superficial mixture of " nice-feeling " items from Yoga to a slice of Zen and a moment of Tao is hardly progressive as far as options for humanity is concerned. They have jettisoned the hard work, diligence and observation of organized religion for a me-me-me what-ever kind of lifestyle <p> Reflecting on the recent religiously rooted violence in Libya and Cairo, the Dalai Lama seems to be calling for a space of ethical and spiritual help us to keep this a safe and supportive place for writers of all ages to contribute. <p> As an atheist, I really appreciate the work you all are doing to bridge the gap between the religious and non-religious. We 'd all be a lot better off if we just treated each other like human beings and stopped worrying about what god a person does or does n't follow. Keep up the good work! <h> Loading comments... <p> " Religious individuals and communities should be proactive about reaching out to the religiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about atheists reach out to " religious individuals and communities " and let them know they can be good without superstition and that they can join a local secular group. <p> AndrewHall : " Religious individuals and communities should be proactive about reaching out <p> As for the 5 percentage point rise, we were referencing the rise in religiously unaffiliated in the last 5 years( from about 15 to about 20), not specifically atheists and agnostics. <p> We know it 's sometimes hard to keep these groups straight, but we tried to fact check all of our stats pretty thoroughly. <p> I was wrong, though, to claim American Atheists were the largest atheist organization in the U.S. ; it might be if we understood it pretty narrowly, but AA has membership in the low 4 figures or so, whereas say, FFRF has membership around 16,000. <p> hpbloggerVlad Chituc : Thanks for the comment, dschiff.

They 're not religiously unaffiliated in the larger sense( subscribing to no religious belief) but they 're unaffiliated within the scope of Christianity, usually referring to their church as " non-denominational ". <p> I 've often wondered if the popularity of these " mega " churches is a reflection of the desire to participate in some kind of faith/worship services but without the obligation to subscribe to specific creeds or policies. Perhaps it 's easier to stomach an hour or two of " God loves me and everyone " sung by a contemporary band than it is to sit through a berating " turn or burn " speech or squirming uncomfortably when the officiant insults their gay friends with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities could n't be described as agnostics or atheists, they are " unaffiliated " to a certain extent.

" <p> National discourse on religion? I was n't aware that we have one. What is this discourse supposed to accomplish? <p> " As the number of religiously unaffiliated people climbs, and a younger generation becomes a more influential voice in society, it will become necessary to include and understand these voices in our broader national discourse. " <p> Oh, I think I see. Let me guess... the people best able to lead that discourse, might they be " interfaith activists "? <p> See, I think Chris is wrong. It 's not going to be necessary to include those voices in our national dialog ; rather, it 's going to be impossible to EXclude them. They 're going to speak up and they 'll explain themselves -- we do n't need to hire spokesmen for them. <p> Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it seems pretty simple to me. Because you 're free to chose your religion, all its tenets are just your personal opinions. The statements, " In my opinion we should increase Welfare benefits " and " My faith tells me we should increase Welfare benefits " are identical. Anyone who pretends the latter deserves more weight than the former deserves scorn and ridicule. <p> And that 's where atheists come in. In growing numbers, we 're ridiculing the notion religious beliefs deserve more respect than any other opinion. And that 's the direction we 're pushing our " national discourse on religion. " The goal is a society where evidence, not creed, substantiates your opinions. <p> wbthacker : " nonreligious Americans who would shape the future of our national <h> Loading comments... <p> I hope you have read Marcel Gauchet 's THE DISENCHANTMENT OF THE WORLD. His interpretation of history in the West is that everything began to change around 1700, with the scientific revolution. Our governments began to play the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of identity from our national identity. As of 1800, religion 's hold on people gradually let go. No chance that will be reversed in the West. <p> However, substituting citizen identity for religious identity just presents the same problems in a different light. I have not studied " civil religion, " but it faces issues of nihilism and alienation, as can be seen with the rise in social conflicts. Insofar as secularism is understood in terms of religion, and it is, we have new wine in old wineskins. <p> Compare it to so-called " independent " voters, who do not depend on a political party for information but must rely on the mass media or special interest groups. Except for public broadcasting, the mass media is selling political information as well as commercial products. " Independent " voters are forced to decide whose lies to believe. So it is likewise with the religiously " unaffiliated. " Better referred to as " uninformed.

Our systems are crumbling. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tomorrow is to prepare ourselves for a likely long and painful period of human suffering on a scale we find unbearable. Even an abrupt change in the direction of caring for humans will not prevent the short-term suffering. <p> I do n't know if organized religion in the West is listening. Yes, the pope 's last encyclical called for social justice. But if it is government, rather than private religion and charities, that determines our lives, and if it is the people in democracy that govern, the evidence that we can learn from our mistakes is flimsy at best. We are in a new dark ages of global civil war. Sure, religion made lots of
