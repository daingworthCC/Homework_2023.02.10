5252141 <p> AMENA : Beauty is anything that reminds me of what 's good, right, loving &; true. Something that is a bass line. Sometimes it 's a conversation. Sometimes it 's seeing how a difficult experience changed someone 's life for the better. <p> CATALYST : How do you reconcile the tension of commercial viability( making a living from producing art) and your own artistic integrity? Or is there even a tension? <p> AMENA : I feel this tension sometimes when I am asked to write a piece for a particular event or organization according to their theme. The good thing is I am always writing things I agree with, but the tension comes in trying to fit certain messaging into the art of spoken word. It is a tender dance and takes a lot of prayer and drafting, plus communication with the team I 'm working with. <p> One thing I always have to work on as an artist is the discipline of just creating, whether I am working on a project or not. This way I keep the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various projects for work purposes. <p> AMENA : My creative process starts with music, preferably John Coltrane or Miles Davis. I almost always do a free write before I write anything else. The combination of the free write and the jazz gives me a chance to write unedited and with no end goal in mind except to get my words and thoughts flowing. One of my obstacles is the constant fear that something I 'm writing is n't good enough. This thought often keeps me from just sitting down to write versus coming up with all sorts of errands to run and items to clean! I find when I finally sit down to write, it 's a relief and I 'm glad to have at least started the process. <p> CATALYST : We are all " called " to be makers, according to the creation mandate in Genesis. What is the relationship between your art and your calling? How do you see yourself fulfilling your calling through your art? <p> AMENA : To me, art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do so He can shine through it. As long as I am using my words for good and living a life that matches those words, I feel like I will be fulfilling my calling and my art. <p> Love it. Thank you Amena. We too often see beauty in a utilitarian manner. Beauty exists in all its manifestations simply for its own sake ; it is God 's nature. I recall my first impressions of the Hubble space telescope photos. Some of the images were breathtakingly spectacular and I was caused to ponder, who are they beautiful for? No one sees them...... until now, of course. All those eons of time passed and the only one who sees them is God ; then I think, " Oh yes ". That 's it, and that 's enough. It 's about God. You and I are part of His created " beauty ". Each of us is creative..... and that 's beautiful. <p> Comment by Jesse - Oct 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of a one year old boy and, although I agree with the fact that flouride should be avoided, i think it 's a better to leave there decisions to the doctors and nurses wich are qualified to decide this. and i mean real doctors and nurses, even if we are talking about the ones that get their degree online. That does n't mean they
