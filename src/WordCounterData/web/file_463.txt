5073141 <h> Minnesota High School Cracks Down on Leggings, Yoga Pants <p> One high school is cracking down on the High school girls in Minnesota have been asked to dress a little more modestly after one principal noted that tight leggings and yoga pants are leaving too little to the imagination. <p> Minnetonka High School Principal David Adney emailed parents on Monday, asking them to talk to their daughters about wearing sheer leggings and curve-hugging yoga pants to school. In an interview with Yahoo! Shine, he was quick to say that his email was a request, not an ultimatum. <p> " This is not a ban on anything, " he told Yahoo! Shine. " We 're just trying to guide them to make better decisions for themselves. " <p> " We want them to strive for modesty, " he added. " We ca n't define modesty for every family, but we can ask them to make good decisions that reflect well on their families. " <p> Girls have been wearing yoga pants and leggings to school for years, Adney acknowledges, but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, jerseys, or long sweaters. " It 's a fashion trend that has existed for a while, but has accelerated, " he said. Now they 've been coming into school wearing shorter shirts, exposing their legs, backsides, and more. <p> " Not all leggings are created equal, " Adney pointed out, choosing his words carefully. " With Lyrca and Spandex, the definition can be severe, front and back. " <p> Complaints about the overexposure came from female staffers, volunteers, and even other students, Adney says, prompting him send out the email request. <p> " On things that are going on in school, we try to address the kids directly, to be proactive, " Adney said. " But with this, we did n't want to embarrass any girls, so we emailed the parents. " <p> While some students are upset about the issue -- " As long as they 're not see-through, they should be allowed, " freshman Carine Colwell told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked him for intervening. <p> " I 've received about 100 messages in 24 hours, and only two of them were negative, " he told Yahoo! Shine. " And those two said that it was highly sexist. "( Boys at the school have also had their fashion choices scrutinized, he points out. Last spring, Adney put out an alert about revealing muscle shirts ; this fall, he had to enforce a no-baseball-hat policy, and in years past baggy jeans have been a big issue -- just as they were when he became the principal more than 10 years ago.) <p> This is n't Adney 's first trend-related clash. In 2006, he gained national attention for cracking down on " grinding " -- ultra-dirty dirty dancing -- at Minnetonka High School, telling students that they should " dance like Grandma 's watching " instead. Even then, rather than preaching to the kids or forcing them to sign pledges, he collaborated with them to create a series of hilarious videos about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clothes, the Minnetonka High School handbook simply asks that clothing not be disruptive, offensive, or inappropriate. The goal is to instill in kids a set of high expectations, not to hound them with a set of fixed rules, Adney explained. <p> " It 's about creating a culture, " he said. If you build an environment where you outline expectations and encourage discussion, kids feel heard and respected. " It 's not a freakish control thing. " <p> The father of three grown daughters, Adney says he gets the girls ' desire to be fashionable. " We do n't want to be the clothes police, walking around with measuring devices, " he said. " But it 's not too much to ask you to keep your butts covered. " <p> When the camel toe is visible, it is time... long past time... to get more clothing on. There is NO FASHION that says leggings with nothing over the butt is attractive, sorry. What these girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police. <p> Kudos to him! Would have loved to have had him as a principal growing up. We had actual rules that were kept( i.e., we could n't wear shirts with less than 3 inches of material covering your shoulders if you were a female). This right here is an intelligent man who is simply ASKING for some modesty. I 'm sorry chitlins, but he 's right, not covering your a** while wearing leggings is just trashy. I do n't care if you have Miranda Kerr 's body ; it 's plain inappropriate. <p> I think what he 's asking is fair. He 's not asking them to stop wearing their leggings and yoga pants, just to wear them more modestly for the comfort of everyone in the school. If any of the students object then they 're probably being brought up as entitled dbags at home anyway. <p> MOST if not all of the females that I ahve seen in the ultra tight leggings with the camel-toe and the " horserear " look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ugly ladies! cover your junk!, the legging fashion calls for a longer tunic, sweather or shirt --- get with the program! <p> Have to agree with other posters, why are the parents of these girls letting them out of the house with such outfits? Too, as others have noted, leggings are meant to be worn with long sweaters, blouses, etc., NOT short tops. When you wear them with a short top you 're not making a fashion statement, you look like you forgot part of your clothing when you got dressed that day. Think " Wal Mart fashion photos! " <p> I do n't see anything wrong with what he asked. A lot of leggings are see through! So, it makes sense to wear something that covers the bottom region. I personally never wear leggings without a dress over... <p> More principals need to be like this guy! I 'm not a mom but I 'm an older sister and I hated dropping her off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bend over to pick something up and show more then what needs to be shown. <p> Teens need guidence, where are the parents, are you afraid to talk to you young adults about ANYTHING??? Pants hanging down, leggings, a whole lot of cleavage showing on teen girls, fake nails, weaves, texting while driving. Parents you 've sold your
