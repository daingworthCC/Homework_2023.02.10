5251441 <h> Information Tools <h> Workforce Quality <p> Overall, Virginia boasts one of the best-educated and most productive workforces in the country. It employs a higher percentage of people in science and engineering than any other state in the nation, and has been successful both in providing higher education opportunities to its population and in attracting highly educated workers from other states. However, regional educational attainment varies considerably, suggesting that weaknesses exist. <h> Why is This Important? <p> Workforce quality is closely tied to labor productivity, making it a key determinant of economic growth and wages. In today 's dynamic economy, jobs increasingly require education beyond a high school diploma. Education not only prepares individuals for the tasks required by a job, but also enhances an individual 's ability to adapt to new working environments. <p> In recent years, knowledge-intensive industries have become a key contributor to the growth of the national economy and to U.S. exports abroad. Skilled workers in knowledge-intensive industries generally experience lower rates of unemployment and faster wage growth than those in other sectors. <h> How is Virginia Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's workforce. One view presents a remarkably well-educated labor force with a significant number of advanced degree holders. The other shows a low level of educational attainment among large segments of the population in some geographic areas. <h> Educational Attainment <p> Virginia has an impressively high percentage of skilled workers, reflecting the state 's large knowledge-intensive sector. Virginia ranked first in the nation in the percentage of its workforce( 6.6 percent) in science and engineering( S &E); occupations for 2010. Maryland 's percentage of workers in S &E; was 6.0 percent, while North Carolina( 3.8%) and Tennessee( 2.6%) were lower than the national average of 4.0 percent. <p> The percentage of Virginia 's workforce with advanced degrees also demonstrates Virginia 's commitment to education, as well as its ability to attract educated workers. In 2011, Virginia ranked fourth in the nation for the most master 's degrees( 10.6%), fifth for the most professional degrees( 2.5%), and eighth for doctorates( 1.5%) as a percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the population had a master 's degree, 1.9 percent had a professional degree, and 1.2 percent a doctorate degree. <p> In comparing Virginia to its peers, Maryland ranked higher than Virginia in all three degrees, with 11.2 percent having master 's degrees, 2.8 percent professional degrees, and 2.4 percent doctorate degrees. Virginia, however, ranked above both North Carolina( 6.5% master 's degrees, 1.5% professional degrees and 1.1% doctorate degrees) and Tennessee( 5.6% master 's degrees, 1.5% professional degrees and 1.2% doctorate degrees). Massachusetts led the U.S. nationally in master 's degrees( 11.7%) and tied with Maryland in doctorate degrees( 2.4%) ; Maryland led the U.S. in professional degrees( 2.8%). <h> Worker Productivity <p> Worker productivity, defined as output per worker, is an alternate measure of workforce quality. Unlike educational attainment, which captures the inputs into workforce quality, worker productivity measures the average output of workers. High labor productivity typically results in higher standards of living. <p> Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when the state started growing more rapidly. In 2010, Virginia 's output-per-worker value -- $79,896 -- was higher than the national average of $75,393( adjusted in year 2005 dollars ; see Data Sources note). Virginia ranked 11th among all the states, an improvement from 13th in 2001. Maryland( $78,706), North Carolina( $73,222), and Tennessee( $64,588) all had a lower rate of productivity than Virginia. Delaware( $106,087) was again the leading state in worker productivity in 2010. <p> These achievements in workforce quality, however, mask a weakness in Virginia 's labor market. In 2011, 12.2 percent of Virginia adults lacked a high school diploma -- the 24th highest among the 50 states. Montana had the lowest at 7.7 percent. The percentage of Virginia 's population without a diploma was lower than North Carolina( 15.3%) and Tennessee( 15.8%), but higher than Maryland( 11.1%). The national average was 14.1 percent. <p> Within Virginia, rural regions have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious impediment to economic growth. In 2006-2010, the percentage of adults with less than a high school diploma was nearly 26 percent in the Southside and Southwest regions and above 18 percent in the Eastern and Valley regions. However, these represent significant improvements over 2000, when more than 34 percent of Southside and Southwest region residents 25 years and older were without a high school diploma. In the Eastern and Valley regions, over 24 percent did not have a diploma. <h> What Influences Workforce Quality? <p> The existence of a skilled workforce is an indicator of both the presence of industries that need them and a measure of a state 's ability to educate or attract skilled workers. Thus, workforce quality can be improved both by investing in education and by creating a business-friendly environment that attracts knowledge-intensive businesses and the skilled workforce that these businesses employ. <p> Looked at another way, low educational attainment reflects in part the lower number of high quality employment opportunities in some regions of the state. Without employers who value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education. Those who do obtain more education often migrate to higher-employment regions. <h> What is the State 's Role? <p> States can create a high quality workforce by investing in education and skill training and creating educational and workforce systems that can adapt quickly to new skill requirements demanded by the market. Virginia 's greatest contribution to workforce readiness is in the 50,000 degrees that are produced in its public colleges and universities every year. In addition to this, over 46,000 career readiness certificates, which certify individual employability skills, have been awarded by community colleges and one-stop employment centers since the program began in 2004. <p> Virginia is also working to retrain workers through its Workforce Investment Act( WIA) program, which assists older youth, adults, and dislocated workers in finding and keeping new jobs. <p> States can also indirectly improve their workforce quality by promoting an environment that attracts knowledge-intensive businesses. Once these businesses enter the market, they will then demand skilled workers, which in turn will induce more individuals to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other states. <p> S &E; occupations are defined by 77 standard occupational codes that encompass mathematical, computer, life, physical, and social scientists ; engineers ; and post-secondary teachers in any of these S &E; fields. People with job titles such as manager are excluded. Because of this difference and the sample-based nature of the data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise. <p> Note : The District of Columbia has been omitted from the chart. The District of Columbia is an outlier with 21.59 percent in S &E; occupations, but this is partly due to a high percentage of people working in or with the federal government. <p> Less than High School Diploma -- U.S. Census, Educational Attainment 2000 and American Community Survey 2011 ; 2006-2010 regional figures are based on American Community Survey 5-year estimates between January 2006 and December 2010. http : //factfinder2.census.gov( updated annually in December) <p> Worker Productivity -- Calculations based on gross domestic product and employment data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 chained dollars.

Virginia overall has an impressive number of highly skilled and educated workers -- but also a relatively high percentage of adults who lack a high school diploma.
