It 's definitely not as low as $600 but it 's probably not also as high as $4000( at least for electrc guitars. Acoustics and archtops are a different world). Whatever that number is, it comes about as a result of efficiency in production and by definition that also means limiting alternative features which would be less efficient to produce. So wile the quality of construction and components may be maximized, the number of choices becomes limited. <p> Exactly. From what i 've seen, fender, PRS, ibanez-cort-yamaha, etc can produce high quality electric and acoustic guitars around the 800$ price( or even 600$), with a perfect finish, hardware en electronics. A guitar is not a rocket science issue. So you can get a high quality guitar under the 1000$ price tag. <p> So, if you pay a lot more money for a guitar, you should n't be getting better quality, you should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less efficient to produce.

Definitely. <p> In the same class as the well/best made $1800-2500 guitars I 've seen on comparable platforms/styles? No. <p> Of course, these I 'm thinking of are also often superior to major name custom shop guits that cost as much or more. <p> Exactly.

The quality is based upon his genius in design and talent. The playability and especially the sound represent a new watermark. The artwork side( some are actually plain) is an independent plus. <p> I assumed we were discussing more boutique builders - their " quality " in general is very high. <p> Some builders do n't want to build the lowest priced guitars they can. Some want to live in the good ' ol USA, provide health insurance to their employees, and go on a two week vacation every year( GRIN - sounds goo to me!) All that stuff costs money - which is got through higher prices. <p> Oh yea, boutique guitars generally are( and have to be) high quality guitars. Nobody here said the opposite. What 's the difference between a 2800$ MJ Mirage Standard guitar and a 7000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very honest about the Old America issue, special features, artwork, exotic woods, what the builder thinks worths it, etc. That 's beyond the mere quality property of a guitar. It has more to do with the quality of that special feature, quality of living for the worker, quality of the artwork and design, exquisite wood, etc that is beyond the quality guitar itself that have as purpose playing notes well. For most ears, for your fingers and in the other side of the speaker, most of those issues do n't matter at all. It is a guitar! <p> Let me just state that finding the right builder( one that really knows the ins and outs of guitar building and one that understands the needs of each buyer) is a huge part of the deal. <p> I 've purchased guitars from a highly regarded artistic guitar builder, but I have issues with each one of them that I feel certainly should not exist at their price point. I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great price), but the fit is n't right( although I 'm trying to get used to it). My USA Swamp Ash Strat with Kinman pickups is very nice, but in my studio, it 's noisy.( It 's not noisy in places with better electrical wiring, no dimmers, etc.) Neck size and shape are huge for me, and noise issues can be at least mostly solved with the GuitarNuts.com shielding and grounding method. So, what to do? Well, in true TGP fashion, I 'll most likely list them here for a good price so they can find the right home. Or maybe not... <p> In lesser inexpensive " price point " guitars you will not see items such as strategically placed carbon fiber reinforcement rods in the neck, custom carved necks, the best quality hardware and electronics &; master grade fingerboard woods and a very refined process as to installation of the frets and neck. All of these translate to an instrument that requires considerably less maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a definite guess that those who do n't see the differences are playing with a lot of gain and distortion. In this context it does n't make much difference at least sound wise because the audio playback controls almost all the sound. <p> I have a definite guess that those who do n't see the differences are playing with a lot of gain and distortion. <p> I would guess that you are mostly wrong about that. My guess is that those who do n't see the difference would represent a large spectrum of playing styles, tonal characteristics and skill levels. There are lots of players( including some who are very skilled) who just do n't worry too much about the fine details of their instrument. <p> I have a definite guess that those who do n't see the differences are playing with a lot of gain and distortion. In this context it does n't make much difference at least sound wise because the audio playback controls almost all the sound. <p> 1) You need to compare guitars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no point comparing a Strat to an Archtop). The cost of goods, amount of time and skills required will vary all over the place. <p> 2) it is very rare to find two guitar players who agree upon what is best in an instrument( e.g. What is great to one player can be crap to another). So twice as good to one player is not to another. <p> 3) Some boutique guitars are made by shops within large corporations, some by small team based shops and others by individuals. The cost structure and level of supply chain integration varies greatly, and hence pricing. <p> 4) Like any product or service price/value proposition does not escalate linearly but begins to flatten out beyond a certain point. The point where the curves flatten differ based on the style/class of guitar. <p> 5) People pay for customization, detail and uniqueness when going boutique vs. paying for brand equity and resale when going with higher end brand names. <p> my $.02 <p> Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to another thread comparing Epiphones and Gibsons, which basically concluded you can find a good Epiphone that can keep up with a Gibson for much cheaper, and this is true for Fender or whatever as well. <p> This got me thinking about boutique guitars. It 's all based on preference, but would a $7000-10,000 hand made boutique guitar be twice as good as a $3500-4000 handmade boutique guitar? At what point are you just paying for different customization and the perceived quality difference goes out the door completely? Nobody NEEDS a $7,000+ guitar, but is someone missing out if they never play one? <p> For instance, my main guitar( MJ Mirage Standard) is $2800 brand new( though I bought it used), and to me it 's the best playing and sounding guitar I 've ever played, with another guitar coming very close( Anderson Cobra, around the same price new). I 'm not a fan of how most PRS guitars play and sound, regardless of price. I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. would be that much better, or just " different. " <p> I agree with Jim S that many players do not pay attention to the finer details. However, most advanced players do not use price point instruments unless they have a manufacturer 's endorsement. <p> Lesser expensive guitars are not " hand-made ". In fact, the substantial reliance upon machinery, especially CNC and robotic finishing are responsible for the relatively impressive quality of these instruments. Also, certainly not to be derogatory but, if you look at Taylor 's production facility it 's pretty hard to say that their instruments are not " made by robots ". The human involvement is relatively minimal. I also firmly believe this is why they make excellent but not the best instruments. <p> Which is to say, part of being a guitar player is to figure out your own answers. <p> While it 's objectively true that there is no definable linear correlation between price and quality, that does n't mean that no expensive guitar is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always find an inexpensive guitar that will get the job done. <p> Another truth : your understanding/opinion is only valid for you. Just because you believe that you can find a bitchen ' Epiphone that you think is just as good as someone else 's vintage Les Paul does n't mean that that viewpoint is true or correct in general or for anyone else.( if it 's correct for you, consider yourself lucky, in a way) Just because you can find a bunch of people to affirm your belief on a thread like this does n't mean it 's objectively true. <p> Yet another truth : there are some guitar builders who are simply better than others. That 's part of why some builders command a premium for their work. Of course not every builder who commands a premium is in fact better, but part of the learning curve for guitar players who take the instrument, as an instrument, seriously is to learn to tell the difference between " truly better " and " flavor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what you need in order to express what it is you want to express. <p> In my experience, the best guitarists generally learn to evaluate guitars( and gear) independently of cost. In my opinion, in forums such as this, way too much attention and energy is expended on the whole cost/money side of it. <p> Sound - confidence that in your estimation, the Luthier is capable of choosing and marrying the tone woods with the Pickups, electrolytics, wiring etc... to achieve the tone in your head. <p> Perhaps most important, being able to collaborate with a dedicated individual who cares enough about his/her craft and is skilled enough to be able to synthesize your spec into a finished product that is ultimately satisfying to you. The fact that another individual might not care for the result is unimportant <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by naveed211 <p> At what point are you just paying for different customization and the perceived quality difference goes out the door completely? Nobody NEEDS a $7,000+ guitar, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? <p> Customization and skill behind the execution are huge. Forget about vintage as they are overpriced for the purposes of this discussion but see if you can sniff out a recent example of a Huber or McInturff and judge for yourself. Your opinion is the only important opinion. <p> Quote : <p> Originally Posted by naveed211 <p> I 'd wonder if a $7000 Nik Huber or $5000 McInturff etc. etc. would be that much better, or just " different.

If you lack that level of understanding, than it would probably just be different... and someone just playing the guitar might not appreciate the difference... but then again they might. <p> And any in hand comparison btwn a $300-$600 strat or other and a Suhr( let alone
