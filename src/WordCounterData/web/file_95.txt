5036041 <h> The best... <p> The best type without budget constraint will be LCD flat screen. <p> LCD or DLP rear projection HDTVs are the cheapest, and the bigger the size is, the larger the price difference. Their picture quality is not as good as the other types, and they are heavier and bulkier, although they have slimmed down quite a bit these days, and if you want to wall mount them, good luck... : -) <p> Their light bulb will have to replaced soon or later depending on your usage, so this is a put-off too. <p> Plasma TVs still can not solve the issue of burn-in, although a problem that is a bit exaggerated. If you watch heavily 4:3 pictures, you should be concerned. Their screens are too refective, making them appropriate for darker rooms only, although Panasonic does have new models with special coating to deal with this. They also get quite hot. <p> LCD flat screen HDTVs do n't have any of these problems above, and their picture qualtiy has improved a lot. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Toshiba and even Samsung come close to plasma, if not better. <p> Of course, they cost the most. Although, some value brands such as Vizio and Westinghouse have much lower prices, but their picture quality is not comparable, and their reliability is not conclusive. <p> &gt;&gt; Where to buy Best 46-inch LCD HDTV.

While the monitor does not deliver the same rich blacks as plasma TVs, it does a better job than many LCD TVs, and its bright images are a good choice for well-lit rooms. In addition, thanks to its 1080p resolution, it delivers far more HD details than similarly sized 720p plasma displays. However, there are no tuners at all, which means that the monitor is best for those who get all of their programming through a cable box or satellite receiver( which serves as the tuner).( compare prices) Sony BRAVIA KDL-40XBR2( *est. $2,390) <p> &gt;&gt; Where to buy Best 40-inch LCD HDTV.

And critics say the Olevia 537H outperforms most other LCD TVs in its size and price class when it comes to image quality. Black levels are better than with many LCD TVs, though not as good as LCD TVs from Sony or JVC. Some say the menu system is confusing to use, and the TV is otherwise feature-light.

This Sony TV is one of the few currently available small-screen LCD TVs with a digital tuner. That means it wo n't become obsolete when analog broadcasting ends in early 2009.

Though all experts say the Vizio P50 ca n't equal the superior performance of a Pioneer or Panasonic plasma TV, the Vizio P50 is an excellent budget pick for those who do n't need the best possible picture quality. Experts say the picture will likely need some adjustment out of the box. Critics add that this plasma television actually outperforms many higher-rated TVs in displaying standard definition TV signals.( compare prices) Pioneer PDP-5070HD( *est. $2,600) Pioneer PDP-5070HD &gt;&gt; Where to buy Best 50-inch plasma HDTV.

Since it is a monitor and not a true TV, however, the Panasonic TH-50PH9UK has no speakers, no table stand or wall mount, and it offers minimal connections -- even an HDMI input is an extra-cost option. Because this monitor has no tuners, it is best for those who will use separate speakers and get all of their TV from cable or satellite.

If price is n't an object, critics are simply floored by the image quality of this 50-inch 1080p HD monitor from Pioneer. While this resolution is new in plasma TVs, it 's the plasma TV to get if you want the very highest of high-def. The PRO-FHD1 has lots of picture controls and display modes, but it 's a plasma monitor -- that means it has no turners, no speakers and no included stand. This makes the Pioneer Elite only appropriate for cable and satellite subscribers who want to use separate speakers and do n't mind paying extra for a stand or wall-mount hardware.( compare prices) &gt;&gt; Comparison Chart <p> Sony Grand WEGA KDS-60A2020( *est. $2,500) <p> &gt;&gt; Where to buy 60-inch LCoS HDTV.

Now, there are all sorts of questions. Do you go wide or not? Is LCD better than plasma? And what 's the difference between rear-projection LCD, LCoS, and DLP HDTVs? If all the tech jargon has you confused, do n't worry. Read our guide to the pros and cons of high-tech TVs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hit your local electronics store. <p> Direct-view( tube) TVs Upside : Downside : Forecast : Relatively inexpensive ; can produce deep black levels ; wide viewing angle. Bulky and heavy ; limited screen size ; lower resolution ; usually not PC-compatible. These sets are still going strong, and their low prices will keep them around in smaller screen sizes for years to come. <p> Sony 's 34-inch KD-34XBR960 direct-view tube TV weighs 196 pounds.Direct view is how industry insiders refer to any television that does n't use projection technology. Many of them are the familiar tube TVs you see everywhere--they 're called tubes because the glass forms the business end of a cathode-ray tube( CRT). Direct-view tube TVs can be found in sizes up to 36 inches( diagonal), and as their screen sizes increase, so do their heft and depth. Sony 's 34-inch KD-34XBR960, for example, tips the scales at nearly 200 pounds, measures 24 inches deep, and requires a minimum of two--and probably three--burly guys to lift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it does n't pay for companies to make larger tube TVs ; they simply are n't practical. <p> High-end tube TVs can give a great-looking picture. CRTs are still the kings of black level, a term used to describe the quality and the depth of black, the darker the better. Direct-view tube sets look good from any angle, so unlike flat-panel LCDs and rear-projection sets, the picture quality does n't change depending on where you sit. Compared with newer TV technologies, however, direct-view sets often look softer with high-definition material because they ca n't deliver as much detail. Most tubes wo n't accept high-resolution PC sources. Also, tubes suffer from more geometry errors than do flat-panel sets, which can make straight vertical and horizontal lines appear to bend onscreen. <p> New developments Flat vs. curved screens : The traditional curved shape of the glass tube is giving way to completely flat glass. Sony introduced flat tubes first with its Wega televisions, but now, just about every manufacturer sells some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech, it collects less ambient light from the room and, therefore, helps to reduce glare. But it 's a myth that flat tubes result in straighter lines ; they can have the same geometry problems as their curved counterparts, especially near the corners and the edges of the screen. <p> Digital vs. analog : Many tubes are still entirely analog, meaning that they wo n't work with high-definition tuners or progressive-scan DVD players. An increasing number of direct-view tube TVs, however, can display high-definition sources. These sets still use the tube, an inherently analog display technology( unlike plasma, LCD, DLP, and the rest ; see the following sections), but if they can accept and display high-definition and progressive-scan images, they qualify as honest-to-goodness HDTVs. <p> Wide-screen 16:9 vs. standard-screen 4:3 : For the strongest theatrical impact, the majority of movies and HDTV shows are filmed in the wide-screen format, where the screen is much wider than it is tall. Regular televisions and most standard-definition TV programs use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the screen compared to its height. Newer TVs--especially HDTVs--almost always have screens with a much wider ratio : 16 units of width for every 9 units of height, which translates to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Wide-screen, direct-view TVs cost more than 4:3 models for the same amount of screen real estate, but they 're great if you watch a lot of DVDs or HDTV. <p> Thin tubes : Some TV makers are coming out with so-called thinner tubes that are much shallower than standard tubes of the same size. Samsung 's TX-R3093WH is a good example : its depth measures just 16 inches, which is about 6 inches shallower than a typical 30-inch wide-screen tube TV. While that depth is definitely thinner than usual, it 's certainly not flat. <h> There really is no best yet <p> It is boiling down to opinion, but there are some things to consider : There are other posts with the same question, the black level should be black not grey, a very high contrast ratio is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or picture quality, all are bad for the environment, a glass screen cover is easiest to clean versus lcd, you do n't really care that the programs are still being made for older crt and the resolution is n't as good as a crt yet.
