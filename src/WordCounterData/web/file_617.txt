5088641 <p> Joe Biden today admitted that, at this point, he believes Hillary Clinton might have been a better Vice Presidential choice than him. Of course, this was not exactly a welcome comment by the Obama campaign which seems to be struggling to find a footing this month. <p> At a rally in Nashua, New Hampshire, a man in the audience told Biden how glad he was that Obama picked him over Hillary " not because she 's a woman, but because look at the things she did in the past. " <p> " Make no mistake about this, " Biden responded. " Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America. LetTs get that straight. SheTs a truly close personal friend, she is qualified to be president of the United States of America, sheTs easily qualified to be vice president of the United States of America and quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me. But sheTs first rate, I mean that sincerely, sheTs first rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Porritt offered this response from the McCain camp : " Barack ObamaTs most important decision of this election and Biden -- the candidate he selects -- suggests himself that he wasnTt the right man for the job and that Hillary Clinton would have been a better choice. Biden certainly has a credible viewpoint on this. " <p> Talk about a gaffe! It seems that Biden said something which I 'm betting a lot of Democrats are also feeling. Perhaps not even because of Sarah Palin, however, just for the fact that choosing Hillary Clinton would have done a lot to unite the Democratic Party and excite their base. <p> I have not seen the Obama campaign 's response on this and will post one if I find it. <p> Note : The comments section below contains opinions and views from the online community at YouDecidePolitics.com, read at your own risk!

Be respectful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden : Hillary Clinton " might have been a better pick " " <p> Nate, what do you think about revamping this site after the election so we can keep discussing current events? I think that would be a great thing to do, because I had a very hard time finding a respectful forum where people from all political vantage points could discuss the news( which has been mainly election-oriented for a while). <p> I think it 's amusing that even though Ron Paul would never endorse McCain, as a matter of principle, he chose to focus on how it would make him " unpopular ". It 's especially funny since no one who challenges the establishment is what you 'd call " popular "! <p> I actually have another domain registered with some plans for continuing the site after the election. It will be in the works as YouDecidePolitics.com with basically the same concept and same format. We 'll be looking for writers and contributors on all political issues... <p> Dreadsen, I know a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama 's pick, but I have to tell you that the word that floated down to me the Thursday before Obama announced Biden was that McCain had made his choice that day. The day before that it trickled that the choice was down to two. It trickled from McCain headquarters, and you do n't get a lot of misinformation from that trickle. So, maybe you 're right, but because of that, I do n't think so. I think he went for a younger version of himself, I think if Jindal had accepted the idea it would have been him instead of Palin, and I think he was going for the overall package and not just the gender. At any rate, I do n't think it mattered who Obama chose. We can say his pick was more as a reaction to Obama himself than Biden. That 's what I believe, because Palin counters Obama, not Biden. <p> Biden is right... at least in the sense that Hillary would have been better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polls would be 60%/%40 in favor of Obama. If/when Obama loses, he
