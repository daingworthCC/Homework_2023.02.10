5054641 <p> At noon on Monday, local time,( 10 p.m. Sunday ET) James Cameron ' s " vertical torpedo " sub broke the surface of the western Pacific, carrying the National Geographic explorer and filmmaker back from the Mariana Trench ' s Challenger Deep -- Earth 's deepest, and perhaps most alien, realm. <p> The first human to reach the 6.8-mile-deep( 11-kilometer-deep) undersea valley solo, Cameron arrived at the bottom with the tech to collect scientific data, specimens, and visions unthinkable in 1960, when the only other manned Challenger Deep dive took place, according to members of the National Geographic expedition. <p> After a faster-than-expected, roughly 70-minute ascent, Cameron 's sub, bobbing in the open ocean, was spotted by helicopter and would soon be plucked from the Pacific by a research ship 's crane. Earlier, the descent to Challenger Deep had taken 2 hours and 36 minutes. <p> Expedition member Kevin Hand called the timing of the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER sub 's ascent " perfect. " <p> Before surfacing about 300 miles( 500 kilometers) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep 's desert-like seafloor and gliding along its cliff walls, the whole time collecting samples and video. <p> Among the 2.5-story-tall sub 's tools are a sediment sampler, a robotic claw, a " slurp gun " for sucking up small seacreatures for study at the surface, and temperature, salinity, and pressure gauges.( See pictures of Cameron 's sub.) <p> Now " the science team is getting ready for the returned samples, " said NASA 's Hand. <p> Cameron -- best known for creating fictional worlds on film( Avatar, Titanic, The Abyss) -- is expected to announce his initial findings later today. After analysis, full results are to be published in a future edition of National Geographic magazine. <p> After breaching the ocean surface, the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER was first spotted by a helicopter owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, a longtime Cameron friend. Allen was on the scene for the historic dive and posted live updates of the event on Twitter from aboard his yacht, the Octopus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Science in Three Dimensions <p> Throughout the Mariana Trench dive, 3-D video cameras were kept whirring, and not just for the benefit of future audiences of planned documentaries. <p> " There is scientific value in getting stereo images because... you can determine the scale and distance of objects from stereo pairs that you ca n't from 2-D images, " Cameron told National Geographic News before the dive. <p> But " it 's not just the video. The sub 's lighting of deepwater scenes -- mainly by an 8-foot( 2.5-meter) tower of LEDs -- is " so, so beautiful, " said Doug Bartlett, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. <p> " It 's unlike anything that you 'll have seen from other subs or other remotely operated vehicles, " said Bartlett, chief scientist for the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE project, a partnership with the National Geographic Society and Rolex.( The Society owns National Geographic News.) <p> As the 57-year-old explorer emerged from the sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical team stood at the ready. <p> But if recent test dives -- including one to more than five miles( eight kilometers meters) down -- are any indication, Cameron should be physically fine, despite having been unable to extend his arms and legs for hours, expedition physician Joe MacInnis told National Geographic News before the dive. <p> " Jim is going to be a little bit stiff and sore from the cramped position, but he 's in really good shape for his age, so I do n't expect any problems at all, " said MacInnis, a long-time Cameron friend. <p> In addition, the sub 's " pilot sphere " has a handlebar, which Cameron could use to pull himself occasionally up during the dive. " Usually, shifting position is all that 's required to buy yourself another few hours, " he said. <p> Because Cameron had prepared extensively for the dive, he should be in good psychological health, said Walter Sipes, an aeronautics psychologist at NASA 's Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this, not just in the simulator but also training dives... and he 's an adventurer, so I really do n't think they 'll have any issues to worry about, " said Sipes, who is not part of the expedition. <p> Still, if Cameron plans to conduct more dives -- which the team has indicated he will -- Sipes recommends he get plenty of rest in between or risk mental fatigue. <p> " When you start to get fatigued, you start making mistakes, " he added. " And since he 's down there solo, he ca n't afford that. He 's a potential single-point failure. " <p> It should be at least a few weeks before any further DEEPSEA CHALLENGE dives, as the director 's next breakneck mission will take him from the middle of the Pacific to London, where he 's due at a premiere of his Titanic 3-D Wednesday. <p> While remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs, are much less expensive than manned subs, " the critical thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that environment, " expedition member Patricia Fryer said, " to be able to turn your head and look around to see what the relationships are between organisms in a community and to see how they 're behaving -- to turn off all the lights and just sit there and watch and not frighten the animals, so that they behave normally. <p> " That is almost impossible to do with an ROV, " said Fryer, a marine geologist at the Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics &; Planetology. <p> Andy Bowen, project manager and principal developer of the Nereus, an ROV that explored Challenger Deep in 2009, said a manned mission also has the potential to inspire public imagination in a way a robot ca n't. <p> " It 's difficult to anthropomorphize machines in a way that engages everyone 's imagination -- not in the same way that having boots on the ground, so to speak, can do, " said Bowen, who 's not an expedition member. <p> Biological oceanographer Lisa Levin, also at Scripps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating public interest in deep-ocean science is as important as any new species Cameron might have discovered. <p> " I consider Cameron to be doing for the trenches what Jacques Cousteau did for the ocean many decades ago, " said Levin, who 's part of the team but did not participate in the seagoing expedition. <p> At a time of fast-shrinking funds for undersea research, " what scientists need is the public support to be able to continue exploration and research of the deep ocean, " Levin said. <p> Perhaps referring to his friend 's most recent movie, expedition physician MacInnis called Cameron a real-world " avatar. " <p> " He 's down there on behalf of everybody else on this planet, " he said. " There are seven billion people who ca n't go, and he can. And he 's aware of that. " <p> For his part, Cameron seems sure that the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER will be exploring the depths for a long time to come. In fact, he 's so confident @ @ @ @ @ @
