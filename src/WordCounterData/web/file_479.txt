5074741 <h> Q : What should I do to make sure my pets are taken care of if I die? " <p> September 30th, 2012 by cathay <p> Q : " Please tell me the process and documents required to leave instructions as to what is to happen to my animals should I pass away before them. " <p> Consideration for our pets ' well-being while we are their caregivers may very well extend into a time when we are gone and they are still living. Here are some resources to help with planning for this possible situation. <p> Although this article is dated 2010, the information it gives is pertinent today. The document linked in that article offers ideas for notifying emergency personnel, and for giving specific information about your pets to family, neighbors and friends. <p> Information about leaving a trust fund can start with a site devoted to laws and animals, called " Animal Law : Animal Legal and Historical Center " from Michigan State University 's College of Law.

The article gives guidelines for how to leave enough provisions for each pet, to help ensure they are taken care of for their normal lifespans. For example, a rule of thumb for determining a well funded trust is to calculate an average expense of $1,000 per year. <p> The American Association of Retired Persons( AARP) also offers tips for caring for pets when they outlive their owners with an article called " In Pets We Trust " by Laura Daily( 2008). The article mentions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with the state in which you live. They also suggest to " name someone other than the caregiver as trustee to dole out the cash. This reduces the risk of someone taking the money, but selling or destroying your pet. " <p> These resources should give you enough information to be able to make informed decisions for establishing a plan for your pets ' care if you happen to outlive them, whether you have parrots, horses, dogs, cats, turtles or other common animal companions. Thank you again for asking! <p> Feel free to come back to your Delaware Library if you have more questions, anytime! We appreciate your service in person and online through
