5080141 <h> ' DWTS ' : All-Stars dive right back into the fray <h> by Bryan Alexander, USA TODAY <h> Sponsored Links <p> Joey Fatone showed up at a recent Dancing With the Stars rehearsal to find fellow contestant Gilles Marini in a bit of a footwork funk. <p> " Gilles was getting so frustrated with his dance, " Fatone recalls. " I said, ' Gilles, just relax. You tense up so much because you want it so bad. ' " <p> Well, obviously. This is Dancing With the Stars ' All-Star Edition. <p> Season 15, starting Monday( ABC 8 ET/PT), is the first time the best competitors from the past go head-to-head for the ultimate celebrity ballroom dance bragging rights, and the first All-Star disco ball trophy. <p> The selected celebs are pulling out all the heavy artillery for Week 1 -- normally a time when dance teams are still testing out their weaponry. <p> " This time out of the gate, everyone 's coming out with guns blazing, " says Fatone. " Even the professional dancers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always saying, ' We have to do this and that. This is the All-Stars. ' " <p> The stakes are high and immediate. Someone is going home the first week, and there are no traditional weak-link performers to be sacrificed to the early rounds. <p> " You have people who were the stars in their respective seasons, " says host Tom Bergeron.

" <p> For every dancer there is a fascinating subplot as well. Marini will renew his dance rivalry with Shawn Johnson, who beat him out for the championship in Season 8.( " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " says Johnson). <p> Meanwhile, Fatone and Ono are renewing their Season 4 duel in which Ono walked home with the trophy on the final night. " I got my eye on everyone, " says Fatone. " But I just do n't want Apolo to win again. " <p> The competitive flames rise even higher as most of the teams practice at the same L.A. location for the first time. " You 're trying to size everyone up, " says Fatone. " There 's a lot of smack talk. It 's highly entertaining. " <p> On result-night Tuesday, one All Star will be sent home. The fear of being the initial casualty calls for even a greater push for first-week heroics. <p> " Imagine how horrible it will be to the first person voted off. It 's not going to be fun for that person, " Bergeron says with a laugh. " I 'll try not to
