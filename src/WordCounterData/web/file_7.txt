Like most countries in the region, conditions are always subject to change and travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns. Demonstrations are rare in The Gambia. Travelers driving a vehicle in The Gambia are obligated to stop at all roadblocks or road checkpoints in the country.

Here are some useful tips for traveling safely abroad. <p> CRIME : Petty street crime is a problem in The Gambia. Travelers should be careful of pickpockets in crowded markets areas and on ferries. Packages or luggage should never be left unattended, especially in taxis. U.S. citizens in The Gambia should be careful not to leave valuables or identity documents unsecured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious of individuals who persistently offer unsolicited help. <p> Visitors and resident U.S. citizens should leave their windows up and doors locked while driving due to several reported automobile burglaries, including theft from occupied cars stopped in traffic with the windows open or doors unlocked. Long-term residents should consider hiring a security guard for their home to prevent burglary and theft. <p> Women should avoid walking alone especially after dark, including in beach and tourist areas. In addition, female visitors to The Gambia should be particularly cautious of men locally known as " bumsters, " who approach females wishing " just to get to know you " or offering to be tour guides. Bumsters often use romance in hopes of gaining money and other assistance, or in the hope of departing The Gambia through marriage to a Westerner. Travelers are advised to be polite but decisive in turning down unwanted help or attempts at conversation. <p> Business fraud, long associated with other parts of West Africa, has also been reported in The Gambia. The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses sent, but did not receive, payment for shipments. U.S. citizens should be very suspicious of any unsolicited offers to participate in lucrative business opportunities, especially if they require financial disclosures, money transfers, large up-front investments or promises of confidentiality. The best way to avoid becoming a victim of fraud is common sense -- if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. You should be suspicious of any unsolicited business proposal originating in The Gambia. Carefully scrutinize all proposals before you commit any funds, provide any goods or services, or undertake any travel. For additional information, please see the Department of State 's information on International Financial Scams. <p> The U.S. Embassy has also been contacted by several victims of romantic Internet scams perpetrated in The Gambia.

This person, who can claims to be a U.S. citizen or a Gambian citizen, eventually requests financial assistance from the U.S. citizen to help pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a recent robbery, or to pay some form of alleged exit tax or government fine. In the vast majority of cases, the person with whom the U.S. citizen has been corresponding is using a fake identity and is in no need of assistance. In general, U.S. citizens are advised not to send money to anyone they have not met in person. For more information on this type of scam, please refer to the State Department brochure on International Financial Scams, specifically, the section on Internet Dating and Romance Scams. <p> Do n't buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available.

Engaging in sexual conduct with children, or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country, is a crime and is prosecutable in the United States. If you break local laws in The Gambia, your U.S. passport wo n't help you avoid arrest or prosecution.

Dual nationals should inquire at a Gambian embassy or consulate regarding their status. <p> In May 2008, Gambian government leaders, including the country 's president, strongly condemned homosexuality and advocated for greatly increased penalties for anyone harboring homosexuals. However, no legislative action has resulted. The Gambia 's existing laws already criminalize homosexual sex acts, but current laws do not include the death penalty. Violations of the laws against homosexual sex acts are occasionally pursued and Gambian citizens have been prosecuted under these laws. In June 2008, two Western tourists were detained but not charged under this section of the criminal code. <p> The Gambia has strict laws on the import and export of skin-bleaching creams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1% or more of : hydroquinone( in any form), hydrocortisone( unless in trace amounts and for specific purposes such anti-itch products), betamethasone, flucinonide, clobestatol, or clobestatone are subject to fines up to $2,000 and/or three years imprisonment. <p> Airport police and customs officials routinely inspect incoming and outgoing luggage. Airline passengers are required to put their luggage through an x-ray machine before departing the airport.

For a list of prohibited items, travelers should contact the nearest Gambian embassy or consulate. <p> It is against the law for tourists to photograph or film government buildings, including airports, military installations or embassies due to security concerns. <p> The Gambia 's currency, the dalasi, is freely convertible but is not widely available outside the country. The Gambia has a cash economy and travelers should carry sufficient currency to cover all expenses for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus. Changing money unofficially is prohibited and individuals who do so may face prosecution. Travelers should be aware that The Gambia has many last-minute holidays requiring banks and other businesses to close. Travelers should always have enough cash to carry them through unexpected bank closures. <p> Credit cards are accepted only at major hotels, some grocery stores, and a few restaurants. Local personal checks from U.S. citizens are accepted only at exchange bureaus and only from U.S. citizens who are resident in The Gambia. There are a few ATMs in the Banjul area, but they often malfunction or fail to issue receipts. ATMs only accept VISA cards for international transactions and only dispense a maximum of about $140.00( in local currency) per transaction, with three transactions allowed per day. Money transfers are widely available at Western Union branch offices in The Gambia. <p> Accessibility : While in The Gambia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation to be different from the United States.

Travelers who become ill with a fever or flu-like illness while traveling in a malaria-risk area( and for up to one year after returning home) should seek prompt medical attention and tell the physician their travel history, as well as what anti-malarial medications they have been taking. For additional information on malaria, protection from insect bites, and anti-malarial drugs, visit the CDC website. <p> MEDICAL INSURANCE : You ca n't assume your insurance will go with you when you travel. It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your medical insurance will cover you overseas. You need to ask your insurance company two questions : <p> Does my policy apply when I 'm out of the United States? <p> Will it cover emergencies like a trip to a foreign hospital or a medical evacuation? <p> In many places, doctors and hospitals still expect payment in cash( local currency) at the time of service. Your regular U.S. health insurance may not cover doctors ' and hospital visits in other countries. If your policy does n't go with you when you travel, it 's a very good idea to take out another one for your trip. For more information, please see our medical insurance overseas page. <p> TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS : While in The Gambia, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning The Gambia is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance. <p> Travel in The Gambia is difficult due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which generally lasts from June through October. Although there are paved main roads in the greater Banjul area, many are poorly maintained and poorly lit. With the installation of street lights on roads in the Banjul area, some drivers no longer use their vehicle lights at night. <p> Most roads outside the Banjul area are still unlit and unpaved. Caution should be exercised when using taxis, particularly at night. Most taxis lack safety belts and some are not road-worthy. Livestock and pedestrians pose road hazards throughout the country, including in the greater Banjul area. Drivers and pedestrians should exercise extreme caution to prevent accidents. <p> Numerous accidents are caused by intoxicated drivers. Tests are rarely done to determine levels of intoxication. If you are suspected of causing an accident while intoxicated, and the case is taken to trial, you may be subject to a substantial fine or imprisonment. <p> The police do not consistently apply traffic laws and regulations, and sometimes compel drivers to pay fines on the spot for violations, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police periodically set up impromptu traffic stops on major streets to check for drivers ' licenses and proper insurance. Drivers should not attempt to drive around these traffic stops. <p> Government convoys frequently travel at high speeds and often in either or both lanes of traffic, including in the oncoming traffic lane, requiring cars to move off the road. Whenever there are police lights or sirens, drivers should move off the road immediately and completely to avoid collisions. There are no trauma centers in The Gambia and severe accidents often require evacuation to Senegal or Europe. <p> Water transportation in the region can be unpredictable and risky. Ferries rarely keep to their posted schedules. The ferries, which are often overcrowded, usually lack sufficient numbers of life preservers for all passengers. In particular, the wooden dugout " pirogues " that cross the Gambia River often leave shore overloaded and occasionally sink in the middle of the river. U.S. citizens are advised to exit their cars during the crossing. U.S. citizens who must cross the Gambia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banjul-Barra or Yelitenda-Farafenni ferries, which are slower but safer than the privately operated pirogues. <p> Please refer to our Road Safety page for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the website of the country 's national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety. <p> AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT : The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration( FAA) has assessed the government of The Gambia 's Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization( ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of The Gambia 's air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the FAA safety assessment page. <p> Gambian airlines do not offer service to the United States. Services provided by the West African regional air carriers that service Banjul are sometimes unreliable. The airlines are known to alter scheduled stops, cancel or postpone flights on short notice, and regularly overbook flights. Travelers may experience unexpected delays even after check-in, and should be prepared to handle alternate ticketing and/or increased food and lodging expenses
