5254241 <h> Inquirer Editorial : DHS has to be a better boss <p> August 14, 2012 <p> The horrendous starvation death of Danieal Kelly in 2006 exposed serious flaws in the city 's Department of Human Services and its inability to protect vulnerable children. <p> A recently announced reorganization of DHS will try to addresses those weaknesses by giving private contractors direct supervision over cases of abused and neglected children. It goes without saying that such a move will require much better oversight than DHS has provided in the past. <p> Nonetheless, the overhaul at this point has to be seen as another positive step being made by DHS Commissioner Anne Marie Ambrose since she took over the troubled agency in 2008. An overhaul of how DHS handles cases was among three dozen reforms recommended by a blue-ribbon panel after Danieal 's death. <p> Story continues below. <p> Initial investigations would still be conducted by DHS, and the agency would remain legally responsible for the children under its system.

The 14-year-old child with cerebral palsy weighed only 46 pounds when her bedsore-covered corpse was found in a rundown rowhouse. DHS and the private contractor assigned to her case failed. Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on criminal charges. <p> By phasing the plan in over four years, Ambrose will have time to make changes as necessary. She also told the Inquirer Editorial Board she would n't hesitate to scrap the strategy if it does n't work. That 's the right attitude. <p> DHS must make sure its contractors and subcontractors are doing their jobs - and when they are n't, it must act before a child is harmed. DHS has for decades used outside agencies to handle cases, but never to this extent. To make
