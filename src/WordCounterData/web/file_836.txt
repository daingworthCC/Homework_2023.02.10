5253341 <h> Obama Gets a Look at the Bottom of the Bus, Courtesy of Petraeus <p> It seems like since the beginning of his administration, the Blamer in Chief has been throwing people under the proverbial bus whenever things go wrong, from former President Bush to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. <p> Now, Fox News has reported that two former Navy SEALs ' requests for assistance during the Benghazi attack that ended up killing four Americans were rejected three times by the CIA annex. <p> Not willing to take the hit, CIA Director David Petraeus ordered a statement issued to the press that neither he nor anyone at the CIA had anything to do in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need ; claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate, " according to the statement. <p> Earlier this week, The Blaze reported that Clinton had requested more security for the Benghazi mission before the attacks occurred on September 11, but the request was rejected by Obama. <p> Petraeus ' denial of involvement in rejecting the SEALs pleas for help leaves the president twisting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone at the CIA, then the order could only have come from the Oval Office, assuming ordinary protocol was followed. <p> The father of one of the slain SEALs, Charles Woods, has called the White House version of what happened at Benghazi a " pack of lies. " He said in an interview, " To me -- I 'm an attorney, this may not legal test of murder -- but to me, that is not only cowardice. For those people who made the decision and who knew about the decision and lied about it are murderers of my son. " <p> Obama spent part of Friday dodging direct questions about the refusal of aid during the Benghazi attack. Instead of answering, he talked about " gathering all the facts " and said, " Nobody wants to find out more what happened than I do. " <p> There 's good reason to believe he knows exactly what happened and will continue lying about it at least until after the election. To the mainstream media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is, it seems more and more likely that the blood of those slain Americans is on the hands of the president. <p> Why has n't Petraeus resigned? Does he need the job that bad? Anyone with any intergrity would not want to be associated with this corrupt regime. <p> http : **34;5264;TOOLONG.... Donnie Cheesman <p> Commander David Petraeus serves the American people -- first ; not Oba'ma first. <p> deseartu <p> The President does n't have a conscience because Satin does n't have one! One in the same! the new Hitler, and if re-elected, everyone who voted for him can then look in the mirror when the world self destructs! Thanks for your vote! You ca n't fix stupid! <p> http : **34;5300;TOOLONG.... Donnie Cheesman <p> David Petraeus is a man of honor -- he will not betray those in uniform or lie to American citizens for Ba'rak Oba'ma. <p> http : **35;5336;TOOLONG...

Remeber no one has to demand information on Benghazi. All that needs to happen is the demand for Hillary to step down and then you will hear her tell the truth. <p> Dr. Pepper MJ <p> Impeach Hillary for her being responsible for Benghazi and the she will start to sing instead of protect the white house guest.

Who do you think it is? <p> Contact your Congressmen and Senators demand that Obama is IMPEACHED and charged with Treason for the murders of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith a Foreign Service information officer, and Tyrone S.

My respect for him has been greatly diminished since he was bought by Obama. <p> Michael <p> With regret do I suggest that it wo n't matter how much you press the media outlets to change their philosophy and focus to cover that which they are indifferent to. You must understand that they have shifted their rationale from objective, fact-based reporting to advocacy journalism wherein they take a position and defend it by assailing -- or not reporting -- that which does not " merit " their interest. <p> JohnW <p> I know a couple of democrats who have the atitude of " I always vote democrat and always have " I am very conservative and ca n't understand why they would sabatage our country just because some family tradition.This admin. is n't even dem they are plain outright communist. <p> djw663 <p> Commander in Chief, not a title to be taken lightly ; on the golf course or on vacation while America has been facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not done I do n't go on vacation, too many families depend on me to make the right decisions everyday and if something is broken I fix it ; today, right now not after I play golf for four and a half hours.

I will rejoin my family ASAP and playing golf does not help anyone unless it is meeting with the leader of a nation to build relations and I do n't see Obama doing that. <p> pearl87 <p> Something tells me Obama 's hands are no strangers to blood, anymore than his lips are to lies. <p> http : **32;5410;TOOLONG The Lone Gunman <p> I think that by the new year, we will know that the stand-down order came from Obama. What we know already from internal military sources is that Africom Commander, General Carter Ham, is being replaced by Obama because he objected too strongly to the stand-down order.
