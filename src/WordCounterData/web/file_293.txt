5056041 <p> All That Can Be Shaken by Essie Collins( a pseudonym) is a moving true story of a family 's struggle with a tragedy that shakes their lives and their faith. Essie 's idyllic life is torn apart when her once joyful and exuberant husband, Stephen, is stricken with a deep depression. His suicidal tendencies force Essie to seek professional help. After shock treatment and a barrage of medications, Stephen becomes severely mentally ill, diagnosed as bi-polar and schizophrenic. Essie 's story will take you through the horrors her family endures as they become prey to a society that is largely unsympathetic and unequipped to help. <p> Theme song for this audio book is " Silver Shine " by Dan-O.
