5031141 <h> Is it normal that my toddler pushes food out of his mouth with his tongue? <p> It depends -- is this a new problem or one he 's had a while? Does it happen once in a while or all the time? With toddlers, it 's sometimes hard to distinguish between what they do n't want to do and what they ca n't do. If it happens sporadically, it 's likely that your child simply does n't like certain foods and is spitting them out, which is, unfortunately, perfectly normal for a toddler. If it 's a new behavior that occurs repeatedly at meals and does not seem to be food-specific, it could mean he 's sick and is rejecting food because he ca n't swallow it. A very sore throat, for example, can lead a toddler to refuse food that hurts going down. Inflammation or infection of the tonsils, an abscess, or laryngitis might do the same thing. <p> If it 's a chronic behavior -- something your son does all the time -- I 'd take a closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- for example, if your son eats pretty well but refuses foods that need a lot of chewing, such as hot dogs and hamburgers -- might signal an oral motor skill problem or a sensory processing disorder. Tongue thrusting can also be associated with cerebral palsy. Although doctors are most likely to diagnose cerebral palsy when a child is an infant because it is associated with other motor abnormalities, mild cases can appear during the toddler years as children make the switch from liquid to solid foods. <h> Member Comments <p> My daughter had always been a great eater and never picky at all. Then suddenly everything we gave her she would chew up and spit out. She also stopped sleeping through the night. She would wake up fighting mad and scream for hours. I was very concerned and her peditrician just told me she was spoiled. I took her for a second opinion and was sent to a specialist and she ended up having Reflux. Easily controlled with medication, and I had my angel back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 months old and she is rarely picky on the foods she eat. A few months ago she started on taking her food out of her mouth, when food goes in her mouth, half of the time. My mom says that she wants to do experiment on her food and is curious on how the her foods feel. Even though I ca n't stand it and it is disgusting, my mom told me it is just a phase. <p> My 1yr old often spits out food thats a new texture or temp. That has a strong new taste. Sometimes I 'll try again in a few mins and he 'll love it. Otherwise next time we have it.. Some days he 's very picky with what he eats.. other days he 'll ea whatever I give him pretty much. <p> My son will eat just about anything without a problem but if he notices anyone watching him he will push his food out of his mouth to see their reaction. Sometimes when he just being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth he will spit it out. <p> i think in this regard you can seek the help of a speech therapist who would teach you certain things to be done at home to his tongue and mouth.............. like stimulating with finger brush and massaging the palate etc... regarding the feeding method etc.my two year old son does the same... but now speech therapy has helped him in getting used to mild chewing....... in keeping the tongue within... mother need to do these mouth exercises regularly fr the child. <p> My 18 month old son does it just cause, he will take a bite and then look at me and just push it all out with his tongue and I 'm thinking that he thinks I 'm going to laugh which i once did when he did it, so he thinks it 's just funny and does it once in a while when he eats and then he 'll try to pick it up off the floor and re eat it which I do n't allow, I believe it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COURSE THERE ARE SOME MELLOW DRAMATIC PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY NEGATIVE THINGS AND JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION OF LIKE " OH MY GOD YOUR KID HAS A MENTAL DISORDER " OR " HIS TONSILS ARE SQUEEZED TOGETHER " OR " HE NEEDS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ", I say get a grip people, some things toddlers just like to experiment on and it 's okay! QUIT MAKING PEOPLE SO NERVOUS ABOUT THEIR KIDS BY DIAGNOSING SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW. <p> I know my 14 month old will chew up and spit out things with skin on it, like peas. I 've also seen her spit food out when it was to hot. I know I should have caught that before she did! I also think she does it sometimes when she puts to much food in her mouth. <p> my 15 month old son just started doing this a few weeks ago. even with food that he loves to eat( or atleast loves it for a few days) he 's a picky eater.... especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his teeth and top 2 molars and k9s are coming out now. i 'm happy if i can get 1 solid meal in him a day. he still drinks his milk and pediasure, so he 's getting nutrition........ some random lady in a restaurant told us it 's very normal and if they have to chew too long, they just spit it out. she 's got 2 grown kids, so i guess it ca n't be that bad. my son 's got his well visit next week.... lets see what the doctor 's opinion will be........ <p> I may have my son checked this is a chronic behavior for him, he 's been doing it since he was about 14 months old and he is 22months old, we notice most w/meat, we thought it was hard to chew or he does n't care for the texture, he also does it w/anything that has egg in it. Anyway... it never hurts to double check. I hope nothing is wrong but at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough protein. <p> My son is barely ever picky. His favourite thing to eat is Mac and Cheese. Sometimes he just gets bored and his tongue pushes out the food. He may do this often but he still goes back eating his mac and cheese. So, I 'm pretty confident this has nothing to
