5043341 <h> Questions from the TV show, " Lie to Me " <p> The show " Lie to Me " has once more demonstrated the power of television and the media. I say that because I have seen this several times before. Let me explain. When the movie Silence of the Lambs came out and later several TV shows about " criminal profiling " followed, suddenly my university students all seemed to want to be " criminal profilers. " This in spite of the fact that most good investigators do their own " criminal analysis "( read profiling) without the need of a full time profiler. The emails I received also echoed interest in profiling from as far away as Australia and Turkey, to the tune of about several dozen per week. <p> Later when the CSI TV series came out, profiling was no longer in vogue and my students wanted to be Crime Scene Investigators. Once again they did n't realize that in most police departments you do n't actually want to be the Crime Scene Investigator( trust me - it is dirty, smelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want to do is be the detective. Here too emails soon followed and still do, mirroring this media driven desire to become a criminalist. <h> Find Local : <p> So it was not surprising to me when the show " Lie to Me " gained popularity and the emails started to flow to me via my website asking me all sort of questions about the show ; where you could get a job like that, the honesty of the claims they were making, and whether or not you really could tell if people were lying as they claim. <p> Having seen the first two shows, I can see why people are so interested and fascinated by the show and how nonverbals can be used to detect deception. <p> After fielding many questions by email and via Twitter, it is time to set the record straight here in my Psychology Today Blog where I can reach the most people all at once. <p> Before I do so, I have to say, the questions are all fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reality and reality is often much different than the hundreds of hours of fictional pulp we have been fed. So here are the questions I am most often asked and my answer to each : <p> Question : Is it true that you can detect deception as easily as they demonstrate on the show? <p> Answer : No! Nooo! Nooooo! It is not that easy. In fact detecting deception is very difficult. As Paul Ekman, the dean of deception research since the 1980s( and who is the consultant to the show) has demonstrated, over and over, along with other researchers : we humans are no better than chance, 50-50 at detecting deception. You might as well toss a coin and call heads or tails. <p> Question : What about the so called " Wizards " who are better than chance at detecting deception? <p> Answer : Studies on the so called " Wizards "( poor choice of name as it suggests a bit of black magic to what should be science based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of us( I have heard everything from less than 1% of the population to less than 30 out of 14,000 tested) rise well above chance( 68%) at detecting deception. <p> That is all fine and good, but most of us do n't carry a Wizard with us to help us sort things out when we need them the most. While it is interesting that there are " Wizards " out there, in practical terms it is no more than a curiosity. There are over 17,000 individual police departments in the US and there are tens of thousands of interviews being conducted at any one moment ; you can no more count on having one of these " Wizards " there to help you than you can count on a polygraph examination during a traffic stop wherever that may be. There are n't that many and it 's not cost effective. <p> And so when I hear students who want to be tested to be a Wizard, or email me to take the " Wizard test "( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what for? To me that 's like taking an IQ test to see how you score. Now what? <p> I remind students and those that email me that while these so called " Wizards " have been tested in laboratory settings, police work is not so neat and clean. Over 95% of all police interviews are done on the street : car stops, in doorways( domestic situations), in the presence of others, in noisy dangerous environments under limited or poor lighting conditions. That is much different than in a quiet laboratory without distractions where you can concentrate fully. <p> Question : What about culture? <p> Answer : Good question, the show " Lie to Me " does n't appear to take into account culture or its significance in discerning deception, but then a lot of research into deception does n't either. For example, African Americans and many people from Latin America are taught to look down or away when confronted by authority figures( parents, elders, police) as a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions a week about looking down or away as a sign of deception. It is not indicative of deception even though many people believe that it is. In fact, in my experience and that of some researchers, pathological liars actually engage in more eye contact, not less. <p> And it is not just TV. I have talked to researchers in the area of nonverbals who are not familiar with cultural influences in detecting deception because they base their research in the laboratory. For instance, the nose crinkle is often performed as a sign of disgust. And yet, as I explained to one major researcher, you have to be careful because in the Caribbean, especially in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, even in Miami now, the nose crinkle is used to say, " How may I help you? Or What do you want?, " and it has nothing to do with disgust. The researcher had never heard of this behavior and yet when I asked Puerto Rican students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his astonishment. <p> Question : What about contempt, that seems to be a good indicator of deception, right? <p> Answer : Wrong. There is no single indicator of deception, and contempt is not, I repeat, not an indicator of deception. As I stated in What Every Body is Saying and reiterated in my latest book " Clues to Deceit, " quoting from my friend and nonverbal researcher Dr. Mark Frank, there is no " Pinocchio Effect, " no single behavior indicative of deception. " But on the show, " they say, " contempt is shown definitively as a sign of deception. " The answer is still no! <p> The truth about contempt is that criminals and guilty people often show signs of contempt when being interviewed. However, just walk through a neighborhood you do n't belong in as a police officer and you will see over and over again signs of contempt, even from the innocent. Contempt is displayed not because they have guilty knowledge or committed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as an officer or what you represent. <p> In Latin America you see contempt from the honest person who is of high status but is being questioned by someone deemed by them of lower status or of lesser education or social ranking. I have also seen contempt from the pathologically narcissistic as they react to questions from those they deem below them, which is just about everybody in their eyes. So I would caution anyone to claim or proclaim they can tell someone is lying just from displays of contempt, that is just absolute unsubstantiated rubbish. <p> Question : What about facial cues and micro-expressions, are n't they reliable indicators of deception? <p> Answer : No, and they never have been! They are accurate indicators of sentiments and feelings and of psychological discomfort leaking out, but not necessarily of deception. Many times when we see these facial cues or fast( tachy-expressions is probably more accurate as they are not so much small : micro as they are fast : tachy) expressions they are indicative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is causing that. Obviously if they react to certain questions only with indicators of discomfort then the interviewer needs to explore why. But one can never assume to know that these behaviors are manifestations of deception. In one case, I have previously written about, a woman showed multiple micro-expressions during the interview, but it was because of her concern about her car getting a parking ticket because the parking meter was running out, not because she was lying. Here the expressions were
