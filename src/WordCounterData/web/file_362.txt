He was stationed in Guernsey when he deserted the army to be with his sweetheart. To avoid the military police he went first to South Africa, then to India, before ending up working as a farm hand on a mate 's ranch in Australia, which was where he was when the fighting began. Unable to join the British army again due to his deserter status, he volunteered along with his best friend and 1 in 2 Australian men for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and was shipped off to a place on the coast of Turkey known as Gallipoli. <p> The Anzac troops landed on the shores of the Dardanelles amid a hail of machine gun and shell fire. He distinguished himself by capturing a Turkish machine gun post and turning the gun upon its previous owners. He was wounded in the early days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria, Egypt, to recover. He was then sent back to Gallipoli in time to take part in the diversionary assault on the heavily fortified trench position at Lone Pine. <p> The Turkish trenches were deep and well constructed, sandbagged and covered with logs and earthworks. Although the Australians had the shortest distance to cover over no-man 's land( only 100 meters) they had to do so under heavy enfilading machine gun and rifle fire from the well entrenched Turks. <p> Once across the blasted waste and into the trenches the Anzac soldiers found themselves fighting in a hot, dark, cramped press of men ; thousands of fighting figures crammed into a trench only a few feet wide. The conditions were so tight that rifles could not be used and the battle devolved into a melee of entrenching tools, knives, clubs and fists. In the hideous, gloomy, bloody mess of those trenches friend and foe were all but indistinguishable.

It is a day to remember all the dead, all those who did not grow old. It is a day to mark so that people like my great uncle do not have to go through such a nightmare again. <p> So if you have a problem with remembrance day, then you are remembering it wrong. posted by dazedone at 1:38 AM on November 11 81 favorites <p> " But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me.

" Never again " is a frequent refrain. Typical events include pipers and veterans marching to the war memorial for wreath-laying ceremonies and/or a gun salute.

But here, a man was speaking in glowing, honorable tones about the " sacrifice " soldiers had made in that war, speaking as though he knew the dead soldiers personally.

It certainly sounds like many( here, at least) use the day to think about the insanity of war and the terrible suffering of the fallen, and that war is something we should be ashamed of.

In a crevice between the rocks lie two graves covered by a single heap of stones. No monument marks them, for they escaped notice during the official survey, and the heap of stones has blended into the desolate and austere outline of the hill. The peninsula is turning towards the sun, and as the rays strike Achi Baba the graves begin to speak. <p> FIRST GRAVE : We are important again upon earth. Each morning men mention us. <p> SECOND GRAVE : Yes, after seven years ' silence. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to the " sanctity of our graves in Gallipoli.

It is we, not they, who lie on Achi Baba. <p> FIRST GRAVE : They say " our " out of geniality and in order to touch the great heart of our nation more quickly. Punch, the great-hearted jester, showed a picture lately in which the Prime Minister of England, Lloyd George, fertile in counsels, is urged to go to war to protect " the sanctity of our graves in Gallipoli. " The elderly artist who designed that picture is not dead and does not mean to die. He hopes to illustrate this war as he did the last, for a sufficient salary. Nevertheless he writes " our " graves, as if he was inside one, and all persons of position now say the same. <p> SECOND GRAVE : If they go to war, there will be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire. That is what Lloyd George, prudent in counsels, and lion-hearted Churchill, intend. <p> SECOND GRAVE : But where will they dig them? <p> FIRST GRAVE : There is still room over in Chanak. Also, it is well for a nation that would be great to scatter its graves all over the world. Graves in Ireland, graves in Irak, Russia, Persia, Inia, each with its inscription from the Bible or Rupert Brooke. When England thinks fit, she can launch an expedition to protect the sanctity of her graves, and can follow that by another expedition to protect the sanctity of the additional graves. That is what Lloyd George, prudent in counsels, and lion-hearted Churchill, have planned. Churchill planned this expedition to Gallipoli, where I was killed. He planned the expedition to Antwerp, where my brother was killed. Then he said that Labour is not fit to govern.

He is Churchill the Fortunate, ever in office, and clouds of dead heroes attend him. Nothing for schools, nothing for houses, nothing for the life of the body, nothing for the spirit. England can not spare a penny for anything except her heroes ' graves. <p> SECOND GRAVE : Is she really putting herself to so much expense on our account? <p> FIRST GRAVE : For us, and for the Freedom of the Straits. That water flowing below us now--it must be thoroughly free. What freedom is, great men are uncertain, but all agree that the water must be free for all nations ; if in peace, then for all nations in peace ; if in war, then for all nations in war. <p> SECOND GRAVE : So all nations now support England. <p> FIRST GRAVE : It is almost inexplicable. England stands alone. Of the dozens of nations into which the globe is divided, not a single one follows her banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECOND GRAVE : Yes... inexplicable. Perhaps she fights for some other reason. <p> FIRST GRAVE : Ah, the true reason of a war is never known until all who have fought in it are dead. In a hundred years ' time we shall be told. Meanwhile seek not to inquire. There are rumours that rich men desire to be richer, but we can not know. <p> SECOND GRAVE : If rich men desire more riches, let them fight. It is reasonable to fight for our desires. <p> FIRST GRAVE : But they can not fight. They must not fight. There are too few of them. They would be killed. If a rich man went into the interior of Asia and tried to take more gold or more oil, he might be seriously injured at once. He must persuade poor men, who are numerous, to go there for him. And perhaps this is what Lloyd George, fertile in counsels, has decreed. He has tried to enter Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who, seven years ago, failed to join England after they had promised to do so, and our graves in Gallipoli are the result of this. But Churchill the Fortunate, ever in office, ever magnanimous, bore the Greeks no grudge, and he and Lloyd George persuaded their young men to enter Asia. They have mostly been killed there, so English young men must be persuaded instead. A phrase must be thought of, and " the Gallipoli graves " is the handiest. The clergy must wave their Bibles, the old men their newspapers, the old women their knitting, the unmarried girls must wave white feathers, and all must shout, " Gallipoli graves, Gallipoli graves, Gallipoli, Gally Polly, Gally Polly, " until the young men are ashamed and think, What sound can that be but my country 's call? and Chanak receives them. <p> SECOND GRAVE : Chanak is to sanctify Gallipoli. <p> FIRST GRAVE : It will make our heap of stones for ever England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that to my portion of it. I was a Turk. <p> FIRST GRAVE : What! A Turk! You a Turk? And I have lain beside you for seven years and never known! <p> SECOND GRAVE : How should you have known? What is there to know except that I am your brother? <p> FIRST GRAVE : I am yours... <p> SECOND GRAVE : All is dead except that. All graves are one. It is their unity that sanctifies them, and some day even the living will learn this. <p> FIRST GRAVE : Ah, but why can they not learn it while they are still alive? His comrade can not answer this question. Achi Baba passes beneath the sun, and so long as there is light warlike preparations can be seen on the opposite coast. Presently all objects enter into their own shadows, and through the general veil thus formed the stars become apparent. <p> That " whole generation who were butchered and damned " left generations behind them, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gassed in the very last days of the war( Meuse-Argonne).

It is interesting to me to see the contrast between American Veteran 's Day.

Previous to enlisting he was a most energetic worker in all patriotic efforts, and was untiring in his work on behalf of the men who had gone to the front.

He organised working bees on the orchard blocks belonging to men who were on active service, and every soldier who went from Nyah carried to his comrades at the front stories of what Val Foster was doing for them, earning for him the undying gratitude of Nyah soldiers and their dependents.
