5103441 <p> I 've expended a lot of effort trying to point out the truth about the Chevy Volt fires, knowing I might not reach a broad audience but might get the chief disseminators of misinformation( Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, et al) to say " Wow! I guess I did n't realize that no Volt,( other than ones deliberately destroyed), ever showed as much as a wisp of smoke! I guess I had better retune my rhetoric! " <p> Such were the musings of my politically naive brain, especially since I knew O'Reilly has seen my writing because " his people " talked to me. <p> What happened, instead, was more cruel disappointment : In his nationally syndicated column Saturday, the intellectually gifted and highly respected Charles Krauthammer, my hero-figure on the Right, joined the rest of the prevaricators. The topic was Obama 's failed energy policy, and the litany of drilling bans and incomprehensible failure to approve the eminently useful Keystone Pipeline. So far, so good. <p> But, just as I was savoring Krauthammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Volt cited as yet another example of Obama 's misguided, interventionist energy policy. To make matters worse, Krauthammer could not resist attaching the adjective " flammable " to the Volt. <p> Now, Krauthammer is a smart, highly educated and well-informed individual. I have to assume he knows the truth. The fact that he persists in the myth of Volt combustibility and Obama-conception of the vehicle can not be in error. <p> I am, sadly, coming to the conclusion that all the icons of conservatism are( shock, horror!) deliberately not telling the truth! <p> This saddens me, because, to this writer, conservatism IS fundamental truth. It only damages its inherent credibility with momentarily convenient fiction. <p> So, Mr. Krauthammer joins the list of right-wing pundits I no longer take seriously. After all, how do I know they 're telling the truth when the subject is one I 'm not as familiar with as the Volt? <p> That does leave everyone 's trusted favorite, though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, dependable, kind of your favorite uncle when you were growing up... the Reverend Huckabee! He would n't unjustly attack the most celebrated example of American engineering across the Forbes network. You 'll be notified if your comment is called out. <h> Comments <p> Bob I do n't know what to say. The first electric car was built in 1895 and the Volt is supposed to be some kind of big step up? Frankly, I was hoping when GM became government motors, they would cancel the stupid Volt. <p> Let 's review the problems <p> 1. The Volt can go 35 miles on the eletric charge, and then the charge runs out. So that 's pretty crappy. 2. You 're still burning fossil fuels to use the Volt. It has a gasoline engine and to charge it, you are going to burn coal. 3. People that have 32,500-40,000 dollars to spend are not going to by the Volt. They are going to by a Cadillac, Mustang or a Camaro. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that you wrote an article to say " good news! the fires we 're seeing in Volts has nothing to do with the car battery! " <p> How many Volts have been recalled? If the number is in the thousands, obviously there is a problem Bob. <p> How many production cars are recalled every year as part of routine safety improvements? Answer me that one. <p> Coal does n't produce electricity. Less than 10% of electricity in California( PG &E); is made from coal. Tell me, how many different ways can you power an internal combustion engine? And tell me, how many different ways can you produce electricity? <p> For the features and performance you get in a Volt, a comparable Lexus or Infiniti costs pretty much the same... except a Volt is a car you can power off anything electricity is generated from. Tell me, why would you buy a gas-powered car instead of one for the same price that can be powered from gas OR electricity? Hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volt has gained the highest consumer satisfaction rating of any car. Even a 911 Porsche. <p> So who 's stupid. Thousands of owners who drive this car every day or you? <p> I have driven my Volt for 14 months now and have use 23.5 gallons of gas in total. I have n't use any gas this year. I plug it in and drive on my home 's electricity. I can go 100 MPH in this thing! If you recharge your Volt at work and home before the battery runs out you will avoid using gasoline. That 's the new fuel for cars. Electricity, not oil from a pipeline. <p> I have 14,000 miles on my Volt and have been to the gas station 3 times in a year. Never trill up, Not necessary in the Volt. <p> If you do n't buy gasoline a $40K car is pretty cheap. Electricity is way, way cheaper than gasoline. You do have to be able to do math to understand the economics of owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah, I love how Californians think they represent the rest of the country. Almost 44% of our electricity in the United States comes from coal, another 40+% comes from CNG or Nuclear energy, over 80% of our electricity comes from non-renewable fuel sources. While the Volt is an engineering marvel, I contend what is the point of carrying your stored energy in a battery which has a significantly lower energy content per lb. than say, diesel... when the energy is going to come from Coal or CNG anyway for the vast majority of the country? What is the advantage over a CNG powered car that does n't require CNG to be burned to create the electricity you are using? Better yet, since we ARE dependent on Coal, what 's the advantage of battery-electric cars over diesels that could be fueled from algae that feeds off the CO2 emitted by our coal power plants? Good luck selling a Volt in 10 years time for much more than scrap metal value. <p> The Pacific Northwest uses virtually no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " representative " of the rest of the country? Fine by me. Hey Easterners, find yourselves some other airplanes to fly, some other computers to use, and some other coffee to drink. <p> The NHTSA tested the Volt and ran it through one or more crash tests that would mimic a real world situation that a driver might face. The car caught fire a day or two later. <p> What part of this true statement is false? This was reported by a highly regarded national automobile magazine that actually promotes alternative fueled cars and has reported extensively on many hybrid and electric cars, Those on the road and those up and coming cars soon to hit the marketplace( if the companies do not go broke beforehand). <p> GM would n't have offered to replace the cars to owners that had already purchased them if there was not any truth to the fires. <p> Here 's the lie : playing it off like these cars have caught fire in peoples ' homes, while driving, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lab environment. In fact, these liars do n't even MENTION that they were part of a test environment. <p> They 're intentionally misleading people by presenting skewed information, in exactly the same way as saying " people will die if they drink water ". Maybe if I refer to water as " dihydrogen monoxode ", you 'll start telling people they 'll die if they drink it as well? It 's true, is n't it? What part about " you 'll die if you drink dihydrogen monoxide " is false? <p> " The NHTSA tested the Volt and ran it through one or more crash tests that would mimic a real world situation that a driver might face. The car caught fire a day or two later. What part of this true statement is false? " <p> The car( Volt) never caught fire a day or two after a crash. The car was subjected to a side impact test, flipped upside and dragged over to a torage are without ever discharging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice. Three weeks later coolant corroded a circuit board cause a smoldering fire. Three weeks later. There are around 200,000 roadside fires per year and 0 have been Volts. After trying unsuccessfully to replicate the problem at vehicle level, the Volt battery( not the Volt) was tested by itself, fully charged, probed endlessy and smashed to smithereens. It eventually caught fire -- not exactly a real world situation. The fix was a safety enhancement so that if you are irrationaly concerned that after three weeks you may be stuck in a car that has been demolished, you 'll be OK assuming you have n't starved to death. <p> 1. The severely damaged Volt battery was not de-energized by the NHTSA people after the crash test as a standard safety procedure recommended by GM.( They did n't follow the rules of car safety. Remove the gas and or de-energize the battery) Instead they left it in a storage yard and 3 WEEKS later it caught fire. Plenty of time for passengers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered us Volt owners the option of buying back our cars as they knew hardly anyone of us would take them up on that. The Volt has the highest consumer satisfaction rating of any car. Still couple of gold diggers sold their cars back to GM. GM employees quickly snatched up those rare used Volt at a good discount. Many of use owners ask about them, but they were gone fast. <p> Go drive a Volt and make up your own mind. You are being lead by idiots. <p> " The NHTSA tested the Volt and ran it through one or more crash tests that would mimic a real world situation that a driver might face. The car caught fire a day or two later. What part of this true statement is false? " <p> The NHTSA re-testing that you refer to did not include any Volt, it was performed on battery packs only( kind of like testing just a gas tank outside of a car).

Please cite the source that indicates two-days before a fire.( There was, on one occasion, some instantaneous sparking, but that battery pack stabilized in a matter of seconds.) <p> The battery( not the vehicle) caught fire after two weeks, not two days. And if you exaggerate the truth, you become a LIAR! <p> Why have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money( Nissan gets the same $7,500 tax credit for the Leaf as the American Volt), or those thousands of imports which really catch fire and kill their occupants? Because you are targeting the wrong nation! Let us American enjoy our award-winning Volt! Get rid of the imports! <p> Excuse me Ray, but it was not a day or two, but many weeks! The car was also overturned during this whole time. After weeks of it being on it 's back, with a big side impact, sparks began to happen( not fire) and this was because of battery system coolant lines being crushed or leaking. GM has since reinforced this area of the battery. To date there is not a single case of a Volt sparking or catching fire after a crash, besides this one where, for some reason, the car 's battery was not discharged like what the manual for the car says to do in a major crash. <p> Do you honestly think a battery with tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas? <p> Do n't just crash, but stick a piece of iron into a Volt battery, turn it upside down, dowse it with anti-freeze and let it sit for days, or maybe even weeks, upside down. <p> This is Forbes. It used to be about Capitalist Tool. I 'll venture Forbes Senior would never have gone as far as Fox News, and many others to miss-inform about the Volt. And as much as I 've doubted the son being made of the same cloth, I will take as a sign that his allowing Mr. Lutz some space in this magazine means there 's hope. <p> duh!... " the most celebrated example of American engineering of the last 30 years " <p> duh! 1835 American Thomas Davenport was credited with building the first practical electric vehicle..... <p> and today people are celebrating a car that can go forty miles on electricity..... <p> dang! I had tractors fifty years ago that ran propane but do you see John Deere, International Case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volt that runs natural gas at today 's $1.90 a gallon price and leave the electric motor in the vacuum machine sucking up the ignorance in Washington D. C. among those jack@ and elephant 's that act like turnips. <p> madmilker, You are either ignorant, or being political or a combination of the two. The Volt does 40 miles on electricity, but also does 100 mph. If you think it is so easy, build one yourself and find out. I have seen people spend $20,000 on modifying electric bicycles. This is very expensive stuff and adds up real fast. I am ok with natural gas, but why not push for both? You know Obama is pushing for natural gas also. Maybe you should start bashing natural gas also? With a Chevy Volt, I can buy 4 solar panels with a grid tie DIY kit for $1500, it will compensate for half of the electricity used in a Volt. The energy made by the solar panel is credited at 0.14+ cents per KWh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.07 cents per KWh. So the solar panels will compensate 100% of the cost of driving a Volt. Free driving. Try that with natural gas! <p> The only way to understand is to find your own " balanced news ". Watch Faux News if you must, but in order to get accurate news you must also read the " other side ". One of the reasons for the Tea Party, Beck, Palin, Limbaugh and, yes, the Volt issues is that people only get their information from one clearly biased source. This creates what I call " low information voters " and it is destroying our country. Do n't lose faith, Bob... just expand your world and embrace the difference of opinions. Hundreds of credible sources are extolling the virtues of the Volt -- just turn off Fox and Rush and see what the rest of the world thinks. I promise you that your world will seem brighter. Today, there was an article about the Canadian 's refusing to air Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in broadcasting news. <p> It was because of " low information voters " that Obama got elected and the Volt was pushed onto the market too soon, in order to force a green agenda. Why battries, why not natural gas, it is abundant and is cheap and burns clean. If you are so smart look into what the cost is to the enviorment to smelt these so called green energy battries. They poison the earth ten times more that a clean burning gas engine will. Also, take the toyota prious, another green car, which is better than the volt. But, it has a larger carbon footprint than a H2 hummer. The facts are out there, you just have to be an informed individual, not a lib or conservitive, just a good steward of your environment. <p> If we 're " low information voters ", you who dwell on HuffPo, WaPo, NYT, MSNBC, et al, are clueless voters. You do n't get any balance, just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media. To quote you, " Do n't lose faith,( suzier)... just expand your world and embrace the difference of opinions. " In other words, you need to get out of your parents ' basement, clear your brain, and realize that you are being fed lies and libdope. <p> Well, I 'm on the left side of life, and I own a Nissan LEAF( because you-all decided not to target Seattle as a Volt initial market), BUT, the United States needs rational people in BOTH parties to speak out against all the lies and acts of insanity. For example I have " environmental " friends who hate coal, natural gas, wind, and hydro power, but who then refuse to install solar on their household, and who refuse to even replace their light bulbs with CFLs. Well hello, and where do you think the power is going to come from??? <p> So, please dear God BE a conservative, but make sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frauds in your own party -- and especially speak the scientific and engineering truths where those are knowable -- and NOT " politically correct " humbug! <p> James makes a good point here ; whether you tend to lean to the left or the right, YOU have the ultimate responsibility to " check the facts " and from multiple sources too! It takes some work, but jst as you would n't want anyone to pre-chew your food for you, do n't just swallow information blindly either, no matter where it comes from! ANY new technology comes with some risk, but it is the price you pay to be on the forefront! <p> I have bad news for you. The Volt is n't the only thing conservative media insists on lying about. " Lying " is a strong word, but as you pointed out, clearly the people saying those things have to know better, so what 's the conclusion? If you start fact-checking thee guys, you 're going to find yourself routinely frustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned. <p> Exactly who is lying about the Volt? This car is n't selling- period. It is extremely expensive for a little four passenger car about the same size as a Honda Civic that only gets forty miles on a battery charge. This is almost exactly the same range that the original electric cars got on a battery charge way back in the early 1900? s. Battery technology remains a problem, until range is extended electric vehicles will remain a boutique environmental statement for the well healed financially. Too bad the taxpayers have to subsidize a vehicle that only the 1% can afford to purchase and drive. <p> Bob, Do n't give up the fight. You and GM are to be congratulated. Finally, after four decades a U.S. manufacturer has out-engineered the European and Asian auto companies. Americans should be celebrating, not demeaning the accomplishment. As for the FoxNews crew, you 're right -- the only conclusion can be reached is that they are intentionally lying. I am a Republican. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There is just too much oil money supporting my party. My annual savings from : no gasoline, no oil changes, no air filters, no 12v battery replacements, no transmission fluid changes, etc. more than makes up for the difference between the VOLT cost( net after tax credit of $36,500) and a comparable gas-powered sedan in less than 4 years. That 's assuming $3.75 per gallon -- at $5.00 / gallon, the additional outlay for the VOLT evaporates in less than 3 years. After that, it 's all money in my pocket. Why is n't the car selling? Simple : slow sales are normal at this early stage in the life cycle of a product that is so different. Sadly most potential buyers of new-concept products are wimps. They wo n't have the nerve to buy one until their neighbor has one. Keep defending the excellent automobile that you and GM have created. It will be named car of the century some day. <p> Ridiculous, I love the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans suggested GM fail. It was former President Bush who ammended the Tarp regulations meant for financial instutions only, and gave the auto industry 17 million of so when he ended his term. The decision kept them afloat with Obama having the last word. The Republicans suggested a managed bankruptcy, which is exactly what Obama did except for one fact. He thru the GM shareholders and Main Street Bondholders under the bus, and violated contract law in doing so, for the favor of the UAW, and for labor votes. Chapter 11 in effect cancells all prior contracts. They had their chance to wipe the slate clean, and start without debt. Now they are once again over 22 Billion in the hole with GM 's labor agreements. <p> The Chevy Volt was 1st seen in 2007 Obama was not in office. President Bush was on vid saying it 's a good thing to cut off oil from overseas. Also Fox News did a story from the North American Auto Show where the car debut. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinda cool care &; help the US get off oil from the Middle East " that was back in early 07. That vid has now been removed from the internet youtube no longer has it &; fox news archives have no searches for " For Host like new Volt ".... Funny huh? I own one it 's great I have not put gas in it for going on 9 weeks now.. so HA! <p> Mr. Lutz, You can throw up a strawman with the best of them. I know it 's easy and convenient for you to default to the lowest common denominator( Volt fires) as everything that is wrong with GM, but I contend that there are plenty of reasons Americans are furious with your company -- chief among them, that Government Motors should have been allowed to fail... That 's right FAIL. You say you 're a conservative, but you have little faith in the most important facet of conservatism which is faith and belief in the market. Sure, it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going great and your company is making money, but what about when you overextend? What about when your entire cost structure is out of whack with astronomical labor costs and concessions to the UAW? Then... Not so much I guess. The market is supposed to discipline bad business decisions. In GM 's case it did n't. The federal government was right there to make sure that profits were privatized and losses were socialized... That 's not being conservative... That 's not a free market.... There 's a name for it, it 's called mercantilism. As a conservative, you should know that, so please, no more op-eds on Forbes. They are tiresome and annoying. It 's not about the Volt fires and you know it... It 's about the worst sort of crony capitalism -- a plague that is quickly destroying this country. <p> BillyBob, Do n't disagree with any of your comments, but none of your points justify FoxNews commentators, or anyone else, lying about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of the spear that will help pop the oil price bubble once and for all. Sure, maybe GM should have gone backrupt, but it did n't, so does that mean we have to kill one of its great products to even the score? Does n't make sense. I have 11,000 miles on my VOLt and have used less than 40 gallons of gasoline. Why would anyone want this American car not to succeed? <p> GM did go bankrupt. They failed. I know, because I took a financial hit when my bonds were converted into shares of the new GM, and at a small fraction of their original value. <p> I can not understand how the right-wingers can consistently scream " GM should have been allowed to fail ", then immediately follow that up with demands that GM " pay back " the money that the treasury lost as a result of that bankruptcy. Either GM went bankrupt and the US treasury had their debts converted to an ownership stake in what you derisively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go bankrupt and my bonds were never converted for pennies on the dollar. <p> Your bonds were converted for pennies on the dollar because you as a bondholder took a back seat to the UAW and equity holders( thanks to government meddling by the way). As far as the " bankruptcy " is concerned, sure you can call it a bankruptcy if you 'd like, but it was managed by the government through and through. How many bankruptcies put shareholders in line ahead of bondholders unless the government is making the rules? How many bankruptcies give the bankrupt company a mulligan on their tax liabilities by allowing them to continue their " tax-loss carry forward, " under which GM can write off its past losses against future profits for years to come? In normal bankruptcies that does n't happen. The rule of law in Chapter 11 bankruptcies was completely upended to protect an inefficient company and an even more inefficient labor structure... But hey, blame it on right wingers if you want. <p> billybob, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything, do not want to mess it up. Will add, saw David Stockman and Bill Moyers of all people, together, in perfect synch, attacking this crony capitalism. The conservative objection to the Volt is not that it is an electric car, it is making the taxpayers and debt foot the bill, so please, please, ditch the strawmen, Lutz. If the Volt is such a great product, it will stand on its own. That is conservatism, free markets. Stop the subsidies at our expense! But still Mr. Lutz, you brought over the GTO. Plenary indulgence granted. <p> Thanks Bob Lutz for your efforts. I do n't blame you for giving up. I gave up on the republican party also, and I am more conservative than anyone on the planet. Hey, I want machine guns legalized. This tells you how far right I am, and I am totally disgusted with my own party. I know this is a first term president and politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have never seen politics spill over into bashing an American product. I will never vote republican again, until they stop this anti-American attacks on the Volt. I am voting for Obama, unless Trump or you Bob Lutz runs for pres. I really wish GM would just step up and defend themselves already. What Foxnews is doing goes beyond the 1st ammendment. Freedom of speech does not allow you to use it to hurt others with lies, they should get a nice lawsuit. Seriously, Bob Lutz I will vote for you as pres if you run. <p> So Bob Lutz comes out swinging for the Obama administration. Sure is getting very political around here. Maybe Lutz should address " The Chevy Volt, the car that had to be built ", but the car that very few want to buy. $7500.00 rebates for $41,000.00. A car that must use high test gas, and gets about 28 MPG when using gas. Instead of making this why this car is a revolutionary marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one wants to buy them except for G.E. and after all they are the ones that are building the charging stations with plenty of money to do so, as they do n't have to pay federal taxes on the 50 billion the made. Indeed crony capitalism is the issue here, and with Lutz whom you could say was old GM, the thinking that got the company in trouble in the first place. No one is buying the hype or the finger pointing and the sales figures prove it, Mt Lutz. <p> James, you are ignoring the fact that thousands of Americans have bought the Volt, and thousands more are waiting to get one. You also neglect to acknowledge the enormous cost of oil to society and our country. Why do you " conservatives " happily accept the trillions that have gone to subsidize oil all the while whining about a few billion going to a technology that will give patriotic Americans the CHOICE to use domestic renewable energy instead of mostly foreign oil? <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure is getting very political around here. Maybe Lutz should address " The Chevy Volt, the car that had to be built ", but the car that very few want to buy. $7500.00 rebates for $41,000.00. A car that must use high test gas, and gets about 28 MPG when using gas. Instead of making this why this car is a revolutionary marvel, Lutz points fingers at Fox and avoids the fact that no one wants to buy them except for G.E. and after all they are the ones that are building the charging stations with plenty of money to do so, as they do n't have to pay federal taxes on the 50 billion the made. Indeed crony capitalism is the issue here, and with Lutz whom you could say was old GM, the thinking that got the company in trouble in the first place. No one is buying the hype or the finger pointing and the sales figures prove it, Mr Lutz. <p> Let 's talk about the hundreds of thousands( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade that finally have a series of mass-market cars they can recommend for people to test drive and buy today. <p> The Volt is a fantastic vehicle... a really amazing amount of very intelligent engineering went into it. <p> I say this as an owner of FOUR electric vehicles. I have drive most of them for 5 years. <p> It always amazes me that the media and people in general always go to the negative. They look at this one non-issue and expand on it and it becomes and " I told you so " issue. <p> Be realistic! Many or the gas cars you believe to be " high-quality " cars were recalled in their first year of sales. Think the Lexus is amazing? Look at it 's recall history! And these were for legitimate problems. <p> You ca n't expect " joe public " to do anything but follow along with what the media focuses on. They do n't know and they do n't have the time to find the facts. <p> Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see many BMWs, Hondas and Mercedes, but 0 Volt fires! Why -- because there have been no real Volt fires but hundreds of thousands of other vehicle fires. Bad Karma or simple irony means some Volt naysayer will probably be involved in a car fire of their own soon. This too will be blamed on Obama. <p> Bob Lutz is voicing the same concerns as many Chevy Volt owners who happen to be Republicans too. They are noticing that the ones in the public eye who call themselves Republicans are very different from real-world Republicans. <p> That is, Republicans that own and drive Chevy Volts and love them for what they are. <p> A fantastic American innovation that will change automobiles forever. <p> All it takes is a test drive and you too will know the truth. <p> " The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself. " Plato <p> The Volt is the best car I 've owned. Handling, quality and acceleration of my BMW sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in most cars. After that 40 miles per gallon and the same performance. No regular maintenance costs or visits. Lease price less than a Toyota Camry hybrid. Buy price same after tax credits and It 's a much better car. It also does n't pollute the air at all except on a long trip. I feel sorry for everyone who puts their credit card in the gas pump slot and let 's the Oil Companies suck them dry. <p> My one year old Chevy Volt was hit broadside by a Chevy Tahoe two weeks ago. The airbags deployed, the doors are bashed in, we were n't hurt, the other guy 's insurance in paying for the repairs and I can not wait to get my Volt back. <p> I have commented often about this great car. It was conceived by GM before Obama, before the bailout, before today 's high gas prices. Mine has a lifetime average of 116 MPG. Performance is terrific. The ride is comfortable. After the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another five years, I will have saved $15,000 to $18,000 on gas. There is nothing not to like about this great American car. <p> A good chunk of that savings was my Navy Retirement that I had to pay back to the Federal Government in taxes. Your tax break is someone else 's tax burden. Pay full price for a Volt and tell me how much you love it while I nurse my 13 year old vehicle along. <p> I appreciate your service to our country. Please be more upset that much, MUCH, larger part of your your Navy Retirement is going to the $40+ billion in annual oil company subsidies. You should be more upset about this, and the fact that our boys( and gals) continue to be in harms way patrolling the Straits of Hormuz. Us Volt owners are helping to end all of that, so I accept your thanks for that. <p> To all of the naysayers and disparagers of the VOLT, Bob Lutz, and GM, some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up. Because with out doing so, you have no clue. This car is truly one of the great innovations of our time. Better yet, I 'll save you a trip to the Chevy dealership : just read the comments below by VOLT owners. Do you think these people are making this stuff up? I know that they are not -- I 'm one of them. <p> After reading some of the vitriolic comments about the Volt and the bailout, I have a question. How many of these caustic commentators get most of their information from Fox News or similar sources? I think it 's a fair question and the answers should give everyone something to think about. <p> One needs to have all of the information at hand when judging the veracity of comments. There are too many people running around yelling " Liar, liar, pants on fire! " and not considering the potential accuracy of the claims made. They also( like the author of this article) most notably do NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lies ". In the case of the Obama Administration 's energy policy, they just so happened to heavily subsidize the purchase of the Chevy Volt through tax credits and GM STILL failed to meet sales numbers. That 's my money going to buy a car I would n't want for other people I do n't even know... sorry, but I object to that policy of this Administration. And the President and his spokespeople have claimed that support of alternative energy usage and higher fuel economy in vehicles ARE a part of his ENERGY POLICY, so how is there a lie in Mr. Krauthammer 's statement regarding that? Oh, that right, the author of the article disingenuously twists the energy-policy comment into something about " Obama-conception " which had nothing to do with what Krauthammer said. Where 's the lie again?? And yes, after crash tests some Chevy Volts caught fire.. simple fact. You could look it up. That 's not to say that they will spontaneously combust, but neither did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't have known that from the press coverage. Portraying the Volt as " flammable " would n't be the MOST accurate statement, or the most fair, but it 's certainly not a lie, and well within the standards of journalism applied to the auto industry over the past half century.... like the coverage of Ralph Nader 's smear of the Corvair, the piling on to the Pinto, or intentional, faked pickup truck fires of more recent memory. Just because the Volt is " green ", and in compliance with the progressive agenda does n't mean it deserves some sort of media " pass " or favored treatment not afforded to other vehicles and projects no matter if it 's a liberal or a conservative reporting. <p> I will grant you that Krauthammer 's statement about the " flammability " of the VOLT is not a " lie ", but it certainly is not the " whole truth. " Krauthammer made no attempt to make it clear that no owner-operated VOLT has ever caught fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Nor did he offer a ' balancing ' comment that thousands of gas-powered vehicle fires, with injuries, occur every year. But whatever you call this mix of ' half truths ' or ' negative spins ' from FoxNews about the VOLT, the real story that underlies all of this that no one has addressed is : What is Fox 's motive for the anti-VOLT spin? Are we witnessing here the Fox News team following a directive from on-high( Rupert) as a favor to his close friends in the oil industry? <p> Mike -- please understand that there are a lot of Volt owners like myself who bought our Volts to stop sending money to our enemies, and not because it 's green. <p> I work as a contractor for a branch of the military, and on the days after 9/11 me and some other workers( some of who were servicemen) vowed to find a way to stop using so much oil. <p> In the 9 1/2 years after 9/11/01, before I bought my Volt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saudis. In the one year that I have had my Volt, my donation to the Saudis has dropped by over 90%. <p> If you want to continue support the people that knocked down those buildings, and killed those thousands of citizens on 9/11/01, I suppose that is your right. But I do n't understand how a Navy retiree can think that is a good idea. <p> Mike, to your comment " That 's not to say that Volts will spontaneously combust, but neither did the Ford Pinto back in the 70? s " <p> Just to note, the accident described below where a Volt with four occupants was rear-ended by a bus surely have caused a Pinto to catch fire. What happened to the Volt? While it was totalled, all occupants escaped unharmed, and there was n't so much as a whif of smoke from the Volt( although there was smoke from the bus). <p> " That initial impact was n't too bad... but then the bus hit us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a second where I was too scared to turn around and look at my kids. You could hear the bus 's engine IN the car... the car then filled with a burning rubber smell and smoke and it wobbled from side to side a bit. You could hear the tires chirping as the traction control held the car in a straight line until we were able to pull to the side. An amazing performance actually. It 's hard to remember the details, but we were probably going about 40 at the time of the impact. If we were in a SUV or another top heavy car, I felt we would have flipped over or completely lost control of the car. The Volt was really, really good and held mostly steady and straight. Onstar came on immediately after we stopped, just like in the commercials. " <p> Mike. The reality is that gas cars catch fire every day, 792 of them on average. One person is killed every day in a car fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were tested. Statistically that means that the gas car fires are much more likely to happen. So it is a non-issue and the fact that you bring it up shows your uninformed bias. Read jimnj 's comments for lots of personal Volt experience. They are selling like crazy in europe because they do n't have right wing extremists attacking the car to promote their agenda to link Obama( who is n't responsible for the Volt -- it was promoted by Bush) to the car so they can try and imply he 's wasting taxpayer money. <p> Forget the fires. It 's the performance and the outrageous cost. A $7 -10,000 tax " forgiveness " and the real cost of the prop, $250,000 per vehicle. It 's criminal activity by a criminal administration at the taxpayers ' expense. <p> that 7500 tax credit was written by that well known liberal Dick Chaney. and the cost per vehicle of 250k, is a big fraud. you might have more to stand on if you just pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do what was done to the Volt, you would also get a fire, and you get could an explosion. gasoline is a class explosive. they did n't follow instructions to secure the car. failure to do that will lead to problems, like fires. try doing the same thing to gas or diesel car and you will get the same result or worse <p> I concede the authors point that flammability is not a serious problem with the Volt. What is problematic is the cost of the vehicle and its limited range of 40 miles. The Volt is a triumph of central planning. The US taxpayers have lavishly subsidized an impractical toy that GM admits is purchased by buyers with an average annual salary of 175k. This is the Democrats idea of trickle up income redistribution? For the price of the Volt, sans the government subsidy, a wise buyer could purchase two Honda Civics and have enough left over to take a family vacation in my home state of Florida. <p> Lutz you putz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see that it is of course not just in this isolated incident that the right is dishonest and insane. it is in all matters. and you have spent your entire life being just as wrong as you are of course also completely wrong in your idiotic stance on global warming. you love for moronic US pony cars and SUVs and V8s is similarly wrong. those you despise on the ultra left are the righteous ones and always were. those who are good stewards of the earth, those who love the truth, those who care, those who think. it is of course not those who whore themselves to big oil, those who whore with satan and start wars based on obvious lies and kill millions of people while spending trillions you ca n't afford. <p> the true christian left is the correct stance. there are no christians on the right. no christian would ever support wars based on lies. you just managed to live all your life without ever thinking for a single moment. beastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you concluded global warming is a crock. and that 's how the right wing pundits work. I assure you they do n't know that they are lying. same as you do n't know you are lying when you say global warming is n't real. they are just mindless, just like you. <p> if you now at this late hour of your life should wisely choose to love the truth, take your first step by admitting that the Volt was born entirely from the shame of who killed the electric car and nothing else. then take a giant step to the left. then just maybe will you be allowed entry into heaven. but with your crimes it better be a bold declaration. <p> The right is stuck in their own ugly pit of negativity. Bob is right once people figure out that the right is just plain lying about the Volt maybe more people that watch the missinformation will start questioning it all. <p> I am a very happy right leaning Volt owner that is saddened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car for 6 months. Love how it drives love how I use very little gas. 115 MPG with 8K miles. Just took a 700 mile roadtrip with an average of 48 MPG, and thats in speeds 75+( I charged it 3 times) <p> Not even the Prius can do that. GM has created a great car and the right is so full of miss contempt that they even try to hurt their own country just so they can rant. Sad Sad Sad indeed. <p> I will give you the point that the Volt catches fires the day after the accident. But, you are missing the main point. Why is it the government 's business to push any technology? I do n't see it the government 's business to invest billions of dollars in the auto business to benefit GM. I want the government out of business. <p> To Gallagher and to epeon7. How is the government 's assistance to GM and the VOLT program different from the assistance provided to home owners via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? How many trillions of dollars has that government assistance totaled over the years? Or allowing oil companies to accelerate the deduction of drilling expenses in order to encourage more oil production? Billions more in expense for the government / taxpayers! Get real. The assistance to GM is insignificant by comparison. The investment in the VOLT program by GM and the government will lead to further battery innovations( already in the pipeline) and, like it or not, the program will, in the not too distant future, lead to lower oil/gasoline prices and savings for all car owners. <p> Most of the reporters that give negative comments about the Volt are masochists. They are anxiously expecting their imported vehicle to catch fire, but do n't want to get too burned so they can survive and complain about their incident. Well, Mr. Bill O'Reilly, your vehicle is ready to start a fire with you inside! <p> A crashed Volt battery will burn after two weeks. The car did n't. No Volt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torches it on purpose. <p> Today, the media will sensationalize a story regardless of political leaning. And most of the rest of the media will jump on the initial report, giving it a longer life than it ever deserved. Like Ray Donovan in New Jersey in the 80? s, the key question remains : where do you go to get your reputation back? <p> I 'm also guessing that Mr. Lutz would now sympathize a bit more with Toyota after everything they went through in the media a few years ago. <p> Today, the media will sensationalize a story regardless of political leaning. And most of the rest of the media will jump on the initial report, giving it a longer life than it ever deserved. Like Ray Donovan in New Jersey in the 80? s, the key question remains : where do you go to get your reputation back? <p> When electricity is generated in a large, stationary plant it is able to be very efficient( thanks to the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient than a piston engine) and then uses the exhaust( with a little reheating) for a steam turbine to gain more power from the same amount of energy. Electric vehicles are much more efficient than gasoline for this reason, using renewable energy to power them is just a bonus. <p> With all due respect, I am calling you a lier, here are the reasons : 1). GM battery scientist/engineer called Chevy Volt " Battery may not last 10y " " Ridiculous project ", so basically it is a project coerced by management for PR purposes, not for the REAL. Just as Dr. N**** and Mr. M***** at GM( name omitted here) 2). Everyone in the battery community have serious doubt about this, its high price and low customer acceptance. 3). GM is reportedly lose &gt;20K on each Volt sold, basically this is a product just to expensive to be viable, even with manufacturing advancement, battery will be too expensive, just ask Meneham Anderman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manufacture the Volt? with fixed cost such as equipment depreciation included? 4). I challenge you to contest my posting here! <p> Ca n't speak to points( 1),( 3) or( 4), but I challenge your suggestion in( 2) that customer acceptance of the VOLT is low -- this is false. This car has the highest customer acceptance rating of any car ever produced -- over 93%! Further, I do n't what battery community you are referring to that has ' serious doubts ' about the car, but there are battery development projects underway that will, in the not too distant future, be producing LI batteries capable of delivering 200-300 miles of range per charge. <p> Frank. I 'll contest your posting. GM has 7000 reservations in Europe for their version of the Volt( made at the same plant here in the US). This car is going to be a huge hit for GM everywhere but the US until people wake up and realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them commenting here) consider this the best car they have ever owned. So word of mouth will spread as more and more people actually drive them. Now that they are given priviledged status in the carpool lanes they will begin to really take off. As far as expense -- have n't you noticed the BMW 's, Lexus 's, Mercedes, and Cadillac 's on the road? People buy cars for a lot more than price. <p> More interesting than another refutation of the facts about the Volt is the sheer level of vitriol being poured on it from conservative media. That is something I 'm finding hard to come to terms with. Have these people forgotten that every single product of the space program was essentially financed by inefficient government procurement through NASA? <p> I 've written something much longer that New English Review has published. It might be of interest to those reading these comments : <p> Ahh, a basic truth of modern politics. The only thing you can know for sure are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else you are subject to influence by those with more power than you have. <p> Dear Mr. Lutz, I sympathize with your response to the falsehoods being spread about the Volt, but this is exactly the same kind of strategy employed to deny global warming : deny evidence, make up a fake reality, consult sham experts, and create yet another issue for a culture war. The false attacks on the Volt and the effort to deny global warming are two sides of the same coin. <p> From 2005.... General Motors Vice Chairman Robert Lutz said the automaker missed an opportunity to market itself as a technologically savvy company capable of producing hybrid vehicles. <p> Lutz said GM " missed the boat " on a marketing opportunity with hybrids -- an opportunity Toyota Motor Corp. has played to its advantage. " We business-cased it, took a hard, analytical look and thought the engineering and investment were irresponsible vis-a-vis our shareholders, " he said. " We failed to appreciate what Toyota has basically treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful the business case for hybrids would work. <p> In hindsight, " we should have said, ' We 'll lose $100 million a year on hybrids, but we 'll take our advertising budget of $3 billion, make it $2.9 billion and treat it as an advertising expense, ' " he said. While Lutz said he finds it hard to view product as a form of advertising, " Toyota very cleverly has used hybrids to gain an improved perception of the brand. " <p> Anyone who thinks that gas-electronic technology is not better than spending $100,000,000.00 for an oil tanker and $30,000,000.00 for an off shore oil rig that will only be around for 10-15 years is crazy. The rail roads have been using diesel-electric technology since 1965. Electronic motors have much, much more lugging/torquing power. If you do n't believe me pull out an electric drill or go to your local machine shop and see the electric motors that have been around for a long, long time. <h> Most Read on Forbes <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Korean and pre-Vietnam era. I received an MBA from UC Berkeley in 1962, with highest honors. I 've held top management positions at GM, BMW, Ford, Chrysler and retired from GM as Vice Chairman in 2010 at age 78. My two successful books are " Guts : The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler The World 's Hottest Car Company "( Jonn Wiley+Son, 1998) and, more recently, " Car Guys vs. Bean Counters : The Battle For The Soul Of American Business "( Portfolio Press, 2010). I 'm a CNBC contributor and appear with some frequency on " Larry Kudlow.
