5083941 <h> Romney Power Team Dissects 2012 Together in Tampa <p> After a somewhat anticlimatic start to the Republican National Convention because of weather delays, Mitt Romney and his Boston-based power team hit the ground today in Tampa, Fla., and are ready to make up for lost time. <p> In a rare public appearance together, Romney senior advisers Eric Fehrnstrom and Beth Myers, director of advertising Ashley O'Connor and pollster Neil Newhouse sat down together for an ABC News-Yahoo News! Breakfast, revealing what Mitt Romney really thinks about the ad wars and which blue states might, surprisingly, swing red. <p> The ad war waging in this year 's campaign has been expensive, brutal and, it turns out, irritating to the Republican nominee. When asked what ad most " got under his skin, " the answer was unequivocally " Understands, " an Obama-friendly super PAC ad that implicates Romney for the death of a man 's cancer-stricken wife. <p> " It was so over-the-top and just so blatantly false, " Myers said. " And they continued to put dollars behind it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so do n't believe the baloney about, ' Oh, we 're not airing the ad. ' " <p> Newhouse brushed off the fact check as par for the course in political campaigns. <p> " People are always going to get Pinocchios for this stuff, " Newhouse said. " We stand behind those ads and behind the facts in those ads. " <p> Newhouse suggested the problem was with the fact-checkers, not the facts themselves : " Fact-checkers come to this with their own sets of thoughts and beliefs and you know what? We 're not going let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers. " <p> Romney 's team made clear they intend to subsidize the ad war with earned media( publicity through editorial influence), campaigning and messaging in the battlegrounds. The column of battleground states, however, is expanding. <p> " Obama is basically playing defense, " Fehrnstrom said. " Every state that 's up for grabs is a state that he won four years ago. He has n't expanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blue states right now. " <p> Myers said, " We 're on an offense in states that they did n't think they 'd have to defend. " <p> Romney 's team highlighted Wisconsin, Michigan and Missouri as " toss up " states they feel confident they can take, but it wo n't be easy. <p> " It 's going to be tough battle, " Fehrnstrom said. " It 's going down to the last day. " <p> History and statistics suggest Fehrnstrom is probably right. Perhaps the single-most accurate predictor of which candidate will win the presidential race, the Gallup tracking poll 100 days out, recently showed Obama and Romney locked in a dead heat. <p> Got ta love those Tea Party supporters. I believe they would strap on explosives and detonate them just to get a few Dems. <p> Posted by : BikernAz12 August 28, 2012, 1:55 pm 1:55 pm <p> They have been trashing this president since day one. Mitch McConnell the next day after the election said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's that for working together? I would never vote GOP... and they are now taken over by the crazed Tea Party. They are the party of No, and want less government unless it pertains to women 's rights and gay rights. A Bible in one hand, a gun in another. <p> Posted by : Barb August 28, 2012, 1:55 pm 1:55 pm <p> " I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it. " " Roe v. Wade has gone too far. " <p> " I 've been a hunter pretty much all my life. " " Any description of my being a hunter is an overstatement of capability. " <p> " If Massachusetts succeeds in implementing it, then that will be a model for the nation. " " What works in one state may not be the answer for another. " <p> " It was not my desire to go off and serve in Vietnam. " " I longed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country there. " <p> " It 's a tax cut for fat cats. " " I believe the tax on capital gains should be zero. " <p> " It 's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person. " " He 's going to pay, and he will die. " <p> " The TARP program... was nevertheless necessary to keep banks from collapsing in a cascade of failures. " " When government is... bailing out banks... we have every good reason to be alarmed. " <p> " These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress. " " Republicans should never abandon pro-growth conservative principles in an effort to embrace the ideas of Al Gore. " <p> " Those... paying taxes and not taking government benefits should begin a process toward application for citizenship. " " Amnesty only led to more people coming into the country. " <p> " When I first heard of the Do n't Ask, Do n't Tell policy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Ask, Do n't Tell has worked well.
