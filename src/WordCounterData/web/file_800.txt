5107341 <p> At a recent dance concert, I happened to sit with the director of one of Chicago 's finest church music programs. Talk turned to choruses in town. " If I hear a performance, " the gentleman said, " either in person or on a radio broadcast, I can always tell if it 's the Grant Park Chorus prepared by Christopher Bell. It 's as if he has some magic dust he sprinkles on his singers that gives them this incredible precision. " <p> Talking with the singers themselves confirms that there is an intangible, almost magical component as there is with all great conductors. But the singers offer more. " He has the best ears in the business, " two of them told me. " He misses nothing and he knows how to communicate what he hears and what he wants to reach his goal. <p> Bell has also had the privilege of working with a strong institution and tradition. The Grant Park Music Festival is marking the 50th anniversary of its remarkable chorus with six major programs that put this 100-plus professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer concerts. <p> The efficient, flexible and tight ensemble has had only three directors in its half a century, including its founder, the legendary Thomas Peck. In 2001, Bell, Belfast-born and Scotland-trained and -based, followed Peck 's longtime assistant Michael Cullen after both men died prematurely in the 1990s. Bell has continued their inquisitiveness about the repertoire and brought even more puckish joie de vivre. Even while conducting two ostensibly solemn works last weekend, he managed to sport some shoes that glowed well into the seating area. <p> Thus far the season has held two world premieres commissioned for the group 's golden anniversary, Michael Gandolfi 's silly " An Exaltation of Place " in June, which fizzled -- in its composition, not its execution -- and Sebastian Currier 's complex and subtle " Sleepers and Dreamers " earlier this month which scored with the audience and critics alike and is sure to be picked up by other organizations. Chicago linchpin Cedille Records has issued the first a cappella disc from the chorus, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choral works, " to enthusiastic reviews. And Grant Park artistic director and principal conductor Carlos Kalmar 's similarly excellent orchestra was doing first-rate work behind the Pavilion at the Harris Theater accompanying the Paris Opera Ballet 's successful engagement there. Plus, selected members of the chorus even did their fine Broadway-babies part in the big Frank Loesser tribute concertsearlier this month. <p> Kalmar will lead two more major works with the chorus in August, both cantatas : Haydn 's " The Seasons "( 10-11) and a Dvorak rarity, " The Spectre 's Bride "( 17-18) to close the season. <p> Over the weekend, Bell himself was on the podium for Rossini 's unusual and thrilling, almost hourlong " Stabat Mater " and a 1978 work by one of Bell 's Edinburgh mentors, the late Briton Kenneth Leighton. <p> After his retirement from most composition, Rossini wrote this rarely solemn setting of a very solemn liturgy in two chunks, 1831-32 and 1841, as a commission-favor for an influential Spaniard. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mourning Mary standing at the cross and requires a disciplined choir as well as four well-matched soloists ; key sections are unaccompanied. Bell had all of these Friday evening. Chicago soprano Jonita Lattimore, debuting mezzo Jennifer Holloway, Lyric Ryan Center tenor star Rebe Barbera and bass-baritone Ryan McKinny, another local debutant, handled individual solos, duets and quartets with care and naturalness -- and ears, evident in the singers ' easy blending. McKinny was especially noteworthy for his comfortable turns in both baritone and low bass registers. All four singers are testimony to the high level of training the top national opera apprentice programs are providing young American talent. <p> The Leighton performance was most noteworthy for the spectacular diction that is a hallmark of this chorus, Try singing, or even speaking, " through which the multitudinous monads are bound together, " a typical passage in the silly and pompous text by the French 20th century Catholic quasi-mystic Teilhard de Chardin. The evening opened with Rossini 's 1829 " William Tell " Overture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It
