It 's considered being very rude. If you feel this strongly about something, use all bold letters. <p> Alan <p> They wanted to leave because it was extremely cold. They did not want to leave because they disliked Romney. They were obviously there for Romney, then when it got cold and late, they wanted to leave. However, they were not allowed, for whatever reason. <p> Moderator3 <p> Should I have posted my reply in some other language than English? I was writing about capital letters, not cold or Romney. <p> yestradamous <p> I suspect the real story, because there 's ALWAYS more to the story, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave from a specific gate, because it was too close to the entrance to the stage, but there were 6 other ways out of the place they were free to take. <p> So sick of the lying. Republicans are so mean they want frost bitten children. So stupid. <p> MimiReed1234 <p> Except that the real story was posted later -- the staffers immediately led the people who wanted to leave out through unsecured exits. And no, there was n't any danger of frostbite. <p> KZ <p> We can not let you leave the line for the Gas Chambers. Because were Nazis. <p> bearclawws <p> I was there with a friend and we had a great time. Did n't have any problems or see anyone have any problems. Weird. @jfkucinich is a reporter covering politics for USA Today, that might explain it. But in her defense I studied her tweets. She said this, " People are literally sneaking out gates now bring told they ca n't leave way pic.twitter.com/uvlPBys5 but if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took with a negative tweet for evidence, does n't really show anyone doing anything but people standing. <p> michaelj72 <p> sounds like PA is going to go for mittomney big time after something like this. not. <p> http : **29;2804;TOOLONG karmanot <p> 500 + comments. Looks like Kolob trolls are on the roll. <p> http : //twitter.com/dandi56 James Darley <p> I love how this story has been debunked six-ways-to-sunday yet libs are still posting about it as if it 's the Gospel. Tomorrow they 'll be asking, " ZOMG, why is n't Eric Holder investigating this??!??!?!! " <p> LOL <p> tobyspeeks <p> Like all you fox news parrots and the George Soros story? And btw, this story has n't been debunked except by you paid for commentators who post your hate filled lies all over the internet to force what you believe on to others. Get your head out of the sand you self righteous moron. <p> http : **28;2835;TOOLONG Dianne Smith <p> Seems to be posted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the background of the video taken inside of what looks like a city office, there is a Sherrod Brown poster. Nice tryAnd I am sure Mothers would dress their kids for the weather duh <p> Dhickman20 <p> Why is anyone surprised at the arrogance( what cold?) or the desperation( stay until you freeze to death) on the part of republicans especially when Romney is in charge? <p> Blueclearsky <p> so let me get this straight... Romney has an unbelievably successful rally in PA -- then the Jackie( daughter of the kooky Dennis Kucinich) tweets that people are being held against their will at the rally and we are supposed to believe it? Really? Dems are losing it srsly! <p> r3verend <p> Well its Romney. It fits in the bigger picture of how he is acting so why should people really question it? <p> Blueclearsky <p> so let me get this straight... Romney has an unbelievably successful rally in PA -- then the Jackie( daughter of the kooky Dennis Kucinich) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rally and we are supposed to believe it? Really? Dems are losing it srsly! <p> Let them eat cake -- or freeze to death. If they ca n't take it then they are inferior and deserve the frostbite. <p> Williard <p> http : **25;2865;TOOLONG George McGinnis <p> I wonder how many Romney supporters at this rally will now vote for Obama tomorrow after a taste of how Romney will be treating them if elected ; left for dead out in the cold. <p> http : **29;2892;TOOLONG Heather Perkins <p> well, I hope they did n't vote early <p> Jake <p> Wrong. I was at the event. My friends were at the event. Yeah, it was cold, but low 40s is not considered " frostbite " weather. Moreover, the spot at which my friends and were they gladly let out anyone who asked. Either the writer experienced what was the anomaly or the writer ca n't come to terms with the fact that Romney just might win tomorrow. Probably both. <p> Jake, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it seems to me that people would only be at this rally if they supported Romney. So your explanations are specious, at best. But I would n't expect anything else from a Romney-bot. <p> Kelsy <p> Even if it WAS N'T that cold, it is still wrong to hold people -- especially children, in like that and refuse to let them leave when they are asking to leave. And you, I 'm assuming, are either a teenager or an adult and therefore will not experience hypothermia or frostbite as quickly as small children will. Do some research. <p> bornagaindem <p> sadly even those with frostbitten children will probably still vote for Romney <p> Lyssi4 <p> Thats Mitt Romney for you, total ass <p> LanceThruster <p> I 'm Mitt Romney... and I approve this indefinite detention. <p> Confus <p> The GOP 's notion of " freedom " -- <p> - caging citizens and children to make a Republican candidate look more popular. <p> Contemptible creatures those Republicans be. <p> big pun! <p> im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they did! but it back fired and thats what ya get when you go to a rally for romney republicans just suck! <p> Heywood Djablomi <p> AH HA HA HA HA HA!!!!! A hugely positive and historic rally happens for a Republican candidate and you immediately see a Gulag! AH HA HA HA HAAAA!!! Is to detract from the 95% drop in Obama 's crowds? Even the Boss could n't get the same crowds he gets in Chicago for Obama. Pathetic. <p> http : **30;2923;TOOLONG? id=1... Rachael Lin <p> I was at this rally. This ' news ' story is complete garbage. People were leaving early all around me. Yes, it was cold. Frostbite? Not a chance. Everyone was allowed to leave whenever they wanted. Stop the lying. <p> Confus <p> Rachel Lin - <p> Is it possible that in a stadium different gates were being handled differently and you just did not see the events described? <p> Or are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Confus -- <p> Is it possible that people were exagerating the entire event? <p> Or are you going to spread a lie about how much these reports personally witnessed? <p> ErrorTime <p> You know that kids do get colder faster and easier than you right? Why else would you see a five year old with a heavy winter coat while the parent wore something much lighter. And I 'm sure after standing outside for hours on end will take it 's toll on you. Being frostbitten at 42 degrees is highly unlikely but spend enough time outside, and yes it will happen. How about you stop pointing the finger at the " liars " and get educated about the human body? <p> ErrorTime=idiot <p> wow you are telling rachael to " get educated ".... Frost bite only occurs in temperatures below freezing( take into account the wind as well) and this was not nearly the case in PA lol, this whole thing is a joke... <p> the mother may have indeed said " my daughter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will respond the same way you did to rachel 's response... " how do you know what happened, you couldnt have seen everything ", <p> Fleur <p> With that kind of attitude, you practically refuse to acknowledge ANY news they shove to your face, because, hey, " I did n't see it myself, that could be untrue! " <p> Snarki, child of Loki <p> Kindly apply that same standard to religion. <p> ajcarpy2005 <p> Frostnip, the first stage of frostbite( not permanent damage) will occur before more serious damage. It is still uncomfortable feeling. Frostbite/Frostnip can start occuring after long periods of time in higher temperatures but if it 's really cold will happen faster depending on the starting core temperature, how much fat mass you have, how large you are, how many layers you have on, the wind chill, etc. <p> GrumpyDave <p> Of course, mom may have actually meant " hypothermic ", which does not require sub-freezing temperatures. I 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 59 years, and I 've seen cases of hypothermia in what I would consider rather mild conditions. One can become hypothermic and not realize it, and it can be very dangerous. A parent concerned over their child 's well-being may not always choose the right words. <p> I was n't at the event, so I do n't know whether people were actually retained or not. I did hear that Governor Romney was very late to his own rally -- although it was due to weather-related flight scheduling problems. <p> Kelsy <p> When the mother asked to leave, she should have been allowed to leave. Whether or not she was " lying " about her daughter being frostbitten. It has more to do with the fact that people were not allowed to leave, and I think people are trying to ignore that by calling others liars. Stop for a second and actually use your brain, guys. No matter what the weather situation was, NO ONE should have been told they could not leave if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body temperature are different from adults ' body temperature. PEACE! <p>... <p> NO SHIT... but it would still have had to been below 32 degrees for frostbite to have taken place for any humanbheing.... PEACE! <p> Cold is not the question here... since when ca n't you leave a ralley when ever the hell you want to... <p> Jaye Powell <p> Temperature was 42 when Romney arrived. Hardly weather to have been frostbitten. Dems lying as usual. <p> http : **27;2955;TOOLONG Chris Bowen <p> Temp does not matter, all that matters is if you are in the cold long enough for your core temp to drop low enough. You may not get frostbitten, but parents have a history of overreacting when it comes to their kids, but it is very possible for a kid in 42 degree temp to get hypothermia. <p> Kyle <p> But hypothermia is very very possible and since when is is ok to force people to say at a rally? If i want to leave a political rally for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so and no one has the right to tell me I ca n't. <p> Confus <p> What was the wind-chill factor? How long were the children exposed? What were the children wearing? When did the children last consume something? <p> Do n't know the answers do you? That 's because you Republicans are inveterate liars. <p> http : //www.dregstudios.com Brandt Hardin <p> You wo n't be able to get out of the nightmare of a Romney presidency either if you have been duped into voting for him. Is there any doubt a Romney administration would favor the rich and increase the income gap in our country? Mitt is a pariah in Mormon Clothing and will stop at nothing to expand an empire of greed for the rich in this country by expanding tax cuts for the 1% of the wealthiest Americans. He 's out to gut the Middle Class for every red cent he can get. Will his sacred Mormon underwear grant him the protection and money to buy this election? See for yourself as Mitt dons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http : **35;2984;TOOLONG... <p> X2Reload <p> This is DemoCRAP, Dennis Kucinich 's daughter reporting this.

" No need to be snotty about it. I am very aware of the way the republicans are treated differently by the police as well as the way democrats or better yet, liberals are treated. I think many of the police ARE republicans. <p> Confus <p> It is called " false imprisonment.

IJS. <p> Confus <p> Republicans voters, especially the Christian fundamentalists, tend to be extremely deferential to authority. <p> One of the most important reasons Republicans attend dogmatic churches and vote Republican is a compelling need to have authority figures tell them how to live their lives. <p> jessekanner <p>... while at the same time believing they are ' free '. It 's perfect. <p> http : **30;3053;TOOLONG? id=1...

All the people there were cheering and almost jumping out of their skins with excitement. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barry rally, after clinton spoke, people all started leaving about 1/3 through barry 's hate speech. <p> Celebrant <p> Keep in mind the people trying to leave were Repuglicans. No Democrat worth his weight in salt would attend a Romney rally. <p> KMAN <p> You 're wrong, most of the people I work with are lifelong democrats( chicago) ; they 're voting for Romney. If my coworkers voted for barry last time, they are n't admitting to it. <p> Do you think that Romney 's prospects will be improved If you and the people you work with in Chicago vote for Romney? <p> Unfortunately, for Chicago, you live there. Fortunately for America, you are not voting in Colorado. <p> Has it occurred to you, " Kman, " that your co-workers have not told you they voted for Obama because they are afraid you will go 2nd Amendment postal when Romney loses? <p> tommo <p> Wow, you said " Barry 's only drawing about 3% the crowd that Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your Murdoch propaganda / hate radio bubble now and then for air. Obama 's rallys are much bigger than Mitt / Lyin '. <p> birdmechanical <p> Some people being excited does n't mean that there were n't other people wanting to get out and not allowed to. <p> Whatever you think of NYTimes, USA Today is not really a liberal paper. <p> Just let some facts be facts. Just go, hey, do n't do that staffers, and move on. You do n't have to be politically defensive about this. <p> Confus <p> Kman, you said : <p> " all " and " 3% " <p> Evidently, you are a novice Republican troll. Skilled liars do not quote quantities that are patently impossible. <p> big pun <p> you idiot they where jumping out of their skins because they were probably freezing to death! you republicans are in such denial about how stupid and ignorant you are... you just suck! <p> Deborahlchamberlain <p> That would not happen at an Obama rally : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People NOT SEE the posts made by People that were actually there???? They said this is a TOTAL Lie, they were there at this event and anyone and everyone that wanted out could get out any time they wanted to. Listen I am not voting for Romney but You People would believe just about anything, My Lord, what Boobs you all are. If you read the sky was pink because Obama said it was ; would you believe it? I am Voting for Neither Liars, nor Cheats and am Voting for Gary Johnson. Both Romney and Obama are both Idiots. You Liberal mindless automatons think Obama is great, but Obama Started an Illegal War with Libya, Obama is killing lots and lots of Innocent people in Pakistan with his Drone Bombs. Romney is just a Plain Plutocrats intent on burying the Poor and Middle class. But you are all laughable if you believe this story about not being allowed to leave a Rally... LMAO... at least 5 people have posted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, no wonder we keep getting Idiots elected to the Presidency! <p> Proud Gay American <p> This is my opinion. Obama has helped many purple andI was one of them( Not talking about the Northeast problems) When he did the stimulus package, i got a big tax break and will a good income tax check. When i lousy my job i got unemployment, Obama gave me stimulus checks so I 'm very thankful! <p> Now as far as the Northeast is concerned. If you were strictly told to evacuate and you did n't, that 's your own fault and in my opinion the last to be helped especially on the coast of all these states! Now with you saying you do n't want no ones help except your community, Goodluck trying to build without the governments money. If you talked so much about the Presidents and you do n't get help then that 's your fault. Karma is teaching you a lesson. Most of you do n't like him because he 's black. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with these stupid Americans who have there heads up there butt, who is filled with hate and a, lot of them are religious freaks. Btw I 'm an American so as an American this country disgust me, the people do. You want so much but if it 's not the change as you want it, you bitch! If you 're so unhappy then leave this Country.

Was there a security issue that required the guards to block anyone 's exit?

Badly handled, though. <p> http : **31;3145;TOOLONG Wia Beshar <p> i think if it was a matter of just finding an appropriate exit or something, this wouldnt be an issue. i think the more pertinent thing is that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to leave in the same manner <p> Zzzzzzz <p> Aravosis acting like it 's the Apocalypse based on five tweets by two journalists. This kind of laughable hyperbole might be good enough for professional progs but it 's not good enough for people with functioning brains. <p> Jen L <p> People with functioning brains wait to form an opinion until they see more facts. You, on the other hand, decided that this is hyperbole before more facts are in, then attacked a group as gullible and stupid. <p> Oh and by the way, " acting like it 's the Apocalypse based on five tweets by two journalists? " Nice hyperbole. <p> You might want to look up " projection.

You might a dictionary yourself, friend. <p> MyrddinWilt <p> I suspect that most of the people posting in this thread to blame the parents are not parents themselves and have no idea what is involved. Kids have absolutely no common sense and trying to look out for all their wants is a full time occupation. Modern kids have to be fed snacks and given water, they demand sys-admin help for their electronics, they insist on wearing the pink dress or they throw a tantrum. <p> Oh and you are not allowed to hit or slap them any more, use of a taser is right out. <p> If I took my kids to a rally I would expect to be able to take them home any time I choose. ANY TIME. If someone tried to stop me I would call the police right then and there. Call 911, say that you are being held against your will and I guarantee that there is going to be a reaction.

Romney is an excellent example of this, too. He stands up for the right of free speech! Why, one day he 's against abortion, which is his right to say, and the next day, he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> #AMERICA! <p> Nope nobama is still a dope! <p> and I am suppose to want people to support the murder of innocent babies.... I have NEVER seen a fetus that was pro abortion. I do not believe Romney has ever supported the forcible expulsion of babies from their momma 's womb.... here is a concept : use a condom..... and stop killing innocent babies. Liberal logic kill baby 's in momma 's womb and keep child molester 's and child killers free to rape and kill more kids.... liberals are really scary <p> Snooznlooz <p> To " Nope nobama still a dope " " I do not believe Romney has ever supported the forcible expulsion of babies from their momma 's womb " Then you need to check out SteriCycle, a company Romney had controlling interest in and made millions from that provided services to abortion clinics. They cremate aborted fetuses and Mitt rakes in the profits. Could be why he wo n't release his tax returns! <p> Nope obama is still a dope <p> Yes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release his college transcripts because they prove he was kenyian born and muslim... and got scholarships based upon both of those facts DUH <p> MeowMix <p> Ok, so on one hand you 're complaining about how devastating the storm damage in your area is and that you have not received any help so far. So, how exactly did you make it all the way out to this rally in Pennsylvania with your four kids? Did you use the fuel that the Obama administration sent to hard-hit areas( like mine, btw, I live in NY and yea, we got some fuel trucks out here) or did Romney personally send out his caravan to bring you and your kids out there to freeze in the cold and pose as props at HIS rally instead of freezing in your house with no heat? C'm on, pick one story already! <p> Shore Thing <p> stock piles of gasoline.... in my shed..... lol... and lol it was not freezing. and btw I have heat it is called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in my community. I am certain you have at least a high school education and you can comprehend that... right? <p> Amused <p> This is coming from someone who 's name tag is the title of Snooki 's book... <p> MyrddinWilt <p> So you now claim to be hoarding fuel that your neighbors could have used and posing a fire hazard to your neighbors. <p> Romney really needs to raise his game and start hiring more intelligent comment trolls. <p> Shore Thing <p> Yvonne, we are not complaining that he has n't done anything to help. We are complaining because he used our state 's devastation for a photo-op and he continues to LIE. He never wanted to help the shore because we are a conservative community and he could care less..... what he should not have done was lie to the country and say he was gon na help and then not do it. NEWSFLASH.... WE ARE JERSEY STRONG AND WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN!!!! Church 's are helping, people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states have come in to help... the federal government MIA!!! <p> http : **29;3178;TOOLONG Lauren Rankin <p> I live on the Jersey Shore and I must say, in this case, no : we ca n't take care of our own. Communities have been decimated. Whole blocks are gone. Houses are destroyed. PEOPLE HAVE DIED. To assert that we do n't need the help of the federal government because we " take care of our own " is nothing short of offensive. To my friends who lost their house, they 're not relying on a church. THEY NEED FEMA. THEY NEED GASOLINE. THEY NEED HELP. The morale boost from President Obama being here was huge. My community cheered that a president is putting his money where his mouth is and is dedicated to helping us. <p> This Jersey Strong mentality is fine, but when a climate-change disaster of this proportion devastates an entire state, the federal government is not only needed, but desperately wanted. Wake up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. The truth is obama used helping us as a photo-op and has not come through with any help. The only help so far is people, churches etc.... try to get FEMA to help you... haha what a joke. Get a grip because just wait and see what he does n't do.... look at staten island.... those poor folks are not being helped either. WE as a community at shore have lost and there is no help from FEMA for us!! no credit cards for food we do n't have, no help with gas, NOTHING!! WAKE UP!!!!!!! <p> http : **29;3209;TOOLONG Lauren Rankin <p> Look, you obviously have a lot of hatred for our president, so no matter what he does, you 're going to hate him. At this point in time, we need to come together not just as a community, but as a country. We need federal support and anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves. <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thousands of gallons of gas. That, along with the gas rationing, are why the lines are significantly shorter. Secondly, FEMA is providing temporary apartments and hotel rooms, FREE OF CHARGE, for those who lost their homes. This is not just talk. A friend of mine actually received this help. Thirdly, even our Romney surrogate Governor Chris Christie has applauded and praised the President 's response to Sandy. What do you make of that? These are called facts, Shore Thing. Facts. I 'm curious what you would have thought if Romney had come and taken a " photo-op " tour of the devastation, rather than holding a " relief rally " in Ohio. I 'd rather have a leader who comes here, sees what the damage is, talks to people. Call me crazy, but that 's leadership. <p> Shore Thing <p> Romney is not President yet... one more day. No help has come through that is a LIE. You spew all the lies you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help coming through so far has been from the local community and say whatever the hell you want.... I live here and I have seen, watched and heard. I do n't like liars so obviously I do n't like obama, case closed. <p> Abcd <p> Ignore Shore Thing, his job as a political shill ends tomorrow. He 's just sad about it. <p> SillyMe <p> You seem to have a pretty decent internet connection there Shore Thing. You sure you 're in Jersey? Oh wait, maybe you 're still at that rally for Romney. <p> Jen L <p> Wait, you do n't like liars so you like Romney? <p> BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA that man gets busted lying several times per day and has stated that he wo n't let his campaign be dictated by something as silly as " fact checkers. " <p> With all of the conflicting information that you 've given in the last few posts, as well as all of the misinformation in your last few posts, you 're either : blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do mean terrible as in low quality) completely delusional <p> http : **29;3240;TOOLONG Lauren Rankin <p> I 'll be sure to let my friend whose house in Belmar was destroyed that the hotel room FEMA paid for her to stay in is a lie. <p> I 'm a college student and my mom is battling cancer. Without the help of government programs like pell grants and the protection that " obamacare " gives( Both to be cut by Romney by the by) my mother would n't be on the road to recovery and I would n't have the opportunity to pursue higher education. <p> So please, turn off Fox News and go find a more neutral news source sometime before the elections tomorrow. <p> tsuki <p> You are a liar. No wonder you are a Romney/Ryan supporter. <p> Geraldwalsch <p> I do n't believe Romney would have any place in a disaster area unless he were there to volunteer time and sweat to the recovery efforts. The President has a responsibility to tour the site and see first hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs to send in. Whether people like it or not( and I 'm sure the President does n't no matter who the President is at the time) the press( with cameras) follow him everywhere he goes. I ca n't say whether he treats this tour as a " photo op " or not because I 'm nowhere near the inside. All I can say for sure is that I expect a President to work, and touring disaster sites that require his attention is part of that. I know that when he is doing his job that the press will be there snapping photos, asking questions, and probably getting in the way during the process. Do n't get me wrong, I 'm not telling anybody how to feel about President Obama or trying to tell you that your opinion of the man is wrong. I do n't have that right. I just hope that you look at the world, and the people in it( The President included) with an open mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President touring New Jersey because he thought it would be great for his bid for re-election, or are there photos of him touring New Jersey because the press thinks they need to be attached to his hip( again, no matter who the President is at the time) every time he takes a step? For my part, I think it 's because the press is obnoxiously obtrusive, but I accept that I could be wrong. <p> Extreme Moderate <p> No, they did n't ship in thousands and thousands of gallons of gas. They shipped in over 30 MILLION gallons. <p> My girlfriend 's family lives in NJ, and a tree went through the house next to theirs. Yesterday a crew removed it. Estimated it at 75,000 pounds. And they got power back yesterday. That 's pretty damn good response, considering the extend of damage. Some people get help earlier than others. That 's ALWAYS the case, unless you have sufficient disaster crews to immediately deploy to ever street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be early winners and late losers. <p> tsuki <p> That is a GREAT response. After Elena, Mother was without electricity for two weeks, but, that was in 1975 and the responses were slower. <p> MeowMix <p> Right, and Paul Ryan was actually " cleaning " those pots and pans.( look it up) <p> Geraldwalsch <p> I hope that you do n't misconstrue the intention of this reply as a way of supporting the President or defending his impotence. I 'm posting strictly to give factual analysis of WHY FEMA is slow to react during natural disaster events. FEMA was it 's own agency with a cabinet level administrator( meaning direct access to the President) before the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and it was good at what it did. When DHS was formed many of our agencies were rolled into DHS and became departments of DHS. FEMA is one of those agencies. FEMA lost it 's direct access to the president to the DHS Director. FEMA also lost much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for terrorist disasters( these are more commonly known as technological disasters) such as the events of 9/11/2001. FEMA is really a department of DHS now. DHS is who is failing the Sandy victims right now by not allowing FEMA to operate the best way it knows how and by not budgeting resources for the priorities that FEMA is responsible for. I know this information does n't help you keep warm or feed your families, but understanding why something is the way it is and how it happened( President Bush started the DHS and rolled all those agencies into it as well as prioritizing terrorism preparation over everything else) can make you more enlightened as you decide who to blame for not receiving aid you need( Hurricane Katrina victims are familiar with this) and questions to ask about what the candidates will do to fix this in the future. Again, I 'm not trying to be biased at all or promote one candidate over another. Yes, President Bush is responsible for taking away FEMA 's autonomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt during his first term to separate FEMA and fund its purpose of responding to disasters. The most that has happened is to give some responsibility to Housing and Urban Development( HUD) to design temporary housing for disaster victims. This is another agency you should be trying to contact if you are without adequate housing as a result of Sandy. <p> babygirl963 <p> But yet and still you are able to post!!!!! Someone help me understand. Food is needed more so than internet, how in the heck are you on here posting, if you do not have something? <p> tsuki <p> What are you worried about? You have things stacked to the ceiling. Why do n't you share? Then your community would n't need help. <p> we have n't turn it down because we have n't gotten ANY aid.... hard to turn down NOTHING <p> Dankjk <p> " take responsibility for your own lives, thats not the governments job, its yours " Romney <p> Captain Panic <p> So... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn down aid that Romney wants to dismantle utterly? Or are you saying that when it 's in your governor 's hands, it will be done better. You know, because somehow your governor will get the military to bring in over 30 million gallons of fuel, equipment and personnel from other states to help repair the power infrastructure, etc.? <p> I know that 's what you really mean. Because you understand this so well. <p> Bored <p> According to you, you 're doing just fine. <p> babygirl963 <p> Thank you Lauren, restore the wise words from a woman. <p> tsuki <p> Been there, Lauren. It does get better. Sometimes, it does seem like it is taking forever, but when you look back on it, you 'll see a lot was done in a relatively short time. Basics first. <p> One thing we still talk about since Ivan, is the mile long convoy of hugh trucks full of workers from PECO Electric heading this way on I-10. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal. The Red Cross was set up the next day, and county emergency management had shipments from FEMA. No one checked for political correctness. <p> Of course, we had little in the way of communication other than word of mouth. Things were happening that we did not know about. <p> I can not do much for you except send money to the RC, and hope for the best for you. <p> silas1898 <p> And just how did he trick Christie into joining him? <p> And then magically got Christie to thank him. <p> I want those powers! <p> MyrddinWilt <p> Oh thats not a secret. Obama stopped off at a McDonalds on his way from the airport. <p> silas1898 <p> D'oh! <p> FoodForThought <p> You 're against Obama. Fine. We get it. But to say that he does n't care about NJ because you " are a conservative community " is, forgive me, a bit dumb. Even on the most basic level candidates care about all the communities because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just a " photo op ", the president went to see the devastation for himself. The government is sending aid, and yes, it is a slow process. It is much slower than I would prefer as well. But the thing that many, and it seems that you, Shore Thing, are one of them by what you 've said, do not seem to realize is our country is not ruled by one man. The president is an important part of our government, yes. But he is not the sole decider about everything that goes on. That being said, no matter what ANY candidate WANTS to do if he/she is elected/stays in office, do you think realistically everything is going to turn around and everything will be fixed? This economy has been headed steadily downward since 2000. It is not one man 's fault. And no man nor woman is going to be able to magically fix everything in four years. Whether it is Obama or Romney who is elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Shore Thing <p> Food for Thought, I am well aware how things work. I also know in his little photo-op he demanded FEMA do everything without delay or hassles.... not true. You say one man does not control the country, of course not, and I thank God he does n't. I find it amusing at best people saying it is not obama 's fault when they were quick to blame bush. At the very least maybe Romney will put Americans back to work! <p> K Fig <p> RMoney, who says as an Elected Official member of the Government he will " CREATE 12 MILLION JOBS ", also reminds us that " GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CREATE JOBS ". Your Flavor Aid is ready. <p> small business man <p> k fig you are partially correct. Government does not create jobs.... businesses create jobs. Again if you had the intelligence of my 5 year old you might be able to understand that business 's are against obama because he does not want them to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Romney wants to help us small business owners and helping small business 's help to create jobs. Got news for you, if obamacare does not go I have to fire more people who I will simply no longer be able to afford. <p> Get Educated, Friend. <p> Obama wants to tax people who live in absolute luxury, who make hand over fist, who do n't need, by any stretch, the ludicrous amounts of money that is being made -- made off the backs of hard workers who are paid minimum wage ; From Businesses, like Walmart, who 's corporate practice can literally level a small towns finances and screw with local economies. <p> Small businesses are safe, ya hulkin ' doof. <p> cjm69 <p> Thankfully, most voters have *more* intelligence than a five-year-old, and understand that it 's frankly delusional to say Obama " does not want businesses to make money. " We 're also smart enough not to imagine that a complex modern economy operates in such a way that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether businesses either A make money or B decide to hire. <p> babygirl963 <p> Sweety, it was always said, it is better to keep your mouth shut, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. How are you able to be on the internet. Silly woman. <p> Shore Thing <p> Actually, babygirl963, I am not a girl. We are up and running on the Internet because we had electric crews coming in volunteering services from all the red states in this country : texas, south carolina, tennessee. I am actually smart though have a generator.... lots of gas, and fire wood. <p> Stupid where do you think the State of NJ is getting the money to help you and other residents. FEMA is a federal agency that falls under the President 's jurisdiction. <p> Yvonne <p> Funny how the people who do n't want government to interfere in their lives are complaining that President Obama " Has n't done anything to help them " <p> http : **35;3271;TOOLONG... Sundiata Bradshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters like this. It 's the ones who still have n't " made up their mind " which is absolute bs. I really think these people are going to walk in to vote and flip a coin. I do feel that everyone should vote or do n't complain but these group of people should just not vote on the Prez if you have n't decided yet <p> Starderup <p> Similar to how Romney had to bus in supporters because the Univision interview simply held no interest for the students on campus. He also threatened to cancel that day unless they re-taped the introduction, because he did n't want them saying Obama gave them an hour, and Wrongme a half hour.. The mean spiritedness alone of this guy should be a big clue as to why he is totally unfit to lead this country. Obama/Biden 2012 -- Romney/Ryan 1040 <p> Shore Thing <p> Hmmm... obama=vote for revenge( lol) Romney=vote for love of country. obama=campaigns in 08 on " hope and change ".... changes nothing, makes things worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scare tactics. Obama ' 08 " people who have to use fear tactics to campaign do NOT have a record to run on.... obama is RUNNING FROM HIS RECORD because the economy has NOT improved, housing has DECLINED, he has doubled the deficit, and college students are graduating college not being able to find jobs but are in a hell of a lot of debt........ <p> 2 leaves <p> Sounds like a Romney script, nice copy job. <p> Don Johnson <p> Someone needs an economics class... <p> Jen L <p> And so the solution, according to the Shore Thing, is to vote for the guy who is worse in the areas that he complains about. Romney is refusing to state anything for the record because anything that he says will be used against him by voters. <p> You 're projecting again. <p> babygirl963 <p> Shore Thing, Romney did nothing during your disaster. He sent can food that you could not open. He did not have enough compassion to come see you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to your opinion, but do n't lie when the Governor who supports Romney calls you a liar. <p> http : **34;3308;TOOLONG... drzoon <p> as usual Shore Thing... you fell for a Romney lie( i see now that lying is not called " mitting "). That " revenge " statement was so out of context it might be as big of a lie as Mitt 's " jeep moving to china " and Ryan 's " three hour and something marathon. <p> Anonymous <p> I find it slightly disturbing that I ca n't find a single comment that is n't filled with hate toward one party or another. <p> Lincoln, a Republican, frees the slaves, the south is Democratic for a century. <p> LBJ, a Democrat, frees the slaves again, the south is Republican for 50 years. <p> Notice the pattern? <p> Shore Thing <p> I find it amusing that concerned " parents " took there children out to a rally in the cold without properly dressing them for the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing). People were fighting to get into the rally, they were not fighting to leave... in fact people were outside the fences watching the rally because they could not get in. This just shows liberals are liars just like their liar in chief..... benghazi obama lied people died. obama left our men behind to try to save his political career. we lost american lives because obama bends over to terrorists. <p> Derpaderp <p> Are you fucking retarded? <p> Nebel722 <p> Yes, yes he is. <p> Goosemarion <p> forgot about the 40 or so american diplomats that died overseas when bush was in office.nevermind the thousands of american troops in the irac that died for nothing.how convenient you shallow minded forgetfull turd. tell me, why isint mittins seeking gw bushes endorsement? please do tell ill be waiting right here. <p> Shore Thing <p> Bush was n't trying to cover up like obama. he said this attack was over a video... he is a liar..... it was and is terrorism.... wait obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muslin and a sympathizer.... obama has bailed on Israel our strongest ally..... obama is a lying piece of garbage... he was all there for a photo-op in Jersey but it was an empty promise just like everything else obama does <p> MUSLIN?! <p> quoting " Shore Thing " : " obama... is a muslin and a sympathizer " <p> OBAMA IS A MUSLIN? NO WONDER I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. <p> FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS! <p> MUSLIN?! <p> Dear Shore Thing, <p> To call the President a muslin is a very big deal, especially since he refrains from publicly discussing his fabric preferences. What does this mean? Are you a muslin scholar? Can you tell us about other presidents or elected officials who might also be muslin or -- GOD FORBID -- surely the gayest of fabrics????????????? <p> Sincerely, A concerned citizen <p> FoodForThought <p> Now, Shore Thing, do n't you think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments above you stated "... this is AMERICA and I will say what I want and the beautiful part is that you ca n't stop me ", which I wholeheartedly agree with. But tell me, do you know, I mean, truly know, anything about Islam? Have you read the Quran? Do you know the story of Muhammad? Do you associate with Muslims? Do you have any devout Muslim friends? The reasons I ask are simple. 1) You are being hypocritical by claiming that you can state whatever you want because this is America and we have certain freedoms. One of which is the freedom to practice any religion we choose without persecution. So even if Obama is a Muslim, what does that matter? How, exactly, is he sympathizing with terrorists? And why, exactly, does being Muslim automatically associate with terrorism? I suggest you read up on the subject before you talk about something like that unless you want to be seen as an uneducated fanatic. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you would realize that the vast majority of the religion practice in complete peace with absolutely no intention of harming anyone. Muhammad taught tolerance, taught kindness because " Allah is surely merciful ". <p> I know you are going to say that you have nothing against Muslims, that you were just saying that Obama bends over backwards with terrorists because he( supposedly) is a Muslim and sympathizes with Muslim extremists. But please, I beg of you, show me the proof of all these fanatic ramblings of yours. Show me proof of what you are saying is more than what you 've gathered from your own opinions or watching Fox News. Give me concrete evidence so that I can believe you. Prove it to me. Otherwise, all you are is just a pinhead with an inflated sense of ego. And that 's unfortunate. <p> HAHA, you people are so ignorant and so blind, you would n't see a door if it splits your heads wide open.... your comments keep me entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenting.... <p> http : **35;3344;TOOLONG... Robert Tulloch <p> Flash!!! Obama cornholes Colin Bowel backstage. <p> Shore Thing <p> We are from Jersey and we went to the rally last night because obama came to Jersey for a photo-op with the Governor and he has FAILED to send the help we in NJ need. Obama is a liar and he could care less about the people at the Jersey shore!!!!!!! <p> Acer <p> Wheras you, by taking this moment to complain about politics instead of going outside and helping with the disaster, well, clearly you despise Obama for being SO DIFFERENT from you, because HE is the political opportunist. Right? <p> Derigo1957 <p> No, I 'm thinking, " because he is the President ". Not much that " Shore Thing " can do. The President, however, has the world 's resources at his command. Jus ' sayin '. <p> frank <p> read the enumerated powers of the president under the Constitution.. seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king or dictator with absolute control? <p> really? <p> I disagree with you. my father works for FEMA and they have a crap ton of people out there helping. call it a " photo op " if youd like but the disaster cant be fixed in a day, or even a week for that matter. sorry you werent the first to be in line, but youll get youre help, just like everyone else, just like the President said. <p> http : **27;3381;TOOLONG Chris Bowen <p> Shore thing is obviously someone that the GOP targets. If you look at his posts he has tons of poor grammar and spelling, but is apparently well off enough to have a personal generator and plenty of fuel to power his house and cars. My only thought is that he is in an area of under-educated wealthy people. <p> john h Jersey Strong <p> There is nothing worse than ignorant UNIFORMED voters. Four years of nobama=no damn jobs. four years of nobama=benghazi, four years of nobama=FAST AND FURIOUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformed voter.... lacking education! <p> zapata86303 <p> Whereas, your educated self has such a strong command of English syntax and grammar! <p> Well asshole obviously you do not know much more about reality than the other folks who think like you. Obama has done great things for america and it is a pity that the lies you promote has blinded you to the facts in which are all around you. Colin Powell who is one of your own obviously can see the facts better than all of us and since he can not justify voting for a hate mongering liar than why should I. <p> ChelsieSutherland <p> When Romney was governor of my state, MA, we dropped to 47th out of 50 for job creation, with a job growth rate of around 1.5%( compared to the national average of 5.3%). The states we beat out were Ohio( lost most of it 's manufacturing at the time), Michigan( decline of auto) and Louisiana( Hurrican Katrina). Unemployment only started to get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more to do with high numbers of working-age adults exiting the state 's workforce, as MA had one of the highest levels of net out-migration of any state. <p> He made severe austerity cuts to local cities and towns in 2004, some by as much as 20%, and would have been more severe if the legislature did n't override his veto. His " cuts " included : caps in payments to medical providers( limiting payments to hospital stays to 20 days, no matter how sick the patient), rationing access of higher-priced meds to Medicaid patients, and cutting Medicaid eligibility to 36,000 people. Police forces had been cut so badly in the early years of his governorship, that crime rates in multiple cities continued to rise, to the point where Romney offered to have the state police sent out to towns worst affected. The cuts also decimated MA 's mental healthcare system : closing hospitals and health centers, raising the patient-to-counselor ratio to unsafe levels, cutting mental health services to children, employment services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds at DMH-run hospitals in MA at half the level they had been at earlier in 2004. <p> When Peabody asked for an emergency funding of $5mil in 2004 for a project to stop it 's chronic flooding, as part of the funding package to help repair the city from the massive floods it had already suffered, Romney vetoed it. <p> Because Romney had run on not cutting taxes, he attempted to close the budget deficit by severe cuts and raising fees. When local gov had to raise property taxes to make up for cut in funding, and residents complained, Romney signed into law legislation that allowed communities to shift the burden of property taxes from residential property owners to businesses. <p> He tried to veto raising the minimum wage to $8/hr in 2006, after claiming he wanted to index the minimum wage to inflation, but the legislation overrode him. <p> He tried to bring back the Death penalty to MA. <p> Not to mention that he was terrible at connecting or making any relationships with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to make himself unliked and unwelcome everywhere he has been in power, and left office in 2006 with a disapproval rating of 60%. Upon the end of his term, Romney 's staffers purchased the hard drives of their state-issued computers, and all emails were deleted from the server -- even though all emails are supposed to be preserved under the Massachusetts Public Records Law. <p> You bet, Limbaugh, Beck, Hannity and the entire Fox News Corp are nothing but a bunch of lefty lackies.... Recent job reports of 100,000 plus per month are much, much worse than Bush 's stellar -800,000 jobs per month....... Come on, try looking at facts.... <p> http : **35;3410;TOOLONG... Patrick Howe <p> me tink your facts are bit off, during Bush 's terms unemployment avg. aroumnd 5%. in the last two months we lost " 800,000? jobs. How many were seasonal losses? Now for the last 4 years we had U2 unemployment around 8% to 9%, Last month they say they created 171,000 jobs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over 100,000 in the US, that equals about 600 jobs per city. Now thats the facts if you please <p> MeowMix <p> Patrick Howe, your " facts " are actually way off as well. The unemployment rate that Bush started with in his first term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics was 4.2% At the end of his first term, it was 5.3%, an increase of 1.1%. At the end of his second term, the unemployment rate was 7.8%, an increase of 2.1% in his second term and an increase of 3.2% during his entire presidency. So, Obama took office with this 7.8% unemployment rate and as of statistics from October, the unemployment rate was 7.9%, and increase of 0.1% in the course of one term. What these statistics say to me is that Bush started the ball rolling in a really bad direction and the current administration has been doing whatever it can to keep things from getting way out of control and to bring things back to a place of stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to me. So far, I have n't heard anything from the right wing that makes sense( unless of course you go to the land of make-believe, that is). Oh, btw, here is the website for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in case you feel like doing your own research : http : **35;3447;TOOLONG... <p> MeowMix <p> You 'll notice that this is being posted on non-mainstream media, if you choose to pay attention to reality and not propaganda. So far, I have n't seen this or heard about it on NPR, the NY Times, or even Yahoo. Nobody is talking about it. So perhaps it 's true and the media is really run by conservatives with way too much influence. Btw, I work for some of these filthy rich conservatives who invested heavily in republican campaigns this year. Guess what they do? They run and invest in a bunch of media outlets. <p> Nursehenri <p> I can not believe this. Just think what Romey will do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut. No one will get any incentives, he will hold on to them too. Saying bread and water is enough We need to pray for him and his staff. <p> This has to be absolutely factual, I mean look at those tweets, totally cant be photo shopped I mean whatever you do, do n't use that phone to call for help, to film what is going on or in the very least to beat the person that is endangering your child so that you can get to a safe place. <p> Miles Taylor <p> You do realise those are reporters at the event that are tweeting, do n't you?

He 's one piece of shit and the whole world knows about it. I do nt know if that stuff here is true or not, and i do nt care. His speeches are true though. That should be enough to make him lose the Vote by about 99%... How can the " style " of a person, the hype and the advertisment be affecting enough, that it does nt matter what candidates stand for? <p> Thats simply not imaginable in nearly every other country. <p> USAGuest <p> We are silly americans wearing overalls and buying the white hype... im white btw and wear overalls, just not buying the slop anymore...

Not just the average person is afraid Ronmey might win, our politicians are very worried as well, because in terms of forgein afairs Romney is as blanc as a sheet of paper and nobody really knows what to expect, because he keeps saying different things on a daily basis. <p> Yours Truly, from a country where 5% would vote for Romney and 92% would vote for Obama, if they were allowed to. I 'm not making this up. <p> DOmega <p> Serves them right for supporting that lunatic. <p> Randan333 <p> You want to support a candidate that vows to dictate what actions you will be allowed perform, this is how it 's done.

Commonly called kidnapping. <p> Knowitalldouche <p> False imprisonment and kidnapping are legally two different things. Kidnapping involves moving a person without his or her consent. This situation is false imprisonment because they are not being moved, but rather their freedom of movement is being violated. <p> Kvandizzle <p> Regardless of the political views of people if it is 42 degrees out and you are ignorant enough to put your children at risk taking them into cold temperatures knowing how long a rally usually lasts I can not feel sorry for you. I do however feel sorry for your children but whining on twitter or facebook because of a choice YOU made makes you look ignorant. I did not read all of the previous comments but a few caught my eye like a person who stated they was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old children. What the heck were you thinking? Your children should matter more than going to a political rally that you could find information about online. Seriously. I am not going to apologize for being harsh because of people getting their panties in a twist due to how " politically correct " this country has become. I just can not believe that this is a story at all. Grow up, use common sense, be a better parent by not taking your children out when it is potentially too cold for them, and take responsibility for your own actions rather than blaming someone else. Nobody made you go to the rally! <p> http : **30;3484;TOOLONG? id=1... Akira Bear <p> Are you freaking kidding me? <p> Anacoluthia <p> Wow, you 're really stupid.

When you attend a rally you are n't signing a contract preventing you to leave before it 's over. <p> Kvandizzle <p> I agree that if the parents did go against better judgement by taking their children out into potentially cold conditions( If you live in PA you already know that it gets cold quickly. People are acting so naive) they should have been able to leave. I am not disagreeing about that part. <p> You 're an idiot <p> So children should never go out if the temperatures are too cold, on the off chance that some random " security personnel " are going to keep them out in the cold for much longer than they should be? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a small chance a stranger could kidnap my child, I will never let them leave the house. " The parents are in no way in the wrong here, and saying they are is just plain old ignorant. When I was a kid, I went to an outdoor event in the dead of winter at Willow Grove Naval Air Base( PA). Maybe 4 years old. You know what my parents were allowed to do when I got too cold? TAKE ME AWAY FROM THE COLD. Romney and his staff are completely in the wrong, and the parents are in no way in the wrong, and to say otherwise indicates your extreme bias. <p> They should be allowed to leave regardless of whether they had ill children or not. You can not keep people from leaving for whatever reason they are free to go as they please from a public event or private for that matter. <p> You'rewrong <p> I 'm sure it was n't freezing when they first got to the rally. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about people with their freedom. You probably just know the ' Freedom of Speech ' and that 's it. People are suppose to be free to attend and leave a POLITICAL RALLY. And while these people were free to attend, they are being denied their freedom to LEAVE. And that denied freedom is not only having everyon in false imprisonment, but is actually risking the lives of many children and possibly adults. These tweets above are from the Media. And people who are in the rally WANTING to get their now health endangered children to the ER should make a call to the Police so that the security officers, AKA Romney 's Staff, can give them their freedom again. You do n't seem to know much about common sense since you 're bitching about how people are trying to get their children more involved with politics, and are clearly being punished for such actions. The common sense here is that the people in the audiance should be calling for the Police, instead of using their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> http : **32;3543;TOOLONG John Seitz <p> Maybe you should pay attention to what you are reading before making ignorant biased comments Kvandizzle. <p> The " tweets " above, were made by a reporter for the New York Times, and a reporter for USA Today, not by people whining on twitter or facebook. <p> Furthermore, the rally started more than an hour late because the Romney campaign had air travel delays. The people who went the rally were prepared had it started on time. Once it got to be too late and too cold for them, they decided to leave, only to be told they could not. <p> Foxygrimreapess <p> Do you know why the people at the rally are being denied their rights to leave? <p> Stan Johnson <p> How was Kvandizzle being biased? <p> Mulberrygirl <p> Not sure about biased, but their argument is ridiculous. Since when are we required to stay at a public event against our will? What in the world is wrong with people wanting to leave? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> usa <p> and yet they 're being stopped from leaving when they choose to. <p> Mulberrygirl <p> Ummm... are you kidding me? Who says you have to stay for the whole rally? They should be free to do as they please. You are ridiculous and not too bright. The people do n't even have to state a reason for leaving, why would you thik it was ok for them to be kept captive and not be allowed to leave? What is wrong with you? <p> Deano <p> Yes, you do n't need to have ANY reason, much less a " good " one, to leave a public or private event. In America, you have the right to leave an event without having to give a reason. So, it 's completely irrelevant to make points about the health and welfare of the children, or the legal right for parents to take children to ER 's if there is a health concern because the point is : you do not need any reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : **31;3577;TOOLONG Glenn Olson <p> Yes, I 'll grant that it was shortsighted to bring one 's children out there in the first place. Does n't speak well of Republican supporters in the first place, but let 's set that aside for now for a more important question : How in the hell does that even come close to excusing the refusal to let them out after the fact? <p> Marcus2012 <p> I do n't care if it was negative, and their parents took them out there naked, it 's taking hostages and this is SERIOUSLY fucked up, holy shit, could he possibly expect to actually win? He 's been a joke for months now, but this takes the whole fucking cake. <p> http : **35;3610;TOOLONG... Steve Cox <p> You are an idiot.

For stating an opinion as you just did. Are you also a troll? <p> http : **30;3647;TOOLONG? id=5... Nick Makhmaltchi <p> Well. This, like most political comments, show how most of the american public are stupid assholes. Do you people really think of everything as " right wingers " and " left wingers "? You ca n't fit people into 2 tightly knit categories, it does n't work. Having our whole government based on only 2 parties basically being able to achieve any political success is detrimental to democracy. And anyone who thinks in pure " left " or " right " are fucking morons. <p> http : **25;3679;TOOLONG Debra <p> Some of his rally photos are photoshopped with more crowds than were really there. Geez. <p> dantes44 <p> Keep believing that. <p> And please have no sharp objects within reach on Nov. 7th. <p> Vandigo <p> Even a child can spot where there were " clones of the crowd " in a lot o the pictures. I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw anything in a picture, and she pointed out three spots that were cloned from other spots int he crowd. That particular one was a Nevada rally. <p> Mgm5606 <p> I 'm afraid they are correct about the photoshopping. I saw one photo of a rally and clearing a third of the " crowd " was photoshopped. Either that or about 50 pairs of identical twins attended and sat in the same rows across the rally. <p> Fireblazes <p> I love the smell of desperate Romney supporters in the morning, <p> dantes44 <p> LOL. Desperation is when you try to float a story that EVIL ROMNEY is holding kids against their will. You lefties really need some psychiatric help. <p> Have you even seen the events? Romney 20k plus while Barry is struggling to get 2K. <p> Arvol <p> Do n't forget that Romney advocates photoshop all his rally pictures to make them appear bigger than they really are! <p> No, desperation is democrats showing up at a Romney rally, tweeting complete bogus stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do believe your claim of loving things that smell. <p> Marcus2012 <p> He was a writer for the New York Times, and he seems pretty Pro-Rmoney. <p> olandp <p> LOL <p> Fireblazes <p> It does not matter now the story is out there. I just find it interesting that this is one of the few stories on Ablog that attracted swarms of Romney trolls. Me thinks that you doth protest too much! <p> http : **30;3706;TOOLONG Vinny Aboud <p> Daddyvice, that is a joke, Romney 's staff wo n't even allow wide camera angles, because there were so few people at most of his rally. The man is an ageing ken doll, and just as stiff. <p> colleen2 <p> They smell like losers <p> Chipenguin <p> The fact remains that the temperature was 42 degrees, which is cold, and cause enough for some people who want to leave after spending lots of time outside, and no security protocol exists that forces people to stay at a certain place against their will. You simply can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or that " there were security measures in place ". <p> dannyvice <p> Then tell that to the secret service. They do it at Obama rallies as well. It 's a safety measure that I 'm sure they do n't intend to change. But while we 're on the subject of cold, how about those folks in New Jersey that have been without power, blankets and food for a week now. Obama flew in for his photo opp with Christie, then flew right back out. A week later, new jersey residents are scraping food out of dumpsters to survive. It is below freezing in New Jersey tonight. I note you did n't spend one moment considering their well being since it does n't fit into your stupid political narrative. <p> Jaiyetaylor <p> At least he showed up on time.... <p> http : **32;3738;TOOLONG John Seitz <p> dannyvice :...... and everyone( except multiple marriage Giulianni) involved in New Jersey and New York has said that President Obama continues to be involved and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an invention called a " cell phone.

The ' photo op ' you mention was their first face-to-face meeting after Obama had gotten on the phone with him repeatedly during and after the storm to see if the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feel free to hate him all you want to, but do n't use us up here in NY/NJ as pawns for your political spin ; *everyone* I 've talked to up here appreciates his response. <p> FritoLaid <p> You forget the little bit of time he took away from the campaign to assist Christie, Republicans said he was disorganized and knew he was going to lose. You ca n't win with you guys. <p> Concerned College Student <p> Besides the fact I ca n't even handle some of the comments below, I would like to know a lot more about this. Like a video or some facts from somewhere. It makes me so sad that people can say such hurtful things to other people that they categorize as ' left ' and ' right ' just because they believe in something different. People can believe what they want, no matter what. If the rally was n't letting people leave, that is bad. But if it was for a security reason, I entirely get it. Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for a candidate even if you do n't believe in their beliefs, they should n't be subject to vulnerabilities because of that. Sorry for having a little rant, Just wanted to make myself heard is all <p> Rusty Parker <p> Right. And if there was an actual security reason and not some excuse like security saying " It 's not cold, " I would be all for it. Sadly, it was n't the case. Do you really think LEAVING is a security risk for a rally No, not at all. In fact, staying is since more people are likely still coming in. There was no security risk, just simple entrapment from misguided security that was trained improperly intentionally. <p> cole3244 <p> if you belong to the gop you support fascism plain and simple, simple enough for even a goper to understand. <p> Laurengolis <p> I was at the rally tonight, with a 1 yr old and a 3 yr old. 30,000 people were excited to be supporting Romney and his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear very well and when my kids were ready to leave we left- no one was holding anyone back. There were at least 25+ bathrooms( one paper said there were none) and everyone I saw was enduring the cold with a smile. It was a memorable night for all of us. Obamedia is upset that Romney received such an enormous turnout in PA and is trying to create lies to take away the positive momentum of the night. We the people are smarter than that! * Proud to be American and Proud to VOTE Romney Ryan on Tuesday! * <p> dannyvice <p> That 's why they are doing this Lauren. Romney crowds are swelling far past capacity -- while they are having to bus in union members to fill the stands at Obama rallies. Notice only Democrat surrogates tweeted this nonsense. You do n't see a single person on the news complaining to a camera anywhere -- that 's because there were n't any complaints. We show up because we want to show up, not because some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker <p> You mean, proud to try and support he who ca n't even keep his ideals straight for even a year? Right, and Obama 's support is full of lies. Voting for someone who will rip rights away from half the people in this country just to keep taxes off the rich will not fix anything in this country. We do n't need another Bush, and that is exactly what Romney is. <p> Tanzigirl <p> We need neither one... Obama has done the country no good what so ever.. if he gets into office we will have further devastation to our economy, Obama-care is a nightmare and foreign policy issues.. not to mention he is lies.. With Romney we would also have issues with the economy.. No one but the rich would be able to go to college and get an education.. so I guess that only people with money matter.. he flip flops on obama-care.. again a nightmare.. can not make up his mind on gun control, feels gay people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the government is worried about with the countries issues right now!)..

LMAO at their stupidity. <p> If he thought he had a chance in Ohio, he would n't have even gone to Pennsylvania. He does n't have a chance in Pennsylvania either. :) <p> dantes44 <p> Lol.

Here 's a news flash for you. Every single campaign rally holds at least one gate -- and usually it 's all the gates -- until the candidate and his/her staff leaves the area. It 's a safety measure that is set up -- not by campaign staffers -- but the secret service. This story is a load of bs. from top to bottom. Temperatures were nowhere near freezing. <p> Conhater <p> How the F%$K would you know Vice were you there?? <p> dannyvice <p> Actually yes, I 've been to three of them... And yes, this is standard procedure at rallies idiot. And several people who attended that rally have already come to this blog to refute what was said..... and if that 's not enough for you, the author of this idiotic story sent a retweet, stating himself that the secret service was the group holding the gate until Romney and his staff left. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends there and they said the temp was around 41 degrees F.... a jacket and mittens on any kid would prevent a chill and nevermind " FROST BITE "! This crock of lies is obviously a lefty whirl of the dervish <p> dannyvice <p> The twitter hoe above is no other than the daughter of Democrat Dennis Kucinich. Now what would she be doing at a Romney rally except to try to cause trouble 2 days before an election. Oh, and I looked it up. The temperatures were nowhere near freezing. Believe a democrat at your own peril <p> Dottie <p> Dottie Smith I 'm going to go back with the whole colored, niggas, negros, black, African American.

It 's not because they believe he will fix the economy. It 's because they are afraid President Obama will. <p> They make more money on a bad economy than on a working economy. There was a bill passed that states the EPA can not pass any more regulations that would negatively effect their profits, until unemployment gets below 6.0%. <p> They need Romney to win because they know unemployment will not get anywhere near as low as 6.0 if he is elected. <p> Wake up! <p> dannyvice <p> Oh yes... The old faithful Dem argument about big oil. Missing from your blather is the fact that big oil has gas prices that are twice what they were when Obama was elected. But you go ahead with your conspiracy theories. The EPA is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late November. They are working on policies right now, so they will be locked in regardless of who is elected. <p> Obama directly lied to the American people about that during the debates. I have a friend that works for the EPA, and Obama wants coal production shut down, and they 'll do it by regulating it to death. <p> It 's really too bad you are stinking up the state of Missouri. But I 'm glad very few Missourians share your leftist views. <p> Heffethx <p> Man you sure are one nasty ahole <p> Shanghai14 <p> You know you are telling the truth when you get called a " nasty ahole " by a lefty! HAHAHA! Keep telling the truth Danny! They cant take it so they start being the follower children they are and call pitiful names. what a shame. <p> Tony <p> If people are standing around for hours and there 's wind there is a windchill factor ever heard of frostnip very easy to get frostbite especially in children. You also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, clothing. you 're a moron. <p> The campaign did not hold anyone for hours and hours. Go to an Obama rally. The secret service holds the gate at all rallies until Obama has left the parking lot. It 's a safety measure to protect the candidate bonehead. There are enough issues to talk about, trying to turn something idiotic like this into some kind of an attack on Romney is weak. <p> And I do n't trust a word of it, since the only one 's tweating about it are democrats who unceremoniously show up at a Romney rally. Jackie Cucinich is an Obama surrogate and the daughter of Democrat congressman Dennis Cucinich. <p> Tony <p> It was n't an attack on Romney it was a response to the person who thinks that 45 is not cold enough to get hypothermia or frostbite. if you 're standing around and people did wait around for hours, a young child standing around for two hours in that kind of temperature can turn into a dangerous situation. If people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to panic, well panic can increase heart rate and blood flow, that 's reducing blood flow in the extremities sending it to the core to keep vital organs safe. When you are cold you 're cold you want to get the bleep out of wherever you are. <p> dannyvice <p> Fine, Tony, then why do n't you have a word with the secret service about it. They do this at Obama rallies as well for the President 's safety. And while you 're at it, why do n't you ask Obama why there are people in New Jersey who have been out in the cold for a week now without power or even the FEMA support they were promised? Obama flew in for his photo opp and then left them behind to scrape for food out of dumpsters. <p> http : **26;3909;TOOLONG Chris <p> What is this I hear???

A person can become hypothermic at 60 F if they are not dressed for the weather. <p> Shanghai14 <p> Only an idiot would take there kids to a rally without cold weather gear in the Penn State in November... no more to be said. <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> desperate liberals making things up, all because herds of people have been walking out on Obummer. <p> zach <p> This is not true.....

Got ta get the commissions from the billion dollar rubes. <p> hollywoodstein <p> Who let the Trolls out, woof woof. <p> Derrick Mains <p> 45 degrees in Philly and people are frost bitten not only is Romney a monster but he can work miracles by shattering the laws of science and causing people to get frostbite at temperatures far greater than any know case of frostbite in human history this man is a god and evil god!! <p> straightnotnarrow <p> Well, let 's look at the comment here. " Shattering the laws of science. " I 'm a scientist, a physician in fact. And while one is unlikely to suffer from true frost bite( frozen devitalized tissue), one is perfectly capable of suffering from chillblains at temps well above the freezing point. This causes a painful inflammatory lesion and I think a lay person would be fair to fear frostbite not knowing the difference. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about science or facts of any kind. <p> Spouting science at them only confuses their tiny minds. <p> Missi <p> I 'm not on either side of this argument when it comes to politics, but I just wanted to point out that frostbite is possible in temperatures even up to 45 degrees with hypothermia occurring even at 60 degrees. It does not need to be freezing to still feel the health effects of cold. <p> Shanghai14 <p> Are you people truly suggesting that anyone would be dumb enough to go out in PA in November and expect anything other than cold? Come on people! those parents did not take there kids out in the cold unprepared, this is a bull crap story and that 's the truth! <p> Tony <p> Laws of science? Read my post above smart guy. <p> Vandigo <p> I got frostbite on one of my feet when it was 40 degrees outside a couple years back. It DOES happen. I 'm living proof.

Too bad, I have a high tolerance for dumb people. Think of all the people President Obama has saved. He missed 4 of them, but he tried, but those 4 people, even with him trying, still died. I do n't know if this is true, or if what you said is true. But honestly, I do n't care. I 'm fine with politics until it begins to hurt more than it helps. This is one of those sad cases, along with people being attacked for voting for someone. <p> Ancelyn ap Gwalchmai <p> Breaking : We could have four more tortured and killed right there in Pennsylvania if Romney staffers do n't shape up. Stop being a dolt. <p> http : //www.ryanstake.net RyansTake <p> Breaking : There 's some really crappy news coming from the candidate I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment. <p> Paine <p> 3000 innocent Americans were killed while George Bush was reading " My Pet Goat. " <p> http : //twitter.com/DebD451 DebD <p> What the hell was he supposed to do? Jump up and give the terrorists the pleasure of seeing that they flustered the President? Or perhaps he should have appologized to the terrorists. At least he did n't party at Vegas after they died. <p> SFAW <p> What was Bush supposed to do? Not act like a deer in the headlights, for starters. Well, actually, for starters, he could have paid attention to the August 6, 2001, PDB, instead of telling the guy delivering " OK, now you 've covered your ass. " And he partied plenty of other times. Strumming that gee-tar and having a piece of birthday cake while Heckuva-Job-Brownie was screwing up the " response " to Hurricane Katrina, for one. <p> Paulrocks <p> 18 Vacations in 4 years( President Obama) = more partying in a time of economic despair than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> Do n't forget the 100 rounds of golf played for 4 hours each time, while Americans are out of work. <p> Naja pallida <p> Except Bush Jr., who had more than twice as many vacation days at the same point in his Presidency... but granted, it is a lot easier to tank an economy than bring one back. It is n't like he had any major issues to deal with during his time that could have benefited from him paying more attention to his job. <p> **27;4082;TOOLONG <p> Bush took 1020 complete vacation days, which already debunks your stupid comment. Now even Bush 's flights to Texas were 5 times the price that Obama spent on his vacations. <p> Under GW Bush there were 12 US embassy and consulate attacks while he was in office with a total of 58 dead. <p> Kushs61 <p> How many were blamed on a video...? For 9 days...? <p> Lov446 <p> how long did it take to find out the what-where and why for 9-11? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center, Saramis - 3,000 dead. <p> Billyrouth20000 <p> Bush did n't lie and blame a video, Bush also did n't pull security during the anniversary of 9-11 <p> Saramis <p> So he should just stay awake all the time unless literally every American in the world is safe. You know people ca n't stay up for so long or they 'll become clinically incompetent, not quite a state for the president to be in. <p> crystal <p> Bush had over 11 embassies attacked under his watchful eye.. with over 50 people killed and nobody even noticed!! <p> Translation : This thing coming from the party I support sounds really bad and makes me feel really uncomfortable, so I 'm going to wear a tin foil hat and insist all these reporters are committing a mass conspiracy, and somehow suggest all of this is a reason to vote for the party I do n't like. All of that makes me feel so much better. Yay, cognitive dissonance! <p> Dana <p> Betty, you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are so fucking stupid I do n't understand how you 're even still alive. Love, the entire Europe. <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> Dana, You are a woman, yes? If you vote Democrat you are so fucking stupid I do n't understand how youre still alive, because the liberals would of aborted you. <p> Your right. The man sat in the sit room and watched those men fight for their life. Never sending help. Just knowing that this so called President let those beautiful people die is a sin/ He s no good. What he did to all of us in the last four years, is disgusting. He should just go back to Kenya where he was born, Comes here as an exchange student. gets a false SS card from the state of Mass. Yea. right he was born in Hawaii Smartin up folks he is nothing but joke that fooled everyone who voted for him <p> misszee4 <p> Wow! And they want to vote for him? If this do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As much as I 'd like to believe this, the fact that the only evidence is some screenshots of Twitter feeds leaves too much room for doubt in my mind. Some more concrete evidence, supportive or not, would be helpful. <p> If Romney treats the people trying to support him this way... I fear for the rest of us. I was really hoping to vote for a Republican this year, being that I 'm an independent and like to keep my mind open( I also hate voting repetitively), but... Every Republican campaigning this year has just made it so hard to support them. Hell, half my family are well-off White people, and they 're not even voting for Romney any more. Just one big mistake after another, turning his race in to a train wreck... <p> Tomleland <p> Believe me, if you were hoping to vote for a republican any time in the last 60 years, your mind sure ai n't " open ". <p> An Anonymous Soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these men are willing to work for a Soldier 's salary. I 'll tell you when that 'll happen. Right. Never. <p> An Anonymous Soldier. <p> Oh, hell. Here comes the opinion of someone in the military. You know, the opinions none of you want to hear? As of now, I can not speak badly of Obama. He is my Commander-in-Chief, and I will always respect that POSITION. However, the man, I do not respect. Say everything and anything you want about how Obama is a loving and caring person. I 'll believe it when he comes out here and hangs with us soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen. Talks to us as if we 're people, instead of blissfully ignoring our existence/releasing the names of men on covert operations thereby putting my brothers and sisters in uniform in danger. That man is a disaster on its way to destroying the country. That being said, Mitt Romney ai n't much better. I voted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with, yaknow, putting on the uniform and serving this country every day), and I 'll keep my vote to myself. I 'll give you a hint -- it was n't either of them. I 'm not going to vote for someone who has no respect for the military and knows nothing about the military that they are at the top of the Chain of Command for. And, as far as this article goes, I am following the Twitter accounts of each of these journalists, and they 're trying to clarify that the crazy-ass leftists are running with a story that does n't exist. My family lives in PA. Some were at that rally. Trust me, people went there of their own volition, and they were not allowed to leave for a short period of time because of a security issue. Guess what. They got to leave as soon as it was resolved. Get over it. Learn the facts before you call someone an evil human being or claim unlawful imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the rights of the citizens of the United States of America. <p> MontanaSid <p> Real brave " soldier " when you sign anonymous. What a fake. <p> PLUMBOB6 <p> His first name i bet is Tagg <p> An Anonymous Soldier. <p> Actually my first name is Kirsten. I 'm a female. But, like... Oh my god thanks for totally thinking I 'm a dude. Like seriously. Did n't you know females can be in the military? Or does " Soldier " just automatically make you assume " This person has a penis. " <p> An Anonymous Person <p> But if he guessed your name as Sarah, you would have been offended that he was calling you " girly "... derp. <p> hollywoodstein <p> I bet her first name is Tagg. <p> Pathetic Anonymous " soldier " <p> actually, anyone who could think that republicans could ever be better for this country SHOULD be a man. Women who support repugnicans are morons with stockholm syndrome <p> Robinson Crudite <p> " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for complaining about the Commander in Chief. By the way, my name is Kirsten. " <p> I work at a VA hospital, and I 've seen dozens of veterans like you, condescending assholes complaining that they defended the freedoms of people who do n't " deserve " freedom, when what they really mean is that they want to force people to believe EXACTLY as they do. They have a sad entitlement mentality that makes them believe they are owed respect while they are hateful, violent, racist, and actively work to take citizens ' rights away. <p> Anyway, good luck being the only person in the world who knows the real news, since TV and internet and print media are all lying. You however have the secret to real news and the actual truth, which you do n't get from TV or internet or print media, apparently. Little voices in your head, perhaps? Morse code messages from Mars? Whatever it is, I 'm sure it 's completely accurate. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my Commander-in-Chief. Silly bananas. NCOs who may stumble upon this ca n't bitch at me if they do n't know who I am. And I am not into being bitched at by dipfuck NCOs who enforce regulations that they do n't follow. <p> Moderator3 <p> A bit of advice -- we can see your IP address. DISQUS also has access to it. I do n't know how DISQUS would react if a government agency were to request the IP address. <p> If you are ashamed you need to get the hell out your not worth the honor of putting on the uniform if that is the way you feel <p> An Anonymous Soldier. <p> I defend the constitution. And the rights of those around here so that perhaps we can progress. But I 'm ashamed of a lot of the people in this country, including fellow soldiers, marines, sailors, etc. Allowing politics to brainwash them. Maybe everyone should learn facts instead of just blindly believing words the politicians say. Do n't read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and find out for yourself what 's going on. Do n't lie to me and tell me you all spend all this time going out into the world and finding out what 's going on. For the most part everyone just knows what they read on the internet and in newspapers, and what they can watch on television. It 's not an accurate source of information.I can tell you that I have seen reporters out here literally bullshitting. There would be nothing going on, and we 'd just be sitting on the FOB smoking cigarettes and shooting the shit about our day and a reporter would say something on camera about some bullshit IED explosion that did n't exist because it got better ratings for the station. Seriously. News is all fake now. Everyone 's just looking for a story. And even though the people in this country make me angry... Infuriated actually, and even though I am fucking ashamed of how misinformed everyone allows themselves to be, I will still put on this uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this country is about. The rights we have deserve to be protected, whether people use them intelligently or not. The job is n't about liking all the people we defend. It 's about believing that we should. So thanks for saying I 'm not worthy of the uniform I worked my ass off to earn. But I 'm pretty sure I am. <p> ShinjisSecret <p> Maybe you will get lucky and meet a man to marry in some other country so you do n't have to come back to the " pathetic " people of the US. Again, this is n't WWII. You are not defending anyone 's right to be anything. <p> Naja pallida <p> An honest question : What part of our Constitution is defended by our current wars? Which part is defended by having our military deployed all over the world, draining our treasury and sticking our nose where it has no business being, while millions of people right here in our country go homeless, go hungry, and suffer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in natural disasters and the economic cesspool we 're drowning in -- this was the case before Bush tanked the economy. While I 'm glad you did n't vote for either war monger, none of our current Presidential candidates, of any party, have any real military experience. They 're all career politicians and/or lawyers. Minor party candidates tend to have a more sane stance on the military than either major party... but the chances of them being able to make a serious impact are slim, if not entirely impossible. This election third party candidates have been entirely ignored, and not even part of the discussion, even by sources that generally try to be more inclusive. <p> Jim Olson <p> Careful Naja. Asking questions like that is likely to get you disappeared. <p> Naja pallida <p> Being disappeared would probably be better than another four years of Republicans intentionally making everyone in this country suffer, while they 're cheered on by people too ignorant to know any better. <p> hollywoodstein <p> Anonymouse Personae, You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided adventure war can be. Fifty Thousand casualties and 3 Trillion dollars and to what end? Fifty thousand casualties so no Americans will be killed by the bad guys. Making more terrrrrists by killing civilians and woman and children? Spending Trillions over there so we do n't have to spend them over here. <p> GF plz, war is a racket. You are defending Halliburton 's profits, not the Consitution or anyones freedom. Make certain your war is a just war before you pick up a gun. <p> An Anonymous Citizen <p> I tip my hat to you ma'am. A lot of people on this site are attacking you for your opinions. I agree with you on your stance that neither one of the choices are optimal and would like to congratulate you on voting " independent. " I totally understand what you are trying to say, and I wish people would try and understand what you are saying. Especially, since the Left always bill themselves as the more caring and understanding. I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rally. I see them trying to turn this into a statistic they can spin. I wish they would n't because it reminds me so much of the Right. A couple of people at the rally complained, because it was probably a long, cold, and tiring day. They are now apologizing for making people worry about them. When, it was n't that bad of a situation. Unfortunately, those people are now forgotten about in the righteous fervor to get revenge. I wish more people would not just believe everything someone says to them, because they share a political party. <p> PLUMBOB6 <p> Your the one that said your ashamed not me.There is no dought that you did work your ass off like all service members do to wear the uniform.But like anyone that does their job i would n't want the person next to me do be ashamed of what they are doing whether it is in a fox hole or painting a house <p> PLUMBOB6 <p> And that was n't a like it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly of Obama, however the man I do not respect. <p> hollywoodstein <p> Hey Genius An Anonymouse Soldier, Keep voting for the ones who want to waste your lives on unnecessary wars, and want to keep cutting your benefits. <p> hollywoodstein <p> Dear Anymouse Soldier, <p> Did you really say, Idiots make me ashamed of the fact that I protect the rights of the citizens of the USA. <p> You are not a super citizen for being in the military. Idiots who pick up guns to fight illegal, unjust wars based on lies are not protecting the rights of citizens any more than someone with the courage to protest those same wars. We are all Americans, even the Idiots. <p> hollywoodstein <p> I should know. <p> Bystander <p> I 'd like to see how long this country stays " our country " -- The United States of America -- if we had no military or defense. How long do you really think that would last, hmm? <p> No one forced you to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drafted. <p> If you 're so ashamed to be protecting our rights of people just because they disagree with you, then maybe you should n't be in the military. I do n't feel sorry for you, and quite frankly I do n't respect you. <p> ShinjisSecret <p> I am a US veteran. I do not agree with all of the President 's policies, but he has been looking out for the troops a lot more than the republican party does. I do n't understand why so many in the military are meatheads who vote for people who want to send them to more wars, reduce VA benefits, and lower the standards to enter service. You are not protecting anyone 's rights here, so get real. You probably signed up to kill people and get the GI Bill. If you are so ashamed of your service, then get the dishonorable discharge you deserve Good luck getting a job in the real world that does n't involve serving fries with that. <p> Naja pallida <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops are the ones that do not want to create any new war veterans. <p> HEIDI <p> Dear Anonymous Soldier, thank goodness the majority of our men and women who serve see what a wonderful President Obama is and will vote for out POTUS. My husband served in the Persian Gulf War " 82nd Airborne " under Bush Senior when you were wearing diapers. Do not try and make Benghazi and issue, no matter how you Republicants try and make it one... it will never be an issue. Under Republican President Bush, 3,000 of our American citizens were murdered on American soil and lets not forget how awful Hurricane Katrina was handled and how our people were left to suffer without help for days upon days...

MY HUSBAND A PERSIAN GULF WAR VETERAN AND MYSELF ARE VOTING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!! <p> Griff <p> I was there. This is total bullshit and if you were dumb enough to bring your young kids to this event you 're probably a democrat. <p> Jaden <p> ARE YOU REALLY THAT STUPID WHY WOULD A DEMOCRAT EVEN GO OH MY GOd <p> Skertso <p> That 's a idiot statement! <p> Robinson Crudite <p> The logic of a Romney supporter in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen. <p> http : //twitter.com/DarthWyatt Darth Wyatt <p> Um, it was 44 degrees in Bucks County at the time of the event. Hardly hypothermia conditions. Also this : <p>? @JFKucinich <p> @ashleyrparker notes that people were not being let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterman <p> What idiocy! Why would security concerns keep people from being able to leave? You prevent additional attendees from coming IN for security concerns, not from leaving. <p> Ng <p> When ghe bus came in folks leaving that direction toward farm had to wait for a few minutes. <p> They were not told why but was on fence and reason was obvious. <p> The entire rear of farm was an exit if needed some mile or more of orange temp fencing. <p> It was good fun and not cold <p> Li <p> Wow. People can definitely develop hypothermia at 44 degrees. <p> Hypothermia is a serious drop in core body temperature. 44 degrees can easily be cold enough for someone to have hypothermia. <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> As A doctor, nope not cold enough. <p> Asa <p> Same thing/tactic if you open your door and two mormons are staring back at you with " Great news! " <p> liberallyfreex3 <p> Mitt Romney is a fucking animal. Do not vote this man into office. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democrat and that kind of language is not appropriate. Makes you sound like the other side. <p> Independent of the idiocy <p> Oh shut up, you all sound the same. <p> Byrdman <p> But obama is better. What has he done for the USA. I will tell you what he has done. Nothing but put us much more in debt. So that 's for y'alls great president <p> OMFG DEBT <p> After 8 years of shit, seems like he 's starting to get things accomplished. Our debt is actually lower now than it was 4 years ago, but that 's okay, keep watching Fox News. <p> EdM01 <p> If this is how Mitt Romney treats his supporters, imagine how he 'll treat the rest of this country. Worse than Hitler and Stalin, I fear. <p> Theocrats, if you 're reading this, you better write in JESUS. Because Mittens does n't serve your Jesus, nor that of the Mormon Church. All he serves is himself, and mammon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that IT serves HIM. <p> And ask yourselves this, theocrats : what is he likely to do if elected? Certainly not impose the theocracy of your dreams, or that of your nightmares( besides the islamic one). More likely, he 'll go the Bain Capital strategy. Load the nation up even more with debt, engineer a financial crisis, take the country bankrupt, and privatize the US government and the US military( to the Chinese and other creditor nations). <p> As much as I hate Romney, as much as a horrid person I think he is... not really worse than murdering 9 million people. Unless he plans to murder the US population by concentration camps and gas chambers.. <p> EdM01 <p> You think he 's going to stop at 9 million!? FYI, his debacle of a foreign debutante tour this summer( remember his cock-ups in London?) included an endorsing or a near-endorsing of an Israeli strike on Iran. This will inevitably bring on World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perish in the nuclear holocaust that will ensue. <p> VAGINA <p> Normally I 'd feel bad for these people, but, well... they DID go to a Romney rally voluntarily. They did it to themselves. And people, THIS is exactly how Romney will rule America if he 's allowed to steal this election. Do n't let him. <p> NCitizen <p> Wait a minute.. does n't anyone have a cell phone? Call the cops. Holding people against their will is kidnapping. <p> PLUMBOB6 <p> They should have taken their kids closer to the front of the stage, with all the hot air coming from mitt they would be down to their underware <p> http : **35;4146;TOOLONG... Craig Allen <p> How, exactly, can they force you to stay? It 's a free country... at least until after Tuesday. If Rmoney wins, and you 're part of the 47%, they 'll likely send you to a poor house or maybe a... a... camp for re-education or something. Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this actually would/could constitute a crime in most states. I think that 's true in PA also... holding someone against their will. <p> misszee4 <p> This is a charge known as false imprisonment and it is a felony. It is the same as kidnapping in some states. <p> Dtoyzmom <p> I 'd love to see this on the news tomorrow morning! <p> Ercobb <p> I want to see how FOX spins it!! LOL <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> You wo n't because its not true, just more fear mongering before the election. Its the only thing they have left, after even their liberal News papers started endorsing Romney today <p> Tumblr <p> Checked those folks twitter, apparently it was the secret service 's decision b/c of a security concern. <p> AnotherTumblrUser <p> Secret Service would be the correct term if Romney were president. He 's not. If his security people were holding people back from leaving instead of redirecting them to a different exit, then that 's just as bad. Any event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle people who want to leave and still keep Governor Romney safe. <p> Guest <p> The Secret Service protects major presidential and vice presidential candidates and their spouses within 120 days of a general presidential election. <p> I stand corrected. But I still stand by my statement that any type of security should help to redirect people who wish to leave if they( the security) has decided that one exit ca n't be used, assuming that 's the case in this particular instance. <p> asdf <p> Presidential hopefuls receive Secret Service Protection as well, Romney has had it since January or February. <p> Sigrid1 <p> Children 's bodies do n't regulate temperature at the same rate as adults. Do you not feel the slightest compassion for the children of your own political tribe? You would also throw them under the bus of political ambition. Wow! I am so glad I am a Dem. tonight. <p> Bystander <p> Children are warmer than adults because they have less body mass to heat up. <p> journalist <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the statement you just did. That shows America where it 's headed if Romney wins. The children are cold and want to leave and you 're going to tell them they ca n't? I 'm sorry but fuck that and fuck you and I hope you do not have children. This is unbelievable. <p> Jim Olson <p> Again, proving that Republicans care so very much for children while they are still in utero, but the minute they 're born they simply do not care. <p> Billyrouth2000 <p> You wo n't have children because you 'll just murder them first. <p> Surly <p> No, children gain or lose heat faster than adults do because they have a higher surface area to volume ratio. <p> Marbry8 <p> Welcome to Mitt Romney 's world. You are there to serve his purposes regardless of your own needs. <p> Nomail <p> Why did n't anyone call the police to let them know they were being held? <p> Arikado <p> Police would make the situation worse and would probably end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> I was there. This rally was well run and full of people who willingly attended. Police all over the place, which is why I do n't believe any part of the story. I had the sense to leave around 6 before it got too cold for my kids. Other people are n't as smart. She was probably trying to exit right when the secret service was coming through with Romney and they had to hold her off a few minutes. It was absolutely not cold enough for frost bite either. So your headline is completely ridiculous. <p> pacificferret <p> It 's you versus many other news outlets running with the same story. It is what it is. Do n't even try to lie about this. The sources are already confirmed and the story is spreading fast. <p> And I suppose when my boss threatened to FIRE anyone who did not go to Romney 's rally on Friday( West Allis, WI), that was n't actually being forced? <p> EdM01 <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalminers in Ohio who were REQUIRED to attend an Rmoney campaign rally without pay or get fired. <p> MontanaSid <p> Your proof is where? Unions built this country and made it what it is! You are just envious because you are stuck in your $8 an hour job. <p> Heneedham <p> I was at that rally... it 's NOT freezing and you ca n't get hypothermia UNLESS you WERE N'T DRESSED APPROPRIATELY. Whos fault is that? Should n't parents be dressing their children for the weather? If you made the decision to attend this event, you knew how long you were going to be outside in cold temperatures. DO N'T BLAME OTHER PEOPLE FOR A SELECT FEW PEOPLE 'S MISTAKES. <p> Katkenwilson <p> Your reply is so Republican. " I dressed correctly for the event. I ca n't help it if others were n't as smart as me! " You 've got yours, do n't worry about anyone else. Such selfish, naval-gazing, self-righteous cartoons parading around as human beings. You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not scorn, for others. Are you a " good christian " too? <p> hollywoodstein <p> Little kids have more surface area to body mass, and can get hypothermic even when dressed in winter clothes. <p> hollywoodstein <p> Because children make all the decisions. <p> Jim Olson <p> Irrelevant. If people want to leave, they should be allowed to do so. Especially if the children were cold. More evidence that you are all so, so concerned for children from conception to birth, but you do not care one bit for their welfare once they 're born. And, for the record, children can become hypothermic even in moderate temperatures. <p> Keira <p> When you 're a child you can! <p> Bystander <p> Children are naturally warmer than adults because they have less body mass to heat up. So, nice try. <p> http : **27;4183;TOOLONG Jayelle <p> Forget the frostbite/hypothermia thing. It does n't matter if you 're just leaving because the kids are bored and whiny or you 're feeling bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should be allowed to leave. If not, they are galloping hypocrites when they talk of " freedom.

Of course, if you chose to pull your head out of your butt and read some polls and some literature other than right-wing twaddle, ie. reality, you wo n't be so surprised when it happens. <p> Heidi <p> Katkenwilson, yes... johnlincolnhawk feels brave when spewing his racist ignorace while hiding behind a computer screen and yes.. with the protection of anonymity! <p> A Hoo <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer even attempt to hide their racism. Honesty -- makes for a change. <p> I 'm ashamed to call you fellow " Americans ". <p> Johnlincolnhawk <p> haha <p> pacificferret <p> Why you heartless fuck. Those are the children of members of YOUR Party! Why the hell are YOU laughing. Kill yourself. Immediately. <p> I can imagine the look on your face when President Obama wins a second term on Tuesday and that makes ME say " haha. " <p> EdM01 <p> Laughing at members of your OWN PARTY. Just goes to show your Party 's elites think its conservative white working-class base is expendable, utterly. <p> UncleBucky <p> And the same* for Romney in front of the unpaid coal miners at that rally. <p> The same* meaning, people being forced to add to the numbers at Rmoney 's rally. <p> ComradeRutherford <p> Who cares how many children have to die for Rmoney to get the perfect photo op! And Rmoney 's staff is just as heartless and cruel as Rmoney is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted Rmoney, then you are a sociopath. <p> Naja pallida <p> Just a taste of the new Romney America, where unlawful imprisonment is n't. <p> cmcc <p> Obama has been unlawfully imprisoning people his whole term. Are n't you paying attention? How about blaming Libya attacks on that stupid internet video, knowing the whole time it was a lie? He put that man in prison for making a movie and posting it on the internet. Since when is that legal? Obama is giving weapons to terrorists who will use them to come after us. Wake up!! Obama is dangerous! Vote him out! He has already told Putin that he will be able to talk to him more freely about disarmament after the election, when it does n't matter what the American people think about his policies. HE IS A BAD MAN <p> Naja pallida <p> And the alternative is to vote in someone who has promised to be even more belligerent, ignorant, and dangerous. Genius! <p> hollywoodstein <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides to every story and it looks like you are only watching the Faux News version. As for this story... it 's on the internet so it MUST be real, do n't you know that? SMH <p> http : **35;4271;TOOLONG... Hope Novak <p> Hello. The man was put in jail because he violated his parole. He was not supposed to have anything to do with filming or doing anything on the internet. It had NOTHING to do with the movies content. <p> http : **26;4308;TOOLONG Pritty.Brains <p> Wow, the GOP has really done a job on you. Brainwashed drivel. <p> shell517nj <p> You 've been PUNKED! <p> An Anfgfdgfg <p> I think you really want to say " he 's a black man " and that is n't okay by you. Nice job. <p> Jim Olson <p> Seriously. Just call 911 and get the police there. There are already lots of cameras. <p> http : **26;4336;TOOLONG BeccaM <p> And this is how Mitt Romney treats his supporters? <p> Words fail me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 foot wide exit well lit. <p> You definitely got stopped if you tried to cut behind the Romney bus exit route which was well guarded. <p> You would have to be disoriented not to find an exit. People were leaving all night with kids as it got quite cold <p> Quilla <p> Someone should call 911. From this planet it looks like, say, child endangerment or unlawful imprisonment... film at 11. <p> anon <p> While I would agree under other circumstances, like someone pointed out the cops may do more harm then good. A lot of the times in big groups cops may pepper spray ralliers who are getting angry and belligerent and may accidently hurt a child in the process.
