5086941 <p> Cruelty takes different forms in different genocides. An anthropologist examines the ways in which Rwandan beliefs about health and sickness influenced the particular forms of torture and cruelty during the Rwandan genocide. <p> Techniques of cruelty vary from genocide to genocide. The forms of violence directed at particular groups are different from situation to situation. Even though the Holocaust, Rwanda and Bosnia were all genocides, the particular ways in which the Jews, the Tutsis and the Bosnian Muslims were treated were different. <p> Killing is killing, but the way persons are killed can carry meaning beyond the mere utility of the act. In fact, the ways people are killed or tortured can communicate messages that fit hand-in-glove with the larger meaning of the conflict. Before two people can effectively talk to each other they have to share a common language( a common set of symbols, common grammar, common schemes for meaning, etc). In order for murder and torture to communicate, the particular ways in which these atrocities are carried out have to draw from a common language of symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store of symbols and myths we can begin to understand why violence and torture take the forms they do. <p> Genocide in Rwanda : Flows and Blockages <p> Taylor spent years as an anthropologist in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide studying popular medicine. He says that one of the primary metaphors that the Rwandan people( both Hutu and Tutsi) use to make sense of health/sickness and fertility/infertility is the metaphor of " flow. " <p> Flow is a potent and complex metaphor, applying to the physical body, social relationships and the larger Rwandan political body. <p> A healthy body is a body in which the flow( often of bodily fluids) is well regulated. Sickness is often assumed to be a result of an obstruction or blockage of some sort. Contrariwise, sickness may also result of an unregulated or out of control flow( as in diarrhea or hemorrhage). The body is a conduit and one of the first rights of passage for a Rwandan baby celebrates the baby 's ability to defecate -- what passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The conceptual link between flow and physical health is also evident in the fact that Rwandan sorcery often targets the flows of bodily fluids( blood, fertility fluids) in magical attacks. <p> The metaphor of flow also applies to social relationships. It is, first, an image of social reciprocity. A person must be able to receive and also give. What passes to a person should also pass through the person to others. Flow also plays into inter-family relationships. Relationships among families are built on the flow of daughters in marriage. The importance of the image of flow to these relationships is clear in the interplay between the literal meaning of the Kinyarwanda term gusiba inzira -- " to block the path " -- and its common meaning, " to lose a daughter through death. " Similarly, in earlier Rwandan society, girls who reached child bearing age, but had insufficient " flow " --either in the form of no menstruation or lack of breasts( flow of breast milk) --were put to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both cases, not only did obstructed flows indicate disease in the girl 's body but also blocked " paths " among families on which social relationships were built. <p> Sacred Kingship <p> How does the health of the physical body relate to beliefs about the health of the political body? <p> Symbols are messy things and societies can not be hermetically sealed. The twin images of flow/obstruction do not have the currency in post-colonial Rwandan political society that they did before Rwandan independence in the time of sacred kingship( the last Rwandan king was overthrown in 1959). But, societies have long symbolic and mythic memories and it is from the time of the sacred kingship, in the rituals of the king, the dynastic poetry and the popular narratives about these kings that we find the metaphors of flow and obstruction played out most clearly in the political sphere. <p> Like the child whose body must be a conduit to be healthy, the role of the king was to drink the sacred power, inaana, from heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production, consumption and fertility flowing was the most important ritual function of the king. He was a " flowing being " --a sort of " lactating " male. Periodically, the king carried out an important river ritual to renew the dynasty. The importance of flow in the river ritual is obvious. <p> But, the power of sacred kingship derived not just from the king 's ability to protect and facilitate flow. His power also came from his ability to obstruct -- the opposite of flow. In Rwandan folklore, " obstructive beings " were a source of evil. For instance, in Rwandan myth, Death came to people through an old( non-lactating, non-menstruating) woman. The logic of political power as an obstructive force is simple : if your enemies are obstructive beings, then you defeat your enemies by obstructing their life-giving flows. You obstruct the obstructing beings. The salience of obstructing flow in the enemy is clear from the practice of hanging the genitals of enemy combatants on the drum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill members of an enemy army. It was important to show that the king had obstructed the flow( the seminal virility) of the enemy. In times of extreme crisis even the king 's own death may be called for since it was clear( judging from the health of the society) that he had become an obstructive being to the people. <p> So, the metaphors of flow/obstruction and their relation to health were clear not only at the level of individual bodies and interfamily relationships, but at the level of the body politic as well. <p> Forms of Violence that Control Flows <p> How do the metaphors of flow and obstruction help us to understand the particular forms that cruelty and torture took in the Rwandan genocide? Killing and torture, like all other forms of human activity, can be used not only to accomplish a particular task, but to communicate at the same time. In the same way that an American 's car is as much a statement( to themselves and others) as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tortured can express meanings that otherwise have nothing to do with the action. <p> Tutsis and moderate Hutus were not just killed in the Rwandan genocide. There were patterns. They were often killed in particular places and in particular ways. <p> Rivers <p> Rivers are an obvious embodiment of the metaphor of flow. Historically, this connection was played out in the river ritual of the sacred king. But, the river as metaphor also found its place in the genocide. <p> French colonialists imagined the Tutsis as descendants of Ethiopians to the north. Lon Mugesera, a leader of the rabidly anti-Tutsi MRND( Mouvement rpublicain national pour la dmocratie et le dveloppement) party, neatly tied river, genocide and the supposed Ethiopian foreignness of the Tutsi together in an inflammatory speech leading up to the genocide. <p> "... Why are we waiting to get rid of these Tutsi families?... We have to take responsibility into our own hands and wipe out these hoodlums... The fatal mistake we made in 1959 was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going to find them a shortcut to get there by throwing them into the Nyabarongo River which flows northward. I must insist on this point. We have to act. Wipe them all out! " <p> Mugesera repeated the same message in a number of venues and his words were taken to heart. Rwandan rivers were conscripted into the genocide. In June, July and August of 1994 when the genocide was fully underway, thousands of bodies began washing up on the shores of Lake Victoria, carried there by the Nyabarongo and Akagera rivers. <p> In a sense, the rivers became Rwandan society 's organ for excreting the hated Tutsi. <p> " Blocking the Path " <p> Nazis, obsessed as they were with the " infection " of Aryan blood by inferior Jewish blood, chose showers as their favored locus for murder. Hutus, drawing on the deeply held myth and power of obstructing the obstructing beings, murdered their victims most often at roadblocks and checkpoints. <p> At an instrumental level, murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to catch your enemy on roads or paths where they travel. However, the way that Hutus used roadblocks went far beyond what would make sense if the only point was killing people. Survivors tell of up to 40 roadblocks or checkpoints within 100 meters. If the point was to extract bribes from those fleeing the violence, then those manning later checkpoints were clearly out of luck. What money or valuables would be left after 20 or 30 checkpoints on the same road? <p> Additionally, the way the roadblocks were set up defied any sort of military logic. The genocide was stopped by the advancing Rwandan Patriotic Front( RPF) forces( militarized Tutsi refugees who had been forced into exile in Uganda) in July 1994. The proliferation of roadblocks by Hutus diverted manpower that could have been directed against the RPF. The " logic " of the roadblocks was not instrumental, it was symbolic. It was an effort by Hutus to obstruct the Tutsis who, they believed, were obstructing the health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of using obstruction to fight the enemy : cutting the Achilles tendons of the enemy. Again, while this method of immobilizing the enemy makes some sense. They ca n't escape and if there are too many to kill at once then you can come back at your leisure to kill them. But, like the use of roadblocks, the way that this method of attack was used defied instrumental logic. Hutu military and militias cut the tendons of infants, infirm, crippled and those who were confined to hospital beds -- in short, people who could not have run away. Cattle likewise had their Achilles tendons cut and were left to slowly die in the fields. At the level of simply accomplishing the goal of genocide, these acts go beyond reason. But, seen in light of the logic of obstructing those who obstruct, the cruelty makes sense. <p> The Body As a Conduit <p> One of the most vivid ways that the related metaphors of flow/obstruction were manifest in the Rwandan genocide was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaled from anus to mouth on wooden or bamboo poles. Tutsi women were impaled from vagina to mouth. Beyond the sheer ability of this method of cruelty to terrify the targeted group, the method of murder communicated powerful messages. First, it linked to the notion of a healthy body as one in which the flow of bodily fluids was proper. Violently " obstructing " the alimentary canal not only killed the victim, but communicated a message of power : the obstructing being had been obstructed. Second, it brought to mind the practice of impaling cattle thieves( in force in precolonial and early colonial times). As cattle exchanges accompanied major social transitions and relationships( like patron-client relationships, blood brotherhood and marriage), the free flow of cattle was critical to a healthy Rwandan society. Impaling cattle thieves was a way of dramatizing " blocking " those who " blocked the path. " <p> Impaling victims was not the only form of cruelty and torture that tied back into the flow/obstruction metaphor. Harking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the drum of the sacred king, Tutsi men were often emasculated. Women had their breasts cut off and genitals cut off. The fact that these brutal practices were intended to do more than simply harm the victim is clear from accounts of the severed organs of the victims being hung on poles outside their homes by the perpetrators. The atrocities were meant to communicate within a particular Rwandan idiom. <p> Techniques of Cruelty <p> Atrocities in the Rwandan genocide were not limited to those described above. Many murders were much more mundane( simply instrumental) or drew from other metaphors and sources( from Nazi theories to Hollywood movies). Some showed influences of the Christianity of the colonizers( e.g., crucifixion). The point is that the flow/obstruction metaphors were not the only sources upon which Hutus drew to carry out acts of genocide. They were, however, key sources for the form of atrocities common in the Rwandan genocide. <p> This should not be taken to mean that particular techniques of cruelty issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Just as people use the common tools of language to creatively produce statements tailored to fit their immediate needs, so it is with cruelty, torture and murder. Actions can not only accomplish specific goals( like genocide), but they can be carried out in such a way that they " make sense " both to the perpetrators and victims. <p> Data and Methods : <p> Data Sources : <p> Based on anthropological field work in Rwanda. <p> Funding Sources : <p> Not reported. <p> Full Text Availability : <p> The book in
