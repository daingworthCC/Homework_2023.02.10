5057341 <p> Even as Quinn and Santana slowly made their way downstairs, they heard raised voices and could see from the stairwell Brittany sitting in the lounge chair with Rachel sitting sideways in her lap with her legs hanging over one armrest. Their arms were wrapped around each other and they were nodding excitedly. They were so caught up in their conversation that they clearly had no idea that they were being overheard and Quinn and Santana stopped to listen. <p> " I know right? Just the thing. I 'll hold the periscope 's... wheelhouse steady while you use the calibradon. " <p> " Hold it tight. " <p> " Obviously. This operation needs precision. " <p> " I 'm all over it. " <p> The girls on the stairs watched as the other girls paused and tightened their grip on each other. <p> " Do you think it 's working, Brittany? " <p> " I 'm adjusting it... just another few turns and I think... yes. The angular perpendicularity was 13 degrees off between the primary mirror and the secondary prism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause, because those were real words and optical concepts. <p> " You fixed it! " <p> Brittany shrugged, " De nada. With your help. " <p> " No. You 're the better sub mechanic. " <p> " Well, you were better with the air conditioning thing. " <p> " We all have our different talents. " <p> " Totally! Right? " <p> They grinned at each other winningly even as Santana threw her hands in the air and Quinn said through gritted teeth, " Can anyone come aboard? " <p> Rachel smiled up at the girls descending the stairs, " Brittany just had a flash of mechanical brilliance regarding our periscope! " <p> " Fantastic, " Quinn said, although her voice was strained. <p> Santana cut to the chase, " And you 're mauling my baby, Frodo. " <p> " I respectfully disagree, Santana. Brittany and I were working in the close confines of a submarine and we were merely giving a bit of verisimilitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her hips, " So you 're actually saying if you were fixing a sub you 'd be in each other 's laps? " <p> " It 's method acting. " <p> " There 's going to be a method to my acting out in just a few seconds. " <p> Quinn bit off the words, " Rachel, you need to get out of Brittany 's lap, " and even as she heard the words, Rachel could n't decide whether Quinn had spoken for Santana 's benefit or her own. <p> " Rach is totally cuddly, San, Q, and we were having fun so do n't be mean. " <p> " I know baby but -- " <p> " No buts, San. It 's not sexy hugging -- it makes us happy so I do n't see why you guys are making a big deal out of it. You ca n't say I ca n't hug Rach, San, just because you 're my girlfriend and it makes you jelly for no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super jelly right now but you 're trying not to be mean even though I can see you really want to be. " <p> Question answered, Rachel thought as she hugged Brittany tightly and kissed her on the cheek, " Great save with our periscope and more later, okay? " <p> " Totally. " <p> She got up and stood before Santana and looked from the girl to Quinn, " There. Are you okay now? Are your petty jealousies assuaged by the fact Brittany and I are n't in physical proximity? Or do you not understand I 've never had a real playmate in my life, completely and entirely because of the two of you? Forgive me if you find it difficult to believe that Brittany and I like to play and are affectionate by nature and can regulate and relegate our affections based upon our other relationships. I assume I 'm your ride home, Santana, Brittany? I 'll be upstairs. " <p> " But before we leave, Quinn? We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room. " <p> As the girl charged up the stairs, Brittany 's face fell and Santana winced. <p> As Quinn entered her bedroom, she saw Rachel pacing back and forth but as she closed the door behind her, Rachel stopped and pointed at her. " What are you thinking, Quinn? " <p> Quinn did n't answer. <p> " Tell me you 're actually thinking that Brittany and I are having some clandestine affair. " <p> " Of course not! " <p> Rachel glared at Quinn, " So you do know that my relationship with Brittany is friendly and affectionate and yet you 're still angrily jealous? May I repeat? Me and BRITTANY? Who would n't hurt you for the world, although apparently you imagine I would? " <p> Quinn felt like her head would explode at this but she lowered her voice and whispered hoarsely, " Hello, princess? You just brought me back from a therapy session to address a lot of stuff including exactly the issue of my possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's too hard for you after ten years, I 'm sure I 'll continue to fuck up so often you wo n't need to schedule reminders or you 'll quickly get so tired of me we wo n't need to schedule anything at all. " <p> Rachel looked into Quinn 's eyes and although she was angry, she was n't so angry that she could n't understand that the whole Brittany thing was, yet again, a knee-jerk reaction on Quinn 's part or that the girl felt honest anguish for that reaction. Nor angry enough to change her mind about what she 'd been considering from the moment that she 'd kissed Quinn so passionately. This was all clearly going to be complex between them until it was n't. " Your explanation is noted and appreciated. Change of subject? " <p> " Gladly. " <p> Quinn was expecting something somewhat dire but Rachel surprised her. " I was thinking that if I 'm going to be kissing you so often and giving you hickeys and fondling your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a more formal declaration of my intentions toward you. " <p> Most of the tension left Quinn 's body as she half-smiled, " What do you mean? " <p> " This is probably such a bad idea and way too soon but I need for you to feel secure and I think if we 're going to be... like this... I should ask you whether you 'd consider being my girlfriend. " <p> Quinn literally felt her heart flop around in her chest. " I 've been your girlfriend from the moment you threw up on me, Rachel. I think the question is whether you 'd consider being mine. " <p> " I 'm going to ignore your lovely memories of my regurgitation. But yes. Both to the consideration and the question. " <p> " And you 're not just asking because I 'm an insecure basket-case and you feel guilty because you felt me up? " Although this was phrased as if it were a joke, Rachel understood it was a sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your girlfriend. " <p> Quinn smiled, " So we 're dating? " <p> " When you finally gin up the courage to ask me on a date and I inevitably accept, then yes. " <p> " So I 'm the boy in this scenario? " <p> Rachel shrugged, " Well, you are taller and more aggressive. " <p> " I think we could debate the more aggressive part. I 've seen you in Glee. " <p> Only the fact that Quinn 's eyes were serious and suddenly filled with anxiety as she nodded kept Rachel from laughing in astonishment at this surreal twist in the conversation. As she flashed through what she imagined of the girl 's religious upbringing, she reached out and ran a thumb gently over her cheek. <p> " Jesus is n't bothering me, Quinn. I love and revere Him as someone I personally consider one of history 's greatest moral teachers, a fellow Jew and the one my daddy considers his saviour. As a Jew, I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daddy do but every thought I have of Him is positive. I know that 's not the case for you but I 've read the New Testament many times and you need n't fear Him. He loves you. " <p> She tapped the girl gently on the nose. <p> " And beside that? The King James version of the Bible is, as you should know, a greater influence on the Western literary canon than even Shakespeare. You ca n't help but know a lot of it even if you have n't read it, and I have read it. I promise you Jesus is n't hounding me because we 're in love. " <p> " Hounding. Funny you should use that word. My father made me feel like Jesus was a pitbull in the sky. " <p> " If Jesus is who you Christians purport him to be? Again? You need n't fear Him. He 's the good shepherd and you 're a beloved member of His flock. Your father was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual concerns will never be dumb to me, baby. And if you want to talk about them, I 'll always listen. " She rested her hand on Quinn 's right shoulder. " Are you sure that you do n't believe your homosexuality is a sin? That our relationship is a sin? " <p> Quinn adjusted herself slightly on her crutches as she considered this. " I 'm completely convinced it 's not a sin. But when you said that about quoting Jesus? That caught me off-guard and I totally thought, oh my God, Jesus is watching my girlfriend. I guess that 's just one more habitual anxiety reaction I can deal with in therapy. " <p> Rachel gently shook Quinn 's shoulder. " Again? If Jesus is who you believe Him to be? I know he 's watching me. And I promise you He loves me. He might want to smite me occasionally for my ego but, even in my faith, His father created me and I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled down into warm brown eyes. " I think I am, too. And on that whole girlfriend note? Does that mean I get to kiss you? " <p> Rachel immediately moved toward her but Quinn pulled back. " No, Rachel. Actually? I get to kiss you. As you said, I 'm the boy. " <p> " You 're the goy. " <p> " That too. " <p> The kiss Quinn gave Rachel was passionate but it was also incredibly gentle and tender and completely unlike what they 'd shared before. <p> When Quinn ended it, Rachel blinked. " Uh. Okay. Wow? " She shook her head. " You 're exceptionally good at that but I 'm big enough to immediately admit that I now know you 're the girlier girl in this relationship. " <p> " Yes. I already knew that. But I admire your willingness to concede you were wrong. " <p> " I did n't say I was wrong. I merely -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love. I want you to feel it. " <p> Rachel sighed dreamily, " I feel it, like, all over. And I just said like, which is unlike me. " <p> " I broke you. " <p> " If we did n't have other people to tend to, you could break me again. " <p> Quinn kissed her on the forehead. " You 're my girlfriend. " <p> " And you 're mine. That 's completely bizarre. " <p> " I 'll say. But we 're figuring out what that means and we 're not ready to tell the world. Does that go without saying? " <p> " You said it. " <p> Rachel hugged Quinn tightly, " You owe Brittany an apology. " <p> " I know. " <p> " And fair warning? I will be as appropriately affectionate as I want to with Brittany. Get used to it. Got it? " <p> " Got it -- let 's get to it. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for them in the foyer. <p> Quinn led the way, " Brit Brit? I 'm sorry about the whole jelly thing. I 'm going to a doctor to get better about being so mean, okay? " <p> Brittany grinned, " That 's super good, Q, because you 're only mean because you 're sad all the time and that has to hurt more than your foot even, right? " <p> Rachel looked up gratefully at the girl forcing an abrupt conversational detour, staring down at Santana to accept it even as she said, " Yes, Brittany, on our way home, we can stop for ice cream. " <p> Santana looked into Brittany 's eyes, then glared at Rachel and pointed at Quinn, " You 'd better fucking note the fact I took the T out of the word bitch in addressing our hobbit just now and that was just for you, Q. And you do n't eat ice cream, Frodo. " <p> " I do n't but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear God, Quinn thought. It was sweet of Rachel to say but she dropped her head even as Santana 's glare turned into a leer. When she looked up, Santana said, " She opened the door, Q. So, for reals? She deserves for me to walk right through. You already had a little something sweet today, Rachel? What 's that? " <p> Rachel looked from Quinn to Santana and back to Quinn. And stamped her foot. " You told her! " <p> Quinn raised both hands as best she could over her crutches. " I changed into a turtleneck, Rachel. She noticed and asked. I told. She 's my best friend. " <p> Brittany responded, " It 's so not like I 'm not used to this but I know I 'm missing something. " <p> Quinn did n't even bother to move as Santana stepped forward and pulled her turtleneck down. Brittany stared at the damage and nodded. " That 's totally sweet, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San are women of color. Q and I are really pale Caucasians and even for Caucasians we both bruise super easy since forever, okay? " <p> Rachel nodded in complete mortification. <p> Brittany lowered her voice, " You know I 'm like in my cheer costume all the time so I ca n't be bruised all over, right? So the best thing to do is just lick Q really hard. It still feels really nice. I mean, it 's not exactly as fun but it does n't leave marks. That 's what San does until the off-season. " <p> The three girls surrounding Brittany were blushing ferociously and begging internally for Brittany to end their misery in their minds. Which she did. " I think Q needs to get off her foot, S. " <p> " Does this mean you and Rach are girlfriends or are you just friends with sexy times? " <p> Quinn thought ' leave it to Brittany to just ask the big question even she and Rachel had n't handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy times, for the time being. I need to go to the doctor more and get better before all that. " <p> " Because, like San said, you 're going to a sad doctor to help make you happy? " <p> " Yes. " <p> " Good. I 'm glad. " <p> " Me too, B. You guys get going. Rach? Call me later? " <p> Rachel grabbed her bag from the floor of the foyer, " I certainly will. And since the cat 's out of the bag? " <p> She pulled Quinn into a quick, gentle kiss. " I love you -- get off that leg and tell your mother goodbye for us. " <p> " Will do. And love you back. And I love you, S, even though you 're a bish right back and I super love you B. " <p> Where Brittany came up with half the stuff she said, which was often wildly accurate, was a mystery to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a disturbingly long line for Ohio in the winter. Go figure, Santana thought as she gave Brittany a ten-dollar bill and said, " You know what I want, ice cream-wise, baby. And I wants to have a quick talk with our hobbit. " <p> Brittany nodded and said, " I 'll order it but you have to be nice, San or -- " <p> " I know! You already told me. Three scoops for you. " <p> Santana sat across from a booth with Rachel but leaned forward, motioning for Rachel to do the same. As Rachel leaned forward, Santana spoke quietly, " Here 's the deal, hobby. There are many definitions of the word ese, which sort of, kind of can be translated from something like, " Wassup, ese, " to " What 's up, dude? " It has other connotations, however, and the most common usage is derived from male Mexican-American gang culture. As such? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Latina woman who 's not Mexican. I totally get you thought you know a cool Spanish reference but it hit me wrong, okay? I promise I 'm not hatin ' on Mexicans but I 'm mixed-breed Lesbian enough. I do n't need to be called what I 'm not. " <p> " I apologize. I did n't mean any offense. " <p> " Some taken initially -- but taken totally back. I understand you did n't know. Apology accepted. And listen. About the whole Britts thing? I 'm not used to anyone loving her like our parents or me and Q do... so it 's like... " <p> " I understand. " <p> " I do n't think you do. " <p> Rachel looked into eyes as dark as her own. " Santana? I understand. You suddenly have someone else who only wants the best for her. Who loves her. I know that must be weird for you and maybe you think I ca n't cut it? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl across from her, " I 'm tougher than both you and Quinn put together. Nothing either of you have ever done to me over ten years has diminished me in any way. You can hurt me all you want to, and you so have, but I will always win because I 'm stronger than both of you in every way except the physical. And now Brittany has me completely on her side. " <p> Rachel pulled a paper napkin from its dispenser and began to clean the tabletop. <p> " Remember that extends to you and Quinn. I 'd bet you think I 'm the winner here, right? Because I 've gained high school bullshit-protection from you? Think twice, Santana. I appreciate you but I 've had my Kevlar on since the day you walked into my life. You 're the winners in this equation. Because now you have my affection and trust and protection. I sincerely apologize again for my ham-handed cultural reference but you need to step back if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about me. " <p> She stopped cleaning and looked Santana in the eyes. " It never would. I 'm Rachel Berry. Bottom line? I will always stand in front of whatever life throws at Quinn or Brittany. You have someone standing with you between life and them. And I will always win, even if sometimes you three might lose. I promise you that 's true. " <p> " Rocky Road, San! " Brittany announced as she slid into the booth next to the girl and handed her the cone. <p> " What a perfect choice for Santana, " Rachel said as she looked at Brittany 's cone. " What 's that, Brittany? " <p> " Mint chocolate chip. It 's my favorite. I could have gotten three scoops like San said but it makes me crazy anxious when I do because it melts so fast so two 's enough. With two scoops, you just eat the top and jam the rest in the cone with your tongue. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like melting and licking, right? And that
