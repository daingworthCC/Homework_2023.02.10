5092741 <h> Rick Perry Has Three Strikes Against Him <p> Rick Perry 's already lackluster presidential bid went on a deathwatch after his debate debacle. In talking to the many who have known Perry over the years, fellow Texan Bryan Burrough discovers the surprising reasons behind the campaign 's train wreck and how Perry, with an unbroken string of nine political victories, might yet stage a comeback -- despite his shocking backroom dealings with big campaign donors, the rumors about gay affairs and painkiller use, and the nasty bullying tactics he has used to implement a truly radical agenda. <p> I n the history of modern presidential debates, it may go down as the single most humiliating moment since Senator Lloyd Bentsen informed Senator Dan Quayle that he was " no Jack Kennedy. " Except this time the damage was self-inflicted. <p> Rick Perry, the impossibly handsome three-time governor of Texas, the man who three months before had seemed on the verge of being anointed the likely Republican presidential nominee, had already seen his poll numbers plummet from as high as 38 percent to lows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to avoid them during his campaigns in Texas -- in fact, he managed to win his last term without agreeing to a single one. And now it was easy to see why : Perry had done so poorly in a string of G.O.P. debates all through September and October, stumbling and bumbling and unsure, that his people had actually suggested he might bow out of future contests. <p> But he could n't do that, not with his campaign on life support, and so there he was, on a mid-November Wednesday night in Rochester, Michigan, launching into yet another diatribe against the Washington bureaucracies he promised to eliminate as president. " I will tell you, it 's three agencies of government, when I get there, that are gone, " Perry told the panel of moderators and a national television audience. He turned to his left, where Ron Paul, the former congressman, was listening politely, and began to tick the agencies off with his fingers. <p> " Commerce, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... " <p> Suddenly a look of confusion crossed the governor 's face. A smile of mild embarrassment immediately replaced it. He pointed his finger to his temple. <p> " What 's the third one there? Let 's see. " <p> Laughter erupted from the audience. Perry turned to Ron Paul, as if seeking help. Paul raised five bony fingers. <p> " Seriously? " one of the moderators, the journalist John Harwood, asked. " Is E.P.A. the one you were talking about? " <p> Again Perry appeared confused. " No, sir ; no, sir, " he said. " We were talking about the agencies of government -- E.P.A. needs to be rebuilt. There 's no doubt about that. " <p> " But you ca n't? " Harwood began. " You ca n't name the third one? " <p> " The third agency of government, " Perry said. <p> " Yes, " Harwood said. <p> " I would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the, ah, Commerce, and, let 's see... I ca n't. The third one. I ca n't. Sorry. " His smile finally disappeared. In its place came a sheepish look. <p> The last word Rick Perry spoke was " Oops. " <p> " Oops, " in fact, would be an adequate summary of the Texas governor 's entire campaign. The morning after Perry 's epic brain freeze, the pundits were all but declaring his candidacy dead. In The New York Times, the consultant Mark McKinnon called it " the human equivalent of the shuttle Challenger. " <p> " I knew people who just could n't watch, " says Cragg Hines, a former Washington- bureau chief of the Houston Chronicle. " It was just such a creepy moment. Your heart said, There he goes. It 's over. He 's dead. It had a car wreck aspect to it. " <p> " It was agonizing to watch, whether you liked him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Austin and a longtime Perry observer. " Is he dead? Never say never, but it would have to be one of the greatest comebacks in history. " <p> W hat on earth happened to Rick Perry? When he an-nounced his candi-dacy, in mid-August, he vaulted overnight to the top of the Republican field, turning the race into what many assumed would be a two-man contest with Mitt Romney, the onetime Massachusetts governor. Buoyed by a strong Texas economy, a darling of Tea Party activists, and never having lost a single race during his 27-year career, Perry, for a moment at least, appeared unstoppable. His honeymoon, however, proved brutally brief. First came his suggestion that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, was somehow " treasonous. " Then came his charge that those who disagreed with his decision to grant educational aid to illegal immigrants had no heart. And then, worst of all, those debates, where he looked for all the world as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when The Washington Post disclosed that a deer lease where Perry and his father hunted with friends 30 years ago went by the name " Niggerhead " ; the name, it was said, had been painted on a rock at the entrance. By mid-October Perry 's poll numbers had plunged to as low as 6 percent. <p> " Perry is a classic instance of the candidate who is almost literally perfect on paper -- he had the perfect rsum, the perfect story line, the perfect reputation, for Republican insurgents, " muses John Podho-retz, the conservative columnist. " All he had to do was make a respectable showing and he would have been anointed. All he had to do was walk and talk and chew gum and he would have won it. This race was Perry 's to lose. " Podhoretz draws a comparison to Sarah Pa-lin 's performance in 2008 : " Perry is a lot like Palin. Palin was ill-prepared ; she did n't look like she knew what she was talking about, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time, people on the right are in no mood to do it again. " <h> The Harder They Fall <p> I n Austin, where Perry has emerged as the longest-serving -- and probably the most powerful -- governor in Texas history, everyone has a different theory about why he has fared so poorly in the early rounds of the presidential campaign. His team, most of whom have been at Perry 's side for a decade or more, is considered very tight, very skillful, and very controlling ; they do n't leak, and, in Texas elections at least, they do n't make many mistakes. Their zeal for control, however, means that Perry has given fewer press interviews over the years than many governors. He has thus never been forced to develop the conversational polish that televised debates and interviews demand. <p> Another explanation, typically voiced only in whispers, is that for all Perry 's obvious political strengths -- his popularity with conservatives, excellent political instincts and timing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair -- he simply may not be the sharpest tool in the shed. After watching him march up the political ladder the last 20 years, few in Austin believe Perry possesses any genuine intellectual curiosity ; at Texas A &M,; his academic record was littered with C 's. " A &M; was full of these guys like Rick from tiny towns who wanted to be vets -- none of them had a chance, " recalls Don Mauro, an Austin attorney who was a member of Perry 's class. " It was n't that Rick was stupid. It was that he came from a high school class of 13 people. He had no education. I mean, Rick is not dumb. He is just not educated. " <p> But " candidates who are n't that smart can be really good, " points out one Democratic consultant in Austin, " because they stay on message. A guy like Rick, you tell him there are three things you have to say, and it 's all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he can remember them, that is. <p> The most intriguing explanation for Perry 's collapse has been quietly circulating in Austin for weeks. This theory suggests that the governor is suffering from the after-effects of his low-back surgery in July, six weeks before he announced his candidacy ; his surgeon, a friend who operates a Houston " medical day spa " specializing in liposuction and laser hair removal, fused two of Perry 's vertebrae and then injected the governor -- for the first time in the surgeon 's career -- with two teaspoonfuls of stem cells that had previously been cultured from fatty tissue taken from Perry 's hip. <p> " Ever since, and you saw this at the very first debate, he just seemed to be very uncomfortable, you know, twisting his torso, " observes the dean of Texas political writers, Paul Burka of Texas Monthly. " I think he 's got back pain and may be taking medication for it. He is not on his game. He stopped wearing his trademark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back brace. Of course, the campaign denies there is any problem. But he does n't seem to have any energy. He just does not look like the same man to me. It 's shocking. " <p> How does Perry explain his stumbles to date? Lord knows. A young woman in his campaign office politely accepted Vanity Fair ' s request for an interview, saying it would be " put in the file. " After that, not a single e-mail or telephone call was ever returned. <p> Joe Burbank/ Orlando Sentinel /MCT/Getty Images <p> T o many outsiders, especially those who live on the coasts, Perry is just another scary Texas right-winger who talks too much about the Lord Jesus Christ and all the things he learned reading the Bible, who publicly questions evolution and even the validity of Barack Obama 's birth certificate( an issue he has lately backtracked on). The pens of eastern columnists fairly drip with condescension when they stoop to writing about him -- not that they understand much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere and was a hotshot yell leader( the male cheerleaders who lead boisterous crowds at bonfires and athletic contests) at Texas A &M.; If Perry was known outside Texas before the last year, it was as the candidate Karl Rove groomed -- and dropped -- to take on George W. Bush. <p> And while all that may be true, it took more than an evangelical bent and zealous conservatism for Perry to rise in Texas politics. Watching his alternately pugnacious and eerily invisible performances during the fall 's Republican debates, it was easy to forget that, as even his detractors acknowledge, he has always been extraordinarily well liked, ready with a big smile, a firm handshake, excellent manners, and a strong clap on the back -- social niceties many Texans value highly. As a Texan myself, I 've always thought that Perry was so popular because he embodies an idealized version of Lone Star manhood. It 's the boots( one set is emblazoned with the word " liberty "). The dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokin '. It 's that until he entered politics he was an authentic West Texas rancher, a vocation many Texans still find enormously appealing. Above all, though, it 's that craggy western face ; Perry is forever being compared to the Marlboro Man. <p> During his first statewide campaign, for agriculture commissioner, in 1990, " there was a poster of Perry they put out, wearing chaps, feet up on a bale of hay, his crotch front and center, " remembers the lobbyist Bill Miller. " I saw that poster everywhere, in every office I went into, and I thought, This guy is hot. In every sense of the word. " Mil-ler laughs. " I remember having lunch with a liberal lady friend of mine, and she leans over to me and says, ' Bill, do you think Rick Perry puts socks down the front of his pants? ' That 's when I realized he was really getting under some people 's skins. " <p> O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry scores pretty close to a 10 out of 10. " Weather, football, hunting, fishing, all that -- he 's expert at Texas bullshit, " Miller says. " He works hard at being liked, and that 's a big part of his appeal. " Another lobbyist, who has vacationed with Perry aides, says, " He can be the most crass guy you 've ever met. I mean, in public, he 's smooth. But when he 's with the guys? Oh, God, it 's a different program. He tells dirty jokes in a whisper. He 's a whisperer, especially in groups. It 's the old mentality here in Austin, you know, with the old lobbyists. A guy they do n't like comes in the place and they lean over and whisper, ' He 's gay. ' Perry 's got a real locker-room side. " <p> " Perry once said something in my presence that just appalled me, " says Paul Burka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular Democratic Speaker of the Texas House, Pete Laney. " A friend 's daughter was in a softball game, " Burka continues. " Perry asked me to come out with him. To see him with the guys. Perry was late getting there -- he had a doctor 's appointment. So he finally shows up. You know, everyone goes, ' Oh, how 'd it go? ' He goes, ' It was awful. He gave me a Laney, ' meaning an enema. How could he do that? Comparing Pete Laney to an enema? Laney was loved. " <p> That Perry can overplay the machismo card was evident in the skepticism that greeted his story of shooting a coyote. As he told it, the incident occurred last year, when he was jogging with his dog in a rural area of southwest Austin. He claimed -- and has since repeated -- that when the coyote menaced his dog he shot and killed it with a laser-sighted.380 Ruger pistol containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feared rattlesnakes, but even in Texas, many could n't imagine doing such a thing -- never mind the question of how and where one carries a pistol in sweatpants. <p> " We were at a Boy Scout function, and I said to him, ' Rick, man, I have to ask you : Did you really kill that coyote? ' " says Don Mauro. <p> " And he goes, ' Yeah, I did. ' <p> " ' With a pistol? ' <p> " ' Yeah. ' <p> " ' While you were jogging? ' <p> " ' Yeah. ' <p> " ' And it had a laser sight on it? ' <p> " ' Yeah. ' <p> " And then he showed me a picture of the gun, on his phone. I did find that kind of strange, but you know what? He did n't. At all. " <h> Grand Old Party School <p> T his kind of behavior can indeed seem strange, at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from. He is a product of extreme rural Texas in the 1950s and early 1960s, raised on a prairie farm, where he rose early, put on underwear his mother had made by hand, and fed the livestock. He is a fifth-generation Texan, the descendant of a long line of small-time politicians ; a great-great-grandfather moved to the state after fighting for the Confederacy and served in the legislature before settling in Haskell County, 55 miles north of the nearest city, Abilene. Ever since, the Perrys have been ranchers and farmers, prying cotton from the thin soil. Rick 's father, Ray, married his wife, Amelia, in 1947 and, starting out as a tenant farmer on 312 acres, eventually built it into a sprawling farm of 10,000 acres. A county commissioner for 28 years, Ray Perry raised Rick and his sister, Milla, in a 1920s-style bungalow so rickety that Rick has told of dust clouds billowing through the wallboards during windstorms. Paint Creek itself is more an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a church, and a community center. <p> In interviews over the years, Perry has characterized his boyhood as idyllic, given over to farm chores, 4-H fairs, and Boy Scout troop meetings. On a Scout trip to Texas A &M,; he fell in love with the campus, a haven for generations of rural-Texas teenagers, which began accepting women as full-time students only in 1963, five years before Perry 's arrival. Then, as now, student life was dominated by the Corps of Cadets, the gung-ho source of " Aggie " pride, which divided incoming students into an array of military outfits affiliated with the four service branches. Freshmen, known as " fish, " endured boot-camp-style exercise and discipline so harsh that one of Perry 's classmates dropped dead. <p> " My first recollection of Rick was that first day, late August ' 68. Our heads had just been shaved, and they had us in blue jeans and tennis shoes and white T-shirts, teaching us how to stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish, who is now a veterinarian in Jourdanton, Texas. " I look down and he had a rattlesnake belt on, and I said, ' O.K., he 's probably from West Texas. ' Afterward I remember Rick 's father, Ray, walked over to our outfit commander, George Schriever, standing under a little oak tree by the dorm, and said, ' Make a man out of him. ' George shook his hand and said, ' Thank you, sir, we will. ' " <p> " Fish " Perry, as he was known, drew a spartan room, called a " hole, " in Dorm 8, home of Squadron 6, the " Flying Tigers, " which was affiliated with the air force. His hole was adjacent to that of Schriever and his executive officer. When the older cadets banged on the wall, Perry and his roommate had 10 seconds to hustle into their room and do " whatever they wanted : ' Make my bed, ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take off my boots ' -- whatever they say, you do, " Clader recalls. <p> Perry 's closest chum at A &M,; John Sharp, was a student leader who would go on to a long career of his own in Texas politics. Sharp 's favorite tale of their A &M; days, told repeatedly over the years, is of the time he and Perry realized that they could flush an M-80 firecracker down an upstairs toilet in their dormitory, to explode in a downstairs toilet -- a trick for which the two cadets received two weeks of extra duties as punishment. <p> Perry hoped to become a veterinarian, but by his own admission he struggled in his classes, especially organic chemistry. His grade transcripts were lined with C 's and D 's. Vet school began junior year, but near the end of his sophomore year Perry returned to his dorm downcast after meeting with the dean. As Clader recalls, " Rick told me, ' Well, looks like I 'm going to go flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the deal? ' He said, ' Let me tell you what the dean told me. He put his arm around my shoulder and told me, ' Son, you are destined for great things. But they 're not in veterinary science. ' " <p> A &M; was then in the process of wrenching change. There were still only around 1,500 women on a campus of almost 15,000 -- and membership in the Corps was no longer mandatory. Student leaders fell into two camps : those in favor of further modernization and those resisting change, many of them in the Corps, whose shrinking membership found itself on the defensive. Relations between the two sides all but collapsed in Perry 's sophomore year, when a new Corps commander ordained that fish could no long-er speak with either women or civilian students, known as " non-regs. " " There was a tremendous amount of tension between the Corps and the non-regs, " recalls Clader. " This was at a time of long hair and psychedelics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps with shaved heads. It was us against the world. At least that 's how we felt. " <p> " Rick fell in with the Old Guard, " remembers Garry Mauro, a yell leader two years ahead of Perry. " The Corps of Cadets was one of those places where the more extreme you were the, quote, ' better ' you were. That was Rick. You had a hard-core group of people that were really nasty. You 're supposed to speak to everyone on campus. They would n't allow their freshmen to speak to the non-regs, and they did nasty things to women -- not talking to them, ignoring them. Rick was really, really tough about that. " <p> Other student leaders, however, do n't remember Perry as being so combative. Elected his junior and senior years as one of five yell leaders, Perry was prominent on campus but only peripherally involved in student politics. " Rick was one of the traditionalists, it 's true, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac Spears, an Indian-apolis businessman who as a student favored modernization. " He was well liked, not controversial, just a really good guy, " says Kent Caperton, a classmate of Perry 's, who later became a Democratic state representative. " I will say, I do n't think you 'll find any of his classmates that would have predicted he would be a presidential candidate. " Adds Glenn Honaker, who roomed with Perry, " He did n't stand out as a world leader by any means. " <p> U pon his graduation, in 1972, Perry joined the air force, where he was trained as a pilot and was eventually assigned to fly C-130 transport planes. He has since asserted that his travels while in the air force, which took him to South America, Europe, and the Middle East, taught him much about the rest of the world and its governments. In fact, several of those who served with him downplay the amount of time they spent engaging with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. military bases. Perry mingled mostly with friends from A &M; when he was a co-pilot, one of his first pilots had been his superior officer in the Corps of Cadets. " The air force was really more of an extension of A &M; than anything else, " says one old friend. Perry left the air force after five years, returning home to Haskell County in 1977. <p> The next stage of his life, from 1977 to 1983, when Perry turned 33, amounts to his personal dark ages, a time when by his own admission he struggled to determine his life 's direction. In one way it was the classic case of " How you gon na keep ' em down on the farm? " For Perry, who had spent the previous seven years leading crowds of screaming Aggies and flying airplanes around the world, Haskell County seemed insufferably small. He moved back into his childhood bedroom. " Dad still thought I was there to do chores, " he wrote in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that I had just finished commanding a multi-million--dollar piece of government equipment and a number of grown men. He reminded me that the chores still needed tending to. " <p> Within a year, Perry decided to give up ranching to become a pilot for Southwest Airlines. In August 1978, he was poised to join Southwest 's training program when the ranch was inundated by more than two feet of rain in a day. " But we got real busy for one thing. That much rain in a 24-hour period of time does amazing damage to farming and ranchland. So I just made the decision that this is where I need to be, " Perry told the Austin American-Statesman last year. <p> For the next five years Perry worked alongside his father. He married his longtime girlfriend, a nurse named Anita Thigpen, and they moved into a 600-square-foot house outside Haskell. Perry, however, was still not content. As he tells the story, it was after a second bout of severe weather, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged to learn that Haskell 's state representative had decided not to run for re-election. Ray Perry had been involved in county politics for years, but his son 's friends suggest a more likely influence on Rick 's decision to seek the vacant seat was the sheer number of his old A &M; friends who had grown active in Texas politics. <p> ' T he period when Rick was at A &M; was a real breeding ground for state government and public service, " says Roger Miller, an Austin lobbyist and Aggie. " On other campuses there was a dropout mentality in the early 70s, but A &M; was so conservative public service was still seen as a good thing. Especially in that period afterward, in the mid-70s, you had so many A &M; people who served in the House and the Senate. There was this whole Aggie mafia. " At least a half-dozen of Perry 's Corps pals, including his closest friend, John Sharp, were already in the legislature, along with Garry Mauro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray and Amelia, were great supporters of mine when I ran in 1978, " recalls Charlie Stenholm, the former Democratic congressman who then represented the area. " I had never really known Rick. He contacted my district people, and they encouraged him to run. They then said it would be good for me to meet with him. We met in the parking lot at the Iredell Co-op gym, in one of our pickups, either his or mine. We had about a two-hour talk, and I encouraged him to run. We said we would back him in every way, lend him our mailing lists, ask our supporters to support him. And we did, he did, he won. " <h> Right Place, Right Time <p> H is family -- he and Anita have a son, Griffin, and a daughter, Sydney, both now in their 20s -- remained behind in Haskell when Perry attended his first legislative session in Austin, in 1985. He soon attracted notice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of... um... adjusting himself, for which he earned the nickname " Crotch. " In the Texas house, a freshman 's influence is determined by two things, his friendships and his committee assignments. Perry chose his buddies well. Much as he had befriended John Sharp at A &M,; Perry found his two closest Austin friends in a savvy pair of freshmen, Cliff Johnson, of Palestine, and Ric Williamson, of Weatherford ; both would go on to distinguished legislative careers. The three rented an apartment together and found a mentor in Bob Johnson, who tutored them on the fastest ways to rise in the legislature. <p> " I remember my first impression of Rick very clearly, " says Mike Millsap, who served alongside Perry in the House. " What I was struck by was here is a very handsome guy, married to a beautiful woman, who was very popular in the House and just seemed he had it all. He was tremendously well liked. " Millsap pauses for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- they 're people that go back home and sell insurance or work at the pharmacy or practice law. We were all amateurs. But not Rick Perry. From the beginning, Rick was a professional. When I look back on that era, I realize now he was so much better than the rest of us. He had the intensity and the commitment and the drive to carry on. " <p> Perry attracted enough notice during his first term that, after an uncontested re-election in 1986, he earned a spot on the prestigious House Appropriations Committee. There he joined his roommates, Cliff Johnson and Ric Williamson, and a third new friend, Mike Toomey -- later his chief of staff -- to form a group of budget cutters so zealous they were known as " the pit bulls. "( The nickname initially derived from the junior legislators ' seats in the lower level, or pit, of the House room where they regularly met.) <p> S till, by 1989, during Perry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thanks to Ronald Reagan 's popularity, Republicans, until the 1960s an afterthought in the state, were gaining ground in the legislature. A number of prominent conservative Democrats, most notably Senator Phil Gramm, had changed parties. Working with national G.O.P. leaders, Gramm spearheaded a crusade to lure even more, peppering state representatives like Perry with telephone calls at all hours urging them to switch parties. The Texas Democrats ' conservative wing, meanwhile, was dying. Perry and Ric Williamson lost a climactic budget-cutting battle that year ; more often than not, they found themselves voting with the Republicans. Both began talking about switching parties. At a Dallas gathering, a young George W. Bush urged Perry to do it. The turning point, most believed, came when the House Speaker, Gib Lewis, passed Perry over for a committee chairmanship. <p> " He already had the equivalent of his own committee, Appropriations, and I had put him on the Calendars Committee too, " Lewis recalls. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What more could he possibly want? ' " After the Calendars Committee chairman resigned and Lewis chose someone else, Perry was convinced that a conservative Democrat had no future in Texas politics. <p> Perry considered quitting and going home to Haskell County, or becoming another Austin lobbyist. But Phil Gramm promised him he had a shining future in the Texas G.O.P. Finally, Perry, like several of his friends, succumbed, becoming a Republican. " Phil Gramm was all over us like flies on, well, you know, " says Millsap, then Gib Lewis 's chief of staff. " When Rick switched, I remember it quite clearly. I was walking out to my car outside the capitol, and he and Gramm and a bunch of people were setting up their press conference on the steps. I remember feeling a sense of sadness but also a sense of ' What else is new? ' We all sort of shrugged. I do n't think Gib said a word about it. There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> W hat no one understood at the time was that Perry 's decision to switch parties was part of a larger plan orchestrated by the man who would later oversee George W. Bush 's rise to the White House : Karl Rove. Then a Republican campaign consultant based in Austin -- Gramm was one of his most important clients -- Rove had spent the previous decade shepherding Republican candidates, who methodically demolished one Texas Democrat after another. He would suffer a setback in the 1990 elections, however. <p> " Remember, Karl Rove was not Karl Rove then, " says Bill Miller. " He would lose the 1990 governor 's race. He was vulnerable. And Rick was going nowhere in the Democratic Party, I do n't think. He had gone as far as he could go as a Democrat. He was fucked. Just fucked. Karl and Rick, they kind of needed each other at that point. " <p> Rove, in fact, was less interested in Rick Perry 's career than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudest -- liberal Democrat, Jim Hightower. From the unlikely platform of Texas agriculture commissioner, Hightower had grown into a national media darling, a pithy populist who loved ridiculing conservatives. He had won elections in 1982 and 1986 by enormous margins, and until Rove targeted him, there was every sense he would do so again. When Perry announced he would challenge Hightower in the 1990 election, most politicians scoffed. Few outside Austin had ever heard of Perry. <p> During the campaign, Perry and friends like Cliff Johnson crisscrossed Texas, reaching many stops in a battered Cessna that Perry piloted. Back in Austin, Rove crafted a series of negative advertisements that slowly undercut Hightower. The most controversial showed Hightower smiling and posing with Jesse Jackson, whom he supported during Jackson 's 1988 presidential campaign ; underneath were the words " Does Hightower share your values? " The commercial caused a furor in the African-American community, and Hightower later claimed it was racist. But Rove raised enough money to run that and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hightower campaign ran low on funds, they were the only ads on the airwaves. <p> To widespread amazement, Perry won. In 1990 he moved his family to Austin and took over the Agriculture Department, where he busied himself promoting Texas farm products and retooling pesticide regulations. " Agriculture is not a hard job and he did n't really do anything, " says Paul Burka. " He was most notable for surrounding himself with Aggies. He draws that inner circle tight around him. " <p> P erry easily won re-election in 1994 and then, in 1998, told friends he was considering a run for what is arguably the most powerful job in Texas politics, lieutenant governor, which entails supervising the legislative process.( Rove, busy with George W. Bush, brought in a New Hampshire consultant named Dave Carney to run Perry 's campaign ; Carney remains at Perry 's side to this day.) The problem was that Perry 's opponent would be his close friend, John Sharp, then the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deterred. " I got calls from my clients saying, ' Tell Rick we do n't want him to run for lieutenant governor ; tell him to run for comptroller, ' " recalls Bill Miller. " So I called Rick and said, ' I 'm just the messenger. My people say you should run for comptroller. ' His response was ' Fuck that, and fuck them if they do n't want to help me. ' " <p> " The race against Sharp, that was the decisive race in his career, " says Paul Burka. " The story of the race is that Sharp had this killer ad, a retired Texas Ranger saying Rick Perry is soft on crime. At the very end Sharp decided he would pull that ad and go positive. That was the critical moment. " Remembers a Sharp staffer, " Yeah, there was a huge fight over that, but John would n't budge. I do n't think he felt good about attacking Rick. I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. That 's why he won the race. " <p> Perry became the state 's first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction but served only two years, ascending to the governorship when Bush resigned to become president, in December 2000. Despite 16 years in state politics, Perry was " still a mystery to most Texans, " as Texas Monthly noted in a cover story titled, " Can Rick Perry Stand on His Own? " Among Austin political veterans, the article noted, the " standard view " was that Perry was basically a male bimbo : " Does n't know much, has n't done much, does n't articulate much, does n't care about much, would n't have achieved much except for a God-given attribute other than his brain... his looks. " <p> Then, as now, Perry was inevitably compared to his predecessor, George W. Bush, though the two are very different men. Perry and Bush have detested each other for at least a decade ; if anything, a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her husband is. In Austin just about everyone has a different explanation for the Perry-Bush rift. Some trace it to Rove 's heavy-handed insistence that Perry hold off on attack ads in his 1998 race against John Sharp at a time when Bush, then running for governor, wanted to avoid negative campaigning. Others cite Bush 's 1995 refusal to name Perry 's brother-in-law, Joseph Thigpen, to the Texas appeals-court bench. <p> O nce in power, Perry proved an unremarkable administrator. For all his conservative credentials, his single most ambitious project was a conservative 's nightmare( because it would have required that a half-million acres of private land be acquired by eminent domain) : a $175 billion plan to privatize and expand Texas highways, laying commuter rail and telecom pipelines up and down 4,000 miles of roadways ; other than a few highway expansions around Houston and Dallas, most of it died in the legislature. Elsewhere, Perry pushed a hard-core conservative agenda, appointing three consecutive creationists to head the state Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executions of more death-row inmates than any governor in modern history. His main claim to broader fame has been the extraordinary Texas economy, which during his tenure has, as Perry repeatedly contends, created more jobs than almost all the other states combined. Wonderful luck has been a dominant theme of Perry 's career, however, and his critics argue -- convincingly, in some cases -- that Perry did little to create all those new jobs. He was simply lucky enough to govern Texas at a time when the oil-and-gas industry was going through a prolonged expansion. Which is true. But you would be hard-pressed to find a governor anywhere who looks more kindly on big business. <p> Perry got little respect, even after he decisively won the 2002 gubernatorial election. In the legislature especially, the Democratic speaker, Pete Laney, and his top aides all but sneered at the mention of Perry 's name. Perry, in perhaps the most important move of his political career, declared war. " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Paul Burka. " So that first year Perry vetoed 82 bills. Eighty-two bills. No governor in Texas history came even close. He just vetoed everything. It was just one big ' Fuck you. ' After that, well, Perry got pretty much everything he wanted. " <p> Texas Democrats, stunned to be dominated by a politician they thought so little of, scrambled to find dirt on Perry. They found little of use. For years reporters combed through a series of real-estate deals in which Perry reportedly made almost $1.5 million by flipping a series of parcels in the Austin area ; the deals, some assisted by Austin developers, seemed to serve no purpose other than to make Perry wealthy. " You can look at it round or flat, but that real-estate dirt? It 's not sticking, " says Bill Miller. <p> The most lurid gossip about Perry, however, has always revolved around sex. The Internet came alive last August after an Austin gadfly swore he had debriefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor ; no one much believed any of it. By far the most threatening set of rumors Perry has endured all but overwhelmed Austin in early 2004. The stories were remarkably widespread and remarkably specific : Perry 's wife, it was said, was divorcing him after discovering Perry in bed with an aide, an openly gay man. <p> " Everyone in Austin believed it ; I swear, people were watching for moving vans to pull up outside the governor 's mansion, " recalls Jason Stanford, a Democratic consultant who is writing a book about Perry. The stories climaxed on February 24, when a gay-rights group picketed the mansion carrying signs with such slogans as it 's okay to be gay, guv. At a Democratic gathering in Houston, the then chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, Charles Soechting, publicly called attention to the rumors : " For those of you that know, there 's a lot of stuff happening at the state capitol. And you 're going to be excited when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could tell you more, but I think if you 've got someone sitting next to you who knows what 's going on, just get them to whisper it to you. " <p> Forced to confront the rumors, Perry and his wife gave an unprecedented interview to the Austin American-Statesman in which they swore their love and bitterly criticized the rumor--mongers. For the most part the story died then and there. " People say they saw Rick Perry and his aide going to parties together, " says Jason Stanford. " Well, shit, I 've gone to parties with my gay friends and I 'm not gay. Good God. Yet every gay guy in Austin knew someone, always a friend of a friend, who definitely slept with the governor. At one party, I had one gay guy swear Perry was a top and one gay guy swear he was a bottom. It was just bullshit. Look, this is still basically a small town. It would be very hard to conceal an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be out in public with the guy. I mean, come on. " <p> So little did many Texas journalists think of Perry that it took years for them to realize how thoroughly he had consolidated power. Until Perry, Texas was known as a " weak governor " state, meaning the governor has little control over state agencies such as Transportation and Agriculture. " Texas agencies are all run by boards and commissions, all appointed, " says Paul Burka. " Even our two strongest modern governors, John Connally and George W. Bush, appointed people and told them, ' Just go do your job and stay out of the papers. ' That 's what Bush told people. Until Perry, the governor never ran the agencies. The governor was not considered a chief executive officer. What Perry did was he told people if you wanted to be on a board he would appoint you, but only on the grounds that you had to do what he told you to. Perry determined policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <h> Quid Pro Quota <p> D emanding that kind of loyalty has not only given Perry unprecedented control over every lever of Texas power, it has transformed the state government into something like a true political machine -- every ounce of it arming Perry with jobs and money. According to Texans for Public Justice, 921 of Perry 's appointees to government posts donated money to his campaigns or had their spouses do so, amounting to more than $17 million, a whopping 21 percent of all the money he raised while governor. On the rare occasion when a board or commission member has stepped out of line, as with a Texas Tech University regent who supported Perry 's opponent in the 2010 governor 's race, he or she is " allowed ' ' to resign. <p> " Perry 's guys are tough. They play real hardball, ' ' says a Dallas businessman who has given generously to Perry 's campaigns. " Tell you what they did to me : In the last election, I got pressured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a favor. So one of Perry 's top guys is playing golf with my son, who 's active too, and he tells him, ' Your dad gets a pass on the 35K he gave, but we do n't want to see any more of that shit. Or else. ' That 's the kind of game they play, man. ' ' <p> Indeed, under Perry, Austin has undergone an old-style revision to " pay for play ' ' government ; there is a widespread perception that anyone who wants something from government must contribute to Perry. " Early on, in the lobbying business, we were told in no uncertain terms that it did n't matter how Rick feels about you -- if you want time with Rick it 's going to depend on how much your clients give him, ' ' says one Austin lobbyist. " They were absolutely clear about that. ' ' The most commonly cited example of this is the controversy that erupted in 2007 when Perry attempted to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- for sixth-grade girls. The vaccine was made by Merck, whose Austin lobbyist was Perry 's former chief of staff and close friend, Mike Toomey. " Toomey got rich off it. And he 's not the only one, ' ' says another Austin lobbyist. Toomey, in return, started a pac, Make Us Great Again, with a proposed $55 million budget that has so far given more than $5 million to Perry and plans to spend the remainder on him by June. <p> Perry 's critics, in fact, can reel off literally dozens of multi-million-dollar favors the governor has done for his biggest donors : the bill mandating meningitis shots for every college freshman in the state, using a vaccine made by Novartis, which donated $700,000 to the Republican Governors Association, from which Perry( a former chairman) has received $4 million ; Perry 's petitioning of the E.P.A. to waive federal ethanol mandates, a boon to the chicken-farming magnate Lonnie Pilgrim, who has donated $600,000 ; the executive order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 11 of which would be built by the TXU utility( now called Energy Future Holdings), which has given more than $1 million. <p> The list goes on and on. Perry 's chumminess with corporate donors accounts for the staggering $17 million his presidential campaign raised in its first six weeks, the single thing that has kept it afloat ; without that money, he would have had little staying power. But it 's not just money Perry receives in return. As a presidential candidate, he has taken scores of flights on his donors ' private jets. When The New York Times snooped into this, its reporters discovered that Perry 's cash reimbursements for these flights fell a quarter-million dollars short of what was required by law. <p> P erry 's poll numbers were already in single digits on the November night he suffered that epic brain freeze. Overnight he became a national punch line. " What 's the difference between Lindsay Lohan and Rick Perry? ' ' asked Jay Leno. " It only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence. ' ' Jimmy Fallon : " Big news from last night 's Republican debate, you guys. It turns out George Bush was actually the smart Texas governor. ' ' Even Craig Ferguson got his licks in : " Personally, I hope he does n't get out of the campaign. I need Rick Perry. I do n't want to spend the next year trying to do jokes about Mitt Romney. ' ' <p> Immediately after the disastrous debate performance, the campaign went into damage--control overdrive, pushing their candidate into the post-debate " spin room ' ' to joke with reporters. The next night he appeared on Late Night with David Letterman, to read a list of " Top Ten Rick Perry Excuses. ' ' At the same time, the campaign bought nearly $1 million of air time on the Fox News Network. At a foreign-policy debate the following Saturday night, Perry smiled and joked once more about his forgetfulness, drawing appreciative applause from the audience. <p> " Their response to the gaffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Matt Mackowiak, an Austin political consultant. " I thought they actually handled things brilliantly. ' ' The question remains, however : Once a presidential candidate becomes a laughingstock, can he ever truly be taken seriously again? Despite Perry 's good-humored recovery, much of the political community has all but written him off as a dead man walking. " When you become the object of laughter and pity, ' ' says Mark McKinnon, " you 're done. ' ' <p> " The first thing I saw was that Rick Perry came face to face with the fact that running for president is unlike running for anything else in the world, ' ' muses Cragg Hines. " In any other kind of setting, you could have passed this off. But this is beyond white-hot glare. His glibness and irksome spontaneity just failed him. The catch-up was better than the screwup, I have to say. You saw some structure, the Letterman appearance, all that. You know, he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put him out there without a script? It 's pretty rough. Is he not the sharpest knife in the drawer? After all this, how can you not think that? ' ' <p> Others, pointing to the volatility of the G.O.P. field, still refuse to count Perry out. " There are so many times candidates have been pronounced as dead in this race, ' ' says Mackowiak. " Newt Gingrich was dead last spring. Look at him now. At one point Rush Limbaugh said Mitt Romney was dead. All the old rules are out the window this year. Herman Cain went through all this **26;5069;TOOLONG stuff and he stayed in first place in Iowa. It 's been the most volatile Republican field in my lifetime. Conservatives still have n't united behind one candidate, and there 's really only three candidates who can become the anti-Romney : Cain, Newt, and Perry. And Perry, even after all this, has the fewest weaknesses and the most money. ' ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long shot, however. His supporters point out that Romney 's national poll numbers have rarely risen above 26 percent, meaning 74 percent of Republican voters may vote for someone else. And Cain 's numbers have remained strangely high, but no one seriously believes they can endure with all the background noise of sexual harassment. Worse, Cain, unlike Perry, has almost no actual organization to get out the vote in any primary state. If Cain evaporates, and it 's widely assumed he eventually will, his supporters have to go somewhere. <p> His partisans argue that Perry has as good a shot at securing Cain supporters and other conservatives as anyone at this point. His best chance at winning the nomination, most agree, is to somehow clear the table of the " minor ' ' conservative candidates and force Romney into a one-on-one contest, even though it 's far from clear Perry could best him. The math is daunting. Of the three early-primary states, it 's assumed that Perry will surrender New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means Perry needs a win, or at least a strong showing, in South Carolina and especially in the very first contest next month, in Iowa, where Romney is weak. Already Perry is pouring money into television commercials there. The state has a large evangelical population, and Perry, as a former agriculture commissioner in Texas, " knows how to speak the language, ' ' as one Austin consultant puts it. <p> " I s he dead? ' ' asks Hines. " I think he is. But voters have such a short memory. You know, stranger things have happened. ' ' <p> " I was surprised to see him stumble like he did, ' ' says Kent Caperton, the Austin Democrat. " I 've never seen him stumble like that in a performance that was so important. Having said that, as remarkable as the stumble was, just as remarkable was the way he handled it. That says a lot about his resiliency. I still would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the imagination believe he is dead. I think Herman Cain will fade. If he does, it 'll be a Rick Perry -- Mitt Romney contest. I honestly believe that. And Mitt should not underestimate Rick. That 's when Rick is
