The Year of the Flood is a dystopic masterpiece and a testament to her visionary power. <p> The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God 's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God 's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. <p> Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating : the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They ca n't stay locked away... <p> By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, The Year of the Flood is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive. <p> Margaret Atwood on The Year of the Flood <p> I 've never before gone back to a novel and written another novel related to it. Why this time? Partly because so many people asked me what happened right after the end of the 2003 novel, Oryx and Crake. I did n't actually know, but the questions made me think about it. That was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to preoccupy me. <p> When Oryx and Crake came out, it seemed to many like science fiction--way out there, too weird to be possible--but in the three years that passed before I began writing The Year of the Flood, the perceived gap between that supposedly unreal future and the harsh one we might very well live through was narrowing fast. What is happening to our world? What can we do to reverse the damage? How long have we got? And, most importantly--what kind of " we "? In other words, what kind of people might undertake the challenge? Dedicated ones--they 'd have to be. And unless you believe our planet is worth saving, why bother? <p> So the question of inspirational belief entered the picture, and once you have a set of beliefs--as distinct from a body of measurable knowledge--you have a religion. The God 's Gardeners appear briefly in Oryx and Crake, but in The Year of the Flood, they 're central. Like all religions, the Gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their own honoured saints and martyrs, their special days, their theology. They may look strange and obsessive and even foolish to non-members, but they 're serious about what they profess ; as are their predecessors, who are with us today. I 've found out a great deal about rooftop gardens and urban beekeeping while writing this book! <p> Another question frequently asked about Oryx and Crake concerned gender. Why was the story told by a man? How would it have been different if the narrator had been a woman? Such questions led me to Ren and Toby, and then to their respective lives, and also to their places of refuge. A high-end sex club and a luxury spa would in fact be quite good locations in which to wait out a pandemic plague : at least you 'd have bar snacks, and a lot of clean towels. <p> In his book, The Art Instinct, Denis Dutton proposes that our interest in narrative is built in--selected during the very long period the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell stories about both past and future would have an evolutionary edge. Will there be a crocodile in the river tomorrow, as there was last year? If so, better not go there. Speculative fictions about the future, like The Year of the Flood, are narratives of that kind. Where will the crocodiles be? How will we avoid them? What are our chances? --Margaret Atwood <h> More About the Author <p> MARGARET ATWOOD, whose work has been published in over thirty-five countries, is the author of more than forty books of fiction, poetry, and critical essays. In addition to The Handmaid 's Tale, her novels include Cat 's Eye, shortlisted for the Booker Prize ; Alias Grace, which won the Giller Prize in Canada and the Premio Mondello in Italy ; The Blind Assassin, winner of the 2000 Booker Prize ; and her most recent, Oryx and Crake, shortlisted for the 2003 Booker Prize. She lives in Toronto with writer Graeme Gibson. <p> I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing, I find they influence my thinking forever after. Say what you will--her nightmares are not easy to dismiss! <p> Readers of 2003 's Oryx and Crake will recognize the world of The Year of the Flood. Neither a prequel nor a sequel, the latter is more of a companion novel. It 's set in the same world, covering roughly the same time span. Whereas Oryx and Crake was a post-apocalyptic narrative told from Jimmy 's point of view, here the narrators are Toby and Ren. Jimmy, Oryx, and Crake make appearances in this novel, and readers of both books will discovered minor characters from the former novel are major characters in the latter. In short, the two are intertwined, but may be read in any order. It is not necessary to have read Oryx and Crake first, though ultimately reading them both is an immensely satisfying experience, shedding light on many aspects of the story being told. <p> Now to the story... Toby and Ren have both spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group called God 's Gardeners. Ren was brought to the ascetic group as a child by her mother. Toby found her way there out of desperation in adulthood. Each has professed disbelief in the tenets of the religion, but the pacifistic and environmental teachings have become deeply ingrained in both. At the opening of the novel, it is Year Twenty-Five in the God 's Gardeners ' calendar ; the Year of the Waterless Flood. <p> From the beginning, the group 's prophet-like leader had preached that a " waterless flood " was coming to wipe out humanity. In addition to their dogmatic environmentalism, the group believed in preparing for this flood with survival skills and food caches called " Ararats. " The predicted day has come in the form of a global pandemic. Society has broken down completely. From their respective places of isolation, each woman wonders if she may be the last human left and struggles to survive in this altered world. <p> As everyone knows, there 's nothing like apocalypse to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ups and downs of her life with the Gardeners and beyond, the reader gradually gleans a fuller picture of the world these women lived in, their individual and joint histories, what led to cataclysm, and what has ultimately happened to the world. <p> As one might expect from Atwood, The Year of the Flood is a beautiful telling of an ugly story. And what a story it is! In addition to being very much a novel of ideas, it is an utterly un-put-downable page-turner! It 's a quick read, with short chapters and lots of white space on the pages. The novel flies by. The ending is satisfying and unsatisfying at once. It sheds some light on Oryx and Crake 's enigmatic conclusion and completes this arc of the story, but leaves this reader very much hoping for a final volume of this rumored trilogy. <p> In Margaret Atwood 's three compelling and quite different visions of an apocalyptic future, some things never change. There are always the powerful corporations intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The Handmaid 's Tale, " which turn prayer into a commodity ; the Secretburger franchises of " The Year of the Flood, " which dispense cheap burgers of dubious provenance. The environment is always degraded, resulting in a precipitous drop in the birth rate( " The Handmaid 's Tale ") and the terrifying daily thunderstorms of " The Year of the Flood. " In all three stories, there is an Orwellian social structure : a tiny elite intent both on holding power at all costs and on a comfortable, even luxurious, life style ; a larger group of terrified, obedient mid-level party/corporate functionaries ; and a vast underclass that lives in squalor and in violence---the " pleeblands " of her newest novel. And, most important to all three dystopias, there are cold, brutal men with the most up to date weapons " who make sure--successfully, until the global pandemics in both " Oryx and Crake " and " The Year of the Flood " nearly destroy the human race-- that everyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thus, it 's quite amazing that her newest dystopia is so different, so inventive, and so convincing, even though elements of " The Year of the Flood " overlap with those in " Oryx and Crake " and the novels are set in parallel, time-wise, with a male protagonist in " Oryx " and two female protagonists, Toby and Ren, in " Flood. " Completely original and central to " Flood " is the made-up religion( complete with made-up hymns) of Gods Gardeners, led by its fatherly chief composter, sermonizer, and philosopher, Adam One. He 's a wonderful pastiche, equally earnest and ridiculous--straight out of the pages of " Mother Earth News. " The characterizations of the rest of the Gardeners, the numbered Adams and Eves, are equally tender, as they tend their bees and mushrooms and the rooftop garden and patiently store away supplies in hidden " Ararats " for the calamity they know is coming. Unlike Orwell 's degraded masses, these proles are full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She can put a plot together better than just about anyone, and the coalescing threads of this one kept me reading until midnight as the world came to an------well, not exactly, and not in the way you might think. Apocalypse, as constructed by Atwood, is never predictable, always astonishing, and certainly not impossible. <p> Margaret Atwood 's latest book The Year of the Flood is another of her dystopian offerings. It 's many years in the future( Atwood never gives an exact date), and humans have finally managed to destroy much in the natural world. Many animal species are extinct, pollution is rampant, weather is out of control, and society is buckling down to live out the days the best they can. Into all this comes the " waterless flood ", a disaster that has wiped out nearly all the humans in the world. At least two have survived : Toby, the manager of a high-end spa who has barricaded herself inside ; and Ren, a dancer/prostitute who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sick bay) when the disaster hit. Now, separately, the two have to try to survive in this strange new unpeopled world. Will they ever find each other? And, the bigger question : did anyone else survive? <p> I really liked this book ; it 's not only a great read but very thought-provoking as well. The story is told with flashbacks to Ren and Toby 's former lives, which added a lot to the book ; it made an interesting contrast to see what things were like before the waterless flood. Toby is tough, smart, and resourceful ; and it 's always wonderful to see a strong female protaganist( one reason I love Atwood 's books). I also thought Atwood did an excellent job of showing how bad things could possibly get on earth in the years to come, without being preachy about it. <p> I did have two minor quibbles about the book, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. The first was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Anooyoo ", " violet biolet ", " SekSmart ", " Mo'hairs ", " Sea/H/Ear candy ", " liobams "( if names will really be this cheesy in the future than the world is indeed in trouble ; -)!. Yes, it 's a very minor thing, but for some reason it grated on my nerves a bit. The other quibble I ca n't say without giving away spoilers, but it has to do with some coincidences that happen towards the end of the book. I did n't find these coincidences to be very plausible. <p> Minor quibbles non-withstanding, I could barely tear myself away from the pages of this book. I highly recommend it, especially if you like your sci-fi with a mix of great literature. <p> The Year of the Flood is a follow-up to Oryx &; Crake, following God 's Gardeners before and through the catastrophes of O &C.; It looks like there will be a third as well ; new editions of O &C,; at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book of the " MaddAdam Trilogy. " <p> I did choose to do this, and I was thankful I did.
