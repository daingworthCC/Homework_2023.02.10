5256141 <p> The State Attorney 's Office prosecuting the case against George Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, mistakenly released a trove of evidence on Thursday that included a grainy photo of Martin 's body and Zimmerman 's college transcript. <p> Not long after Special Prosecutor Angela Corey 's office sent an email to media outlets with the evidence attached, the office issued a statement asking reporters to " please disregard and do not use the information contained in the initial e-mail. It was inadvertently attached. " <p> The Huffington Post will not be publishing the evidence that was released in full. It did not reveal any bombshells in the case, which has been closely watched for months as the State Attorney 's office has incrementally released information. <p> But among the more superficially interesting details gleaned from the leaked evidence came from Zimmerman 's academic record. While Zimmerman, by his own account, longed to have a career in law enforcement, and to follow in his former magistrate father 's footsteps, he earned a D in " Intro To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Violent Predators " during his time at Seminole State college in Central Florida. <p> He also failed algebra twice, according to the documents. <p> Zimmerman was a student at the college on Feb. 26, 2012, when he shot and killed Martin, but he was expelled shortly thereafter due to safety concerns and the high profile nature of his case. <p> Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, and is currently free on $1 million bond. <p> CORRECTION : A previous version of this article referred to George Zimmerman 's father, Robert, as a " magistrate judge, " which is imprecise. Robert Zimmerman was a magistrate in Virginia, a position that is distinct from that of judge in that state. <p> Loading Slideshow <p> A photograph of George Zimmerman taken the night he shot and killed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, FL. <p> The gun George Zimmerman used to shoot Trayvon Martin can be seen in this evidence photo. <p> George Zimmerman 's gun and clip can be seen in this evidence photograph taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altercation with the unarmed teen, who was returning to the house where his father was staying on February 26 after a trip to a nearby 7-Eleven. <p> George Zimmerman photographed by police the night he shot and killed Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford, FL. <p> Cuts can be seen on the face of George Zimmerman in this photo taken by police on the night he shot and killed Trayvon Martin.

A lot has to be proven to make that charge stick. The prosecution should have gone for murder 2 or even man slaughter. Man 1 or 2 may have been a slam dunk conviction. <p> It 's also disturbing the way the judge allowed this to go " prime time ". <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> This case seems far more straightforward than greedy lawyers and biased faily members make out ; a neighbourhood watch volunteer is spooked by a stranger and shoots him believing he was being attacked.

Why do TM 's parents need a lawyer does n't the state pay to prosecute? I mean the first thing the lawyer did was seal the kids school records............ so they force feed you that he was a good kid right? Now the pot smoking thief that assaulted people that is the truth....... is that right? The stupidest people on here are the ones who try to make him a poor innocent child. Now how does that go? ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes you ca n't make a punk into a hero.......... so buy your shirts in support the facts are the facts. GZ is an innocent man??? How do I know you ask?? wellllllllllllllllllll lets see ok got it **27;268;TOOLONG self defense is not a crime.So try and find someone better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctify them.You missed your mark with this kid. <p> Victims of violent crime such as Mr. Zimmerman have suffered trauma and may not remember all the facts until they can process in their minds what just happened. I have no doubt he was defending himself against an attack. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> For one thing they need a lawyer to sue their son 's murderer. And I suspect they will succeed in that. Travon 's charactor should not be an issue here. His charactor was not known to GZ when GZ targeted him. Look at the facts : GZ packed a pistol and hit the streets. GZ profiled Trayvon as a criminal suspect with nothing more than they way Trayvon looked as justification. GZ tried to gather support for his anticipated actions by calling 911 but was advised not to confront Trayvon. GZ then lamented that these people always " get away ". GZ continued to stalk Trayvon and eventually confronted him. GZ shot the unarmed Trayvon and lied about how it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what is " not a crime ". Shooting an unarmed man who you had no reason to confront in the first place is murder. You do n't anticipate, create, provoke, confront, escalate and then have the gall to claim self defence. <p> He asked him a question... GOT IT???? What are you up to.... thats all.The kid did n't like that white guy asking him a question.A QUESTION and he came back to attack him.Since when do you have the right to use violence when you do n't like that someone asked you A QUESTION????? He did not stalk him at all and the confrontation was A QUESTION... do you get it yet?? This kid was a weed smoker and seller, a thief and he attacked GZ much like he did the bus driver 2 days before, because he would n't let him ride for free. The parents hired a lawyer to seal the kid 's school records so they can have fools like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be further from the truth. i know I just wasted my time saying all this to you, but it may cause some to look at the facts and not some sugar coated version........... By the way it is spelled defense. You really Bore Me!!! <h> Loading comments... <p> well, I am sure if GZ was in colorado he would not do the right thing as events in florida showed that he did some mistakes in the shooting and after the shooting. So these events clearly shows that he does n't have the qualifications to be a hero. A hero would n't try to fool the court and try to get advantage of a situation. Believe me, a hero is a hero in all events. It is not something they can be in one place and kill teens in other places because they look suspecious. My wish that he would be in colorado shooting was as a way to make him die as a victim because perhaps some of the victims who actually died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy who could have avoided ending a teen 's life one way or another. I admit that I am mad at GZ, I ca n't accept the fact, that his shooting could have been avoided by at least shooting the kid in his leg or any place where he could still live. <p> 1. Going on Fox News and stating that killing Martin was an act of God. 2. Changing lie from Martin chasing him to Martin was " SKIPPING ". 3. Instrumental in getting his wife jailed and charged with a Felony. 4. Trying to shake down Ms. Barbara Walters. 5. Detaining two seven year old black boys and calling 911 because he deemed " Suspicious ". 6. Making negative and racist statements on his my space page about his own people. 7. Assault on a police officer. 8. Assaulted his ex girlfriend. 9. Molested his cousin for over 10 years. 10. Used the race card to incite public support and be rewarded for killing Martin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, nor do I ever want to. It is very obvious that you and the rest of his supporters are down with the lie and race card game is playing. On the for real side, I do not think you really believe this dude. You are pissed that this black kid got so much attention by people of all types of creeds, class and color. <p> To you it does not matter that Martin was murdered, because you believe the ends justify the means and another black male has been eliminated. <h> Loading comments... <p> Evidence " accidentally " released?

Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior. <p> If your doctor has told you to take temazepam regularly, talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking temazepam, you may feel depressed or have more difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or you may experience more severe withdrawal symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, stomach and muscle cramp s, vomiting, sweating, and rarely, seizures. <p> Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer 's patient information sheet( Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with temazepam and each time you refill your prescription.

" <p> There is absolutely nothing to indicate that the young man violently attacked and assaulted by Martin was every addicted to any of the legally prescribed medications that he used. There is absolutely no reason to suspect that he did n't know all the needed information about any of his prescriptions. I wonder how severly Martin was addicted to the drugs he used. I wonder if he understood all possible side effects of them - I doubt his dealer every explained them to him. <p> Are you arare that the level of THC in his system showed Martin had not smoked for days?
