5085341 <p> I would too, just as I would for any other girl I might come in sexual contact with, prostitute or not. Because there are a lot of people who sleep around, the only difference is they do n't get paid to sleep around. So unless money is what transmits the diseases I would have anyone checked out following that logic. <p> Provided they gave it up and got tested. I see no reason to judge them for that. They may be a little damaged, but time and therapy heals many wounds. All that matters is who they 've become in the face of their adversities. <p> I am a woman, and if I were a man I would never be with a woman that would defile her body in such a way!!! A man must not think much of himself to even be wiht someone like that... that is a disgrace!!! <p> No need to put yourself in out position. You do know that there are male prostitutes also, right? Actually I think a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor, and a respectable person. <p> Do n't act like you 've NEVER judged anybody in your life, Mr. or Ms. Righteous. Judgement is survival mechanism. You just judged our society even though you 're a part of it. <p> These comments are based on the typical prostitute. I never judged anybody. I merely stated the most obvious reasons( other than forced labor) that women become prostitutes. For the record, prostitution is dehumanizing only when the woman is a sex slave. However, most Western prostitutes do it by choice not force. There are several reasons women become whores worldwide. <p> Some do it to escape poverty( often leading to becoming a sex slave), some do it because of the great life it can provide when under the a good " manager "( i.e. porn starlets or professional escorts), but some do it because they 're too lazy to do anything else( street walkers)... At any rate, theses women are missing something emotionally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases. <p> This is why they are not fit for committed relationships. If they were, they would have chosen to be in one. Being a prostitute is easy for theme because of their unattached nature. I did n't say that to be inhumane. I said that because it 's the truth! <p> ' ' Do n't act like you 've NEVER judged anybody in your life, Mr. or Ms. Righteous. Judgement is survival mechanism.

Most, according to that same study, would love to get the Hell out from prostitution. Extremely large rape-rates, drug addiction, etc. Street walkers, not for laziness, but yes for dead-ends. And last time I checked, Portugal was in the West. <p> ' ' This is why they are not fit for committed relationships.

Ca n't someone be out of an relationship? 2) Actually, as it happens, many former porn stars have family, tarted by themselves. And many prostitutes leave that job, and years later, their life is changed. Again, you applied a generalization, and generalizations rarely are true, if in any occasion. <p> Thank you :) I thought I would be crucified here by stating the obvious just because it 's a racial thing and most people care for it, but when we speak about prostitutes
