The Giants are 25th in the league, surrendering 382.3 yards per game. They are 26th in the league against the pass, and have surrendered 45 pass plays of 20 yards or more. Only the New England Patriots( 48) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers( 46) have given up more big plays. <p> Still, though, tweaking the defending Super Bowl champions might not be a smart move -- especially since Green 's Bengals are 3-5 and have lost four straight. <p> Green, however, believes that if the Bengals can get the Giants ' pass rush contained they have an opportunity to make plays. <p> " We just have to be solid up front and then we 'll see what happens, " Green said. <p> Green has 51 catches this season for 735 yards and eight touchdowns. It will be interesting to see how the Giants try to handle @ @
