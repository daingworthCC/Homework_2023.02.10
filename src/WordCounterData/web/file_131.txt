5039641 <p> Hello! Thanks so much for checking out my project. The idea is very simple. As a designer, I love creating logos. So, I thought it would be fun, and challenging, to do a project with the straightforward concept of creating a whole bunch of different logos for a whole bunch of different people, based on each person 's name. That 's it. Each backer will have a unique, custom and professionally designed logo created for them that represents their own name. Then, all of the logos will be displayed at namelogodirectory.com. Why a directory? Because each logo will then link to a specific URL that the backer gets to choose... It could be their own Facebook page, Twitter, website, etc.( nothing obscene or inappropriate though). Depending on the number of backers, this project could be pretty huge. But in then end, I think it would be such a cool design piece to see hundreds of individual name logos displayed on the site together. Check out the examples images below, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> About The Logos <p> As a design nerd, I 'm pretty picky about consistency. So, to give the final site a consistent look, I 'm planning for each logo to be displayed in black and white. Also, in the event that this project actually takes off and receives a lot of backers, I want to let everyone know in advance that the number of hours spent on each individual logo may be limited to an hour or two. Just imagine if for some crazy reason there were 500 people who backed this project, it could then potentially take 4 months, working 40 hours per week to finish all of the logos... Which would be awesome!!... But pretty challenging at the same time. However, I think that 's where the really interesting part of this project might come into play... Designing consistently good logos in a limited amount of time probably wo n't be easy, but I 'm excited to push my inspiration and creativity to new limits. No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refuse to put out anything that looks bad with my name attached to it. <p> About The Funding <p> Overall, you can think of it this way ; Backers get a unique, custom designed logo, while I get a really sweet design project. Upon successful funding, I 'll reach out to each backer and ask that they submit a brief sentence or two about themselves from which I may draw inspiration for their logo design. <p> The reason I 'd like to raise at least $500 is so that there could potentially be at least 20 backers at the lowest funding level... Otherwise, I 'm afraid that namelogodirectory.com might feel a little empty in the end, and it 's potential impact would be lost. <p> Thank You <p> If you want to learn more about me and my design skills, please visit brandoneck.com. Again, big thanks for taking the time to read this. I 'm excited to see what we can do! <h> FAQ <p> Yes, backers will fully own their logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to with it... This includes everything from getting it trademarked to even having it updated or edited by another designer if they should ever choose to do so. After the logo is designed, I 'll send backers a copy of the original design file, and also a copy of the file in a format that they can easily work with( PDF, JPG, PNG, etc.). <p> I really went back and forth a lot with the idea of doing logos for companies/products as a part of this project before it launched, but in the end, I 've decided to stick with just name logos for now. However, I 'm planning to do a company/product logo project similar to this one next if this ends up being a success. <h> Pledge $25 or more <p> 173 backers <p> You 'll receive your very own unique, custom designed black and white name logo( I 'll send you the actual file in your preferred format, EPS, AI, PSD, PDF, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at namelogodirectory.com and will link to the URL of your choice. <h> Pledge $50 or more <p> 27 backers <p> You 'll receive your very own unique, custom designed black and white name logo + Your logo will be displayed and highlighted at namelogodirectory.com where it will link to the URL of your choice + One color version of your logo( we can discuss your color preferences). <h> Pledge $150 or more <p> 5 backers <p> Super Customization!! I will present you with three different name logo designs from which you may choose.
