5048841 <h> Breaking Bracelets With Zayn <p> Harry eyed the boy who was sitting beside him, a smirk playing on his lips. " Why are you wearing the sex bracelets? " <p> Four pairs of eyes directed their attentions to the curly-haired boy, looking really tired. They had just finished an early morning interview and they were in their van, on their way back to the hotel. <p> " The bracelets, " Harry said and flicked the bracelets with his fingers. <p> " You mean, the jelly bracelets, " Zayn chuckled. <p> " Yeah, also known as sex bracelets, " Harry moved his hands actively in front of him as he explained. <p> " I 've no idea what you 're talking about, " Zayn shrugged and turned his head to the side to look at the scenery through the window. <p> " I 've heard of them, " Louis grinned. " It 's like you have to do something according to the colour that you 're wearing, right? " <p> " Yeah, kind of, " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like if someone breaks one of Zayn 's bracelets, Zayn will have to let that person do what he or she wants according to what the colour says, to him. " <p> " Ooh... sounds fun, " Louis said, eyeing Zayn 's hand as well. " I 've to get some for El. " <p> " They 're just bracelets, " Zayn stated and elbowed Harry in the ribs, " I do n't believe you anyway. " <p> " But that 's how it works, " Harry bit his upper lip and sent a smirk Zayn 's way. <p> " There 's everything but sex about jelly bracelets, " Zayn laughed along with Liam and Niall. <p> " I can show you. " Harry poked his tongue at his three friends and pulled his blackberry from his pocket, instantly opening a browser and connecting to Google. Typing ' Jelly Bracelets Meaning ' in the search bar, Harry waited for the page to load before handing Zayn the phone. " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I mean, if you want to have sex with someone, you can just go do it anytime. You do n't need bracelets or any other things, " Liam rolled his eyes and sent another text message to his mom. <p> " No, you guys are stupid, " Harry sulked and turned to look outside. " And you 're no fun. " <p> " These are some nice colours you have here, " Harry bit his lips and eyed the colourful bracelets again ; there were a dozen, two of each colour. <p> " Yellow means... " Harry reached forward to pluck one of the bracelets but Zayn pulled his hand out of Harry 's reach. <p> " I do n't wan na know what it means, " Zayn shook his head negatively and hid his hand behind his back. " I do n't wan na play sex games with you. " <p> Harry pouted and crossed his hands on his knees before laying his head on them. Those bracelets were intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find it hot if one of his friends wore it, the curly head found it somewhat attractive. Taking a deep breath, Harry closed his eyes and thought to himself ; by hook or by crook, he wanted to snap at least one of them. <p> " Looks like someone wants to screw his best friend but does n't know how to. And now, using the excuse of the sex bracelet, he ' gon na get his way, " Liam tried not to laughed at his statement. <p> " Lea'me alone, " Harry groaned, his voiced muffled in his hands. <p> " Hey curly, what 's yellow? " Louis asked, shaking Harry 's shoulder. <p> " Nuh-huh, I 'm not telling anyone, " Harry laughed as he sat up straight again, wriggling his eyebrows. " It 's more fun when the wearer does n't know what 's waiting for him. " <p> Zayn rolled his eyes and twirled his fingers around Harry 's curls. " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " We 'll see, " Harry smirked. <p> " And I thought you were into Larry Stylinson, " Liam raised his knuckle near his mouth and giggled. " But you 're going all Zarry here. " <p> " What? " Harry coughed, almost spitting his water, before capping the bottle. <p> " I ca n't believe you just said that, " Niall said through a mouthful of doughnut. " He 's your friend, best friend, bandmate. " <p> " Why is everyone getting me wrong? I was just saying, " Harry shrugged. <p> " It 's the effect of the sex bracelets, " Louis laughed. <p> " Leave him alone, " Zayn shook his head and wrapped his arm around Harry 's shoulder. <p> " Thank you. " Harry tilted his head to the side and smiled at Zayn, glancing at the hand that was around his shoulder. After making sure that Zayn was not paying attention, Harry raised his hand and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one. " Oops. " <p> " Why did you do that? " Zayn asked and slapped the back of Harry 's head. <p> " What does he have to do? " Louis asked excitedly. <p> " Nothing, I do n't have to do anything, " Zayn sighed and retrieved his hand from around the younger boy. " Why did you do that? " <p> " I 'm not doing anything sexual with you, " Zayn stated and crossed his arms over his chest. <p> " Who said anything about sex? Yellow is just a hug, " Harry grinned and pulled off his best puppy face ; the one that no one can ever resist. " Wo n't you hug me? " <p> " Fine but no more, " Zayn warned. <p> " No more, " Harry said with a huge grin and crossed his fingers behind his back. <p> Zayn nodded and pulled Harry into a tight hug. That was nothing new ; Harry always got homesick and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay. However that one was nothing like I'm-missing-home kind of hug, resulting in Zayn quickly pulling away when he felt the younger boy 's fingers rubbing the skin at the back of his neck. He glared at Harry who smiled sheepishly as though nothing happened and shook his head ; Harry could be so unpredictable sometimes. Zayn sighed happily when the van came to a halt and Paul ushered them out of the vehicle, handing them each a marker. <p> " There are a few girls waiting ; sign a few stuffs and take some pictures but be quick, " Paul instructed and they were joined by a group of security. " Make sure to be extra careful, you know how crazy the fans get. " <p> The boys made their way to the huge crowd of screaming girls who were waiting outside, in the cold, just to get a glimpse of the boys. Niall took the lead as they made their way to the girls and chatted with them, stopping for a few snaps before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five boys walked to the elevator, closely followed by Paul. <p> " Just making sure you get to your rooms safely, " Paul stated and nodded with a grin. <p> " Hope you did n't get any of your bracelets broken by the fans, " Harry whispered into Zayn 's ear. " That would be a waste. " <p> " They 're fine, " Zayn kicked Harry 's arm and let out a laugh. " Do n't
