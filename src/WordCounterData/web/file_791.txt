5106341 <p> China 's demand has faltered with the slowing economy, pushing steel prices to a three-year low and making it tough for mills and traders to keep up with payments on the $400 billion of debt they racked up during years of double-digit growth. <p> As defaults have risen in the world 's largest steel consumer, lenders have found that warehouse receipts for metal pledged as collateral do not always lead them to stacks of stored metal. Chinese authorities are investigating a number of cases in which steel documented in receipts was either not there, belonged to another company or had been pledged as collateral to multiple lenders, industry sources said. <p> Ghost inventories are exacerbating the wider ailments of the sector in China, which produces around 45 percent of the world 's steel and has over 200 million metric tons( 220.5 million tons) of excess production capacity. Steel is another drag on a financial system struggling with bad loans from the property sector and local governments. <p> " What we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg, " said a trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media. " The situation will get worse as poor demand, slumping prices and tight credit from banks create a domino effect on the industry. " <p> Four decades ago, when we were lending money to steel companies, the US produced around 130 million tons of steel and China produced 25 million tons. Today, the US produces 80 million tons or so and China apparently produces over 700 million tons. Amazing overcapacity. <p> Since 2009, China 's banks flooded the country with over $5 trillion in loans to pump up the economy in the face of flagging exports. Many empty cities were built. Now the lenders are finding out that the warehouses holding their collateral were empty too. <h> 3 Responses to " The Producers..... of steel in this case " <p> 700 million tons? Are they actually importing enough ore to cover that production? Or are brand-new shapes being recycled just to keep the mills busy? Or are they simply lying about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported by China. It is the Chinese government that collects, summarizes, and massages those figures, just as the US government does for its own statistics. <p> In the US, there are independent voices to question and explain government statistics. Remember that the US government report/website of jobs created and saved cost $18 million. It reported 100,000 new jobs within congressional districts that do not exist. <p> If China actually has explosive economic growth, it would be the first time that a totalitarian government has not lied about its growth figures. <p> The( now reorganized) Soviet Union reported explosive growth right up to the point that their economy collapsed, and their empire mostly dissolved. <p> The US government will report hopeful improvement and massive spending to " rebuild the economy " right
