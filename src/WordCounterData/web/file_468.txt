5073641 <h> Q &A:; Andre Berto <p> By Jeff Reiners Photo : Gene Blevins -- Hoganphotos/Golden Boy <p> Two-Time Welterweight World Champion Andre Berto( 28-1, 22 KOs) is eager to mix it up as he concludes preparation for his first bout in 14 months. Berto faces Four-Division titlist Robert Guerrero 's( 30-1-1, 18 KOs) Saturday night on HBO. At stake is Guerrero 's WBC Interim Welterweight World Championship. <p> After a workout at the Westside Boxing Club in Los Angles, Berto spoke to Fightnews.com about his signature punch, his NFL look-a-like and Emanuel Steward. <p> Everything going as planned in Los Angeles? <p> Yeah, yeah everything 's good. <p> Looking back a couple fights, a lot of boxing types will talk about how a war like the Ortiz fight will take something physically from a fighter. How do you recover and bounce back from a fight like that? <p> A fight like that was a dog fight. I just took a lot of rest, a lot of time off. You could see that it did n't affect me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in there and grabbed another title. I 've had a lot of time since the Ortiz fight so definitely had enough time to rest up. <p> Having watched you for several years now I notice the right uppercut every time I see you fight. Is the right uppercut a special punch for you and how will you use it against a southpaw? <p> That 's a punch I 've always loved. I was a Mike Tyson fan growing up. In the pro 's you do n't see many people trying to execute it as much. It 's a punch I always loved as a young amateur and brought it to the pros. It 's almost become my staple punch. It 's going to be a good punch to use against a southpaw as well. <p> Regarding Guerrero, given that he 's moving up to welterweight, where you 're solid and that he 's a former featherweight champion, how much of an advantage is that going to be or will it even matter Saturday? <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He 's had a fight at 147, he fought a tough guy from Turkey( Selcuk Aydin). Guerrero does n't fight like me at all, but I think he 's had plenty of time to settle in at 147. <p> I get that a lot man, it 's just basically the fast hands and fast combination punching.( Taylor) was always one of my favorite fighters growing up as well. So you know, it 's a fair comparison. <p> I read a piece that you wrote for the New York Times a few years back where you wrote people always mistake you for Reggie Bush. When 's the last time that happened? <p>( Laughter) You know what, it was recently man. Probably like a month ago I was down in Miami and people swore I was him. I had to tell them sorry.( Laughter) That 's my man though, he 's a good guy. <p> I understand you sparred at Kronk before the 2004 Olympics, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time up in Detroit with Emanuel. I 've known Emanuel for years. He 's a good friend of mine. Ever since I heard the news I just could n't believe. I definitely reach out and extend my blessings to the family. This fight is going to be dedicated to Emanuel and his family. <p> Did Emanuel Steward have any special impact on your career? <p> Manny used to always call me " Mr. Excitement " or " Mr. Explosive. " He watched me in the amateurs. He saw me fight some classic amateur fights and I brought that style to the pros. Emanuel always called me that since the amateurs, saying I 'm " Mr. Excitement " and " Mr. Explosive
