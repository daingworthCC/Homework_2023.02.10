5252041 <h> Their View : Either side would have tough four years ahead <p> I drafted this column before the polls closed, not knowing how things would play out Tuesday ; but naturally I ca n't resist updating it to acknowledge how things played out. <p> What I saw most clearly, thinking Tuesday morning about the future, was that whichever party won the presidency should n't get comfortable. The U.S. still faces some very real problems, some of which may not have widely acceptable solutions. <p> Our economy has not fully recovered, the deficit remains dangerously high, and we 're rapidly approaching a deficit-related " cliff. " Longer-term problems include : past inattention to education and infrastructure ; the aging of our population combined with rising health-care costs ; climate change ; energy costs and dependence on foreign oil ; and the fact that we spend vast sums to protect military bases and interests around the globe. <p> If Republicans won, they 'd lose in 2016. <p> The party has moved too far to the right to stay relevant in the 21st Century. That point was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly, as networks intercut between the largely young and ethnically varied supporters waiting for Obama and the older, mostly white group supporting Romney. <p> A Romney victory would have given us several more far-right U.S. Supreme Court justices. With their help, President Romney could have delighted the Tea Party and angered many women by making abortions illegal, and could pursue the fight against gay marriage, which is <p> Advertisement <p> laughable to the young and loses support among older folks every year. Election Night illustrated this too : in two states, voters for the first time voted their approval of gay marriage, while two other states voted to legalize recreational marijuana. <p> Romney 's economic promises were wholly inconsistent with each other. Four years would have revealed that unmistakably to the voters who believed in 2012 that maybe he could work magic ; and after four years President Romney could no longer blame Obama for not getting us out of the Bush recession fast enough. <p> Meanwhile, just as Hurricane Sandy pushed climate change back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make Republican denials sound even hollower. <p> Republican extremists, emboldened by success, would have pushed Romney to extremes unpalatable to the rest of us -- forgetting that Romney narrowed the 2012 race only by denying at the last minute everything he 'd said for two years. No etch-a-sketch would have been big enough to wipe four full years from the collective memory. <p> But the Democrats also have reason to worry about 2016. <p> Four short years after Bush left office, as we 're still struggling to dig our way out of the mess, the Republicans nearly won. They nearly won with a candidate whom even Republicans could n't make themselves like, advocating the policies that helped create our financial problems. Fair or unfair, by 2016 Democrats will own those problems in the public mind. <p> This was also the first presidential election since the Supreme Court 's ruling in Citizens United. Nationally and locally, PACs used abundant, untraceable funds to say increasingly outrageous things without fear of liability. The 2016 elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's creativity. <p> Republicans, controlling many state governments, will continue their carefully planned effort to restrict voting among the folks most likely to vote Democratic. Fewer early-voting opportunities, more photo-I.D. requirements, and other " minor reforms " will subtract from the Democratic vote totals in 2016. <p> On the national level, Tea Party Republicans( and party leaders who fear them) greeted Obama 's initial election by deciding that destroying him was more important than doing the best they could for the country. Will they greet his re-election as a warning to work with him toward solving problems? One hopes so ; and one hopes that if they continue their obstreperous course their constituents will see them for what they are ; but it 's more likely that Republican House members will automatically call the sky red if Obama says it 's blue, and then try to blame him for not getting a consensus on the sky 's color. <p> Republicans will again play " chicken " with the nation 's economy the way teenagers do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to avoid disaster -- or that if he does n't the public wo n't be able to see whose fault the disaster is. <p> Civility and compromise are at a pretty low ebb in the political world. That 's partly because of the Republican flight to the right, but also because we live in a time when every political sneeze is analyzed ad nauseum in cyberspace, and on talk radio and TV, before anyone can say " God Bless You. " Gridlock will leave voters even more disgusted with both parties in 2016 than it did this year. <p> I did n't have to know who won Tuesday to know that politicians in both parties need to relearn some manners, and be more flexible and creative in seeking practical solutions to very serious problems. <p> Part of that change needs to start with each of us. As I wrote Tuesday morning : " Wrongheaded as some of us will think he is, the next president is neither a traitor nor a devil. At some level he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his view of the country may differ sharply from ours. We owe him frank but fair criticism and more respect publically than some of us will think he deserves. " <p> " Could you do that? " someone asked. Had Romney won, I 'd have tried. <p> Peter Goodman and his wife Dael live
