5252241 <p> I am schizophrenic, can we look at the possibility that reincarnation is the reason i am hearing voices? Perhaps we do n't know everything about the process of reincarnation. I have only come up with : maybe we have some connection to our past lives because we leave something behind in every universe or if theres only one universe in this universe and from every life we live. You might need to know about reincarnation to answer this the way i want you to. <p> i have also wondered if parallel universes overlapping( if they can do that) is the cause for my illness. Tell me why parallel universes can not do that. Tell me why theres no possibility of me being connected to another universe causing confusion in my brain. <p> I want to go beyond the thought ' If i hear voices then they must be gods ". <p> thank you. I think because of the parallel universe question this applies to science. or that this is a science question in a way. <p> I am schizophrenic, can we look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices?

Just answer the questions. i do nt even know what a troll is. <p> The ' Parallel Universe Theory ' once advanced by Stephen Hawking has since been retracted by him. <p> Previously, Hawking, 62, had held out the possibility that disappearing matter travels through the black hole to a new parallel universe -- the very stuff of most visionary science fiction. <p> " There is no baby universe branching off, as I once thought. The information remains firmly in our universe, " Hawking said in a speech to the conference. <p> " I 'm sorry to disappoint science fiction fans, but if information is preserved, there is no possibility of using black holes to travel to other universes, " he said. " If you jump into a black hole, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a mangled form, which contains the information about what you were like, but in an unrecognizable state. " <p> yes, i am on medications. I see a psychiatrist also. I go to therapy on a bi weekly basis. The problem with schizophrenia is that they can not tell whats real and whats not real so they believe the real voices. I also do so. But anyways, <p> In my day to day life, I do n't really think too much about these matters so I can not easily provide you with an ' executive summary ' of the topic. Perhaps one of our science types will jump in with more details. <p> I am schizophrenic, can we look at the possibility that reincarnation is the reason i am hearing voices?

I think because of the parallel universe question this applies to science. or that this is a science question in a way. <p> Hey there, I think you will find many people suffer from various forms of mental illness, so you 're not alone there, the thing is though that usually people that are thus afflicted may suffer from any number of hallucinations, delusions or hear voices. This is why they are given medication and treatment to prevent these problems occuring. Science has no records of anybody ever actually being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think it 's pretty safe to assume what you are hearing or imagining is n't real. I would stongly suggest though you discuss these thoughts further with your psychiatrist so they can help you stay grounded in reality. <p> I am happy to tell you about black holes, but there is a whole page on Wikipedia which explains them very well so I wo n't even paraphrase and just instead give you the opening quote and wiki link, should you wish to continue reading : <p> " A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called " black " because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that event horizons emit radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater. " <p> I would also like you to understand that there is nothing to be frightened of from black holes, they are beyond our complete understanding and certainly beyond any measure of control we may have, so they will do what they will do, interesting to learn about but also certainly irrelevant to be afraid of worried by. Anything beyond our control is not worth worry or fear, it would just be a waste of time. <p> Schizophrenia affects about 1% of human populations across the world. So you 're not alone. The big issue for each person with the condition is how they respond to it and how well the treatment works. <p> The biggest issue is insight into how it affects you. Many schizophrenics learn to recognise that the voices are not real things and can ignore what they say just as anyone can not bother taking notice of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio playing in the background. Others seem unable to learn this. Despite having had the condition for years they will respond automatically to what the voices tell them to do without question or reflection. <p> We can have no inkling of how you are nor of what your therapists are trying to achieve with you. But a good thing for you to focus on, I suspect, would be on working out a way to think about whether you want to pay any attention to the voices at all or to pick and choose from what the voices say rather than presume that they 're saying anything important or relevant. <p> I 'm not particularly smart when it comes to parallel universes or medical diagnosis, but I would suggest that schizophrenia is a very serious condition and perhaps the best way to go about easing your suffering is not to focus on things which modern science is only on the fringes of understanding. If it provides you with a distraction, so be it, but if you put all your efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed. <p> That is a standard response from a troll when accused of being a troll. Certainly, someone unfamiliar with forums may not know what a forum troll is : but they will almost certainly know what a troll is. And even if they did n't know what a troll was, then the reply to " Do you think claiming to be schizophrenic gives you a troll pass? " would be : " What is a ' troll pass '? ". Just sayin '. <p> I am schizophrenic, can we look at the possibility that reincarnation is the reason i am hearing voices? Perhaps we do n't know everything about the process of reincarnation. I have only come up with : maybe we have some connection to our past lives because we leave something behind in every universe or if theres only one universe in this universe and from every life we live. You might need to know about reincarnation to answer this the way i want you to. <p> i have also wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cause for my illness.

I think because of the parallel universe question this applies to science. or that this is a science question in a way. <p> You know there is at least one mind in your brain... where there is one there may be more! <p> The voices you hear are produced in your own brain in a similar way to how the brain produces your dreams. So just like dreams the voices are real to you, and can be dangerous for you if you trust them! Remember that YOU are the master in your brain, the voices are like " cancer minds " trying to take you over... trying to make you do their bidding. Did you notice that dreams have no moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably not self conscious... they are disassociated parts of the " thinking machinery " that is the origin of your thoughts... You probably understand that you do nt really create your own thoughts? You wish and " reach out " for a thought and the thought develops in front of your " mental eye ". When you are close to sleep you sometimes get thoughts in your mind that you did nt yourself bring up! Your voices are stronger examples of the same phenomenon. Ordinary people have stronger barriers against voices so they do nt usually hear them... but they are there in all of us! Remember NEVER to believe in what they say... NEVER EVER TRUST THEM! <p> You probably have dreams, they seam real when you experience them but are not, right? I get dreams too. These are not messages from another dimension but signals that fire up in our brains, and our brain has the tendency to give meaning and weave a continuum to what it perceives, most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes it does n't. <p> Imo our brain creates patterns that are representations of what we have experienced before. When we perceive something, this pattern is associated to patterns or models we have established and we recognize the new pattern as an apple, or a person, or associate properties its far( small) or near( larger). This means that for everything you see that you have seen before, there may be a pattern in your brain, a model which can be associated with a number of properties, objects and events that are also modeled in your brain. This allows you to recognize stuff, but also to imagine stuff that does nt exist, which is a helpful ability, to create, imagine, or recall things you do nt see( where did I put my keys?). Its similar with hearing, you have patterns of sounds words music voices in your brain, models that allow you to relate the sound pattern to th correct words, and allows youu to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your mouth or to imagine and formulate ideas, phrases( " yeah if she was there I would say hey how about a movie. Hey Im thinking and not actually talking, whoo-hoo, Im talking in my head, maybe she will say... hey Id like to see the new girly movie, hey Im imagining myself talking and also imagining her voice talking back at me "). Think about Bill Clinton, remember his voice, " I did not have sexual relations... ", JFK with his accent " because its hard ", or Palpatine in Star Wars " I can feeeeel your anger ", theres a vast, vast, array of dialogue from many characters in your brain that you can recall from movies and people you have heard talking in some situations, thats on top of the ability to imagine phrases. <p> So when our brain is stimulated in certain ways, we experience hallucinations, and there is often no way to distinguish it from reality because reality( as experienced/perceived) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created based on stimulus from the outside for which there 's a half decent match with patterns we already have, and hallucinations are triggered internally. By the way, when people drive fast, we all experience hallucinations in a way, that is, the brain makes approximations about objects location in our field of vision and when the objects move too fast( because we drive fast) its processing speed ability is exceeded it has a hard time being precises but takes best guesses as to where objects are( whether its really there or not, we see the approximation), which means that if an object disappears, for a fraction of a second or a second you will REALLY SEE an object that is NOT Really there. On top of that our brain as I said gives **28;819;TOOLONG the experience, so that even things that are nt right sorta appear to be real or make sense, most of the time. <p> So your brain has all the mechanisms to create voices you hear, a giant database @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying, the ability to imagine voices you invent and a mechanism to make it appear real( because most of the time what we experience is a useful representation of whats going on around us, it makes the experience better and helps you make better decisions to have an experience where all things are tied up and relations are perceived, but sometimes it not an accurate representation but that 's usually the exception) <p> I think you have to learn that you must question what you perceive based on context, if theres no one to make the sound, you know that in your case there is a huge chance theres no one there and that you are having a mini audio dream, and ignore it. Use context to evaluate it. Unlike most people( newbies) who do nt have hallucinations and would think hey theres an invisible man that no one sees( because its not happen to them yet), you can be a more experienced guy and figure out quickly that there is actually no one there @ @ @ @ @ @
