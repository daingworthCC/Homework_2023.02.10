5067541 <p> Designed in the wake of the Haitian earthquake, LuminAID is the world 's first inflatable #solar light. Waterproof and easy to ship, it lasts longer than a battery-powered flashlight, is safer than a kerosene lamp, and does n't require expensive rechargeable batteries. #inventions <p> Warren Loomis ' 62 Th ' 65 thought that rowers should know where they 're going. He designed a rowboat that combines the motion of a rowing machine with a rear-mounted propeller. He and his sons then founded the Faceforward! company to manufacture and sell the novel craft. #inventions <p> The Hill Breaker uses centrifugal force to regulate speed. A pair of pivoting brake shoes rotates within a brake drum fixed to the axle. At low speeds the brake shoes are held back by springs. As the centrifugal force exceeds the spring force, the brake shoes pivot outwards against the brake drum, generating smooth resistance that increases with speed.
