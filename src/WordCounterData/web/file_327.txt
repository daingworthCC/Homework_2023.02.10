5059441, " Pre-order all three items " <h> Editorial Reviews <h> Review <p> " McNiff is able to expand the reader 's view of what it means to truly live with the labyrinthine path of the creative spirit, conveying an unlimited sense of the ways of the lived imagination. " -- Common Boundary <p> " The instructions and insights in this ' artist 's guide to letting go ' can lead you to creative heights and depths no matter what your medium. " -- Yoga Journal <h> About the Author <p> Shaun McNiff is internationally recognized as a founder and leading figure in the arts and healing field. University Professor at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he is past president of the American Art Therapy Association and the author of several other books including Art As Medicine, Trust the Process, and Creating with Others. <p> This book helps and inspires me( a visual artist) in a way that Julia Cameron 's popular( and wonderful) work has not. For those of us who have a kneejerk negative reaction to following rules and doing " exercises " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a refreshing alternative to her more structured approach. McNiff emphasizes that the sense of despair we feel when the " flow " is n't flowing is itself an integral part of the process of making art, which I found particularly encouraging and true to my experience. He also encourages the reader to get going by creating multiple small, " disposable " works, which can contain the roots of larger pieces... Read this book! <p> I have done visual art and writing for nearly 20 years.Several years ago I hit what first appeared to be a " dry spell ". To my dismay that " spell " become a year, then two, then three and so on. I found myself profoundly blocked on all levels and the creative energy seemed to have left me altogether. I fell into a state of depression, due in part to this loss of creative energy which felt much like a loss of that which is most core to me. No what what I tried, the door remained tightly closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to reopen this door I looked at nearly every book on creativity and things on the market. Many of them lacked the substance and understanding that I needed. Some were aimed at people that had never been creative and therefore the exercises never worked for me. Others used almost a Twelve Step approach which, while effective for some, did n't work for me personally. Like another reviewer said I, too, found many of the " Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... " approaches to be more frustrating and limiting, only further closing this door of creative expression. <p>... I had never read the book, but decided to buy it based on some good reviews and a large dose of desperation. I was skeptical and figured I would likely be disappointed by yet another run of the mill " how to be creative " work. <p> I could n't have been more wrong. When I finally began reading the book it felt different - totally different. I found things that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist that has lost the inspiration and creative flow. It felt like a tangible guide that had the potential of reopening that locked door. <p> The book has helped me move into a place that I had previously thought to be gone forever. While I am not back to creative art at the same frequency I was before, the door has been opened a crack and that is enough to keep me working, to keep me moving forward and working to break the door free from its hinges. <p> I bought this book partially because of the positive reviews. That is why I felt that it was my responsibility to write a review as well. Perhaps it may encourage someone else in my situation to consider this book. It is n't a magical cure because the author is far too practical to attempt to provide one to the reader. Rather it is a sequence of little steps that snowball and produce a result that is often surprising and significant. <p> If I had to recommend a single book on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever form, I would recommend this one. <p> To the author, I remain grateful for the keys to a door that leads me to the most important place in my life - the expression and of life through creativity. Thank you, thank you, thank you. <p> This is simply one of the best books on the subject of personal creativity &; art. Author McNiff does n't get preachy and didactic, and always gets to the point. He also does n't engage the reader with " new age " solutions and descriptions. Clear and balanced. <p> If you have a curiosity about your creativity, or bringing about artistic expression in your life, or you 're an artist on the " path "
