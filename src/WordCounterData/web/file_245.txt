The Little Cat Who Thought She Was Human The Little Dog Who Thought He Was Human Quotes : A life guide The Little Horse Who Thought He Was Human Once upon a time there was a little horse who thought he was human. His name was Comet. The little horse was owned by a young boy named Angus. Comet loved his home in his field, with his stable and all of his hay. All day long the little horse ran around the field and ate hay and oats. He was a very happy little horse. Angus talked to the little horse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I. So the little horse thought he was a human too. Comet always neighed to Angus when he wanted something. Comet thought he was talking like you and I do, and he did n't understand why sometimes Angus could n't understand him when he wanted something. He thought Angus should understand everything he said. * * * * One day Comet neighed to Angus, " Na-a-a-y, na-a-y. " " What do you want little horse? " Angus asked. Comet neighed and nodded to Angus. Angus said, " Oh, you want some water. " " Yes, " Comet neighed to Angus, thinking he was talking like we do. So Angus gave Comet some water and the little horse neighed very happily. * * * * The next day Comet neighed to Angus, " Na-a-a-y, na-a-y, na-a-y. " " What do you want little horse? " Angus asked. The little horse neighed and nodded to Angus. Angus said, " Oh, you want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus, thinking he was talking like a human. Then the little horse trotted to the middle of the field and galloped back to Angus. " Ohh, " Angus said. " You want some more hay. " " Yes, " Comet neighed happily, thinking he was talking like we do. So Angus patted Comet and gave him lots more hay and oats to eat, and the little horse was very happy. * * * * The next day Comet neighed to Angus again, " Na-a-a-y, na-a-y, p-ffff. " " What do you want Comet? " Angus asked. The little horse neighed and nodded. Angus said, " Oh, you want some water. " " No, " Comet shook his head and neighed, thinking he was talking like a human. The little horse trotted away and then galloped back to Angus. " Oh, " Angus said. " You want some more oats. " " No, no, " the little horse neighed and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs slightly and back down, then trotted around in a circle. " Ohhh, I know what you want now, " Angus said. " You want some exercise and play time. " " Yes, " Comet neighed happily. So Angus put Comet 's reigns on and they played and ran around all day long in the green field. Comet was very happy. * * * * The next day Comet neighed to Angus again, " Na-a-a-y, na-a-y, p-ffff, p-ffff. " " What do you want little horse? " Angus asked. The little horse neighed and nodded. Angus said, " Oh, you want some oats. " " No, " Comet neighed, thinking he was talking like a human. The little horse trotted around in a circle and back to Angus. " Oh, " Angus said. " You want to play in the field. " " No, no, " the little horse neighed and shook his head. The little horse nudged Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another circle. Comet then looked at the horse reigns on the fence, then nudged Angus on the arm with his nose again. " Ohhh, I know what you want now, " Angus said. " You want us to go for a ride. " " Yes, " Comet nodded and neighed happily. So Angus took Comet to his stable and put his saddle and reigns on. Angus and the little horse went for a long ride through the countryside and this made Comet feel very happy. * * * * The next day Comet neighed to Angus again, " Prrhhough, na-a-a-y, na-a-y. " " What do you want little horse? " Angus asked. The little horse neighed and nodded. Angus said, " Oh, you want some water. " " No, " Comet neighed, thinking he was talking like a human. The little horse trotted away, then galloped back to Angus. " Ohh, " Angus said. " You want some more hay. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighed and shook his head. Comet nudged Angus on the arm with his nose. " Oh, I know, " Angus said. " You want me to go for a ride. " " No, no, no, " Comet neighed loudly and shook his head. The little horse lifted his two front legs and then put them back down again. " Ohhh, I know what you want now, " Angus said. " You want me to brush you. " " Yes, " Comet neighed happily and feeling very excited. So Angus picked up Comet 's big horse brush and brushed Comet all over his little horse body and his mane. The little horse loved being brushed and he was very happy. * * * * The next day Comet neighed quitely to Angus, " Na-a-a-y, na-a-a-y. " " What do you want little horse? " Angus asked. Comet neighed softly to Angus again. " Oh, you want some water, " Angus said. " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slowly. Comet used his nose again to nudge Angus in the arm. " Oh, I know " Angus said. " You want some more oats. " " No, no, no, " Comet shook his head, then neighed and sighed quietly. The little horse looked over at his stable, then looked at Angus and nodded his head. Angus said quietly, " Ohhh, I know what you want now, you want to go to sleep. " " Yes, " Comet neighed and nodded wearily. So Angus took Comet to his stable and covered him up with his little horse blanket and whispered, " Good night little Comet. It 's time to go to sleep now. " And soon after that, Comet was sound asleep. The end! * * * * About the Author Trinity R. Westfield is a certified Life Coach, trained in cognitive behaviours and metaphysics.
