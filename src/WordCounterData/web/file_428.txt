5069641 <h> Construction Site Offers Fleeting Glimpse of the Civil War Past <p> Archaeologists in Fredericksburg, Va., last week. On the site of a $35 million courthouse complex, they have excavated artifacts buried since an 1862 battle. <h> By THEO EMERY <h> Published : November 11, 2012 <p> FREDERICKSBURG, Va. -- The first bullet surfaced just after lunch. As Jon Tucker sifted soil through a screen in September, a corroded lead slug jiggled into view amid the sand and ash excavated from a pit just a few feet from a fenced-off sidewalk and rushing traffic. <h> Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times <h> Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times <p> Jon Tucker, an archaeologist, sifted last week through dirt from the Civil War-era excavation site, which is in a downtown historic district. <p> Mr. Tucker waved to his supervisor, Taft Kiser, the lead archaeologist on the site, and held up the bullet for him to see. It would not be the last time. Hundreds of artifacts followed, along with the contours of a buried cellar holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1862 battle in this Virginia city, which today lies just beyond the suburbs of Washington. <p> The discovery amid construction of a courthouse was unexpected. But the site has astonished historians and archaeologists for another reason : it represents a " time capsule, " in the words of Mr. Kiser, a rare snapshot in time, undisturbed through more than a century of urban construction around it. <p> Since then, the crew 's shovels and trowels have scraped away cinders and sand to reveal the basement 's contents : Dozens of bullets. Buttons from Union jackets. Shards from whiskey bottles. A metal plate from a cartridge box. Chinstrap buckles. Tobacco pipes. A brick fireplace and charred floorboards. <p> " This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, " said Mr. Kiser, 53, as Brynn Stewart, the project manager, nodded beside him. With the project paused, the team raced to document what they concluded was the basement of a building set afire shortly after the Battle of Fredericksburg. The timing was opportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fredericksburg has been preparing to mark the sesquicentennial. <p> " No one, of course, calculated that, but it is a pleasant happenstance that most of us in our lifetimes wo n't ever see again, " said John Hennessy, a National Park Service historian. <p> Such sites are a kind of archaeological Brigadoon, the fictional Scottish village that appeared once a century. They come unexpectedly amid construction, scientists and historians have only a brief period to document them, and then construction resumes, destroying the site. <p> Most archaeological artifacts today are unearthed because of development, said Joe B. Jones, the director of the Center for Archaeological Research at the College of William &; Mary in Williamsburg. <p> " Until people start breaking ground, only then do people realize what they 've got there, and everybody 's got to scramble to find a way to deal with it in a responsible way, " he said. <p> In Fredericksburg 's case, city planners hired Mr. Kiser 's firm to investigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthouse complex, as they would require a private developer to do in a historic district. <p> There was no expectation that the investigators would find anything. When the archaeologists initially checked city records, they were unable to find any indication that a building had been on the propery before 1886. <p> " We 're ecstatic about what we found, " said Robert K. Antozzi, the city 's coordinator for the courthouse project. " Now we have a major expansion of the story of Fredericksburg, and that 's really exciting. " <p> Shortly into the dig, the crew discovered a sandstone cellar wall -- a clue that something was preserved below. When they dug at another location, it found a brick wall flush against the sidewalk on Princess Anne Street, which runs through downtown. <p> The dig revved from a sleepy investigation into a dash to extract as much information as possible. <p> The crew also discovered an 18th century well and latrines across the site, where livery stables once stood. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid portrait of the aftermath of the battle, when Ambrose Burnside, the general of the Union forces, tried to take the city from the Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, as Union forces forged toward Richmond. <p> In the lead-up to the battle, Burnside showered the city with artillery to dislodge Lee 's forces. There was door-to-door street fighting -- a Civil War rarity -- and evidence that federal troops rampaged through the city, looting and vandalizing. <p> There, the soldiers would have opened tins of food and warmed themselves around the fireplace. They broke out whiskey bottles, and smoked tobacco pipes. As they entered the basement, they were probably told to empty their rifles to prevent accidental discharges, which resulted in a pile of ammunition on the floor. <p> The next day, the Union generals ordered their troops to fall back across the Rappahannock River, and Joseph Hooker, a major general, told officers to check houses for Union troops who had taken shelter. At some point, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, sealing in its contents. <p> The fire 's date is unknown, but the building probably burned soon after Union soldiers abandoned it, perhaps because of Confederate artillery. A photo taken the following spring suggests that the building was gone. <p> Almost 150 years later, Mr. Kiser, a burly man with a salt-and-pepper beard and a ponytail, bounded around the site, suggesting last-minute spots for the crew to investigate. As a reminder of the urgency, a backhoe hulked nearby, ready for the project to restart. <p> Mr. Tucker passed a plastic bucket containing shards of pottery and clay roof tile to Mr. Kiser for inspection, and then a pewter button a few moments later. " That is going to be 18th or early 19th century, " Mr. Kiser said, turning the button over in his calloused hands. <p> The project historian, Brian Schools, was still studying the layers of dirt for anything that might still lie below, and another crew member was sketching the brick wall. <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew had worked at a breakneck pace to find everything that it could before time ran out. " Thirty-minute lunches, " Mr. Kiser joked. " You do n't want to lose something because have a second cup of coffee.
