5038741 <p> Google+ is now allowing the creating of business pages. Previously Google+ was only open to individuals. Now you can create a business page for your brand on Google+. Since Google basically owns search and all their other properties like YouTube, Blogger.com and Google Places get priority in search it would not be a bad idea to have a Google+ business page in addition to your personal profile. <p> However, to start with Google+ you first need to create a personal profile. It is from within the personal profile that the business page is created. Here is an article telling you how to get started with Google+. <p> To create a Google+ business page you need to go here. If you are not logged into your Google account you will be prompted to do so. <p> The first thing you need to do is to pick a category. You have a choice of 5 main categories. <p> 1. Local Business Or Place- This is generally for local brick and mortar businesses like hotels, restaurants, local stores and services that focus on the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches an existing Google Places page it will take the information from the Google Places page. If not, you need to fill out the information for your business. <p> Note : I have noticed that in some markets Google+ business pages were given priority listing for local search where there were not already a lot of Google Places pages. The Google+ pages were ranking first for local search above the regular natural listings. So local businesses should really pay attention to Google+ and create a business page. Check out these search results for " Doctors Mumbai ". One of the Google Places listings is a Google+ page. The Google+ page generally goes to the about section so make sure you fill this section out completely and include your keywords. <p> 3. Company Institution or Organization -- This is for different types of organizations, including but exclusively non-profits. <p> 4. Arts Entertainment and Sports <p> 5. Other -- If you do not feel your page fits into any of the above categories you can choose ' Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also choose whether your page 's content is suitable for any Google+ user, users 18 or older, users 21 or older or specifically note that the content will be alcohol-related. I have seen edgy adult related sites on Google+ so it seems Google+ is allowing some adultish content because they are asking you to identify such content when you register your page rather than outright banning it. <p> This is all I could find in Google+ TOS : " Further, we may not allow verification of local Google+ pages for certain products and services such as escort services or other regulated goods. " The door looks cautiously open on this subject. <p> Customize Your Page 's Public Profile <p> Now you need to customize your page 's public profile. This is important. Make sure you fill everything out completely. Use your keywords without stuffing. Tell everything about your business, including relevant links. Do not just skip quickly over this section. The information here is what will be used to find you in search. Chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main website so pack this section with relevant info. <p> 1. Add your profile photo and tagline. <p> 2. Edit your page information. Click on the profile icon at the top left then go to the About tab and edit profile. Include as much information and as many appropriate links as possible. <p> 3. Add your Photostrip. The photostrip are the five photos that will be displayed beneath your page 's name and tagline. While editing your profile, click on the photo area where it says " add photos here " and upload a photo in each of the five photo spots. <p> Your business page is now ready! You can start adding posts and content to this page just like you did with your personal Google+ profile. Once you have filled your page with some quality content you can use the " Spread the word " option in your right sidebar to announce your page to your personal profile connections. <p> The big difference between a Facebook fanpage and a Google+ business page is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add them to your circles. This allows for more interaction and more interaction with those specifically interested in one topic. <p> Anytime Google comes out with a new online property it 's a good idea to find a way to make use of it. As this article says, Google gives it 's own properties preferential treatment in it 's search results. <p> I have been wondering how and when to do a Google+ page for our business. This easy description encourages me to take the step. With a Facebook page and a LinkedIn page to manage as well as our website and related blog adding another vehicle has just seemed too much challenge. This description takes some of the challenge away. Now on with the work. <p> Thanks for this incredibly useful article! I 've already started a business page for a client, and I 'm sure I 'll be making many more. <p> I do wonder why Google forces you to upload videos, when they now own YouTube. Would n't it just be simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's rather time-intensive to upload them all again, but I 'm sure the SEO benefits will be worth it. <p> Good luck Lee. I am glad this is simplifying the process. I know that it is a bit much trying to manage all these social media accounts. I am starting to set up Google+ business pages for each of my sites. Might as well have another representation of your brand on Google. <p> @Trey Collier Nice info on the contributor code. I found this for the vanity urls http : //gplus.to/ but it looks more like a shortener which would not necessarily have the same seo effects as a real google keyword vanity url like with Facebook. <p> @Matthew Meyer Yes, that is a currently a way to get a " temporary " vanity URL. It 's a basic 301 redirect from a non-sponsored Google company and not what is supposed to be coming down the pipe from what I understand. <p> Oh. I previously mentioned that author 's should like their posts to the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Author " tags, your G+ account should link back to your content in the Profile where you " Contribute " and the little picture that shows up in the SERPs will only show up if you have established a 2-way Authorship( or 3 way, but beyond scope here) AND the primary image of your personal account IS a RL image of a face. <p> Do a search for ' Coolaroo shade sail ' and you should see my pic show up on the SERPs. I 've recently established authorship. When the pic shows up, it draws the searchers attention to it, and from what others report, increases Click Thru Rates of about 28%. <p> I mention this as I see that your profile pic is that of your Book and now of your face( Matthew Meyer) <p> PS : Two individuals on Google+ for their expertise are AJ Kohn, and Mark Traphagen. I 'd highly suggest ANYONE circle these two and read their posts on " Google Authorship " or " Author Rank " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my profile photo to a real photo. I also added my own blog to the contributor area. I will read up according to your recommendations to learn more about authorship. I believe you about the clickthrough rates. I have been seeing posts with the photos and I am much more inclined to click on those. Thank you! <p> I would say at least 95% of these Google Places listings break Quality Guideline rules and nothing is done about it. <p> Even though my clients on Google Places are ranking very well, I often hesitate to offer it to new clients, in fact I dread it because of the BS involved. You follow the quality guideline rules, then you get " We currently do not support that location ". But the listing is active and the verification postcard came to the very business location that G says it 's not supporting. Go figure. <p> So, I 'll just monitor this newest G play gadget before offering it to my clients.
