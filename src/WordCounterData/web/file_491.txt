5075941 <h> Lonely bench <p> As a child, I used to wait impatiently for my grandfather to come home from work. Despite my parents ' displeasure, I would hang onto the rails of the garden fence and stare across the pasture in anticipation of his arrival. After hearing the sound of a taxi coming to a stop, I would jump over the fence and excitedly run across the field. My grandfather would look up and smile as he saw me sprint through the grass. As I neared, he would set his suitcase aside, crouch down and extend his arms so that he could catch me and throw me up into the air repetitively. It was customary. My grandfather would put me down, tussle my hair and hold my hand as we walked back to the backyard. <p> Years later when I was in the fifth grade, I realized my immaturity. After coming home from work one day, my grandfather sat down on the bench next to the fragrant lemon tree, kicked back and motioned for me to sit next to him. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely to what he was about to say. Unaccustomed to serious conversations at such a young age, I prevented myself from smiling and put my head onto my grandfather 's shoulder. <p> " As you grow older, you will learn to be patient. Despite the troubles you will endure, you must understand that not every solution is within your reach. During these times, you 'll realize that everything you need will be in your heart and your mind. Everything you need to remain strong is right here. " <p> My grandfather tapped his right index finger on my chest and then on my head as a tear streamed down his face. I did n't know why he was crying, but I assumed that it was because our plane was leaving the next day, and that the next time I would see him would probably be in another four years. I pondered his words for a while and looked up at my grandfather. He looked back at me and smiled at my confused expression. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage but was n't able to shed one tear in response. Perhaps it was because I was still pondering what he had just told me. Perhaps it was because I did n't know what my grandfather was going through. I was too young to understand. <p> I sat quietly during our eight-hour commute back home. Sometime during the flight, I wrote down a rough translation of what my grandfather had told me on a napkin that was given to me by the flight attendant. I never told anyone of our discussion the day before, nor did I ask anyone what his words meant. <p> I never knew that a few days before we left, my grandfather had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He refused to tell anyone, even my grandmother, until he started feeling very sick a few months later. <p> One year after we had left, my grandfather passed away. The last time I saw him, the last time I ever spoke to him, was that day when we both sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I would understand what my grandfather had been trying to tell me. It all makes sense now. Despite the diagnosis, my grandfather never let the illness affect his life. He remained strong and presided over family matters regardless of what would happen a year later. He laughed, told jokes and went about his life in a way no different than he had done so in the past, all the while refusing to let the cancer impact his attitude, personality or commitment to family. He remained faithful, blamed no one and taught many to remain thankful despite the incomparable difficulty he was facing. <p> When I look back at that moment and remember what my grandfather had told me, I realize that I have n't been living by his advice. I have n't remained strong, nor have I been thankful for my blessings. Who the hell am I to complain about my life? I would never be able to compare the insubstantial worries that trouble me now to those that affected my grandfather. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather would go to work, ride the taxi back, walk through the field and sit on that same bench every day since I had left -- something that he had never done before our conversation. In the midst of the incomparable struggles that I face, I strive to remember the wisdom that my grandfather aimed to instill in me. <p> On this day, I regret that I was not able to sit next to him on the days when he sat alone. <p> Happy birthday, Grandpa. <p> Mousa Alshanteer is a Trinity freshman.
