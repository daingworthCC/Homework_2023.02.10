She is also involved with the suffragette movement.( We are now about a century on and it seems crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, would I have condoned a movement which broke the law in order to make a law? Too much of my sympathy was with the innocent victims.) Matthew is a first class cricketer who would like to be team captain.( Even though I do actually enjoy watching a good cricket match I do n't want to read ball-by-ball accounts of fictional games.) As a couple they spend most of their time mis-understanding each other. Consequently for two people who are supposed to know their own minds their romance is practically non-existent. The story becomes much more interesting when the war intervenes and they have more weighty problems to consider.

Could be enjoyed simply as a light romance, but written with more serious intent and reviewed as literary fiction by most of the broadsheets. The central characters are an independently minded young woman and a rather stuffy county cricketer, who are strongly attracted to each other but struggle to get beyond their political positions. There are a number of significant peripheral figures, especially a working class senior cricketer trying to come to terms with impending retirement, and a bohemian artist. This central group of characters are followed over a period of a decade or so, which includes the first world war. <p> The serious theme which is addressed here is how difficult it is to properly know another person and to understand what is going on in their mind. This is hardly an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman " to quote from elsewhere), but it is a worthy theme for a serious writer. This novel is full of instances of one person failing to understand another properly, sometimes explicitly. Indeed, sometimes this is highlighted so explicitly that I felt I was being hit over the head by the author with a metaphorical hammer. However, this is a minor criticism, because overall the book succeeded by making me care about the characters and their fate. The ending was too formulaic, but maybe this is the author 's point -- better accept that we ca n't fully understand each other and grasp what consolation we can get. And if a person is worth getting to know, then do n't give up too easily. Would make a good choice for Richard and Judy 's Book Club, or a very British romantic comedy. <p> The idea sounds interesting : a novel about the the women 's suffrage movement, the first World War, and cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first two.

Alas, the work itself is terrible. <p> Imagine a book by a contemporary man attempting to sound like a woman attempting to sound like E. M Forster. This is it. Numerous elements of the story are both psychologically unconvincing and practically implausible, even within the context of the fluid realities of the early 20th century. The prose is frequently anachronistic( e.g., " too much on our plates ") and even more frequently purple, verging on bodice-ripper territory. Cliches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of stock characters such as the mustache-twirling villain. I very seldom fail to finish a book, but I was hard-pressed to get to the end of this one. <p> Apparently, HALF OF THE HUMAN RACE was well-received in England, which I find even more inexplicable than the enthusiastic reception given A.S. Byatt 's THE CHILDREN 'S BOOK a couple of years ago. The two have many faults in common, including substantial disgorgements of undigested research. But even Byatt 's characters are more authentic. <p> OK, I have finished it. I did nt dislike the book as I thought the characters were all brought to life well, overall it was a well told story. But I am afraid I just couldnt warm to it. The story is set Pre and during and post WW1 and includes the movement of the suffragets.

The story is set Pre and during and post WW1 and includes the movement of the suffragets. The two main characters are a headstrong female desperate to be come a doctor and a cricket playing male of society. I liked the flow of the story, nothing appeared to be lost or forgotten in the telling of this major historical time in London. The hint at the professional sports player 's life post sport is poignent, and one that we non-celebs should remember is all too often the case. But overall i feel it was just an " ok " read. Its not one I would rush to recommend reading. And on this basis I am not sure why it has been picked for the @TVBookClub 2012. Have also just remembered something that really annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a proper name!?!?!( less) <p> Really enjoyed this.

Sadly it seems unlikely knowing the obstacles she would have faced, especially if she did marry Will, but I was dying to know.( less) <p> An enjoyable read - I particularly liked the descriptions of life after the war something I 'm really not familiar with and had n't previously thought about. A lot of books I 've read recently have been crammed with literary quotes just shoe-horned in which I hate - this book had none of that pretentiousness and was all the better for it.

Would have liked more detail on how everything turned out especially regarding Connie 's career, but that did n't spoil the book for me. I found this book by searching for one similar to ' one day ', and like that book, I enjoyed the story continuing through the passage of time and seeing the characters change and develop. I read this in a few days rather than desperately devouring it in one go as I often do but that 's no bad thing.( less) <p> I found this book enjoyable and disappointing in equal measures.

Set in the earlier part of the twentieth century, the novel 's backdrops illustrate the tumultuous climate in Britain in a period were women were fighting for the right to vote and the country was fighting ' a war to end all wars '. Whilst I had little interest in Will 's world of cricket, I would have loved the author to devote more of the novel to the Suffragette movement. The portrayal of life in the trenches was gritty and vivid, as was Connie 's experience as Sister Callaway. Many interesting subjects were touched on, perhaps too many, and I think this is what contributes to the novel 's downfall. Despite this I found the two main charaters to be likeable and well written. Connie and Will would have had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the twentieth century, and I could empathise with the frustrations of both. Quite a decent book overall, but the blurb is somewhat misleading! <p> I found this the perfect book for a long weekend spent at home. This is an unashamed love story without cynicism or any attempt to be too clever. Instead, Quinn( I am assuming no relation to Zorba the Greek) allows us to get lost in the relationship between Connie, a dedicated Suffragette and Will, the county cricketer/First World War veteran, along with a gallery of believable characters. As always, that time period in European history provides an inexhaustible backdrop for any story. <p> Feminism and county cricket might seem an un likely combination of themes, but this story succeeds brilliantly in bringing both worlds to life in a romance which covers nine years from 1911 until 1920. <p> I have n't enjoyed a novel more since reading Linda Grant 's " The Clothes on their Backs ". <p> I suppose any historical novel is bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular book is when a player in 1911 describes a century as a " ton ". UGH! <p> I really enjoyed this novel. It is beautiful written in a simple A to B, past tense, third person narrative. It 's such a relief to read something written in a traditional style which allows the plot and characters come to the fore. <p> This novel features some fascinating topics including suffragettes, cricket, World War 1. It is engaging and opens a window on life in the 1910 's.

The main characters, star-crossed lovers Will and Connie, are fully rounded, flawed but likeable people ; it was a joy to spend time in their company. <p> It was lovely to read a book so unashamedly English, I particularly enjoyed reading the scenes at the cricket and I thought that the secondary storyline of retired sportsmen and suicide was very moving and is as relevant now as it was in the early twentieth century. <p> I think it 's an excellent device : cricket and all it 's " fair play " connotations alongside women 's suffrage. I particularly loved the portrayal of the supporting character, the declining old pro. That was so vivid and colourful. The ending was beautiful. <p> Quirky side-effect of reading it is I am dying to settle down to watch a game of cricket! <p> This was a fairly enjoyable read, but it was just TOO LONG. I think that about half of the book could be cut out without altering the story, and it just jumped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cricket and art and human emotion and the suffragette movement and WWI all at the same time, and did n't really convince me in any of them. <p> Who would have thought that a book about the suffragettes, cricket and WWI would work so well? I 'm not a sport fan, but found the characters in this book engaging and very much enjoyed the look at the suffragette movement. It stayed with me for a long while after I finished it. <p> Who would have thought that a book about the suffragettes, cricket and WWI would work so well? I 'm not a sport fan, but found the characters in this book engaging and very much enjoyed the look at the suffragette movement. <p> This book had a very slow start and to begin with, I really disliked most of the characters. But it got better and towards the end, I was hooked as to what would happen to the suffragette Connie, the cricketer Will and all their friends and family. <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of women just less than 100 years ago. I think young women today should know of the sufrage movement so that they do n't take their right for granted. <p> A long read yet so worth it. Character driven and highly descriptive this was such an easy pleasurable book to read which left me in parts frustrated and warmed, just lovely, I 'll definitely be seeing out more of Quinn 's work. <p> A long, slow read, but I gobbled it up, lost in the period( Edwardian London) and the intertwined lives of Connie and Will. Their struggles, both personal and societal - dealing with the Suffragete movement, cricket, suicide, social expectations, imprisonment, the Great War, amongst other things - unfold and develop, impacting on their own lives and those around them. I stayed up long past my bedtime to finish this : the sign of a good book! <p> Just finished this book in a record( I think) 4 days and I already miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed descriptions of London streets... Think cricket, suffragettes and WW1.... and throw in dash of the ever present English class system, a love story and bingo you have a really good tale. <p> I find myself quite torn on this book! It is worth a read and in some ways I enjoyed it but I felt slightly disappointed throughout. Interesting concept for a story - WWI, the suffragettes... And do n't let the cricket aspect put you off, it does n't affect the story to a great degree. I probably would n't read this again, I just did n't warm to it that much. <p> This exceptional novel explores themes of friendship, love, family, and politics, and, set in a fascinating period of British history and with a beautifully charismatic heroine at its heart, this makes for an incredibly compelling and touching read. <p> Anthony Quinn was born in Liverpool in 1964.
