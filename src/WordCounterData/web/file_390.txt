5065841 <h> Should a Figure Skater Relocate to Follow His or Her Ice Skating Dream? <p> " My daughter is getting ready to take her Juvenile freestyle test. She is 13 1/2 years old. Our rink has no ice dance, no partners, and no synchronized skating. She wants to go on with her skating, but there is nothing here for her. Given her age and test level, would it be worth it to move to a town that offers all figure skating disiplines? Is she too old to be a competitive figure skater? Our highest level coaches only skated through the Juvenile level, and that was 30 years ago. Our figure skating club is currently ISI, with practically no US Figure Skating. " <p> In my opinion, sometimes serious figure skaters must leave their homes and families to train. If at all possible, I believe it is best for families to stay together. Spliting families up for the sake of figure skating does not always make sense. If a child does have to relocate for figure skating, I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good choice. Not always is that possible. My brother left home to train with Carlo Fassi when he was only fourteen years old. Our family 's life was never the same after that, so I am a strong believer in keeping families together. <h> Comments <p> April 19, 2009 at 4:50 pm <p>( 1) Christine Ortiz says : <p> Well, I am no expert as I never was a competitive skater like that. The one thing I know, though, is that I had a great passion for skating from an early age and did not get support from my family. To them I was " just playing " and thus never took it seriously. I took it seriously and wish that they had given me the resources to have grown in my sport. As a parent, if my son had a passion for skating like I did and wanted to grow in it I would consider it. Having a child separated from a parent as a teenager, though, would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to a location that was suitable if possible. Of course, there are so many factors such as, how would I support my family financially if we moved. Do I own a house that would have to be sold, rented etc. There are a lot of financial decisions that would have to be made to make sure we could handle that as well. I would want to keep the family together, though, if possible. I went to college in England where boarding schools are commonplace and my high school was a boarding school as well. It was hard on the kids to be away from home as well. For me, I would want to give my child all the opportunities and experiences possible if it is a realistic thing to do. Even if my child was n't going to be able to skate for a living, the life experience they would gain would be invaluable. I am an adventurous spirit, though. I have lived my adult life traveling the world and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me, it would be a family decision, that everyone in the family would have to be happy with. If it was just me and my child I would move in an instant, but since there are other family members we would all have to come to a decision together. It makes me happy, though, that you take an interest in your child 's future and pay attention to their passions. I wish my parents had done that. <p> April 27, 2009 at 9:51 am <p>( 2) tink says : <p> Well I got my answer. She was n't properly trained in " technique ", after hours and thousands of dollars she did n't pass. I guess if we do pursue USFS of any kind we will have to move. The coach here has n't been properly trained at that level. So we got our answer, if you do n't have the
