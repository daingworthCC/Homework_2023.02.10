5080241 <h> Santa Cruz or which way do I go? <p> Santa Cruz or which way do I go? This is a short trip report of a ride I took last weekend to Santa cruz. I had different ideas of where wanted to go last Saturday. I have to say my biggest concern was just getting out of Dodge so to speak. I had wanted to go to Solvang but was to lazy to tell you the truth. Also I decided to sleep in Saturday so I did not leave until 10:00 :( So I followed my regular plan of crawling on to the freeway and seeing where I end up. I started going south on I-5.Nothing like no planning. I think maybe Monterey but how about Santa Cruz. So I am going down the rode at a nice clip and then I see a sign for San Franscico. Maybe I will go there instead. Decisions decisions oh what should I do. That sign is getting closer, what should I do. San Fran is only 90 miles away. Ah screw it, I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This was a chance to try out my new wind screen. I installed the Zero Gravity <p> Super Touring one. For those who want to know, it is great! Before the wind hit me mid chest. Now it its at the chin level. Cuts down on the fatigue big time. So as I am going down I-5 I am down by Santa Nella. I see what I think is a car broke down. Flashers are on. Since there is not a whole lot out there I decide to pull over and be a nice guy to see if I can lend a helping hand. To my surprise this guy comes around the car with a radar gun. It turns out to be a unmark car! Luckily I have slowed down to 60 while getting closer. I just wave as I go by! I wish he could have seen my smile underneath that full coverage hemet :) To me that is wrong on so many levels. By the way, did I mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Cruz instead Of Monterey. One nice nice thing about being on a bike is the ability to explore all the neat places as you travel. So I was not paying attention where I was going <p> and missed my turn off in Gilroy So I pull off the side of the road to ask this guy walking down the street for directions. Come to find out that this guy is hearing impaired! He starts trying to do sign language. Now I must say I know a little sign language but this is way over my head. So I thank him the best I can and travel on. I finally get out of Gilroy and on to Santa Cruz. Cutting off from I-5 I took 152. I really love the rolling hills through here. I thought I would have some good pictures but did not have the right settings on my camera set. I have to pay closer attention to that. Well got to Santa Cruz, the weather was excellent. Went by the board walk. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off season. Went over to the pier and took a walk all the way to the end. Man, that is one long pier. After that, I cruised around town and then headed out for home. Got somewhat lost again, was not sure where my turn was and then a guy <p> pulls up beside me on a really nice V-Strom. He tells me to follow him aways and then peels off to go one way and points me the other direction. I am off and running for home from there. I knew it was going to get cold heading for home. It did! I do n't run any heated cloths but am thinking of investing in some so to be more comfy in the winter. Anyways, got home about 8:00 chilled but not quite frozen. Not a bad day over all. <p> I am starting this blog to keep track of my travels via motorcycle. My aim is to travel the 49 states and the the west coast of Canada on my motorcycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family... full info <p> Britain 's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783.
