5100541 <h> RS <h> MEMBER DIARY <h> Boehner needs to come out of his shellshock or needs to leave <p> Well, you have to give a round of applause to Speaker Boehner for the quick response to President Obama 's victory and Harry Reid 's keeping the Senate. Boehner went to bed Monday night with the Senate in democrat hands, the presidency in democrat hands and the congress in republican control. Wednesday morning he woke up and nothing had changed........ except him. <p> Seems he did n't get the memo that it was only 3 million people who voted for President Obama over Mitt Romney -- the republican candidate and Boehner looked shell shocked when in fact -- NOTHING had changed. <p> President Obama was president on Monday and he was still president on Wednesday. The nasty and truculent Harry Reid of Nevada was Majority leader with Mitch McConnell as Minority Republican leader in the Senate.

Just give up. You know you do n't have the fire in your belly and its all for show. The best action you can take is to move aside and let someone in there who has the knowledge to refute Obama every time the President opens his mouth with real facts. You can be the person 's mentor and everyone will love you for stepping aside. <p> Speaker Boehner needs to do the right thing. His shell shock over Romney losing the Presidency is causing him to lose his fighting spirit -- something we doubted he never had to begin with when he botched the
