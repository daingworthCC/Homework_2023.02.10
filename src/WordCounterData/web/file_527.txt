5079641 <h> Monday, January 3, 2011 <p> Observed the flashing 4 wheel drive, chains light on in the Alta parking lot at 3pm, mon. jan.3, 2011. The road was clear and dry - the last snow had arrived on the previous friday. There was no conceivable reason for 4 wheel drive traffic only. <h> Sunday, January 2, 2011 <p> We have small 3 boys in the valley with a babysitter, and called to explain uncertainty of getting down the canyon. Snowbird employee report( phone line) and Alta report said simply that road was open to 4WD and Chains. Not very helpful. <p> We did not get down the canyon until 8:20 pm. Almost 4 and half hours after we started- luckily our babysitter could feed them dinner.. There was no evidence of an accident on the roadway. No ambulance or firetrucks. And there were no cars in the snowbanks on our way down. The road was very slippery... but it still can not explain the 4+ hour delay. <p> My personal experience since this change : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2) The radio report at the bottom of the canyon is stale and worthless 3) The congestion at the mouth of canyon when closed for avalanche work is much worse, and constantly changing rules. 4) Downstream traffic is much slower. The police will stop traffic anytime( including the peak at 4:30pm) to help a single motorist who has driven into a snowbank( no injuries) and cause hours of delay for thousands of other people. <p> Please add your own comments or knowledge about this transition.in policing <p> A couple years ago, Snowbird started angle-parking cars on the road shoulder above the first entrance. Not only is it terribly inconvenient place to park for their skiers( no walkway), they must disrupt the downstream flow of traffic when they depart later in the day. Often a Snowbird employee will stop traffic descending down the canyon so a car can back-up and join the flow down the canyon. <p> This On-Road parking configuration LOWERS the rate of descending cars per hour by 2 or 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also goes without saying that is penalizes Alta Skiers over Snowbird skiers, who might have to wait 3 hours to descend from Albion parking lot. <h> Real-time Photo <h> Blog Threads <h> About Us <p> AltaRoad is a community effort to solve the delays and congestion in Little Cottonwood Canyon.
