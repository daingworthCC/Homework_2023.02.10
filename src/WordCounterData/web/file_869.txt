5256741 <h> Posted by Jim Hoft on Thursday, November 24, 2011, 10:17 PM <p> In his Thanksgiving message this year, Barack Obama reminded us that the economy still sucks and that we are our brother 's keeper. <p> We 're also grateful for the Americans who are taking time out of their holiday to serve in soup kitchens and shelters, making sure their neighbors have a hot meal and a place to stay. This sense of mutual responsibility -- the idea that I am my brother 's keeper ; that I am my sister 's keeper -- has always been a part of what makes our country special. And it 's one of the reasons the Thanksgiving tradition has endured... <p> I know that for many of you, this Thanksgiving is more difficult than most. But no matter how tough things are right now, we still give thanks for that most American of blessings, the chance to determine our own destiny. The problems we face did n't develop overnight, and we wo n't solve them overnight. But we will solve them. All it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> With all the partisanship and gridlock here in Washington, it 's easy to wonder if such unity is really possible. But think about what 's happening at this very moment : Americans from all walks of life are coming together as one people, grateful for the blessings of family, community, and country. <p> Of course, when Obama reminded us that we are our brother 's keeper, he was n't talking about his brother George. High as a kite, George Obama poses outside his foul-smelling Kenyan slum hut with his friends in Huruma estate. Left to Right : Rastaman, One of the girls in George 's room, George Hussein Obama, Jack, a body guard in the Kenyan slum.( Thaindian) <p> Barack Obama 's brother George, also a community organizer, was arrested on a charge of marijuana possession in 2009. He was interviewed in his slum in 2008. In 2010, George Obama, a former gang member, moved to an apartment near the slum in Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama likes the patronizing racism of being " the white mans burden ". He wants nameless faceless tax payers to keep his brother because he wo n't do it himself. Burden whitey with your drug addicted kin, your gang banger cousin, your high school Ho drop outs because its our historical burden to civilize the jungle monkies. Such was the thinking of the Ivy League educated class way back in the 19th century. Its very racist ideology, but he has personally benefitted very well from it. <h> rasqual commented : <p> For what it 's worth, I like what he said here. It 's one of those rare occasions where he speaks of private charity as salutary, without commending the government as the prime mover to solve social ills. Nice restraint. <p> On the other hand, I weary of the president being expected, apparently, to always " say stuff " on holidays -- holidays for every religion, culture, and turned over rock. <p> I 'm a small government guy who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and those who govern us distantly should be be trivially involved in our day-to-day reality. So in theory, I should value a mayor 's holiday greetings more than a president 's. But I do n't. I do n't care. It 's not their job to mediate significance of the day to us. <h> squeaky commented : <h> JKB commented : <p> Geez, he ca n't even get Thanksgiving right. Does the man know anything beyond the elementary school simplifications taught? <p> The only reason we celebrate Thanksgiving is because after half the colonists had died from deprivations, they had a couple lucky years that they had a big last meal. Only, the governor got smart, threw off the socialistic community ownership system, assigned individual ownership of plots of land, and there after they had a bounty even exporting food a couple years later. <p> So let us be reminded not that we are our brother 's keeper, but that with the collective comes death and deprivation, with true capitalism, free markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and a growing economy. <p> In his ' History of Plymouth Plantation, ' the governor of the colony, William Bradford, reported that the colonists went hungry for years, because they refused to work in the fields. They preferred instead to steal food. He says the colony was riddled with " corruption, " and with " confusion and discontent. " The crops were small because " much was stolen both by night and day, before it became scarce eatable. " <p> In the harvest feasts of 1621 and 1622, " all had their hungry bellies filled, " but only briefly. The prevailing condition during those years was not the abundance the official story claims, it was famine and death. The first " Thanksgiving " was not so much a celebration as it was the last meal of condemned men. <p> But in subsequent years something changes. The harvest of 1623 was different. Suddenly, " instead of famine now God gave them plenty, " Bradford wrote, " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearts of many, for which they blessed God. " Thereafter, he wrote, " any general want or famine hath not been amongst them since to this day. " In fact, in 1624, so much food was produced that the colonists were able to begin exporting corn. <h> kansas commented : <p> We did n't get into this overnight and we will not get out of it..................... until Obama is gone. And he leads Romney, who by the way is not a traitorous foreign agent, in Iowa polls by 44 to 38. So 44 per cent of
