5062441 <h> Do I have to take the NCLEX in the state I graduated from? <p> This is a discussion on Do I have to take the NCLEX in the state I graduated from? in NCLEX Discussion Forum, part of Nursing Student... Hello... I graduated in May this year in Michigan, &nbsp; and my husband accepted a job in Austin... <p> Hello... I graduated in May this year in Michigan, &nbsp; and my husband accepted a job in Austin Texas. I need to take my NCLEX, but I am unsure whether I should or have to take it here or if it 's alright to take it in Texas... He is already living there and my family and I are to follow the fist week of August. &nbsp; Any thoughts on whether it would be harder taking it in you!!!! <p> Print and share with friends and family. Compliments of allnurses.com. http : **30;7898;TOOLONG? t=74... <p> Yes each state has its own Nurse Practice Act but the NCLEX does n't test you on laws in each individual state. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone goes to school in OH but tests in NY, it would n't be fair to them to get questions on their exam asking them about nursing laws in NY because they wo n't know. <p> The NCLEX is just a huge test bank of questions pertaining to nursing care, not nursing laws in each state. If you call Pearsonvue or your BON they 'll tell you the same thing. <p> How do you know its not different from state to state NCLEX exam? Each states has different guidelines for nurses right.....? I 'm not sure that 's why I 'm asking. <p> NCLEX is a national exam using national standards. While everyone does not get e exact same questions, the required knowledge base is the same. The basics are the same whether you take the test in NY or CA or TX or overseas in the Philippines. The nurse practice acts and facility policy and procedures may vary, but the basic nursing knowledge, skills, expectations, and responsibilities are the same across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take it anywhere. But I think the license that would be distributed to you after you pass will be from the state you are registered as a resident of. If you 're planning to practice in Texas, you need to get your paperwork rolling to transfer your resident status for Texas. Michigan is not part of the Nurse Liscensure Compact, so you will need to have all your personal info flipped over to Texas before you test - or your license will be for Michigan, which will only be valid in the state of Michigan. The NLC lets your license cross state lines without having to retest in a new state. <p> But before you do, poke around for Texas ' requirements to sit for the exam. Some states require more clinical hours in order to graduate from nursing school. A girl in my program ran into this problem and had to do this elaborate paper dance because our school could n't squeeze in the extra clinical hours her state required( she moved all her resident paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, passed, then transferred everything back to her home state. BUT, her state was part of the Compact Act, so it worked. Your state is not!). <p> It 's confusing, since everyone in America takes the national test by the same test maker... but that 's why I did n't major in political science. <p> Thank you, everyone. Ok, so its across the world same test, national. Now how is it each person had the same exam til CAT realizes our weak areas? <p> We do n't have the same exam but the same basic content. There have been many statistical studies as to which combinations of questions, when answered correctly, statistically( with a string confidence interval) indicate an individual meets the minimum basic knowledge competences to safely practice as an entry level nurse. Many of the studies are published on the NCSBN website( the organization that develops the test/test questions and determines the validity of each question). <p> Since its thru NCSBN, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay money since its from their published? Vs. kaplan Vs. HESI? Im just reviewing CDs from Exam Cram and Saundara, LaCharity, and HESI book.... all over... such a mess headache to cover all : -( <p> Since its thru NCSBN, would it be best to do their online review and pay money since its from their published? Vs. kaplan Vs. HESI? Im just reviewing CDs from Exam Cram and Saundara, LaCharity, and HESI book.... all over... such a mess headache to cover all : -( <p> I know a girl who graduated last year that highly recommended NCSBN. She said the questions were really similar to the ones she encountered on NCLEX. According
