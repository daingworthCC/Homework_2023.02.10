5076141 <p> We all know Tom Cruise has ruined Jack Reacher for fans of the Lee Child 's novels. Why was he cast when there are so many better choices out there? Not all of these guys would have been perfect in the role but any one of them would have been a far sight better than Tom Cruise. <p> Some of these choices have been added via this facebook page. Thank you to the pages creator for posting here so I could add more people to this list. <p> Jack Reacher is a former United States Army Military Police Major. He was born on a military base in Berlin in 1960. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he served 13 years in the Military Police, during which time he became part of a fictional military police unit, the 110th Special Investigations Unit, formed to handle exceptionally tough cases, especially those involving members of the United States Army Special Forces. Though he was demoted from Major to Captain in the prequel novel The Enemy, he regained the rank of Major by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military awards during his career, including the Silver Star, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier 's Medal, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Since leaving the Army, Reacher has been a drifter. He wanders throughout the United States because he felt he never got to know his own country, having spent his youth living overseas on military bases. He usually travels by hitchhiking or bus. As a drifter, the only possessions he carries are money, a foldable toothbrush and, after 9/11, an expired passport. He wears his clothing for 2 -- 3 days before discarding it, usually purchasing new clothing cheaply from chain outlets. He has no steady income and lives on savings in his bank account and part-time jobs. At various points during the series, his bank account is supplemented by taking money from his enemies.
