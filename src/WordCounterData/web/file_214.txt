5048041 <p> When the morning-stars - There can be little doubt that angelic beings are intended here, though some have thought that the stars literally are referred to, and that they seemed to unite in a chorus of praise when another world was added to their number. The Vulgate renders??????????????????? hote egene? the? nai astra - " when the stars were made : " the Chaldee, " the stars of the zephyr, " or " morning " -????????. The comparison of a prince, a monarch, or an angel, with a star, is not uncommon ; compare the notes at Isaiah 14. The expression " the morning-stars " is used on account of the beauty of the principal star which, at certain seasons of the year, leads on the morning. It is applied naturally to those angelic beings that are of distinguished glory and rank in heaven. That it refers to the angels, seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to correspond with the phrase " sons of God " in the other member of the verse. <p> Sang together - United in a grand chorus or concert of praise. It was usual to celebrate the laying of a cornerstone, or the completion of an edifice, by rejoicing ; see Zechariah 4:7 ; Ezra 3:10. <p> And all the sons of God - Angels - called the sons of God from their resemblance to him, or their being created by him. <p> Shouted for joy - That is, they joined in praise for so glorious a work as the creation of a new world. They saw that it was an event which was fitted to honor God. It was a new manifestation of his goodness and power ; it was an enlargement of his empire ; it was an exhibition of benevolence that claimed their gratitude. The expression in this verse is one of uncommon, perhaps of unequalled beauty. The time referred to is at the close of the creation of the earth, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and not of the stars. At that period, it is clear that other worlds had been made, and that there were holy beings then in existence who were of such a rank as appropriately to be called " morning-stars " and " sons of God. " It is a fair inference therefore, that the " whole " of the universe was not made at once, and that the earth is one of the last of the worlds which have been called into being. <p> No one can demonstrate that the work of creation may not now be going on in some remote part of the universe, nor that God may not yet form many more worlds to be the monuments of his wisdom and goodness, and to give occasion for augmented praise. Who can tell but that this process may be carried on forever, and that new worlds and systems may continue to start into being, and there be continually new displays of this inexhaustible goodness and wisdom of the Creator? When this world was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels. It was a beautiful world. All was pure, and lovely, and holy. Man was made like his God, and everything was full of love. Surveying the beautiful scene, as the world arose under the plastic hand of the Almighty - its hills, and vales, and trees, and flowers, and animals, there was occasion for songs and rejoicings in heaven. Could the angels have foreseen, as perhaps they did, what was to occur here, there was also occasion for songs of praise such as would exist in the creation of no other world. This was to be the world of redeeming love ; this the world where the Son of God was to become incarnate and die for sinners ; this the world where an immense host was to be redeemed to praise God in a song unknown to the angels - the song of redemption, in the sweet notes which shall ascend from the lips of those who shall have been ransomed from death by the great work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This must refer to some intelligent beings who existed before the creation of the visible heavens and earth : and it is supposed that this and the following clause refer to the same beings ; that by the sons of God, and the morning stars, the angelic host is meant ; as they are supposed to be first, though perhaps not chief, in the order of creation. For the latter clause the Chaldee has, " All the troops of angels. " Perhaps their creation may be the term heavens, Genesis 1:1 : " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. " These witnessed the progress of the creation ; and, when God had finished his work, celebrated his wisdom and power in the highest strains. <p> When the morning stars sang together,.... Either all the stars in a literal sense ; for though, strictly speaking, there is but one morning star, yet all may be called so, because early created in the morning of the world ; and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is observed by some, that the nearer the morning the brighter they shine : and these in their way sing the praises of God, and set forth the glory of his perfections, and occasion songs of praise in men ; see Psalm 148:3. Or figuratively, either angels, as most interpret them, comparable to stars for their glory, purity, and light, for their constancy, permanency, and numbers : or good men, particularly ministers of the word, and angels of the churches ; who are stars in Christ 's right hand, Revelation 1:20 ; but the principal morning star is Christ himself, Revelation 22:16 ; <p> and all the sons of God shouted for joy ; which are usually understood of angels also, so the Targum ; who are the sons of God, not by birth, as Christ, nor by adoption, as saints ; but by creation, as Adam, Luke 3:38. And because they bear some likeness to God, as holy spirits, and honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of sons of God, as distinct from the children of men, given to professors of religion, obtained before the times of Job ; see Genesis 6:2 ; and who might be said to sing together, and shout for joy, when they met for social worship ; see Job 1:6 ; and especially when any fresh discoveries were made to them of the Messiah, and salvation by him. Thus Abraham, one of these sons of God, saw Christ 's day and was glad, and shouted for joy, John 8:56. For these words are not necessarily to be restrained to the laying of the foundation and cornerstone of the earth, as our version directs ; though indeed the angels then might be present, being created as soon as the heavens were, and with the stars, as Capellus on this place observes ; and rejoiced, when the foundations of the earth were laid, on beholding such a display of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God therein ; and which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the laying of the foundation of any building of note ; see Ezra 3:10 ; for it may be repeated from Job 38:4 ; " where wast thou when the morning stars ", &c.; and so may refer to any rejoicing, whether of angels or men, before the times of Job, at which he was not present. <p> 38:7 Stars - The angels, who may well be called morning - stars, because of their excellent lustre and glory. Sons of God - The angels called the sons of God, because they had their whole being from him, and because they were made partakers of his Divine and glorious image. Shouted - Rejoiced in and blessed God for his works, whereby he intimates, that they neither did advise or any way assist him, nor dislike or censure any of his works, as Job had presumed to do. <p> 7. So at the founding of Zerubbabel 's temple( Ezr 3:10-13). So hereafter at the completion of the Church, the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its foundation( Lu 2:13, 14). <p> morning stars-especially beautiful. The creation morn is appropriately associated with these, it being the commencement of this world 's day. The stars are figuratively said to sing God 's praises, as in Ps 19:1 ; 148:3. They are symbols of the angels, bearing the same relation to our earth, as angels do to us. Therefore they answer to " sons of God, " or angels, in the parallel. See on 549Job 25:5. <p> 38:4-11 For the humbling of Job, God here shows him his ignorance, even concerning the earth and the sea. As we can not find fault with God 's work, so we need not fear concerning it. The works of his providence, as well as the work of creation, never can be broken ; and the work of redemption is no less firm, of which Christ himself is both the Foundation and the Corner-stone. The church stands as firm as the earth. <p> Genesis 1:16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. Job 1:6 One day the angels came to present
