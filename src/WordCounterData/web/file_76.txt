5034141 <p> The moment that hundreds of barrier island residents of Toms River have been waiting for will begin tomorrow. <p> The Township of Toms River announced residents ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on the barrier island will be allowed access for 60 minutes, with different communities assigned to different days of access. <p> Regardless, residents of such communities as Chadwick Beach, Silver Beach, Dover Beaches, Normandy Beach, Monterey Beach and Ocean Beach communities of Toms River will have to register at the Bellcrest Plaza on Fischer Boulevard and Cattus Island Boulevard. <p> Ortley Beach, the township says, has yet to have a plan for re-entry. The above communities, many of which are north of Ortley Beach, will have access Friday, Nov. 9 through Nov. 13. <p> Residents have clamored for any information for days, as neighboring communities of Lavallette, South Seaside Park, Seaside Heights and Seaside Park were granted earlier access and announced plans to visit their homes and businesses on the barrier island. <p> Perhaps one of the last towns to release its plans, Toms River Township posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov. 13 in the first phase of access. <p> The plan : <p> " We are beginning re-entry into the northern beach areas. Ortley Beach will be scheduled at a later date due to extensive road damage, " according to the township. <p> Friday November 9 : <p> Ocean Beach Unit 1 <p> Ocean Beach Shores <p> Sunset Manor Shores <p> Registration at 8:30 a.m. Bellcrest Plaza, Fischer Blvd. <p> Saturday November 10 : <p> Monterey Beach <p> Ocean Beach Unit 2 <p> Seacrest Beach <p> Registration at 8:30 a.m. Bellcrest Plaza, Fischer Blvd. <p> Sunday November 11 <p> Ocean Beach Unit 3 <p> Ocean Beach Peninsula( Bayside) <p> Registration at 8:30 a.m. Bellcrest Plaza, Fischer Blvd. <p> Monday November 12 <p> Chadwick Beach <p> Silver Beach <p> Chadwick Beach Island is not included. Residents there will be scheduled at a later date until bridge is inspected and found to be safe. Please do not respond on this date. <p> Registration at 8:30 a.m. Bellcrest Plaza, Fischer Blvd. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the tentative date for Chadwick Beach Island is November 13. <p> Registration at 8:30 a.m. Bellcrest Plaza, Fischer Blvd. <p> This access plan is called Phase One. In Phase One, residents will be transported to the barrier island on a Toms River Regional school bus, allowed 60 minutes to gather essential items that can fit in a suitcase on your lap, and then be escorted out. Residents are essentially entering their homes at their own risk, according to the announcement. <p> Here are the rules for Phase One : <p> In Phase One, there is limited entry to the island for full-time residents only. <p> Phase Two allows homeowners who are not permanent residents to inspect their property and collect essential personal items. <p> Phase Three allows any resident and contractors to winterize and assess damage. <p> As part of the plan announcement, Toms River Township released the following message : <p> " Toms River Township is dedicated to serve its citizens and will continue to work in conjunction with state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner. Thank you for your patience and understanding during these difficult times, " <p> The plan leaves out Ortley Beach community, a section of the township which Mayor Tom Kelaher referred to as " Ground Zero. " <p> " At this time the Toms River Police Department is implementing a plan which would enable residents of the Township to access their barrier island homes and businesses. Since the beginning of this event Toms River Township has actedin the best interest of the citizens of Toms River. Toms River Township is proud to report that we have had no loss of life or serious injury since the start of this disaster. We plan to keep it that way, and this is why we will continue tomove forward in an organized fashion regarding entry to this devastated area. We fully understand the frustrationour residents have endured with the inability to view their homes, and we are working diligently to accomplish this goal, " according to the township announcement. <p> Anger and frustration grew as residents begged and flooded town hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emails wondering when a plan would come. <p> Toms River Police Chief Michael Mastronardy said the number of calls were such that it became a drain on resources as emergency personnel were flooded with calls in the midst of several weather emergencies through today. <p> We have had a family house in Ortley Beach for more than 60 years. This is home, this is our family, this is generations of memories. We need closure. We need to see what is left of our personal property. We need to see our home. Yet, the local government wo n't let us in to see our homes before they are removed! We are hearing today that they are removing homes that have deemed beyond repair without notifying the homeowner. We are also hearing that they are removing cars, backyard sheds and other personal property. This is not right! What country are we living in? Is this legal? <p> We realize that this is a dangerous environment, but have the common decency to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they take their life away. It is bad enough that we have suffered this catastrophe, but do not kick us when we are down. As for full-time vs. part-time residents, we all pay the same taxes. We deserve to have equal rights when visiting our homes. Every day that goes by, the more damaged they will become. Toms River officials, you must reconsider your re-entry plan! <p> Frank, I agree with you. We know our houses and we know how to safely enter our home.. The comment made by Jersey Strong needs a reaction. 1. Change your name to Jersey Wimp. 2. The looters are already there. <p> Saw the streets... rode out the storm.... some streets are dangerous( Ocean, Bay Blvd., Rt 35 North)... some pretty good. Some areas... water damage for sure, but most houses still there... between A &P; through Lavalette between Rt. 35 S &; Bay Blvd. Not sure why these residents ca n't gain access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind... some of these full time residents are RENTERS... not even taxpayers), my shore house has stuff than my other property.... I was retiring there. And, Christie 's Executive Order does NOT dictate who can gain access. Who is coming up with this discriminatory definition? <p> There are many areas that are intact - other than water damage. These areas should be opened up to allow homeowners access to do damage control. Controlled access could still be in place so that some areas where damage is severe would be off limits. <p> I agree, this is total bull shit!!! block off the streets in ortley that are dangerous and let those of us who has homes on streets that are ok to get to. If they can travel through ortley on bay blvd to get to ocean beach, chadwick, normandy, lavalette. Than let us in too!!! <p> this need to be taken to court. They can not keep us away from our property, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of control government. We need to rise up against these out of control control freaks <p> They are trying to secure the area and make it safe. I understand we 're all adults but what happens when you get hurt and no one can get to you? Or you tie up someone who could be saving someone who needs it when your injury could have been prevented. <p> Sadly James there are n't enough people who can see this as you and I do. It has been 11 days. It is time to let us drive to our homes. Call the governors office and demand that he lift the emergency powers that he enacted and that are being used to deny us our constitutional rights. <p> I agree. Its time everyone band together and we hire a lawyer. Toms River Township needs to be held accountable for their bad decisions in not allowing homeowners access to their property to remove wet carpeting, etc, to prevent further damage. <p> I think that access prior to the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further disaster. I would simply ask that the homeowners wanting to get back into areas that are still deemed hazardous do so only after signing a waiver and a hold harmless agreement with the municipality. No option to sue the town/taxpayers in the event that you are injured or your house collapses on you. Without that, I think the powers that be are behaving prudently in what is a very litigious society. <p> totally agreed. this BS about only full time residents getting access should be contested. Part time owners pay the same tax rate do n't we? In fact we put less of a burden on the township than full timers( some renters) so much to say, but my blood pressure is rising... <p> We were finally allowed to go to our home on Dolphin ave yesterday, could n't take all of the things we wanted because we WERE ON A BUS. who gave toms river the power to tell me what part of my property i have to leave behind to get infested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action, has anyone done any research or spoke to an attorney yet? we would also be interested in joining a lawsuit.... by the time they let us drive in our stuff will no longer be salvageable!! <p> This is only for full time residents - you would need to prove residency via drivers license, etc. Basically there is no date yet for part time homeowners. We are no better off other than seeing the progress of the plan for the full-time residents. <p> We are not part time homeowners. Just because we have another residence does not make us part time. If that was the case we should only be paying part time taxes. For one thing, us so called part time homeowners do not use the township services all year long and we do n't use the school system. So actually, we are paying more taxes and we definitely should have more rights to our homes than a renter with a utility bill or a driver licenses. <p> @bluebeam... being I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 'm a " part time " but 90% of my " crap " is still there being I only rent a basement apt for my primary home what does that make me? it 's not my primary residence but the only home I own with all my belongings... everyone has different situations so its pretty unfair to categorize people that way... we all pay the same taxes mortgages insurance ect and just because its not where we stay all year does nt mean its not the only home we own... I would live there all year if I did nt get laid off every year from sept to may <p> By now unsafe areas can be blocked off. Residents should be able to drive in, gather our belongings and put debris out by the curb. This is getting to be totally ridiculous and unbelievable. This should be illegal keeping us from our property and the Governor should get involved with this ASAP. Where do they get off telling us we can going into our private homes for one( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase of personal items. Here 's what 's going to happen to our properties. Any property that was n't damaged from the storm, is going to be condemned for mold. Work that will NOT be able to be done by us, the home owner. The area will be declared a health hazard by the DEP. We will be locked out of our homes with no say for months, while they do what they want. You know thats whats coming. They said, next phase we will be able to come back and winterize our homes. They did n't say clean out. We need to plan a march over the bridge. <p> I agree. The houses on the west side of 35south are accessible and the roads are pretty clear in these areas. Mst of the damage was or is from water entering the houses. We all needto get to our houses to remove wet carpeting, furniture, etc. before the mold really sets in. The clock is ticking and the politicians need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are all still intact. It is easy to see what these areas are on the NOAA aerial images site. The aerial images show those areas that are clear and safe and those that are not. <p> Yes, agree with you. My sons home on West point Island was lucky. No water in the home, but shingles missing from roof. If that is not fixed immediately the home will have damage in it( water and mold). The road leading into WPI is safe and can be driven on. What he heck is the problem. We should organize a walk over the bridge. <p> 5 days scheduled and still no word on Ortley Beach access - the fact that the bus tour scenario in itself is a totally useless is a whole other issue. All the areas listed above need to pass through Ortley to get to their locations... so what is wrong with this picture...? SUGGESTION : Areas in each community with the least damage and most accessibility should be the starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FT residents and then all homeowners access to their properties. Once that is done the areas with more damage should be safer and in better shape due to continuing clean up/repair efforts. There have been people on the ground for days now - Emergency Mgmt teams should be able to determine the best places to start and actually give people enough time to get essential things done. Things need to move faster... use the tax dollars from barrier island homes to hire more people to coordinate this effort, if that is what is needed to get the job done! <p> Too true. NOTE : taxed-out-the-wazoo mentions that he saw areas with minimal damage before he left the island - they are the same areas that show little damage via satelitte pictures. Anyone with eyes can see this. On the ground emergency crews can confirm this. Local government needs to stop wasting time spewing rhetoric at us and start accomplishing something. <p> I agree. This is ridiculous, and it should be illegal. They should let us sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get to our houses, they will be damages further by the elements and mold. Count me in for action against big government. <p> I have the same issue... although im the one who 's lived there but my parents own it, but they are both sick with serious illnesses and only my hhusband 's dl has our ortley beach adress on it and the taxes are in my parents name... they really are making this a lot more difficult than it has to be... my father would be able to make the trip but ca n't help with anything so I would need my husband 's help, but they only allow 2... it 's all a mess... all I want to do is protect the property from further damage being I already know thatthere was only flood damage and one broken window and get my 5 year olds things out of the attic... from what I understand you have to provide proof your a full time resident at this point so it prob will be a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get power of attorney for them or something <p> Pete R - exactly. We do n't have flood insurance and I 'm sure we got water. The sooner we can address the better we will be. Who 's going to pay when the damage goes beyond normal repair???? There has got to be some type of action that we can take. Any lawyers out there????!!!! <p> I would be happy to contribute in hiring a lawyer. We need to all band together and do something. Toms River Township has no idea what they are doing to properties by prohibiting us from removing wet items from our homes, mold will certainly finish things off. <p> We really need a class action lawsuit started to wake them up... it has to name TR, OC, The State of NJ, and Christie... otherwise it will not be taken seriously. I have friends in Seaside Park reporting looting already. We must be able to get in and protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... I can not believe none are attorneys... I can not believe none have come forward to volunteer services or at least discounted services. <p> First thing to do is to file a Notice of Tort Claim outlining how you are being damaged by delays in allowing re-entry. this alerts( required notice) the twp that are going to sue and gives them a chance to take action to correct the situation.You shouldalert your insurance companies also, letting them know you are not allowed in, because most insurance polciys require that you mitigate your damages in a claim situation, but here you ca n't mitigate, because the twp wo n't let you. Urge your insurer to advocate on your behalf with the twp. Additionally, your property rights are being denied. <p> They 've sure had enough time to determine where there is no damage, but water damage. Full time, or part time, residents should be allowed one weekend to get down there, thrown out anything that will cause mold damage and be on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start repairs, just let us contain the damage that has already occurred... PLEASE????? I do n't want my house to look worse than Bin Laden 's beard as that untreated wetness becomes a hazardous mold situation. I said it before and I 'll say it again, if that part of Mantoloking could be filled in, wth ca n't twenty-two potholes, 8 or less feet deep, be filled so we can drive there. By the way, if Lavallette residents were allowed in, how did they get into their town? It sure was n't across the Mantoloking bridge. Was that roadway repaired fast enough to allow THEM in? I want the route that they took. More power to Lavallette for taking their residents needs into consideration! Now let the rest of us do what we have to. <p> Gail - Seaside residents and non-residents( PROPERTY OWNERS/TAXPAYERS) are driving their personal vehicles in.... TODAY. And, they are not being placed into " time out " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:00. Also, Mayor commented that construction is causing add'l problems. Does anyone know... is the debris being taken off the island to clear the highways or is it being placed/dumped into OB 's side streets like a trash disposal area? And, do these workers( all of them) have catastrophic disaster background... are they Township people or experts? Does anyone know? <p> It is disgusting. That woman who blathers on about her iPad is particularly obnoxious and particularly insensitive to the plight of Ortley homeowners who have lost so much. It 's outrageous that these imbeciles were able to tour our community and we are n't allowed to see our homes. <p> The fact is everyone that it is a hazard for you to be there. It is also nearly impossible to get to most homes on the island. I understand your pain and deeply sorry for your losses. But at this time there is no way for you to access them and they are doing everything they can for you to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a inlet at the end and ca n't get any where is not going to do much good. Please understand that they are doing everything they can so you can safely get to your homes. <p> Jim, route 35 is clear and there are buses and cars using it for travel both north and southbound travel. Granted, there are some areas that should be off limits due to safety reasons, but many areas are intact and safe especially on the bayside up near Normandy Shores and some areas of Silver Beach. Property owners in these areas should be allowed to return to their homes to do some damage control like removing wet carpeting to reduce mold damage and to winterize. Toms River Township is adding to property losses by prohibiting these owners to do what is necessary to salvage what they have left. <p> John, I 'll be at the march over the bridge on Nov. 11 at 10am with my 3 children ready to talk to any TV crews and radio stations that you can contact. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've had more then enough. Stop lying to me and my children. I want my children 's belongings out of MY HOUSE now. I call on all parents and grandparents of Ortley Beach to come to the march. All Toms River families please join us and show your support for our children who are being made to suffer. Shame on you, Mayor, for inflicting such trauma on the children of Ortley Beach! <p> Do n't know if you guys have not noticed but the whole state has been hit by this storm. Most of Ocean county is still without power. The man power is being spread out to cover the entire state not just your area. I see that you are in a place where you have power and internet service! My family is still in the dark with NO power, NO heat, NO phone and No home. So stop bitching you self centered self serving whining babies. March over and off the bridge and take pictures! Shame on you idiots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and my car to charge it... you may have no power but at least you get to be home.... look at how many people are living in shelters without a single belonging... I 'd take no power and a roof personally <p> Same old story Ortley Beach shafted. Lavallette allowed to pass thru our town cause their officials live in town. Mayor of Toms river lives across the bridge. So the residents of Ortley as usual are being subjected to third class citizen status. We will sign waivers etc. Let us get our belongings and begin the next phase rebuilding our homes. <p> JIM, thank you for your concern and sympathy. Spoken like a true politician And by the way. The inlet that you speak of, is that the same inlet that the buses, cars and trucks continue to drove over? CUBANO1, Sorry for your families lost and your frustation. But obviously you are assuming that everyone commenting here is sitting in that lap of luxury. And that I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can be with family members, shelters or working off the Internet on their phones. And for some, that might be their only posession. Many are suffering with losses, just like you and your family. So maybe you can stop with your self center ness, whining and name calling. Consider yourself lucky, as we all should that we 're alive and survivors. <p> LAVALETTE.... LAVALETTE.... LAVALETTE!!! Ortley Beach needs to seek aslyum with Lavalette... a gov't that cares about its residents. I recall a story within the past couple of years that several streets in Ortley that border Lavalette were able to become part of Lavalette because Toms River forgot about them during snow storms... they were stuck... did n't clean their streets, did n't get them out... gave them no attention... zero. Hey, sound familiar? ANyway, the Court ruled to allow them to become part of Lavalette Township. If I find the name of the case/news article, I 'll post it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie Ellis from Berkley Patch in Michigan. I just wanted to let you know that we are thinking of you and sending positive thoughts your way! Folks around here are donating to blood drives and sending supplies to the East Coast. We want to see you back on your feet as soon as possible after this terrible storm and ca n't imagine what you 've been through. <p> I submitted 2 aerial photos above of the Ortley &; Normandy area taken Fri. Nov. 2. The Ocean Air Support Squadron was asked by county OEM to take " after Sandy " photos of the areas of interest for local good guys. I posted the full 350+ photos on www.oceanblacksheep.com &gt;&gt; photo/video/slideshow link. A positive note to a sad event was that folks not allowed back were seeing their local area from 1,000ft. We started in Lacey, flew up to Pt. Pleasant, down the coast to Holegate. The flight gave most comfort that their home was standing. Please, please listen to local good guys and obey the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our eyes, the county overview that day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to you all. r/Ocean Blacksheep <p> I looked at the pictures and it 's unbelievable. I will be there on Tuesday for the first time. My heart is broken for everyone who has lost something or someone from this storm. I pray we will be back....... <p> We need access to our homes there is no difference full time or part time residents our bills and taxes are the same we are all in this together and do not let them devide us or we will lose our right we are home owners and we need to stop the mold damage and clean and secure our homes with out part time owner the full timers would not be able to live there part timers pay there share and use only a small amount of resources smarten up people we want to help our shelves we ca n't expect the official to do we must do it ourselves united we stand divided we fall <p> The plan of course does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pay taxes on those homes. I find this an interesting legal question as only Martial Law can define this kind of second class citizen status treatment by a local government. It certainly sounds like they are setting themselves up for mass chaos and legal problems making a really bad situation a lot worse. <p> I agree. Even though we do n't live there full time we are at our shore house on holidays and on weekends and we pay the same ridiculously high taxes that everyone else pays. Maybe because we are n't there all the time, our taxes should be adjusted downward. <p> I am also concerned about the damage that will occur if the township continues to delay our access to our homes. I hope the insurance companies with not begin to limit their coverage based on damage that was caused by the storm and the damage that was caused by mold being allowed to fester for weeks. I would not put it past insurance companies. I also agree with the previous post regarding tax payers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be illegal? <p> I live in Ortley full time. I want to be part of a coalition. I can not believe the people in these towns have accepted these terms without a fight. We are being treated unfairly and like we are in kindergarten. Take out what we can carry on our lap in the bus??? My winter clothes alone would n't fit on my lap! What about personal papers, photo albums, electronics, guns, valuables??? Why must we choose what will stay, and be destroyed further by the mold and moisture? This country was built on self reliancy, not by depending on local government. Why are we letting them do this to us and everything we worked so hard for??? Have we no backbone anymore? I will be part of any coalition to bring this to an end... I will be a front runner if need be, but we need to do something now... before it is too late. romulusmedusa@aol.com 201-655-4717 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice in your last 2 posts. Our taxes on the barrier island for the so called " Benny 's " is what supports Toms River tax base. I 'm sure most Benny 's did n't close up their homes for the winter yet. AND, there should be no difference between full and part time. <p> Barnegat Ray, I 'm in. I made a suggestion last night about a rally for Sunday morning. Are there any attorneys reading this that can help out. On a side note, LBI is going to start letting people in, except Hollgate. If their homes were n't damaged they will be able to occupy them. <p> We need to be very organized, and put pressure on the correct people... people who can actually make things happen. This talk of storming the bridge will not work... it is too narrow, and there are too many state and local police... they will block it in a minute, and people will get hurt or arrested. We need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks and stones... we need to have legal and political power behind us. <p> So what a lot of you pricks are saying is that because I am a renter I have no rights to my stuff? Well I have rented the same house on that island for 15 years and my whole life is in that house that is still standing. I want my stuff. <p> Joe, I believe if you read the description of the plan on the Toms River website, you can get in if you can prove your residency. I am assuming that since you have lived there for 15 years, your drivers license, bank statment, credit card bills, etc., have your address on it. You do n't need to be a homeowner, just a full time resident of one of the areas that is currently allowing people back in. This is pretty much the Toms River Secion of Normandy down through the Ocean Beaches. Just not Ortley Beach yet. I do n't see anywhere where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is - maybe the person who owns the home you rent is going and can help you out? <p> I would need a moving truck to get my stuff out. The plan is for 2 suit cases on stuff you can take out on a bus. I have proof of residency. I do n't know many people that can fit there life in two small suit cases. <p> So do your protest over the bridge, what would that accomplish? Jail time for everyone, tresspassing, making terrioristic threats? Ill be their with my video camera for this instant you tube classic of idiots being arrested. Listen to the police and governement they know what they are doing. Its for your own safety. <p> Assume they know what they 're doing!!!!? Not always! Government/police have made poor decisions in the past. That is why we need to be there... we just need people to show up... not actually go over the bridge. This is a peaceful protest to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are handling this!!! <p> Joe : No one said that you or any other renter with a 15 year history should not be able to get your belongings. As a 40 year homeowner in Ortley Beach. I feel that you have as much right to collect your belongings as I do. Hey Tommy : Whats wrong with a gathering with alerting news crews. No one said trespassing or making terrioristic threats. We can see the type of person you are are by your belittling comments. And your comment, " Listen to the police and governement they know what they are doing. " Good one!! <p> Joe sounds quite ignorant. He needs to think before commenting. We are only trying to unite citizens to be heard. Call news 12 if you have Cablevision and other tv stations to get the word out. Sunday @ 10am. <p> Check out the sites below. These pictures are from 8/9 days ago. What makes you think Ortley and the roads are n't 8/9 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was driving a bulldozer in Ortley. I said that there is no reason why we should be able to drive in, clean and grab our belongings. Block off areas that are not accessible. In Hurricane Hugo Florida residents were in there homes cleaning up the day after. <p> Thank God for these satalite photos! The local politicians do n't want you to know how little damage most of the island suffered. It is evidence that shows they are lying to us to keep us from driving onto the island. <p> I hope every protester gets thrown in jail along with all the looters. You no better then them because now your interfering with cleanup and become a hazard. So everyone put on your pick boy and girl pants on, and wait for orders like good people. <p> Toms River just updated their website with an important piece of information. It previously stated that everyone needed to be a resident. Now it says that only one needs to be a resident. So for those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to help them. One of them needs to go with you to show their identification what ever proof the township is requiring, but they can bring a non resident with them. Thank goodness. When you talk about the full time residents of the island, you are talking about a significant amount of older, retired people. <p> Lauren : I posted 2 aerial photos of our flight on Fri. 11/2 to this story, take a peek.. Look at the thread above to Mike Maino. I took an area just south of the Thunderbiird. Several burned lots. So sad. We flew from Point Pleasant to Holegate. Your first OMG was Mantoloking, Bay Head. Next was your area, next Ortley. I can forward to you photos you can zoom to your area of interest. We all share your loss. r/Mike Maino PAO, www.oceanblacksheep, com <p> I can understand wanting people to be safe when returning to the island, and to avoid looters getting onto it... but these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is THEIR property! 1st home or 2nd home, they paid for it and pay taxes on it... let them in! There are certainly a lot of people walking around in every stinkin ' video of the place put on YouTube! <p> seriously? just got a notification that my in laws from ss hts do nt have to pay their property taxes until 12/17 without penalities. They are in the worst hit area on the bay. omg, cant take this anymore. <p> Just watched NEW12 NJ helicopter over Ortley for 10 minutes. ALL ROADS to the beach are accessible 3/4 of the way up the streets. Ocean Ave is gone. Rt.35 North and South as well as middle blocks between the highway and west of Rt35S bayside is clear. <p> I can see my house in this picture. It 's looks ok. It 's interesting, however, the people walking down 3rd St in Ortley and all the cars parked on Rt 35. I thought it was too dangerous.... Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling that people are complaining that full time residents are being allowed first access to the island. What has happened to human decency? Did it occur to any of you complainers that these people have lost EVERYTHING???? They were evacuated from the island with probably just an over night bag, figuring that they would be back the next day. And now while we sit in our OTHER homes, they are homeless!!!!! I understand that we all pay taxes and should have the same rights, but lets have a little compassion here. Let the full time residents go back first and try to salvage some personal items. I happen to know a full time resident that would like to get back to retrieve her fathers ahses. We have all experienced loss from this tragedy and all of our homes are going to need repair in some way. Yes, the water damage will get worse by the day, and yes the mold is going to grow more and more. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your shore house, try to remember the people who do n't even know where they will be spending the holidays... or the next 6-8months for that matter! <p> I think the issue is not a lack of compassion for people who have lost everything but rather anger at the delay. I think if the day after the storm they had asked everyone to wait for full time residents to clean out first there would n't have been an outcry at all. But two weeks after the hurricane patience has run out and tempers are frayed. We should n't let them divide us - we want EVERYONE with a legitimate interest there to be able to get on the island. <p> I would whose house he is taking things from.... Further, interesting that he can give an interview from the streets of Ortley( with media trucks etc) but it 's too dangerous for us to go there. I keep trying to figure out the real reason why they wo n't let us in and I 'm not coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that I am pretty sure is going to piss a few people off, but I feel it should be mentioned... as a former " full time " resident of the Barrier Island, I have lived through several Nor Easters, been heavily flooded, and had to watch as my family has restored our homes, time and time again... that being said, I now live in Toms River, near the water and have seen complete loss and devastation on this side of the bridge... I COMPLETELY understand the frustration of " NOT BEING ALLOWED " back to your residences, but there were a lot of people on this side that have NO homes to return to as well, and some that will have to demolish their homes and rebuild entirely. You are complaining about being treated like " third class citizens " because you live on the island however there are people on the mainland that are suffering the same losses. From Toms River to Brick or even farther North such as the Shark River area or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUR LOCATION, and those of us who now reside on this side of the bridge are seeing how frustrated you are, but please know that some of our own neighbors can not return to their homes either. Looting, robberies, flooding, fires. PLEASE understand you are NOT the only victims and nobody other than maybe our lovely politicians would turn our backs on you and underestimate your stress and heartache. And no matter what the " satellite photos " may show from above, it 's what lies beneath can be deadly. <p> Having also lived on a barrier island for many years, and now live bayfront, I agree completely. This is with complete understanding of the frustration of not being able to return. It really is unsafe, with sinkholes, etc. My heart breaks for all who lost so much( and yes, I did too). You are not alone. I hope we can all get through this nightmare together, as a community. <p> I do n't mean this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland have to do with them not letting us on the island to see our homes in Ortley Beach. I wish no one had any damage but the one has nothing to do with the other. I 'm not mad at Toms River because of the damage but because they wo n't let me start the process of fixing it and Toms River is actively making it worse. <p> I was absolutely appalled today driving down Route 37 eastbound when at the Delta gas station on Route 37 and Clifton avenue I noticed a display of shirts set up for sale. The shirts had printed on them " I survived hurricane Sandy ". How inappropriate and tasteless this is. There were people whom lost their lives from this storm and communities that have been wiped out. Then I look at the westbound side of 37 and see 4 Central Regional busses that transported displaced homeowners to gather what they possibly could hold from what is left of their homes. These poor people had to see this display of shirts. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels the same why I do and do not patronize this gas station ever again. <p> Yes, people... IT IS DANGEROUS! I get it... if I could not get into my home I, too, would be furious! You should be taking this up with your Mayor, etc. Christie is only going by what THEY are relaying to him. It, in my opinion, is your local officials. I just returned from a " get-together " with a bunch of people dislocated from the barrier island and not once did I hear " me or I "... it was " how are your and your family doing ". Not all barrier Island people are ready to start a war and mad at the Gov, they just want answers from their local officials! Storm the bridge if you must... its your right. God Bless you all in this time of trial and tribulation. <p> Nancy, AGREED...... Here is a quote from Gov Christies ' speech. " Christie said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieve belongings and permit repopulation of the island for residents whose homes are safe and habitable. People should procede with caution as there is still a lot of work going on and dangerous conditions in many areas ". Work is continuing in LBI, while the residents return. They have not electric and must boil their water. And without signing waivers! Why is this not the same for Ortley and the surrounding area. They have been working in Ortley for 10 days. Rope off the worn, torn beach area and the part of Bay Blvd. Sink hole should be rope off by now. To familys who lost homes, on both sides of the bridge. To homes owners and renters. This is not about someone who has 1 house in TR or someone who has a house at the shore and 1 elsewhere. Some of us work very hard for what we have. This is about our Governor listening to OUR LOCAL POLITICIANS KEEPING US FROM OUR HOMES. FOR REASONS OF THEIR OWN. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one said storm the bridge, it was march. <p> I think we need a presence at the 37 bridge tomorrow at 10 am to show our disagreement with the ongoing denial to access our ortley properties after 2 weeks by the local and state levels of government. " Channel 7 on your side " has been notified by an ortley resident and hopefully more cameras will be present. Yes I am aware of safety hazards in the area. NOT every street is decimated. The A &; P parking lot is the command center they have been there for 2 weeks. I can see the a &; P from my house its not in a sink hole.Let us enter OUR fully taxed paid homes. Block off sink holes with barricades and limit access on those streets with police escort. I am not saying move back in, just let us in. RISE UP PEOPLE. I will be there at the bridge. Hope u will be there too. <p> How about a gathering at the bridge blockade. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop. Thats the place where when its our turn to catch the bus ride that drives you over the bridge. We can all wave our hands in the air when we 're on the top and yell " yippee " as we go over the water. Then we get dropped off and are told to hurry kids. Go pack your 1 suitcase from that house that you pay our town, Toms River, all your tax $$ to, out of all your possessions and hurry back. The next bus has to come over. If anyone, after almost 2 weeks feels this is right. I pray for you. <p> Unbelievable! Lavallette also is allowing only certain full time residents to collect belongings first. Based upon " safe " streets ". There is no mention of a schedule for when we will be able to go over to the island. We are waiting for the " mysterious " email to be invited on the bus. Such BS. My family has owned our home since 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town needs to allow OWNERS and residents back to their properties to start cleaning the mold problems! Hello Governor Christie! Are you listening? <p> be thankful you evacuated because carrying people on their backs in raging water was hard for the responders.... along with risking their lives... its hard i get it, but do nt make them have to come and get you all again when a road sinks or a house blows up <p> Kudos to all first responders always at the ready. Now its time for remediation of our homes. I helped gut a one story home last year with Irene. My cousin had 3 feet in her home, the stench was unbelievable and yes it was warmer then, but it was only 1 week later not weeks and WEEKS later. The entire 1st floor was ripped to the studs. Now in our homes the subfloors will also have to be ripped out bc they are buckle ing due to stagnant water still there. PLEASE LET US GET IN OUR HOMES GOV'NER. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of our tax paying homes! <p> I 'm looking for a single rider, male or female going to Chadwick Beach in the morning on the bus to retrieve your belongings. If you are going by yourself. I 've had a house in Ortley for the past 40 yrs. Its just night my turn on the bus yet. I would like to accompany you on this nightmare. I am a professional video and photographer. In addition to helping you carry out an extra suit case. I will also document this experience for us as well as giving you a copy, AT NO CHARGE. For yourself and your insurance company. You can contact me at jes352002@yahoo.com and I will get back to you ASAP. John <p> Here is mayors Kelaher 's email adress **30;8669;TOOLONG. Start pounding him with emails why and when is Ortley Beach getting in. With the warm days the mold is spreading faster and we need to do something before we all lose our homes. And where is his support, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy hit us. I have a feeling he does n't care about Ortley Beach, just cares about our tax dollars. Something has to happen now, it will be 2 weeks and still!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p> Hi Matt-Guess what... I have been informed by my sources about some backdoor politicking going on. My friends-not members went to the Ortley Beach VOTERS and Taxpayer Association for additional information. Again, not members of the association( which Association by the way has NO legal or governmental authority yet the Officials have specifically hand-picked them to be the ONLY contact with Ortley Beach INSTEAD OF THE TAXPAYERS THEMSELVES) as Ortley Beach is NOT a community of condos.. Anyway, as suspected.... this Association DOES NOT represent the Community... only its membership and refused to provided information provided to it through its special meetings with the TR Officials. There is an e-mail exchange which supports all of this. And, understand, TR Officials have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but TR continue to have " special " meeting with them as if they do. Btw - such discussions may be causing add'l delays. There are state AND federal funds here which DO NOT ALLOW FOR only certain taxpayers and certain " VOTERS " to be kept in the loop, only. Investigations will happen/how this is being handled. Contact US Senators and DC/FEMA people. This is not the normal.. hey/help me and I 'll paint you parking spots in front of your house or hey a Township job is opening-this is BIGGER-this is a FEDERAL DISASTER. So, the withholding info from ALL taxpayers and special meetings with some who happen to be VOTERS, too will surely be addressed in DC <p> Oh... and Matt... spread the word about contacting the Feds. Withholding information becuase you are not a member of an assn in disaster situation.. where A LOT of emergency disaster funds FED AND STATE are being used for clean-up, the special meetings themselves, Overtime, etc. May carry criminal charges, too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a membership fee and we 'll share our specially delivered info ; otherwise... too bad. <p> I fully understand everyones pain in being able to access your properties that you have worked hard for &; pay taxes on.. There is unforseen dangers still out there roads that are unsermined from storm drain pipes or utilities.. Chemicals from pooll &; auto which resort in a hazardous materials issue,, The authorities gave warning to evacuate some people listened by staying, some are injured or in body bags They are trying to prevent more, you take the issue in to your own hands you might be injured or expired,, I have my family My belongings can be replaced I shut everything off before i left my house. Took documents &; clothes &; drained the water based on the info that was received from weather reports &; local authorities <p> Yea for JOHNNY Done it........ Not everyone else had that opportunity! I guess Keyport and Union Beach does n't have major destruction, they do. Boats/ cars on bridges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil leaking in the waterways and in the communities. Businesses destroyed roads torn up and poles down. The whole town of Union Beach and parts of Keansburg have to be leveled. Was it the same destruction as Ortley, probably not as big. BUT MAJOR..... And the difference is, the day after the storm people were helping people. They are climbing thru the rubble cleaning up. The difference is, 2 HARD WORKING BLUE COLLAR TOWNS WORKING TOGETHER. THEY WERE N'T BLOCKED OFF FROM THEIR HOMES OR BROUGHT IN ON A BUS TWO WEEKS LATER. A week fine, 2 weeks is becoming a JOKE. Oh, and chemicals from pools, please. <p> Exactly Barbara, WTF? Contact the Gov 's office - OC po-po are under his domain, ultimately ; US congressman 's office( Fed funds being used, too, you know) and tell them that this these are the answers you are getting-none. Also reach out to the state police and emergency management, maybe they can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good response would have been helpful and directional ; like we do n't know but here you may want to try here, here or here. Instead, basically a governmental employee saying... duh, I do n't know, but thanks for the overtime! <p> Homes in Ortley Beach are being torn down without notification to homeowners! <p> Hello Barbara : I posted a comment last night, and it seems to have disappeared. We are hearing from neighbors that their cars have been removed and they can not locate them. They get the same answer as you, " We do n't know what happened. " As a matter of fact, homes deemed beyond repair are being torn down on their respective lots without any notice at all to homeowners. I know of two instances where the homeowner found out about the removal of their home by another source( not our government). They never go a chance to see what is salvageable or to get one last look. I am also aware that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again, no considerate communication to the homeowners. Toms River Officials : We all ask you to reconsider your clean up and re-entry plan before this story ends up on 60 Minutes! <p> I have unsuccessfully tried to get any information at all from the township of Toms River and our elected government about my home and community of Ortley Beach. All other Barrier Island towns have kept their citizen informed and up to date as to progress. My township has decided not to do that.... just an occasional blurb. Now to add insult to injury they have scheduled the council meeting for 3 pm as to put yet another obstacle in our path. They do n't want to see, hear or help us. I am disgusted by their treatment. I have seen photos taken that allow a visual from Rt. 35 S to the ocean..... streets from 6th to fielder are clear of debris. Today I maneuvered my way through and in between homes from CVS to Vision Beach. Although each and every house has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with State police from Maryland( extremely polite and sympathetic) they told me they were not allowed past the cement barriers either, they were only to guard them. I am starting to think they are hiding something. <p> me too Paula, very frustrating. no answers to my inquiries....... politicians want our votes, and we vote, but in times of need they not there. makes me sick to my stomach. ca n't tell u how many hrs. i spent of the phone this past 2 weeks making phone calls just to hear " i do nt know " / lost all in our t.r. home which my son rents, he and girlfriend here, daughter, boyfriend and granddaughter from ss hts homeless, took them in and poor old mom and pop who stuck it out to the end on bayside terrace and we found them at shelter. and no one in political office can contact me. i need to go back to work tomorrow, took past 8 days off........ this sucks a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there for us..... <p> thank you 60 year old resident, have n't heard inquires from mayor or police chief. oc police blotter responded they do nt know, good luck. wth? someone especially officials should know, but no one know. frustrating.... wnet there today, house is still standing, but how can they tear down houses and remove cars and not notify homeowners? unbelievable but thank you <p> if u hear any more, let me know campergirl307@cmcast.net i must go back to work tomrorrow. am housing 3 homeless families here, 2 from ss hts. and my son and girlfiriend who rent our t.r. home, we lost everything. unbelievabe, but trying to be strong, hard. <p> thanks taxed out, i just do nt have the energy anymore to make more phone calls. housing 3 homeless families here and what is is. they the politicians make me sick to my stomach......... sure if i call state police will get the same answwer " we do nt know "........ sucks. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families i took in...... will gov or work give me back that vacation time, all i had left for the year back? do nt think so........... yes, i am a public servant and this makes me so disgusted and sick to my stomach. must go back to work tomrrow, now i have no time left for the rest of the year. tried to go in one day and no power, they had 8 days of freezing and no powwer. sat there with hat, gloves, coat on........ and much to do here, so i was told had to use my time.......... which is fine, but now i just do nt know. <p> I 'm unclear as to why Ortley officials have not posted pictures of every home on their municipal website so that the homeowners can see for themselves the condition of the properties. Lavallette did post many of its properties and I think that is an enormous public service. I agree that if the property is accessible via roads, then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the biggest hit, their roads are extremely compromised( or non-existent in some instances), and I have a sense that some of the people posting here are wishful thinkers for what they believe they will find. The last thing needed there are hundreds of cars and contractors in an extraordinarily hazardous environment. <p> Thank you Toms River Police for your organization and help to retireve articles from my home. I know you have been working long shifts and many days straight but your help is immeasureable. Thank you. Thank you. <p> NYC starts a RAPID REPAIRS PROGRAM today. If they already applied to FEMA and have a number. They can start repairs with contractors without putting money out. The news was showing residents climbing through the rubble of their TOTALLY DEVASTATED Staten Island
