5102741 <h> 2 October 2012 <h> In the field <p> It 's a funny thing, being a farmer 's wife. Growing up as a Mainer, I did n't know any farmers, really. And now even when we 're back in Maine I feel like we might get a few head scratches when we tell strangers what my farmer does. He farms. Sure he does, they think. I think. <p> I 've gotten a little smarter about farming since coming to Iowa and you know, marrying a farmer. I now know what a combine is -- possibly the most brilliant piece of machinery ever. Seriously, it 's like a lawn mower, but instead of just cutting the grain at a very fast pace, it also strips it of it 's husk or bean pod or whatever, separates it from its cob/bean/whatever mates and deposits single kernals unharmed in the basket( which is probably not called a basket). I 'm sure if you asked nicely it would be happy to box the corn, gift wrap it and address it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also now used to the term " in the field ". Back in the day when someone would say that so-and-so is " in the field ", an image of a forlorn soul sitting out in a field, counting blades of grass would pop into my head. Now, I get it. So-and-so is out harvesting, plowing, planting, doing whatever it is one needs to do to cultivate the field to get it ready. I know that " grain " just refers to whatever crop is being grown out in the field -- corn and soy usually, but maybe alfafa or wheat or something else. <p> And now, I get the lifestyle too. When my farmer and I were first dating, he cautioned me pretty severely about the life I 'd be signing up for if I stayed with him. He warned me about the long days of harvest and planting, and warned me that that was and had to be the top priority when the time came. Some people work and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money based on the amount and quality of work they do basically at two key points in the year -- planting and cultivating in the spring, and harvesting in the fall. So it 's just concentrated. We all play our parts. My part is to run the clinic and take care of our boy. If I can take care of the house and keeping it clean and in one piece, that 's good too. His part is to be in the field, and take care of me and our boy whenever he can, and not complain about
