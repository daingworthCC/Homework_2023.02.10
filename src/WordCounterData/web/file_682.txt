From digging a hole to standing on top of someone 's thumb, we follow along as the dog learns a lot of words and concepts. We learn opposites : dark/light, day/night, here/there ; we learn colors ; we learn actions : wash your ears, scratch your head, blow your nose ; we learn silliness : kiss the goose, clean the zoo. <p> The pictures lend themselves well to pointing out objects and asking children questions.
