The aim of this study was to examine differences in emotion processing and regulation between people with and without Sjgren 's syndrome and correlations of emotion processing and regulation with mental well-being. <h> RESULTS : <p> Criteria for clinical alexithymia applied to 22% of the patients and 12% of the control participants ; patients had significantly more difficulty identifying feelings than control participants. No other significant differences in emotion processing and emotion regulation were found. In patients, the emotion processing styles affect intensity and alexithymia( 0.32&lt;r&lt;0.51) and the emotion regulation strategy suppression of emotions( r=0.13) significantly correlated with worse mental well-being, which is about similar to control participants. <h> CONCLUSIONS : <p> Processing and regulating emotions in patients with Sjgren 's syndrome does not deviate from normal with one exception : a relatively large number of patients is alexithymic. As in the general population, in patients with Sjgren 's syndrome the more intense and deficient processing and regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that, except for selected patients, processing and regulation of emotions is not a key therapeutic
