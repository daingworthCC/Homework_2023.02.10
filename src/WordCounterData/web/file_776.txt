5104841 <p> Next week marks the release of Call of Duty : Black Ops II. As you 're undoubtedly aware, Call of Duty is a powerhouse franchise, and deservedly so. Since the original CoD appeared almost a decade ago, the series has consistently delivered some of the most breathless, shocking, spectacular, cinematic action in gaming. So with Black Ops II imminent, now seems like a perfect opportunity to reflect on some of the memorable standout moments that have defined the series. <p> Let 's go SPOILERS lie beyond this point... <p> 10. Surfacing at New York Harbour Hunter Killer Modern Warfare 3 <p> The opening Modern Warfare 3 mission Black Tuesday is an all-guns blazing mad dash through New York 's devastated financial district that offers a fairly confined street level assessment of the Russian assault on NYC. The following Hunter Killer mission momentarily shifts down a gear, with an eerie underwater sortie through a flooded Brooklyn Battery tunnel, before surfacing in New York Harbour to a smoking skyline vista that leaves no doubt in the mind of the player that World War 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise Activision chose this mission to open the Microsoft press conference at E3 2011. <p> 9. De-Nazifying the woods The Forest Call of Duty 3 <p> A wonderfully paced, rising crescendo of a level. At first requiring a softly-softly snipey-snipey approach, with the relative peacefulness of the forest creating an edgy atmosphere, the player never quite knowing where the next Nazi 's going to spring from. Then it kicks things up a notch, with the battle intensifying as it moves between tight burrow-like trenches and wide-open spaces. Finally -- and a complete contrast to the cautious way the mission starts -- you 're given a mortar to play with, allowing you to merrily blow apart any of Hitler 's helmeted hobgoblins unfortunate enough to still be lurking in the forest. <p> This unnerving demonstration of the coldly efficient, detached nature of modern warfare as seen from the perspective of an anonymous thermal imaging TV operator aboard an AC-130 Spectre Gunship has a slightly surreal feel to it. It also has an irresistibly satisfying ' hey blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it. <p> 7. Beach landing The Battle of Pointe du Hoc Call of Duty 2 <p> Starts with a fellow soldier in the landing craft having a fear-induced puke. BLEEUURGH. This is quickly followed by the sound of bullets whizzing through the air. Then clouds of red mist as those bullets thud into flesh. Soldiers fall to the ground. Spray from a near-miss explosion obscures your view. Then the ramp is down and you 're running on to the beach. MORTAR BOOM. Down you go. Cue semi-deafened shell-shocked horror of war moment as you survey the scene around you. When you regain your senses the metaphorical implications of the vertical cliff face ahead of you become apparent. Your role to this point is one of spectator, but it 's still a breathless couple of minutes. <p> 6. Hijacked plane sequence Turbulence Modern Warfare 3 <p> And there we were thinking Modern Warfare 's breathless airplane-based bonus mission Mile High Club was pretty special. But then MW3 's Turbulence comes along and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crash landing that rips the aircraft fuselage in two. <p> 5. Planting the Russian flag at Reichstag Downfall Call of Duty : World at War <p> This ending has got it all. Explosions. Shouting. Smoke. Patriotism. Edge-of-the-seat tension. A surprise attack. Reznov wildly hacking a Nazi to death with a machete. A Russian flag flying as Berlin burns all around. Rousing music. Comradeship. Victory. Cheering. It 's a guaranteed vibrations down the vertebrae moment. <p> 4. Crossing the Volga River Stalingrad Call of Duty <p> The first Russian mission in the original Call of Duty was a good indication of what developer Infinity Ward was going to bring to the FPS table, namely shock factor. The boat trip across the Volga River is loud and chaotic, disorientating and terrifying. It 's a master-class in scene setting, creating an unusual sense of powerlessness in the player even before it eventually throws you into the fray without so much as a rifle. <p> 3. Betrayed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw this coming or not, the moment General Shepherd is revealed as one of the bad guys is thoroughly, tangibly, affectingly bleak. Not the first time Infinity Ward has landed us with a ' well done you survived the mission but hard luck we 're going to kill you anyway ' sucker punch, but it really does n't lessen the impact when it happens. The brutal, cold-hearted manner of the betrayal - Shepherd shoots Ghost and Roach point-blank and then sets light to their bodies before nonchalantly strolling away - propels the player crazy-eyed with vengeance into the game 's finale. <p> 2. Nuclear death Aftermath Call of Duty : Modern Warfare <p> One of the most talked about gaming moments probably ever and undoubtedly Infinity Ward at its cinematic finest, the dev expertly hitting all the right notes on the shock scale. The frantic preceding Shock and Awe mission ensures adrenal glands are at full pump, and its apparent successful conclusion is a fist-pumping moment. But the high is short-lived, cruelly blown apart with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that 's left is the unfathomable sinking feeling of futility as Sgt Jackson crawls from the downed chopper, inevitably to his death in the dirt of a scorched wasteland. A residual sense of gloom lingers with the player long after the screen has bleached to a sickening nuclear white. <p> Dressed like shrubbery for a **25;3079;TOOLONG dance deep in enemy territory, this is tense, terrifying, nerve-wracking and arguably *the* standout mission in the entire series, which is kind of funny as it 's so completely at odds with Call of Duty 's deafening, indefatigable **31;3106;TOOLONG signature style. As you weave unseen through enemy patrols, stopping occasionally to stealth snipe the occasional oblivious soldier, or lie prone in the grass as a tank rumbles by just feet away from your position, it 's genuine don't-forget-to-breath, edge-of-the-seat stuff. <p> Do your duty <p> That 's 10 of our best Call of Duty moments, but how about you fine citizens? We 're sure you have some indelible campaign memories you 'd like to share. After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us know in the comments. <p> Surprised to see no Black Ops moments in there, I think meeting JFK was particularly outstanding. The moment Brooklyn gets blown up by a artillery shell in Big Red One is also memorable ; here was a character we had come to love immensely and suddenly he 's wrenched from us in a very typical horrific fashion, so close to the end of the war as well. The nuke scene in MW1 is of course one of the most memorable and outstanding moments in any game really. <p> i cant wate for balck ops 2 it is will b the best gane of the year by far seruoisley its the sequals to the best game of all time and its just the most perfact multipleyer expereince u can get on vidoegames <p> Number One on this list is definitely the best moment in Call of Duty story-wise. The best moment in general in Call of Duty nowadays is kicking 10 year old asses and laughing at their pathetic insults. For some( if not most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure dark bliss... <p> Either the first mission or the last mission of MW1, for me. The first mission was balanced just so, frantic but never out of your control( until the end, when the tanker starts taking on water). And then the ending, that sense of hopelessness as you watch your squad die in front of you, and then relief when you get saved by Nikolai... Cod
