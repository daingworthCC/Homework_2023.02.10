5080441 <p> Now, more than ever, is the time for brands and companies to begin understanding how the chaotic and real-time world of Twitter can massively influence the ways in which consumers perceive them. <p> With so many different channels of communication and new social networks popping up every other day, it 's not difficult to see why brands tend to miss the mark when it comes to efficiently using individual marketing platforms for their intended purpose. For example, although Facebook is obviously a social networking tool, the majority of consumers who use Facebook are not quite the same as Twitter users when it comes to influencing the general public about a brand. <p> In a recent report from Exact Target( a global Software as a Service leader that connects customers with organizations through marketing), it 's been found that daily active Twitter users -- AKA, the consumers who actually reach out to or follow brands via Twitter -- are 3x more likely to amplify the influence of that brand than, say, a Facebook user would. <h> Who are Twitter users and why are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are active on Twitter daily : <p> 72% publish blog posts at least once a month <p> 70% comment on others ' blog posts <p> 61% write at least one product review a month <p> 61% comment on news sites <p> 56% write articles for third-party sites <p> 53% post videos online <p> 50% make contributions to wiki sites <p> 48% share deals found through coupon forums <p> In essence : What happens on Twitter does n't stay on Twitter. <p> Discussions that begin on the platform are more likely to appear elsewhere on the web than they are from any other network. Brands need to begin paying attention to their Twitter Followers as these consumers represent the most influential online users. Brands should be treating Twitter as an entirely different ecosystem of users, rather than directing brand messages on Twitter towards the majority of their consumers. <p> Active Twitter users count themselves as those who actually want to influence others. In fact, 73% of Twitter users have said that it is their goal on the platform to accumulate larger audiences, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> When it comes to identifying a group of consumers who are most likely to impact your brand 's online reputation, get to know your Twitter FOLLOWERS. These consumers are three times more likely than the average consumer to publish to a blog at least once per month( 53% compared to 18%), and the content might mention your brand. From submitting product reviews and commenting on news stories to participating in discussion forums and maintaining personal websites, FOLLOWERS represent the most influential online consumer. And while many passive Twitter users are decreasing their use of this channel, the highly-influential daily Twitter users( a.k.a. Megaphones -- download The Social Profile for more information) continue to increase their use. These consumers blog, comment, write online articles, and post to wikis more often than any other online consumer. <h> Twitter 's power to influence extends beyond the actual service. <p> Of course, Twitter is n't for everyone -- not every consumer( especially new adopters) can handle the overwhelming surge of incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't actually have to use Twitter to know what 's happening on Twitter. <p> Twitter 's extremely flexible API allows third parties to easily build applications on top of its infrastructure. Also, tweets can be read by absolutely anyone -- you do n't need to create an account to read a tweet. This means that while only a fraction of users are actually reading tweets on Twitter itself, the platform is still able to effectively double its reach. <p> Followers are n't the only ones listening to your brand on Twitter. <p> Search engines are listening as well. <p> Since search engines like Google or Bing are able to index your individual tweets, consumers will be able to find your previous updates during their own queries. What this means is what brands post from their Twitter account will effectively represent them for the remainder of Internet history and most likely will be found by those who are either watching for or stumbling onto them. <p> So how exactly should brands be interacting with their followers on Twitter? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right way to go about doing this. Twitter is a place for personality -- a place to help give brands a voice -- where users do n't expect every single company to interact with them in any specific way( except respectfully, of course). This provides ample opportunity for more creative ways to engage consumers. <p> For those brands who do need a bit of help, however, Exact Target recommends reading the case studies of other companies that have successfully used Twitter as a marketing device. <h> Twitter users appreciate the important stuff your brand has to say. <p> While some consumers might turn to Facebook for more in depth discussion, most agree that Twitter facilitates quick and concise communication due to its 140 character limit. The amazing thing about Twitter is that it forces us to shrink down all of the nonsense we want to say about ourselves and present it in a single shot. It 's like a resume -- you want to cut out the " fluff " and only offer the most relevant information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers understand that they are only getting the most important and critical information from brands or those they choose to follow on the platform. This, of course, means that brands need to find a way to embrace their voice on the service in a manner that quickly and effectively communicates the message they want to deliver. <p> The brevity of the platform is n't the only thing that keeps followers tuned into what brands want to say -- it 's also the fact that Twitter is both game, add-on, and advertisement free. By cutting out all of the distractions that we normally see while using any other channel, Twitter effectively narrows the focus for users only looking to find information. This means that whatever they are using Twitter for( whether it 's to receive news updates or interact with brands) gets their complete attention. <h> Twitter users are n't just following brands for news or product updates. <p> Consumers that seek out brands on Twitter are looking for perspectives from those companies that they wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brand or celebrity as well as their tendency to interact with followers often determines how successful that company or person will be in terms of making a meaningful impact on consumers. <p> For example, an angry consumer is more likely to Tweet about a failed experience with a company than they are to dial in their aggression as, oftentimes, they feel that the company will have more of a tendency to react( especially since the service is real-time). <p> Also due to the real-time nature of Twitter is the tendency for consumers to follow brands because they are looking for current promotions, special deals and coupons. Exact Target recommends engaging brand users with real time contests or giveaways, as Twitter followers tend to enjoy the entertaining aspect of these types of promotions. <h> The bottom line <p> Twitter, whether you like it or not, is a communication channel unique in and of itself. Understanding how to integrate the service into your marketing strategy can have a huge effect on the long term success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are aware of the differences between marketing to users on Twitter and reaching out to consumers on social networks. <p> Twitter users are blogger, vloggers, community members and active online participants in Internet culture. They are collaborators and contributors who need to be treated as such if a brand hopes to excel on Twitter 's unique channel. Take a moment to comprehend what exactly it is that your consumers want from you on the platform, and how to deliver that to them in a way that is uniquely capable of being amplified across all channels. <h> Discussion <p> I much prefer Twitter to other social network systems, in large part because of the real time interaction. I can attest that I will not follow a tweeter -- be it individual, celebrity or business -- if there 's little interaction. That 's not to say that I expect one-on-one conversations with everyone I follow. But if I look and that tweet stream is exclusively full of their own posts, with no responses to anyone else or re-tweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a glorified advertisement account and I have no interest in those( unless, of course, the account belongs to a news outlet ; I obviously do n't expect CNN to engage in personal banter). <p> Also, speaking for myself, I find Twitter a much more communal experience than Facebook. I find Facebook users rarely react to anything beyond " liking " content, whereas Twitter users are more likely to engage in discourse. The trending topics list also serves as a real time snapshot of popular subjects. Most of the time I 'm not interested in what they are, but every now and again it 's nice to see that a given topic is being heavily discussed and I can join in those discussions. There is no equivalent on Facebook to let users know what everyone else is talking about at a given time. From a business perspective, then, it 's much easier to get a feel for the aggregate taste of Twitter users. <p> For instance, I can tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most popular shows among Twitter users, because it trends frequently. Twitter users like hashtag games that involve substituting a specific word into movie, song or book titles. And Twitter users are much likelier to discuss a movie the night before it opens than after opening weekend. Optimus Prime was a trending topic the night before " Transformers : Dark of the Moon " opened, for instance. <p> So if I ran the Twitter account for an entertainment-related business, I would probably try to instigate some of those title substitution hashtag games perhaps weekly, and if I could somehow connect with a movie opening, I would do it the night before the movie opened. For instance, I might ask followers which actor in a movie about to open is their favorite. Then, I would re-tweet responses that mentioned movies that my company made. The average person is oblivious to which movies were made by which studio. <p> Say I ran Sony 's Twitter account. The night before Universal 's " Tinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I might ask, " What 's your favorite Gary Oldman movie? " and then I would re-tweet the first enthusiastic response that says, " The Fifth Element " because that 's a Sony movie. Now all of a sudden, the night before " Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy " opens, I 've got people thinking about " The Fifth Element. " If I ran Warner Bros. ' s Twitter account, I 'd jump on responses that mention the Batman movies. <p> This alone catches the pre-release wave, engages the followers and reminds people of the business 's product. Maybe it 's bad form to exploit your competition 's release like that, but if I did n't have a movie of my own to push that week, I would n't hesitate to try to jump in on the action. <p> http : **28;1635;TOOLONG Travis McClain <p> I much prefer Twitter to other social network systems, in large part because of the real time interaction.

As a result, brands must engage and talk back whenever possible. <p> Many brands make the mistake in thinking that social media is only a way to push their messages out to people( i.e. a monologue). However, social is about a dialogue in which consumers expect to happen instantly. <p> Twitter : @eyebrand <p> http : **25;1746;TOOLONG eyeBrand <p> Now that consumers use Twitter and Facebook to interact with brands in real-time with complaints, issues or questions, brands must treat tweets and posts as direct, yet very public converstations with them.

The real-time factor is a major factor in that. But Facebook is in real time too, but because pretty much most FB personal pages are often closed to non-friends, Twitter definitely takes the cake when it comes to the value that it provides businesses. <p> kinga potrzebowski <p> Excellent post!
