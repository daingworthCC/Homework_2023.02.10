The first set of three lambs was born early on the morning of Feb. 23, Quigg said, and a second trio arrived Feb. 24. <p> Quigg said the owner of the lambs, local farmer Joann Zimmerman, had several ewes that were pregnant and brought what was believed to be the pair closest to giving birth. <p> The students ' first order of business was learning how to care for the newborn lambs. The class quickly learned a hard lesson in life when a ewe accidentally smothered one of the newborns during the weekend. <p> " The animal crew have special responsibilities to care for the sheep, " Quigg said. <p> She said her 14-student class learned the basics of taking TPR -- temperature, pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quigg said the husbandry lesson also crossed over to the life skills class when 10 students came for a visit. <p> " We also had a student do a video segment on the project for our school 's morning announcements, " Quigg said. <p> The lesson played an important part in the academics of two of her sophomore students. <p> " This is part of a graduation project for both Emily Pfeiffer and Laura Pastrana, " Quigg said. " Our students can choose to complete their graduation projects any time they are at the high school, so these girls have decided to get them out of the way early. " <p> Before the ag lesson could even begin, Pastrana and Pfeiffer received a civics lesson. <p> Quigg explained that the zoning of the school grounds prohibits the raising of livestock without a special exception. <p> " We had to go to the Ephrata Borough safety committee and explain what we wanted to do, " Pastrana said. <p> Pastrana said that once she explained the educational goals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission for the sheep project to proceed. <p> Pfeiffer said the project was a learning experience. She said she learned to give the animals shots, practiced with different restraints and docked tails. <p> The process of docking a tail usually involves wrapping a band around the base of the tail to cut off the blood supply. After a few days, the tail dies and falls off. <p> Quigg said that although docking has a cosmetic effect, the process also minimizes disease and infection. <p> " This is a hands-on lesson, " she said. <p> In addition to the lambs, Quigg 's animal sciences class has raised piglets and broiler chickens in the past. <p> Quigg 's students clearly bonded with the lambs, giving them names including Duke, Norman and Billy Goat. <p> On Friday, just prior to the sheep shipping back to their home farm, the class observed one final lesson -- a shearing demonstration. <p> The shearing was necessary because the two ewes became uncomfortable with the unseasonably warm weather @ @ @
