Do n't access anything in the table of contents until the whole thing is loaded. --Jolo <h> Abstract <p> Have you ever wanted to talk with other computer users in other parts of the world? Well guess what? You can! The program is called IRC,( Internet Relay Chat), and it is networked over much of North America, Asia Europe, and Oceania. This program is a substitute for ' talk ', and many other multiple talk programs you might have read about. When you are talking on IRC, everything you type will instantly be transmitted around the world to other users that might be watching their terminals at the time. They can then type something and respond to your messages, and vice versa. I should warn you that the program can be very addictive once you begin to make friends and contacts on IRC, especially when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discussion on IRC are varied, just like the topics of Usenet newsgroups are varied. Technical and political discussions are popular, especially when world events are in progress. IRC is also a way to expand your horizons, as people from many countries and cultures are on 24 hours a day. Most conversations are in English, but there are always channels in German, Japanese, French, Finnish, and occasionally other languages. <p> IRC gained international fame during the late Persian Gulf War, when updates from around the world came across the wire, and most people on IRC gathered on a single channel to hear these reports. <h> 1. Getting Started <h> 1.1 Clients and Servers <p> IRC( original code was written by Jarkko Oikarinen) is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network. It allows people all over the internet to talk to one another in real-time. It is a functional replacement and improvement to ' talk ' ; ' talk ' is an old, primitive, atrocious, minimalist sort of keyboard/screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( blah!). IRC does everything ' talk ' does, but with better protocol, allowing more than 2 users to talk at once, with access across the aggregate Internet, and providing a whole raft of other useful features. <p> There are two ways to enter IRC from a Unix system. If you are using the emacs( editor from Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation) lisp client, you just have to type " M-x irc ",( if this does n't work you may need to load the client into your emacs session). If you are using the C client,( easier for beginners), then you usually type " irc ". Non-Unix boxes have special clients, each of which has to be configured using a special procedure. Check the manual or help screen for more information. <p> If you wish to be known by a nickname which is not your login name, type " irc nickname " instead. Each IRC user,( " client ") @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either by nickname or by the channel that they or you are on( more information about channels later on). <p> The most important thing to remember about IRC is that you have to be willing to explore and learn to use it. Take your time, try not to get flustered, enjoy yourself, and you will soon be making new friends all over the world! <p> IRC is based on a client-server model. Clients are programs that connect to a server, a server is a program that transports data,( messages), from a user client to another. There are clients running on many different systems,( Unix, emacs, VMS, MSDOS, VM...), that allow you to connect to an IRC server. The client which will be spoken of here is the most widespread : ircII,( originally designed by Michael Sandrof). Other clients are similar, and often accept ircII commands. <h> 1.2 How to behave on IRC <p> The most widely understood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRC is used in many different countries, English is by no means the only language. If you want to speak some other language than English,( for example with your friends), go to a separate channel and set the topic to indicate that. On the other hand, you should check the topic before you move to a channel to see if there are any restrictions about language. On a non-restricted channel, please speak a language everybody can understand. If you want to do otherwise, change channels and set the topic accordingly. <p> It 's not necessary to greet everybody on a channel personally. Usually one " Hello! " or equivalent is enough. And do n't expect everybody to greet you back. On a channel with 20 people that would mean one screenful of hellos. It 's sensible not to greet, in order not to be rude to the rest of the channel. If you must say hello to somebody you know, do it with a private message. The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client facilities,( ircII " ON " command, for instance), to automatically say hello or goodbye to people is extremely poor etiquette. Nobody wants to receive auto-greets. They are not only obviously automatic, but even if you think you are polite, you are actually sounding insincere and also interfering with the personal environment of the recipient. If somebody wants to be auto-greeted on joining a channel, he will auto-greet himself. <p> Remember, people on IRC form their opinions about you only by your actions, writings and comments, so think before you type. If you use offensive words, you 'll be frowned upon. Do not " dump " to a channel or user,( send large amounts of unwanted information). This is likely to get you kicked off the channel or killed off from IRC. Dumping causes network " burps ", connections going down because servers can not handle the large amount of traffic anymore. Other prohibited actions include : <p> Harassing another user. Harassment is defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. <h> 1.3 Privacy on IRC <p> You should always keep in mind that messages you send to someone over IRC are passed along all the servers between you and and the person you are writing to. When you 're sending a letter to someone, any postman on the way could open it and read its contents. <p> Well, it 's the same on the network. Any IRC-Admin could compile their server in " debug " mode and log whatever messages are transmitted through his node,( it has already been done), so a good rule of thumb is not to trust the servers. <p> IRC IS NOT A SECURE WAY OF COMMUNICATION! <p> How to establish direct communications between clients will be explained later,( see DCC CHAT in section 2.5). This should be used when you would n't want anybody else on IRC to intercept your private messages. <h> 1.4 First Steps <p> Note : ircII, the client most people are using, has most of this information online. If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To escape from HELP mode, keep pressing until your edit line,( the line at the bottom of the screen), is empty. Most of the information in this file can be found typing these commands : " /HELP INTRO " or " /HELP NEWUSER ". <p> All ircII commands begin with a " /irchelp/ " character. <p> The slash is the default command character. Commands are not case sensitive, and can be abbreviated to their first letters : " /SI " and " /sign " stand for /SIGNOFF and will both end your IRC session,( more in section 2.1). <p> Anything that does not begin with " /irchelp/ " is assumed to be a message to someone and will be sent to your current channel, or to a person you are QUERYing,( the QUERY command will be detailed later on, maybe in section 2.2). <p> If you are not sure about the spelling of an ircII command, type the prefix of that command, and press the ESCape key twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliases that start with that prefix. Do n't forget the " /irchelp/ " in front of the command though. <h> 1.5 Screen and Keyboard activity <p> IRC is a full-screen utility. It takes over the screen, with the bulk of activity happening in the top( N-2) lines, a status line,( vaguely emacs-like), on the next to last line, and your input being entered on the last line. When typing commands at ircII, you have a minimalist line-editing facility in an emacs style. <p> Table 1 : Editing keys ---------------------- Key Effects P recalls previous command line N recalls next command line F moves forward one character B moves backward one character A moves the cursor to the beginning of the line E moves the cursor to the end of the line D deletes the character under the cursor K kills from the cursor to the end Y reinserts the last stretch of killed text U clears the whole line L redraws the screen <p> The! command is used to recall previous commands in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that when it is used, it leaves the matching history entry in the input line for re-editing. You can specify a history entry either by its number in the history list, or by a match with a given wildcard expression. For instance, " /! 10 " will put entry 10 in the history list into the input line. " /! /MSG " will search the history for a line beginning with a /MSG,( a " * " is implied at the end). <p> /! &lt;history number&gt;&lt;history match&gt; <p> Recalls previous commands for re-editing. <p> /HISTORY &lt;number&gt; <p> Displays the command history on the screen. You can specify the number of history entries you wish to view as well. <p> Almost everything happens in the upper bulk of the screen. This includes both messages from other users, as well as the output of the control commands. Normal messages from other users appear with the originating nickname in &lt;angle brackets&gt;. Private messages arrive with the originating nickname in *asterisks*. Messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whereas messages you send privately to another user appear with " -&gt; *nickname* ". Other output( invitations from other users to join channels, and so forth), appears interspersed with other activity on the screen. <p> Displays the contents of the lastlog. This is a list of the most recent messages that have appeared on the screen, useful if you inadvertantly miss messages. If no arguments are given, the entire lastlog is displayed. If the first argument is a number, it determines how many log entries to show. Otherwise it is searched for in every lastlog entry. The second argument determines how many lines back to start display from. <p> /LASTLOG &gt; Public message I send to all in the channel &lt;some1else&gt; Public message from some1else *some1else* Private message sent to me by some1else -&gt; *some1else* Private message I send to some1else <p> Finally, if your screen gets garbage from a ' talk ', ' write ', ' wall ' or any other form of primitive communication( smirk), hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone who wants to talk to you sees this name - also, at the moment, nicknames are limited to 9 characters max. Your nickname will be the same as your login name by default. You can also set an environment variable, IRCNICK, the value of which will be used instead. Nickname clashes are not allowed ; this is enforced by the servers. If your intended nickname clashes with someone else 's as you enter IRC, you will not be able to enter until you change it to something else. <p> /NICK Nappy *** Nap is now known as Nappy <p> /QUIT &lt;reason&gt; <p> Exits your IRC session. You can also use BYE, SIGNOFF and EXIT. If a reason is supplied, it is displayed to other people on your channels. <p> /QUIT Lunch Time! <p> /HELP &lt;command&gt; <p> Shows help on the given command. Note : This is not installed for all clients, which can be kind of annoying. <p> /HELP HELP Usage : HELP command Shows help on the given command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion. That means that certain help topics have sub-topics under them. boring stuff deleted <p> Very often, an unsuccessful call to WHOIS will lead you to try WHOWAS. That 's why ircII allows you to " /SET AUTOWHOWAS ON " ; that way, a " *** &lt;nickname&gt; : No such nickname " message will auto-magically generate a " /WHOWAS &lt;nickname&gt; ". Try typing " /HELP SET AUTOWHOWAS " for more information on this topic. <p> /AWAY &lt;away message&gt; <p> Leave a message explaining that you are not currently paying attention to IRC. Whenever someone sends you a MSG or does a WHOIS on you, they automatically see whatever message you set. Using AWAY with no parameters marks you as no longer being away. <p> /AWAY Gone to get a cup of coffee. *** You have been marked as being away /AWAY *** You are no longer marked as being away <p> You can use the MSG command,( usually " M " is an alias for it), to send someone a message that only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private message to specified nickname. <p> /MSG Nap This message is for Nap only. -&gt; *Nap* This message is for Nap only. On my screen will appear : *YourNick* This message is for Nap only. <p> If you want to send a private message to more than one person, you can specify a list of nicknames separated by commas,( no spaces). <p> /MSG Nap, Sorg This message for both Nap and Sorg. -&gt; *Nap* This message for both Nap and Sorg. -&gt; *Sorg* This message for both Nap and Sorg. <p> Two special case nicknames are defined. If the nickname is ", "( a comma), the message is sent to the last person who sent you a MSG. If the nickname is ". "( a period), the message is sent to the last person to whom you sent a message. <p> You can have a private conversation by only using /MSG. However, typing " /MSG &lt;nick&gt; &lt;text&gt; " or " /MSG. &lt;text&gt; " gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy. <p> /QUERY **31;6356;TOOLONG <p> Starts a private conversation with &lt;nickname&gt;. <p> All text you type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to the supplied nickname in the form of MSGs. To cancel a private conversation, use QUERY with no arguments. <p> There is also another command to send messages, called NOTICE. Unlike MSGs, NOTICEs are surrounded by ' - ' when printed, and no automated responses,( such as generated by IGNORE or an automaton), will be sent in reply. Services,( robots), on IRC often use this form of interaction. <p> Eventually, you may wish some day not to see messages from a specific user on your screen. This may happen when someone is dumping large amounts of garbage, or if someone is harassing you. The proper response to such a behavior is to IGNORE that person. IGNORE is a very powerful command, and can be used in many ways. However the basic usage of this tool is the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the given people from your screen. IGNORE can be set by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname format. Wildcards may be used in all formats. Output that can be ignored includes MSGs, NOTICEs, PUBLIC messages, INVITEs, ALL or NONE. Preceding a type with a " - " indicates removal of ignoring of that type of message. <h> 2.3 Channels and Public Conversations <p> On IRC, there are a lot of places where you can " hang out " ; those places are called ' channels ',( most of the information in this section can also be obtained by issuing " /HELP CHANNEL "). You can compare conversations on a channel to a conversation among a group of people : you see/hear everything that is said, and you can reply to anything that 's said. What you type is received by everyone who 's willing to listen - and everyone who is late will not hear what was said before, unless repeated by one of the ones who were there.( Who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRC have names : a " # " sign followed by some kind of text-string, like " #C++ " or " #Asians " or " #EU-Opers ". Usually, the name of the channel will indicate the type of conversation that 's going on in there. Do n't count on it, though. <p> Table 6 : Channel commands **26;6424;TOOLONG Keyword Action LIST lists channels, number of users, topic NAMES shows the nicknames of the users on each channel JOIN sets your current channel,( same as CHANNEL) WHO gives a listing of users INVITE sends an invitation to another user LEAVE leaves a channel,( same as PART) KICK gets rid of someone on a channel TOPIC changes the topic of the channel ME sends anything about you to a channel or QUERY DESCRIBE sends anything about you to a person or channel <p> Every channel has certain characteristics, called channel modes. These will also be explained below. Remember the NAMES and LIST commands ; they will show you the names of the existing channels. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels ", number of users, and topic. The displayed list may be quite long, so you can limit it using flags. " /LIST -MIN n " for instance removes channels with less than ' n ' users of the output. <p> The CHANNEL command has the same effects. Note that if no parameters are given, your current channel is displayed. <p> Upon entering a channel, you are given useful details about it : list of users talking in that channel, topic... Joining a channel does not cause you to leave your previous channel unless NOVICE is set to ON. See " /HELP SET NOVICE ". <p> Once in a channel, you may wish to get a detailed list of the people IRCing inside. That 's where the WHO command comes in handy : <p> /WHO **27;6452;TOOLONG expression&gt; <p> Gives a listing of users. " /WHO * " for the list of users in your current channel. <p> The first field is the current channel, then nickname, status, real name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty comment you can set yourself with the environment variable IRCNAME,( this will be detailed in section 2.8). Status indicates if a user is " H " ere or " G " one,( see AWAY), if IRCop( " * "), and/or a channel operator( " @ "). <p> It is also possible, when you are already on a channel, to ask someone to join your channel. The command is called INVITE. <p> /INVITE &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;channel&gt; <p> Invites another user to a channel. If no channel is specified, your current channel is used. <p> /INVITE Nap *** Inviting Nap to channel #TwilightZone <p> If you receive an INVITE message, you can type " /JOIN -INVITE " to join the channel to which you were last invited, or simply " /JOIN &lt;channel&gt; ". <p> To leave a channel, just issue a LEAVE command,( PART has the same effects) : <p> /LEAVE &lt;channel&gt; <p> Leave a channel. <p> /LEAVE #TwilightZone *** Nap has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a way to invite someone on a channel, there 's also the possibility to KICK someone out of it, for example if this person is behaving like a jerk, annoying people or flooding the channel with unwanted information : <p> /KICK &lt;channel&gt; &lt;nickname&gt; <p> Kicks named user off a given channel. Only ' channel operators ' are privileged to use this command. <p> /KICK #TwilightZone Target *** Target has been kicked off channel #TwilightZone by Nap <p> Channels have topics, that indicate the current topic of conversation. You can change this topic on a channel with the TOPIC command. <p> /TOPIC &lt;channel&gt; &lt;topic for channel&gt; <p> Changes the topic for the channel. <p> /TOPIC The silent channel. *** Nap has changed the topic on channel #EU-Opers to The silent channel. <p> At times, you may want to send a description of what you are doing or how you are feeling or just anything concerning you to the current channel or query. It is absolutely good style not to forget the period at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel or query about what you are doing. You can also use your own nickname as command, i.e. you can type the line with a leading slash. <p> /ME opens up the fridge. * Nap opens up the fridge. /Nap reaches out for the orange juice. * Nap reaches out for the orange juice. <p> The same goal can be achieved towards a specific nickname using : /DESCRIBE **31;6481;TOOLONG &lt;action description&gt; <p> Sends anything concerning you to the &lt;nickname&gt; or &lt;channel&gt; you pass as first argument. <p>( Note : The look of the result depends on each client version, and might not be exactly the same as in the examples shown here.) <p> These commands make use of CTCP, a client-to-client protocol crafted to perform specific actions, but not understood by all clients,( more about CTCP in section 2.5). If you get an error message, your description may not have arrived properly. <h> 2.4 Channel and User Modes <p> Channels can have additional constraints, which can be set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section can also be obtained by issuing " /HELP MODE "). To understand this, recall that the first person to JOIN a channel effectively creates it and is initially " in charge " of the channel,( " Channel Operator " or " chanop "). S/he can subsequently add those constraints, make other people chanops at leisure. <p> Public is the default mode for a channel. When someone is on a public channel, he can be seen by all other users,( if his own user mode permits this). Anyone can notice users on a public channel and join such a conversation. <p> Private means that, although anyone can see members of such a channel, you ca n't tell what channel they are on unless you are already on that channel with them. They just appear as " Prv : * " in LIST or NAMES. Since the number of potential channels is in the billions, this is quite some security - all you give away is the acknowledgement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret channel, someone who is not on the same channel ca n't even see that you are there. Your name does not show up in a LIST of active users. The only indication of your presence is that, when entering IRC, all new users are told that there are " NNNNN users on XXX servers ". If someone checks on all users and finds less than NNNNN of them, he knows that other people are hiding on secret channels. But a secret channel user still can not be found except by brute-force checking through all channels, a hopeless proposition in the face of the huge number of possible channel names. Security through obscurity finally means something. <p> /MODE **31;6514;TOOLONG +-&lt;modechars&gt; &lt;parameters&gt; <p> Allows channel operators to change channel mode, or any user to change their personal mode,( do n't use this co mmand too often, it floods the net with worthless information). <p> A + or - sign determines whether the mode should be added or deleted. Try typing " /HELP MODE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( only chanops can talk), secret, private, with a limited number of users, anonymous, invite-only, topic-limited, with a list of banned users. <p> The MODE command also allows you to modify your personal parameters, your " user mode ". You can check your usermode with the command " /MODE &lt;YourNick&gt; " or sometimes " /UMODE ". Note that user mode +i may be the default on some servers, in order to protect privacy of users. This should not be seen as a problem, since any user can change his/her personal mode whatever defaults a server may set. <h> 2.5 Client to Client Protocol <p> /CTCP &lt;argument&gt; <p> Allows you to perform certain client specific actions on the network. <p> /CTCP Nap VERSION *** CTCP VERSION reply from Nap : ircII 2.2 *IX : ircII 2.2, SL0 The one you thought you 'd never see. This can be used to get information about how long a person has been idle : /CTCP Nap FINGER *** CTCP FINGER reply from Nap : PIOCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Idle 0 seconds <p> There are many other CTCP commands, and new ones are introduced all the time. There is a mechanism for you to find out what you can use : CTCP CLIENTINFO. To find out about your own client services, execute a CLIENTINFO on yourself. <p> If you are interested in this powerful CTCP mechanism, have a look in the various ircII help files. " /HELP CTCP " might tell you more. However the client-to-client protocol has a very powerful feature : Allowing two people to exchange files. <p> To send small text files, electronic mail is probably the best solution,( do n't rely on the user@host given by the WHOIS command to send mail. However, ircII provides you a way to establish Direct Client Connections( " DCC ") to perform functions like sending and receiving files. <p> If NickA wants to send a file to NickB, then NickA should type : " /DCC SEND NickB filename ". On NickB 's screen will appear : " *** DCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he,( NickB), wants to get the file, he just needs to type : " /DCC GET NickA filename " <p> A few seconds later *** DCC GET connection with NickA established *** DCC GET filename connection to NickA completed will inform both users that data transfer has been successfully completed. <p> Here 's a quick overview of the subject : /DCC &lt;function&gt; &lt;arguments&gt; <p> Handles direct connections to remote clients. The behaviour of DCC is determined by the specified. <p> /DCC SEND &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; <p> Initiates a file transfer by direct client connection. <p> /DCC GET &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; <p> Accepts a file transfer by direct client connection. The sender must first have offered the file with DCC SEND. <p> /DCC CLOSE &lt;type&gt; &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;arguments&gt; <p> Ends an unwanted DCC connection or offer. The, &lt;nickname&gt; and &lt;arguments&gt; must be the same as those shown by " /DCC LIST ". If the arguments are not supplied, the oldest connection of the specified type is closed. <p> /DCC LIST <p> Shows current /DCC connections with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in ircII online help : try " /HELP DCC " for more information. <p> If someone asks you to send him a file, do n't do it unless you exactly know what you are doing. For instance, NEVER send the password file of your system to anybody. This could grant crackers illegal access to your machines, and put you and your system administrator in a lot of trouble. <p> DCC also allows two clients to establish a direct client connection for chat. This is a secure form of communication, since messages are not sent through the IRC network. <p> /DCC CHAT <p> Initiates a direct client connection chat to the given nick, who must repond with DCC CHAT. Once established, messages are sent over with " /MSG =Nickname... ". <h> 2.6 Network Related Commands <p> If you encounter any problem, contact your local IRC-Administrator or an IRC-Operator. An IRC-Admin is a person who has access to all files concerning ' ircd '( the server program). An IRC-Operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to him by an IRC-Admin and tries to maintain a fast reliable IRC network. Information on how you can find out who s/he is, can be found below. <p> Each time you are prompted for a server name, remember you can supply the nickname of someone being connected on that server instead. This may be useful at times. <p> Shows a list of servers currently connected to the IRC network. If &lt;wildcard expression&gt; is given, /LINKS asks the given &lt;server&gt; for a list of servers matching the given expression,( this list can get very long!). <p> Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the IRC network can send out the information that you have left your previous server. So do n't be surprised if you are told your nickname is already in use... Just wait a moment and set it with /NICK again. <p> /MOTD &lt;server&gt; <p> Gives the Message-Of-The-Day for the named server. If no server is given, your server is used. <h> 2.8 Further into ircII Wizardry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRC'ers. <p> Because ircII is not a simple client program, but an Operating System, its programming language is just as simple as you could expect( it 's horrendous), but if you want to get into it, here 's a little note for you. <p> There are a few Unix environment variables you can set in your shell configuration file, but you need to find out your shell name before that. " echo $SHELL " should give you a hint. <p> The command character,( usually " /irchelp/ "), is only necessary when you type commands interactively. When you program things it is no longer needed although it used to be. <p> Table 14 : Advanced commands **27;6576;TOOLONG Keyword Action # same as COMMENT except for the lenght @ performs variable expressions ALIAS creates command aliases ASSIGN creates user variables( expandable with $) BIND binds a keystroke sequence to a function CD changes ircII working directory COMMENT does nothing, but very useful. Strange, uh? ECHO displays all of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending output from the server IF standard boolean expression checker LOAD loads an ircII command script file ON sets up actions to occur when certain events happen REDIRECT forwards the output from a command SAVE saves all ircII settings into a file SAY same as sending text to a channel SEND same as sending text to a channel SET sets a variable to a given value SLEEP suspends ircII for a few seconds TYPE simulates keystrokes WAIT waits for all server output to finish WHILE another control command to make loops WINDOW lets you manipulate multiple " windows " in ircII XECHO like ECHO, but takes flag arguments <p> If you want to type to the channel from within an ALIAS or on BINDing, you have to use SAY or SEND. <p> The " ; " has a special meaning in ALIASes, BINDings and ONs : it 's treated as command separator, that means you can execute multiple commands in a row separated by semicolons. The semicolons are not considered separators when you use them interactively,( to be able to type " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script file. You can escape the meaning of " ; " in an ALIAS with " ; ". <p> When you use ircII on a( semi) regular basis, you will discover that every time you start the program you will issue the same initialization sequence. If that is the case, I have good news for you : you do n't have to do that anymore! ircII will, at startup, load a file called ". ircrc ",( full path : $HOME/.ircrc). It will treat each line in that file as if you typed it manually. <p> For example, if the content of your. ircrc file is : <p> JOIN #TwilightZone <p> then each time you will start IRC, you will join this channel. <p> Advanced commands may come in handy if you need them. Feel free to browse in ircII online help to find out more about them. A few of them are probably worth learning. <h> 2.10 Writing automatons <p> An automaton,( also called robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the IRC network to provide services. Many people try to set that up with a few ircII commands like : <p> on msg " % help " notice $0 This is LameBot 1.0 <p> However, you should know that setting up an automaton using ircII ON facilities is quick and dirty, and should be reserved for robots that rely on ircII specific features such as DCC( file servers for instance). Writing a program in C, perl or any decent programming language should take longer in the beginning, but your efforts will be rewarded. You can download skeletons of such programs on some ftp sites that keep IRC related stuff( check in the Frequently Asked Questions part). <p> Although most robots-writers believe they have created a " smart thing ", 99% of the robots online happen to be a nuisance to the IRC community, because a few simple rules were not respected by their owners. The main idea is that robots should neither be seen nor heard : <p> automatons should be clearly identified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " srv " in their nickname. <p> they should use NOTICES to communicate with the rest of the world, and not reply to NOTICES they get. <p> they should be able to always be killed( craziness is a frequent disease among robots). <p> they should be able to be killed remotely by their owner via IRC. <p> they should not give access to their owner 's real files,( bandits have already been able to crack people 's accounts through their robots). <p> they should not send messages to channels( unless the channel is dedicated to that robot). <p> they should not flood channels with MODE changes. Basically, if you have such a command as : <p> And this will get boring very soon, so do n't be surprised if such robots get banned from most channels. A good kludge is to wait until someone asks explicitly the robot to be opped on a channel. This could be : <p> For Unix machines, you either compile the source yourself, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you. The current " official " ircII release is version 2.2.1. That means that it is said to be quite bugfree( Hehe, you never know...) In addition to this " official " distribution, you may find preversions of the client to come floating around, for people who like to track down bugs and taste things to come. However, you should be aware of that those clients are being worked on, and may not have all features working properly. <p> You now have to go into ircII2.2.1 and read the files explaining how to achieve a successful installation. Have a look at README and INSTALL, edit config.h to define DEFAULTSERVER, edit Makefile to define INSTALLEXECUTABLE, IRCIILIBRARY and the C compiler you will be using, then type make install and wait. <p> If you ca n't set up a client on any local machine, you can still use any telnet client : <p> This is by no means, a comprehensive list, but merely a start. Connect to the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are in Europe, #EU-Opers. When you are there, immediately ask what you want. Do n't say " I have a question " because then everyone will ignore you until you say it a few times, and then they 'll jump down your throat and rip your lungs out. No one knows if he can answer your question until you ask it. <h> 3.3 What are good channels to try while using IRC? <p> #Hottub and #riskybus are almost always teeming with people. #Hottub is meant to simulate a hot tub, and #riskybus is a non-stop quiz show similar to Jeopardy. Just join the fun and find out!( German users may try channels named after German university towns...) <p> Many IRC Operators are in #TwilightZone, while European Operators congregate in #EU-Opers. So if you join an Operator channel and do n't hear much talking, do n't worry ; it 's not because you joined. Operators do n't talk much on such channels anyways! <h> 3.4 How do I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you send using control chars : parts of text surrounded by control-b( B) will appear in video reverse to most ircII users for instance. However the appearance of such effects relies on the terminal abilities of the user you 're writing to. <p> In some cases keys are already bound to something. For instance, B is normally bound to BACKWARDCHARACTER, so you will need to define a " quote-character " key : just enter " /BIND W QUOTECHARACTER " then " /BIND WB SELFINSERT " and it may work. <h> 3.5 What if someone tells me to type something cryptic? <p> NEVER type anything anyone tells you to without knowing what it is. There is a problem with typing a certain command with the ircII client that gives anyone immediate control of your client,( and thus can alter your account environment also). Look in the ircII on-line help each time you can. <h> 3.6 I get strange characters on my screen, what are they? <p> IRC has quite a few people from Scandinavian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to support the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character set, but your client must be able to display them.) This has been explained on IRC about a thousand and one times, so read the following, do not ask it on IRC : <p> Table 19 : Nordic countries character translations **40;6605;TOOLONG... Character Description, ' a ' with two dots over it, ' a ' with a small circle above it, ' o ' with two dots over it, or a dash( " /irchelp/ ") through it( " ", " ", and " " = upper case) <p> In addition to that, Japanese IRC'ers use a special ANSI escape control sequences to transmit their Kanji alphabet. This may also look funny if you get some of it. Here 's a sample : $B$? $K$7$B ; $m$K#( nice, uh?) <h> 3.7 What about NickServ? <p> To quote from NickServ 's help text, NickServ 's purpose is to help avoiding nickname confusions on IRC. There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends a warning to anyone else who signs on with your nickname. If you do n't use IRC for 10 weeks, your nickname registration expires for reuse. <p> Only a NickServ operator can change your NickServ password. To find out which NickServ operators are on-line, send : <p> /MSG NickServ@Service.de OPERWHO <p> Nicknames with a " * " next to them are online at the time. <p> Note : As of this writing, NickServ is down and it is uncertain when or if it will return. <h> 3.9 How do I get rid of a ghosted IRC session? <p> Sometimes you may have a " ghosted " IRC session, a process still running on your machine you would like to get rid of, but ca n't control anymore to issue a QUIT command. Going back to a unix shell, try listing your processes :( " ps -ux " or " ps -f " depending on your system) <p> Locate the line about your lost IRC session,( irc should appear in the COMMAND field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process number, second field of the line here). In this example the PID is 25634, as shown here : <p> All you then need to type is " kill -KILL " or " kill -9 " immediatly followed by the PID found above : " kill -kill 25634 " here. <p> You can get more details about the commands involved here in the standard unix manual,( " man 1 ps " or " man 1 kill "). <p> If your machine crashed, and your nick is still in use on the IRC network, you 'll have to wait 4 to 5 minutes for your server to recognize the fact. Getting an Operator to kill the ghost is almost never necessary, just sign on as another nickname and wait for the " Ping timeout " or " Bad link " message, then you can change your nick back. <h> 3.10 About KILL usage <p> KILL is a command restricted to IRC-Operators to deal with protocol errors heavily reducing the IRC network functionality. It 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> KILL should never interfere with channel-operator status. <p> If you op someone on a channel, you take the consequences. If someone joins #Whatever, you op them, then they kick everyone and lock the channel with some " Mode change +ib *! *@* ", then suffer it : it 's your fault, do n't go whining to an IRC-op to fix it. If a channel is locked, you should start a new one. <p> Effective methods to deal with obnoxious people are IGNORE, KICK and various MODEs on channels, such as +i and/or +b. <p> If you have been unjustifiably killed by an IRC-Operator abusing his power to gain illegal channel-operator status for instance, yell! Mail a log to his server IRC-Administrator,( see ADMIN), join #TwilightZone or #EU-Opers for European-related problems, and explain what happened. <h> 3.11 Where can I find more? <p> Should your question not be listed above, you may want to check the " Frequently Unasked Questions ",( FUQ) list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies to : <p> &lt;lamer1&gt;&gt; Are there any good FTP sites?( 1) &lt;lamer2&gt; How do I join a channel? &lt;lamer3&gt; How do I become an IRCop? <p> If you have access to Usenet News,( usually through a program called rn, trn, xrn or nn), you may want to join alt.irc debates, flamings and whinings. <p> You can also join various IRC related mailing lists. " Operlist " discusses current( and past) server code, routing and protocol. Mail operlist-request@eff.org to join. Another mailing list, ircd-three@eff.org exists to discuss protocol revisions for the 3.0 release of ircd, currently in planning. Mail **26;6647;TOOLONG to be added to that. There is also low-traffic mailing-lists for ircII vmsirc and irchat clients. <h> 4. ADMINISTRATIVIA <h> 4.1 Revision history <p> This is version 1.1 of this paper. Version 1.0 of the IRCprimer was released in postscript form in June 1992 because I was sick of people asking for an IRC or ircII manual( and it was a good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rasmussen did a very nice text conversion of the paper. Due to the support and many remarks I got, a new version is finally completed( special thanks to Olaf Titz!), along with Owe 's plain ascii conversion. <p> The primer is available in 3 formats : <p> IRCprimer.ps.Z : Postscript version <p> IRCprimer.txt : Plain text version <p> IRCprimer.tex.Z : Source code. <h> 4.2 Release sites for the IRCprimer <p> The latest version of the primer can be found on the following ftp sites, thanks to their admins : <h> 4.3 Copyright( C) 1993 Nicolas PIOCH <p> This manual is free ; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation ; either version 2 of the license, or( at your option) any later version. <p> This manual is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
