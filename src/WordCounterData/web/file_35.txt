They are magnificent. I know this story from a camp. I read it to another kid and myself. Also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to " World Almanac 's Atlas of the World 2008, " one hundred percent( 100%) of the frontier trees in Europe are gone( frontier forest is the new term for virgin forest), cut for housing, defense, ships, you name it. In Asia sixty percent( 60%) of the frontier forest is gone. <p> " The People Who Hugged Trees " is a 300-year-old story about Amrita Devi and her fellow villagers who defied authority to protect their trees.
