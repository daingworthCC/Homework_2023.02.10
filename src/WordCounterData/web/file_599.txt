5086841 <p> I 've had some really great running buddies in my life -- people who push me to go faster, friends that require at least a 2+ hour run to get through all our stories, those that motivate me to go farther than I thought I could. And they 've all helped me to become the runner I am today.( Not that I 'm that accomplished, but I can clock some slow miles with the best of ' em!) <p> A few months back, I sent Matt an e-mail asking if he 'd sign up for the half with me. Maybe it was " there 's only 100 spots left " sense of urgency, or the training plan I built that looked pretty manageable, but somehow my request was accepted. <p> We trained most all of our runs together. With busy careers and lots of fun social things going on, our morning runs served as a nice solace. A time for just the two of us to be together -- a time that seems increasingly rare. Matt took every increase in mileage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( These are the two biggest indicators of running success, if you ask me.) <p> Deep down, I always wanted to be one of those active couples that run together. Not just because they look cute running around the park together, but because it 's a good investment in our future health. <h> About <p> Hi, there. I 'm Amelia. I think of myself as a walking dichotomy. I grew up on a farm, showing sheep at the county fair in rural Ohio..... Now, I wear suits everyday, carry a Kate Spade briefcase and am glued to my Blackberry. I run marathons, eat my 7 servings of vegetables everyday, and go to bootcamp at my gym 4 days a week.... yet I love anything cheesy
