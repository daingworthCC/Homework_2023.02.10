5258641 <h> i thought i was the only one but now.... <h> i thought i was the only one but now.... <p> I used to think maybe there was something wrong with me as to why I have suffered so much and continue to suffer due to pcism. I too was raised in a religious home where I was taught we were the only right ones and everybody else was lost. I remember being told that i would be left behind in a rapture and most likely get killed. thats rough for a little boy to handle. I often could not concentrate at school, and my grades suffered tremendously. often times had to be sent home due to panic attacks. this was in the ninth grade! I grew up and developed general anxiety disorder and depression. still taking meds for those. now my son who is an adult cant even hold a job because he lives in fear, so i support him. I was discouraged to go to college so i ended up in my fifties with an ok job but I wonder what I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still dealing with things and I hope you folks can offer help. It 's hard to seek professional help because therapists do nt seem to know much about pentecostalism, at least the ones Ive seen. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time in this forum! thanks for being there! <p> The good news is you are not the only one who experienced what you have, so you are not alone. Anxiety disorders are the common consequence of exposure to Pentecostalism. Everyone is my Pentecostal family suffered from generalized anxiety and/or panic attacks. That says a lot about just how unhealthy Pentecostalism is. We were taught to fear demons, the devil, the rapture and being left behind, and most of all the face-to-face encounter with the angry Pentecostal God. Even death offered no escape from the fear! <p> I encourage you to stick with your therapist/doctor and accept the help he/she can offer. Most on this forum can offer you understanding and the we 've been there and have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Your story is achingly familiar. Growing up I thought something was wrong with me and everyone else in church was normal. Nowadays I can look back and see the pente church I grew up in for the total insane asylum it truly was. You are so right to wonder about what " might have been " if not for the pente church...... I 've wondered about that A LOT. It definitely changed who I was, to be subjected to the terror and the insults I heard as a small child. And the perception of the pente church in my community changed the way that others related to me...... my teachers, coaches, parents of my friends, they all saw me as a child of members of that crazy whacked out church with the strange noises going on all hours of the night. I 'm sure they thought I was as ignorant as the rest of them. <p> I hope you find lots in this forum that will help you and give you peace. Take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to help your son. <p> had some wierd dreams and woke up about 5am and started feeling triggers of panic. I took my meds and got up and watched tv for about an hour. did not have a full blown panic attack but I could feel the depression and hopeless thoughts but after about an hour was able to fall back asleep. still dealing with issues I guess. <p> Welcome! You 're definitely NOT alone. I think I 've been on here for close to three years, and it took quite some time before I could talk about my story at all. Still a lot of things I have n't shared. Things are much better, but I can still get triggered into some pretty awful places. <p> Elizabeth Niederer wrote : Welcome! You 're definitely NOT alone.

I read posts, feel I have so much to say but when it comes to saying it, I just ca n't. Do n't seem to have got to the place where I can easily verbalise stuff. It surprises me every time. <p> And xpentedean, welcome. As Elizabeth said, you 're most definitely not the only one. But I remember when I used to think I was the only one too. <p> After years of being told that nothing was wrong and that doubt came from Satan... I finally got a whiff of the proverbial coffee. It helped that I has supportive friends outside who basically told me that they 'd be there to help when I cam out of it. I did, and they were. <p> If you can, find a support group. Something for abusive relationship survivors, or for ex-members of( we do not you the ' c word ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups)... It is easier to deal with the world if you have a little help finding your way in it. <p> No, you are not alone. We are here. And we are here to help and support you. <p> Yes, Molly, if you go back through my posting history( please, do n't feel obligated to do that LOL!), somewhere in there I wrote a post where I said exactly that. The emotional pain was so bad that I could even begin to put it into words. I was so grateful to see myself in
