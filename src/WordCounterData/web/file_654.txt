5092441 <h> The Tip Jar <h> November 16, 2012 <p> The government affairs arm of McGuireWoods has launched a new practice, the firm announced this week. <p> McGuireWoods Consulting has established a strategic advisory services practice in an effort to help businesses " better align their public affairs capabilities with sales, legal, accounting and other operational areas, ultimately lowering risk and increasing returns " and " get in front of issues, while also driving sales and accomplishing business development goals, " according to the firm. Brad Alexander, an Atlanta-based senior vice president of McGuireWoods Consulting, is leading the practice, which has eight core members. <p> Strategic advisory services are " relevant for people who have a very important issue, which they need to get right, " said former Representative L.F. Payne( D-Va.), president of McGuireWoods Consulting. <p> A former project attorney at Eckert Seamans Cherin &; Mellott who unsuccessfully sued the firm for wrongful termination lost her appeal yesterday before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. <p> A three-judge panel found( PDF) that Katherine Wallace failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired for refusing to produce shoddy work in the name of higher productivity. Wallace had alleged that the firm 's demands would have caused her to not only break the law, but also violate the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct. <p> Wallace, now a local solo practitioner, declined to comment, saying she had n't had a chance yet to review the opinion. The firm, through lead counsel John May of Washington 's Jordan Coyne &; Savits, declined to comment. <p> An upscale New York City steakhouse has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle charges by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that managers sexually harassed 22 male waiters over an almost eight-year period. <p> The EEOC 's case against Sparks Steak House highlights a growing EEOC trend - going after instances of male-on-male sexual harassment. <p> According to the EEOC complaint against Sparks, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in 2009, misconduct by managers included " regularly grabbing or pinching male employees ' buttocks and/or pushing their penises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of male employees. " According to the EEOC, many of the waiters complained, but the behavior did not stop. <p> Justice Samuel Alito defended the 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission on Thursday night, jabbing at critics of the U.S. Supreme Court 's majority opinion but also admitting the success of their public relations campaign. <p> Alito said arguments can be made for overturning Citizens United, but not the popular one that boils down to one line : Corporations should n't get free speech rights like a person. <p> " It is pithy, it fits on a bumper sticker, and in fact a variety of bumper stickers are available, " Alito told a crowd of about 1,400 at The Federalist Society 's annual dinner. He cited two : " End Corporate Personhood, " and " Life does not begin at incorporation. " <p> And that 's just what happened yesterday. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler dismissed Shea 's second suit, saying it closely resembled the first case. <p> Shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, alleged the company bilked the government for reimbursement of certain prohibited surcharges. DOJ joined the suit in 2007, and the case later settled for $93.5 million. Verizon did n't admit wrongdoing. The case involved telecommunications contracts with the General Services Administration. <p> Lanny Breuer is taking the government 's new anti-corruption resource guide on a roadshow today, speaking at legal events in the Washington area just days after the publication of a much-anticipated memo that clarifies the scope of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. <p> This morning Breuer was in National Harbor, Md., to address the American Conference Institute 's annual conference on corruption. Breuer this afternoon is scheduled to participate in a panel discussion at the Federalist Society convention in Washington. <p> Breuer was supposed to address the American Conference Institute yesterday. But the announcement of BP 's guilty pleas in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill trumped his speech. Breuer did n't mention BP 's fines and penalty today in his prepared remarks. F. Joseph Warin of Gibson, Dunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case, introduced Breuer today at the conference. <p> But back to the FCPA. Breuer dedicated the start of his remarks to a description of DOJ 's overall anti-corruption fight. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Criminal Division, said the department has more than doubled the number of prosecutors working to enforce foreign bribery laws. <h> November 15, 2012 <p> The Federal Trade Commission today announced it approved the $2.3 billion merger of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. and Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc., but will require the divestiture of Hertz 's Advantage Rent A Car plus the rights to operate 29 Dollar-Thrifty airport locations. <p> The pending merger, which was widely followed by the antitrust bar amidst reports that the FTC was gearing up to fight the deal in court, was announced in August. The FTC alleged that the deal as originally proposed would have harmed competition at 72 airports around the United States and reduced the number of major competitors from four to three. <p> " Today 's bipartisan action by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay higher prices for rental cars when they travel, " said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz in a news release. <p> The former assistant inspector general for investigations at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the agency today for defamation, alleging SEC officials smeared him in the press after he disclosed misconduct by employees including his ex-boss H. David Kotz. <p> David Weber, who was fired on Oct. 31, filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that " SEC officers and employees tried to ' cover up ' and ' whitewash ' these public relations disasters by discrediting Mr. Weber, defaming him in the public media with baseless and malicious accusations, unlawfully placing him on administrative leave status, and, later, wrongfully terminating his employment. " <p> The SEC brought in the inspector general of the U.S. Postal Service to investigate Weber 's claims against Kotz as well as allegations that Weber created a hostile work environment. The Postal Service IG in a September 17 final report said interviews with SEC employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work environment or displayed threatening behavior within the workplace, " according to the report. <p> However, the report did find Kotz may have had conflicts of interest in some investigations and had a personal relationship with a woman who represented victims of Allen Stanford 's Ponzi scheme. <p> Mayer Brown announced today that it had promoted 21 lawyers in its offices worldwide to partner, including two lawyers in its Washington office. <p> The new partners in Washington are Ann Marie Duffy, who has an intellectual property practice, and Adam Hudes, who handles litigation and dispute resolution. <p> " In addition to outstanding legal skills, these lawyers have demonstrated leadership, business acumen, excellence in client service and commitment to teamwork across practice areas and geographic boundaries, and we are delighted to welcome them as Mayer Brown partners, " firm Chairman Paul Theiss said in a statement. <p> PepsiCo Inc. has turned to a top White House aide to lead its lobbying efforts, the food and beverage company announced on Wednesday. <p> Alan Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vice President Joe Biden and deputy assistant to President Barack Obama, will become PepsiCo 's senior vice president of global public policy and government affairs on November 26.

The penalty far exceeds the $1.3 billion fine Pfizer forked over in 2009 for the false marketing of Bextra pain medication. <p> As part of the pending settlement, BP plead guilty to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect of ships officers. The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig killed 11 workers and pumped oil into the Gulf of Mexico for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The FBI agent who took the initial complaint from Jill Kelley has been identified as Frederick W.

As part of the proposed deal, the rental car company will divest 15 airport locations. <h> November 14, 2012 <p> President Barack Obama announced seven nominations for federal district courts on Wednesday, asking the Senate to promptly consider all his judicial nominees because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The nominations, coming just one day after the Senate returned to session after the presidential election, was cheered by liberal groups that have long decried the political stalemate that has stalled judicial confirmations and left bench seats open. <p> " We are so glad to see President Obama take such decisive and needed action today to help end the vacancy crisis, " American Constitution Society President Caroline Fredrickson said in a written statement. " By nominating these judges so quickly after his re-election, he has made it clear that our courts are a priority. " <p> The National Fair Housing Alliance and Paralyzed Veterans of America settled a housing discrimination lawsuit against HHHunt Corporation on Wednesday. <p> The lawsuit was initially filed on the grounds that HHHunt, a Virginia-based real estate development company, discriminated against people with disabilities since 2002 by constructing multifamily homes and public areas without the required accessibility features. <p> The HHHunt Corporation was found in violation of the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or familial status. <p> Lawyer up -- that 's what two of the central characters embroiled in the David Petraeus scandal have done. But what are the best practices for attorneys and public relations officials when representing clients in high-profile matters like this? <p> Robert Bennett, the Hogan Lovells partner who represented President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, said in an interview that in situations like this, it 's best to put all the facts out at once rather than drag on the story for multiple days. <p> " The primary rule is to get it out and get it all out, " Bennett said. He likened the media frenzy that often surrounds scandals like this to Count Dracula. " He needs blood every day, " Bennett said. <p> As the D.C. Council on Thursday holds its first legislative meeting since the election, a leading nonpartisan advocate for government transparency has a proposal for the body to consider. <p> The Sunlight Foundation on Tuesday posted on its blog language the Council could use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. law, lobbyists must file with the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance semiannual reports that publicly disclose their efforts to influence members of the city 's legislative and executive branches. But Sunlight 's proposal would require lobbyists to reveal to the Office of Campaign Finance within 72 hours contacts they made with D.C. officials and to submit to the agency monthly reports on their government advocacy efforts. <p> Matthew Rumsey, Sunlight 's policy associate, wrote in the blog post that the current frequency of lobbying disclosure is " inadequate, " making it difficult for the public to monitor how lobbyists are influencing the D.C. government. More than a dozen states mandate that lobbyists file monthly reports and New Mexico requires them to disclose their contacts within 48 hours when the state 's legislature is in session, he notes.( The federal government requires quarterly updates from lobbyists.) <p> Federal prosecutors and securities regulators today unveiled the government 's much-anticipated guidance for foreign-bribery enforcement, intending to provide companies and individuals a clearer picture of the conduct the government wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Securities and Exchange Commission officials prepared the 120-page Foreign Corrupt Practices Act( FCPA) guide, addressing, among other things, the definition of a foreign official, proper and improper gifts and the " hallmarks " of effective corporate compliance. <p> " Corruption is a global problem, " the guide says in an opening passage. " In the three decades since Congress enacted the FCPA, the extent of corporate bribery has become clearer and its ramifications in a transnational economy starker. " Click here for a copy of the guidance. <p> That 's Classified : The FBI is making a new push to determine how a woman who had an affair with retired Gen. David H. Petraeus when he was CIA director obtained classified files - a surprise move that follows assertions by U.S. officials that the investigation had turned up no evidence of a security breach, t he Washington Post reports. <p> Edge of the Cliff : Corporate America is raising the volume of its plea that the U.S. government avert a year-end " fiscal cliff " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives are n't pushing the panic button just yet, Reuters reports. <p> Collective Bargaining : A Wisconsin law enforcement union sued the state Tuesday over the state 's collective bargaining law, alleging that the portions of the law pertaining to teachers and municipal workers that were found unconstitutional by a Dane County judge are also unconstitutional for state workers, t he Wisconsin State Journal reports. <h> November 13, 2012 <p> Raj Date, the number two official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is leaving the agency at the end of January. <p> Agency spokeswoman Jennifer Howard confirmed Date 's departure, but said he has not announced his future plans, " other than to spend more time with his family.

We are fortunate that Dave Shonka will serve as acting general counsel, as he did very admirably before Will became General Counsel. " <p> Between October 2006 and July of this year, judges in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on average sentenced 147 defendants in criminal cases. According to a new study, the city 's federal court had the smallest average criminal caseload of any federal court nationwide during that time. <p> The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, released the results yesterday of a new analysis of sentencing data from the federal courts. TRAC, which is based at Syracuse University, measured criminal caseloads by the number of defendants sentenced per judge ; TRAC Co-Director Susan Long said they thought sentencings would be a useful measuring tool because most criminal cases in the federal courts end in a guilty plea or conviction. <p> But U.S. District Chief Judge Royce Lamberth of the D.C.-based court said he did n't think the study was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it put all criminal cases on an even playing field, regardless of their complexity or how long they took to resolve. <p> McKenna Long &; Aldridge has appointed a new managing partner of its Washington office. <p> Joanne Zimolzak succeeds Thomas Papson, who served in the role since 2003.

Brown must complete 480 hours of community service. <p> Brown was sentenced this morning in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in downtown Washington. He will be transported this afternoon across the street to D.C. Superior Court, where he has a pending campaign finance violation. The case against Brown was the latest in a series of recent prosecutions against local officials brought by the office of U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen Jr. <p> Today in federal court, in a crowded courtroom, Brown spoke briefly about his fall from grace -- about his personal disappointment, the embarrassment in the community, the lost opportunities. Brown admitted falsifying information on bank loans. In one instance, he overstated his income to buy a luxury boat. <p> Cleary Gottlieb Steen &; Hamilton has added James Freis, Jr., the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enforcement Network, or FinCen, as counsel to its Washington office. <p> As head of FinCen, Freis, 42, led the development and enforcement of regulations combating money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other financial crimes.
