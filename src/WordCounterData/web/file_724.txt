5099541 <p> but for EF-S cameras users it makes an interesting alternative to the EF-S 60 f/2.8 USM Macro. <p> I 'm predicting that the macro quality of this 4/24-70 will be way lower than that of the EF-S 2.8/60... the only advantage is the IS, for those doing macro work outside in low light without tripod... <p> I 'm sure you will be proved right, but I 'm equally sure it does n't matter. A feature like this is n't intended for serious macro where a flat field and sharpness right into the corners matter. Being able to focus down to 0.7x while retaining decent image quality is a killer feature and totally unexpected. <p> The close focusing semi-macro ability of my Sigma 18-50 is one of the reasons I still have n't upgraded it, so I 'm fully in tune with why 0.7x magnification is a great feature in a full-frame kit lens
