5032541 <p> Whilst I 'm still making some changes to the goal commitment ebook, I got an inspiration to write about a subject that is very important yet not so much has been written about it. It is, namely, You do n't have to do anything you do n't want or like. <p> Sometimes when some of my friends or even people seeking my advice complain that they have to go to work five days a week, I can not help but ask : <p>? So why do you do that if you do n't like it?? <p>... and in almost all cases, I get the answer : <p>? Because I have to.? <p> That 's the wrong answer. You do n't have to do anything you do n't like. Nobody forces you to do this or that because it is only up to you to decide what to do. It was your decision to start working for some company and it is up to you to continue working there or to quit. <p> Sometimes people thoughtlessly get themselves into all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they focus on the created bondage and fail to see the obvious way out. <p> But there is always a way out. And even if you do n't see one, you can simply raise your standards and demand of life what you feel you deserve. This always works wonders if you do it for long enough. <p> That 's what happens when you decide to raise your standards and commit to your decisions. Life must eventually give what you ask for, but only if you do n't give up asking for the best out of it. <p> So no, there is absolutely nothing in this world that you have to do. You can choose what you want to do. You do n't have to stay in a relationship that does not work ; You do n't have to suffer from a controlling boss ; You do n't have to be with friends who only use you. You can quit absolutely everything you do n't like and do something you love instead. <p> But what keeps people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Fear stops the creativity that every person has and dooms them to failure. People who fear can not succeed because they are taking action with the wrong intention that creates failure rather than opportunities. <p> You must have faith that the change you are going to make in your life will bring amazing results. If you have faith that it will, it has to. At no circumstances allow fear to enter your mind as it will destroy all the good that is awaiting you. <p> Never dwell on the feeling of fear and other negativity and consciously make yourself think positively. It will become habitual if you keep doing that. <p> Sometimes making radical changes is the only way to wealth and success to some people. I have in mind people who talk that they are someday going to make a major change but do n't do anything to make their words their reality. The only way for such people to succeed is to make a massive change and then they will take action because they will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lose their homes. <p> You may have read in some books about a phenomenon that happens to people who lose everything, make a massive change or are in some tragedy? they are introduced to their other selves who know all the answers. They come into contact with their spiritual side and become aware of the exact things they should do to get themselves out of the poverty and misery into the abundance, health and success. <p> Of course, you can change gradually and surely, but saying no to the things you do which do n't make you happy and making a big change immediately will get you where you want to be much faster. <p> Remember the massive change that you made in your life in the past. As you see, it always turns out to be beneficial. For example, if you decided to quit the job which sapped energy from you, you soon found a great position within a much better company. If you decided to end the dead relationship which dragged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams. That always happens, it is as though the universe rewards you for your courage. <p> So no, you do n't have to do anything you do n't like. Nobody forces you to take any kind of action, it is only you and your convictions that keep you stuck. You can change this anytime you want and the best time to do that is NOW. <h> Get FREE Gifts <h> About Simona Rich <p> My name is Simona Rich and I help people improve themselves through the articles and products of this website.
