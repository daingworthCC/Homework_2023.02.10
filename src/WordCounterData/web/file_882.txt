5258041 <h> Skype Preview for Windows Phone 8 is now available! Hands on video. <p> Oh what a weekend it has been. With the launch of Windows Phone 8 on AT &T; and Verizon and T-Mobile expected in the next week, it has been quite exciting but now it is coming to full steam with the release of Skype for Windows Phone 8. <p> Yes, the app is now slipping out to the Store and we managed to get our hands on it. Heck, we 're even going to give you a video demo of it after the break to see it in action. <p> Skype for Windows Phone 8 brings the dream to reality of mobile VOIP. By running seamlessly in the background( like on Window 8), users can sign in once and always remain online without having to worry about battery life. That trick is done through Microsoft hosting your presence in the cloud on their servers instead of you using your phone. In turn, you 're always on( though you can set yourself to " invisible " should you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video chat is supported, which works much better now due to WP8 's increased hardware( dual core 1.5GHz CPUs and that new GPU). Users can chat while talking, switch to speakerphone or the earpiece, minimize calls and even turn off the screen -- it 's all there. Calls come in like " normal " phone calls giving you the experience of Skype just being there. <p> From our brief experience with it, we were quite impressed with the quality and the abilities. Time will tell if there are bugs and optimizations that need to be done in order to improve things, but so far, it 's pretty awesome. <p> You can pick up Skype for Windows Phone 8 here right now in the Store. If you 're having trouble downloading it, give it some time as this link is hot of the presses. <p> Note : If you are still getting the old version, you 'll have to wait until the Store gets the update pushed out in your area/region. But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and in the UK. Also, use the link *on your phone* not via the web for quicker results <p> i had asked this question in the skype forum last week and never got an official answer other than set yourself to invisible... But, lets say i use my WP8 device with Skype while out and about somewhere, i come home, and want to log on to a desktop/laptop skype now? Where will my incoming calls be routed to? Will my chatr msgs be routed to both clients? Questions that need to be answered before we use the WP8 version which keeps us always available. I love the idea of it - but need a way to route calls etc. <p> Messages and calls are pushed to all connected clients( instances). You simply answer as usual from whichever device you want to use. So if you have 3 devices( 2 computers 1 phone - as is commonplace for me) then they will all receive messages and calls. You ca n't move a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( or re-join if its a group conversation). <p> i know this is how it works with my touchpad and its integrated chat/calls with skype. But atleast with the touchpad i have the option to completly log out of it and do nt have it chirping or ringing when i am sitting in front of my desktop or laptop. I think an option to not allow calls/msgs would be beneficial. I knew the answers to my questions, i wanted some feedback and open discussion about it tho! :) <p> Ok. Had to disable my data connection to get it to allow me to log in - so no 3G or LTE for me. Now that I 'm in on Wifi, I can make voice calls and send messages but all video calls fail before connecting... <p> My question is, was n't this supposed to integrate with the OS? Are contacts going to show up in People as well so I can make calls from the People Hub? <p> Edit Nevermind, was able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, my question is, how long does it take to update the list? I added a Skype contact in my home specifically to test this, and regardless of my efforts, I can not get them to show up in the People Hub. <p> All my skype account contacts imediately showed up on the people hub. just had to link most of them to the real contacts. Only problem i see is that on the toast notifications, it shows the aliases of the contacts instead of their names. Eg " dinis.costa000 " instead of " Dinis Costa " for example. A pity, since some contacts have really funky aliases which are not easy to identify <p> " In addition, full video chat is supported, which works much better now due to WP8 's increased hardware ". How about some statistics to back up that statement? Skype and Tango both worked fine on my Focus S and L900. It 's just the WP8 coding and backend improvements that allow Skype to work in the background like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a 1280x763 resolution device with a dual-core 1.5Ghz CPU and advanced GPU with 2x the RAM running on an NT kernel( instead of CE) will handle video OTA better than 2010 hardware? Seriously. I need to give you " statistics " to back that up? <p> One of my most visited sites, really look forward to all the news on here and appreciated the time and effort you put into reviews. Perhaps the guy above was after some specifics in the review, e.g. the frame rate was a lot smoother than on the Focus S, and the video call was in a much clearer resolution. Otherwise it can be hard to guage, as a reader, how much better this is than on the first gen handsets, if the review simply states it 's better, rather than quantifying in what ways it is better. I 'm not having a go, just trying to see the other point of view - hard to interpret emotion/intention from purely written words. Anyway, I for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trying out the new Skype version. All the best :) <p> I installed it, but it would n't let me log in using my MSFT account( which has been linked to my Skype). So, I uninstalled, restarted the phone and tried your link again and this time it 's saying incompatible. <p>... it ca n't be a regional problem since I have n't moved anywhere in the past couple hours... Hope it comes back in the morning=/ <p> I hate all of you for having( mostly) Lumia 920 and myself for wanting one so bad! : D Enjoy it, guys and gals, for those of us who ca n't because we live in ****** ***** ***** Balkan countries. Damn, I 'm going to strangle that T-Mobile Croatia b***h from customer support who told me waiting for Lumia 920 to arrive in Q1 2013 " is n't that long ". She probably has an iPhone 5, which arrived almost instantly on major carriers in the country, so what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the multitask? If I leave the app( back arrow or windows button) I 'm disconnectd from Skype, ca n't get call or even notification for text message. I 'm on L920 in France and skype 2.0.0.473 it seems that the issue come from my skype windows client( 5.10)( that I use for professional stuff, the account on my lumia is my personal one) <p> Update : After some more testing it seems to work as intended. It only looks like the Skype App is fooling you with that connect status after opening. Actually you stay online the whole time and recieve messages. Checked with Skype on Android from another phone. <p> I was wondering whether the chat stuff was integrated with the messaging hub? Also, how is it integrated with the people hub? If it 's not, can anybody imagine why? Would make so much sense. Was n't that a selling point of the first WP release? <p> Seriously, this is ridiculous. First, the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even really work if I just switch to another app... when using the multitasking app switcher to get back to skype, it builds up a new connection. Im goin on- and offline everytime I do anything but use the app actively. Next : Where 's the system integration we were waiting for? Having the skype contacts in my people hub? That 's all? Not even that is fully working : My contact pages do n't reflect the received skype messages in contact History. Having skype only within the skype app and not within my messages hub and in contact history is a big fail, now we are as good as any Android phone : Using separate apps for every way of communication. Why is it that they can integrate Facebook( inlcuding chat), MSN messenger, Twitter, Linkedin, into the system, but not their own future messaging system? That makes totally no sense to me. Correct me if I 'm wrong, but a full Windows Phone Skype integration is what was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later " moved " to the apollo update, and finally announced only available for WP8. Now here I am holding my new Lumia 920 and got a big disappointment. <p> agree! That skype is a alpha. Its not integrated at all. I want to have not even a skype-app to run or download, it has to come as an option to call them via skype instead of mobile from your contact-list.. the chats are in messages.. and so on.. this skype is( hopefully) just kind of : hey guys, sorry, we need longer, but at least you can use it). As far as I guess,( by looking into the integration-idea) it will be a high priority @ Microsoft to get this fixed <p> I am a bit confused about this too... It does seem from my brief testing that Skype must be started after a reboot for incoming calls. It can be closed right away, but it must have been started. Not a huge deal, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Open Points so far : - Userlist is not linked like in People( 3 times the same person) - I have bad echos while talking. Hear myself. - My phone is screenlocked with code and i have to enter the code before I can switch from Speaker to headfone. Thats too long though, Need
