5040141 <p> Watching the Steelers v. Raiders game, and I am absolutely flabbergasted that Ryan Mundy did not get a flag and thrown out of the fucking game for that hit on Darius Heyward-Bey. I hope the league office fines him steeply and suspends him for a couple games. It was clear helmet to helmet contact, and just a vicious illegal hit. On top of that, the illegal pick in the first quarter that took out the other Oakland cornerback temporarily, the missed call on the douchebag attacking Ben 's knees, the missed holding calls and everything else these refs have screwed up or missed, and this is just a fucking disgrace. These refs are as bad at calling games as David Gregory is at calling out Republican lies. <p> And yes, I know I am a Steelers homer, but this shit is unacceptable. And yes, I know it is a rough game, but these refs are going to get someone killed. This is n't about being a homer, this is about the integrity of the game and absolutely unnecessary violence. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union busting efforts at the expense of these players makes me want to vomit. <p> Just unacceptable. No one is in control of the game. Fuck you Goodell. These are people and your most valuable commodity, and you are just willing to get them killed to save a paltry 200k team. God damned disgrace. <p> This entry was posted on Sunday, September 23rd, responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. Both comments and pings are currently closed. <p> Well, as long as the players take the field, this will keep happening. It 's the players who are the key to this. It always has been. As long as they show up, there will be games. As long as there 's games, the owners will keep using shitty refs. As long as the players keep fucking the officials by not doing a solidarity strike or sick-out, this is what you 're going to keep getting. <p> But but but... The refs want a pension plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, This fight for pensions has to start somewhere and if it 's with the refs, so be it. No more of the 401k for retirement plans. You wan na make money off my labor, you have to pay. <p> Just unacceptable. No one is in control of the game. Fuck you Goodell. These are people and your most valuable commodity, and you are just willing to get them killed to save a paltry 200k a year per team. God damned disgrace. <p> Your NFL owners. Galtian assholes, for the most part. Goodell is doing exactly what they want. <p> The Goodell legacy is about to be written as ' remember the time when that guy working the salad bar at Sizzler 's was the head linesman? That sucked! ' The NFLPA has a great letter to the commisioner as Pooh mentioned. <p> As a Raven 's fan, I was utterly appalled by that hit on Roethlisbeger by the Oakland defender. Not only should there have been a flag but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! That hit was so fucking dirty I do n't know what the rule protecting QB 's was written for if that type of hit is allowed. <p> That 's what I do n't get. We fans and the teevee talking heads are all outraged about the league putting player safety at risk -- but the players union is in the best position to do something about it, and not a peep from them. Where the hell are they, and why are these union players crossing the picket line? <p> I feel the dirty hits are on the players. They made the hits, and it is up to Goodell to stop it. The ref 's do n't have the legitimacy right now to do it and they just are n't good enough to do anything about it. <p> The thing that is unacceptable to me is simple counting... like when it is 2nd down and calling it 3rd... that just shows the incompetence. <p> @ Brian : The point is that the refs do n't have control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the Redskins game last week when the Rams had been chippy with RG3 and the rest of the offense all game and then one guy finally reacts and gets a( admittedly stupid) penalty that costs them a shot at the game, but the point is that the real refs do n't let the tension escalate to that point of chippiness. If you allow dirty little shit on every player, then that grows pretty quickly into headhunting precisely because the players are n't being protected by the refs, so they take matters into their own hands, which just spirals. <p> Shitty refs do n't cause this behavior. Willing players do n't cause this behavior. WE cause this behavior by tuning in and buying tickets and by not demanding humane treatment for those that entertain us. If it 's that upsetting to you, take your money elsewhere. It really is just a game. <p> That NFLPA letter suggested that using the scab referees might be a violation of their contract with the league. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy strike. I believe I 've heard that such a strike would normally be against the current contract, but their own strike over dangerous working conditions would get around that. <p> @ suzanne : No. I 'm guessing from your performance in previous threads on the topic that you 've never played a sport that involves physical contact, but the dirtiest games occur when the refs are n't in control. Pickup games are n't generally dirty because the players explicitly police themselves. Competently reffed games are n't generally dirty because the refs exert control and the players know that shit wo n't fly and are interested in winning more than they are in blowing someone up. In games where the refs have poor control, you can have both, plus there is the added emotion of the other guy cheap shotting you. <p> @ raven : Because you made a series of really stupid and nonsensical contrarian posts with absolutely no basis in reality. Normally your football posts are just stupid. These were more of the egregiously stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league in Champaign-Urbana. Lot 's of high level former high school and college players. We had lots of problems with behavior and, one night, an ex big-10 lineman went after and official. In my capacity as the representative of the municipality, I stepped between them. This dude was going ape shit and screamed at me " we play each other every Sunday and we never have any problems. We get these goddamn refs in here and it goes to shit ". I quoted him verbatim when I made my report to the board urging that we end the program. We did. <p> That 's not really how it works, as someone suggested upthread, the letter is the first step towards an unsafe work environment. Walking off now and then trying to " backdate " that kind of claim could easily be taken as evidence of the player bargaining/operating in bad faith. <p> I have several leftish -- at least by today 's standards -- blogs on my RAS feed, and that 's that. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care. I get nearly as good football coverage from these blogs as I would from follwing ESPN. It ai n't that important, folks. I know there 's a labor angle here, but it 's amazing how many non-NFL blogs provide NFL coverage anyway. <p> The overwhelming majority of the players want the regular referees back. They have spoken out about it too. Only dirty players like Cortland Finnegan like the replacement refs because they can get away with murder. <p> As said above, the players ' CBA prevents them from doing anything other than give lip support to the regular referees. <p> I keep hearing that the replacement refs will " grow " into the job, but I keep seeing more and more mistakes with each passing week. Some of them have no freaking clue what to do out there. <p> Anyone see the referee throw his hat in the end zone and the Dallas Cowboys player slipped and fell on it? It 's like damned Keystone Kops out there. <p> But as Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As long as they are busting the referee 's union they do n't care about player safety. <p> Any interview Roger Goodell gives I hope the journalist asks him how he can sit there and lecture about player safety when the scab refs are basically allowing headhunting to go on. <p> @ Pooh : Right and I guess the point I was trying to make poorly... is I do n't blame the new guys on the field now they do n't have the legitimacy or the balls to make the needed calls. I blame the league, and the odd dirty player for taking advantage of the situation. <p> @ raven : I think you 're agreeing with me that in many cases, bad refs are worse than no refs. <p> As an interesting counterpoint I have some experience playing a largely self-officiated sport at a high level( ultimate frisbee), there has been an ongoing debate about the use of officials in high level play for over a decade, and a very commonly held position( which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game more physical and dirtier because people will quickly identify spots where the refs ca n't be looking and take liberties, whereas now, if you grab me, I call a foul. <p> @ Pooh : Why do the owners have any incentive to get rid of these shitty refs? They already know that player injuries do n't seem to dissuade viewers. There 's no impact to their bottom line if they keep the shitty refs. <p> No, I 've never engaged in contact sports.( Though cheerleading seems to be the most dangerous high school sport nowadays, go figure.) That is a deliberate choice on my part. <p> @ smith : One of the players on Football Night was just asked about players and the " substitute teacher syndrome " and whether or not players we pushing the rules to get and advantage. He said " I hope so ". <p> @ suzanne : I mean I do n't want to appeal to authority here, but you just do n't know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon is real in this spot. I mean sure, football is a violent game that involves great risk of physical injury. If you want to oppose football on that grounds, full stop, be my guest. But that has virtually nothing to do with this current debate, and all you 're doing is making the sporting equivalent of the " everything is good news for republicans " argument. <p> Compare these refs to, say, MLB umpires, who are fucking assholes and will punish players severely for even the hint of questioning their authority. <p> I think MLB umpires are a little over the top, but it is important for refs to maintain control of the game and players. That 's why they are there. If players see that other people are getting away with stuff, they will do it too. No one wants to play against an unfair advantage where some players are dirty and get away with it, so it escalates until the refs assert control. <p> @ cathyx : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money can buy prepping a walkout at the earliest possible moment that wo n't mean cutting their own throats in the process. If they do this wrong, they wo n't exist the next time the owners pull something stupid. <p> @ Pooh : No, I was agreeing that " Pickup games are n't generally dirty because the players explicitly police themselves. " In the case I cited the refs were pretty good but it was the attitude of the players toward them. When they had refs the turned their anger on them but when they played on their own they would have had to fight every other play if they did n't respect each other. <p> you want bad calls??? did anyone see that chiefs/saints game?? 8 overturns, a million and a half bad calls/wrong calls/no calls. I absolutely agree they are gon na get someone killed. when you have 8 different players on one team taken out for injuries, flips, and just stupid stuff, you have to know as an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No, I 'm saying that the owners are selfish, R-money-esque bastards( truth) who will not make a change that will cost them money or power unless they have an incentive to do so. Protecting their players has already been shown to not be much of a concern to them. Viewers are the only ones that can provide that incentive. <p> Has anyone seen Roger Goodell and Scott Walker in the same room at the same time? The people complain about Unions or Regulations do n't know their history ; Unions and Regulations are the result of fucking people over and the people getting tired of it. <p> @ Pooh : Not over time they did n't. I knew most of the people in all the leagues I ran. In fact my hippie softball team " The High and Mighty " were notorious for getting in shit. It was pretty amazing they hired me the clean up the leagues. We had a mix of hippies and x-Illini athletes that made for great parties and pretty decent ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the season. Any Steelers fan with any respect for the sport will burn their Rapelisberger jersey after this game. Nothing but cheap, illegal hits all game long, and they still could n't beat the Raiders. Maybe if they actually kill someone next game ; God knows they tried today. <p> Today 's newspaper had an astonishing array of bizarre pink-colored stuff for sale in honor of breast cancer, which let me say I 'm so fucking sick of seeing everything pink. I posted a picture of the ad on my blog, I think you 'll be amused. <p> There 's a potential impact : if fans genuinely dislike badly officiated games, they 'll stop watching and the league will notice that TV viewership and maybe even in-person attendance* are going down. My interest in the NFL has been waning for years, and the bits and pieces I 've seen so far this year have done nothing to rekindle my interests. Bad refs make the games less fun to watch, and the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the real refs are back. <p> *This is unlikely, since teams seem to deliberately set ticket prices at a level where there 's a substantial excess demand. <p> Romney is such an unbelievable douchebag. He 's not even trying to hide it anymore. You say that shit on Fox News when just your mouth-breathing imbecile base is watching, not on 60 Minutes when normal people are watching. <p> Start a movement to convince people to stop watching. Get the majority of viewers to stop watching. <p> Convince people to stop going to the games. Let players play in empty stadiums. <p> Make it a mark of shame to go to or watch games. <p> That sort of financial hit plus shaming is the only way the owners will change their minds. <p> These are people and your most valuable commodity, and you are just willing to get them killed to save a paltry 200k a year per team. <p> There are a whole bunch of players willing to take the place of those playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury. Players are cogs in the wheel of greedy owners ' business. There will always be replacements until and unless the players take a stand and/or the fans take a stand and quit watching. <p> Love your page but if this is the NFL union busting, which I believe it is, then why are you watching it. If you truly believe in unionism and solidarity then turn off the game and watch something else. If you do n't then you are enabling the busting. <p> @ Villago Delenda Est : This is not really about saving $200K on the refs. That 's chump change to the NFL owners. This is about fucking over the refs as a example to the players union, who 's basic agreement is coming due next year. They want to show that they can screw anyone they want, and the refs are an easy target. They could just as easily gone after the hot dog vendors at the stadium. <p> The parties settled the lawsuit on July 25, 2011, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA ' s status as the players ' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. 45 The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. <p> if fans genuinely dislike badly officiated games, they 'll stop watching and the league will notice that TV viewership and maybe even in-person attendance* are going down. <p> Yes, I agree. Perhaps I was n't clear. As long as people watch, and buy NFL tickets and gear, then the owners do n't have any incentive to get rid of the bad refs. But when viewers stop watching, that will send a message loud and clear. Players that get injured can be replaced by countless others, ready and willing to risk their health for the promise of money and fame. <p> @ Chief : I 'm only watching because the local Buffalo Wild Wings a) has The Most Awesome Soda Machine on the Planet, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( I ca n't find another place with even one), and b) a bunch of employees that do n't mind if I sit in one of their booths for eight hours writing while spending nothing but the $2.48 they charge me for all of The Most Awesome Soda I can drink, plus a really big tip. <p> The Niners are my team, but I dig the Raiders, too. Where their mutual interests collide, go Niners. <p> I first paid attention to the Raider 's during the second half of the Immaculate Deception Game. I was waiting on the Niner-Cowboy play-off game to begin, actually. When I tuned in, not caring about the Raiders one way or the other, Kenny Stabler took over. They were fun to watch, and I made a point to keep an eye on them the next year. That year turned into an era, and I must have caught every epochal battle between the two teams. I watched way, way more Raider games that decade than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much sweeter. <p> The Niners got outright whipped, unfortunately. It will be interesting to see how they respond. They snuck up on a lot of teams last year. <p> Went to see the Titans/Lions game today, and met Finnegan 's mother.( he 's a former Titan, I guess she still lives here) The game was pretty well officiated, overall. However, I came home and watched the Denver/Houston game, and Shaub nearly got murdered two plays in a row. I was waiting for a flag. Still waiting, in fact. <p> If I quit doing business with any entity that was aggressively anti-union, I 'd never have to leave the house. Boycotts seldom work. <p> Where the hell are they, and why are these union players crossing the picket line? <p> Hah! This is the union that won real( baseball style) free agency in court, then union president Gene Upshaw( always in the owner 's pocket) gave it back. Hell, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picket line. Football never had a Marvin Miller, and needs one desperately.( And semi-OT, the dunderheads who run the NHL are just as bad.) <p> You know, I no longer think it 's merely tone-deafness, or ineptitude( although both of those things are true). I 've thought for a while, and now with this I completely believe, that Mittens really really does n't want to win, does n't want to be President. I think he wanted the Republican nomination( avenging Daddy?), he got that, and now he 's doing all he can to ensure he does n't win on November 6th. If he were to win, I think he 'd be the most terrified, paralyzed-with-fright person on earth the morning of November 7th. At this point, it just ca n't be an accident that he 's saying stuff like this. <p> @ suzanne : The inability of fans to see that they can collectively influence the owners is baffling. I keep seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that sticking it to the owners might influence things. <p> Denying owners of income from TV revenue, merchandise sales, ticket sales, etc. and shaming are the two types of leverage fans have. Why do they not use it? Watching the games and then whining about it online will do zilch. <p> Mr. Beale was haranguing about the replacement refs in the Titans game today. I missed the play so I do n't know the particulars, but come to think of it he curses the replacement refs ever game we watch. <p> Hard to conjure two teams I like less than Raiders and Steelers, although I 'd have to toss the Cowboys into the cesspool. <p> Nevertheless, JC is right -- the NFL has to place their trustbusting hobby aside and settle with the refs. The owners will be jacking their prices for seven-hundred " really good reasons " they 'll peddle their fleeced fans, so why not make it seven-hundred-one? <p> We fans do n't have the balls, or attention span, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a huge NFL football fan, but one close enough to the edge that the violence of the sport is starting to turn me off. You should n't have a sport where there 's a custom-built vehicle on the sidelines to cart off the maimed( those flat-bed golf carts). As a Rutgers grad, Eric LeGrand is n't really inspiring to me, but mostly tragic. <p> Football 's a great game, but these guys have just gotten too good at fucking each other up. <p> The refs are a disgrace. Watched Bears/Rams and players are clearly taking advantage. Lot of late hits only some of which were called. Watching Ravens/Baltimore which could turn into a complete bloodbath. But I realized today yet another reason why the owners are utterly stupid about this. A couple of " wise guys " at my gym were talking about how the NFL games are all fixed because of all the gambling money and that the fixers are usually the refs. While I do n't believe all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refs and a general air of incompetence, exponentially increases the risk that more people will doubt the integrity of the game or for that matter that games actually will be fixed. Given the effort the NFL puts into addressing internal gambling, this is like having an elaborate security system but leaving the front door open. Actually, and I know this is part of the problem, this Baltimore game is kind of fun, in an old time football way. <p> Capitalist egos and sports do not mix well. Cities with stadiums should eject the teams and start their municipal teams along the same lines as Green Bay. Let the greedy besotted owners build their own stadiums somewhere with their own money. If enough cities did it they could form their own league and their mayors would end up Senators. <p> @ Hill Dweller : Kroft was being Kroft and Pelley was being Pelley. Mitt gave his used car salesman spiel and the President of the United States looked like he was up all night. Oh, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before. <p> @ Pooh : Change is n't easy and people generally have to sacrifice to get results. So you miss some football. Do you want good football with quality refs or not? Changing the system is what is required and has to start somewhere. <p> Personally I do n't care about football one way or the other, so I 'm on the outside looking in. It 's baffling to me that fans ca n't see that together they can influence the situation. Fans have the power. Just imagine if NO ONE watched, say, the next Steelers game. And NO ONE outside of rich people in luxury boxes went to the game. And maybe even outside the stadium fans burned their Steelers jerseys and terrible towels and other gear. All while picketing with " Bring back the real refs " signs and an organized online and social media campaign maybe even punishing advertisers for supporting " purposeful injury to players. " <p> Just imagine the attention that kind of protest would get. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be terrified it would spread to their teams. Fans in other cities would start organizing their own boycotts. <p> It would work. It could work. But fans " do n't want to miss football. " The thing is, they 're missing it already. What they 're watching is n't regular NFL football. What do they have to lose? <p> Yeah, nobody wants to watch footballers suffer &; die( although there appear to be plenty of Republicans who are not so sure about that for old people). Thats why we do n't want them killed while actually playing the game. If they go early because of repeated blows to the head or hobble along with a walker on artificial knees and hips like Jim Otto and so many others or suffer daily pain from compression fractures to the spine they should at least have the decency to do it out of the spotlight where we do n't have to witness it. <p> Given the well known medical problems that result from NFL -level football even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing your outrage John. Modern American football is our version of gladiator matches, we just prefer our expendable fodder to cripple and die off the field instead of on. <p> At least the Romans were honest about their bloodlust. You guys can keep your games, because as long as you keep watching things will never change. <p> @ suzanne : Y'know, suzanne, as someone who has quit watching football specifically because of issues of player safety : Please to be shutting up now. You are making readers less likely to do what you want. You are an antivangelist for your cause. You are bringing people around to your point of view in exactly the same way Fred Phelps is bringing people to Christ : Not. At. All. <p> I do n't have the time or skills to effect a social media campaign, but if someone could get going a twitter feed encouraging boycotting Coors, Bud, and Miller, until the real refs come back, well, you know what would happen... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better to speak on that. Here 's a starter though with the statement of GB 's exemption. As for another league, it 's been tried : check the Wiki on the USFL and you may recall " Arena " football -- neither lasted too long. However my recollection of the the AFC( nee ' AFL) was at one time an independent outfit. Before my
