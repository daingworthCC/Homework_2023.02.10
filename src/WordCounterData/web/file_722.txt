5099341 <h> You Asked -- Republican Insider Responds <p> Proving more than good on their word, RI took time on their own to review the questions of UlstermanReport readers and emailed me their responses. This certainly has made my job much easier! Thank you so much to RI for doing so, and of course, thank you to the many great questions posed by readers to Republican Insider. Here now are their responses to some of your questions : <p> <p> CapitalG Wrote : The GOP never fights back against the media smear machine. We are portrayed as racists but there is nothing in the GOP platform about race. It seems like Republicans in general are largely beyond race as an issue -- which is a sign of TRUE equality. <p> RI : You are totally correct there CapitalG. The Republican Party is n't hung up on race. That is a Democratic Party thing. Unfortunately, the Democrats are given a lot of help by the Mainstream Media in helping to create a portrayal of Republicans that simply is not true. Just look at the most recent convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures who are governors, members of Congress, or high ranking administration officials. Basically where Democrats view individuals on their race, Republicans long ago viewed them on the merits of their character. That is why this new media and sites like Ulsterman 's are so important. And also the help of intelligent and well informed readers like yourself. Republicans need you to stand up to the false portrayals of racism that the Democrats and the media put out there. Just remember though, you have to remain respectful when you do that. Nothing hurts the party more than people calling themselves Republicans who act in a way that only reinforces the negative stereotype. <p> Connor M.L. Wrote : Long time reader, first time commenter. Quick question for Republican Insider. It was mentioned somewhere that you have libertarian leanings. What do you think of the Ron / Rand Paul wing of the Republican party? Are some of their positions more likely to find a place in the party platform now that moderate/liberal Republican candidates have lost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connor! I am pretty familiar with the Libertarian movement in America. At least over the last 10 years or so. I do n't want to speak negatively of any of the more prominent Libertarian leaders, candidates, whatever people want to call them. I 'm very pleased with the leadership of Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is doing a really fantastic job of incorporating simple conservative values back into the GOP. I guess in a way, many of the things people call " libertarian " values today are actually mainstream " conservative " values we saw during the Reagan era. A lot of those values are shared by a Americans who call themselves Republican, Democrat, or Independent. So yes, there is a lot to learn from the Libertarian movement. In fact, on a personal level, I 'm very comfortable describing myself as a " libertarian-leaning Republican ". Less government. Period. <p> Penny Wrote : Did Obama steal the election? Was there voter fraud? And if there was why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was pretty sure this question would come up Penny, and I will do my best to answer you as honestly as possible. I know a lot of people are upset about some of the stories out there about voting percentages and other things of that nature. They have every right to be upset too. Let me just say that to start. So do I think Barack Obama stole the election? I do n't know. I 've read some of what Ulsterman said about it. I noted how his White House Insider pointed to some very specific counties if Florida that are now tied up in a controversy involving Congressman Allen West.( Who I really admire by the way) It certainly seems possible and I can tell you that the subject is being discussed by Republicans. It 's just a matter of how to prove it. A lot of these precincts in question are controlled by Democrats, so it 's not an easy task to find real answers. So is it possible? Yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 2012 election? No. And we may never find out. I wish I could give you a more positive answer but I do n't have the power to force others to tell the truth or admit to a crime. None of us do. If you 're looking for someone to confirm a conspiracy, I 'm not that person. But as for so many people out there who are angry at the possibility there was election fraud, I totally get that. I 'm right there with you. That is why Voter I.D. laws are so important and that is where there are some Republicans and some Democrats saying they are willing to work together to try and come up with a solution. Unfortunately, we have a president right now who wants nothing to do with Voter I.D. laws. Wonder why, huh? <p> Red923 Wrote : I have voted Republican since I was old enough to vote 20+ years ago. I will not vote Republican again unless there are drastic changes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inside and oust the old blood that 's destroying the party? <p> RI : I think your question Red923 really gets to a big problem the Romney campaign ran into this election cycle. There were a lot of Republican voters who for whatever reason, did n't get out and vote. Now I know some are saying that 's not true, that there was election fraud or whatever. I 've gone over the numbers and while there are areas with some odd voter result numbers, overall, the facts do point to a whole lot of Republicans who just did n't vote this time. As a party, we have to ask ourselves why that happened. I 've already made it clear, or tried to make it clear, that I believe it 's because the party has lost its way ideologically. We have to stand up again for basic and easy to communicate conservative principles. Those principles still appeal to a whole lot of Americans. I am convinced they still appeal to the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The right to keep more of what you earn. The party needs to communicate these things much more effectively. People want to feel like their political party is standing up for their values. Republicans have just not done a good enough job of that for some time. That needs to change and I 'm working to make that change happen, and there are more like me who are doing the same. So do n't give up on us just yet Red923. <p> Cnservativemama Wrote : Thank you for considering our questions. I 'll comment on the same line that I made my comments about before, because it really struck a nerve with what I 've noticed in the last two elections. The line you said about bringing Reagan 's playbook to the 21st century. <p> This starts with presenting it to the new generations, with giving them a stance they can be proud of, one they can wear with pride. I think before we can sell the message the right way, we need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious doubts with a lot of the Republicans I see in politics today base their views on true conservative principles. They are not showing themselves to be the party of Ronald Reagan. We need the politicians who ARE. <p> RI : Love the way you put your question Cnservativemama. Your first point is really so important to the future of the party. We must do a better job of appealing to the youth. The next generation of voters. Democrats have done a lot better job of that than we have. Now they have a lot of help in that of course because the media, and pop culture are so biased toward the liberal side. But just like Reagan conservative appealed to so many young people in the 1980? s, I think the Republican Party can do that again. And it starts with the candidates we elect to office, just like you said. " True conservative principles ". Those principles do appeal to a lot of young people if they are presented in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new alternative media thing I keep talking about. Sites like this help to cut through the mainstream media bias, right? It allows someone like me to talk almost directly to someone like you. That kind of thing is so important. Your opinion matters! It really does. For example, let me tell you that I took your entire question along with a few others into a committee meeting just hours after I read it. It was really that good. I sat down with a group of strategists and said " Listen to these people! " And you know what? More and more of us are really starting to listen. I ca n't promise it will happen overnight. I wish it would. But I can promise things are changing inside the Republican Party for the better. <p> USA4ever Wrote : Why wo n't the GOP play to win, cutthroat style, like the Dems always do? What are the chances Obama is impeached for Benghazi, et al.? Does Boehner, McConnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least and want them removed? Is there any Republican in Congress willing to tell Obama and Jarrett to shove it? <p> RI : I do n't believe Republicans need to lower themselves to the patheticly low standard Democrats have set. We just need to go back to basic conservative principles and that will win elections. If you want the party to cheat, lie, and steal, I 'm not the one to talk to. Now regarding Benghazi, there is a whole lot there that has n't come out yet and I 'm going to leave it at that, ok? Let 's see what the process uncovers and then decide if we are satisfied with the outcome. I will say that impeachment of a president is very unlikely. If that is not the answer you want I 'm sorry, but as I 've already promised many times, I 'm not here to satisfy people 's hunger for conspiracies. I will tell you the truth though, so hopefully that appeals to the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not going to get personally negative on a fellow Republican. I will say that I 've already made it clear on my feelings that the Republican leadership in its current form is not representing conservative values nearly as well as it needs to and leave it at that. For now. Finally, I do n't feel any need to tell President Obama or Valerie Jarrett to " shove it ". I do feel the need to make sure their brand of progressive socialism does n't extend beyond another four years. The 2014 midterms are going to be a big help in making sure that does n't happen. <p> Tamminator Wrote : What plan do the Republicans have to stop massive regulations from being implemented under Obama? Oh, and will you tell the Republicans to stop CAVING on things? Fight Obama on EVERYTHING. Show the conservative side that you mean business, and we will VOTE FOR YOU. <p> RI : We need a very strong showing in 2014 Tamminator. Imagine if Republicans had not lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? All of Barack Obama 's agenda, or at least a whole lot of it, would not have been implemented like it was. That includes Obamacare of course. So, if you want to stop Barack Obama and his administration from throwing down a whole bunch more regulations then we need the votes to stop it, or repeal it. That means we need conservative Republicans to win in 2014. That 's what I 'm working very hard now to try and do, but I need the help of people like you. Talk to everyone you know and take just a little time here and there to explain what real conservative values are. Keep it simple, and people will listen. Maybe not all of them but some of them will. When you compare conservatism to liberalism, conservatism wins almost every time. <p> Bunny Wrote : My first question is : Has anyone... ANYONE... in the GOP noticed that the issue of abortion or as the liberals like to say ' A woman 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 4 years and then dropped like a hotcake after the national election? <p> RI : Like the way you think Bunny! You have the mind of a good political strategist! I 100% agree with what you are saying here. Just look at the Tea Party movement that was so influential during the 2010 midterms. It was n't social issues that made up the Tea Party nearly as much as it was basic conservative economic principles and the idea none of us want a big centralized government telling us what to do with our own healthcare. It 's about liberty. So topics like abortion or immigration, those are things Democrats use to " muddy the waters ". This time around it was the fake " war on women ". The sad thing is it worked because the Republican Party allowed it to work. There was far too little discipline inside the party and between the candidates and we have to work to prevent that from happening again. Personally, I find the current president 's views on abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a president so willing to kill a life outside the womb as this president is. Republicans had a way to present those facts in a clear way that I think would have been very effective, but they did n't do it. Part of that was we had a national candidate whose own past views on the subject were unfortunately, contradictory and so I think their campaing took it off the table. And notice how the media did not want to raise the issue once the primaries were over. Liberals know that if the subject of abortion is presented truthfully, Democrats suffer. The position that Barack Obama holds on the issue is not about a woman 's right to choose. Barack Obama supports killing a child that is a living breathing human being outside of the mother 's womb. The fact that such a man was not elected once but now twice as President of the United States makes me very worried. <p> bill o'rights Wrote : If we are to assume that the Progressives are Marxists -- Marxists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not also assume they have done so within the Republican Party? And, if so, would you characterize the RINOs in D.C. as closet Progressives? <p> RI : I would characterize Republicans who do n't actually support basic conservative values of liberty, freedom, free markets, and self determination as being better suited to joining the current Democratic Party. Hope that makes my position clear enough to you. <p> <p> Link to all the questions originally posed to Republican Insider found here : <p> The fact that we have a dialogue here is a very positive step. But we need to discuss concretes and forge a meaningful plan, with consensus. We must explore every possible solution and there 's no time left to piss around. <p> I would add that I 've begun dedicating the whole of my life to this cause, at a time when I really ca n't personally afford to throw care to the wind and quit my day job -- which is essentially what I 've now done. <p> As I see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway, if we ca n't fundamentally restore our nation. If we are not yet understanding this, then we have n't been reading enough. <p> I have to agree with you L/O. I notice that if RI reviewed all questions submitted, it is quite telling that they opted not to answer any eligibility/criminaltiy questions. Election fraud? Meh. Whatever. " Finally, I do n't feel any need to tell President Obama or Valerie Jarrett to " shove it ". We just need to change the way they think. Now get out there and vote, vote, vote. <p> In reference to eligibility, RI may not have the legal knowledge to understand and comprehend the eligibility issue. However, Barack Obama is definitely not eligible to be president. That is a fact of law and the law has not changed in recent years. But, these judges are wimps who would rather shy away from this issue! They will not touch it in an honesty manner because it means a risk to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth through justice, is in decline. <p> @Kay112-He/she does not need any legal knowledge to just answer why congress will not address it. S/he did the exact same thing as SCOTUS and just ignored it. I would like an acknowledgment at least that it is a question. Thanks for your input. <p> I could n't agree more with Luxuryoption and SallyAl. Part of the problems with Republicans is they do not understand who they are facing. They literally think that just because the other side is slashing and burning they just need to come with a dignified argument and no need to get dirty. Sorry, we are so past that point that it 's delusional to really believe such bull crap as rousing the troops, getting out and voting for Republicans is going to save anything. <p> You need to do more than to tell Jarret and Obama to shove it. You need to get those frauds, liars, and lawbreakers out of office. But you see, Republican Insider is a Tiny Man just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men left to lead us and I for one will not continue to be herded by the small men over the cliff making sure not to get dirty. If you are not aware of it, it 's already a civil war and you ca n't stay clean if you want to win. Do I mean you need to cheat? No, but you need to catch, prosecute and impose justice on the other side which you are unwilling to do. <p> You had better go back and start rethinking things in a big way other wise I will never vote for the Party again and I 'm more than sure others wo n't either. This is all the same bull crap we were told before this election. If you want repeal of obamacare and to stop his agenda vote Republican Rah Rah! Yeah right. <p> Your comment hits the nail on the head and really speaks to my doubts. The Democratic party is no longer the party of ' if it feels good do it. What people fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardcore Marxists. <p> If " whoop ass " is too vulgar for yeh, RI, about butt-kicking, heiney-whoopin ', a little ferocity, er, dare I say manliness? I mean as a party, mind you, since I do n't know you personally, and do want to say thank you for your insights. <p> I too, am skeptical. Sounds like the same platitudes and empty rhetoric that we 've been spoon-fed over the last two election cycles with the only shift in the electorate being decidedly toward the left( a result of all those freebies from the government, no doubt). I do n't think we need more cheer-leading so much as we need real conservative leadership on those issues that we just continue to " dance " around. We do n't need another candidate who masquerades as a conservative to get through the primaries only to become tongue-tied when attempting to articulate true conservative principles and vision in the general election. What about Fast &; Furious? What about Solyndra? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about the Arpaio investigation? What about Muslim Brotherhood influence in the White House? And so the list goes. All this ammunition ; none of it used to our advantage. Tell us why not? And yeah, I 'm bitter and I 'm pissed. Got anything of substance to tell us? Same ol ', same ol ' with Boehner, McConnel, Priebus, et al? C'm on man, throw us a bone and make it juicy ; and then make it happen. <p> And just a bit ago, Grahamnesty was in Vannity and said again he would not support Rice for SoS. But that he usually does support whoever the pres appoints because " they serve at the pleasure of the president " and basically it is his right to have who he wants. Do these people not understand that the reason the appointees need to be confirmed is to make sure( HA!) that the appointee is the appropriate person for the job( not just " uniquely qualified ") and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being so willing and open with your time and thoughts, RI -- enjoyed reading them. <p> It 's clear that the Tea Party did n't have the same enthusiasm to GOTV in 2012 as in 2010, for a variety of reasons( disappointing performance of those elected in 2010, Romney as the candidate in 2012, etc.). <p> Question : Do you see any movement within the Republican Party to embrace the Tea Party, eventually to the point of having Tea Party conservatives in leadership positions in both houses of Congress? If not, what would you foresee as the necessary conditions to create such a movement? <p> This was awesome to read! Thank you RI for taking the time to answer these questions. If more republicans did this kind of thing they would win a whole lot more elections IMO. Loved almost every one of these answers. <p> To RI, I was n't suggesting to win elections by cheating as Dems do. I 'm simply saying that they 're driven to win to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know this). The GOP needs its own brand of " will to win ". Where 's the party 's competitive fire? You need conservatism AND the passion to win with conservatism to succeed. <p> On Benghazi -- if Obama and his cohorts are n't held accountable in a real way( resignations, impeachment, what have you) then what 's the point of going through another D &; P show like Fast and Furious? Obama is getting away with literally everything he does. If the puss GOP leadership is n't serious about standing for justice and the law, then please do n't bother with the dress rehearsal. Not interested in that. <p> I 'm deeply concerned that you 're in the state of mind that elections swing back and forth, and that you 're banking on " conservatism " magically winning the day again and all will be well. Well, despite Romney 's lack of conservative bona fides, he was still more than a viable candidate against someone like Obama and we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservatism is about empowering people to become their best self. Why choose that when Liberalism promises to do everything for them short of a breathing machine? <p> And one more thing : Obama committed voting fraud and stole this election but looks like the GOP wants to Hear/See/Speak No Evil on that one. <p> " Let 's see what the process uncovers and then decide if we are satisfied with the outcome. I will say that impeachment of a president is very unlikely. If that is not the answer you want I 'm sorry, but as I 've already promised many times, I 'm not here to satisfy people 's hunger for conspiracies. " <p> We ca n't wait for an " outcome " on this matter. We wait, the Dems stonewall and succeed to sweeping it under the carpet. It 's that simple. <p> And with all due respect and appreciation, there is no Benghazi conspiracy. The Obama Administration is running guns to Al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and other jihadists to forment revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And now Obama is in the process of covering it up, just like everything else he gets away with. <p> If you and the GOP( save for maybe Gowdy and Chaffetz) can't/wo n't see that, then the Republic is already dead and with it the GOP. <p> Amen also. I posted another one but disappeared -- UM -- trouble again. Yes -- and re " conspiracy " -- I am soooooo.... tired of those that always say they do n't believe in them &; connect it to " lies " &; mean rhetoric or something. No -- it 's about TRUTH -- there will always be " conspiracies " -- colluding to deceive others in order to gain wealth, power, control, fame. We are talking about the truth behind what the real agenda is with Obama and his friends.... what are their intentions in connection with their known ideologies, factual policies and connections, etc. All facts. This needs to be exposed &; dealt with in order to save our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who swore to uphold the Constitution -- remember? What of the VERY long list of the unconstitutional acts of Obama???? NOTHING is done. Unfortunately, I guess that was asking too much......... <p> IMO, you are n't going to gain any new voters with the ' smaller government ' argument at this point. The phrase ' going back ' is n't going to work for them. They do n't get it. And it 's too easy for the Left to use that against us. It 's too easy for them to twist the ' going back ' into their stupid Women 's Rights and Racism arguments. The new generations are being brought up on Big Government freebies. They do n't remember Reagan. They do n't know what it was like to make your own choices and deal with consequences. This is going to have to be explained in detail... what Liberty really means... and how it will affect their lives. They need to understand that the Federal government should not grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have the right to be free, and turning over more power to the government only ends up restricting our choices. They might like the restrictions now because it does n't affect them( because they are told it only affects some old, rich, white guy they do n't know), but I do n't think they truly understand that this power does n't reset after 4 or 8 years. And the next guy in office might not have the same ideology as they do. But by the time they realize that, it 's going to be too late. The power has been granted and it 's near impossible to undo. It seems as though we now have 2 choices. We can choose to live with the parent who makes us follow their rules, BUT gives us stuff( cell phones, car, etc.), or the parent who wants to make us follow their rules, and maybe puts a little in a savings account that the other parent drains every few years. Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my government, and would prefer to have them out of the way so I can provide for myself. <p> If the Republican Party truly wants to ' go back ' to the days of smaller government and more personal freedom, then we need to be showing the new generations what they means and how much better life is when you get to decide what your life will look like, and without the government micromanaging everything. <p> IMO, you are n't going to gain any new voters with the ' smaller government ' argument at this point.

I like it. Like it a lot. If the repubs can be saved this is the kind of guy who can do it. I 'll echo what another one said. If this guy were running they would have my vote. Really like how they explain things. Good job! <p> Tough crowd today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that passing notes along from here will make a difference. Ha! With all due respect, that 's completely preposterous. It 's like giving crime tips to a corrupt police department. The good people of this country will act from outside both party establishments and save it. Will not be pleasant or easy, but it will work. Just keep smiling and nodding to these politicos, while going above their heads. They have a need to feel important. That 's fine... satiate it -- it will keep them placated and hopefully inactive as possible. <p> I mean, come one -- here we are in 2012 after a disastrous election and all we 're getting is the same platitudes about Reagan? I like Reagan as much as the next one, but do you recall Reagan harping on incessantly about Calvin Coolidge? Me neither. <p> No, the best way to praise Reagan is to act like him. That is, go out and change things. Stem the tide. To put it another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! ' " <p> As I said in another response, many of the people who profess to want to " go back to Reagan " either do n't know, do n't remember, or do n't care what Reagan actually stood for. <p> They just seem to be impressed by the Reagan charisma, while remaining ignorant of Reagan 's actual policies. Like it or not, one of the closest( though inferior) administrations to Reagan 's in terms of real policy was that of Bush 43. <p> I like the polite approach to a point. But there comes a time when you might just have to stop talking and start punching. Hope this Republican Insider is able to do that. Not that WHI had the balls to do that either. Seems like he ran away when the shit really hit the fan after Romney lost. And count me in as tired of all the conspiracy crap that some people like to throw out there. Grow up people. Lock and load and STFU. Got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Racists. Pigs. It might have been a cool place to hang back in the Reagan dayz, but now its just full of losers and slaves to the machine. Dems got everyone else. That why Obama wins even though he sucked ass as prez. He sucked but the GOP sucks more. You all gave some guy who wears magig undies the nomination. Shit. For real? And look at the comments in this house. People getting all up in the conspiracy this and that. Dumb white racist asshat wearing nutless faggot hating breeders. We are black and brown and male and female and gay and straight and we rule up in this house now yo! So pack it up and move to Canada where all the cold dumb white faggot hating breeders go to die. Peace. <p> I 'm on the Illinois Libertarian Republican list. The topic of abortion comes up frequently. In this bit I posted to the list I explain to a member of the list why the abortion question( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) is an electoral loser. <p> ========== <p> Ah. But that is your problem with winning elections on the matter. Although abortion is abhorrent to 2/3rds of Americans and fits the definition of premeditated murder, most abortion foes treat it like misdemeanor manslaughter and the woman( the initiator of the crime) goes free. <p> Now if you are serious -- " abortion is murder " then you must at minimum give the woman and her accomplice life sentences. For consistency. <p> Odds are you fall into the mainstream of abortion foes and shudder at giving women life sentences for the crime. And if you were to come out in favor of charging it like murder one then you would see Rs lose even bigger on the issue. <p> And then you are up against the Orthodox Jews who consider abortion a REQUIREMENT if competent authorities declare the woman 's mental health in danger. How will you accommodate them? <p> If I was a Republican candidate I 'd say something like this -- " I abhor abortion. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay out of it. I do support xxx organization which helps women who are considering abortion. " Since the demise of Rockford Pro-Life I know of no organization which supports women considering abortion and which does not also favor making it an issue of law. <p> Now think of it from a woman 's perspective if it is a law. She is then a target of surveillance from the government from ages 10 to 55. Why would a woman vote for that? Anyone can look at the results of the Drug War to see where that leads -- regular pregnancy tests( urine samples) to make sure the law is n't being violated. What woman would want that? <p> You ca n't have small government and an anti-abortion regime. <p> So now you have government in control of the vaginas. What if some evil Democrat gets in and declares those vaginas are producing too many babies? You have the enforcement apparatus already in place. It just needs a small change in focus. You only think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ". I 'm an engineer I think, " What can go wrong? " Basically you have the same problem alcohol foes had in 1920. They only thought of the matter in the context of " if every one obeys the law our alcohol problems will be a thing of the past. " You can do anything you want with laws except make Americans obey them. <p> And then you have the problem of miscarriage. Every one will have to be dealt with as a potential abortion. Tell me what woman would want to be a target of a murder investigation because of something( a natural process) she has no control over. <p> I can see it is not clear in your mind why with 65% to 70% support Americans do n't want a law. I hope I have clarified the issue for you. And if not? Well keep promoting your favorite candidates and keep losing elections. I can live under socialism and will do well who ever is in power. The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for answering our questions, RI. I respect that even if I think we have moved far beyond Republican business-as-usual. The times that we are living in require new, radical tactics. I 'm afraid going to back to the Reagan way is not an option when most on the Left have no respect for Reagan anyway. We have to forge a new way while still remaining true to conservatism. <p> Ah. But the left does like their personal liberty. No need to conjure ghosts. <p> An appeal to personal liberty( not just economic liberty) might peel off enough votes to win elections. We have 70% to 80% of the population favoring med pot and over 50% favoring marijuana legalization. <p> The question is : how do you get those votes without making the socons of the party crazy? I do n't have an answer to that. But leaving those issues up to the states might work. <p> If what you say is so why did the Republicans of December 1914 oppose the Harrison Narcotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progressive Republicans of today. For another they were of the opinion that Prohibition was not a power granted to the Federal Government by the Constitution. You are probably a Constitutionalists in name only. <p> And further We know that decrim in Portugal has cut drug use in half. How does that fit your mental model? I think your mental model is deficient. <p> And how did America survive for over 100 years with legal opiates? And over a hundred and fifty years with legal cannabis? <p> Well OK. You do n't want those votes. The Democrats do. What do you think the results of that will be? Can you do well under socialism? I hope so. Because the socialists will be courting the votes you do n't want. <p> There are some fundamental flaws in ideology that people are picking up on here, but if we can share knowledge, I 'm certain we can iron them out, if all of us approach this with open minds. <p> The individuals who follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You offer inside knowledge and experience. We 're all going to have to take a few things on faith. <p> For my part, I can certainly understand any doubts you may have. I get that. But this is not a forum on Area 51 and alien conspiracies. You see a little of that stuff once in a while, but you weigh everything. In other words, it 's O.K. to keep the filter on, but set it on instinct mode, not all-or-none. <p> Perfect example : <p> Many of the agent provacateur and conspiracy websites contain articles about the Department of Homeland Security 's acquisition of 1.8 billion rounds of ammunition since Obama took office. Conspiracy right? <p> Wrong. I have copies of the contract documents -- from right off the governments servers, as do many others. <p> At any rate, if we battle each other on the granular, we 're spinning our wheels. Frankly, I think it will just divide us more. <p> This was really cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly w/o even being asked about it. Really hope they keep it up. The country needs to have a lot more of these discussions. I am a first generation American born. Parents of immigrants. I vote Republican most of the time but there are parts of the party that really need to be improved. Messaging stuff. I like this insiders views a lot. Like reading my mind. Really good stuff. Ready for more! <p> Dude! Where 's my posting? Are we returning to the old days of censorship? By the way, I was n't exactly positive about the RI answers... No answer on the establishment/Bush, no answer on immigration. the signs are not good, my friends... <p>... It seems that the Republican Party needs to do some more soul searching. First, RI, we need to understand each other 100%. Many Republicans and Leaning Republican people sat out for a variety of reasons, and my experience indicates this is from lack of representation from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and 6 consisting of " CapitalG Wrote : The GOP never fights back against the media smear machine. We are portrayed as racists but there is nothing in the GOP platform about race... " <p> " USA4ever Wrote :... Does Boehner, McConnell, Cantor know we true conservatives ca n't stand them in the least and want them removed? <p> RI, your respective answers were summarily were : " Unfortunately, the Democrats are given a lot of help by the Mainstream Media in helping to create a portrayal of Republicans that simply is not true. " " Republicans need you to stand up to the false portrayals of racism that the Democrats and the media put out there. " <p> " Now on " Boehner, McConnell, Cantor " I am not going to get personally negative on a fellow Republican. I will say that I 've already made it clear on my feelings that the Republican leadership in its current form is not representing conservative values nearly as well as it needs to and leave it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First and foremost, when someone runs for public office, you are rather expected to show how you intend to represent us as a populace to earn our consent of the masses or governed. While your political unity prospective of not putting down fellow Republicans is admirable, you also already contradicted yourself. Republican Defenders look more like Republican Apologists when Republican candidates are attacked by a charge of racism, and our Republican candidate shrugs off the charge leaves Republican Defenders aptly defenseless against ' If it were n't true, why did n't the Party debunk the charge '. RI, the question was quite simple while the media does indeed aid Democrats in these charges ; Republicans often shy away from the confrontational charge effectively rendering the charge very difficult to dismantle to non-Republican and leaning Republican people. Look at the two questions and answers, was this meant to give such a strong impression of that Republicans like us are forced to defend the nearly indefensible because we 're left hanging by the rest of the party? <p> Second, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't Republicans do something about it? " <p> " It certainly seems possible and I can tell you that the subject is being discussed by Republicans. It 's just a matter of how to prove it. A lot of these precincts in question are controlled by Democrats, so it 's not an easy task to find real answers. " <p> So, The issue is under discussion, but it 's not presently provable making it unlikely for Republicans to press the issue. <p> " Unfortunately, we have a president right now who wants nothing to do with Voter I.D. laws. " <p> I note that President Obama did n't win a single state that enforces a strict ID Photo policy to ensure you are who you say you are, and the Brennan Study that is a legality firm who receives much funding from George Soros whose Study 's own footnotes greatly contradict disenfranchises minorities as untrue. This ties into question 1 addressed by RI. <p> " Tamminator Wrote : What plan do the Republicans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " RI : We need a very strong showing in 2014 Tamminator. " <p> Why are the Republicans then campaigning for 2014 when there are pressing issues to handle between then and now? <p> RI, I realize that you probably wo n't respond to these items, but they did strike me compelling to ask at the very least. <p> Got ta admit I am a bit stunned and disappointed with RI 's response. They admit we get labelled as racist -- but hey let 's leave it to the grassroots to fight that fight. Meanwhile Hollywood 's big megaphone shouts ' RACIST ' at the entire lot of us. <p> I am simply not willing to fight for a party that wo n't fight back on it 's own. I 'm ready to support a 3rd party -- not fight for a party that refuses to fight for itself. <p> If they do n't have a plan to attack the Democrats racial division and remind them of their racist past EVERY TIME an accusation is made then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news conference for the 19th time during the month denouncing some commentators divisive racial commentary and reminding them once again of Democrat looooong history of racial oppression I think the slurs will stop. Eyes might even get opened along the way. <p> Just wanted to say goodbye " Ulsterman " I have enjoyed the drama marketing for the Rebloodlican party but at last I must say ado. You have proven with this new " insider " how this is no less smoke and mirrors that the current administrations explanation on Benghazi. Both gangs want nothing more than to keep THEIR flow of OUR dollars. To modify Forrest Gump. Dispicable is as dispicable does. <p> Another question re Benghazi gate : We asked the question why did Bill go all out to help Obama get reelected? We all had no answers. I think I have the answer. <p> The Clintons needed Obama 's help to protect Hillary from the fall out of Benghazi. Now Obama has been reelected he could use the power of the presidency, a compliant MSM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out. Hillary has not fronted. Rice maybe dumb or maybe Obama promised her the position of secretary of state! It all fits together. The GOP is too dumb to figure this out. They are focusing their anger on Obama and Rice. Hillary is getting away with murder. Hillary wants to protect her legacy to run for POTUS in 2016. <p> The tragedy is they are likely to get away with it. <p> The GOP in the house will screw up the investigation. The senate will protect their guys. Susan Rice will become secretary of state even though there will be much resistance in the senate. Obama will take a bit of heat but so what. Hillary will run for POTUS in 2016. <p> I agree. Let 's get this ball rolling with RI. Let 's start pasting links here for RI 's benefit. 100+ precincts in Ohio throwing their vote at Obama by 99% or greater... St. Lucie County 's 100+% voter participation... same in Colorado... 14 precincts in Philly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, resulting in 99% vote for Obama in 13 of the 14. <p> Note to RI : <p> The line between conspiracy theorists and realist is a thin one... particularly at times like these. <p>.... and let 's not forget Wisconsin which, in early reporting was 55/43 Romney while the networks were calling WI for O and then an hour and a half later, numbers suddenly tilted sharply to O. <p> Might that have been the result of reports received from WI voters who said cars and buses with IL plates were unloading passengers who made no secret of where they came from or that they were there to vote. One Wi voter said the person in front of her complained about the line moving too slowly -- " I got ta get back to Chicago tonight ". <p> RI : " Do I know for certain there was " stealing " of the 2012 election? No. And we may never find out. " <p> Hardly breaking news. It 's what we 've been getting and actually expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking their heads in the sand, they give some consideration to the view they present to the rest of the world. <p> I did n't read anything showing about " sticking head in the sand ".???? I read a good factual answer. Could there have been fraud? Yes. Can we prove it for sure? That is a lot tougher thing to do. Especially because the democrats have been doing it for years and have it down to a science. That early voting stuff was fishy. We do need good Voter ID just like the republican insider says. All of this sniping makes me wonder if its Obama operators coming in here and just killing off any
