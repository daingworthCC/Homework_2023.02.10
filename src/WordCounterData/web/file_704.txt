5097541 <h> Insurance gap needs to be filled <p> Many people who could use additional auto insurance protection may not find that out until it 's too late. They would have a better chance of not facing that gap if the governor approves legislation encouraging, although not requiring, drivers to choose to buy greater liability insurance. <p> The bill, sponsored by the chairmen of the insurance committees, Sen.
