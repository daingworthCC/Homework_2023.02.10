I would n't say that midwesterners are stupid, but many that I came across were quite ignorant, often willfully. But I 'd take that over the utter pretention of the west coast any day.... <p> Re : do people think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, I 'm from the east coast but I 've lived in the midwest and on the west coast, so I have at least some perspective.
