Risks and repercussions are never fully weighed. People leap and almost always land on rocky ground. May-December romances flourish in these stories, as do self-doubt and, in many cases, serious regret. Mysterious, dangerous benefactors, dead and living artists, movie stars and college professors, plagiarists, and distinguished foreign novelists are among the many different characters. No one is blameless, but villains are difficult to single out-everyone seemingly bears responsibility for his or her desires and for the outcome of difficult choices so often made hopefully and naively. <p> The ten stories in this striking debut collection examine the perils of love and what it means to live during an era when people will offer themselves, almost unthinkingly, to strangers.

Ten finely delineated tales featuring protagonists entangled in less-than-ideal romantic scenarios constitute this year 's winner of the Grace Paley Prize. The best stories feature women caught up in liaisons with men either much younger or older. In " Quality of Life, " a 26-year-old woman begins seeing a wealthy man more than double her age, Mr. Fulger, who takes her out infrequently and presses money on her, which she takes because it " made her life more easeful. " She dates other men her age, but ca n't seem to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the title story, the granddaughter of a late, famous artist becomes involved with a young artist who may be playing her to obtain the precious notebooks bequeathed to her. Teetering on the brink of self-possession, Sneed 's protagonists are n't sure they trust themselves, such as the 55-year old narrator of " By the Way " who ca n't admit to her much younger lover her fears of faltering memory and mortality.

All rights reserved. <p> Sneed 's first collection was awarded the Grace Paley Prize in Short Fiction, an honor clearly deserved given the lucidity of her style, the depth of her perception, and her supple mix of wit, frankness, and compassion. Beautifully interiorized, her provocative stories explore unbalanced relationships, particularly between men and women of differing ages. Sneed also has a rare gift for convincingly articulating the sensations and emotions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soul-killing arrangement between an elusive older man and a young woman, while a 55-year-old woman, a dancer, in love with a 35-year-old man, confronts the avalanche of fears age delivers. The volatile chemistry of fame and envy stokes the finely textured title story, which portrays a disaffected young woman confounded by the complications following the death of her grandfather, a renowned artist ; a delectably unsettling tale about a successful screenwriter at her high-school reunion ; and a masterfully counterintuitive story about an English professor and a movie star and his bodyguard. With a surprisingly futuristic and funny closing story, this is an exceptionally smart, connective, and moving collection. --Donna Seaman <h> More About the Author <p> Christine Sneed is the author of Portraits of a Few of the People I 've Made Cry, a 2009 AWP Grace Paley Prize winner, a finalist for the 2010 Los Angeles Times Book Award( first-fiction category), winner of the 2011 John C.

It 's not that I 'm not interested in the genre, and it 's not that I do n't cherish a really beautifully executed short story. I think it 's just that outside of reading them for college classes, I do n't seek out short stories. Like most readers these days, I 'm drawn to the longer narrative, the familiarity of the same characters painted on page after page of a long story. Perhaps it 's laziness, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, characters, and situation every ten or twenty pages. It 's easier to continue lingering in a world of the familiar with the novel. <p> How much Christine Sneed 's book has changed my opinion of what a short story collection can accomplish. This book was so engrossing, so easily addicting, that I found myself very quickly slipping into the world of each of the new characters. This book made me nearly miss my train stop one morning. Sneed 's characters speak so uniquely and confessionally that they easily take form and start leading the reader into their worlds. Within one or two pages of each new story I found myself quickly acclimating to the new climate of the story and feeling the tug of believable, human, and understandable tension. While all of the voices in " Portraits " are female, I was so astounded at how different they each were--young, menopausal, insecure, frustrated, hopeful to a fault--and how relatable. I 'm in my late twenties, trying to find a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it so interesting that I felt such a connection to the protagonist in the story, " By the Way. " Even though she 's in her late fifties, divorced, close to wrapping up her career as a dance teacher, this woman 's voice reached out deeply into my own experience. I could understand her fears, her insecurities, her hopes, as if they were my own. I was astounded that Sneed could create character after character that could speak so honestly about the human experience, and yet each character was so remarkably different and believably drawn. <p> I will turn to this book again and again not just because it is a joy to read, but because it will serve as an excellent example for my own writing. <p> And Just as I think it 's perhaps a bit lazier to read a novel, I imagine that it might be a bit easier to write one. Only once does the author conceive the main characters and begin to build the world of conflict around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer is asked to find a voice for their players, and set them in a new and interesting situation. And several times the author must swiftly and deftly dig her character 's out of the mess she 's sunk them in. Sneed does this so poetically and effortlessly she has truly given me a new appreciation for the short story. And she 's written a collection that speaks of larger themes of love, helplessness, and resurrection that bind the stories together in that satisfying feel of a novel. I already ca n't wait for her next collection. <p> As an avid reader, I 've come across works that are both engrossing and lackluster, and " Portraits " is easily one of the most spell-binding and memorable works that I 've come across in a long time. Not having been captivated as much by a set of short stories since reading Munro or O'Connor, her work was a true delight to absorb. Sneed conveys so much passion and wisdom in such elegant fashion that I greatly look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live life without stepping on a few people along the way. " Portraits of a Few of the People I 've Made Cry " is a collection of stories from Christine Sneed telling stories of people living carelessly, where harsh repercussions are very real. From poor decisions in romance, to risks taken in the search for greater success, and more. The human experience and the regret and doubt that come make for a collection of stories that proves very enticing and hard to put down. " Portraits of a Few of the People I 've Made Cry " is an all-out excellent
