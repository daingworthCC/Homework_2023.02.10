5078141 <h> 10 Things Americans Say... and What They Really Mean <p> When it comes to the spoken word, Americans are a truly baffling bunch. So we 've decoded their most irritating idioms. <p> 1. When an American shop assistant says, " Have a nice day! " Translation : " Honestly, I do n't care what kind of day you have. But please tell my manager I was friendly so I get extra commission. " Definitely does n't mean : " I will sob myself to sleep if I subsequently learn that you had a less than adequate day. " <p> 2. When an American you 've just met says, " Let 's have lunch sometime. " Translation : " Let 's never ever eat a meal together. " Definitely does n't mean : " I urgently need to see you put food in your mouth. " <p> 3. When an American friend says, " I hooked up with... " Translation : " I had sex with/kissed/hung out with... " Definitely does n't mean : " I attached myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When American parents say, " Good job! " Translation : " Hey! Everyone! My two-year-old is a genius because he split an infinitive, then corrected himself! Also, he went pee-pee in the potty. " Definitely does n't mean : " Excellent career choice. Well done son. " <p> 5. When a drunken American says, " I 'm actually Irish. " Translation : " My great great grandfather was part Irish. Or at least that 's what I heard. " Definitely does n't mean : " I 'm Irish. " <p> 6. When a sarcastic American says, " You do the math. " Translation : " Work it out, fish brain. " Definitely does n't mean : " Please do some long division immediately. " <p> 7. When an annoying American says, " Your shirt is so cute! " Translation : " That 's one good looking upper body garment, be it a vest top, a t-shirt or an actual bona fide shirt -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean : " I 'm sexually attracted to your blouse. " <p> I 've lived in AZ for just over a year now, and my husband &; I still giggle at our lingo barriers <p> Jelene <p> We spend 2-months a year in England and after the first week, we 're speaking YOUR English! Wheelie bins, kitchen roll, loo roll, spanners, etc.... it 's such a hoot! Cheers to our differences, I love all of them!!! And welcome to the USA, I hope you are having a lovely time! <p> http : **30;798;TOOLONG Amy Collins <p> And do n't get me started on Fanny Farmer Candy! <p> Lisa <p> I have never ever ever used the term fanny. Bum, butt, booty( with my kids and rarely!), rear, backside, but FANNY????? <p> Emma <p> I had my 20 week scan 4 weeks ago, found out it 's a boy &; my mother in law said " I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told it was a boy! LOL <p> We refer to those stupid belt pouches all the time as Fanny Packs.. totally different meaning in UK <p> Jelene <p> Mostly mothers of small children use the word fanny, i.e., I 'm going to smack your fanny if you run out in the road without looking.... <p> http : **30;830;TOOLONG? id=1... Jennifer Burnham <p> Er, a " Fanny " is not a backside. It 's a lady 's squishy bits. <p> Emma <p> Exactly! thank you! <p> http : **30;862;TOOLONG? id=1... Jennifer Burnham <p> Oh sorry. I thought you were American 's talking about British slang. Got it completely turned around. <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> Only old ladies say fanny <p> Zo 's Mum <p> You mean a butt/ass? We do n't say fanny at all. <p> http : **31;894;TOOLONG Chet Carman <p> " Bitchin ' " <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> no one has said Bitchin ' since about 1987 <p> http : **31;927;TOOLONG Chet Carman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah... cause when British people say ' You alright? ' when you 're in a shop, they 're really concerned about you and not how they can sell you things... And ' ta ' is totally a thing that means ' Thank you. ' And ' pissed ' means ' drunk, ' and not ' angry ' but in either places rarely means ' covered in urine. ' Did you get paid to write this...? <p> Me <p> If I got that offended over that kind of thing, I would have a very unhappy life. <p> Ethan Gilbert <p> American here -- Why would someone be offended by this? But you did miss the boat on " Bless your heart! " Means : You seem mentally retarded to me. Does NOT Mean : God keep you in good cardiovascular health. <p> Marilyn <p> " Bless her/his heart " usually proceeds a " but, " and then the diss. Yes, I do that, here in one of the middle states. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the polite way of ending an insult. " She ca n't help being stupid, but she does n't have to open her mouth. Bless her heart. " <p> Jamie <p> My grandmother( a Southern gal) always said " Bless your/her/his heart, " and not in that sense, nor with a " diss " added on. She used it all the time in a positive context, i.e : " you 're adorable. " <p> Kim Morgan <p> Yeah, I live in the South and this is one of my least favorite phrases. It usually is n't malintentioned( I think I just made up a word), but there is a condescending nature to it. <p> The use of the word restroom amuses me. I 've actually seen Americans flinch if you ask where the toilet is. And the Americans I 've met seriously hate any kind of swearing. <p> Tstys913 <p> Well, I do n't know what Americans you have been talking to but I live in America and am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation. I also do n't use the word restroom, ever. We have different people here just like you do in the UK, each have differing nuances of speech. <p> Moeyknight <p> You 're correct. Americans have many more regional differences than Britain because it 's so much larger. And we all swear except maybe my grandmother. <p> http : **35;960;TOOLONG... Missy Gustavsson <p> i am american born and i love swearing!! <p> RogueSquid <p> A friend of mine is terrified of saying toilet, or anything that references ' pee ', so she has to say restroom haha. But, I do n't mind loo or bathroom. <p> http : **35;997;TOOLONG Sandra Little Rabinowitz <p> Once upon a time in America, there were actually rest rooms in large department stores, where ladies could take a break from shopping, freshen their makeup, etc. there were couches and comfy chairs and countertops with stools for these purposes. Beyond the rest room were the toilets. Now you know. <p> lindsey <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores in NJ. And also in the casinos there is a sitting room with a counter and mirror and chairs before the actual toilets and sinks and such. <p> http : **30;1034;TOOLONG Heather Blank <p> HAH I love swearing! <p> http : **33;1066;TOOLONG Brain Lock <p> I usually use " bathroom " with the occasional " I got ta hit the head ", meaning I have to whiz so bad my back teeth are floating! " Seeing a man about a horse " or other animal does not mean he is headed to the pet store/zoo/farm to purchase said animal. <p> While " dropping the kids off at the pool " is one some friends use to " drop a deuce ", not leave the kids to their aquatic playtime. I have been known to start singing " Boom boom boom boom ", tho. LOL <p> american swear <p> swearing in america is like anything else. just depends on the person. i myself love inserting swear words into the middle of other words i.e that is fan-fu#$ing-tastic. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or me if I 've worked third shift recently. We swear like sailor. <p> gin <p> " Restroom " is the public loo. I was informed that they 're called that because many of them used to have a " lounge " or waiting area with chairs and a mirror in one room that you passed through to enter the room with the toilets. A " bathroom " is what you have in your home that has a sink, shower and/or bathtub, and the toilet. <p> Skankardly <p> you 've never been to Boston then. Swearing is our first language. <p> Doug Bermingham <p> And " snog " and " wocher " are n't just as confusing? I STILL do n't have a consistent definition of either of those, FYI <p> Mike <p> what 's a snog or wocher???? <p> http : **32;1101;TOOLONG Jeckyl Draco <p> snog = making out usually wocher = what 's up <p> basically is how i understand it. <p> http : **30;1135;TOOLONG Elizabeth Carrico <p> Wocher is : how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what snog is. What is Wocher? <p> Erika L. Statler <p> " Snog " means make-out of kiss, I believe. <p> You totally have me on " wocher " -- maybe, it means, " Hey! What 's up?! " <p> http : **29;1167;TOOLONG Andrea Mc <p> Doug, ' snog ' is a full-on kiss and ' wocher ' is a greeting, probably short for " What you up to? " <p> Lisa <p> That. is. fantastic.( Says the American who is, by the way, a little Irish and a little English.) <p> http : **27;1198;TOOLONG Aaron Dorsey <p> When an American From the South says : " Bless it 's heart " Translation : That is the dumbest/ugliest thing I have ever heard/gazed upon Does n't mean : I hope that an ordained minister visits you and blesses just the circulatory organ of your child <p> Southern hospitality is a myth. I lived all over the south for a few years and all I saw were racists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my experience in the south was primarily bad. I 'll never understand why people constantly say people from the south are nice. People are people. Some are nice and some are n't. The fact that there are way more racists and bigots in the south seems to make the southern hospitality thing a huge joke. <p> http : **30;1227;TOOLONG Nina Dee <p> Bigots and racists are all over. I 'm from the South, member of one of the groups oft target by said bigots and racists, and I still woud n't be from anywhere else. Always a few bad apples, but we are mostly a hospitable bunch. <p> dorthy <p> Personally? As someone from Texas, I 'd rather go to the NorthWest. Part of that is because of the climate and scenery and part of that is that it 's hard to get to really know more of people than what they want to show you. I know that 's something that happens everywhere, but I 've just come across a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to really deal with people. <p> I do n't know if I really explained that well, but... I hope it makes sense. <p> Jamie <p> A myth? No, but there are always exceptions to everything. Southern Hospitality is just not as prevalent as they would like you to think, is all. <p> I 'm an American and agree with Jamie. I have encountered rudeness in the South more often than ersatz " hospitality. " <p> Transplant <p> Maybe you need to try the North to have a proper comparison for the South. Having lived in all of the above, I can say honestly that Southern Folks do have more manners, and are overall nicer than those in the North. Children in the South routinely use, " Ma'am " and " Sir " To the extent that it becomes ingrained and they also use those terms as adults. <p> http : **32;1259;TOOLONG John Cowan <p> Oh, for heaven 's sake. " Bless your/his/her heart " *can* be sarcastic, but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a perfectly positive meaning as well. <p> I am not sure why this person is on the BCC america site... this person HATES americans and while I am not saying that there is not a place to make fun of americans if you want to, but it it starting to really just piss me off that its on the BBC AMERICA site... have a nice day <p> Jackie O <p> This list is kind of silly. Having lived in London for about 5 of my adult years( I am American). I have never had to explain myself when saying " have a nice day " " Let 's do lunch " " I like your shirt " or " I COULD N'T care less ". " Happy Holidays " is pretty self explanatory too. Not all Americans are idiots and not all Brits are confused by us. <p> Laurie <p> I agree. I am American and love to visit England. I know people who would be baffled by British comments just because I know Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. British people have been very accommodating whenever I visit their country. <p> I could care less <p> You could n't have said it any better! People like that make American look inadequate... <p> http : **28;1293;TOOLONG Joe Ruivo <p> And just think what " we " in New England did to butcher the King 's English. " Wicked Pissah " <p> Jeanette318 <p> You got mine with number 8, Could care less? Well, try it and get back to me. <p> Pieda <p> I was talking to my cousin who 's American, and her friend was there, and she sounded like a sterotypical Valley girl... She said ' shut up ' like how it 's said in ' The Princess Diaries ', or how the character Regina from Mean Girls says it. <p> Kristen <p> When people in Britain kept asking me " you alright? " I thought I must look upset or sickly -- that one confused me a lot. Once I realized it was meant as more of a greeting or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too. <p> Rose <p> Same here! I still find it an awkward greeting to respond to. Are you supposed to say " yes, I 'm fine "? It totally feels like the person is actually asking if I am all right, as though something might be wrong. <p> http : **33;1323;TOOLONG Joe Luscombe <p> No you say ' alrite? ' back. It 's a way of acknowledging someone who you know. <p> Amanda <p> I would confuse some Brits rather bad. I have a bad habit of asking people if they 're alright when they 're quiet, probably because it starts verging on feeling like they 're ignoring me( even when they are n't intending to) and that feeling unnerves me. <p> http : **29;1358;TOOLONG Liz Musselman Kerr <p> Kristen and Rose, same with me! " Ya'reet? " confused me for a long time. I found myself running to the loo and checking my face in the mirror to see if I looked sick or upset in some way! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting, the way we American college youths say, " Hey ". <p> Britannia <p> It 's a bit like when I first came to California and people greeted me with " Hi. How are you "? Before I started to tell them how I was, they were off on their merry way. Now I realize " how are you? " is just a form of greeting. It does n't mean the person actually wants to hear how you are. And I 'm afraid that now I use the phrase that way myself. <p> dork <p> It 's exactly the same as the way an American would say " How are you? " while walking past at fifty miles an hour and not stop to hear your reply. i.e. just a greeting. <p> I 'm an American and I find it really funny. Also, number 8? So very true, and so very maddening. <p> Jamie <p> Some of these are a bit condescending, but I TOTALLY agree with number 8, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laurie <p> Brent, I agree! <p> Martin <p> Swag. Sick of it. <p> http : **30;1389;TOOLONG? id=5... John Wright <p> s.w.a.g. = American for " scientific wild assed guess ". <p> http : **35;1421;TOOLONG... Valorie Fisher <p> Also means " stuff we all get " for example goodie bags at the Oscars and birthday parties You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. " <p> Carrie <p> I ca n't get used to " Cheers "! I 've been to England a dozen times and whenever I go anywhere everyone 's saying " Cheers ". I feel like I should raise a glass in salute. Even when I 'm leaving a pub and the barman says it, I want to return to my seat and tap someone 's glass with mine. A note on the toilet thing... when someone says that, to me it means they have to go NOW. It 's an SOS type moment. Forget the formalities, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite. No one needs to know what I 'm doing in there( as I could just be fixing my hair). And I always say, " I 'm Irish! " Drunk or not. <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> YES! and me too. My ancestors( some of them just 2 generations ago) were from England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, and Switzerland <p> http : **28;1458;TOOLONG Nick Clift <p> Hey Ruth, how are these Americanisms ' meh ' and ' lame '. You dug about as deep as BBC America does in its programming. We 've started calling it the Top Gear channel, used to be awesome, now ' it sucks '. <p> Pat Chandler <p> Nick we call it the Gordon Ramsey channel. Wish they would have covered the Olympics though. <p> http : **32;1488;TOOLONG Jessica Thraen <p> they CA N'T legally cover the olympics in the US. NBC bought the rights for that for $1.2 billion. <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crotophaga <p> The " Top Gear/Filthy Mouth " channel. <p> Riki B <p> Could n't agree more about BBC America. Whoever does the program scheduling needs to be fired because the never ending repetitive stuff is extremely insulting to the viewers. Can you imagine the uproar if the BBC in the U.K. dished up Top Gear night after night. I rest my case. <p> It really depends on the American, and what part of the country they are from. I am from the Pacific Northwest, and we do nt talk the same way here as they do in the south. I find many phrases that are used in America silly, American English is a funny language, and most Americans do nt even speak it well. <p> http : **29;1556;TOOLONG Jadestone <p> Agreed. I lived in several states and am told by everyone that I have an accent. I 've picked up a little here and there. What bothers me most about this site is not some of the misconceptions.( Which is okay, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) it 's the people saying that they are Americans and hate America. Simple truth : If you do n't like where you are( in life, geographically, etc.) then make the change to go where you want to.( Move, get a better education for a better job, etc.) <p> Joseph DiCrisotofano <p> And when an American says, " the author of this article is out of touch with the underlying context of language, " what he means is that she ignorant. <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> good one! <p> http : **32;1587;TOOLONG Joanna Carmel <p> Uh-oh. They 're on to us! <p> skeptical <p> Oh Joseph. Did your feelings get hurted? <p> Sara <p> The first couple of them are just unnecessarily insulting to Americans. Basically, you 're saying they 're just liars. <p> http : **29;1621;TOOLONG Jadestone <p> Number 2 and 7 are so off. If someone wants to have lunch with you it means they actually enjoy your company and want to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt is cute that is a compliment of your style and should always be followed with a " Thank you, I got it at... " as that can sometimes be a way of further socialization. <p> http : **32;1652;TOOLONG John Cowan <p> #7, though very crudely put, is actually warning of an important confusion. When an American compliments someone, it 's meant sincerely, but does n't go further than what is said. If I say you play the tuba well, I really do mean that I like your tuba playing. However, I am not trying to flatter you, suck up to you, or get in your pants by saying so ; I 'm just trying to find a single point of connection between us. This is obvious to Americans but not to others, who tend to only use compliments in the three situations I mentioned. <p> http : **29;1686;TOOLONG Amanda Renfer <p> In some cases, like high school though, " What a cute shirt " often leads to an insult about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done out of pure spite( such as dumping juice on it). It can also be veiled as " oh what a cute shirt "( on you, I would n't be caught dead in it though). <p> Let 's have lunch sometime can simply mean " let 's hang out and chat " or " I 'm afraid to ask you on a date, so i 'll ask if you want lunch to see if you like me ". <p> You <p> It 's true though. Canadians say the same two phrases. So the hypersensitivity is a little dramatic. <p> http : **35;1717;TOOLONG... Michelle Kent <p> I work in an ' American Shop ' and when I tell people to ' have a nice day, ' I actually mean it. Life is too short to be negative all the time and I say what I mean, not the opposite. <p> http : **27;1754;TOOLONG Katey Newman <p> My day gets super boring if I do n't get to chit chat a little with customers every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work in two different locally owned stores, and we get some very regular customers that I could very easily be friends with outside of just talking to them while I work. <p> hi <p> My ex-boyfriend dumped me 6months ago after I accused him of seeing someone else and insulting him.I want him back in my life but he refuse to have any contact with me.I was so confuse and do n't know what to do, so I reach to the internet for help and I saw a testimony of how a spell caster help them to get their ex back so I contact the spell caster and explain my problem to him and he cast a spell for me and assure me of 2days that my ex will return to me and to my greatest surprise the third day my ex came knocking on my door and beg for forgiveness.I am so happy that my love is back again and not only that, we are about to get married.once again thank you aloma spell.you are truly talented and **39;1783;TOOLONG... is the only answer.he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing him because he is a wonderful man **30;1824;TOOLONG <p> Daven <p> Yes! Same here. I used to work at a retail store as a clerk in the Tanger outlets in NY. I know some employees just say it because they have to, or are only generally helpful/polite to customers because they have to be, but I never see a reason not to be polite and helpful, on my own. Why should n't a person actually mean it? It 's not like the customers are the cause of all personal woes... lol <p> http : **29;1856;TOOLONG Ethan <p> Oh you Brits... you 're so bloody adorable, with your pluralizing words that should be singular and vice-versa( e.g. sport and maths) and other stuff. We 're two countries separated by a common language. <p> Dave <p> We say maths because the word mathematics has an S at the end. By the way America, not all English people are from London and Britain is 4 separate countries, we all speak different languages and different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different version of English, but let 's not forget that we invented the language, to say were wrong is like someone from Mexico telling someone from Spain that they 're dialect is wrong. <p> Rachelle <p> I 'd like to point out that the dude was complementing ' Brits ' in a way, and that historically speaking we invented English too, sense although not everyone in America is English the country founded itself with English people, furthermore the correct terms for certain areas in the U.S are New England, Giving us leeway to adapt the language The South, The Midwest, The Mid-Atlantic <p> Actually the Germans and the Romans and the Vikings " invented " English.... because it is a sloppy whore of a language that takes all of the easiest pronunciations( damn the spellings) of words and turns them into one langauge.... so, if you 'd like to take credit for " creating " the bastard child of a language from 3 different countries who made you their bitch, as your own brilliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original lanuage probably originated in Turkey. However the standardisation of the English bible gave us the modern English language. <p> Calculate the proportions here.. population v. medals.. and then do your smug comparison. <p> Billyp <p> Okay, then why is the US on par with China? oooorrrrr... Grenada! Grenada! Grenada! Lost empire. Got ta sting. <p> Trevor Hope <p> this entire chain of replies in unneeded. <p> Paul <p> We also can see America is full of A$$holes. And I 'm American. <p> You <p> Because your use of expletives and appropriate syntax really shows how awesome you are. <p> Skankardly <p> nice. <p> Nancy <p> Never, in my 32 years of living in the US, have I EVER heard someone say, " Happy Independence Day! " Maybe a " Happy 4th. " Besides, anymore it 's about our current soldiers and their efforts. That and barbecues. <p> Sandlapper <p> And fireworks.... <p> http : **30;1887;TOOLONG? id=5... Anne Noble <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native Americans and marginalized you all. <p> taylorrr <p> lmao.. that 's a good one! i 'm american, even.. <p> Jo <p> Ahh yes, because we all know that throughout history England would never take over someone else 's land. <p> I 'm guessing maybe 30% of us Americans know the actual name for the holiday we celebrate on July 4.( was tempted to write 4.7). <p> Brittania <p> In England we call it Thanksgiving! <p> Lala <p> What retailers pay on commission these days? Did you just see Pretty Woman for the first time? <p> http : **30;1919;TOOLONG Elizabeth Carrico <p> Ah, Nordstrom for a start. <p> random <p> oh and Olympic Medal Count : Scoreboard!! <p> random <p> TEAM USA!! <p> Abbie <p> These are all absolutely true, I am an American and I really wish that I was British! <p> Skankardly <p> move. <p> http : **35;1951;TOOLONG Mike Netty Ornce <p> move! <p> IrishAmerican <p> american military term " head " does not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. it mean loo, restroom, bathroom <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> I believe that 's a Navy Term, No? <p> yankdyke <p> " head " is used to refer to a toilet on a boat by thosein the nautical world <p> Hannah <p> I 've been to england and i must say you have some very obscure words yourselves. <p> Michael <p> Check back soon... <p> Maureen M. Connor <p> I 'm not happy with the first one on this list. I am an American and I do mean when I say " Have a good day " We 're not all ass holes here. Thanks a whole bunch for putting all of us in one giant lump group. Also My family has Irish heritage that we can trace back so I am comfortable saying that " I am an Irish American " and " I 'm Irish " When some one asks what my heritage is. So how about an article about " What British assumptions on Americans bother you? " <p> Aaaargh <p> A bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author recently interacted with an American that irritated her. <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> or it was spurred by the general attitude that we 're all stupid idiots. <p> http : **30;1988;TOOLONG James Estes <p> When this American says, " zzzz. " Translation : " Good Lord, what a tedious list. " <p> Jeckyl <p> They are just making the translations people. You are over offended because you know its true lol. It may not be about commission as much as customer service, but most people in the WORLD do n't care so much for others they do n't know personally. It 's just a greeting. <p> Denise <p> Wow, That was a little mean spirited was n't it? Sometimes " Have a nice day " really means Have a nice day. Clearly from the tone of this article you are not having a nice day. I 'm sorry someone pissed on your parade. Perhaps as an expat in the US you should embrace the colloquialisms with some humor instead of assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in to the ground. <p> Jamie <p> I agree. Not all Americans are this mean-spirited... this makes it out that we are lying jerks who care about no one. If I do n't want a person to have a nice day, I say nothing, haha. <p> http : **30;2020;TOOLONG? id=5... John Wright <p> A lot of these have to do with overworked, frantic people trying to remain polite in the face of exhaustion. If your writers want some very funny examples of idiosyncratic speech, then they need to explore the expressions used in the Southern States. One of many of those are, " if a Southerner says " bless his heart ", he is actually saying, " what a blooming idiot ". <p> http : //twitter.com/TeriNall Teri Nall <p> OK this was funny, but if I tell someone to have a nice day I genuinely mean it. In fact, if I say any thing to you, I mean it. If I do n't( i.e. a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have anything nice to say, unless you 've pissed me off, I generally wo n't say ANYTHING to you, because you 're not worth the waste of oxygen. <p> lindsey <p> I do n't agree with some of these. There are nice Americans that actually try to be friendly with other people. Some of these are really silly... do all Brits take everything literally... you really do n't know what " good job " means? which could definitely mean you did well on something... maybe not your career, but on a school assignment or something like that. It 's equivalent to " job well done. " And " happy holidays "? I realize you call your vacations holidays but things like Christmas, New Year 's, Easter, Halloween, etc are called holidays. So saying Happy Holidays is akin to saying Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Restroom is really just the polite way of saying bathroom. Some people also say " Where is the ladies ' room? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something. And telling someone you like their shirt or shoes... could really just be someone saying they think another person 's clothes look nice... <p> http : **32;2052;TOOLONG Tara Lackey Johnson <p> Should you ever have the interesting experience to visit Texas, " Bless your heart " means they think you are an idiot and only Jesus can save you from your own stupidity. <p> http : **35;2086;TOOLONG... Valorie Fisher <p> Tara, you nailed it! <p> Mm <p> This is certainly not a culturally interesting piece. Educated people usually enjoy differences between their country and a foreign one. We are talking about differences in expressions not female circumcision after all!

I 'm an American too, and I thought this was funny. I could n't even relate to some of these sayings personally, because I do n't use some of them, but I know other people that do.

Sandy Conley <p> True about the commission -- as in, there is n't one. Not in an ordinary shop. We say " Have a nice day!

" because nobody knows your name anymore. And, sometimes, we do say it because we care about what sort of day you 're having, because we crave a couple seconds of actual human interaction and we think possibly you might too. <p> And as for greetings, my favorite is the old traditional one the Yats say in New Orleans -- " Where y'at? " Makes no sense at all logically since they can see you and know where you 're at, but it 's still awesome. <p> Erika L. Statler <p> I know the post was meant to be funny, but I 'm getting irritated by my foreign friends who assume that almost all Americans are rude. It 's posts like Ruth Margolis ' that perpetuate stereotypes and breed intolerance. <p> For #1, when I say, " Have a nice day! " I actually mean it. I like to conclude conversations with people I 've spoken with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #2, I would never invite a perfect stranger to lunch, but when I do invite someone to have a meal with me, I mean it and actually make plans for it. <p> #4, " Good job! " is a nice way of congratulating someone on doing something they had attempted before and not accomplished or is reluctant to accomplish. <p> #5, I have nothing for this one because on March 17th, there are far too many drunken douchebags who claim to be Irish that actually are n't. I, on the other hand, know my ancestry and do n't need to bandy it about on that holiday. So I 'll give her that one. <p> #6, " You do the math " is not always said sarcastically. I 've said it when trying to express how difficult a situation is. I certainly do n't say it in a mean way, I say it as though the situation seems rather desperate and I 'm feeling helpless. <p> #7, this goes along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as code for sex as the definition of this phrase. <p> #8, not all Americans have poor grammar! <p> #9, and " loo " is a better word for using the toilet? Pardon out modesty and use of polite wording for what goes on in the bathroom. <p> #10, " Happy Holidays! " is far more polite that wishing someone a " Happy Christmas! " -- especially when they do n't celebrate the Christian holiday. Do all Brits wish their Jewish friends a " Happy Christmas! " or wish their Muslim pals that sentiment? We 're a little more sensitive to cultures than Brits seem to be if " Happy Christmas! " is the phrase used across the pond in the month of December. <p> Just because Americans and Brits have different slang does n't mean that one is better than the other. <p> The assumption that all Americans are snarky( and almost every one of those have a snarky " definition ") is rude and unfounded.

It 's not very often that the toilet is separate from the rest of the... bathroom?... restroom? -Whatever you wan na call it. Bottom line : It 's a cleanliness issue. That 's also why there 's lids to toilets! One thing I do wonder about is the refrigerators. Why so small? Would n't that mean you have to go to the store more often because you ca n't keep as much in there? Is the answer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just wonderin ' <p> NinjaPenguin <p> Brits use the term " Merry Christmas " at Christmas time because it 's Christmas. It is said to people that celebrate Christmas, not to people that do n't. It will often be said by those that do n't celebrate Christmas to those that do. We also wish our Muslim friends happy Eid, they do n't say it to non-Musims because non-Muslims do n't celebrate Eid. How is that not sensitive to other cultures? Think of it as wishing somebody a happy birthday,. It is said to the person who 's birthday it is, not by them. <p> Cerigachu <p> So Americans say ' Happy Holidays ' in the mistaken belief that only Christians celebrate Christmas? For most people in the UK Christmas is an almost entirely secular festival, based around family, fun, food and great telly, which you 'll find celebrated not only by Christians and atheists, but by many other people from other religions who choose to do something to mark the day. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care less.

Nothing to decode. Let 's not get started on English phrases and idioms. " Pick up the bone ", really? Really?

During a very very long church service at a relative 's church, I was asked if I needed to use the " rest room. "( In my family we did not use that phrase). Thinking that a rest was exactly what I needed, I said yes, only to be dismayed at the sight of an ordinary bathroom with no beds to lie down in at all. I was scolded for " not really needing to go " and brought back in for the rest of the sermon. Ugh.

It 's just plain wrong. If you disagree, then think about it for a little while. Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pointed out. I say " you alright? " as a greeting &; I can see how that would be confusing for somebody not familiar with that usage. <p> Ariel McClellan <p> I have to agree with JACKIE O... This is pretty stupid...( I am an american.) I would think if I was in London right now and I said " Have a nice day.. " I would n't have to explain myself. And you are right Jackie because most Americans are smart. We are the strongest country in the world. We landed our men on the moon before anyone else.. So before you start criticising Americans, start thinking about yourselves first... <p> James <p> I hate the greeting " What 's up? " I used to check the ceiling... and it has become so meaningless. They actually expect you to always answer " not much ". <p> snarkypants <p> 1. I say " have a nice day " to customers. Not so that they tell my manager I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity will actually make their day better. <p> 8. I guarantee you, the intelligent Americans are just as annoyed by " I could care less " as you are. <p> This article made me cringe, as an American. Embarrassed for the( unfunny, snarky, and inaccurate) writer. <p> http : **32;3035;TOOLONG Lindzy Meclaf <p> I 'm American and number four is completely wrong <p> Evangeline <p> Haha, speaking from the point of view of an American, I can verify that that these are mostly true. Except number five. I guess it could be true sometimes, but I know people who are first generation Americans because their parents were born in Ireland. Usually if our great great grandfather is Irish, we 'll say, " I 'm part Irish. " Article was still good for a laugh though. xD and, please, fellow American commenters, CALM DOWN. It 's all in fun, and you have to admit these are true in general even if they do n't apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- It annoys me to no end when people say " I could care less " because that is precisely NOT what they are trying to communicate. But no one ever seems to think about it. Another one I 'm hearing a lot lately : For Christ 's sakes. Sakes? Plural? REALLY PEOPLE!( for the record I 'm an American) <p> http : //twitter.com/CaraSaysNo Queen C <p> This article is condescending, but on the flip side is also extremely funny. I do agree that the author missed " bless your heart, " though that one can be sweet and/or a jab at someone. Number 8 though is a massive problem, and so true. I 'm from New Jersey, and I absolutely hate it when people say that, because obviously they mean " could n't. " I also have to say, though most do n't confuse me( and even mean the same thing over here), I also enjoyed the very toungue-and-cheek ' Things Brits Say ' article as well. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get so uptight over an obviously humorous article or two. <p> Carlos <p> Wrong on several counts. <p> You can say, " I hooked up with a friend for some basketball " for example. Which means a friend and I got together and played a game of basketball. It does not have to be just for sex. <p> When a drunken American says I 'm Irish. It has not a thing to do with his ancestors. It is really an ethnic, stereotypical, slur-of-an-excuse that says its okay that I am drunk, because I 'm Irish. Any insensitive drunk person can say it, even if he is Black or Hispanic, the ethnic link to alcoholism is understood. <p> The word restroom probably came down from Victorian England 's prudishness when it was considered impolite in the US to mention bodily functions in public or mixed( male/female) company. Same Victorian roots regarding the dinner table a generation ago in the US when one was asked if he wanted white meat or dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say breast or leg at the dinner table ; not for the chicken, for the people. <p> Denny <p> I watched a Wimbledon shopkeepers face go totally baffled when my sister in law, inquiring about the price of an item, asked " how much does this run? " <p> http : **35;3069;TOOLONG Barbara Whitlock <p> I 'm a little bit offended personally! I 'm an ex-pat... and quite frankly, I find Americans much more sincere than Brits. And regardless of what the deliverer of " have a nice day " is thinking, it 's better than the usual surly " piss orf " body language of most shop assistants in Eng. nowadays. I do n't care what they might be thinking, at least they are being superficially polite! <p> And.... most Americans really do mean " let 's get together for lunch " and " hooked up..... : definitely does n't mean what you 've said here..... I 'm an ' older ' person, and I 've had people say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with let 's say a waiter or bartender( in order to get some special service.....)... and I think GB created political correctness, so let 's not get into the Happy Holiday bit! Most people again, that I know say " Merry Christmas " <p> Do n't be so bloody shallow! <p> http : **35;3106;TOOLONG Barbara Whitlock <p> I think number 8 needs some degree of thought.... I usually say could n't, but " could care less " means that the person could care even more less than they are expressing or caring at the time.... oh dear, how do I put this in to words? but I do think it could be a valid way to say it???? Put me right someone.... <p> vachicago@hotmail.com <p> I am an American who has lived in the UK for several years and traveled here for business for years before that. I must say this is exactly what I have come to expect from the BBC. Disguised as " a bit of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make American looks stupid so that Brits can feel inherently superior. Thankfully, most Brits I know can laugh at both the pluses and minuses of both the US and the UK, without the need to put someone else down to feel better about yourself. In the end BBC, somehow, like magic, the United States has produced a remarkable society of great achievement and one with has been a good friend to this country. All this despite being the lot of backwards morons we all appear to be in your consistently slanted coverage. When will you ever acknowledge the US may have done just a thing or two well? <p> offhandmanor <p> And some of us mean it 's not a place to LIE down and have a rest!( photo caption) LIE LIE LIE not LAY down unless it 's your burdens. Glad I laid that one on yez. <p> http : **30;3143;TOOLONG? id=1... Barbara Berman <p> right on the nose, you 've been here a while. <p> WF <p> Your explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me! <p> Katie <p> People need to stop taking this so seriously! I think the point of this article is simply to illustrate that there are phrases Americans use frequently that may be foreign to a Brit. Sure, they can probably figure out what we mean, but it could throw them off momentarily. Have n't any of you heard a new phrase and thought it meant something it did n't? <p> One of the more nebulous Britishisms I 've encountered is the various forms of the word " sorted. " " Well-sorted " seems to connote excellence, while " sorted " can mean " finished, " as in " Well, we 've got the ticket situation all sorted. " I enjoy the differences the pond has created. <p> namelessanon <p> The only one that is annoying is the ' I could care less ' one ; which, let 's be honest, is totally incorrect, gramatically speaking. Asides from that, they 're not really that hard to work out. Even ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's just irritating as heck. <p> Shivangi Narayan <p> Now that colonising people is no longer in vogue, is this how you spend your time? Claiming superiority over a language that has grown extensively and has transcended the domains of the " right " and the " wrong " Accept it, o great UK, more and more people speak a variant of English that is far removed from the Queen 's English today. The language has moved on, high time you do too. <p> SUppA <p> I am neither British nor American. But I can definitely say that regardles of what americans say, they have great herats wile british were always arrogant and hating <p> Chris T <p> Guys, this article is obviously idiotic. The BBC is just trolling us for page views and ad revenue. I say we stop commenting and let Ms. Ruth Margolis get back to her bitter and obviously unsatisfying life as a hack journalist. <p> Dave Van Dam <p> Sorry you have been placed in a such a horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't let the door hit you on the way out! " <p> http : **27;3175;TOOLONG Kevin Matthew Hall <p> Someone actually got paid to write this mean-spirited, pointless piece? It 's a shame that trying to be civil and polite is viewed by this writer as being " irritating " and " annoying ". The Bristish have a beautiful word to describe this article : " Rubbish! " <p> Uncle Samuel <p> An American reads this article, and thinks, " What a cunt. " <p> Translation : " The author is clearly a poor excuse for a woman, one for whom only the most foul and crudely misogynist descriptor is appropriate. " <p> Definitely does not mean : " I am chiding the author in an offhand, friendly/sarcastic manner. " <p> http : //btwnworlds.tumblr.com/ Lou G <p> Me doth think England is still bitter... <p> What this means : England is still P.O. they lost a war to a bunch of upstarts and to sign a treaty recognizing they had done so 229 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes a little sour. <p> Joe American <p> Can you figure out what an American means when he or she says " Suck it, you pretentious British twat "? <p> Johnatan <p> The article depicts the observation of a spiritless person unable to get the touch. <p> elder <p> When in the UK I found that many people who work with the public have developed a " very polite " way of being nasty. They also wo n't volunteer any info like most Yanks do if asked a question. So things are not all rosy there. Yes, as some Yanks are rude... but more often I find my day passing more pleasantly because of cheerful employees in the retail stores. Must be the big cities where the writer lives.... too sad. <p> Amy <p> This was amusing. I 'm American. I say " I could n't care less " believe it or not. And when I say " Have a nice day! " I mean it. <p> Rich Bessey <p> When I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " Only if you insist " <p> William Carlin <p> I have to agree with this, having lived in America my entire life, the only other country I 've been to was Korea. I did n't even have to speak the language to understand that they were on a much more sincere level of respect between each other. Unlike here where it 's more like, " Hey, if you do n't do anything for me I do n't want you near me f*ck off " <p> William Carlin <p> Also, I 'm not one to get upset over other countries criticism of america. I know very few places you can go to and actually meet a majority of Sincerely Kind, Heart Warming people. I 've lived in lot of different places and I think I only found one. It was right outside of a military post. On the plus side, I 'm not offended by next to anything except for people who insult my cooking. That 's the only time I get upset LOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't as open to being lightly mocked as we are. Number 8 had me in stitches. <p> Jenn <p> Huh. Sounds like someone put on their grumpy pants the morning this was written. <p> Actually, I prefer the " have a nice day " to the local shop girls who do n't stop their gossipy conversation while I wait for someone to help me with a purchase. <p> Also, " let 's have lunch " or " let 's have coffee " often means just that, at least with my friends. Huh. Could be the problem. <p> And I do n't see where my " good job " back in the US is any different than my " well done " here in the UK, but whatever. <p> And yes, I " get " sarcasm( surprisingly, it IS N'T limited to the British) but this verges on bitter, bless your heart. <p> Missy Carmean Burr <p> Whoever wrote this is an idiot and an embarrassment to both Ireland and anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> dude. <p> LOL @ americans making commission. maybe if you work at a cell phone store. or a car dealership. have a nice day is just way to be polite and nicely see someone off rather than to just say goodbye. <p> Hello every one, i just want to share a few testimony about how my marriage got saved by agbalaxy@gmail.com. I had a fight with my husband and he got mad at me and decided to bring in another woman, i know i did wrong and was scared of loosing him, when he brought in another woman to the house, i thought i have lost him already and that was when i had to use agbalaxy@gmail.com spell and i was amazed the way the spell turned the table around and made my husband start chasing me and want to be with me again. am so happy now that my husband is back to me and me alone........ Kim <p> KidVersion <p> Hey! I say " have a nice day " because they were nice, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sarcastic tone... And I rarely say " good job " so if I do, that means you REALLY did a good job.... And I live here, so if someone has a problem with it, go somewhere else. <p> Don Rohn <p> Have you lived in America? I just ran across this and was born here. It looks like you have no idea what you 're saying. #3, 8, 9 and 10 make sense, but the rest seem like you 're being a cynical dick..( cock chops probably makes more sense to you..) <p> Samantha Ventura <p> how are you gon na say what we mean? i live in New York City and I 'm pretty sure you do n't read minds and know what everybody is thinking <p> Samantha Ventura <p> this is so pathetic <p> Samantha Ventura <p> did n't know you could go inside my mind and know what i actually mean, I 'm a New Yorker i live in
