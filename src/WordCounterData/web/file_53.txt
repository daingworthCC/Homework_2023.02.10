5031841 <p> Hester, the long-time Chicago Bears return man, is the stuff of nightmares for NFL kickers and punter. <p> " He 's fearless, he 's willing to take risks with the ball, and he knows exactly what to do to get the ball up the field, " Harris said. " He 's the best ever. " <p> It 's tough to argue that assessment. Hester is the NFL 's all-time leader in touchdown returns, bringing back 12 punts and five kickoffs for scores in his first six seasons. He 's done it twice against the Lions, once with a kickoff in 2007 and on a punt last season. <p> Kassim Osgood, a gunner on punt coverage, will be one of the first men down the field trying to drop Hester before he can find a crease.

Considering his career net average is 35.7 yards, that 's a potential 10-yard swing in field position with each punt. <p> If the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players do n't view it as conceding or a sign of weakness. <p> " No, not at all, " Osgood said. " It 's all a matter of strategy. Most people want to limit his touches. " <p> Harris agrees. <p> " He has a higher percentage chance than anyone else to take it back for a touchdown.
