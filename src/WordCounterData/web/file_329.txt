5059641 <p> Summary : written for wankingstyles, and Liel, I apologise profusely for the ridiculous amount of time it 's taken me to write this. The prompt being : Louis is afraid of what people think when he and Harry interact in public, because he 's afraid of coming out. Harry understands, of course he does, until fear gets the better of Louis, and they stop interacting altogether. <p> A/N : This sucks. This sucks. It 's 10,000 words of suckiness. But thoughts would be brilliant. <p> The morning light filtered in through the Venetian blinds : the sun 's gaze blared inside, and bathed everything within its vicinity in a gentle, canary hued light. It was an uncharacteristically warm February morning ; the firmament was a glaze of lapis, veined with white, as it smiled down upon the city of London. <p> Louis sat up in bed, slumped against the headboard, with the covers pooled around his pelvis, as a fond smile etched itself across his chapped lips. His eyes blazed with the inexplicable flame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this, Hazza? " <p> Harry stopped dead in the doorway : he was already dressed, having donned a pair of black jeans and a blue t-shirt that just did n't quite conceal the damage Louis ' teeth had done to his collarbones. In his hands, he carried a white tray, which, even from a distance, Louis could tell had a stack of pancakes and a mug atop it. <p> " Er, " the younger boy began, as a grin threatened to split across his face. Striding across the wooden floors with an almost feral grace that only he could seem to embody, Harry easily placed the tray of breakfast on the side table, and plunged in to press a lazy kiss upon Louis ' lips, " Morning, love. " <p> " Morning to you, too, " Louis answered, carding a hand through his boyfriend 's curls -- who, in turn, melted into the touch -- and straightened up to steal another kiss, " But really, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? You 're gorgeous, babe, but you look much better with them off. " <p> A soft blush spread over Harry 's face : his cheeks were tinged pink as he emanated a low chuckle, " This, Tomlinson, " he captured Louis ' lips within his : their mouths connecting for a brief moment as he hummed in contentment, " is your breakfast, because last night was fucking amazing. " <p> Louis worried his bottom lip between his teeth ; his eyes were glazed over and he unconsciously rubbed the nape of Harry 's neck. Turning, he cast his attention onto the tray the younger boy had brought, and quickly speared a bit of pancake onto his fork, and popped the bite into his mouth, " Was it? Was it better than -- God, Hazza, these are delicious. " <p> Harry leaned downwards and licked a bit of syrup off of Louis ' lips, toying with the bedcovers simultaneously. His hands ghosted over the gold-tinged flesh that stretched tight over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rippled under the encasement of smooth, unblemished skin. <p> Pressing an open mouthed kiss to Louis ' jaw, he commented, " Mmh, not as much as you are, and, yes, it was better than anything we 've ever done. " <p> " You 're just saying that because - " <p> " I love you? " <p> " Well, I was going to say it 's because you liked botto - " <p> " Because I 'm your boyfriend and it 's my job? " <p> " Fine, we 'll go with that, " Louis rolled his eyes, but could n't help but mirror Harry 's smile, " But why are you not naked and why am I not eating these pancakes off of you? " <p> Harry cocked an eyebrow, and swatted Louis on the arm -- unconsciously massaging the spot he had hit afterwards, like he did n't even know he was doing it. Bending, he pecked at the Doncaster boy 's lips a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Li 's for a bit, and you ruined my favourite sheets the last time you decided to eat breakfast off of me. " <p> " You 're just going to flit off in the morning, Styles? " <p> " I 'll stay right here if you ask me to, babe. " <p> " No, go, abandon me, " Louis answered ; petulance highlighting his voice, even as he allowed a smile to skim across his lips, " But only - " he deftly folded up the sleeves of Harry 's t-shirt so his biceps came into focus, " -- because I love you. " <p> " Love you, too, Lou, " Harry kissed him on his forehead, and passed him a fleeting glance, before exiting the room. <p> A lonely morning, Louis thought, not quite sure what to do with himself, because they had n't had a day off in a while. Well, it would n't be terrible, even if he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigh. The things he did for love. <p> Clambering to his feet and donning a pair of boxers, the Doncaster native loped across the bedroom, procured his laptop, and slithered back into the comfort of his bed. He turned the device on, smothering the sigh that was begging to escape his lips as his desktop loaded and his wallpaper came into focus( a picture of a wet Harry with a sleepy Louis clinging to him like the future of the world depended on it, which, let 's be honest, it did) and quickly logged onto his Twitter. <p> His mentions were never that interesting. Mostly, they were always a plethora of messages asking him for follow-backs, or asking him how She was( Harry had forbidden the use of her name under his roof, promising that he would withhold all sexual favours, including provision of food, because, seriously, if you 've tasted Harry 's cooking, then you know that it 's enough to have you on your knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple. <p> Really, Louis was sadistic enough to contemplate showing those messages to Harry, because jealous sex was the best sex there was. And with Harry, it was almost the only type of sex there was. <p> Anyway. <p> Then there were the Larry Stylinson fans, who devoted their lives and free time to Harry and Louis. And who would probably have a field day if they were to ever find out about what they did between the sheets. And on dining tables. And in public bathrooms. And there 'd been that one time when they 'd tried doing it on the tour bus, but Zayn had begged them to stop. <p> Well, Harry had pulled the curtain of the bunk shut, and had muffled Louis ' groans with his lips, but they had stopped in essence. <p> So, yeah, the fans would be in shock. <p> Scrolling down his mentions, Louis let out a yawn before halting at one that happened to be sent about half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : because @LouisTomlinson and @HarryStyles are totally dating. #stylinsonforever, with a link that followed. Shrugging, he clicked it, because, seriously, he 'd gone through fanfiction, expertly Photoshopped pictures, and even dimly lit videos, so, how bad could it get? <p> The url led him to a blog, and Louis ' brow furrowed as he read through the post. It was detailed -- it was detailed beyond imagination -- and, for a split second, Louis thought he was going to pass out. It was a lengthy analysis of every single moment he and Harry had shared over the past year. Every touch, every smile, every goddamn flinch -- all of it. And it was fucking chronicled in a post that had over twenty thousand notes. <p> Something akin to panic settled deep in the pit of Louis ' stomach as continued to scroll through : there was an animated GIF of him running his thumb over Harry 's ; of him stealing a glance at the younger boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm close to his boyfriend 's as they strived to get through another question about Louis ' relationship with her. <p> It was all there in black and white, and something that was definitely panic bubbled within him, and threatened to sear his insides. If this one person could so wholeheartedly believe in this, and if twenty thousand other people could see what was so obviously there, then how was it even possible for people to believe his faux-relationship with Eleanor was real? <p> When you contrasted the pictures of him and Harry, and their conspicuous connection, to the nonexistent connection -- well, it was based on many planned coffee runs and shopping trips -- he had with Eleanor, you could tell which one was real. <p> It was n't a joke anymore ; it was n't child 's play, or foolery. <p> It was n't a bromance anymore. <p> People could tell. <p> People knew, even if they did n't have confirmation. <p> No, they had confirmation. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked close enough, and, evidently, they had. <p> All because he and Harry had been idiots enough to think they could get away with it. <p> When Harry came home, he did n't notice how Louis was quieter than usual, or how he had n't bothered getting out of bed. He did n't notice how Louis stiffened when he leaned in for a kiss, or how he seemed almost reluctant to go to dinner together. <p> No, Harry did n't ask why Louis a metre ahead of him when they stepped outside, or why he dragged Niall along. Harry did n't ask why there were no intimate glances shared, or why he did n't reciprocate when Harry had placed a supportive hand on his knee under the table. He did n't even ask why Louis had merely shrugged when he 'd fixated him with a worried gaze. <p> No, Harry figured there was a reason for it all. <p> And Louis was grateful. <p> xxxxx <p> " Lou, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody flight! " <p> Harry paced around their sitting room : his visage was a mask of irritation, as impatience dominated his demeanour. They were late. Again. It did n't matter that they 'd set the alarm for five hours earlier, or the fact that Liam had left countless( well, the mobile did all the counting and rounded them as 35) missed calls, because they were still late. <p> It did n't even make sense, because Louis was delaying things on purpose, and it was driving Harry crazy -- absolutely mental. He did n't like yelling, but he was very close to doing it. <p> " Seriously, Curly, shut up, " Louis interjected ; smiling slightly as he descended the staircase. He was dressed almost... well, normally : having donned a pair of blue jeans, a navy sweater. " You should have gone already. " <p> " Was waiting for you, idiot, " Harry retorted, his lips contorted into a scowl as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haz, I 'm going with El, remember? " <p> No. <p> Harry halted midway in his attempt to drag his boyfriend 's luggage ; his eyes blowing wide open as the flickered with the undeniable viridian blaze of rage. When he spoke, venom underlined his words, and his voice was a hoarse ululation -- as if he could n't believe what he had heard, " I thought you were trying to rile me up when you said that. " <p> A strained chuckle escaped Louis ' lips, as he strode across the room and snaked his arms around Harry 's slender waist ; his hands stationed at the small of the younger 's back, trying to calm him, " I 'm glad you take me so seriously, babe. " <p> Scrunching his nose, and standing on his toes, the Doncaster boy tried to coax a kiss out of Harry, but the latter merely wrenched from his grip and fixated him with a glare that almost begged him to knock it off. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it was Eleanor : Eleanor in all her **40;4802;TOOLONG... glory, and her unnecessary need to cling to Louis as if she 'd die if she did n't. <p> Well, to be honest, if she did n't cling to Louis for backup, Harry would probably have skinned her alive for standing that close to his boyfriend, but that was n't the point. <p> The point was simple. <p> " Lou, you know I do n't like her, and you know I do n't want her there today, " Harry carefully enunciated ; every word stroked as the crack of whip as he warily glanced at the elder, " You know that, and you still - " <p> The Cheshire native furrowed his brow and took a seat on one of the sofas : his face buried in his hands as he willed his anger to keep at bay. Raking his hands through his hair, and tugging his silken tendrils out of frustration, he quickly drew himself up and conceded, " Fine, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his nature -- to succumb : to wave the white flag when Louis constituted of the opposition. It was ingrained within him, it was his lifeline. He could pretend to be in control, he could act dominative, and he could try his level hardest to overrule Louis. But it was all folly, because, at some point, he would succumb, and he would gladly do whatever it was that Louis asked of him. That was all that mattered, in the end. Louis was all that mattered. <p> Swinging his bag over his shoulder, Harry continued, " Do I get a kiss before I go off alone, and you go pick up your girlfriend? " <p> Louis pouted, jutting his bottom lip out, and scrutinising Harry all the while. His eyes were blue -- so fucking blue -- and Harry could n't help but smile as the older boy bit out a tiny, " ' Course, Hazza. " <p> Dropping his satchel, the younger boy crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent down to capture Louis ' lips in a fervent kiss : their lips melded against each other, as he secure his arms around Louis ' neck ; his fingertips dancing against the sheathed surface of the elder 's shoulder blades. <p> Harry was seething. Liam had noticed it in an instant, but he 'd opted to pretend otherwise until Niall had come up and blurted out a carefree, " What 's got your curls in a bunch, Haz? " <p> His curls were not in a bunch, thank you very much. <p> But his blood was boiling ; his tolerance had been sloughed away, and his pupils had been reduced to pinpricks. It was one thing to have her there, but it was an entirely different sort of cataclysmic event to have her there, and to have her kissing you. <p> Louis was going to die. <p> And I 'm going to kill him myself, Harry silently concluded, as his gaze roved over to where Louis was nuzzling Eleanor 's nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet. <p> No wonder the world thinks they 're in bloody love. <p> " Do n't frown, you 'll get wrinkles, " Zayn mused, wrenching the younger boy out of his reverie, as he held up an adorable Lux Atkin in his arms, " Your boyfriend wo n't love you when you look like an old woman. " <p> " My boyfriend wo n't have a boyfriend if he keeps this up, " Harry shot back, wiggling his eyebrows at the infant, and gesturing nonchalantly over to where Louis was planting fucking kisses onto her cheek, " And then he 's got the audacity to put those lips on me, too. " <p> Zayn threw Lux into the air, and revelled in her laughter as he secured her in his arms once more. Glancing at Harry sympathetically, he commented, " He does love you, you know that. " <p> " I know that, and you know that, but I wonder if he does. " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " Harry began, only to be cut off. <p> " I know, " Zayn agreed, looking past the Cheshire lad and taking in the image of Louis and Eleanor holding hands as they checked in, " but just have a little faith in him. " <p> A smile played across Harry 's lip, " I already do. " <p> " And, just think, you can spend the entire flight to New York cuddling, and making him pay for the show he 's got going on right now. " <p> " Really? " <p> " ' Course, mate. " <p> For his own sake, Harry prayed Zayn was right. <p> xxxxx <p> Zayn had not been right. <p> And Harry was torn between being heartbroken and just being plain furious. <p> Much to his chagrin, Louis had bounded onto the plane and had loudly declared that he wanted to sit next to Liam. This, incidentally, had pissed Zayn off, too. The older boy had completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Harry had deigned to ask him why he was n't sitting next to him, Louis had shrugged and insisted that he just wanted to talk to Liam. <p> Louis, Harry had learnt over the past two years, was an acquired taste. He could be sulk and he could hole himself up for ninety-nine days, but, on the hundredth day, he 'd be Louis again. He was insecure, despite the wall he had erected around himself, and it had taken Harry mere minutes to break through that external barrier to release the guarded persona within. But Louis was something else : Louis was something so entirely different, and so entirely perfect, that Harry could forgive him almost anything. <p> Somewhere along the line -- somewhere between the smiles, and the kisses, and the sheer need to just be with each other -- Harry had anchored himself in Louis ; as if he was his lifeline ; his salvation. <p> That 's why it always hurt a little bit more than it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too deep. Because every time Louis distanced himself, or kissed Eleanor, or held her hand, Harry could feel the foundations upon which he was staying afloat slipping for a mere second, as if to remind him that what he and Louis had was tangible. <p> And anything tangible could be broken. <p> Sighing and muttering a quick excuse to Zayn, Harry clambered to his feet and vaulted across the aisle, stopping where Louis and Liam were already asleep. The oldest member of the band had his head pillowed against the wall of the cabin, while Liam had his settled on Louis ' shoulder. Crouching, and glancing around to ensure that nobody saw him, Harry pressed a series of quick kisses onto Louis ' lips and roused him from slumber. <p> " Lou, " he whispered, shaking Louis gently, as a fond smile found its way to his lips. " Babe, wake up. " <p> It took a few more kisses, and Harry savoured the sheer warmth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something so utterly Louis, but the Doncaster boy eventually stared at him through bleary eyes and a veil of confusion. <p> " I love you, Lou, " Harry bit out : his visage was impassive, devoid of emotion, but there was a slight stutter in his voice ; a slight hitch, that gave way to the fact that he was up a creek without a paddle, and he needed Louis to save him. <p> " I love you, too, Hazza, " came the reply, and it was enough to quench the doubt that had started to bubble within him. <p> Plunging back in, Harry tried to recapture Louis ' mouth in a kiss, but Louis raised a finger to obstruct his path. Unperturbed, Harry 's lips danced over the pad of the older boy 's digit, as he pecked at the soft flesh. <p> " Harry, not here, " Louis chastised sternly, pulling away. <p> The younger boy blinked a few times ; his eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. Nodding, he drew back up, taut as a bowstring, and padded back to his own seat. <p> For the first time, in a long time, Harry felt like his lifeline might just be his death. <p> xxxxxx <p> Taking another generous gulp of orange juice, Louis sank back into his chair ; his cerulean eyes glimmering as the morning light fell upon them. They were at a radio interview this morning, and it was going better than he 'd hoped. <p> Except that Harry was sulking, and, as adorable as it was, it was slightly disconcerting. <p> The younger boy had barely spoken to him ever since they 'd deplaned in New York a day ago, and he had n't taken it particularly well when Louis had suggested they all have individual rooms. Management had loved the idea, realising it was a prime opportunity to crush the rumours that circulated Larry Stylinson, but Harry had taken it as a slight. He 'd shot Louis a singularly poisonous glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Louis had n't seen him again until this morning. <p> And now they were at a round table, and Harry was seated right next to him. Louis wanted to reach out and run a hand through the younger boy 's lush curls ; to fling an arm around his lithe shoulders, to glance at him and smile as if the rest of the world had blurred into obscurity, and only the two of them existed. <p> But he could n't. <p> He wanted to kiss the younger boy and not care about what anyone else thought. He wanted to hold Harry 's hand, and he wanted to admit that he was completely in love with him. <p> But he just could n't. <p> The only thing his little stunt with Eleanor at Heathrow airport had accomplished was that the Larry Stylinson shippers had noticed the cracks in the facade. They 'd easily pointed out how unbelievably uncomfortable he 'd looked while pulling in for a kiss( there was n't even a fucking height different, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he had n't even bothered putting his guitar case down while hugging the supposed love of his life. <p> Louis had panicked all over again at that. <p> And Harry was paying the price. <p> " So, Liam, Louis, " the interviewer interrupted Louis ' mental soliloquy, and continued in her absurdly cheery voice, " You both have girlfriends, am I right? " <p> Ah, here we go again. <p> " Yeah, we do, " Liam answered for both of them ; and Louis could n't help but envy how easy it was for him -- how natural it was. <p> The interviewer, however, had her eyes trained upon Louis : a calculating look smothered across her tanned visage as she pressed on, " It must be very hard to be away from them for so long a time, yes? " <p> There was a pause for a split second, and Louis felt Harry tense ; he felt the younger boy bristle at the question as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else, knowing that he was so in tune to the slightest of changes in Harry 's demeanour : how his breath had hitched, even if Louis did n't hear it doing so ; how his pupils had constricted and his viridian irises had transcended to a shade darker and laced with fear, even if Louis could n't see them ; how Harry was on the edge of a metaphorical precipice, ready to fall if he thought he was losing his boyfriend, even if he would never be able to tell Louis so. <p> " Yes, of course, " Louis began cautiously, knowing full well that Harry 's searing gaze was directed towards him, " But we get to fly them out, so it 's not all that terrible. " <p> " So Danielle and Eleanor will be visiting you on this leg of the tour? " <p> " Definitely. " <p> The interviewer prattled on about the consequences of having a relationship in regards to crazy fangirls, but Louis had zoned out by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perched on his leg : Harry 's palm was stretched over the expanse of his thigh ; the digits curled over the curve of his knee, as fingertips dug desperately into the soft fabric of his jeans. <p> It was the antithesis of what would usually happen. <p> Usually, it would be Louis who 'd stealthily squeeze Harry 's knee under the refuge of a table ; it would be Louis who would lend his silent support ; who would, in one minuscule gesture, let Harry know that everything was going to be okay. <p> But now it was Harry, and Louis did n't know what to do. Was the younger boy trying to reap support which he knew he was n't going to get? Louis ' eyes flitted over to where a video camera was poised onto them, recording every second of the interview, and forcing even the briefest moments of broken restraint on tape. There was a camera behind them as well. <p> Forgive me, Hazza. <p> Louis ran his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Gently tugging, he released the younger boy 's grip on his limb, and pushed the hand back -- a warning underling his actions ; a warning asking Harry to stop. <p> The reaction was instant. One moment, Harry was revelling under a sense of self-induced calm ; slouched and relaxed. The next, however, gave way to that side of Harry that frightened Louis : that unspoken dimension of his personality that nobody would ever discuss, but it was there, and it was painfully real. Harry had gone rigid ; his lips were mashed into a thin line as he stopped moving altogether. His breathing was laboured ; wracking his body as he inhaled. <p> But it was his eyes -- it was always his eyes -- that gave him away ; that spoke for him ; that screamed when he never would. The jade irises blazed with silent fury : a fire was alight within them that was wrought of pain, and fear, and need, and yet satiety was alien to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so open about those eyes, and, as Louis glanced at Harry, he realised why. <p> Harry would never be able to verbally reprimand him for anything he did ; he 'd never ask him why he was trying to distance himself, or why there was a newfound divide between them. <p> Louis knew that he needed to tell Harry why -- for both their sakes. <p> And he needed to tell him soon. <p> xxxxx <p> Night followed day, as death follows life, and the atmosphere was suffocating as the tension mounted beneath. Clouds gathered above ; forming a canopy of grey against the sable canvas of the firmament -- threatening to unleash a storm, and, yet, the true storm already raged below. <p> Harry shifted around in his bed : the covers haphazardly tangled around his lithe body, as he stared up at the ceiling ; insomnia coursing through his veins. His mussed curls were splayed over a crme-coloured pillow ; the emerald flame that once ravaged his eyes was nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But more than that, he was lonely. <p> Up until that night, he 'd handed Louis the benefit of the doubt on a silver platter. He 'd put up with how the elder had begun to distance himself when they were in public ; he 'd tried understanding why the elder had stopped maintaining eye-contact when they were outside ; he 'd even stopped coercing stealthy touches from his fucking boyfriend when they were in the midst of company. <p> He could n't take it anymore. <p> Tonight had been, for lack of a better word that encapsulated the situation, a fucking disaster. They 'd been performing in Chicago, that being the last concert of their American tour, and yet Louis had done everything within his power to just stay away from him. He 'd just stayed away, just like that, and Harry could n't imagine why. <p> People would notice, of course they would. People would talk about how strained their friendship was of late -- they 'd already started -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocated his smiles anymore. <p> And that hurt. <p> It was hard enough having to hide their relationship because Louis was n't ready to come out, but that was the equivalent of a knife being shoved down his throat, except more painful. Harry had never, ever, asked Louis for anything. He 'd never asked Louis to come out to the world as his boyfriend. He 'd never objected to Louis spending time with Eleanor and constantly getting photographed with the woman. He 'd never asked for anything -- anything -- that he thought would trouble Louis. <p> All he 'd asked for was to be loved. <p> That was all, and, yet, Louis could n't even do that. <p> Realising that there was almost no way in hell that he was getting sleep -- not that he 'd been getting any lately -- Harry got out of bed and strode through the door, uncaring that he was dressed in only his boxers. It was the middle of the fucking night, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their own fault if they encountered an eighteen year old popstar in his underwear. <p> Exiting his suite, the Cheshire lad vaulted across the dimly lit hallway. He needed to talk to Louis. For once in his life, he needed assurance -- he needed his boyfriend to fucking be his boyfriend, instead of shutting him out. Coming up in front of Louis ' suite, Harry rang the doorbell a few times in succession, before freezing on the spot. <p> I am not about to do this. <p> Oh, God. <p> No. <p> Maybe there was still time to -- <p> The door swung open to reveal a dishevelled Louis : the older boy was rubbing his eyes as he glanced warily at the visitor, " Haz, what are you doing? " <p> It 's now or never, mate. <p> " I need to talk to you, " Harry answered back ; his voice hoarse and lined with defeat, as he followed his boyfriend into the hotel room. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response ; an understanding smile playing across his lips, even as he stumbled slightly closer. Smoothing the back of his hand over Harry 's cheek, he murmured, " I know. " <p> " Lou, we - " <p> " Can we do this in the bedroom? I ca n't stand right now. " <p> Harry 's gaze raked over bloodshot eyes, and sallow skin that had once been tanned to perfection. The Doncaster boy had donned a frayed orange sweater that actually belonged to Harry, and a pair of black sweatpants. But even the baggy attire could n't mask what Harry had noticed a long while ago : Louis was losing weight, just as he was, himself. <p> Instinctively wrapping an arm around Louis ' slender waist, Harry buried his face into the elder 's feathery locks, and pressed a series of kisses to his forehead, " ' Course, love. " <p> Louis nodded in thanks, and trudged over the carpeted floor and into bedroom : flopping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry noted how it did n't look like he 'd been asleep : the sheets stretched tight over the bed, as if they had n't been moved, except for one rumpled spot where Louis, had, no doubt been seated. Harry could imagine Louis sitting with his legs pulled up and his laptop perched precariously upon his knees -- he could imagine the way the older boy would have worried his bottom lip between his teeth, while pulling the sleeves of the sweater down so they covered his hands. <p> Lying down onto the bed, Harry cupped Louis ' jaw, and stroked his thumb over the soft skin that stretched taut over his cheekbones, " Lou? " <p> " Mmh? " The Doncaster boy 's reply was muffled ; but his eyes bore with clarity ; the clear cut blue twinkling with flecks of grey within ; shining as if they knew what was coming. <p> " Lou, " Harry started ; shifting so his body was lined against Louis ' : eyes to eyes, lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entwined, " Why are you doing this? " <p> " Doing what, Hazza? " Louis whispered ; his words breathed against Harry 's lips ; the warmth of his exhalation sending a shiver down the younger boy 's spine. <p> " You know what. " <p> " You 'll have to enlighten me, babe. " <p> A flash of something akin to rage dawned across Harry 's visage ; and his voice was leaden, as he shot back, " Fine, Louis. Why are you treating your fucking boyfriend like some sort of dirty little secret that you 'd rather just ended up leaving you alone? " <p> " Harry, I - " Louis began, only to be cut off. <p> " Or, here 's a better one, why are you completely ignoring your boyfriend, and pretending as if he just does n't exist? " <p> " I never - " <p> " But here 's my favourite, why have n't you properly kissed your boyfriend in over a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't sleep alone? " <p> " Harry. " <p> " You 've bloody ignored me this entire time, and I just want to know why. " <p> His voice had quavered, he knew that. He knew he probably looked, for all he was worth, a wreck, and an idiot, but he needed to know that he was n't putting his everything into something that would destroy him in the end. <p> But Louis looked exactly the same, if not worse, and Harry was n't sure whether he should feel outraged or guilty. <p> Levering himself up on one elbow, Louis conceded, " Fine, I 'll show you why, just let me grab my - " <p> " No, " Harry interjected, sitting up, and securing his hands around Louis ' waist to keep him in place, " You 're going to tell me why, Lou, I do n't want to see anything -- I just need you to tell me why. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older boy stammered, before rising to press his lips to the shell of Harry 's ear, " it 's because of the fans. " <p> " We are in a genuine relationship, " Harry pointed out ; running a hand through his curls, and surveying his boyfriend with ill-disguised panic, " It does n't matter what anyone else thinks because we 're in an actual relationship, and that 's all that bloody matters. " <p> Louis was quiet for a moment : his lips were parted ; his brow was furrowed. And when he spoke, his voice was small, " But do n't you get where I 'm coming from, Haz? " <p> The younger boy allowed a sigh to escape his lips, as he bent forward and pressed his face into Louis ' chest : the rapid beating of his boyfriend 's heart thumping against his forehead, as his muffled response came, " You 're scared of coming out? " <p> " You know I am, " Louis insisted, rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensing as he felt tremor run through the Cheshire boy. <p> Harry nodded, and straightened up. Maybe it was n't the explanation he 'd wanted to hear ; maybe he did n't need to fight his boyfriend, because, if Louis was scared, then all he needed to do was make sure he could be strong enough for both of them. <p> " I love you, Lou, " Harry whispered around the lump in his throat. <p> " I love you, too. " <p> xxxxxx <p> When they were back in London, away from -- well, for the better part -- the screaming fans, and the persistent paparazzi, things were better. Harry was happy. Things were n't perfect, and he 'd never expected them to be, but within the refuge of their shared apartment, everything was just a little bit easier to endure, and the air was just a little bit easier to breathe in. <p> Oh, and he had his Louis all to himself, so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of about twenty-four hours, in that period, they 'd done nothing but camp on the couch and shovel ice-cream down their throats while watching reruns of The Only Way Is Essex. It was domestic, it was boring, and Harry loved every moment of it. <p> And Louis seemed calm again ; normal, even. He was slightly jumpy, slightly uncomfortable, but he was Louis again. And that was all Harry needed. <p> They were sprawled over the sofa now : Louis was lounging against the arm ; a satisfied smirk skimming over his full lips, as he carded a lazy hand through Harry 's hair. Harry, in turn sighed into the touch ; his head was pillowed on his boyfriend 's chest, and his body was situated between Louis ' legs, and stretched over the length of the sofa. <p> " Hey, Lou, " the younger boy murmured ; sighing as Louis 's fingers tangled within his hair, " D' you know what would be fun? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoarse ululation of his voice accentuated by the tiny purr he 'd emanated the minute Harry had kissed his free hand. <p> Harry straightened up and straddled the elder 's lap ; completely mistaking the hitch in the latter 's breath as anticipation. Snaking his arms around Louis ' neck, he pressed his hands into the collar of Louis ' shirt, and allowed his fingertips to skim over the gold-tinged skin that stretched tight over layers of pure muscle and sinew. Diving in, he ghosted his mouth over Louis ' cheekbones ; his jaw line ; before pressing his lips gently onto the one spot on the older boy 's neck where the flesh lay thinnest : where the quickening of Louis ' pulse was most palpable. <p> " This, " Harry said ; the answer barely audible as he pressed he kissed a trail across his boyfriend 's jaw and nibbled at Louis ' ear : biting the lobe flat between his teeth. <p> Louis groaned ; and it had Harry smiling. But when he felt a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove him off, his smile evaporated, only to be replaced with a scowl. He wrenched away and fixated his eyes upon Louis ; outrage amalgamated with pain bubbled in the pit of his stomach, and yet minuscule part of him was n't surprised at all. <p> Harry ignored him, choosing instead to suck at the base of Louis ' neck : to suck ; and bite ; and lave his tongue over the bruised spot, before starting all over again. Louis ' protests had blurred into a litany in the background ; until he was pushed back so hard, that his back collided painfully against the arm of the sofa. <p> Harry bristled ; his voice eerily calm, even as the pounding of his heartbeat threatened to overwhelm him, " What the fuck, Louis? " <p> Louis flinched as Harry tried to claw at the waistband of his trousers ; a suppressed scream downing within his throat, and yet reverberating within the confines of the younger boy 's mind. <p> " No, just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to his feet, trembling slightly as he tried to absorb what Louis was trying to say, " It 's been a -- what the fuck do you mean by that? " <p> " I ca n't, Harry, " The reply came ; a quiver running deep as Louis spoke, " You said you understood how - " <p> " I understood that you did n't want to be close to me in public, but - " Harry began, only to swallow his own words. This could n't be happening. It could n't. " You did n't say you 'd stop - " <p> " Harry, I ca n't. I do n't want - " <p> " What about what I want?! " <p> " But I - " <p> " No, Louis, " The younger boy sliced through ; shaking his head in disbelief as he surveyed his boyfriend through a veil of tears, " It 's always about what you want, it 's always about you. I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted you to, I do n't know, love me, and be mine, because that 's all that I 've ever nee - " <p> " I do love you, Haz. " Louis interrupted ; looking up with blue eyes that screamed that they wanted to believe what he was saying, and yet -- yet Harry could see a hint of doubt stirring behind that cerulean gaze. <p> Harry scoffed ; hanging his head as he trained his eyes upon the floor -- as if every answer he wanted was inscribed upon it. <p> " You know, Lou, sometimes I wonder whether you actually mean that, or if it 's just convenient to say it. " <p> Scrubbing a hand over his visage, he stormed out of their apartment. He did n't know where he was running, even if he knew he wanted to run back. But when he did eventually go back, he was met with an empty flat ; with cold air suffused with the stale scent of Louis -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And I do love you, Harry. I love you more than anything, and you should know that by now. Lou. x <p> Xxxxx <p> Louis did n't see Harry again until they met up at Heathrow a week after their spat. So, fine, he was craven. Fine, he was just was n't ready. But anything -- anything at all -- was better than having Harry question whether or not he loved him. <p> He did love Harry -- he 'd always love Harry. But he was scared. He was scared beyond anything else, and he could n't help but flinch every time the younger boy approached him ; he could n't handle how fans all over the internet were predicting their every move ; how they knew he was Harry 's. <p> They did n't know, and yet they did. <p> Louis did n't know if that was dedication, or mere belief, but it hit home. <p> So he 'd run away to his childhood home to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbroken, even if he had no right to be. His sisters never asked why he was comatose ; why his brain registered only the fact that he was hurting Harry by saving himself : how he was sacrificing Harry to keep himself afloat. <p> Guilt had eroded his very being, and when he 'd seen Harry lope through Heathrow, Louis had felt his breath catch within his throat. The younger boy had halted the minute he 'd spied Louis : his expression had been so innocent ; so open, and yet Louis ' thoughts had been trained single-mindedly on the fact that he was the reason Harry had cracked. Harry never cracked. Harry never broke. Harry was the foundations upon which he still managed to stand, and yet Harry had crumbled right in front of him, when Louis, himself, was still standing. <p> The younger boy had donned an old pair of jeans and a white Henley, and he looked so young ; so angelic, and yet it was clear that demons haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry 's skin milky white skin had curdled ; his eyes were red rimmed and clouded ; his stance was of defeat. <p> Louis wanted to hug him ; to beg for forgiveness ; to pull him down into a fervent kiss and murmur sweet nothings ; to promise that they were going to be okay. <p> But he could n't do it. <p> Not when camera flashes went off around them ; not when fans screamed and wailed. He was still a coward. He was still unworthy of Harry. <p> The tedious flight to Brisbane had been uneventful. Louis had tried sneaking glances at Harry, but it was of no consequence : Harry was ignoring him ; Harry had receded back into his shell. <p> So it was a surprise that, when they were on their way to their hotel, Harry decided to speak up. A single, sable-polished minivan raced down the streets of Brisbane, with the night shining down upon it. Louis was sitting next to Zayn, opposite the other three boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, but when Harry had spoken, the air in the car had suddenly become viscous ; and Louis felt his throat clenching around words he would never find the ability to say. <p> " What are we, Louis? " Harry mumbled ; gazing out of the window ; his forehead plastered against the cool glass, " What are we now? " <p> Liam had tensed at that first ; his eyes growing wide as he whipped around to glance at Louis. Niall had merely twisted his lips into a frown, and had turned to Harry ; fixating him with a curious gaze. Zayn 's jaw had dropped open, but he did n't look surprised to hear the words ; he seemed aghast over the fact that Harry had actually said them. <p> " What d' you mean, Hazza? " Louis had tried to sound nonchalant, but he knew he was fooling no one. Gently stretching his leg, he bumped his foot against Harry 's shin. <p> Look at me, damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however. A spiteful grin played across the younger boy 's mouth ; anger rippling across his jade irises, as he retorted, " Are we even a couple? " <p> Oh, God, no. <p> Louis gulped ; his pulse an erratic thump in his ears ; in the crooks of his elbows, as the venom flavouring Harry 's words coursed through him, " Of course we are, Hazza. " <p> Harry physically responded at that. He turned to glare at Louis ; rage sparking over his face, " We 're a couple. You wo n't even let me touch you, but we 're a couple. " <p> " Harry, look, it was - " <p> " No, Louis, we 're not a couple. I was your little fuck-toy, and now I 'm not, because I 'm not going to let you string me along. " <p> " Harry, I - " <p> " I did everything for you, but you 're so scared of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut me away. " <p> As the car came to a halt outside their hotel, Harry wrenched the door open and stalked across the tarmac, and, as Louis watched the younger boy 's retreating figure, he could only think of one thing. <p> What have I done? <p> Xxxxxx <p> One day bled into two, and then into three, until Harry had lost count. They were at another radio interview, and all he wanted to do was go home, crawl into bed, and pretend as if the world did n't exist. But no, the grating voice of the interviewer was scratching at his nerves, and a deep-rooted headache had settled into the back of his neck ; his temples throbbing every time he deigned to partake in the conversation. <p> The truth was, he did n't know what to say anymore. He did n't have anything to say at all. <p> He could scream, but his screams would n't be wrought of words. They 'd be incoherent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was : he was the victim of his own need to love, and be loved, and yet that was a crime. <p> But Louis was fine, was n't he? He was smiling ; he was glowing ; he was n't drowning himself every night. Because Louis was... Louis was Louis. And Louis could move on. <p> " So, Louis, let 's talk about your lovely girlfriend, " the interviewer, wrenching Harry out of his reverie. The younger boy turned around quick enough to cause whiplash, but as he fixated the woman with a steely glare, she continued obliviously, " We 've heard you two are getting very serious. " <p> Louis chuckled ; a dulcet laugh that came so easy to him, and answered, " Yes, yes, we are. It 's been close to a year since we 've been dating. " <p> " We 've also heard a rumour that the two of you are moving in together -- is that true? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lives with me, you bint, he 'd never move out. He would n't. <p> Harry 's eyes roved over to where Louis was sitting between Niall and Zayn ; a smile was splayed over the older boy 's full lips, but Harry could n't tell if it was euphoric, or apologetic. His gaze was focussed on the interviewer, never shifting to see Harry. <p> No, Louis, you -- you would n't... you 'd never. <p> " That 's true, actually, " the Tyke answered ; nodding for emphasis, as his smile grew wider. Harry felt inexplicably numb ; unable to differentiate whether the scene was a nightmare, or reality. <p> The interviewer, however, went on ; congratulating Louis, " That 's amazing to hear! But are n't you the messiest? She 'll have a lot to deal with. " <p> " She will, but she can handle it. " Louis extolled, shrugging, but smiling as Zayn shoved him playfully. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he could n't contain his shock ; his disbelief. The woman -- Anna, her name was, or maybe Marie, or something -- noticed his reaction and opined, " But Louis, it must definitely mean less of a mess, right? Now that you 'll be living with a girl, instead of Harry. " <p> At that, Louis ' eyes met his : the cerulean orbs were laced with regret ; desolation, and something Harry could n't quite place. When he spoke, the younger boy felt the words sing through him : <p> " No, I 'm the mess, and I always have been. Harry 's perfect. " <p> Xxxxxx <p> Slamming the door of the suite open, Harry stalked inside -- their shared suite making life difficult as hell -- as he silently pondered over the fresh scrap of information that was sinking deep within him. <p> Louis was leaving. <p> Had their relationship deteriorated to the point where they had to be sliced apart? Where causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strangle every bit of his resolve out of him? <p> Loving was like poison, Harry knew. It was a slow poison ; it was deadlier than the quick stroke of a knife, and yet you died all the same. He 'd been infected from head to toe, and was paying the price. <p> Taking a seat on the first sofa that obstructed his path, Harry rested his elbows atop his knees, and buried his face into his hands : trying his hardest to keep calm ; to keep his cool. But it was of no use ; trying was of no use, when he knew he was cracking ; he knew his wound had been ripped open, and blood was going to flow through, whether he wanted it to or not. <p> When the door reopened, Louis walked in : his hair was slightly dishevelled, as if he 'd been tugging at it, and his visage had lost its pallor. Spying Harry, he stopped and stared. And Harry could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and his body was refusing to stay still as another suppressed sob wracked his body, but he maintained the eye-lock as if it was everything in the world to him. <p> " Harry? " <p> " You 're going to leave me, Lou? " <p> He hated how petulant he sounded, but he had every reason to. Harry 's eyebrows knitted together as he shook his head, unable to grasp the basis of how, and why, and when, because this was n't Louis. This could n't be his Louis. His Louis would never leave him, no matter what. <p> " No, Haz, look, " Louis began ; his breathing was uneven, and Harry revelled in it, " It 's just for a while -- just to help us cool down whatever it is that 's been going down between us. " <p> " Whatever it is that 's been going down between us?! " Harry spat back incredulously, hysteria highlighting his words, " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now you 're just going to leave me?! " <p> Louis groaned, the noise emanated from his throat as he ran an impatient hand through his feathery hair, " It 's not permanent, Harry, it 's just - " <p> Clambering to his feet and scoffing in disbelief, Harry stepped closer to Louis ; his eyes narrowing in anger, even as tear-tracks stroked his cheeks, " That 's not it? That 's not it, Louis?! That is it. You 're too much of a coward to - " <p> " It 's not easy! " <p> Harry 's jaw dropped open ; tears journeying down his visage, and he shivered, searching the man in front of him for some trace of the man he was in love with. <p> " It 's not meant to be easy, " he answered, the strength to scream having fled him, " It 's never been easy to be with you, but I did everything I could. I never complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was -- I am in love with you. No, it 's not easy, but it 's not supposed to be this fucking hard. " <p> Louis stared at him, and Harry cracked harder under that gaze : his resolve was sloughed away into nonexistence, and he could n't help as he cried. The older boy sighed, " I love you, too, Harry, and you have to know that. " <p> " Do I? " Harry shot back ; his voice barely audible, and yet echoing within the room, " Do you know what love is, Louis? Love is that feeling when a person 's mere existence makes everything better. Everything 's bearable, and nothing 's impossible, because you know that one person 's going to be there to catch you when you fall. " <p> Harry paused, not trusting himself to go on without sobs punctuating every syllable. <p> " But, Lou, I fell. And you just let me. " <p> Standing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to the other 's face. But Louis flinched -- he goddamn flinched -- and stumbled backwards. As if Harry was poison. As if Harry was n't his. <p> Nodding, Harry made to leave, before the Doncaster boy spoke up ; his words quiet and strained, " Haz, please do n't go. " <p> He did n't listen. He walked a few more steps, before the words came again. <p> " Harry, please. Please, please, just stay. " <p> " Make me stay, Louis, " Harry whispered ; sniffling, but not turning back to lock gazes. He would n't last if he did. He 'd succumb. <p> Glancing back, Harry took in the picture of Louis Tomlinson : his everything, and yet his doom. His life, and yet his death. <p> " You 're not going to make me stay, are you? " <p> He did n't wait for a response, he did n't wait for something he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny foyer, Harry exited the suite, and slammed the door behind him. <p> Louis Tomlinson did n't move, until he collapsed on the sofa. Louis Tomlinson cried, when he could have reclaimed what would always be his. Louis Tomlinson was still a coward. And if he 'd run after his boyfriend ; if he 'd bothered to do anything, he would have found a crumpled Harry Styles curled up on the floor outside the suite : sobbing, and shaking, with his eyes bloodshot, and his breathing erratic. <p> Because while Louis Tomlinson had given up all hope, Harry Styles had still been waiting for someone to catch him. <p> xxxxx <p> It had been three weeks, and as Louis watched the sunlight filter in through the window, he could n't help but spitefully muse over the fact that even sunlight had lost its lustre ; its warmth. It was hilarious how nothing in the world made sense anymore, and yet nothing had changed. <p> Pulling the purple hoodie closer around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his bedcovers once more ; clenching his eyes shut when he remembered what he had done. It had been three weeks since he 'd flown home from Australia and proceeded to hole himself up in his mother 's house, and yet the memory of Harry realising that Louis was n't everything he 'd expected him to be was shattering ; it was frightening. <p> And he did n't know how much longer he could handle it. <p> The bedroom creaked open to reveal his mother standing there with a pitying expression splayed across her visage and a steaming mug clutched in one hand. <p> " Could we talk, Lou? " Jay began, padding over to her son 's bed, and slumping down against the headboard. Nimbly, she handed him the mug. <p> " Sure, Ma, " Louis mumbled, half-heartedly smiling in thanks as he sipped at the tea, savouring the warmth that spread through him for the first time in three weeks, " What 's up? " <p> Jay critically analysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sighed, " Why are you doing this, Lou? " <p> " Doing what? " <p> " I know you love Harry. You know you love Harry. Why are you doing this? " <p> Because I 'm scared? Because I 'm stupid? Because you did n't raise a son who fights for what he wants. <p> " Mum, I - " Louis trailed off with a shrug, staring into the depths of the mug instead of meeting his mother 's interrogatory gaze, " I 'm just scared of what... the fans, and all. " <p> " Louis, look at me. " Jay demanded ; her voice soft, and yet the stern undertone of authority was unmistakeable. Louis ' eyes flitted to find hers immediately. " The fans, you say? Did distancing yourself from Harry do any good? Did they think you are n't a couple? " <p> No, they 're too dedicated for that. Louis shook his head. <p> " Then were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing yourself from Harry? " <p> Never. He shook his head again. <p> " Then what are you still doing here? " <p> Louis ' eye widened ; his mouth was slack, as he queried, " Huh? " <p> " I was talking to Anne, " His mother extolled, " And we reckon that if you distancing yourself from Harry 's doing absolutely nothing to stop the rumours of Larry Stylinson being real, and whatnot, then what brand of idiot have I given birth to that ca n't realise that he 's unnecessarily hurting himself and the boy he loves. " <p> There was a pause, and then -- <p> " Shit, Mum, I have to go! " <p> " That 's my boy. " <p> xxxxx <p> It was raining in Holmes Chapel. Or, as Harry had declared, he was crying so much, that God had decided to recycle his tears and shower them down upon his native town. Rain fell down in sheets : tapping against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village as the wind howled through it ; as lightning sliced within. <p> Harry was huddled up on the couch : a blanket was wrapped tight around him, as he shovelled another forkful of leftover lasagne into his mouth ; and his eyes barely registered the morning show they were glued to. <p> He did n't like to think. Everything was better when he did n't think about it. Because everything was a painful reminder of Louis. <p> From the vase in his mother 's kitchen, to the sweater he was wearing. Because Louis had picked out that vase for Anne 's birthday, and it was Louis ' sweater. Everything was Louis, because Louis was his everything. <p> Even now. <p> Swallowing his bite, Harry was in the process of forcing more down his throat, when the doorbell rang. <p> Let them die out there in the rain. <p> It was probably a fan -- most of them thought it was cute to convene in phalanxes around his childhood home. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door without being mobbed by screaming girls. <p> Not that he wanted to leave the house, anyway. <p> The doorbell rang again. <p> Shifting slightly, the curly haired boy glanced at the front door -- the white painted mahogany separating him and the outside world. Stuffing his mouth with a huge bite of lasagne, he rose and shuffled towards the gate. <p> And then the doorbell rang again. <p> Allowing an irritated sigh to pass his lips, Harry wrenched the door open. Only to be greeted with the shivering figure of Louis Tomlinson : the older boy was standing on the porch ; his hands gripped at the sleeves of his soaked, navy sweater, and his hair was plastered to his head, as he swayed on the spot. <p> " Harry, I - " <p> Without a second thought, Harry slammed the door shut in Louis ' face. <p> This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. I 've progressed to having full-on hallucinations. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> The doorbell rang once more. <p> Jumping, Harry opened the door again. Louis was still there. <p> " Haz, I - " Louis began, only to trail off with a sneeze, " Haz, I love you. " <p> I 'm dreaming. That makes sense. <p> Harry opened his mouth, but the words dried up at the back of his throat. So he merely stared. <p> Louis smiled : a radiant grin that knifed through the encasement of dread around Harry, as he muttered, " I love you so much, Harry. I was a dick -- I was a huge dick, and I 'm sorry. " <p> Harry stayed quiet ; opting to stare through wide, green eyes. <p> " Haz, are you - " <p> " Come here, " Harry interrupted and grabbed a fistful of Louis ' shirt and pulled him close ; wasting no time in attaching their mouths in a fervent lip-lock. It was carnal, and yet sourced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; forming a single orifice as they strived to feel more. <p> It was Louis who moved away first -- his eyebrows shooting up under the refuge of his damp fringe, as he opined, " Seriously? You 're going to forgive me that easily? " <p> Laughing, Harry pulled the smaller boy closer ; snaking one arm around his waist and stationing a hand at the small of his back : his fingertips digging slightly to hold him in place. Raking his free hand through Louis ' tendrils, and smoothing his palm over the elder 's cheek, Harry
