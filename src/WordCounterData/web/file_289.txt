5055641 <h> Review from Jay W. <p> These people ripped off a family member on a couple of consignment pieces. Same deal as the other consignor/reviewer. They got a few pieces in the store and when no word came after a few weeks, they disavowed any knowledge( played stupid) when phone inquiries were made as to status. IMO they intentionally try to frustrate sellers hoping they will eventually just become disheartened and give up. Anyway another family member went in to look for the pieces after several weeks of runaround. One was MISSING, the other was marked SOLD. They claimed the missing one had been given away to charity even though the contract floor time had n't expired! <h> Review from martin c. <p> Brutal experience. This started out ok and went south fast. Bob or Rob I forgot his name came by one day to see what I was hoping to get rid of &; I told him what I had hoped on getting or at least asking and we agreed on some # 's. I told him that if he had a ny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call. Well I had nt heard from them in about 6 weeks and did nt get either of my calls returned and it turns out that they decided to sell my things for whatever they felt like without consulting me the customer.They were also told to consult me prior to lowering any prices which they did not. The worst was they sold a cherry top table that was refinished a year ago and beautiful they aledgedly sold for $39.00 opposed to the $250 asking price we had discussed. Fot that price $19 that i got I would have broke it up and put it in my fire pit. They paid me 6 weeks after the last piece sold and kept reitterating that nobody every has had any complaints, i find that hard to beleive. They Suck!!! <h> Review from Liz C. <p> I loved this place. You can tell when people love what they do. I bought multiple pieces from them. Their merchandise is well cared for and from smoke free homes. I was very happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @
