5028941 <h> From the Mailbag <p> I have heard and read from several different sources the story that John F. Kennedy made a major German language blunder in his famous " Ich bin ein Berliner " speech in Berlin, Germany. The story goes that he should have said " Ich bin Berliner "( " I am a citizen of Berlin "), and that " Ich bin ein Berliner " really means " I am a jelly doughnut.

Notwithstanding reports to the contrary in venues as prestigious as the New York Times and Newsweek magazine, this is truly The Gaffe That Never Was. Experts say Kennedy 's grammar was flawless when he uttered those words on June 26, 1963. The phrase was translated for him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in some parts of Germany the word Berliner can just as well denote a certain kind of jelly-filled pastry as a citizen of Berlin, but look at it this way : if I were to tell a group of Americans that my editor is a New Yorker, would any of them really think I 'd
