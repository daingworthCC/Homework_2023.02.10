5042741 <h> Euclid 's proof that there are infinitely many primes <p> by John on February 13, 2010 <p> Paul Erd? s had this notion that God kept a book of the best proofs. Erd? s called God 's book simply " the book. " Springer recently published Proofs from THE BOOK, a collection of elegant proofs that the authors suppose might be in God 's book. <p> For many mathematicians, the first proof that comes to mind as a candidate for a proof in the book is Euclid 's proof that there are infinitely many primes. The proof is so short and simple that it can almost be written within the 140-character limit of Twitter. I give the proof in my AlgebraFact Twitter account as follows. <p> There are infinitely many primes. Proof : If not, multiply all primes together and add 1. Now you 've got a new prime. <p> Several people pointed out that I was a little too terse. If N is the supposed product of all primes + 1, N itself does n't have to be a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a new prime. The smallest prime factor of N must be a prime not on the list. Either way " you 've got a new prime, " but the proof above leaves out some important details. <p> Here 's an example. Suppose we believed the only primes were 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Let N = 2*3*5*7*11*13 + 1 = 30031. Now N can not be divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 because there is a remainder of 1 when dividing N by any of these numbers. Maybe N is a new prime, or maybe N is composite but N has a prime factor not on our list. The latter turns out to be the case : 30031 = 59*509. <p> If you can find a better summary of Euclid 's proof in 140 characters or less, please leave it in the
