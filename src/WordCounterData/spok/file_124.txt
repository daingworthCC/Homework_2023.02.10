241941 @!ANDREI-CODRESCU-A : Last week, I was a traitor. This week, I 'm a patriot. An amazing new decade is beginning. TED KOPPEL : voice-over For this man, going home was more than a journey ; it was a rite of passage into a nation being reborn. Tonight, a very special look at Romania, from an exile who just made his first return in 24 years. And from some of those who stayed behind. Among our guests : the head of Romanian television and the last political prisoner released from Romania 's death row before the Communist dictatorship collapsed @!ANNOUNCER This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from Washington, Ted Koppel @!KOPPEL Only three weeks ago, Nicolae Ceausescu was still presiding over Romania 's Politburo. Stenographers ' notes from that meeting were published today in a Romanian newspaper, quoting the late dictator as threatening his military commanders with the firing squad because their men had been shooting at demonstrators with blanks, rather than live ammunition. Since that time, the National Salvation Front, which now rules Romania, has scheduled national elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the freedom to travel abroad, has freed all political prisoners, has ended the rationing of energy and the export of food. And those are just a few of the changes. The transformation of Romania has been breathtaking. Imagine, then, what it must have been like for an American writer and poet born and raised in Romania, but one who has lived and worked here for the past 24 years, to return in the middle of those changes to the place of his birth. Andrei Codrescu, who is a regular commentator for National Public Radio, also compiled a few of his impressions and dreams for Nightline. @!ANDREI-CODRESCU-A : I will tell you my fantasy of return. I am very famous, you see. I 've just won the Nobel Prize or something. It is late summer or early fall. The linden trees are in flower, the sidewalk cafes are full of people drinking new wine, eating smoky sausages, talking loud, laughing. Pretty girls are strolling up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Cadillac convertible driven by a beautiful hermaphrodite in a white uniform. My silk scarf is flying high behind me. There is a stack of my books piled casually in the back seat. We come to a stop in front of the famous Capsa literary cafe, where the leading lights of Romanian literature have been gathering for over a century. Among the throng of worshipers is an old man who comes forward to greet me, his arms open, tears flowing down his venerable cheeks. When he steps close, I deck him. The old man is my horrible stepfather, who once told me I would never amount to anything. That 's one fantasy of return to one 's place of birth, a fairly common one. But here I am, 24 years later, and things, as you can see, are quite different. But my heart is full, and I am happy. The deserted town that you see is, in fact, as beautiful to me as if the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free. This is a better return than if all the poets and the stepfathers had come to greet me. The sight of the Romanian flag with the socialist emblem cut out of it makes my heart beat faster. In 1956, at the time of the Hungarian revolution, when I was 10 years old, I wrote on the wall in a childish hand, " Long live the Hungarian revolution! " Today, I see the writing of the students of Bucharest on the wall. Translating Romanian phrases " I hear the bullets, invisible butterflies that will return into the bodies of those that fed on our country. Young people, defend your objectives. " " Father Christmas came this year to Romania. " " This is how the criminals will burn. " " We are not afraid, " the crude, handwritten sign says above a Marxist shrine. They won their revolution. The books of all those literary lights gathered at Capsa once upon a time were all here. So were the invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something else here, too, namely, a very young me, writing poems at those long readers ' tables, sneaking sidelong glances at the unbearably intelligent and beautifully unapproachable face of the young woman studying philosophy two seats away. They did n't burn her face from my memory. The books will be replaced. Yesterday, at the border, the guard looked at my Romanian name on my American passport, and said, " Are you coming back home? " " Yes, " I said. She turned to one of her fellow officers. " You see, I told you, the patriots are coming back. " Last week I was a traitor. This week I 'm a patriot. An amazing new decade is beginning. It is a bittersweet return, bitter because this freedom was bought with blood. I was not here for the two decades of hardly conceivable misery under the Ceausescu tyranny. " We did n't have a single gram of meat for five years, " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lived in the dark. " The darkness has lifted, but the homes are still cold. It will be a long time before a normal life, or at least what I, an American, think of as normal, returns to Romania. But the warmth, the openness, the courage of this revolution will keep be coming back. I did n't find all my youth here, but I found the best part of it. I found the language of my youth being freely spoken. Amid the intoxication of liberty, Romanians know that they will have to examine, think and test everything again. That is one gift of this return, among many others, that I can put to personal and immediate use. This is Andrei Codrescu for Nightline in Bucharest @!KOPPEL Andrei Codrescu is back in the United States now, and joins us live tonight from our affiliate WVUE in New Orleans. How long, Andrei, do you think before the euphoria of this newfound freedom gives way to the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Author : I 've already seen signs of the euphoria disappearing. People do n't trust Communists in Romania any longer. Many of the members of the fronts are Communists, and it will take a long time before anything emerges that will have the trust of the majority of Romanians. People are suspecting that the revolution is being stolen, that the old bureaucrats are slipping back into their jobs @!KOPPEL It was a very personal reminiscence that you recorded for us. What was, for you, the most emotional thing about going back? Mr. CODRESCU : It was hearing the language that I left behind 25 years ago, seeing the places, physically being in a country I 'd been afraid to go back to, and seeing the people and seeing them speak in ways that I could not imagine that they could before. It was a poetic experience, one that was profoundly emotional and personal @!KOPPEL How isolated, Andrei, were the people over the last 20-some-odd years? In other words, how much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. CODRESCU : They received most of their news from Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America, and from whatever things that people could smuggle in. When I was an adolescent there, I had a cousin who smuggled in some tapes of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and we listened to those, but everything was very, very deeply buried. People whispered. Everything was known through innuendo and rumor, and through word of mouth. I used to sit in breadlines to get bread. And my mother sent me there not just to get the bread, but to hear the news @!KOPPEL Andrei Codrescu, thank you very much for doing that lovely piece for us in Romania, and welcome back home again. Mr. CODRESCU : Thank you @!KOPPEL When we come back, the remarkable role that television played in the upheaval in Romania. We 'll talk with the head of Romanian television today, and we 'll be joined by a former Romanian diplomat convicted of treason and sentenced to death when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break KOPPEL : Romanian television not only played a role in the nation 's political upheaval, it was literally part of the battleground. Correspondent Jackie Judd reports from Bucharest now on how television was utilized by both sides. JACKIE JUDD, ABC News : voice-over In his final days, the dictator Ceausescu used television as he always had, to prop up his regime. The televised rally was staged : Securitate, secret police, in the front, silent masses forced to attend behind them. When Ceausescu called it " a popular meeting, " the silence turned to jeers, and the cameras turned away. Finally, the transmission was cut, and within 24 hours the people who learned from Ceausescu how useful television could be were themselves in front of the cameras. AUREL DRAGOS MUNTEANU, Executive Director Romanian Television : The television did n't do the revolution. It supported it. The revolution was done by the Romanian people @!JUDD voice-over Including Aurel Dragos Munteanu, a dissident and now executive director of radio and television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worst fighting took place. The Securitate desperately wanted it. Mr. MUNTEANU : And they knew that the media is powerful force and that the contact with the people is essential @!JUDD voice-over And so did the opposition. It stayed on the air constantly. Munteanu says it was the first revolution televised as it happened. Mr. MUNTEANU : People have seen on TV screens that masses of workers and of students are controlling the streets. The TV showed very well that the possibility becomes a reality, the possibility of the revolution, step by step becomes a reality @!JUDD voice-over When Ceausescu 's son appeared on TV, captured and terrified, some say the resolve of the Securitate began to wane, and later the trial and execution of Ceausescu himself was played over and over again, to convince the people they had won and the Securitate they had lost. on camera Since the revolution, those most dedicated to Ceausescu have been removed from the television station, but some old faces remain, and now there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be, and who should have access to it. voice-over The peasant party complains that it 's being shut out, that television has become the tool of the new provisional government and of the main political party, the National Salvation Front. VALENTIN GABRIELESCU, Peasant Party Spokesman : They are the same men, the same words, the same mentality @!JUDD voice-over Munteanu, who in addition to running state television is also the Front spokesman, says Romania needs some time. Mr. MUNTEANU : We are at the very beginning of a long revolutionary process. We have to learn. Democracy has to be learned @!JUDD voice- over On tonight 's news, there was n't much reported about Romania 's new political order. There was a story about Ceausescu 's use of inflated production figures. Hatred of Ceausescu fueled the revolution, and those in charge now have to find something positive to replace that with. This is Jackie Judd for Nightline, in Bucharest @!KOPPEL Joining us now live from Bucharest is the man who currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spokesman for the National Salvation Front political party, Aurel Dragos Munteanu. Mr. Munteanu, you have an election coming up in April. In this country, television is a terribly important part of the election process. Who will get access to television over the next few weeks, to campaign? AUREL DRAGOS MUNTEANU, Executive Director Romanian Television : All political forces. First of all, the TV station, the company, does n't belong to anybody. The Front is not a political party. It 's a platform that will unify all political tendencies and political parties and organizations that will join freely on the basis of negotiations, and it will have only an electoral platform for the elections @!KOPPEL But you understand what I 'm saying. Someone has to exercise control, someone has to give access. There are only so many hours of television in a day. Who will decide who gets how much time? Mr. MUNTEANU : We will decide at the TV station. We will start the experience of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then, on an equal basis, all political parties will have free access to the station. And they will release news. Our program is freedom of information. And on that basis the people will be informed in order to make their choice and to elect a democratic government, and to go to the polls as we think that they have to get all the information in order to make their choice. There is not a political party with the name of the front of the National Salvation, sir @!KOPPEL One of the things I wanted to ask you is, when you talk about, for example, providing the news on television these days, most Romanians have not had any experience with the free process of collecting and disseminating news, with the process of journalism. Where are your journalists coming from, and where have they learned their trade? Mr. MUNTEANU : That 's indeed a problem, sir. They were educated under Ceausescu, and they still have sometimes tendencies of making propaganda. Myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States. To me the First Amendment is the Bible for doing free journalism and exercising the right of information. It will be a process of educating those people and providing them with all the means of free journalism. We- as I mentioned it before, we are starting a long process and have to learn democracy @!KOPPEL Mr. Munteanu, if you 'd be good enough to stand by, we 'll be back to you a little bit later in the broadcast. When we return, we 'll be joined by a leading former Romanian political dissident, Mircea Raceanu, who was released from a death row cell as the Ceausescu regime collapsed. Commercial break KOPPEL : In a sense, we are telling you the story of Romania tonight through the eyes of three men, the third of whom, Mircea Raceanu, is a Romanian career diplomat who was convicted of treason and sentenced to death by the Ceausescu regime last July, after he was linked to a letter critical of the government 's repressive measures. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too silly to be true. You were convicted, you were sentenced to death, for writing a letter? What did you say in the letter? MIRCEA RACEANU, former Romanian Political Prisoner : I was, as you told, a career diplomat for almost 30 years. I was arrested by Ceausescu regime. I was charged for treason. I was sentenced to death by a military court during the trial, which took place in Bucharest on the 20th and 21st of July. Yes, I opposed Ceausescu for many years. This dictatorship, which isolated Romania, they- as far as the letter is concerned, you know that six people wrote a letter, an open letter, against Ceausescu regime. One of the signatures of that letter was my father. The day before I was arrested, I was talking with my father about this letter, about the whole action @!KOPPEL And for that you were sentenced to death? Mr. RACEANU : No, I said I have been charged with treason, betraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romania. I always made a very straight distinction between what Romania is, the national interest of Romania and the Romanian people, and what Ceausescu always thought, that he is Romania, that this interest is only his interest, his family interest. And yes, I betrayed him. He personally recognized that. And he wanted to give up every- KOPPEL : Tell me- Mr. RACEANU : -and he considered always that everybody who betrays him, his policy, is considered a traitor @!KOPPEL -if you can, make the story- personalize it for us a little bit, so that we have a sense- what was it like inside a Romanian prison under Ceausescu? Mr. RACEANU : It was a nightmare. It 's very difficult for me to speak about those days, about the trial, the days I spent in prison. I hope you all understand that. But I can tell you that in the last two days, when I was in prison, I felt that something is happening outside, and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big crowd watched the prison and I heard for myself that they shouted, " Liberty, liberty, freedom! " I understood that nightmare, the Ceausescu regime, that nightmare was over @!KOPPEL Tell me, if you want, from a purely personal point of view or, if you like, from a more professional point of view, whether you think the Romanian people are going to be able to treat with leniency and understanding the people who have oppressed them for so many years. Mr. RACEANU : Who have been- I did n't quite understand @!KOPPEL Who have oppressed the Romanian people from- in other words, there is a danger now that there will be a lot of revenge-seeking. Mr. RACEANU : No, I am very confident in the Romanian people, and what the young generation did in Romania. This revolution proved the vitality of the Romanian people. I am confident that the Romanian people will deal with these people who oppressed us for many, many years, will be tried by justice, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to speak to Mr. Munteanu again for just one moment, and perhaps you can give us a sense, as we close out this program now, how many people died, how many people were injured, how many people are still missing? Mr. MUNTEANU : The initial estimation was that we had about 60,000 casualties. This was indeed unofficial, but now we try to figure it out. We do n't know it yet. The country was in a turmoil, and we do n't have the exact figures. It 's about that, anyway, you know. It was a real tragedy. The Securitate opposed us with arms and they stirred quite a big trouble around, shooting at random, killing children, attacking hospitals, and unarmed people on the streets @!KOPPEL Mr. Munteanu, forgive me for interrupting. I know as a fellow broadcaster you understand. I 'm afraid we are out of time. But I thank all of you very much for being on our broadcast tonight, and I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, gentlemen. We 'll have a program note when we return in a moment. Commercial break
