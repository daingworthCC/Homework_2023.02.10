The name of the song is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it 's performed by samba star Thiaguinho and featuring rapper Projota. it 's kind of catchy. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Wow. @!NATALIE-MORALES# it all -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# See all those things -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah, it 's good. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Let 's just rerack that. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# That was amazing. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Alma e Coraao, that 's all you need to know. So hard. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I like it 's catchy. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# It 's a good song. I like those international songs. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yes. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Remember, Shakira did the World Cup song. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Mm-Hm. @!WILLIE-GEIST# And that kind of caught on. These are good -- these are good songs. @!NATALIE-MORALES# it 's -- it 's good that it sort of builds the atmosphere but it 's also introducing -- I mean it 's not just samba. Now they 're bringing in a little rap too it also @!WILLIE-GEIST# Right. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Right. Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Right. @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's cool. @!DYLAN-DREYER# And it gets you excited for where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know, it kind of brings it all together. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Thirty-two days. All right. @!WILLIE-GEIST# All right, wow. Start learning Portuguese. @!DYLAN-DREYER# So there 's this story about these interns. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Okay. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Right. And there -- an intern at a company that we do n't actually know which company -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Right. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- it is but they were unhappy with the dress code. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Okay. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Okay. @!DYLAN-DREYER# It was a little too formal. They complained it was a little -- little too stuffy. And so the interns told the story to this advice site column it 's called Ask A Manager and they said that even though that their division does n't deal with clients and other people that they have this very strict dress code. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Okay. @!DYLAN-DREYER# So they submitted this proposal, this petition because they wanted to wear sandals. They did n't want to wear leather flats. They wanted to wear non-leather flats. And the next day they were pulled into a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of all of them? @!NATALIE-MORALES# What? Because of -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# They got rid of all of them -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Wow. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- because of unprofessional behavior. @!NATALIE-MORALES# So it got us talking about this. @!DYLAN-DREYER# So it got me thinking -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Like if you 're an intern -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- if you 're an intern -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- I feel like you really have no pull whatsoever. Right? @!NATALIE-MORALES# No, I mean -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Right. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I always -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# I mean I feel like you just kind of go -- go with the rules. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yes. As an intern I was always told, you know, dress for the job you want, not necessarily the job you have. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Mm-Hm. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Right. @!NATALIE-MORALES# And it 's about, you know, playing this part and being that part of that company -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# Right. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- and their culture. So you have to kind of assimilate along with the culture. And you 're right. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be complaining. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# No. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# it depends a little bit what the company was maybe. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yes. @!WILLIE-GEIST# We 're trying to take their side of it. If it was -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# If it was like a laid back company -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yes. @!WILLIE-GEIST# It 's a Wall Street firm, you do n't want to be walking around in your sneakers probably. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Right. @!WILLIE-GEIST# But if it 's a chill like startup -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Right. @!WILLIE-GEIST# -- maybe they just wanted to dress like the people who work there. I do n't know. But that 's that. @!DYLAN-DREYER# But it does n't sound like it was a company like that. @!WILLIE-GEIST# As an intern -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# -- that 's certainly the way I just showed up and said tell me what to do. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I know. @!WILLIE-GEIST# And how to do it. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I will do anything. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Right. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# And everything you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I will make sure it 's like that. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Exactly. @!NATALIE-MORALES# And we did everything just to get that experience. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# So -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# I 'm sorry. I 'm looking over your shoulder because something bizarre coming. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I 'm a little nervous about this. I 'm trying to procrastinate on this one a little bit. @!NATALIE-MORALES# What is this? @!WILLIE-GEIST# Jerry, what are you doing -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# Because there is -- there 's a very strange hot dog creation that -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, a hot dog creation. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- we have to try. So it 's -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Wait. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- it 's hot dog infused ice cream. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, this does not sound good at all. @!WILLIE-GEIST# No. @!DYLAN-DREYER# You have to eat -- there is -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# And you 're pregnant. You probably could n't eat anything. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I know. I ca n't. And this just does n't sound that interesting to me. @!NATALIE-MORALES# So wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream as a hot dog. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Yes. Ice cream infused hot dog. It 's by DBGB Cool Dog. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Is this a prank? @!DYLAN-DREYER# It 's -- it 's got candied cabbage on top. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, it smells like a hot dog. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Honey mustard -- honey mustard and fruity ketchup. But it 's on a toasted brioche bun. It 's seven dollars and fifty cents from DBGB Kitchen and Bar. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Who 's going to give it a try? @!DYLAN-DREYER# And Morgenstern 's Finest Ice Cream. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I 'm just saying ice cream should be ice cream and hot dog should be hot dogs. Like there 's no need to have an ice cream hot dog. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I 'm scared -- I 'm scared to try. @!WILLIE-GEIST# You- -you first. @!DYLAN-DREYER# All right. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Is that actual mustard on the -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# No, it 's honey mustard. @!WILLIE-GEIST# -- ice cream? Put on ice cream. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I 'm sorry. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Oh, my God. @!NATALIE-MORALES# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- seriously is this a prank. Where 's the thing? No. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Oh, my God. @!WILLIE-GEIST# No, it 's real. It 's real. We should say, today is the last day it 's for sale. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, my gosh. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Thank God, Dylan says. But there are four -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# I 'm sorry. @!WILLIE-GEIST# -- other limited edition flavors available throughout July. @!NATALIE-MORALES# There are people who put a lot of thought into this. It was not good. @!WILLIE-GEIST# She 's just sneezing. It 's fine. It 's not because of the food. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Right here, Dylan. Little bit on the chin. It did kind of- - it 's like a cold, slimy hot dog, which takes me back -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Which reminds me -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- which takes me back to -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# Wow. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- one of our finest Fourth of July hosting moments -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- here on the TODAY Show. Remember this, Willie? @!WILLIE-GEIST# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set it up for us. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Okay. So we were reminiscing. Natalie and I were hosting the show four years ago and we had a hot dog eating contest because Joey Chestnut, the hot dog eating champion, Sonya Thomas were there. We had a contest. Natalie won because she threw it over her shoulder. I put them in my pocket. We were trying to get through them. But that 's not where the story really gets good. @!NATALIE-MORALES# No. No, this is where the story gets good. What you do n't see on the other side of the camera is the entire crew. They 're like no, no, do n't eat them. The hot dogs were not cooked. @!WILLIE-GEIST# They were not cooked. The -- the crew was waving us off. Do n't eat them. @!NATALIE-MORALES# They 're like stop. @!WILLIE-GEIST# And we said, I know, was n't this fun. @!NATALIE-MORALES# We 're like it 's so good. @!WILLIE-GEIST# We thought they were throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine. @!WILLIE-GEIST# These were not cooked hot dogs. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Were you guys not supposed to eat them? @!WILLIE-GEIST# They were just -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# They were -- no. @!WILLIE-GEIST# -- display dogs. @!DYLAN-DREYER# So why did you guys -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# I do n't know. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- turn it into a hot dog eating contest? @!WILLIE-GEIST# I do n't think we turned it in. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I do n't know. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Or maybe we wanted to join in. I ca n't remember. @!NATALIE-MORALES# We wanted Joey to like -- I do n't know. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# But anyway -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# So we -- we -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# We decided to eat some. @!WILLIE-GEIST# It made for a long Fourth of July. @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's just so -- it was very uncomfortable. @!DYLAN-DREYER# So, would you rather have uncooked hot dogs or hot dogs -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Uncooked hot dogs. @!NATALIE-MORALES# I 'd say the uncooked hot -- I 'm sorry again -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# I know. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- to DBGB 's, whatever. @!WILLIE-GEIST# I 'm sure they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They -- they have a lot of cool -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# -- other flavors. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# That are like regular, you know, tropical flavors and stuff. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# That 's much better. @!DYLAN-DREYER# This one is just for the Fourth of July. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Stick to the tropics. @!WILLIE-GEIST# It 's for a particular -- I 'm told our producer Mike Greenfield likes it though. Is that true? Or do you just saying that? @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# No, I did like it. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Here, have it. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Really? @!WILLIE-GEIST# Please. @!DYLAN-DREYER# it was honey mustard. @!NATALIE-MORALES# By all means, finish mine. @!DYLAN-DREYER# it 's the honey mustard that got me. @!WILLIE-GEIST# It 's the mustard on ice cream thing. @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# I -- I will -- I will eat it. @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's the -- it 's the sour crowd on ice cream. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Well, that too. @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# Well, can I eat one that you have n't taken a bite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yes. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Trust me. I did n't take a bite. @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# Here we go. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh. And it really is that good? @!WILLIE-GEIST# What do you like about it, honestly? @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's like cold -- @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# It tastes a little bit like a hot dog but it 's still got the ice cream and the bun is good. This is great. @!NATALIE-MORALES# The ice cream, the hot dog -- @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# This is fantastic. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- the mustard. @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# Fantastic. It 's great. @!WILLIE-GEIST# You can have some more. @( Cross talking) @!NATALIE-MORALES# All right. @!MIKE-GREENFIELD# I 'll eat the rest of it over here. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah, serve it up to the crew. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I feel so bad I did n't like it. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!DYLAN-DREYER# But -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# you spoke for a lot of people this morning. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. so. @!WILLIE-GEIST# All right.

We are with some old friends who in the -- in Hoboken and we 're starting to say a lot of our sad goodbyes. But take a look at -- the top photo -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# I love this. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- was a photo -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# Oh, that 's so cool. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- from seven years ago as you can see my little Luke with his shirt pulled up. All of our friends were with us and we decided to recreate the picture with our kids. So we 've got -- @!DYLAN-DREYER# I love it. @!WILLIE-GEIST# That is so cool. @!NATALIE-MORALES# -- we 've got the( unintelligible), we 've got the( unintelligible) @!DYLAN-DREYER# With the shirt pulled up and everything. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. With the shirt pulled up, the Tanlers, all the kids. And even Luke was okay with pulling his shirt up again just to -- the kids actually wanted to do this picture -- @!WILLIE-GEIST# That 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So we recreated that moment. @!DYLAN-DREYER# I love that. @!NATALIE-MORALES# And again, just great friends. And -- and life-long friends no matter where we live, so. @!WILLIE-GEIST# You should keep doing that like -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah.

So elsewhere across the country we are dealing with some chance of storms especially where we 've had the storms lately down through Kentucky, down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight for fireworks in areas like St. Louis and most of Southern Missouri and even into Southern Illinois. But it 's this type of setup it 's just been stuck in place for a while with the humidity streaming in from the south, the rain that comes has the potential to produce about two to three inches of rain in a short period of time. So that 's why we have some flash flood watches in effect. We see the heavier rain moving through Southern Illinois and Southern Indiana and eventually Southern Ohio right now. But it will continue to spread eastward through West Virginia through the day today, even into Washington DC, unsettled all day long with more thunderstorms possible by firework time later on tonight. That 's a look at the weather across the country. Now here 's a peek out your window. @( Weather follows) @!DYLAN-DREYER# And that 's your latest forecast. @!WILLIE-GEIST# All right, Dylan.

Jessica, happy Fourth. Good to see you. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Happy Fourth. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Hi. @!WILLIE-GEIST# All right. Let 's dig right in here. This Friday, my kids are counting down the days to " The Secret Life of Pets. " @!JESSICA-SHAW# I mean I 'm counting down the days. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!JESSICA-SHAW# It 's about a dog named Max, voiced by Louis C.K., who is living his best life in New York with his owner, voiced by Ellie Kemper, when she brings home another dog, voiced by Eric Stonestreet. The voice casts is amazing in addition to those guys. You 've got Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate and Albert Brooks, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He 's also in Finding Dori, of course. @!WILLIE-GEIST# That 's right. @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's a big -- it 's going to be a big hit. All right. Also this Friday, Kenny Chesney, new album coming out. @!JESSICA-SHAW# He does. He has a new album coming out. It 's very personal album. He likes to say that it 's very much a social commentary on how we are all so engaged in social media. We 're not having human contact. He wants people to actually speak, not just text emojis to one another. Tune out the news cycle and things like that. He also might want to encourage his fans to maybe embrace moderation and not drink so much. Twenty-five people are taken to the hospital over the weekend at the Kenny Chesney concert for public intoxication. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Wow. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yeah, that 's a terrible story. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Quite a lot. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Really, yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# We reached out to Kenny for a comment and they have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump ahead to July 13th. Great show, Mr. Robot Returns. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Love this show. Rami Malek and Christian Slater. It 's about a hacktivist, hacker activist. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Yeah. @!JESSICA-SHAW# You know, so you have the lingo. This show when it came at season one was so great. It won the Golden Globe for best drama. Christian Slater won for Best Supporting Actor. Season two Grace Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, is joining the cast as an FBI agent -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, wow. @!JESSICA-SHAW# -- on -- on their trail. @!NATALIE-MORALES# It 's so brilliantly done. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Yeah. @!NATALIE-MORALES# All right. This is one we are all waiting for. July 15th. Get ready, get set, " Ghostbusters " are back and it 's the all-female cast. @!JESSICA-SHAW# It is. There 's been like a little bit of drama here. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Just a little bit. We have a little mentioned here or there. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Yeah. Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghostbusters " this time. There 's been a lot of very disturbing misogyny surrounding this movie, like people so upset like heaven forbid that women -- @!NATALIE-MORALES# That women could take over. @!JESSICA-SHAW# -- do a rebirth of this movie. It does not seem to bother any of the original cast. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, all make cameos in the movie. @!NATALIE-MORALES# Oh, I ca n't wait. @!WILLIE-GEIST# They 're four of the funniest people, men or women, on the planet. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Exactly. @!WILLIE-GEIST# I can not wait to see that movie. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Thank you. Yeah. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Also that day, let 's go to HBO, Vice Principal. We are just saying Danny McBride where he goes, we follow. @!JESSICA-SHAW# Oh, absolutely. @!WILLIE-GEIST# Yes.

If you have a pet, you know this is probably their least favorite day of the year. In a recent survey, forty-four percent of dog owners reported their dog has some aversion to loud noises. And shelters say tomorrow is their busiest day of the year, because so many dogs run away from firework in fear. Also, emergency visits to the vets skyrocketed on the Fourth of July by forty- eight percent. That 's next to pets eating things that they should n't. Well, child care costs are soaring at a pace far greater than most goods and services. According to government data, the cost of raising a child born in 2013 until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and forty-five thousand dollars. That 's nineteen thousand dollars more than the cost of a raising a child born ten years earlier. If Washington, D.C. were to become a state, what do you think it should be called? A commission looking into that says its new name could be New Columbia. That name beat out other suggestions, including The State of Washington, D.C. and Potomac. The group even drafted a constitution. Members of the commission hope the idea of D.C. 's statehood might gain traction at this month 's Democratic National Convention. Well, it may be a bit tougher to see how much money you 're saving when shopping on Amazon. According to The New York Times, Amazon is moving away from posting list prices. Instead, it will use just the current price for items. The move comes after people started questioning the discounts they got online and in stores, with some consumers even filing lawsuits. Finding Dory held onto the top spot at the box office once again, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two million dollars over the first three days long holiday weekend. The Legend of Tarzan was second, The Purge : Election Year was third. Let 's get a check of the weather once again. Dylan is in for Al. Hey, Dyls. @!DYLAN-DREYER# Hey. Good morning, Natalie. Good morning, everyone. Let 's take a look at what we can expect this week as far as precipitation is concerned. It 's been raining for quite a few days now through the Midwest and into the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys. This is moving eastward. And by the time we get to the middle of the week, same kind of zone that 's seen the showers and some scattered thunderstorms. But it 's really by the end of the week in and around the Great Lakes where we do have the chance where some severe storms could develop. So something to keep an eye out for later on this week. Now, as we look at temperatures, it 's below normal in this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been seeing. But watch as the above normal temperatures will start to spread by the middle of the week. Even up across New England, temperatures well above average down through D.C., up into New York City. Temperatures in the mid- nineties. Down south, temperatures will be in the nineties. But your feels like temperature will be well up around a hundred and five to a hundred and ten degrees. And then a little bit cooler in the Pacific Northwest. That 's a look at the weather across the country. Now here 's a peek out your window. @( Weather follows) @!DYLAN-DREYER# And that 's your latest forecast. @!WILLIE-GEIST# All right, Dylan. Thanks a lot. We are celebrating our armed forces on this Fourth of July with a look at one of the military 's biggest events, The Warrior Games. @!NATALIE-MORALES# All branches of the U.S. military joined in a battle for gold. The annual event even inspired Britain 's Prince Harry to create the Invictus Games.
