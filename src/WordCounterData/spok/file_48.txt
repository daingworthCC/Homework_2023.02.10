228241 JUST JACKIE Announcer : From Studio 3B in Rockefeller Center, here is Stone Phillips. @!STONE-PHILLIPS : Good evening. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In her time, she was the most famous woman in the world. Her name synonymous with glamour, courage and mystery. Her face was the focus of a million flashbulbs, but her voice was almost never heard. Despite the constant spotlight, somehow she managed to keep her private life private. Well now, four years after her death from cancer, a new book has intimate details about the life of the woman who fascinated so many people. You may find some of the details surprising. Here 's Sara James. @!SARA-JAMES-reporti : @(Voiceover) Once upon a time, back in the early ' 60s, there lived a fairy princess, and it seemed all was well in her kingdom on the Potomac. @(Jackie-Kennedy) @!Mr-ED-KLEIN : She achieved a life beyond her wildest dreams... @(Voiceover)... with this most powerful man in the world, the adoration of the world. And then a split second, in Dallas... @(Jackie-and-John-Ke) @!Mr-KLEIN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times magazine editor Ed Klein, who knew Jackie Kennedy, has been writing about her for nearly ten years. To research his new book, " Just Jackie " he interviewed 300 people, reviewed some of her private correspondence, and read through FBI files. In " Just Jackie " he tells the story of what happened to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy when happily ever after was over. @(Ed-Klein-typing-at) @!Mr-KLEIN : She could n't go on without a man. When she looked at that dead husband of hers, she realized, for the first time, that she was totally alone in the world. She felt totally bereft. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) With legendary composure, Jackie Kennedy taught a nation too shocked to grieve, how to mourn the passing of a president. Methodically, Klein says, she turned Kennedy the man into Kennedy the myth. She handpicked one of the most famous journalists of the day, Theodore White, and granted him an interview for Life magazine. But according to White 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with politics. @(Jackie-at-John's-f) @!Mr-KLEIN : She said the night before the assassination, they had made love together. And she told him that. She just poured her heart out to White. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) She described the scene in the morgue as she kept vigil over her slain husband 's body. qwq @( Morgue-in-Dallas ; - @!Mr-KLEIN : She did n't know what to do. She wanted to hold onto him in some way. She started kissing his body. She kissed the toes. She covered his body, showered his body in kisses. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Klein says Jackie used White to help create the most enduring myth associated with the Kennedy administration, that of Camelot, the tale of the heroic King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, which was a popular musical of the day. @(Photo-of-Oval-Offi) @!JAMES : She made it sound as if this was Jack Kennedy, up in the middle of the night, putting the record on the turntable. Do you believe that 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have listened to " Camelot. " That was entirely Jackie 's concoction. Jack Kennedy was a " Bill Bailey, Wo n't You Come Home " type of guy. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) But while the public Jackie preserved her husband 's legacy, in private Klein says, her life was in turmoil. It took her 11 days to move out of the White House. Eventually, she moved with her children Caroline and John to a home in the Georgetown area of Washington. qwq @( Jackie ; -photo-of-J @!Mr-KLEIN : Jackie hated it in Georgetown because she turned into a kind of, if you will, living wax museum. I mean, there were these busses that would go back and forth every day. People would take pictures of the house. Hundreds of people would gather outside. She had no privacy. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Klein says Jackie was despondent, dulling her grief with alcohol and large doses of the tranquilizer Amytal. And he writes that Jackie was worried about her children 's mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within a week of the assassination, she started being very concerned about the effect of their fathers ' death on Caroline and John. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) One day, the secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, gave Jackie this portrait of her dead husband as a gift. Hours later, she asked him to take it back. @(Photo-of-Jackie-wi) @!Mr-KLEIN : She said, " Because Caroline and John wandered into the room, took one look at this portrait, and began kissing their father 's face. And it 's just too much, I ca n't bear it. " @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Meanwhile, Jackie turned her attention to planning the president 's grave and enlisted the help of renowned architect, John Carl Warneke. @(Sketches-of-propos) @!Mr-JOHN-CARL-WARNE : I think she thought of it as a very simple grave at that time. @(Voiceover) I do n't think she had any idea of the millions and millions of people that were going to want to come. @(Sketch-of-proposed) @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) The pair spent hours together, and Warneke says a romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship. @(Photo-of-Jackie-wi) @!Mr-WARNEKE : My goal for her was to see if I could bring her back to Earth as a human -- ordinary person who could live a peaceful life, somewhat. Even though I would -- I realized I... @(Voiceover)... would never be able to do that in her case. @(Photo-of-Jackie) @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Warneke had been friends with the president, too, and oddly enough, says he was the one to tell Jackie about her husband 's affairs, to prepare her in the event they were reported in the press. He said she 'd heard the rumors, but did n't know the extent of Kennedy 's infidelities. qwq @( Photo-of-Jackie ; -p @!Mr-WARNEKE : She was shocked. She was shocked. She -- she -- you could tell -- you could tell. She looked up where he was in heaven, I guess, and crossed herself and, you know, she was n't happy at that moment. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Her relationship with Warneke began to attract a little attention, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd become. @(Newspaper-photos-o) @!Mr-WARNEKE : She was in love with me and I was in love with her. So that obviously would lead to marriage. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Warneke says Jackie wanted him to be baptized a Catholic. But Klein contends there was a powerful adversary to the match, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy. qwq @( Photo-of-Warneke ; - @!Mr-KLEIN : He was appalled at the idea that she was going to marry him, because he was divorced, he was n't Catholic, and he did n't think he was an appropriate person for Jackie. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) At the time, Klein says, people questioned whether Bobby Kennedy 's relationship with Jackie, his brother 's widow, went beyond familial obligations. qwq @( Robert ; -Jackie-wit @!Mr-KLEIN : Well, they spent a great deal of time with each other. People saw them arm-in-arm. They assumed because they were arm in arm, that something was going on. But in fact, I do n't believe that Jackie and Bobby ever slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much time with Jackie that his business suffered. While he would rebuild his practice into one of the largest in the world, he says at the time, he needed to concentrate on his architectural projects and the romance fizzled. @(Photo-of-Warneke-a) @!Mr-WARNEKE : I could n't see her so much. I would mean nothing to her if my business failed. @!JAMES : Was she a gold digger? Was she looking for a wealthy husband? @!Mr-KLEIN : Jackie could not step out the front door of her house without hordes of people descending upon her, many of which, yelling at her, " We love you, " or, " You 're responsible for the death of your husband, " or all kinds of things. She could n't live an ordinary life. She needed a man to provide a life for herself that could protect her from that kind of intrusion. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Whatever Jackie needed or wanted, what is certain is that she would soon find comfort in the company of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Aristotle Onassis. qwq @( Jackie ; -Greek-isla @!PHILLIPS : When we come back, the myths and the reality of Jackie 's unpopular second marriage. @!JAMES : There were reports that Jackie had entered into this marriage and demanded money. @!Mr-STELIO-PAPADIMI : That is not true. @(Announcements) Announcer : From our studios in New York, here is Jane Pauley. @!JANE-PAULEY : Returning to our story, we 've seen that Jackie Kennedy 's years as a widow were more difficult than we ever knew. She struggled with her own memories of her husband 's murder and had to cope with life as an icon, a symbol of perpetual mourning. Now she was about to break with the past and take a step that would shock the world. Once again, Sara James. @!Mr-KLEIN : @(Voiceover) She was a woman who loved myth and fantasy, and she saw Onassis as being a kind of modern Greek hero. @(Waves-crashing-aga) @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Aristotle Onassis -- when Jackie Kennedy met him, he was among the world 's richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 million, or almost $ 2 billion today. He was master of his universe. qwq @( Onassis ; -photo-of- @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : The myth was not a myth. The myth was reality. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) For more than 20 years, Stelio Papadimitriou was Onassis 's personal attorney and his president of the Onassis foundation. @(Photo-of-Stelio-Pa) @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : Onassis was a little bit larger -- not a little bit -- substantially larger than life, and he knew it. He was Mr. Greek. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) " The Golden Greek " as he was dubbed, knew how to make money and how to spend it. He had his own Greek island, a 500-acre paradise called Scorpios. But his most-prized possession was a 325-foot floating mansion, " The Christina. " It was as a guest on " The Christina, " in the summer of 1963 that Jackie Kennedy became friends with Aristotle Onassis. qwq @( Onassis ; -Greek-isl @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : He liked generally interesting women. @!JAMES : Famous women. @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : Interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mind fame. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Onassis 's first marriage had ended in divorce, and he was in the throes of a stormy relationship with another famous woman, opera diva, Maria Callas. But when President Kennedy was killed, Aristotle Onassis was quick to rush to Jackie Kennedy 's side. @(Photo-of-Onassis-w) @!Mr-KLEIN : And then, of course, after assassination, Onassis said to himself, ' Hm, you know, Callas is not -- Maria Callas is n't bad, but Jackie 's even better. ' @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Ed Klein says it took three years for Onassis to woo Jackie Kennedy. @(Photo-of-Jackie) @!Mr-KLEIN : People always ask me, ' How could she -- how could she sleep with a man like that -- who looked like that? ' @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Stelio Papadimitriou watched the romance unfold and says Onassis was a man of hidden charms. qwq @( Onassis ; -photo-of- @!JAMES : He was not famous for being handsome or a fashion plate. @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : He was -- he was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth to speak, he would seduce anyone. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) In 1968, Onassis proposed. But Klein says Robert Kennedy, who had disapproved of Jackie 's plans to marry John Carl Warneke, opposed this match, too. Concerned, Klein says, that Onassis ' unsavory business reputation might affect his run for the White House. So Jackie agreed to wait. qwq @( Photo-of-Onassis-w Unidentified Reporter 1 : @(Voiceover) The hearse bearing the body of Senator Robert F. Kennedy has just now arrived. @(Men-carrying-caske) @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) But when Robert met the same fate as his brother, everything changed. qwq @( Jackie-at-Robert 's @!Mr-KLEIN : After the assassination of Bobby, Jackie washed her hands of the United States. She felt that there was no safe place for her and her children in this country, and she had to get out. @!JAMES : Was marrying Aristotle Onassis then a huge security blanket -- ' Take me away from this? ' @!Mr-KLEIN : He could provide for Jackie a real cocoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do you believe she loved him? @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : Yes, but in a rather Anglo-Saxonic way, not the Greek way. @!JAMES : And by this you mean? @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : Not with passion. Not with great passion. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) The couple entered into a prenuptial agreement. Stelio Papadimitriou helped draw up the papers. @(Jackie-with-Onassi) @!JAMES : There were reports that Jackie had entered into this marriage and demanded money. @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : That is not true. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) In fact, Papadimitriou says she settled for $ 2- to $ 3 million in the event of a divorce, a fraction of the Onassis fortune. The couple married in October of 1968, in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in the tiny chapel on Scorpios. qwq @( Photos-of-Onassis- Unidentified Reporter 2 : Monsenior Paulsto Vallainc said today that Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy had knowingly violated church law by marrying Aristotle Onassis. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Klein says back home the reaction to those news reports was horror. @(Cover-of-Time-maga) @!Mr-KLEIN : I think Jackie never realized to what degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who somehow despoiled this virginal dewy queen of Camelot, and in doing so, brought disgrace to the whole memory of John Kennedy. @!JAMES : More than 20 years after Jackie Kennedy Onassis last walked this beach, it still seems she 's expected to arrive at any moment. Stone paths impeccably maintained, trees and hedges carefully manicured and the scent of jasmine and eucalyptus on the breeze. Truly a garden of earthly delights. Klein says Jackie wiled away her time, swimming, reading poetry and painting watercolors. She redecorated the main house on the island, which she nicknamed " the Pink House, " and she undertook an ambitious project : to return Scorpios to it 's natural state. @!Ms-NIKKI-GOULANDRI : That 's how we started the long, long program of replanting. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Botanist Nikki Goulandris helped her find native flowers and shrubs, and the two became lifelong friends. @(Nikki-Goulandris-a) @!Ms-GOULANDRIS : She 's an excellent...( unintelligible). @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) She showed us her personal collection of photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman, and she disputes the stories about Jackie 's compulsive shopping. @(Photos-of-Jackie-a) @!Ms-GOULANDRIS : What they were saying about the thousands of shoes she had. I have known her most of the time, she was barefooted. She was very simple dressed. She bought the clothes from the villages around. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Papadimitriou says when Jackie did spend money it was with her husband 's approval. @(Photo-of-Jackie) @!JAMES : In fact, you believe that he actually encouraged her to go shopping. @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : He liked it. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) And Klein says Onassis was equally generous with her children, although Caroline had reservations about her new stepfather. It was because of the children, Klein says, that Jackie spent increasingly less time with her husband. A devoted mother, she stayed in New York during the school semester. In their first year of marriage, the couple were together for only 225 days, less after that. Papadimitriou says Onassis would complain bitterly about her absence. @(Kennedy-and-childr) @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : ' She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm alone. My only salvation is to talk business. I have nothing else to talk about. ' @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Onassis was soon seen publicly in the company of his old flame Maria Callas. But Nikki Goulandris says Jackie insisted Onassis was faithful. qwq @( Maria-Callas ; -Jack @!Ms-GOULANDRIS : She once told me that, ' I 'm sure that Ari has never had any relationship with any other women since we are married. ' It was her conviction. Unidentified Reporter 3 :( From newscast) The only son of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis died today. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) According to Klein 's book, Jackie 's marriage suffered when her husband 's only son was killed in a plane crash in 1973. His friends say he was devastated. @(Photo-of-an-articl) @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : That was the psychological death of Onassis, the death of his son. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Papadimitriou says a despondent Onassis asked him to draw up divorce papers, but Onassis never went through with the plan, qwq @( Photo-of-Onassis ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to convince Jackie that she should spend more time with him. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) An idle threat but one he says Jackie believed. Meanwhile, Onassis ' health was failing. He suffered from myasthenia gravis, a progressive and fatal nerve disorder. He went to Paris for treatment. qwq @( Photo-of-Jackie ; -p @!Mr-PAPADIMITRIOU : He said, ' My dear, I 'm not a fool. I 'm dying. There is no hope. ' @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Jackie commuted between Paris and New York. Nikki Goulandris joined her there and says Jackie remained devoted to her husband. @(Jackie-getting-out) @!Ms-GOULANDRIS : We went to church together, and she was -- she kneeled and prayed. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) When Onassis died in March of 1975, Jackie was not by his bedside but New York with her children. She flew to Greece for the funeral. Onassis was buried in the little chapel on Scorpios where they 'd married, his beloved son 's crypt nearby. It was her last journey to Greece. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know how much I would love to come back to Greece, but the commotion of the crazy photographers and the sensational newspaper stories they would write would destroy the tranquility one came to find. " Jackie Kennedy Onassis settled permanently in New York. She kept in touch with Goulandris. In a 1979 letter to her, she wrote : " My real life is tranquil and happy, the best thing is that the children have grown up to be strong and loving and unspoiled. " In 1986, she described Caroline 's wedding saying she had never seen two people who seemed to love each other so much. She built a successful career as a book editor, and was escorted around town by reporter Pete Hamil, among others. She became a fixture in New York 's night life. But Ed Klein says she chose to spend the latter years of her life was with another older, accomplished and wealthy man, Belgian diamond dealer Maurice Templeton, who was separated from his wife. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in. We know that he occupied a guest room not her bedroom, and that they were inseparable companions. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Klein says these were happy years for Jackie. But in 1994, at the age of 64, she was diagnosed with cancer, lymphoma. Klein says the cancer spread to her brain. Jackie retreated to her bedroom and prepared to die. qwq @( Jackie ; -photos-of- @!Mr-KLEIN : No men were to be allowed to see her in the bedroom where she died because she did n't want to seen that way even then. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) Klein describes a room lit by candle, with Gregorian chants that filled the air. Outside, on the New York street, a crowd kept vigil. qwq @( Candles ; -crowd-on- @!Mr-KLEIN : She had a scarf over her hair. She was breathing very, very lightly, and friends came in and sat next to her and held her hand and prayed. And she just drifted off and died. @!JAMES : @(Voiceover) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grave site she had helped design 30 years earlier. qwq @( Jackie's-funeral ; - @!PAULEY : Ed Klein says that in the end, despite all the pressures on her, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis managed to live her life her way. You can read more about Jackie in the current issue of People magazine now on the newsstands. Announcer : Still ahead, he stayed at home with the kids while she went to work. So when their marriage broke up, who would get custody? @!LISA-RUDOLPH-repor : By saying, ' They should n't live with him, they should with you, ' are you being unfair? Are you being sexist? Announcer : Is it a case of reverse discrimination? Also, he cut his acting teeth in the early years of television, but he was made for technicolor and the big screen, where he played bigger-than-life characters like gladiators and generals.
