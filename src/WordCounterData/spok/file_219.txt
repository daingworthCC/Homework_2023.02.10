4171241 @!JENNIFER# Well, first, I wanted to say thank you for having me here today, and I 'm so honored to speak on behalf of this population that often goes overlooked. I want to say about MBC that people from all walks of life have this, women my age, women younger than me, men, all get this disease. I 'm a mom of three. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 38 and carrying my youngest child. And I 'm happy to report today that she 's a happy healthy five-year-old. @!JENNIFER# But everybody has different ideas about what somebody is going through living with MBC. We just want to have normal lives. We do n't always look sickly when we 're undergoing treatment, and we just want to live longer. And the way to get there is through funding and research. And that 's what gives somebody like me hope to move forward. Yes, Jennifer, I understand you 've actually created conversation cards to help people talk about cancer. Can you tell me a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with MBC I had a lot of anxiety about how to deal with this new turn of events, and it was difficult for me to know how to speak with my friends and family and for them to know how to approach me. That 's what gave me and my friend Andrea here to create, the idea to create Cancer Conversation Cards. And they 're a set of cards that offer, they 're designed for anybody who has cancer, any type of cancer, any age. And they are designed to give welcoming and friendly approaches to open up this conversation with a loved one. And I just feel we should, need to give more attention to metastatic breast cancer. More attention leads to more conversation, more understanding and ultimately more funding and innovation. Great, and we want everybody to know more about MBC, so throughout the hour we 'll be sharing facts about this cancer on the bottom of the screen. And to help Jennifer and others fight MBC, go to Twitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, for every tweet, Lily, Eli Lily will donate $100 to Living Beyond Breast Cancer, an organization that educates and supports people in the MBC community. So, our goal today is to raise $250,000 during this show. So please start tweeting now because we know we can come to our viewers and say, can we help make a difference in somebody 's life. And we believe you can help us. So get on that Twitter, girls and boys and start tweeting, honey. We got $250,000 to raise today. We 'll be right back. Go on, just try to catch your breath, America, because this will be even more terrifying than our political hot topics. It 's going to be a horror, a horror. Yes, this will be. Very scary. My God. Tuesday it 's the to-die-for Halloween spine-chilling spectacular. We in danger, girl. What will they wear, who will they be and what scary mad fun will JB Smoove and Yvette Nicole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even got your golden ticket with a performance from the Broadway smash " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. " Tuesday, party with us on " The View. " Still ahead, Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush reveal how it felt to see their father talking politics again. Welcome back. As I mentioned before we went to break, we 're on a mission to raise awareness about metastatic breast cancer, and we want to make sure you 're still tweeting to help us do that. Use the hashtag #moreformbc to show your support, and for every tweet, Lily is going to donate $100. Now come on, help us reach that $250,000 goal. If anybody can do it, people who watch " The View " can do it. So, start tweeting. And you know I never tell you to do that. Now, on a completely different note, the floodgates are open against sexual harassment now. There are 300 sexual assault allegations against director James Toback, seven against " Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are denying it. But now Ellen DeGeneres is catching some heat for tweeting this picture for Katy Perry 's birthday, with the message, " It 's time to bring out the big balloons. " Now, people are asking, if a guy did that, would we be okay with it? Okay, well first of all, that 's a play off some of her lyrics in a song, just to, and as you can see from the faces in the picture, they 're all laughing at the joke. So, it 's important not to confuse a moment among people that are comfortable, with power plays and using sexual acts for favors, but I also have a, I do have a bit of double standard on this because Ellen and Portia are gay, and think this is the reason. it 's more important that people that are gay are normalized and you see they 're just like us, and they 're everywhere, because there are a lot of places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend, or you do n't have someone you know, maybe you only see it on your social media feed. And just like it 's important to see healthy body image because we 're feeding our brains constantly, all day long, it 's important for people that do n't have much diversity where they live to see, this is okay, this is normal. I mean, I happen to be close to the issue because my brother is gay, but it 's really important that the good in this picture is more important than anything I see as yes, if a guy was lecherous and said nice, you know, then it would be gross, but this picture to me does more good than bad. Well, but like you said, it 's important to know that all three of them were in it together. Well, they 're dying laughing. All three of them are friends. This is n't, you 're not feeling intimidated or assaulted by my particular actions. So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument if a guy were to do this, everyone would be offended, because if a guy did that, I would feel, I would feel intimidated. I would feel like I do n't want you to do that. It depends who the guy is. If you have a relationship, and it 's funny, and you 're in a group, and you 're laughing, and you 're making a play on some of my lyrics, there 's still a way guy could be... You have lyrics? I do n't sing, but... I do n't know that I, I would n't like it. if a guy did this, we would all be up in arms given the current environment, where we are finally as women coming forward and talking about sexual harassment and sexual assault. I just never think that sexualizing and objectifying a woman is ever funny. That 's just my, my, my view. But I wonder... So you do n't like this, you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it either because I 've had this done to me before where, I mean, I 'm not a skinny girl, and I 've had really big boobs since I was 15. And sometimes people think that, like, it 's a party trick of some kind. And I 've literally had to tell people, like, please do n't take, I remember a really good friend of mine took a picture like that on my birthday, and I was, like, can we not, like, make a face like this when I 'm, like, holding a martini and wearing a low-cut dress. And sexualizing. If you 're okay with it, if Katy Perry is, like, whatever, I 'm a pop star, I 'm okay with this, fine, whatever. But just, like, any time when you 're talking about women 's bodies, especially right now, and I have, it has nothing to do with the fact they 're gay or not gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, I 'm relieved we 're finally having these conversations that so many things that are open secrets in the industry. I mean, Mark Halperin is very well-known political journalist. He wrote " Game Change " about my father 's campaign, which was turned into a HBO movie, I believe he won a Golden Globe Award. These are people who are commanding the narrative of all forms of media. So, I 'm happy we 're finally calling them out and finally, you know, alleged, these alleged accusations. But I 'm glad people, men who maybe behave a certain way should know that we are at a tipping point right now, and you better start behaving like the gentlemen I hope your mother raised you to be. Exactly. And if not, corporate culture needs to get involved. I mean, I was thinking, do men need to be trained to act like decent human beings in the workplace? Is that where we 're at? it should come more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this was posted on social media because typically predatory behavior and assault and everything is when you get someone by themselves, and silence is the ammo. So the idea that this was put out into the ether... I might just be, it 's bad timing. It 's bad timing. It 's bad timing. Poor taste and bad timing. Because we know Ellen, we all know Ellen, and, you know, she 's, what we 're talking about and what she 's doing is two separate things. But people were saying if a guy, if they knew the gentleman, if it was a guy, and this was put out, would we have a different standard? And it seems like we 're split, maybe we would, maybe we 're not, we 're not sure. But the most important thing here is that women have now made it dangerous for men to behave that way. Yeah. It is now, there is a danger of you losing everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes. And finally. Well, yeah because women got together and say, you know what, we do n't, why do we, we do n't have to take this. What the hell? And, you know, and too, and I also want to say, there will be times then there will be mistakes made. Yeah. And so we have to also be very diligent so we 're not sucking up everybody into this. We need to make sure we 're really diligent about this because we really only want to stop anybody who thinks this behavior is okay. This behavior could now cost you everything, everything. Yes, and it should have always been that way. I mean, if you think about it, a federal judge found out, ruled in 1977 that this kind of behavior was illegal. So it 's been 30 years, and we are still talking about it. I mean, Anita Hill, that was a watershed moment, everyone was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are not going to be sexually harassed in the workplace. That was a long time ago, and now it still continues. Remember when you said about, Meghan, that you wished someone had warned you in certain situations, if there had been allegations against someone, and you sat down with them. Yes. In one of these allegations against the director, Toback, when the girl came home and said to the agent, that was really uncomfortable, he said, yeah, I 've heard that story before. Why would you send someone in to a situation you 're aware of the mistreatment? There should be culpability for corporations. But what you 're saying about, like, the picture with social media, I agree it 's really bad timing. I do n't like it, but there 's a big difference between a photo on social media and sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. we 're blanketing it too much into one thing. It is not the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really need to start, you know, at least analyzing it a little bit more. And also, like, not putting yourself in those types of situations, as well. I have a friend of mine that came up to me regarding this director Toback, and she said, he came on to me in a grocery store. She had never met him before. He gave her his business card, and so she called him. You know, he said, I want to make you star. She called him up. That 's a telltale sign right there. No, but in the phone call, in the phone call, he says, I really need to, you know, get to know you on every level, on a sexual level, and she 's, like, okay goodbye. She knew right there. She cut off any sort of contact with him. She was n't going to put herself in that type of situation. Yeah, you know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your integrity, offering and allowing somebody to take your integrity. There 's no upside to that because you will not feel good in five years. You 'll always have that in the back of your head. Sometimes stuff takes, I 've said this before, sometimes it takes a little longer. But I 'm telling you, when it 's you, and you did it yourself, nobody can take that from you. Nobody can point and say, well, you got that because. I 'm just saying. We 'll be right back. So, our mission continues to support everyone living with metastatic breast cancer. Keep on tweeting us, help us raise awareness, use the hashtag #moreformbc to show your support. For every tweet, Lily is going to give us $100, so you know what that means. We got a $250,000 goal. We can do this. We can do this. That 's a lot of money for... It 's a lot of money, but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can support each other, and I know we can hit that $250,000 because I 've seen it happen before. Preach. So, now maybe you 're wondering why I got, why I got all preachy like that. Amen. Well, it 's because the Ten Commandments were set in stone thousands, millions, hundreds of zillions of years ago. But some people were wondering if a little editing is in order, do n't hit me, God, it 's not me, in order for the world we live in now. So, some people think we need to lop a few commandments off. They would like to lose, just saying, do n't worship idols, do n't take the Lord 's name in vain, only 38 percent say that, worship no other God, and keep the Sabbath day holy. Less than one in three say this is important. Is n't, and this was a poll conducted by British Christians. They were Christians. They were Christians that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 94 percent still believe that stealing and killing are important. I want to know about the six percent that think stealing is okay and killing is okay. This is crazy to me. I mean, they 're the Ten Commandments, not the Ten Suggestions. Like, you 're supposed to, I mean, grew up a Catholic girl. You 're supposed to follow the commandments. I mean, they 're not only the basis of our Christianity, Christian faith, but also of the law. Like, when you study law, they talk about the commandments and sort of right and wrong and how you see it in biblical times, as well. So, I do n't know how you lop any of them off. I mean, which one do you get rid of? Ten was already being a little skimpy. Right? I mean, if you only have 10 to live by... You can follow them. But some of these I do n't think I realized were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rusty. I am the Lord, thy God, thou shall have no other gods before me. Like, do n't commit murder. Well, that too. That 's what that, do n't, you know... But using the Lord 's name in vain, my mom used to say that all the time. I 've gotten a little rusty on that. But I did n't realize I was, like it was one of the... Do you? Do you say oh my God? Yeah, just when I 'm excited, my sister gets mad at me. I do n't think that 's what, I do n't think that 's what they mean. they mean GD. G, yeah,( censored by network). Do you think just this is a societal thing that we seem to have, like, gone back so much on what is ethical, what is moral? When I was growing up, I went, I always went to Catholic school. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hell. Like, I, like Catholic guilt is a real thing. That 's what we teach, yes. Like I always was, like, I 'm going straight, like I would always be, like, I 'm going straight to hell because I 'm thinking about the hot guy. It 's Catholic guilt. If you think you 're going to hell, where do you think I 'm going? Well, I mean... We Catholics are very good about that. The Presbyterians did not feel the same way about that, more feel-good. I will say, when I was, the best piece of advice I ever got, and my dad told me this when I was 15, and I live by it, and everyone in my family lives by it. He said, do n't lie, cheat or steal, everything else is fair game. And that 's actually the commandments... Do n't lie, cheat or steal.... that if all us just stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier. Well, then, she might be part of the six percent. The commandments of John McCain. And murder. But you 're doing the right thing because one of the Ten Commandments says thou shall honor thy mother and father. That 's right. That, too. That one 's non-negotiable. So you 're listening to your dad. But there 's things like, I mean, not to get too TMI, but, like, if you 're having sex before marriage, that 's a big one. That 's not, that 's not in the 10, though. That 's not a commandment, that 's( inaudible)... But when you go to Catholic school( inaudible). When you go to Catholic school, that 's a very big no-no. Well, but they, here 's thing about Catholic school, okay, because I also went, I know. Catholic school in the early ' 60s and how it was in the ' 70s was very, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to understand that the Catholic church recognized that there would be shifts in things, you had that ability to make those decisions and say, you know what, I 'm going to go this way. And once we took the idea you had to have 400 children out of the equation, people felt a lot better. But now the most important thing is, you know, if you 're a Christian, if you 're not a Christian, if you 're just a human being, a lot of these are great to live by just as a human being, treating each other well. Well, that 's the thing. A lot of the commandments... Do n't kill people. You know, that 's a good one. It 's like any rule as a parent, you 're just trying to protect your child. And at the end of the day, that 's what a lot of these commandments, and the great thing about the Bible and God is the same yesterday, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though, about taking the Lord 's name in vain. You know, my parents were really strict about what we said in the home. Like, we could n't say oh, my God. We could n't say JC, we could n't say( censored by network). My son, you know, we could say geez. You could geez but not... Sus. Yes, unless you were praising him, and then you could say Jesus. But my son, you know, we used, we implement this in our home. We 're, like, we do n't say oh my God, you can say oh my gosh or oh my goodness, and my three-year-old came up to me, he goes Mommy, I know the F-word. And I was, like, oh God. And he goes, the F-word is oh my God. I was, like, all right, he knows... We 've taught him well. I taught him well. But yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love a kid. I also, these commandments, like you said, they 're universal in all doctrines of major religions, and as long as we try to lead some kind of moral code, no matter what lens you view God and the afterlife is fine. But some people do n't believe in God, and that 's okay, too. But it does n't keep you from being a human being. So there are great... Or leading a moral life. Or leading a good... Even if you do n't believe in God, they 're still valid, commandments, right. You shall not kill, you shall not steal. That 's, that 's what I 'm saying. You should n't kill people, you should n't lie. That kind of goes without saying( inaudible). Listen, nobody at this table should talk about lying ever, ever, ever, ever. But you know what we want to do, we want to just say bye to two amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " and " Benson, " he was 89, he passed away earlier this year. And let me tell you how he wanted to be remembered. He said for all, he wanted to be remembered for always playing true to himself because there 's dignity in truth, but not necessarily truth in dignity. Oh, that 's good. And the other pioneer was Antoine " Fats " Domino, child, passed at 89, amazing musician, fabulous man. We 'll see you soon. At Blueberry Hill right? We 'll be right back. Next, Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush reveal what life is like when your grandfather and father are both presidents, and if they know what dad said that made Obama lose it.
