237941 LOU DOBBS : Good evening. Ames Department Stores today joined the ranks of retailers setting up shop in bankruptcy court. The discount chain today turned rumor into reality, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Deborah Marchini reports on the retailer 's run-in with hard times. DEBORAH MARCHINI : voice-over It has been a swift fall from grace for the nation 's fourth-largest retailer. Less than six months ago, Ames stock was flying near a 52-week high, and Chief Executive, Peter Hollis, was optimistic. PETER HOLLIS, Ames Department Stores, Incorporated : November 26, 1989 We note that even this year where there are a lot of reports about poor economy in the northeast, that our sales and our productivity in the northeast, in the Ames stores, has been terrific @!MARCHINI voice-over ' Terrific ' would hardly describe Ames today ; when the cheapest thing the discount chain now has to offer could well be its stock. It is another case of a retailing buyout gone bust. Roughly two years after Ames doubled in size by gobbling up Zayre, it now seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, debt was n't to blame. Unlike Campeau Corporation, where profitable stores succumbed to high interest payments, Ames simply could n't generate sufficient sales. The company 's strategy of broke by acquisition ran smack into a softening northeastern economy, and the management underestimated the loyalty of Zayre 's customers. They changed the name and the product mix at most of the Zayre 's stores. A critical error may have been doing away with frequent sales and promotion in favor of an everyday low price-strategy, the same sort of strategy that has produced disappointing results at Sears, Roebuck. When sales softened at the newly refurbished Zayre 's store, Ames suffered a cash crunch that made it difficult to pay suppliers. Some cut of shipments, and sales sank further, leading Ames into bankruptcy court. With the Chapter 11 filing, Ames has bought time to try again. Analysts say falling into bankruptcy may be a lot easier than climbing out. EDWARD JOHNSON, Retailing Analyst, Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, Incorporated : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it. I would say it would take a year or more @!MARCHINI voice-over In the interim, Ames will have the financing to pay suppliers. But that wo n't do much good unless it finds a new formula to bring more customers into its stores. Deborah Marchini, CNN Business News, New York @!DOBBS Investors in Ames ' high-yield debt more confident today that they will be repaid. Ames ' junk bonds climbed 4 points in an otherwise flat market. The retailer is the 19th high-yield issuer to default this year. Those defaults totalling more than $ 9 billion, almost matching the level of all of last year. Concerns about financing continue to dog the latest employee buyout bid for UAL. The company 's annual meeting today produced a lot of positive comments about the $ 200-a-share bid, but UAL stock fell anyway. Jan Hopkins reports from Wall Street. JAN HOPKINS : voice-over United Airlines ' employees are still trying to line up financing for their $ 4.4-billion buyout. At the annual shareholders ' meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal. STEPHEN WOLF, Chairman, UAL : Obviously, large leverage transactions in today 's environment are difficult. This one, I believe, is a doable leverage transaction. There are obviously some pieces that need to come together in order to get it concluded, but it is otherwise a doable transaction in my opinion @!HOPKINS voice-over One obstacle the employees need to overcome is the general climate in the airline industry. Higher fuel costs and no big increase in passengers, factors already hurting United 's earnings. The company reporting it lost $ 36.4 million in the first quarter, or $ 1.68 a share, compared to a profit of $ 65.4 million, or $ 3.03 a share last year. Most of that loss was blamed on huge lawsuit settlements. Chairman Wolf is optimistic the rest of the year will show improvement. In addition to earnings, Wolf told shareholders United will soon announce a major order for new wide body planes, but analysts wonder how United employees will be able to get enough financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. STEVEN DEXTER, Airline Analyst, Kemper Financial Services : Certainly, it brings up the danger of having an over-leveraged situation. And when that happens, the healthy competitors jump all over the debt ridden, unhealthy competitors @!HOPKINS voice-over Wall Street is also skeptical United can afford to do it all. United 's stock closing down again, 1/4 point, to $ 152.50 a share, almost $ 50 below the offering price. Jan Hopkins, CNN Business News, New York @!DOBBS The government today offered its approval of Eastern Airlines ' plan to sell its Latin American and South American routes to American Airlines. American agreed to buy those routes for $ 350 million in December. The deal part of Eastern 's reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy. Coming up next on Moneyline, the nation 's candy makers say there is nothing sweet about those government programs to support sugar prices. We 'll have that story for you next on Moneyline.

Manufacturers saying the policies hurt their competitiveness, but lawmakers debating the sugar program are unlikely to make major changes. Cynthia Rodgers reports from Washington. CYNTHIA RODGERS : voice-over Candy makers say government price support programs are pricing them out of the U.S. sugar market. The U.S. price, at 24 cents a pound, is nearly 40 percent higher than the world sugar price. TOM HAMMER, President, Sweetener Users Association : Foreigners can acquire sugar-it sometimes can be half the price of what we 're paying for it. Those products can be presented on the supermarket shelf at prices that are attractive to consumers @!RODGERS voice-over Commercial users have long wanted sugar price supports and import quotas removed, but a sharp runup in sugar prices due to tight supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest in 10 years. E.J. Brach Company, in Chicago, threatening to move factories and jobs overseas if it ca n't get relief from high U.S. prices. The Commerce Department this week denied Brach 's request to pay the lower world price for its sugar. on camera Candy makers say cutting sugar price supports would save consumers over a billion dollars a year. But sugar producers argue consumers would actually be hurt by wildly gyrating prices. voice-over Sugar producers say the current system does work. When supplies are tight, the government approves more sugar imports, as it did this week. A House panel has even moved to sweeten the deal for sugar farmers to keep pace with high subsidies in other countries. JERRY HUCKABY,( D), Louisiana : Let 's maintain a strong, domestic, viable sugar program so we can maintain this multi-billion-dollar industry until such time as the rest of the world is willing to move to a total free trade system @!RODGERS voice-over On Capitol Hill, other bills have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won out in the past, but few are willing to predict the outcome of this battle. Cynthia Rodgers, CNN Business News, Washington @!DOBBS U.S. and Soviet negotiators came close, but did n't clinch, a trade agreement. U.S. trade officials say some details still need to be worked out. That agreement will be, of course, the first step in granting the Soviets most-favored nation trade status. The President and Soviet leader, Gorbachev, are expected to sign a trade deal next month at their summit. Well, Gorbachev is looking for a trade agreement to boost his economy, but those benefits are likely to be long-term. Gorbachev 's short-term problem is how to improve morale and bring consumer goods to the shelves. Doug James has the story from Moscow. DOUG JAMES : voice-over Sverdlovsk. The industrial capital of the Soviet Union, where smokestacks dominate the skyline, and the only work is factory work. These people are among the most productive in the country, yet they have little to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the lowest. on camera President Gorbachev knows he must get the people of Sverdlovsk, and other industrial centers, on his side. Otherwise, his dream of an economic miracle could be doomed. It is not surprising, then, that the Daniel of economic reform has left his Kremlin office and gone directly to the lion 's den. voice-over The lion 's den is the Urlmash sp? Machine Works, one of the biggest factories in the Soviet Union. No sooner had Gorbachev arrived than he was surrounded by a large crowd of workers, their patience stretched thin. But he went on the offensive, reassuring them that price reforms would be implemented gradually, and only after consulting the people. There will be no shock treatment, he said, echoing the advice of his own economic experts, who have now rejected the Polish example, in which austerity measures have been hard and sudden. At a town-hall style meeting inside the plant, Gorbachev launched one of his strongest attacks yet on opposition politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He warned their efforts could backfire. MIKHAIL GORBACHEV : through interpreter We must do everything to avoid confrontation and ultimately a civil war @!JAMES voice-over For the wives of the workers, that means something as basic as finding good, affordable food to put in their husband 's lunch buckets. Gorbachev told them that day would come, but it is likely to be at least another month before his economic advisers put the finishing touches on their reform package ; and with shock treatment ruled out, many months more before the people of Sverdlovsk get the rewards they feel they deserve. Doug James, CNN, Moscow @!DOBBS Well, some congressmen want shock treatment for Japan. Several members of Congress urging the president today to put Japan on the Super 301 hit list. Super 301, part of the U.S. trade law that calls for retaliation against unfair trade practices. Rep. RICHARD GEPHARDT,( D) Majority Leader : Retreating at this precise time would be the wrong step at the wrong time. The reality is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give to our market, Japan and other countries open up @!DOBBS Well, yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative, Carla Hills, took the opposite view of Mr. Gephardt, saying she does n't think Japan belongs on that list. The President is expected to make a decision as soon as tomorrow. Well, the markets in Japan have been under pressure of late. The Nikkei Average overnight closing slightly lower. Todd Benjamin brings us up-to-date from Tokyo. TODD BENJAMIN : voice-over Tokyo stocks back on the south side of the street after closing up Wednesday for the first time in four trading sessions. The Nikkei fell 139 points Thursday, to 29,424. Profit taking and arbitrage-related selling the Nikkei 's undoing. The market 's downside is limited because of a stable yen. But its upside is limited because of concern over trade relations with the United States, according to Masanobu Nishimura. MASANOBU NISHIMURA, Securities Sales and Trading, Manufacturers Hanover Securities Company : Although people think, at the moment, for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expectation in the market that, you know, what 's going to be the next @!BENJAMIN voice-over In the Japanese bond market, the government 's benchmark 10-year bond closing 3 basis points lower to 7.34 percent, a small gain, but enough to break a three-day losing streak. Salomon Brothers is predicting, in the current fiscal year, a $ 35 billion, to $ 70 billion, in net long-term capital outflows from Japan. Less direct investment is just part of the equation. It says private net U.S. bond purchases by the Japanese could be $ 10 to $ 15 billion, compared to $ 25 to $ 30 billion in the previous years. KIM SCHOENHOLTZ, Economic Research, Salomon Brothers Asia : On portfolio investment, that is, investment in securities, we think the slowdown is related to the narrowing of yield differentials between Japanese government bonds, for example, and U.S. government bonds @!BENJAMIN voice-over On the bright side, Schoenholtz does n't see a slowdown in net purchases of U.S. stocks. on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful business group shows 60 percent of those companies polled believes Japan 's economy will slow down in the second half of the year. In December, just 35 percent saw slower times ahead. A big reason for less optimism is a tighter monetary policy by the Bank of Japan. For CNN Business News, I 'm Todd Benjamin in Tokyo.

It was another day of light trading on Wall Street. A strong earnings report from COMPAQ Computers, some bargain hunting and other market leaders gave the market a lift.

There is big money to be made in leverage buyouts still, when they work. Moneyline columnist, Dan Dorfman, is here and has a few views on the subject. DAN DORFMAN, Moneyline Columnist : Lou, I got ta tell you. Henry Kravis today, Lou- DOBBS : There 's a man who knows his leverage buyouts @!DORFMAN Right. You bet. And he must be feeling great today. You know what, he pulled off the public offering of Safeway Stores. It came out at 11-1/4 and went to a premium, although he originally pitched a price of 16. Now, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts owns 67 million shares, which is worth $ 829 million. Kravis paid $ 175 million, so he made a paper profit today-get this-of $ 654 million. He also did well on another front today : Motel 6, the nation 's biggest chain of budget motels : 534 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent, or roughly 27 million units of Motel 6, which is a limited partnership. Now, today those units sizzled. And let 's look at some numbers. And we see the 52-week range 18-3/4-11-3/8 ; the close, that 's up 7.3 percent 14-5/8 ; up 1 ; the volume : That 's over 14 times the average daily volume 1,052.900 ; the estimated value today : We see $ 18 to $ 22. In 2 to 3 years, that 's $ 23 to $ 27. That comes from Montgomery Securities, as based on the projected cash flow from the chain. And the dividend : $ 1.22 a unit, or 8.3 percent. So, why the runup today? What else? As Lou mentioned, takeover rumors, including talk KKR would take it public at 18 bucks a unit. There was also talk of a buyout by Hilton or the Japanese buying an interest. Now, who knows what 's real? Now, in case you 're wondering, a night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Now that 's really back to basics. I do n't know if Henry Kravis would try to sleep there to save a buck, but when you make $ 681 million in a day, Kravis, even with his RJR Nabisco headaches, can surely afford a ritzier place to snooze. Lou @!DOBBS Let 's talk about the P.E. on Safeway. That 's got to be an astronomical figure @!DORFMAN It is, Lou @!DOBBS You happen to know it? DORFMAN : No. As a matter of fact, Lou, at this point in time, I do n't happen to know it, but it is very high @!DOBBS There has been a lot of talk on Wall Street, and I think some of it wishful, looking for Kravis to drop the ball at some point, to come under pressure. This has to mitigate a lot of the pressure that Wall Street had been talking about @!DORFMAN Well, some of it, Lou @!DOBBS A lot of it @!DORFMAN Well, I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think some of it @!DORFMAN Some of it. I mean, you know, who knows what 's going to happen with RJR Nabisco? Some question marks about that. That 's he 's got to- DOBBS : Let 's talk about another favorite in the market right now : UAL. We heard Stephen Wolf talking about ' this is a terrific deal. ' He has mentioned there were one or two little items to lock down. What do you think? DORFMAN : I think, Lou, it is a tough deal. But you know what? I think the UAL deal is going to fly @!DOBBS Well, if you think it is going to fly, what do you think of the market 's reaction, because they are leaving about 30-a little better than 33 percent on the table. Its stock 's trading at just a little over 150. It 's a $ 200 deal @!DORFMAN Fine. Right. But, Lou, you know, the question in the mind of a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a lot of people who have been burned @!DORFMAN A hell of a lot of people have been burned before. So, is the deal going to go through? And you 're talking about something that may last seven to eight months. So, people are not going to pay a premium, or anything close to it now, to buy that stock @!DOBBS You still think it goes? DORFMAN : I think it flies, Lou @!DOBBS Thank you Danny. Coming up next on Moneyline, gas station owners give new meaning to the old saying ' Buy low, sell high. ' We 'll tell you all about that next.

Drivers paying premium prices for regular gasoline. The General Accounting Office reporting some gasoline stations are selling low octane fuel at high octane prices. And it 's costing more than $ 150 million a year. And some in Congress are blaming the federal bureaucracy. Rep. CHARLES SCHUMER,( D), New York : Consumers are confronted with this deception because the Federal Trade Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency, have not carried out their proper enforcement responsibilities, and because there are no federal controls to ensure that gas octane postings are accurate @!DOBBS Well, the difference between the lowest and highest grades of gasoline run about 20 cents a gallon. Oil prices slipped for the third straight day. The U.S. benchmark crude fell 19 cents, settling at $ 18.47 a barrel for the June contract. Oil traders say they are selling ahead of OPEC 's emergency meeting, to be held next week. The cartel saying it is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that before. Undisciplined OPEC production has whipsawed the market of late. Worries about an oil glut sent prices reeling early in April. Prices rebounded when OPEC 's cheaters decided to meet again. There was no agreement to cut production then and prices slipped below $ 17 a barrel. The sell-off set the stage for the cartel 's emergency meeting. Prices soaring $ 2 a barrel when that meeting was announced. Increasing demand for oil products may produce a glut of oil tankers. Overseas ship builders are booked for years with new tanker orders. And that, strangely enough, could help slumping U.S. shipyards. Dan Gifford reports from New York. DAN GIFFORD : voice-over American ship builders may receive a windfall from rising orders for crude oil tankers. JIM WINCHESTER, Shipping Analyst, Mabon, Nugent &amp; Company : The foreign yards are filled, there is long queues, they are getting more and more expensive, and American ship building is at a point where it starts to become competitive @!GIFFORD voice-over That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, only Tenneco and Avondale make solid profits. Avondale could be hurt by defense cutbacks, while Todd is less than a year out of Chapter 11. Most can expect refitting work on older tankers, since they are not competitive now with overseas shipyards. An American-built Exxon Valdez-size tanker would cost three times the $ 85-million building cost overseas. But overseas costs are rising. A Valdez-size ship cost $ 60 million a year ago. Fear of further price jumps could force companies to place ship orders soon, even if that means with domestic builders. Behind the rising costs, pending federal legislation requiring double hull construction, and rising tanker demand and freight rates, factors that have slipped unnoticed past many in the oil markets. MICHAEL ROTHMAN, Energy Analyst, Merrill Lynch : Someone says tanker rates go up and it does n't mean much. Really, what they 've got to take into account is that they 've gone up enough where it has affected the per barrel cost @!GIFFORD voice-over About a dollar more per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mean too many later. More are being built than are being retired, with the resale price of old tankers tripling the past two years. Some see a tanker glut by 1992, when the first new ships are delivered. on camera The tankers being built today are expected to be in the water a little bit beyond their normal 12-year lifespan. The reason is the costs have gone up so much. It now takes about 15 years to recoup the cost of a tanker. Compare that with 1973, when that cost could be recouped in one trip.
