" It went on to sell more than three million copies and now is one of the summer 's most anticipated movies. No car chases, no explosions, no super heroes, except for the incredible African-American women who raised other people 's children almost as their very own. For a lot of people, it 's not just a novel or a movie, but something they lived. Here 's Deborah Roberts. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) In those early, tender and trying moments, the bond forged between child and caregiver can last a lifetime, something Elizabeth Hays knows well. @!ELIZABETH-HAYS-@1R# I ca n't separate her from the course of my life.

It 's where Kathryn Stockett, author of " The Help, " grew up. @!KATHRYN-STOCKETT-@# The real reason why I started writing " The Help " was because of Demetrie, the housekeeper in my grandmother 's home. I have to think that in some ways she saved my life because she used to stand me in front of a mirror. She would just say, " Look at yourself. You 're beautiful. You 're worth something. " @!VIOLA-DAVIS-@1ACTR# You is smart. You is kind. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2#... is smart. You is kind. @!KATHRYN-STOCKETT-@# What an incredible message to give a child. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Long before Kathryn 's work of fiction reached the silver screen, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KATHRYN-STOCKETT-@# I was rejected for three years. I have 60 rejection letters. These, every time I 'd get a rejection letter, it 'll get to a little part where you just felt sorry for yourself. But then, I 'd go back to the story and - try to make it better. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) And all that hard work paid off. The little book that could became a runaway hit, spending more than a hundred weeks on " The New York Times " bestseller list, partly propelled by word of mouth and book clubs everywhere. Now, number one in paperback, it 's still going strong. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) Why do you think this book resonated so with people? @!KATHRYN-STOCKETT-@# I get letters from readers from all over the world that say, " You opened my eyes to something that I did n't even know existed, " or, " Oh, my God.

You know, there 's a lot to be said in a child 's world for steadiness and consistency. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) Yet in Jackson, Mississippi, Elizabeth was growing up amidst a powder keg of racial discontent. @!CIVIL-RIGHTS-ACTIV# We are not @(inaudible). @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Civil Rights leader Medgar Evers had been murdered just four miles from Elizabeth 's home, and public schools were resisting forced integration. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Other parents were n't so open-minded. In fact, one gave Elizabeth a swift and harsh lesson in hate. @!ELIZABETH-HAYS-@1R# There was a kid that had been instructed by his father to spray the black kids with mace. And as a child, I was in the bathroom washing to get the burn out of their eyes. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) And that was your introduction to racial strife. @!ELIZABETH-HAYS-@1R# And an adult could have given that charge to a child. It was disgusting. Hey, Mac @(PH), will you go around... @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) That painful episode was 30 years ago. Today, Elizabeth is raising her own family in North Carolina, guided by the special love she and now her children feel for Alma. But 1200 miles away in Mesa, Arizona, someone else we met has n't been as lucky. For decades, Ivy Johnston has longed to reunite with the woman she ca n't forget. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I 'm thinking about, what does she think about me, how much does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) She 'll soon find out. Today, Ivy 's an emotional wreck, preparing to leave her home for New York City, where, after 20 years, she 'll finally reconnect with Dorothy, the woman she calls her guardian angel. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# Dorothy was my mother 's maid who would come in once a week on Fridays. And she would clean the house. She worked not only for my mother, but for my grandmother and my great-grandmother. Dorothy 's been in my life since I was a baby. And from what I understand, she changed my first diapers. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) She says Dorothy was her anchor, helping her navigate tough times with her parents. Her earliest memories are following Dorothy around the house, literally holding tight to her apron strings. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# We 'd sit at lunch together and just chat about life. And she just taught me a lot of things that a mother would teach a little girl, right from wrong. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) So it 's no surprise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat down and wrote Dorothy a letter. @!DOROTHY-@1FORMER-H# " Dear Dorothy. I am sorry that it took me so long to write you. " @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I just needed to tell you how much I love you and how big a role you played in my life. @!DOROTHY-@1FORMER-H# " I remember being a little girl and... " @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# Following you around the house and listening to you talk. And you were always so cheerful and kind. @!DOROTHY-@1FORMER-H# " It is some things I want to say to you for a long time. " @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# You 'll always be in my heart and prayers as the woman I looked up to, the woman who loved me, the woman who protected me, and the woman who never failed to make me smile. Thank you for all the hugs you gave me. @!DOROTHY-@1FORMER-H# It goes to your heart when somebody say that. And you know you done the best you could by them. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) As for Dorothy, her early life was filled with back-breaking work, first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Carolina, and later, as a teenager cleaning houses in New York. She 's now retired and living in Brooklyn. It was when Ivy posted a comment on " The Help 's " Facebook page sharing what Dorothy had meant to her that " 20/20 " offered to help reunite the two in New York. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I think she 'll say, " Oh, my Lord. " And she 'll cover her mouth, and her big, beautiful brown eyes will open up wide. Oh, I do n't wan na forget the present I bought Dorothy. Which gate are we going to? @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Ivy, accompanied by her mother, is keeping a video diary of her trip. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# What I wan na show you is that the woman next to me on this plane happens to be reading " The Help. " And if it was n't for that book, I would n't be on this flight. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Finally, the morning of the reunion, Ivy 's in excruciating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she 's undeterred, and within hours, in a wheelchair assisted by her mom and headed for Central Park to meet Dorothy. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) So nice to see you. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# Deborah, nice to meet you. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) Hi. I understand you 're not feeling well. Are you okay? @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I am. I 'm in a lot of pain right now, but I would n't miss this for the world. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) How much does she mean to you? I mean - I, I see you tearing up already. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# She means everything to me. She 's, Dorothy is like the mother, my second mother. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) What do you remember most about her? @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I remember her waking me up in the morning by pulling on my toes one by one. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) Now, you saw her when you were growing up once a week, yet, she had such an impact on you. How is that possible? @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# She was always there with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her than anybody I 've ever known. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Voiceover) Earlier that day, Dorothy 's daughter coaxed her from the house, not explaining why she was taking her to New York City Central Park. Now, not 100 feet away, the child she helped raise waits to see her. Do you think she 'll recognize you? @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# I think the wheelchair might throw her off. She probably would recognize me because I have the same stupid haircut I had when I was 6 years old. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) So she has no idea she 's going to see you. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# She has no idea she 's gon na see me. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) I 'm gon na go and find Dorothy. @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# Okay. @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) Hello.

How did you wake me up? @!DOROTHY-@1FORMER-H# I used to take her toes and wiggle them. And she 's like, " Oh, leave my toes alone. " And then, she 'd take her feet and hide it on the cover. I said, " No, hiding today because you getting up and you go to, going to school. " @!DEBORAH-ROBERTS-@1# @(Off-camera) What kind of a child was she? @!IVY-JOHNSTON-@1REA# Oh, God.
