246241 @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SIMON-COWELL : I actually really like that. @!RANDY-JACKSON : And you 're working it out up there on whatever song it is. That was hot too. @!COWELL : If I 'm going to award a place in the finals to the person who has consistently delivered week after week, it 's you. @(END-OF-VIDEO-CLIP) @!GIBSON : The " American Idol " race is neck and neck, all three remaining contestants impressed the judges last night. The pressure is on for Blake, Melinda and Jordan. One will be sent home tonight. Former " Idol " sweetheart Kimberly Locke knows this pressure all too well. She took third place during season two of " American Idol, " recently she 's been filling in as a guest host on " The View " and would like to replace Rosie permanently. On top of it all, Locke has found time to release a second album called, " Based on a True Story, " it is in stores right now. Former " Idol, " finalist and pop music sensation Kimberly Locke joins me in the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think about tonight, who goes tonight? @!LOCKE : I think it 's going to be very interesting tonight. I hope Blake goes but you never know. I think last night the comments that they gave Jordan were kind of mediocre and just kind of ok. They did n't really give her what she deserved, so I think it 's going to be between Jordan and Blake. @!GIBSON : But you would rather see Blake go and it be between Jordan and Melinda? @!LOCKE : Yeah, I think the finale between the girls will be more dynamic than a finale between Blake and a girl. I think the girls sing circles around Blake. @!GIBSON : So why do you think he will remain? @!LOCKE : Because he 's got the young vote. He 's got the young American girl vote. Because he 's a guy, he 's cute, he has this little beat boxing thing going on. And it 's an appeal. He appeals to the audience. @!GIBSON : Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and you 've been watching it this whole time, do you have an explanation for the continued unbelievable success of this show? @!LOCKE : Even when I was on the show, I 'll tell you, I knew the show was going to be huge. I have always thought " American Idol " is the new " Apollo " and it 's the new " Star Search " and I think it will be around for a very long time. @!GIBSON : I have to ask you about this job you want to have. You would like to replace Rosie on " The View. " What do you think you could do with that job? @!LOCKE : You know, I do n't know if I want to replace Rosie, those are big shoes to fill. Do I want to be that opinionated and that outspoken? @!GIBSON : Are you that opinionated? @!LOCKE : I think I am with my friends and my family, could I be that opinionated on TV. I could learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America every single day. @!LOCKE : And that 's why people love her. @!GIBSON : Are you ready to go in there with a box of matches and light it up? @!LOCKE : You know what, I 'll go in with half a box of matches and see what happens. @!GIBSON : All right, so let 's say that Barbara calls you tomorrow, says come on over, we want to talk, one on one, sit two girls in the office, tell me why you want the job, make your pitch. What would you say to her? @!LOCKE : I would say I would add definitely a different dynamic to the panel because I 'm young, I 'm single and everyone else on the panel they 're mothers, they 're a little older. And there needs to be a young African- American voice on the panel I think. @!GIBSON : Do you think America needs to have a stick poked in its eye every day? @!LOCKE : Every day? Maybe every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that, we appreciate you coming on today and we 'll see how your predictions work out tonight on " American Idol. " There of course is your new CD. Coming up, how the proposed Z visa would impact illegal immigration in America. It would have a big effect. I 'm going to explain it. My word is coming up next. @!GIBSON : Time for " your word ", people who write to me at myword@foxnews.com A lot of reaction to yesterday 's my word about Democrats who actually believe Bush knew about 9/11 before hand. Carolyn Greene from Columbus, Mississippi. " I was horrified to hear the numbers you gave about the number of people who believe that President Bush had a hand in 9/11. We do n't need enemies to destroy us, we are doing that from within. What has happened to good old plain common sense in our country? " Kevin L. from Rochester, Indiana, " Bush knowing about 9/11 is not so far- fetched. Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor beforehand. We know Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. 9/11 made a perfect excuse. " You Kevin are part of the problem I 'm sorry to say. Tom in Sarasota, New York, " Unfortunately a large number of Americans do n't know anything about what 's going on in the world. Luckily for everyone else, most of them do n't vote. And this ignorance runs across all political boundaries. It 's this ignorance that keeps you working at FOX instead of Burger King. " I worked at a McDonald 's, as a matter of fact, and as for ignorance at what 's going on in the world, it sounds like we might start with you Tom. On another note, Alan from Miami, Florida seemed to enjoy the GOP debate last night. " Thank you FOX NEWS! The debate was outstanding with substance. Your questions made the candidates distinguish themselves from one another! It impacted my opinion of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now " my word. " A bipartisan panel of senators is working on a solution to the immigration crisis and they have come up with something they call the Z visa. Democrats might get it passed in the House. The president might sign legislation that contains the Z visa. The Z visa will be issued to 12 million or so people in this country. Have you guessed yet what it is? Well, it will grant probationary legal status to illegals in this country if those individuals meet certain conditions, assume the government will not grant Z visas to members of MS13 or other Mexican or Latin American gangs and drug smugglers. And it will only happen if certain triggers are met. First the probationary status granted to illegals. One hopes it would set certain kinds of hurdles for illegals to meet to be granted full legal status and those hurdles should include details like learning English and staying employed and perhaps financial issues like paying a fine for entering the country illegally and paying back taxes. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not kick into action until and unless the Congress and the president achieve certain goals on the border itself. Like better policing and fencing to keep illegals from having what amounts to wide-open access to this country and this economy. People are going to scream bloody murder about granting illegals legal status of any kind, but I think something like this has to be done. Make illegals come forward and meet certain conditions to stay here legally, and make our government enforce our own borders, and then we can move on, please. The problem with all this is it offers hope to illegals whose desire to be here is honest and forthright, that is they want to make a better living, than the mess they endured back home. And the payoff of that hope is out of their hands. It 's up to Congress to fund better policing and fencing of the border and to follow through on promises made to American citizens. So far, Congress has failed those promises, and if they fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say they want to help -- the illegals themselves. How would you like it if your legal status were in the hands of this Congress? That might be scary for anyone. That 's " my word. " Write to me at myword@foxnews.com We 'll see you back here tomorrow, BIG STORY, 5:00 eastern, 2:00 pacific. Now, " SPECIAL REPORT " with Brit Hume. Here is Brit.
