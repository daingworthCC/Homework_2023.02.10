233641 BRYANT @!GUMBEL, co-host : For 21 years, Andy Rooney has alternately delighted, angered, amused and enlightened Americans as a correspondent on " 60 Minutes. " But since, writing is at the core of who he is and what he does, Andy 's out with his 12th book. " Sincerely, Andy Rooney " is a collection of letters. Andy, how you doing? @!ANDY-ROONEY-@1Auth : Great, as far as I know. @!GUMBEL : Yeah? @!ROONEY : I have n't been to the doctor recently. @!GUMBEL : I got you. This -- the -- this book is composed of -- of some of the... @!ROONEY : I have a bad cold, as a matter of fact. @!GUMBEL : Would you -- would you like some echinacea or something? @!ROONEY : I would n't dare take anything for it. You know, all these warnings they give you on the medicine... @!GUMBEL : Yeah. @!ROONEY :... I do n't dare take anything. @!GUMBEL : You just suffer in silence? @!ROONEY : Yeah. @!GUMBEL : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the -- What? -- 7,500 plus letters you 've sent over 40 years. How and why did you come to keep them -- keep copies of them? @!ROONEY : Well, you know, once you get a computer, the computer keeps them. You do n't have a choice. And then I 've had somebody working with me, and she 's very good. And I would write a letter or -- she would keep the letter that evoked my letter and clip them together and put them in a file. @!GUMBEL : Mm-hmm. @!ROONEY : I was surprised that I had as many of them as I had. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. @!ROONEY : I -- I mean, there is something egotistical about saving your own letters, I suppose. Is that what you 're suggesting? @!GUMBEL : I was asking. I was asking. Do you -- do you try to write letters every... @!ROONEY : You 're accusing me, that 's what you 're doing. @!GUMBEL : No, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write letters every day? @!ROONEY : No. I sit down and couple times a week I 'll -- I 'll write 15 or 20 letters. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. @!ROONEY : I do n't write that many letters. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. I -- in the preface of the book, you write that a -- that a person is much less guarded about what he writes in a letter than what he says in public. I agree with you, so we 're not disagreeing. But why do you think that is? @!ROONEY : Well, I think there is a suggestion that a letter is a private thing between two people, that 's why you 're -- you feel freer to express yourself. @!GUMBEL : Even these days when people are so quick to try to take something that was private and make it public? @!ROONEY : Well, it 's still true that -- when you write a letter to one person, you have the idea that you 're whispering, you know? @!GUMBEL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do in a -- in a letter? Edit yourself more? @!ROONEY : Oh, I think so. You have to be careful when you 're on television. I have said some intemperate things ; people expect that of me. But, yes, I am less cautious writing a letter... @!GUMBEL : Yeah. @!ROONEY :... than I would be on television. @!GUMBEL : You say people expect it of you. You -- I -- I saw you quoted as saying you have a -- a bit of a negative streak in you and it has served you well. @!ROONEY : Well, I think -- I think that the world needs so many different things. It needs plumbers, worse than it needs poets, but it need -- needs poets, too. And it needs people who can do things, but it needs critics of the people who do them, too, and I 'm a critic. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. You are -- you are first, last and -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a writer. @!GUMBEL : I... @!ROONEY : I mean, I am -- I -- I just got into this being on television and I hate myself for it. @!GUMBEL : Oh, I -- I think that 's probably strong. But I do suspect it probably gnaws at you that your -- your fame is as a television personality as opposed to as a writer, because writing is what you do. @!ROONEY : Yes. Well said, that is exactly true. I am irritated by the fact that I am better known as Andy Rooney than as a writer. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. Does it bother you when -- when things you write or things you say -- you -- you were -- you were laughing when I said you 've enlightened, angered, amused, etc., etc. -- upset people sometimes as much as they do? @!ROONEY : Well, I am surprised by it. It bothers me that I upset people. I mean, we 're all susceptible to wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that. Yeah, it bothers me when people do n't like what I 've done. @!GUMBEL : Yeah. You -- would it be fair to say you reveal more of yourself in this book than -- than people might gather from having watched you for so long? @!ROONEY : No. How about that for an answer? @!GUMBEL : Why do you say no? @!ROONEY : I think people know who I am. I mean, it 's like -- like the president of the United States, they have all these things written about him over the period of years, and he objects to everything the -- and some of the stories are bad about the president... @!GUMBEL : Mm-hmm. Yes, they are. @!ROONEY :... are -- are wrong, in error. And -- but over a period of years, the American public gets to know the president better than he knows himself because of all the stories about him. And I think people know me thoroughly well by now. @!GUMBEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did from watching, but I was surprised, particularly when I read the chapter on religion in the back end, your letters to your children. I was surprised. You do n't think that 's going to come as a shock to some people? @!ROONEY : Oh, I do think it will. Yes, I do think it will. Were you disappointed? @!GUMBEL : I -- I -- I was neither disappointed or -- or elated. I was surprised to read that you consider yourself an agnostic. @!ROONEY : Yes. Yes, I do. @!GUMBEL : I w -- I was surprised. @!ROONEY : I do n't think the people who like me on television will like me for that, no. @!GUMBEL : Mm-hmm. Anything you still want to do in -- in letters, in literature that you have n't done, Andy? @!ROONEY : Well, I -- I do n't read novels. Because I 'm not interested in taking myself away from the real world. I like the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose it 's possible I would take on a novel sometime. @!GUMBEL : We 're out of here. Andy Rooney, thanks very much. @(Announcements)
