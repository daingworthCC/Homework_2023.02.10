4081941 @!HANNITY : And tonight on our great, " Great American Panel, " he 's a former member of the cast of " Saturday Night Live. " Comedian Joe Piscopo is here. He is a Democratic strategist. He 's worked with New York Senator Chuck Schumer. Chris Hahn is back. And she is the former communications director for the Republican Congressional Committee. Karen Hanretty is back, as well. And first of all, let 's go to -- NBC, CBS, they 're not going to air this -- this ad that we just ran. You 've got this mosque being built at Ground Zero right in the location. We have a controversial imam behind it all. Your reaction? @!JOE-PISCOPO-COMED : You 're getting right into it, are n't you there? @!HANNITY : Yes, sir. @!PISCOPO : I 'll tell you what. The networks have all the right in the world not to air this thing, because that -- what that video that they did was indeed racist. It was race-baiting, and it was derogatory to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Byrd ad in 2000. They ran MoveOn.org 's ad. @!CHRIS-HAHN-DEMOCR : I want to say, the thing that bothered me about the ad and the only thing that really, really gripped me was in the end it said kill the mosque. I mean, can we say stop the mosque? Kill the mosque? @!PISCOPO : But the fact of the matter is that New York is missing the point here, because I talked -- I had the good opportunity to talk to a great friend, a detective in the NYPD. And he told me to this day, like today, people -- cops are dying from the residual toxic effects from World Trade Center. And if they build a mosque there you know what the police told me, the NYPD, just talking outside this building, just now, it 's like a trophy. It 's like a trophy for them. And it 's wrong. But New York, if I may, I 'm sorry... @!HANNITY : So you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to tell you, you do n't go -- we 're always in America, we always go, " We 're going to Iraq. " We always announce what we 're going to do. We 're always going to go, " Let 's kill this mosque. " No. It 's a historical landmark, and that 's what Mr. Bloomberg should rely on. @!HANNITY : But what 's bothering me, they 're making their decision, Karen, without any insight, research... @!KAREN-HANRETTY-RE : Right. @!HANNITY :... understanding of this imam who has made outrageous statements. @!HANRETTY : They do n't care about the research. They do n't care about the insight. This is a decision made purely on political correctness, a political correctness that I think has corrupted this administration 's foreign policy when it comes to we have to, you know, reach out to all the Muslim countries and make them feel good about themselves. And now we 're going to build a... @!HAHN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York, something the city of New York is trying to do? @!HANRETTY : You know what? @!HAHN : The mayor of New York -- listen... @!HANRETTY : It is all part of the same... @!HAHN : I 'm a New Yorker. @!HANRETTY : It is all part of the same attitude of political correctness that is poisoning this country about radical Islam and the refusal just to admit what it is. And Bloomberg does n't want to look -- he does n't want to read and see what this imam has written and what he said and how destructive it is. @!HAHN : I think it 's -- I think it 's -- there 's a lack of sensitivity in putting that mosque in that location. I 'm a New Yorker. I was, you know, in New York on 9/11. This is not, you know, something that, you know, goes with what that -- that site stands for. But that said, people do have a right to pray in this country, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have a right to pray. But the idea that you even look at it in terms of " I do n't think it 's very sensitive. " Has nothing to do with sensitivity. It is flat-out wrong. And people like Bloomberg should absolutely be chastised for not admitting how evil radical Islam is in this country and what they 're doing around the world. @!HANNITY : I think Karen has nailed this. Yes. @!PISCOPO : You 're absolutely right when you say who 's building this, and what is his background? @!HANRETTY : And just -- we do n't want to be insensitive. @!HANNITY : What do you think of the idea we ban burqas in the United States? What do you think? For example, there 's a debate this New York about whether or not Muslim holidays would be put on the school calendar. Does America now have to -- it is wrong to assume that people will assimilate? And is it bigotry to say, " Well, we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Is it -- are women sometimes, maybe not under Sharia law but within their own families, forced to wear burqas? Is that a repression of women? @!PISCOPO : I do n't know. I do n't know what France is talking about, man. I mean, if they want to wear it and express something, religious views, I could n't figure out what they -- they banned... @!HANNITY : Well, hang on. If you live in Saudi Arabia and you do n't wear a burqa, you 're in trouble. @!PISCOPO : I know. @!HANNITY : If you 're in Saudi Arabia, you 're with a guy that you 're not related to, you 're in trouble. The morality police are there to stop you. You ca n't drive a car in Saudi Arabia under Sharia law. So you know, and then this controversial imam wants America to be more Sharia compliant. @!HAHN : You know, listen, I do n't think anyone wants to see women work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think we want to see women forced to do it. But there are women -- if there are women who are -- who want to do it, if they choose to do it, that 's their religious belief, then that 's... @!HANNITY : What about -- what about -- what about our license and you - - can you cover your face when you get a picture for your license? @!HANRETTY : No. @!HAHN : Absolutely not. @!HANRETTY : Of course not. You know really... @!HANNITY : That came up in Orlando. @!HANRETTY : You know what makes me nervous about banning the burqa, though? Is I always think it 's the same thing that makes me nervous about forms of censorship. If they 're going to... @!HANNITY : We 've got to... @!HANRETTY : You can censor the bad guys. @!HAHN : The slippery slope. @!HANRETTY : I 'm always afraid that eventually, they 're going to try to censor the Christians. @!HAHN : Yes. @!PISCOPO : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a new reality show. @!HAHN : The Burqa. @!HANNITY : We 've got to take a break. @!HANNITY : When we come back, more with our great, great, " Great American Panel. " @!HANRETTY : How about, " Pleased to Meet the Burqa "( ph)? @!HAHN : I guess( ph). @!HANNITY : As we continue with our great, " Great American Panel. " All right. Are you ever going to run for office in New Jersey? @!PISCOPO : I do n't know. Thinking about it. @!HANNITY : A colleague of Chuck Schumer's. @!PISCOPO : Well, yes. @!HAHN : You 're lucky. You 'd be very lucky. @!HANNITY : He 's telling me, trying to convince me in the break how conservative Chuck is, if only I 'd get to know him and sit down and break bread him. @!HAHN : You should. @!PISCOPO : Jersey is the best place in the universe, and I 'd love to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a good governor that knows how to balance a budget. @!PISCOPO : I saw you with Governor McConnell SIC last night. Everybody 's -- and now Governor McConnell SIC has a surplus in Virginia. But... @!HANNITY : That 's right. @!PISCOPO :... Mr. Hannity. @!HANNITY : Wait. Wait. @!PISCOPO : But they 're cutting education. That 's not right. @!HANNITY : Excuse me. Wait a minute. He did something that you never see in government. He went from spending -- he went from... @!PISCOPO : What was the first thing he said? What was the first thing he said? Sean, what was the first thing he said when he sat down with you last night? He said -- he said, " Well, unfortunately, we had to do some cuts we did n't want to do. " @!HANNITY : So what? Piscopo... @!PISCOPO : You 're cutting your heart( ph) in teachers and firefighters at least. That 's the only argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have no problem with it. And I 'll tell you what. In California... @!PISCOPO : Because you 're not a teacher, Karen. @!HANRETTY : Yes. That 's right, I 'm not a teacher. @!HANNITY : She 's not a member of the teachers union. @!HANRETTY : The teachers union, which is( UNINTELLIGIBLE) education in America. @!HAHN : Everybody wants cuts until it 's their -- everybody wants cuts until it 's their program that 's cut. @!HANNITY : I say this. Why does n't America do exactly what they 're doing in Virginia? Why do n't we go back to 2006 and say, " That 's our limit. That 's all we 're spending? " @!HANRETTY : In California, they 're half of... @!HAHN : How much stimulus money did it take to balance the budget? The stimulus money that every conservative in this country was against. A lot of it. So let 's not -- let 's not give him all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect him to not take the money. @!HAHN : No, I expect -- that 's what it 's there for. @!HANNITY : And then the citizens of his state have to pay the money. He 's just getting some back. @!PISCOPO : When are we going to draw on the resources of the United States of America? When are we going to create jobs? This is what everybody 's waiting for, jobs. And this administration... @!HANNITY : When we get a new president. You want to know when? @!PISCOPO : But also from the governors, from Virginia and the New Jersey -- create jobs. Create manufacturing. @!HANRETTY : You know what? @!HANNITY : We 're not going to get jobs until we cut taxes and bureaucracy and regulation -- Karen. @!HANRETTY : Let 's talk about manufacturing. You know, manufacturing unemployment, if you just look at the manufacturing industry, unemployment in that industry is hovering around 30 percent. And you are not going to see manufacturing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability. You 've got to cut back on these regulations. I do n't know what on earth is taking this president so long to pass a couple of free trade agreements. Even if you -- even if a bank was going to lend you money and you were going to build something, who are you going to sell it to? @!HANNITY : I brought this up with Lou Dobbs earlier tonight. So the president goes to Holland, Michigan, today. He goes to this company. They get $151 million to create 300 jobs. They 're building car -- electric car batteries. @!HANRETTY : Electric car batteries. I love this story. @!HANNITY : So 151, 300 jobs ; $500,000 a job, Piscopo! @!HAHN : It 's a brand-new industry that needs -- needs some seed money. We need better batteries for electric cars in this country. So we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. @!HANNITY : The difference between you and me is I believe -- did Henry Ford need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government when he started Ford. There was a lot -- there was a lot less competition when Henry Ford was around. @!HANNITY : Stop spending our money. These guys spend money like it 's water. Unless you are Colonel Nadler( ph) and getting in a cab. @!HANRETTY : And they do n't spend it -- they do n't spend it to create real jobs. @!HANNITY : Exactly. @!HANRETTY : When you first said the stimulus budget went to transportation, I thought everywhere we heard Obama is doing one precedent( ph) after another. We 're going to have all these shovel-ready transportation jobs. Where are they? @!HAHN : This economy -- when the president took office this economy was bleeding 700,000 jobs a month. @!HANNITY : Stop. @!HAHN : The last two months, we 've added 83,000 private sector jobs. @!HANNITY : Eight three thousand? @!HAHN : It 's a start. You 've got to start somewhere. @!HANNITY : Excuse me. @!HANNITY : This president lost four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent a fortune and robbed our kids and grandkids blind. @!HANRETTY : And he 's not created jobs. @!HANNITY : Piscopo, save -- save the panel tonight. @!PISCOPO : I 'm just enjoying this, this anarchy here on the set. And I love your pearls, Karen. I think they 're great. @!HANNITY : Are you hitting on her? What 's that? @!PISCOPO : She 's a Republican. @!HANNITY : This is not " Saturday Night Live. " What do you think this is? @!PISCOPO : Thank you very much. I just think in New Jersey it 's great that none of you have to, if you 're a police officer... @!HANNITY : Do you like Christie? @!HANRETTY : I love him. @!PISCOPO : As a person or as... @!HANNITY : I did n't ask you as a person. @!PISCOPO : He 's a good guy. @!HANNITY : Do you like his policies? @!PISCOPO : You 've got -- what kills me about what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the resources of the state and of the people. @!HANNITY : I have an idea. If any of us run into economic trouble, what are we going to do? Pull our belt tight. How about the government goes back to 2006 spending levels and stays there? What would be so bad about that? Live within our means. @!PISCOPO : How about getting jobs for the Americans? Why ca n't... @!HANNITY : Why do you think the jobs have to come from the government? Why do n't you believe in capitalism, freedom, liberty, free market? @!HAHN : When the market fails, somebody 's got to step in. @!HANNITY : The market has not failed, for crying out loud! We do n't let it work. @!PISCOPO : You would think he 's Italian. @!HAHN : I know. @!HANRETTY : Tell you what. If you took New Jersey -- if you took New Jersey 's state regulations to the level of Virginia, I 'll bet you 'd have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have right now. @!PISCOPO : And now in New Jersey if you 're a police officer you have to learn the language of whoever you 're pulling over. @!HAHN : And that should create some jobs. We 're all happy. @!PISCOPO : I do n't think you should have to learn the language. I think you should learn dialect. I think you should just learn the dialect of the person you 're pulling over. @!HANNITY : And what 's the New Jersey dialect? @!PISCOPO : No, I mean... @!HAHN : You should n't make fun of the New Jersey dialect. My mother made fun of New Jersey dialect once. Once. @!HANNITY : All right. I like everybody but Piscopo on the panel. That is all the... @!HANNITY : I 'm kidding. That 's all the time we have left. As always, thank you for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues. Greta is standing by to go " On the Record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you back here tomorrow night. Greta, take it away. '
