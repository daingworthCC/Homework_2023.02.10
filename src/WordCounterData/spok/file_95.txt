235641 NOAH ADAMS, Host : You 're inside the blue and gold tent, trying to find your seat. The clowns are running around, playing tricks. It 's as if this show has always been going on, and you 've just walked in. sound of applause and laughter The Cirque de Soleil - it began about ten years ago in Quebec, came to the U.S. for the first time in 1987. Has played California, New York City, Washington, Chicago, Boston, London, Paris, and Tokyo. This latest production is called ' Saltabanco ' sp - the Italian word means ' street performer, ' and a Cirque de Soleil production is an evening of theater, with fantastical themes, swirling lights and costumes that are often startling. But there 's plenty of circus here as well. We talked this week with Warren Conley sp, the acrobat coach, and with Neomi Tamillo sp, one of the young acrobats. Neomi is featured in a Chinese poles performance, and the Russian swing. WARREN CONLEY, Acrobat Coach, Cirque de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets it- ADAMS : Gets really going high and then at the apex of the swing- NEOMI TAMILLO, Cirque de Soleil Performer : You go up- ADAMS : You go up and you go way up in the air- Ms. TAMILLO : Yeah @!ADAMS Yeah. Ms. TAMILLO : And you land on the mat or on people 's shoulders or on a piece of stick. Mr. CONLEY : The Russian bar. Ms. TAMILLO : The Russian bar @!ADAMS The Russian bar. When it goes wrong for you, what happens? Ms. TAMILLO : When it goes wrong? ADAMS : Yes. Ms. TAMILLO : If I leave too early from the swing, then I go way and back and have spotters that catch me if I fall off the bar. If I fall over the mat, then that 's dangerous @!ADAMS Umm. Have you done that? Ms. TAMILLO : Yes @!ADAMS Been hurt? Ms. TAMILLO : Yes @!ADAMS What kind of- Ms. TAMILLO : I had whiplash in my neck when I was in Montreal, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think @!ADAMS We 're talking about danger, but I have the feeling that people do n't come to your circus to see dangerous things tried. I mean, they 're looking for things that say to them, ' How in the world could somebody do that? ' Ms. TAMILLO : But sometimes the most dangerous tricks are not that impressive anyway to the public. Sometimes the easiest tricks- sometimes are even more impressive. Mr. CONLEY : It 's not really the trick, it 's the performance of the trick, or it 's the presentation of the act as a whole. A Chinese poles act, done by the Chinese, I could fall asleep watching it. Even though it 's got some incredible tricks in it, I could fall asleep, because their presentation is n't there. A Russian swing act, in the same sense, can be really boring to watch. Ms. TAMILLO : Truly traditional- Mr. CONLEY : If it 's done in a traditional sense. That 's the guys that run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air and go, ' Hey! ' You know, this is the type of thing that is- ADAMS : Drum roll- Mr. CONLEY : Yeah, the drum roll stuff, and it's- to us, it 's really important, it 's the whole combination of things. You have to be an acrobat to perform in our circus, but you also have to be a dancer and you also have to be an actor, and this year, you also have to be a singer. You have to be such a well-rounded performer that so that we can achieve that presentation, the quality that there is @!ADAMS Neomi, what is your story? Did you see the Cirque de Soleil before you even thought about it? Ms. TAMILLO : Yes, I saw it in ' 88 in Quebec City. They had a show, unintelligible. I went over there with one of my friends to see the show, and I found it really interesting, because I was doing gymnastics for ten years, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop gymnastics, stop competing, I wanted to continue in acrobatics, and I auditioned for a couple of small circuses in Montreal, small troupes that go around. And I did that for a while. Then I saw the circus were auditioning for a new show, so I decided to try the audition out @!ADAMS Do you recall the night you saw them, the circus for the first time? Did you say, ' Boy, I really want to be up there? ' Ms. TAMILLO : Yeah, that 's exactly what I said. This is what I want to do @!ADAMS Was there one particular act, do you remember? Ms. TAMILLO : Yeah, it was the plunge- Mr. CONLEY : Teeter sp board. Ms. TAMILLO : It was the teeter board act- ADAMS : Where somebody is thrown up from one side? Ms. TAMILLO : Yeah, somebody pushes, and they bounce up, and they land on the mat, or shoulders @!ADAMS Or on the shoulders, you land on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ' That 's me. ' Ms. TAMILLO : That 's me, going up in the air @!ADAMS Going to run away and join the circus. Ms. TAMILLO : Yeah @!ADAMS How- you 're talking about presence and a certain theatricality - how do you decide? First of all, do you get more people who want to be in Cirque de Soleil than you can accommodate? Is there big competition? Mr. CONLEY : There 's a lot of people, I mean, the name of the circus is getting bigger and there 's a lot of people that see it as a high-level performance art, or whatever. The competition is certainly beginning to grow. At the same time, like I mentioned about the quality of performer that is in the show, the competition, the amount of people that want to get into it is high. The amount of people that we can actually find that are at that level is not quite so high @!ADAMS Neomi, is there an age cut-off? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're doing, or can older people do this? Ms. TAMILLO : There is not an age limit at all. I know people that are 50 and still walking on the wire and some people in our troupe are like 34 now and still boarding and jumping up 30 feet in the air. It depends where your body is at or the pain it can still take, I guess @!ADAMS Yeah. Ms. TAMILLO : Because like right now I 'm going to be doing an act with a girl - we 're just starting. I 'm 21 and she 's 14, and we 're going to go as long as we can, wherever we can take the act to @!ADAMS What sort of act? Ms. TAMILLO : It 's like in the flying trapeze act, where you have somebody hanging by their knees and catching the flyer, except there 's no trapeze at the other end - it 's just a unintelligible, and I 'm hanging by my knees upside down, and we hold hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to develop something like that? Ms. TAMILLO : A good three years, I think, maybe a little more @!ADAMS Really? Three years? Ms. TAMILLO : Yes @!ADAMS Neomi Tamillo and Warren Conley. She 's an acrobat ; he 's her coach. They 're with Cirque de Soleil. The circus has a final performance here in Washington on Sunday, moves on to Atlanta, and then Cirque de Soleil opens an entirely new presentation in Las Vegas on Christmas Day @!WERTHEIMER This is NPR, National Public Radio.
