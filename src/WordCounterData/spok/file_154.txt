254241 Announcer : This is an NBC News special report. Here is Matt Lauer. @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos : Good morning, everyone. I 'm Matt Lauer. We have breaking news out of Pakistan this morning. An opposition party official says that former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has died. She was apparently killed in a suicide bomb blast that killed at least 20 other people. NBC 's Jim Maceda is in London following the developments. Jim, good morning to you, and what 's the latest? @!JIM-MACEDA-reporti : Hi there, Matt. Well, the latest is that hospital sources now are confirming that Benazir Bhutto has died from apparently a very severe neck injury. This took place this morning as she was leaving a rally that she had given in downtown Rawalpindi, the garrison town near Islamabad. Thousands of people had turned up at the Liaquat Bagh park there to see her and hear her. We are really in the first week of a major campaigning towards parliamentary elections, which are to take place on January 8th. Her vehicle was leaving that park area when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was safe, but that soon changed to a report coming from her husband that she was in critical condition. And now the report that, in fact, she has died from those wounds. Matt : @!LAUER : All right, Jim, thank you very much. I 'm joined in New York here by Ann Curry. And it was just on October 22nd, Ann, that you interviewed the former prime minister in Pakistan, and she had just survived a similar attack upon her return to Pakistan on October 18th. @!ANN-CURRY-co-host : That 's right. A massive suicide bombing attacked her entourage as it was landing -- as it had just arrived at the airport. And I interviewed her a few days after that, and she -- I asked her, Why do you continue to risk your life? Why, when you had a comfortable life in London? You 've got your children, your husband, you 're safe. Why do you want to come back to Pakistan and expose yourself to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love Pakistan, and I am the greatest hope for this country to return to democracy. She is, of course, a controversial figure. Her government, as a former prime minister, was accused of corruption. But she said that without her there was no chance for Pakistan to return to democracy. @!LAUER : Very controversial also in her return. There was a huge opposition to the current administration in Pakistan. How large a following did she have? @!CURRY : An enormous following by people in the lower classes, people who had nothing. She really was, from our experience, being there on the ground and from her own -- the way she described herself, the people 's choice. A kind of a ground swell of people really supported her. She, however, was vilified by extremists. She actually had accused the Musharraf -- President Musharraf 's government of having members of his own government who were working in conjunction with some of the extremists in the northern region, in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I think, even more of a target by making those kinds of statements. @!LAUER : When you talked to her after that suicide attack on -- in October, upon her return to Pakistan, I mean, she was on top of a bus or a truck at that time, and the suicide bomber got fairly close. What steps were taken, what did she talk about in terms of increasing -- and the people around her -- increasing security? I know you had to go through extraordinary security just to be able to talk to Benazir Bhutto. So what did they do to try to prevent a future attack? @!CURRY : Well, you 're absolutely right. Getting to her was going after one after another. I counted at least four bag searches and at least two scanners, a couple of body searches just to get to do an interview with her. She put the responsibility for her security on the backs of the President Musharraf government. So now the question has to be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secure? Were enough steps taken? There 's going to have to now be, no question about it, an investigation into whether the president 's government did enough to secure her. He, of course, for his part, says there 's only so much you can do to secure a woman this controversial. @!LAUER : Right. And speaking of President Musharraf, obviously the United States has been supporting him, hoping that he can be an ally in the war in terror. Jim Maceda, I want to bring you back in from London right now. So what do we expect the administration 's response to be to this attack and the death of Benazir Bhutto? @!MACEDA : It 's going to be very negative, Matt. No question about it. This is a person who not only represented a moderate voice in a very volatile political atmosphere here as we go towards these elections, but she was supported by the United States for the reasons you mentioned. She was somebody that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business with, who could become prime minister after these January 8th elections and serve as a counterweight, a counterbalance to Musharraf, who clearly does not brook any dissent within his own regime, even if he has taken off his military uniform. So this is going to come as a devastating blow, no doubt, to US goals and attempts to bring stability to the country of Pakistan. @!LAUER : Well, Jim, let 's stay on the subject of these upcoming elections then. Does the death of Benazir Bhutto shatter her base, or does it galvanize her base? @!MACEDA : I think it could in many ways shatter the base. There 's nobody -- I mean, she is a larger-than-life figure. She was in exile for so many years. She had just come back, and she would raise hundreds of thousands of people in the streets. She 's the only political figure in the country who could do that, and Musharraf knew that. What is likely to happen -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of these events -- that Musharraf now has every reason to come out politically or publicly today and say that emergency rule is back in force. And then anything can happen after that. Back to you. @!LAUER : All right, let 's just recap for people who may just be joining us, Jim and Ann. We got news early this morning that Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan, has been killed in a suicide bomb attack. It happened in the town of Rawalpindi, and apparently, at first there were conflicting reports as to whether she had survived the attack. And then her husband made a statement saying she had been critically injured. And now we have confirmation from a hospital in that area that Benazir Bhutto has, in fact, died. We 've been talking to Ann Curry, as well, who interviewed Benazir Bhutto back on October 22nd, and talked specifically about the dangers she faced in returning to her country. And I remember, Ann, from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in danger, but you 're also putting everyone around you in harm 's way. @!CURRY : And she felt that responsibility very strongly. I will -- also I 'd like to add, Matt, that she -- her relationship with President Musharraf was strained before she arrived. They had developed a kind of connection. They sort of had a kind of working relationship that would allow her to land back in on the soil of Pakistan and to launch her bid to run for election. But during the martial law that he ordered in, I believe, in late October, early November, during that time the relationship became very, very strained. So that 's an interesting point to note. I think that Jim Maceda is right to bring up the possibility that would be reinstated. @!LAUER : And as you 're saying this, we 're looking at the very first pictures that we 're getting out of Rawalpindi after that suicide attack early this morning United States time, resulting in the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now live on the phone. She, of course, is NBC 's chief foreign affairs correspondent. Andrea, Pakistan is so vital to US interests in that area and in the war on terrorism. We need that country to be stable and strong in that war on terrorism. What does this do to that dynamic? @!ANDREA-MITCHELL-re : Well, this, of course, is a tremendous blow to the American strategy. The American strategy was initially to support Bhutto. She came here to Washington. I met with her. She was meeting with people on the Hill and in the administration. And then saw her repeatedly as she was working very hard to get Washington 's support. She went back with Washington 's support. Their hope was to broaden Musharraf 's regime to include Bhutto and other elements of the opposition. And, of course, that began to fall apart, as Ann knows well from having been there. They then had to back off and defer to Musharraf, who, of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Qaeda, against the Taliban. But throughout this period, they were well aware that Musharraf was, according to many critics, playing both sides. And this has become a major issue, Matt, in the presidential campaign, whether the US put too much stake in Musharraf and then tried to back off with this support, this latest support for Bhutto and other elements of the opposition, but too little, too late. It was long after Musharraf had declared martial law, had packed the supreme court, firing the initial supreme court and made it impossible to really mount an opposition against him. And as people will inevitably talk about this, Musharraf, as Bhutto herself said, was ultimately responsible for her security or lack of security. @!LAUER : And so, Andrea, so how does the United States reaction to and position on Musharraf change from this day forward? @!MITCHELL : They have no alternative but to stick with Musharraf because, at this point, the situation is way too volatile for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musharraf is the only one who, at least initially, controls the military. They have made inroads with other military leaders who were expected to succeed him if anything happened to him. So there are deep relationships among other members of the military. But the real unknown here is the power of the ISI, the Pakistan Intelligence and Security Operation, which has long had close ties with the Taliban and has been playing both sides of the street. @!LAUER : And, Andrea, is it -- I mean, do we know of -- is there anyone who could step in and fill the vacuum now left behind by Benazir Bhutto? @!MITCHELL : Well, of course, there is Nawaz Sharif, the other former prime minister and returned exile -- has been in exile in Saudi Arabia for almost a decade. So there are other elements of the opposition. This will clearly make it very, very difficult for Musharraf to survive, but my bet would be that the US would hope that the next general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musharraf when he took off the uniform, would be the person who can restore order or at least hold this country together. @!LAUER : All right, Andrea Mitchell joining us on the phone this morning. Andrea, thank you very much. @!MITCHELL : You bet. @!LAUER : And, Ann, thank you as well. We 're going to have much more on this breaking news, the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, killed now in a suicide bombing in that country today. We 'll be back, but first these messages. And we are back on TODAY on this Thursday morning, 27th day of December 2007. Coming back with this news that Benazir Bhutto has just been killed in Pakistan. Obviously, breaking news and something that clearly destabilizes that country, and the United States has to hope not that entire region because Pakistan is a key ally and key player in the war on terrorism. And, Ann, it 's -- I just have to say that, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just talked to her about this very threat, this very danger that she faced on a daily basis. @!CURRY : I arrived specifically because, when she arrived, when she came back to Pakistan to run for office again, she was attacked at that time by a suicide bombing, and there were many people who were hurt. @!LAUER : All right, we 're going to have much more on this. But first, we 're back on TODAY in just a moment. This is TODAY on NBC. '
