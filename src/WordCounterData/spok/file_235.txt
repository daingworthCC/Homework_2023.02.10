4172941 @!JUDD-APATOW# It 's great to be here. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Good morning. @!MATT-LAUER# Crashing meaning crashing emotionally or physically crashing on someone 's couches? @!JUDD-APATOW# Well, it 's about a comedian whose wife cheats on him. And then he goes to New York to try to be a successful comedian, but he 's not good at it. Yeah, so he sleeps on different people 's couches like Sarah Silverman and T.J. Miller and people like that. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# It 's funny. I watched it last night and I was thinking, okay, how do you make the fact that a standup comedian is horrible, how do you make that funny? @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# But you did it. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# It 's hilarious. @!JUDD-APATOW# We decided Pete do his real jokes for the extras in the audience. And then I make him do it like five times. And by the fifth time, they hate him and then they start not laughing and it feels like -- @!CARSON-DALY# Who 's not in this? I mean, you got all the greats there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay, finally. How do you keep things juggling at the same time? @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!MATT-LAUER# You got movies working. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!MATT-LAUER# You 've got Girls entering the final season. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!MATT-LAUER# You got this show starting. Are you one of those guys who needs to have a lot of things working at once? @!JUDD-APATOW# I do like to do a lot of things at once. It 's really fun. But it 's also you 're creating teams of people and I 'm just overseeing. So some shows, I 'm very busy on. And some I just pretend to do stuff on. @!MATT-LAUER# You guys think that -- did you -- did Girls do what you thought it was going to do? Did it -- did the result of what we 've seen from Girls after all these seasons match your expectations? @!JUDD-APATOW# Oh, absolutely, because HBO let us go as long as we wanted to go. They supported us. And hopefully the legacy of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you know, it 's a female showrunner who is the writer, director, producer, star, it influences a lot of people to become leaders of shows. It influenced a lot of women. I know my kids are really influenced by being around Lena. @!MATT-LAUER# It opened a lot of doors. The reason you 're here also is because you 're going to host the next hour. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Yes. @!CARSON-DALY# Oh. @!JUDD-APATOW# Oh, what 's going to happen then? @!CARSON-DALY# I 'm going to watch. @!MATT-LAUER# Have you done that for us here? @!JUDD-APATOW# I 've done it a little bit. @!MATT-LAUER# Yeah? @!JUDD-APATOW# Apparently, it went well enough to give me a shot to do it. @!CARSON-DALY# Yes. @!JUDD-APATOW# But things can go terribly awry. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well, stick around. @!JUDD-APATOW# things might go wrong. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# We shall see. @!CARSON-DALY# Speaking of Crashing. @!MATT-LAUER# Crashing, by the way, premieres February 19th on HBO.

We 're going to play a game with this perfect title. It 's called Brooke, Judd or Both? @!JUDD-APATOW# Oh. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Okay.

Here we go. @!JUDD-APATOW# What if we do n't know? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well, you 'll know if it 's not you. @!JUDD-APATOW# Well, I have a little dementia. I 'm not sure. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Okay. That makes it more entertaining. @!JUDD-APATOW# Okay. All right. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# All right. Here 's the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Who graduated from Princeton University? @!JUDD-APATOW# I 'm lying. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Did you? @!JUDD-APATOW# I did not. I did not graduate. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Did you graduate from Princeton? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I did graduate from Princeton. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# You 're such a genius. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Oh, yeah. @!JUDD-APATOW# I quit USC because I won the dating game. And the trip was during finals so I chose Acapulco -- Acapulco and left. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Judd, are you serious? @!JUDD-APATOW# I wish I was n't serious but I actually did. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Did you win the dating game? @!JUDD-APATOW# I won the dating game and they -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You won the dating -- @!JUDD-APATOW# -- they said this is the week you have to go and I -- so I said, all right, I have to drop out of school. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# No way. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# How was the date? @!JUDD-APATOW# I did not get lucky. I did not. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You had to go with the person? @!JUDD-APATOW# I went with her. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came around -- you know, you come around and then -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Oh, so you did like the real thing. @!JUDD-APATOW# I did the real thing. I came around and she went like ah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# So you charmed her. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Oh, no. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# No. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well, look how great she turned out, so ha. All right. Who was once named Entertainment Weekly 's Smartest Person in Hollywood speaking of which? @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah, yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Is that you? Let 's give him a round of applause. @!JUDD-APATOW# Two thousand seven. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# So there you go. @!JUDD-APATOW# I was so smart ten years ago then it all fell apart. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Even though you did n't go to graduate. @!JUDD-APATOW# See? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That had to feel like an honor, right? @!JUDD-APATOW# It was an honor because I beat Will Smith. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Yeah, well. @!JUDD-APATOW# I can say I beat everybody, I mean, everyone in show business. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I loved it. @!JUDD-APATOW# I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Did you get greater respect around your peers like just walking around? @!JUDD-APATOW# I really did n't get that much respect just because Entertainment Weekly is n't like that respected. I mean, it was n't like The New York Times said it, you know. It 's Entertainment Weekly. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Listen, no magazine has ever said it for us so. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah, exactly. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# All right. So here 's another one. Who has two daughters and is married to a funny person? @!JUDD-APATOW# I wonder. -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I 'm going to say -- @!JUDD-APATOW# -- both of us. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Oh, that 's fair. Look at that. @!JUDD-APATOW# Right. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Who are you married to, Brooke? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I 'm married to Chris Henchy. And you 're married to -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Brilliant writer, producer Chris Henchy. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Yes. @!JUDD-APATOW# And my wife is the great Leslie Mann. I always Leslie. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Instead of Leslie. @!JUDD-APATOW# And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Leslie. It 's Leslie. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# How long have you been married? @!JUDD-APATOW# Just twenty years in June. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Okay. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# No. @!JUDD-APATOW# But I got to get the pronunciation right. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You 've got to do that right. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# So, wait -- so for how many years did you say -- you said Leslie? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Leslie. @!JUDD-APATOW# I said Leslie, the Long Island way. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Like with a Z. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. I only did that for nineteen years. I said why did n't you tell me earlier? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Did you say it right in the vows? @!JUDD-APATOW# I do n't think I did. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Like I take you -- @!JUDD-APATOW# I take you, Leslie. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Leslie. @!JUDD-APATOW# But she said I did n't want to correct you because I thought you would n't be able to -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# In front of everybody. @!JUDD-APATOW# No. She thought I would n't be able to adjust it. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That is hilarious. @!JUDD-APATOW# And so -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finally said, hey, honey, can I tell you, my name is actually Leslie? @!JUDD-APATOW# That 's a good question. I 'm not sure. But I said I -- If I have to change the pronunciation of your name, then you have to call me Judd Apatow. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Oh, I like that. It sounds so fancy -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Exactly. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# -- and smart, like you are. All right, here 's the next one. @!JUDD-APATOW# Okay. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Who wrote the line, " Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it does n't last twenty-two minutes, it lasts forever. " @!JUDD-APATOW# I 'm saying Brooke because I might get in trouble the way you pulled it out. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Really? Did I read it wrong? @!JUDD-APATOW# I mean Valentine 's Day is tomorrow. That does n't help me out at all. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Was that you? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I 'll say it lasts forever. @!JUDD-APATOW# I do n't believe that at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# And you 've been married for what? @!JUDD-APATOW# Twenty years in June. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Twenty years.

And we 're going to -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Maybe you 're going to be over there. @!JUDD-APATOW# I 'm going to be there so I might just drop by. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You will. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I feel like you guys are so busy. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Totally. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Look at the list of projects. you guys always have things in the works. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# it 's important to keep -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You mean, you 're the one -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# -- that always has so, so much. I mean I ca n't handle not being busy. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I understand that. @!JUDD-APATOW# What happens if you 're not busy? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I panic. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I panic and I get really dark. I get depressed. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah, yeah. I understand that.

That 's good. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I love that. @!JUDD-APATOW# And more right about things than Seth Rogen. Clearly, Seth is not the one who knows.

Did Beyonce win? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Kind of. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Sort of. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Kind of sort of. @!JUDD-APATOWA# She won but just by being Beyonce. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well, there 's that. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Just by being Beyonce. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# She 's a walking piece of art. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# But, I mean, the baby is like the best addition to anything. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Like if you 've got the baby, it 's the best accessory. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I agree. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I mean, it was an incredible -- I mean, I felt bad because her daughter was not paying attention when she stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# But that whole opening and that song with that body, I just loved it. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That was amazing. @!JUDD-APATOW# That 's a bold move to bring your child on stage. How old is -- is -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# She did n't bring her on stage. She was sitting -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Oh, in the audience. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# She is right in the audience. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# And she had a little like Mickey Mouse purse and she was playing with the Mickey Mouse purse and she was going I love my children and my -- you know. She was so beautiful and poised. And that -- how do you two from that, the whole number that she did was extraordinary. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I do n't even know. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# And that baby belly -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I have twins. And I feel like I walked around in yoga pants and Maxie dresses. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# But there 's the celebration of it which is so -- everybody was worried about her in the chair. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pregnant person should not do a lean back in the chair move. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I mean -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# It was on like a pulley -- I mean, not a pulley but it was on this like a lever system so I was n't as worried but -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# But whoever was in charge of that system, I mean, that 's one of those things where -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Can you imagine? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# No. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# My hand will be shaking. @!JUDD-APATOW# I do n't think a pregnant person should even wear a headdress that pointy. It 's all dangerous. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# It 's art. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# She took home about five Grammys. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Exactly. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I mean, you can wear whatever you want if you 've got -- if you 're taking home five awards. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Exactly.

She opened the show performing Hello. And then this is being talked about today. She had a tribute to George Michael. She stopped mid-performance for a redo. Let 's listen and then we 'll chat. @!ADELE-( CBS/The-Rec# I know it 's live TV. I 'm sorry. I ca n't do it like last year. I 'm sorry for swearing. And I 'm sorry for starting again. Can we please start it again? I 'm sorry. I ca n't mess this up for him. I 'm sorry. I can't. @!JUDD-APATOW# That 's Adele. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# you 're right. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yes. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# But it 's also -- she 's human. She owned it. She knew that she would be angry with herself after. And, you know, I mean it 's the kind of thing -- I did that when I was -- had to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I messed up. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Wait. So you stopped? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I stopped but I had to stop three times. And I wanted to die. @!JUDD-APATOW# Let 's go to the footage of that. Do we have that? We do n't? We do n't? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Well, my husband was amazing. I texted him. I said I 've just ruined my entire career. And he said do you have to go up on stage and I said, yes. He said curse. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Cursed. And so I got up on stage and I cursed and then they forgot totally about the messed up. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Well, there you go. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# She made it human for everybody. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# she -- and she did it out of respect for George. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# I agree.

I mean, what do you think about this carpool karaoke? It 's turning into such a thing. @!JUDD-APATOW# I got to ask that you -- they 're doing some version of it for Apple. They asked me to do it. I said that is the biggest mistake you 've ever made is asking me. But I said no. No one wants that at all. Judgment is off. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# And then the rap one, the rap-off, too. Have you seen that? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Oh, that 's right. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Anne Hathaway did that. And they all -- and it was -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Hard to top. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# he 's -- you know, people trust him. And I do n't think that he wants them to look bad so. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That 's true. That 's true. All right.

I do n't know. I feel weird about that. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Judd, would you do this @!JUDD-APATOW# Would I do that? @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Yeah. @!JUDD-APATOW# I 'm sure I 'd it, you know, with my kids. I am always eating their food and they 're furious. So I 'm always, you know, like -- or if they look away, I grab something. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Really? @!JUDD-APATOW# It 's a big fight in our house. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# What about you? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# With my kids, you know, there 's always like the ten-second rule or whatever. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Yes. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I mean I 'd pick something up off of the ground and stick it back in their mouth like they 're fine. They 're antibodies. @!JUDD-APATOW# Oh, sure. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# They 're good. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germs. I mean -- @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# -- the -- the germs of a preschooler will have you out for five, six days. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Get me little petri dishes. @!JUDD-APATOW# you 're supposed to expose yourself to germs. That 's -- you do n't get sick if you expose yourself like you wipe your hand on a dirty surface like here like if I like licked it, I wo n't get sick. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Right. @!JUDD-APATOW# It 's magic. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# But then the four-year-old and then I have a flu. Anyway. All right. So big fashion news over the weekend. We have to squeeze this in. Brooke 's iconic 1980 ad for Calvin Klein has been resurrected -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# No pun intended. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# -- in the label of -- @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Squeezing it in. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# -- their new jeans. When you see this what do you think? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# You know, it 's nostalgia. I could n't believe when they called and asked me. We 've been working on it for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the label. And when I was at the fashion show nobody really knew that I was just there to sort of support Raf, the new designer. And then they all -- the jeans walked by and my label is there. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# So on the back waist of the jeans? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I 'm on -- I 'm on on everybody 's butt. @!JUDD-APATOW# Yeah. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# How cool is that? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Take it. Yeah. It 's pretty cool. Look at that thing, it 's kind of funny. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# How about that? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Oh, it made me laugh. It was -- I 'm really proud of it because it 's -- it 's a good nod. It 's nostalgic. But it 's not -- it 's not- - it 's done in the right light, @!JUDD-APATOW# I do n't think I could have done that kind of ad at that age. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# No. I could n't even do it now. @!JUDD-APATOW# I did n't have -- I did n't look that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!JUDD-APATOW# I did n't do that. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# You can always try the pose if you want to. Al, there you go. You can have that patch -- wait -- women 's jeans or women and men? @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# It 's all. Yep. Women, men. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# Anybody, you can -- there you go. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# Yep. Women, men. I 'll get you a pair, Al. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# On -- on your butt. Just wherever you go. @!BROOKE-SHIELDS# I 'm going to be on your butt, Al, all the time. AL ROKER : They actually -- they -- they actually have a picture of me on a pair of overalls. So it 's really -- @!SHEINELLE-JONES# There you go. @!JUDD-APATOW# I 'm wearing Al Roker jeans right now. AL ROKER : That 's right. On Cathcart jeans, Cathcart overalls. There is me. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# How is the weather? AL ROKER : Anyway -- well, you know, we 're here in White House -- Washington Courthouse, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by golly, we 've still got some blizzard-like conditions in parts of Maine. And we 've even got lake-effect snow from Erie into -- into parts of Watertown, New York. And even at Eastern New York, we 're seeing some snow. But the big snows, as this low pressure pulls away, it strengthens potential blizzard conditions along the coast. Not just for the snow but the blowing and drifting snow. And when those winds, we 're going to be looking -- you can see, we 're talking about upwards of twelve inches of snow in parts of Down East Maine. But winds stretching from the spine of the Appalachians all the way into New England. Warnings of fifty to sixty miles per hour. In the warning areas advisories, forty to fifty mile per hour winds. Quite frankly, I 'm a little nervous about trying to get back into New York today because the wind gusts are going to be so strong. So, Judd, maybe you 're filling in again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country. Here 's what 's happening in your neck of the woods. @( Weather follows) AL ROKER : I 'm missing two of my favorite people Judd Apatow and Brooke Shields. My gosh -- and, of course, Sheinelle but I mean Sheinelle is there. @!SHEINELLE-JONES# That 's fine. Well, I 'll -- I 'll keep them here until you get back. Thank you, Al. All right.
