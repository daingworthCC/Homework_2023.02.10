4072941 SEAN @!HANNITY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR : All right, from its refusal to call this a war on terrorism to its vocabulary of man caused disasters and overseas contingency operations, this administration has shown a consistent inability to face up to our enemies and in this regard it has been a very tough week, a badder( ph) week for Attorney General Eric Holder. It appears that Mr. Holder well, is at a loss when it comes to what may have inspired the recent terrorist attacks against the U.S. Now, take a look at this exchange that he had with Texas Congressman Lamar Smith during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!REP-LAMAR-SMITH-@1 : Do you feel that these individuals might have been incited to take the actions that they did because of radical Islam? @!ERIC-HOLDER-ATTOR : Because of? @!SMITH : Radical Islam? @!HOLDER : There are a variety of reasons why I think people have taken these actions. @!SMITH : But radical Islam could have been one of the reasons? @!HOLDER : There are a variety of reasons that -- @!SMITH : But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a variety of reasons why people do these things some are potentially religious -- @!SMITH : Yes but all I 'm asking is if you think among those variety of reasons, radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did? @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : All right, now that performance was followed shortly by the Attorney General 's embarrassing admission regarding his stance on the Arizona immigration law. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SMITH : Have you read the Arizona law? @!HOLDER : I have not had a chance to. I 've glanced at it ; I have not read it. @!SMITH : It 's 10 pages, it 's a lot shorter than the health care bill which was 2,000 pages long. I 'll give you my copy of it if you would like to have a copy. It 's hard for me to understand how you would have concerns about something being unconstitutional if you have n't even read the law. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : All right, so given this performance. Does Holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking law enforcement official? And joining me now as reaction to all of that is the former governor of the great state of Arkansas, the host of his own show right here on this channel, Mike Huckabee. Governor good to see you, thanks for being here. @!MIKE-HUCKABEE-FOX : Great to see you. @!HANNITY : You know, the funny thing is, is before he admitted he was n't briefed on the law, did n't read the law, the Arizona immigration law. He was on " Meet the Press " saying we 're concerned this is -- this law is about racial profiling, we may file a suit about this. And then this admission -- he never -- and by the way its 17 pages if you print it out. @!HUCKABEE : Yes. @!HANNITY : He admits he never read it. @!HUCKABEE : Well, it 's -- I 'll tell you what has happened this week, Eric Holder has made Robert Gibbs look good which I was not sure was possible. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HUCKABEE : Because he 's taken two hits from Congressmen from Texas, I call it Texas two, the Obama administration zero. It was a bad week in admitting -- @!HANNITY : Correct. @!HUCKABEE : -- that he had never read the law. @!HANNITY : Here is the problem, though, because the president himself, you know, he has a law background. He 's supposed to be the smartest guy in -- @!HUCKABEE : A law professor. @!HANNITY : A law professor -- all right, he never read the law. He 's -- look, either he did n't read it and he 's ignorant and did n't interpreting it properly or he 's purposely politicizing it when he said, well, you might go in an ice cream shop -- @!HUCKABEE : Yes. @!HANNITY : -- and then we ask him where your papers are. I 've read the law, four specific times -- @!HUCKABEE : Yes. @!HANNITY : -- it says specifically you can not racially profile. @!HUCKABEE : I too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get in trouble in an ice cream parlor if you tried to steal the ice cream -- @!HANNITY : Yes. @!HUCKABEE : -- before the officer came in. But other than that -- @!HANNITY : He ca n't -- @!HUCKABEE : -- that 's not an issue. The unfortunate thing is that this law is becoming this lightning rod for a debate that ought to have been solved by Congress taking care of securing the borders in the first place. What I do n't understand is the one Constitutional responsibility of the President and the federal government have is to secure borders. They are not responsible for making you buy health insurance, picking CEOs, owning car companies, bailing out insurance companies and banks. They are responsible for taking care of the border. But what they are supposed to do they do n't what they 're not supposed to do, they are doing. @!HANNITY : Yes, but I -- the sinister side of this, it 's having an impact. The board of the LA city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes. @!HANNITY : D.C. is now trying to follow suit. This girls basketball team in Illinois -- @!HUCKABEE : A terrible situation, yes. @!HANNITY : -- they won their first conference championship in 26 years they ca n't -- they were selling cookies and having bake sales, they ca n't go. The all-star game may be pulled from Arizona now. So -- so the misrepresentation, purposeful misrepresentation is having an impact. @!HUCKABEE : Well, that 's not fair to Arizona. I do think Arizona is probably going to up spending a lot of money defending itself in court. That 's probably going to happen. You can rest assured the ACLU is hoping as soon as this law goes into effect in July that they can find somebody who can claim that they were harassed by the police that this law was violated, where someone asked them first before a quote, " legal contact ". It could have a chilling effect on people coming forward and telling police officers what they saw in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of the exchange - it 's almost like who 's on first? Who -- you know -- @!HUCKABEE : Yes. @!HANNITY : -- what 's on second and I do n't know who 's on third base. Listening to Eric Holder, thread this needle his unwillingness to admit that there were radical or could be radical Islamic terrorist connections to the attempted Times Square bombing. @!HUCKABEE : Sean, it 's inexplicable why this administration has a hard time understanding that the real enemy America faces is Jihadism carried out by radical Islam. That does n't mean that we castigate every Muslim in the world as being radical and being a Jihadist. But you can not look at what has happened even in places like Little Rock where this guy goes by and shoots two young soldiers out of recruiting station. What happened with the Times Square car bomber? What has happened with the attempted underwear bomber? Every bit of this is Islamic Jihadism. @!HANNITY : But -- and in every single case there 's this rush by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no terrorist connection. This is a lone wolf. And every time they turn out to be wrong. @!HUCKABEE : This is the polar opposite of what used to be where we had a conspiracy theory every time there was an assassination whether it was John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy and we said there was a conspiracy it turned out they can only pin it on the lone assassin. In this case they are rushing to try to say it was a lone assassin but it 's part of a greater network -- @!HANNITY : Right. @!HUCKABEE : -- of pure evil and we just have to call it what it is. @!HANNITY : Here 's the big question, because of their unwillingness to do so and, you know, their lack of willingness to address that there is a real war with a real enemy that we have really identified, radical Islamists, does that -- here 's the question, does that weaken, does that create a susceptibility, a vulnerability for the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!HUCKABEE : Well, I think we 're more likely to be not only attacked or more likely for -- to be unable to defend ourselves or to preempt it because we 're so politically correct, we 're so afraid and that 's why you have 80-year-old ladies with blue hair and a walker getting the shake down at an airport. And somebody can come right behind them, but we do n't want to do anything even though it might be an 18 to 30-year-old - - @!HANNITY : Nobody gets wanted more than me. @!HUCKABEE : No, I do. @!HANNITY : Nobody gets want -- I have a bull's-eye wand Hannity it says on my back. @!HUCKABEE : Well, then the two of us should never go to an airport together because we 'll shut the whole thing down. @!HANNITY : All right, pretty frightening time. @!HUCKABEE : It is. @!HANNITY : Governor, we 'll be watching this weekend. @!HUCKABEE : All right, thanks. @!HANNITY : Thanks for being with us. And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!DAVID-HOROWITZ-FR : For or against it? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : For it. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : Chilling video of the clash between conservative David Horowitz and a Muslim college student. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SARAH-PALIN-FORME : That 's enough federal government, that 's enough of your overreach and we 're going to do something about it. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : Governor Sarah Palin makes a bold prediction about the 2010 midterms. All of that, plus the teacher who brutally beat one of her students speaks out. @!HANNITY-continues, # @!HANNITY : Governor Sarah Palin was in Washington today and on the subject of the midterm elections she predicts one group of voters will have a major impact this November. Take a look. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PALIN : I think a whole lot of moms who are concerned about government handing our kids the bill generational theft too are stealing opportunities from the future of America we rise up and moms say come on that 's enough, that is enough and we 're going to do something about this. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : All right, look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!HANNITY : And tonight in " Your America " : it is the chilling video from a college campus right here in America. An unusual exchange between conservative David Horowitz and a Muslim student at the University of California San Diego and it was all caught on tape. Now, in a minute we 'll get reaction from David Horowitz himself. But first, take a look at this. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HOROWITZ : Will you condemn Hamas here and now? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I 'm sorry, what? @!HOROWITZ : Will you condemn Hamas? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Would I condemn Hamas? @!HOROWITZ : As a terrorist -- genocide -- @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Are you asking me to put myself on a cross? If I say something I 'm sure that I will be arrested. For reasons of homeland security, so if you could please just answer my questions? @!HOROWITZ : If you condemn Hamas -- Homeland Security will arrest you? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : If I support Hamas. Because your question forces me to condemn Hamas, if I support Hamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't condemn Hamas obviously, you support it, case closed. I 'm a Jew. The head of Hezbollah has said that he hopes that we will gather in Israel so he does n't have to hunt us down globally. For it or against it? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : For it. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : Wow. And here with more on the stunning video are the editor of FrontPagemagazine.com, David Horowitz and Mark Levine, the author of " Heavy Metal Islam " and a professor of history at the University of California in Irvine. David, that 's -- that 's chilling especially in light of the fact that -- this is a no-brainer. You know, when she was out there saying I 'll be hung from a cross if I -- Homeland Security will be after me. She is acknowledging in that statement she knows Hamas is a terrorist organization. @!HOROWITZ : Right. @!HANNITY : And she would n't condemn it so she is saying she supports it, checkmate. @!HOROWITZ : It 's - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as victims. The really chilling aspect of this is that it 's going on now at -- all across the country. The Muslim Students Association is an arm of the Muslim brotherhood. I was at you UC San Diego because they are holding an apartheid, Israel Apartheid week which is a genocidal hate week. It was funded by $40,000 in student funds. Its centerpiece is an apartheid wall which is a lie itself of Hitlerian( ph) proportions because the Israel security fence has nothing to do with ethnicity. There are a million, a million Muslim Arabs, Palestinians, living in Israel with more rights than the Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank or Jordan or Arabs anywhere in the Arab world. That security fence is because of a genocidal campaign, rockets, suicide attacks on Israeli civilians and that was the only way to stop them. @!HANNITY : Mark -- @!HOROWITZ : In the university there are 23 universities now attacking Israel ; that the war presents Jews, as murderers of innocence, occupiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- @!HANNITY : Look -- @!HOROWITZ : -- this woman was honest enough to admit it. @!HANNITY : Well, she was. And this is what 's amazing. And this student group, correct me if I 'm wrong, David and I want to go to Mark here. It got $40,775 from the university for that semester. Is that number correct? @!HOROWITZ : That 's exactly right. And they are getting it -- @!HANNITY : Right. @!HOROWITZ : -- at all the other universities as well. @!HANNITY : All right, Mark, your -- you 're reaction. Here 's Hamas, part of its charter is the destruction of the State of Israel. Here 's a student given an opportunity to condemn Hamas, a terror group, she would n't do it. Your reaction? @!MARK-LEVINE-UC-IR : Well, first of all, thanks for having me back on. I think before I give the reaction I really would like Mr. Horowitz to answer the young woman 's question at the beginning about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote, unquote, " arm of the Muslim brotherhood ". I mean, I have n't seen evidence to that. I do n't even know what that means. And these kinds of accusations when someone asks you a question instead of answering it you go on the attack about another question and then keep provoking and take a woman who obviously was n't thinking very cogently or coherently and get her to say all this nonsense which clearly is hate building, condemnable, I mean, no one is going to argue with that. But there still is a point that accusations are constantly being made that are not given any support. And I think you know, this is part of the same problem. I see him, I see Mr. Horowitz as being the opposite side of the coin with her. Just what he said just now when he 's saying all the things that using the apartheid law, or all of these means, your anti-Israel, when there are many Israelis -- Israeli Jews who use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law and against international law and it 's so hateful. So to make these kind of accusations you know, it 's really like throwing -- @!HANNITY : I give David a chance to talk. @!LEVINE : -- stones when you have a glass house. @!HOROWITZ : Ok, this is both disingenuous and dishonest because Mark Levine is a supporter of these hate leagues and a supporter of the Muslim Student Association. @!LEVINE : Ok, no, no, you can not say and without proving it. I do not support it. Prove that I support them. You 're lying. I 'm calling you a liar on international television. Prove it. Either prove it or take that back, right now. @!HANNITY : Wait a minute, let David respond. @!LEVINE : But he 's lying. @!HOROWITZ : Mark Levine, well you -- @!LEVINE : No, show me the proof. @!HOROWITZ : It 's hard to talk when somebody is interrupting you all the time. You are at UC Irvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst campus in terms of intimidating, harassing Jewish students. You are -- you step in as an apologist for these -- @!LEVINE : Prove it. @!HANNITY : Mark, let him finish. @!LEVINE : Ok sorry. @!HOROWITZ : Well, you know, yes, anybody watching -- anybody watching this show can go up on the Internet and find you and find what you say. @!LEVINE : That 's not proof. @!HOROWITZ : My question to the woman -- my question to the woman about Hamas was an answer to her question. The Muslim Brotherhood created Hamas. And the Muslim Students Association is part of the Muslim Brotherhood Network. And we know this -- @!LEVINE : Said who? @!HOROWITZ : -- because -- @!HANNITY : He 's answering let him answer. @!HOROWITZ : -- we know this because during the Holy Land Foundation trial, the Holy Land Foundation was an alleged charity which was funding Hamas. And the FBI produced a raid of their offices and among the documents they found was a plan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ". And among the organizations named by the Muslim Brotherhood as part of their organizational plan was the Muslim Students Association care the Muslim American Society which is another supporter of these events. @!HANNITY : We 're running out of time -- @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : Let me -- hang on one second, David hang on one second. @!HOROWITZ : Yes. @!HANNITY : Because we are running out of time and I want to get to the bottom of this. @!HOROWITZ : Absolutely. @!HANNITY : You did not answer Mark, yet my question and I go back to it. I want you -- do you condemn Hamas as a terrorist organization? @!LEVINE : Absolutely. And I 'm on record on every book I 've ever written in saying that. @!HANNITY : And Hezbollah, so the student that is part of this that is getting student funds. You heard her answer. @!HOROWITZ : Right. @!HANNITY : And so the question is, why would -- why would the student and this organization get any student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and condemn a terrorist organization? @!LEVINE : Well, you know if you 're going to start making these kinds of litmus tests for getting student funds you could also look at right wing groups -- @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : And I -- stop. @!LEVINE : Listen, listen let me finish, we have the -- @!HANNITY : Should this student group get any student funds? @!LEVINE : As long as every other student group has the right to get funds regardless of their political views then this group has to. @!HANNITY : So. @!LEVINE : You want to make a change against that then you have to make it to everyone like the Ayn Rand Society whose president has a debate with me, said he supported the genocide of the American Indians. Should they be getting student funds? I mean, this is free speech this is what the American campus is about. @!HANNITY : And that 's the answer if that was true. David, last word for David -- go ahead. @!HOROWITZ : This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time you 're on this show -- @!HOROWITZ : I have an article -- @!LEVINE : -- you admitted you never even wrote -- you never even wrote an article about me accusing me of this. @!HOROWITZ : I have an -- @!HANNITY : Last word David. @!HOROWITZ : I have an article written by him appearing in al Jazeera magazine in which what he says of Hamas is that Hamas is willing to recognize Israel and the Israelis are liars for saying that they do n't. Hamas has in its charter that Islam will obliterate Israel. And in its charter there 's a saying of the prophet that the day of judgment will only come when the Muslims kill the Jews. @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : All right. We have to go. Guys, thank you. We are out of time. And there is plenty more @!HANNITY coming up, straight ahead. Please stay with us. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : I am very regretful. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HANNITY : The teacher caught on tape beating a 13-year-old student breaks her silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children 's weight. Plus, comedian Jay Mohr is here with his hilarious new book. Much more @!HANNITY straight ahead. '
