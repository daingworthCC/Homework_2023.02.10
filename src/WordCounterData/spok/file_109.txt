237641 ANDREW HOLTZ, CNN Health Week : War always brings casualties and whenever battle lines are drawn, just behind them are the medics, physicians and nurses prepared to care for the wounded ; but this time, United States forces will have the most sophisticated medical technology ever seen in a war zone. Eugenia Halsey reports. EUGENIA HALSEY, CNN Health Week : voice-over The army says it 's almost like having an advanced trauma center near the front lines. Two mobile CT scanners should enable doctors to locate wounds, especially those in the head and neck, much faster than they could in Vietnam and save more lives. Dr. DAVID SA'ADAH, Army Surgeon General 's Office : When you 're dealing with the head, where every structure is relatively small and quite vital, this kind of information, given in a timely manner, is certainly- we can expect will be beneficial- HALSEY : voice-over Unlike traditional X-ray techniques used in Vietnam, CT scanners can provide three-dimensional pictures of the body and detect not only bullets, but dirt, shrapnel and non-metallic objects. They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -though actual bleeding within the brain can be a major source of permanent damage to the tissue around it @!HALSEY voice-over The goal is to get the seriously wounded to the scanners, either by ambulance or helicopter within an hour of being injured. The army also ca n't predict whether two scanners would be enough, but says there are additional scanners on Navy hospital ships in the Gulf. Their names are the Comfort and the Mercy, their mission, to offer both. Admiral DONALD HAGEN, Commander, Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD : When you take an American- a wounded person from the beach and from the combat environment and then you move him into a ship, it 's like being home @!HALSEY voice-over The Navy has plenty of experience with floating hospitals. It operated the Repose and the Sanctuary during the Vietnam war. Dr. Jack Zimmerman was an internist aboard the Sanctuary. He says today 's hospital ships have a lot more space, beds and operating rooms and a much smoother system for getting patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue Armstrong was a nurse on the Sanctuary in 1967. She says it was similar to a hospital on land, with one exception. SUE ARMSTRONG, Nurse : Ships do move and we did have a lot of problems keeping all the equipment tied down @!HALSEY voice-over Nurses, doctors and patients also got seasick. The Navy says today 's ships are bigger and have less movement, so seasickness is n't as much of a problem and Armstrong thinks there are few obstacles the staff ca n't overcome. Nurse ARMSTRONG : You sleep and you eat and you take care of patients and you really do n't have any desire to do anything else @!HALSEY voice-over Armstrong says the ship 's technology is up to date and if the wounded can be saved, they will @!HOLTZ Many of the doctors and nurses sent to the Gulf were called up from reserve duty. Jim Hill reports on final training for reservists who will staff battlefield hospitals. WEAPONS INSTRUCTOR, Navy Reserve : Identify your target! OK! JIM HILL, CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training you think of for doctors, nurses and medical technicians, but these Navy reservists are part of a special unit that will set up battlefield hospitals in the Gulf war. 1st NAVY RESERVIST : We do n't normally carry weapons - according to the Geneva Convention, we 're not supposed to - but if somebody 's steaming at you, you know, I mean, I 'm going to protect my life and my wounded soldiers @!HILL voice-over The 950 people getting their final instructions, briefings and medical check-ups are part of the largest activation of reserves the Navy has ever made. Their job will be to set up one of two hospitals on land for treating combat casualties, only 75 miles from the front lines. on camera The reservists being activated here run the gamut from teenage hospital corpsmen all the way up to doctors and nurses in their 50 's with 20 or 30 years in private practice. Capt. LOREN LESLIE, Commander, Fleet Hospital 20 : From the standpoint of their ability to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skill and talent @!HILL voice-over The reservists have come from hospitals and private practice in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Although the talent drain is not considered critical to this region, the specialists are still a precious resource. 2nd NAVY RESERVIST : Well, we already have a nursing shortage throughout the United States @!HILL voice-over The members of this huge medical team know they 're facing their biggest challenge, up to two years of active wartime duty performing major surgery in movable hospitals that take as little as 10 days to set up. 3rd NAVY RESERVIST : This is something we 've trained for, professionally and clinically. This is a challenge @!HILL voice-over Like doctors and medical technicians everywhere, there people hope their life-saving skills wo n't be needed, but like reservists everywhere, they say they hope for the best but are ready for the worst @!HOLTZ More on the medical response to war when we come back. Commercial break HOLTZ : While United States forces have activated a medical system officials hope will be adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded fighters could overwhelm their national health system. Mitch Leppard from London. MITCH LEPPARD, CNN Health Week : voice-over As British troops prepare to fight in the Gulf, British health authorities are preparing for the worst at home. Fears up to 7,500 casualties could arrive in the first week of war have some concerned Britain 's health service could collapse. PETE MARSHALL, Confederation of Health Service Employees : The service is just not geared up for that sort of emergency level. The service is geared up for maybe one major rail accident or one major aircraft accident and it can cope with that, but we 're talking about something on the scale of 14 major aircraft disasters happening every day for a week @!LEPPARD voice-over Government health officials are confident. Medical services are on standby to ferry injured to designated hospitals, hospitals already treating large numbers of patients. WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, British Health Secretary : We have, for 40 years, been planning against a much direr possibility, namely, of a war against the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more formidable enemies than we would face in the Gulf ; and if we had contingency plans for that, we can have contingency plans for Iraq all right @!LEPPARD voice-over But a Gulf war could produce enormous numbers of wounds difficult to treat, like burns. There are 30 British burn units countrywide, but each can treat only five serious cases at a time. MIKE BROUGE, Royal Free Hospital : Once we receive major burns - and by that, I mean very extensive burns rather than patients with a very small area of burns - we will then have to be in some form of compromise situation. The treatment will not be a full standard treatment @!LEPPARD voice-over Another medical nightmare, a chemical weapons attack. TONY STAPLETON, John Ratcliffe Hospital : Yes, we know that there are certain items of warfare that our surgeons have not experienced and for some while now, they 've been reading and learning about how to cope with that particular contingency @!LEPPARD voice-over Soldiers will be treated in the field for up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're airlifted to the UK. Battle-wounded will take priority over all but the most serious civilian cases. Those who claim medical services are not ready say the government did n't want it known public hospitals would be used for military casualties and they say the national health service should re-open hundreds of beds closed for lack of money. Mr. MARSHALL : Nothing seems to have actually been done to prepare the health service for that because of this order of secrecy, that we 're not allowed to talk about the problems ; and therefore, my members who work in the health service have n't been told anything at all officially about what is likely to happen next week @!LEPPARD voice-over The health service says hospitals should treat patients first and worry about money later. Sec @!WALDEGRAVE We 've told the health authorities that they must n't hold back on doing anything that is necessary, for lack of money. I 'll have my argument with the Treasury afterwards @!LEPPARD voice-over Practice sessions have been held in recent weeks, including at the Operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 14 regional health centers @!HOLTZ While no formal arrangements exist for medical cooperation between allies, a spokesman for the U.S. military said patients who need care will not be turned away. More on the medical response to war in a moment. Commercial break Casualty Care HOLTZ : This war is the first time VA hospitals have been asked to take patients directly from the war zone. Department of Veterans Affairs officials this week tried to assure Congress they are ready. Eugenia Halsey reports @!HALSEY voice-over If the war fills up corridors like these in military hospitals, veterans hospitals will be expected to provide back-up help, but some in Congress want to know if the VA, already strapped by budget constraints, is, in one senator 's words, as fit for duty as the men and women of Operation Desert Storm. Sen. BARBARA MIKULSKI,( D) Maryland : We have a moral obligation to give them the best health care modern medicine can provide sick, if they need it @!HALSEY voice-over The VA says it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs : This could be our finest hour @!HALSEY voice-over During World War II, military hospitals had 500,000 beds for casualties, today just 14,000, so if those beds fill up, the Defense Department is counting on veterans hospitals to provide up to 25,000 more beds. But about 2,000 VA health care workers have been called away for military duty and some officials fear they wo n't have enough doctors and nurses. JOSE CORONADO, San Antonio VA Medical Center : Our main concern has to do with the reservists @!HALSEY voice-over VA officials say they 've only lost one percent of their health care workers, but some hospitals complain they 've lost more than others. Veterans groups also worry that some veterans will be pushed out to make way for new wounded. DAVID GORMAN, Disabled American Veterans : Well, I 'm cautiously pessimistic about what 's going to happen to the veteran population that is now in the VA hospitals and the VA 's ability to continue to provide medical services to those veterans @!HALSEY voice-over The VA says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top priority and the VA 's Medical Director says the hospitals have been drilling for the conflict. Dr. JAMES HOLSINGER, Chief Medical Director, Department of Veterans Affairs : The morale is high, they are ready to go. All of a sudden, for the first time in VA history, we become involved if we 're needed in the war during the war, not after the war @!HALSEY voice-over The VA acknowledges that some veterans who do n't need emergency care may have to wait or be treated elsewhere. It also says its ability to treat serious burns is limited, so those patients may have to be treated in military or civilian hospitals. on camera Questions have been raised about whether veterans hospitals can provide the best trauma care, but VA officials insist that with the help of university medical centers, they can @!HOLTZ The VA hospitals are one part of a medical system that also includes military hospitals and relies on civilian hospitals for back-up. voice-over At the Eisenhower Medical Center on Fort Gordon in Georgia, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigadier General JAMES HASTINGS, U.S. Army : We 've been designated as a primary casualty receiving site @!HOLTZ voice-over At the Veterans Affairs Medical Center nearby in Augusta, officials review their bed space every four hours. THOMAS AYERS, VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA : Our commitment is 25 percent of our operating beds @!HOLTZ voice-over Next door is the Medical College of Georgia. RICHARD BIAS, Medical College of Georgia : We would most probably be called upon to immediately handle the transfer of current patients at Eisenhower and the VA hospitals to free up their beds for the incoming casualties @!HOLTZ voice-over Eisenhower Medical Center will take patients either flown directly from the Gulf or transferred from military hospitals in Europe. on camera In most cases, one or more days will have passed before a patient gets to this hospital, so while the staff can provide emergency treatment, the focus here is on follow-up care. voice-over Trauma, gunshot, bomb patients may need more surgery. They may be threatened by infections or sudden lung inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, knowledge they hope they wo n't need. And then, there is the mental terror of war. Mr. AYERS : The additional stress and trauma of combat certainly has proven in the past and I 'm sure, unfortunately, has repeat itself, that demands for psychiatric beds will be high @!HOLTZ voice-over Eisenhower increased its bed count from 430 to almost 600, but the key is having enough nurses and doctors. Gen. HASTINGS : We have been helped enormously by the mobilization of the reserves and we 've gotten reservists who have joined us here and that 's what 's allowing us to increase our capability of handling larger numbers of patients @!HOLTZ voice-over Many of those reservists were taken from VA and civilian hospitals. While hospital officials in Augusta say they 're maintaining normal operations, more call-ups or extra patients could mean having to do more with less. Mr. BIAS : It 's an interesting scenario that we 've asked ourselves a couple of times and it really ends up being in a situation like that, you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. Supplies are on hand. Staffs are briefed and they wait for word that the ground campaign is under way. Gen. HASTINGS : Gee, my heart will skip a little bit. I think that 's what will happen @!HOLTZ voice-over And then their task will begin. on camera In the aftermath of destruction, physicians and nurses will try to heal. CNN 's medical unit will bring you that story, including a report on health care on the Iraqi side of the conflict. Doctors there say patient care was suffering even before the shooting started. That 's our program for this week. I 'm Andrew Holtz.
