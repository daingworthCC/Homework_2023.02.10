4103141 @!SCOTT-PELLEY-CBS-: Tonight, could it be? The economy turning a corner? A third quarter of increasing growth, a debt deal in Europe, and the Dow is on pace for one of its best months in decades. Anthony Mason is on Wall Street. When your life is a lie, how do you explain that to your wife? Ruth Madoff tells " 60 Minutes " about the day Bernie confessed to her. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-C@!@ @!RUTH-MADOFF: I was kind of paralyzed. Bernie got up and said I 'm going back to the office. @(END-VIDEO-C@!@ @!PELLEY: Hundreds of railroad workers cash in on disability and then head to the golf course. Sharyl Attkisson says it may have cost a billion dollars. And a mystery under the sea. Why do patients with paralysis seem to get better after diving. Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-C@!@ @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Almost all the subjects got stronger after going diving. Kind of completely blew us out of the water. @(END-VIDEO-C@!@ @!ANNOUNCER: This is the CBS EVENING NEWS with Scott Pelley. @!PELLEY: Good evening. If you were looking for the day the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government told us that growth accelerated in the third quarter - and have a look at the trend. Growth in the first quarter was 0.4 percent. In the second quarter, 1.3 percent. And today 's number 2.5 percent. That 's still weak, but there is a hint of momentum. Earlier today, the Europeans worked out a plan to contain their debt crisis and that sent markets surging. The Dow Industrials closed up 339.51, for October, the Dow is up more than 11 percent -- on track for its largest one-month percentage gain in 25 years, which brings us to our favorite picture of the day : a man on a German trading floor. Too much optimism in that face? Maybe. 14 million Americans are still out of work. So we turn for perspective to Anthony Mason at the New York Stock Exchange. Anthony? @!ANTHONY-MASON-CBS: That huge rally this month, Scott, has pushed stocks into positive territory for the year. The 2.5 percent growth in GDP shows the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stalled. That 's eased recession fears for the moment, but it has n't erased them. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!MASON: The mood may be improving on Wall Street, but there 's still nervousness on main street. In Naples, Florida, at the Bellini on Fifth restaurant, owner Max Furetta usually starts hiring for his peak season right about now. But the economic uncertainty worries him. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: We are profitable and we are making money, but we 're also very cautious about hiring new personnel. @!MASON: Consumer spending was surprisingly strong in the last quarter -- up 2.4 percent, the biggest jump since the end of last year. At Ford, auto sales revved up nine percent in September. @!ALAN-MULALLY: I think sales are going to continue to increase. @!MASON: So CEO Alan Mulally says Ford plans to add more than 12,000 new jobs in engineering and manufacturing over the next four years. @!MULALLY: We 're very pleased with the recovery. Would we like it to be more, yes, but clearly, the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasting a happier holiday season, projecting a 2.8 percent sales increase. That 's better than the average for the past decade. With electronics and appliance giant Best Buy says it 'll hire only 14,000 holiday workers this year, half the number it hired last year. @(on-camera) : And I 've heard it said that we 're one crisis away from a recession. Do you think we 're still at that point? @!MARK-ZANDI: Yeah, I think we 're very vulnerable. @!MASON-@1voice-over: Economist Mark Zandi says confidence will have to improve before businesses will aggressively hire again. @!ZANDI: Until that happens, our economy is going to be very fragile and at risk of anything else goings wrong we 'll go back into recession. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!MASON: So, the economy still faces some pretty strong headwinds -- the weak job market, the weak housing market and consumer confidence which Bloomberg said today has now sunk to the lowest level since the recession. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: Anthony, I want to ask you about that European debt deal that the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks to take a 50 percent loss on Greek debts, it strengthens an emergency bailout fund and it forces banks to keep more cash on hand. But I wonder, is that going to solve the problem? @!MASON: I think, Scott, what it does, is it buys the Europeans some time. There are still an awful lot of details to be worked out, but this is at least finally a realistic framework for a solution. @!PELLEY: That gross domestic product number that we got today, the value of all the goods and services in America, you 've been analyzing that and you found out something remarkable. @!MASON: Yeah, what we see now, Scott, is that the economy actually has finally recovered. The gross domestic product has hit $13.3 trillion, that surpasses the previous peak before the recession back in 2007. Now, at the bottom, GDP sank to $12.6 trillion, so technically the economy now has recovered. The job market, of course, is a different story. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is growing, economists that we talked to today told us that folks at home really wo n't feel it until the growth rate hits something more like four percent. The economic collapse exposed the colossal fraud of Bernie Madoff. He 's serving 150 years for swindling investors out of nearly $20 billion. His family has been in seclusion, but in a story for " 60 Minutes, " Madoff 's wife Ruth tells Morley Safer about the December day in 2008 when Bernie confessed to her. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!RUTH-MADOFF: I was kind of paralyzed. Bernie got up and said I 'm going back to the office. @!MORLEY-SAFER: Was he emotional in any way? @!MADOFF: I do n't remember that. He must have been. @!SAFER: Apologetic in any way? @!MADOFF: Probably. Yes. I 'm sort of a blind now. I 'm not hedging here, I do n't -- I just simply do n't remember every detail I was in such a state. @!SAFER: Later that day, that evening, you both turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He phoned me from the office and said we have to go to the office Christmas party. So I got myself together and went over there. We stayed a half an hour and we just went home. And the next morning the FBI was there to arrest him about 7:00 a.m. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!PELLEY: You can see the rest of Morley 's interview with Madoff 's wife and his son Sunday night on " 60 Minutes. " In Oakland, California, the police chief is promising a vigorous investigation into violent clashes there on Tuesday night. Anti-Wall Street protestors accused police of using excessive force. The confrontation left Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen with a fractured skull. But it 's not clear how Olsen was injured or who was responsible. Doctors today upgraded his condition to fair. There has been an increase in cross-border violence with a country that is supposed to be America 's ally. A top U.S. general said today that American troops in Afghanistan are increasingly coming under fire from across the border in Pakistan. Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghan side of the boarder have experienced a dramatic increase in mortar and rocket attacks launched from inside Pakistan. @!LT-GENERAL-CURTIS-: The cross-border fires this year are about - are over four times higher than they had been in the past - past years. They 're considerably higher. @!MARTIN: It 's not just the increase that worries Lieutenant General Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but the fact that some of the attacks are carried out under the noses of the Pakistani military which does nothing to stop them. @!SCAPARROTTI: We have seen indications where fires have originated from positions that were in close proximity to some Pakistan outposts which as you might imagine, give us great concern. @!MARTIN: The attacks are occurring in an area controlled by the Haqqani network, a violent insurgent faction which U.S. officials say is supported by Pakistani intelligence. It 's a baffling double game, in which, as Secretary of State Clinton explained, Pakistan backs Haqqani attacks on Americans like this one last month on the U.S. embassy while at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Haqqanis. @!HILLARY-RODHAM-C @! LI : This was done in part because I think the Pakistanis hoped to be able to move the Haqqani network towards some kind of peace negotiation and the answer was an attack on our embassy. @!MARTIN: Last week, Secretary Clinton warned the Pakistanis there would be a very big price to pay if they continue supporting terrorists. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!MARTIN: Since then, a Pentagon official says there have been no reports of cross-border shelling. @!PELLEY: David, thank you very much. Four days have passed since that big earthquake that rocked Turkey. The death toll is now 534. Survival for anyone buried alive today seems incredible, but it is not impossible. A rescue team from Azerbaijan found that out today when they pulled an 18-year-old man alive from the debris. A college student in Ercis had been trapped for 100 hours. He 's said to be in good condition, one of 185 people that authorities say have been found alive. And remember this rescue that we showed you on Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Today we saw the mother and child reunited at a hospital -- an image that gives comfort where comfort is scarce. We wondered how long people can survive, and the U.S. Geological Survey told us today that six days without food or water is about the limit. Federal prosecutors call it a billion-dollar fraud to scam disability pensions. The part-time Congress. The new House schedule means your congressman is n't likely to be overworked. And we go in search of the most typical human. The face that 's one in 7 billion when the CBS EVENING NEWS continues. @!PELLEY: Last week, we told you Social Security recipients are getting a raise tied to the inflation rate. Well, today we hear that seniors will be paying more for Medicare premiums next year. The government raised the basic monthly payment for Part B to $99.90 and for most folks that 's an a increase of about $3.50 a month. Talk about cleaning up in retirement, though. 11 people have been charged in New York tonight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of faking disabilities to fatten their pensions. The losses may be gigantic and we asked Sharyl Attkisson to look into that. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!SHARYL-ATTKISSON-: The suspects arraigned today in U.S. district court in Manhattan are accused in a widespread fraud connected to the Long Island Railroad, @!LIRR. The scheme awarded disability payments to nearly every retired union worker who applied. Preet Bharara @(ph) is the prosecuting U.S. attorney. @!PREET-BHARARA: Employees in many cases after claiming to be too disabled to stand, sit, walk, or climb steps retired to lives of regular golf, tennis, biking and aerobics. @!ATTKISSON: " The New York Times " first investigated in 2008 and videotaped supposedly disabled retirees enjoying golf, including former United Transportation Union official Joseph Rutigliano. Prosecutors say another defendant played tennis and golfed 140 times in 2008 while collecting over $100,000 in annual pension and disability payments. Others were observed shoveling heavy snow and riding a 400 mile bike tour around New York State. Also under arrest are two doctors who allegedly made millions running disability fraud mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 453 @!LIRR patients over four years and made $2.5 million in revenue from them. Those patients have got $90 million in disability benefits and are slated to get $210 million more in future payments. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!ATTKISSON: Authorities estimate the ultimate cost to the railroad retirement board could be a billion dollars. The defendants will continue to get their disability until and unless they 're found guilty. @!PELLEY: Sharyl, thank you very much. Our CBS News/ " New York Times " poll this week showed congressional job approval is at an all-time low -- nine percent. Well, this story wo n't help much. Today the House of Representatives announced that it will be in session for just 109 days next year which, of course, is an election year. By comparison, the House met 127 times last year, 159 times in 2009. A new way to treat paralysis. Can scuba diving help patients begin to regain their feeling? The results of a new study are next. @!PELLEY: The FDA is raising serious questions tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It says that the pill, called Yaz, puts women at a 75 percent greater risk of blood clots than older forms of birth control. A new study may be giving hope to people with paralysis. Researchers have found that patients had improved feeling and function after they had been scuba diving. We asked CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a CBS News contributor, to show us the results. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: My family, my friends. @!DR-SANJAY-GUPTA-C: Cody Unser seemed to have a story book childhood. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I liked defense a lot. @!GUPTA: She was a natural athlete with a famous father -- former race car driver Al Unser, Jr. It ended when she was 12. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I went down to touch my left leg and it was numb. I looked to my mom and said what 's happening to me? @!GUPTA: As documented by " 48 Hours " in 1999, Unseer was diagnosed with transverse miolitis, It 's a disease that causes the immune system to attack the spinal cord. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: Au! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: Yes! @!GUPTA: She was paralyzed from the chest down. Early on, one thing that gave her freedom from her wheelchair was scuba diving. Now 24 years old... @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: It 's so liberating and so freeing down there, you know? And my body just feels so -- I do n't know. I feel like I 'm flying. @!GUPTA: But you also notice something else, right? About the scuba diving in terms of your own body? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: Oh, yes. @!GUPTA: What else were you starting to notice? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I was starting to notice some sensation in my legs. @!GUPTA: Unser was so sure those sensations were from the scuba, she convinced her neurologists at Johns Hopkins and Kennedy Krieger Institute to study it. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: This is brand new. It has not been done and that 's why there 's no comparison. @!GUPTA: Neurologists Daniel Becker and Adam Kaplin took Unser along with ten paralyzed veterans on a four-day dive trip to the Cayman Islands. All were tested for motor control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depths of more than 60 feet, a depth where the pressure on the body is nearly triple the normal atmospheric pressure on the surface. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Biceps on the right is one, triceps is one. Almost all the subjects got stronger after going diving. And it kind of completely blew us out of the water. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I thought this is kind of odd. And it lasted for about three weeks. It was n't just in the water and then it went away as soon as I got up on the surface. @!GUPTA: At those depths, nitrogen builds up in the bloodstream. Researchers say the leading theory is that nitrogen accumulation in the subjects ' tissues as a result of repeated dives may increase levels of the chemical serotonin in their central nervous systems which might jumpstart nerves in the spine without input from the brain. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: There could be a back door in to reactivating sort of circuitry that already exists in the spinal cord and you just have to be able to go back and find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reteach it how to work again. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: Just throw it down. They say it will help create something that 's much larger than myself. I would love to walk again. And, you know, put my feet in the sand. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!GUPTA: Now, if results can be repeated in larger studies, researchers believe it could open up a whole new avenue of research for helping paralyzed patients regain function outside of things like electrical stimulation and stem cell transplants. In fact, this Hopkins team believes Cody may in her lifetime, Scott, feel her legs and be able to feel that sand in between her toes that she talked about. @!PELLEY: You know, Sanjay, I 'm curious. What do other neurologists think of this research? @!GUPTA: You know, what 's interesting. I think a lot of them were somewhat skeptical initially, thinking that scuba diving could actually cause a sort of @(inaudible) regain of function. Now they recognize that it appears to be true, figuring out what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you replicate that? Obviously you 're not going to take people on scuba diving trips all the time, but if there 's something specifically with the nitrogen, for example, can you deliver that in a different way? That 's what they sort of went ahead with this. @!PELLEY: Sanjay, thanks very much. @!GUPTA: Thank you, Scott. @!PELLEY: The human race is set to reach a milestone, which sent us in search of the most typical person on earth. That 's next. @!PELLEY: The U.N. says the world 's population will reach 7 billion on Monday, and that population is accelerating. From our first billion in 1804 to 4 billion in 1974 and past 6 billion two decades later. What are the most common characteristics of humans today? We sent Mark Strassmann to show us. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!MARK-STRASSMANN-C: Hidden in this crowd is someone who best represents all 7 billion human beings. @!KAIT @! LIN-YARNELL : What are the qualities or characteristics that make up each one of us? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine searched population data for humanity 's most common characteristics to create a profile of earth 's most typical person. The " National Geographic " researchers found 9 million people had the most in common. They overlaid the faces of 190,000 of them to create this image. Meet earth 's every man. @!YARNELL: He 's Han Chinese, he 's 28 years old. He is Christian. He speaks Mandarin. He does not have a car, does not have a bank account. You know, the reaction here among our staff was hey, I 've seen that guy. @!STRASSMANN: So we went looking for that guy. We called and e-mailed Chinese American groups around the country for help and one of them led us to Main Street in Queens, New York, and Mu Li @(ph). He arrived five months ago from Chongqing, a southwest China mega city of 28 million people. Li 's working in New York as a reporter for " The People 's Daily, " China 's state newspaper. @(on-camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Mandarin your first language? @!LI: Yes. @!STRASSMANN: Can you read? @!LI: Of course I can, yes. @!STRASSMANN: You have a lot of the qualities of the typical person. @!LI: You know I have a common face. Yes. Common background. Yes. Suddenly you realize, you say. Wow! You are the most typical person in the world. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!STRASSMANN: Li fits other criteria. He 's right-handed, works in a service industry, lives in a city, owns a cell phone but no car. This is the photo. We showed him " National Geographic 's " composite image. @(on-camera) : Do you see yourself in that photograph? @!LI: Yes. @!STRASSMANN: But you 're better looking than that @!LI: Well, do you think so? @(laughs). @!STRASSMANN: Li 's rein as earth 's everyman will not that long. Earth 's population could reach 8 billion people in 2026. By then the most typical human will be from India. Mark Strassmann, CBS News, New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS EVENING NEWS for tonight. For all of us at CBS News all around the world, good night.
