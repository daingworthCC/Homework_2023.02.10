4172642 @!MIKE-EMANUEL, -FOX-CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Bret -- good evening. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one team. And starting January 20th, Inauguration Day, they will have a new coach, and they intend to hit the ground running. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!MIKE-PENCE-( R), VICE PRESIDENT -ELECT : The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare. @!EMANUEL# Vice President-Elect Pence was back on Capitol Hill for the first full work day of the 115th Congress and tweeted a photo of his meeting with House Republicans. His goal was firing up the GOP about moving forward on a new agenda. @!PENCE# We are 16 days away from the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. Today our message is very simple -- working with the leadership here in the House and in the Senate. We 're going to be in the promise-keeping business. @!EMANUEL# As Pence was heading to Capitol Hill, President-Elect Trump took to Twitter to warn " Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases like the 116 percent hike in Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless. Do n't let the Schumer clowns out of this web. Massive increases of Obamacare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight -- be careful. " Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader fired back. @!SEN-CHUCK-SCHUMER-(D), MINORITY LEADER : Republicans will soon learn that you ca n't keep the good parts of the ACA and remove the rest of the law and still have it work. @!EMANUEL# Pence said he echoed Mr. Trump 's social media message behind closed doors. @!PENCE# I admonished members of the House Republican Congress today. It 's important that we remind the American people of what they already know about Obamacare. The promises that were made were all broken. @!EMANUEL# And Speaker Paul Ryan said while repeal of the President 's signature healthcare law would come swiftly, lawmakers will be careful to make sure consumers are n't hurt. @!REP-PAUL-RYAN-( R-W# We want to make sure that as we give relief to people to Obamacare, we do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anybody during that transition period. That 's the point that we are all trying to make. @!EMANUEL# As Republicans leaders call for an orderly transition, what comes next is unclear. Some GOP members are proposing a simultaneous repeal and replace. Others are suggesting a lengthy and deliberative process of two to four years to limit disruptions. After a lunch with GOP senators, Pence was asked what happens if replacing the law gets messy. @!PENCE# The simple fact is the American people know who owns Obamacare. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!EMANUEL# Lawmakers are hoping to have the Obamacare repeal on President Trump 's desk by the February 20th. Before that Pence said Mr. Trump will take a series of executive actions to start unraveling the law -- Bret. @!BAIER# Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thank you. Despite the fact that Republicans will soon control both chambers of Congress and the White House, President Obama wants to make sure his party does not let his signature health care law go down without a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House on the President 's nonspecific but impassioned push to hold on to his legacy domestic policy achievement. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!KEVIN-CORKE, -FOX-NCORRESPONDENT : Less than three weeks before he begins a long and reflective walk into history, President Obama left a short message for the congressional Democrats he will leave behind. @!BARACK-OBAMA, -PRES# Look out for the American people. @!CORKE# Look out for the American people as in, continue to fight for his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. Mr. Obama 's comments following a rare trip to Capitol Hill for a closed-door meeting with House and Senate Democrats. @!SEN-CHUCK-SCHUMER-(D), NEW YORK : The President articulated the importance of preserving the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid as only he can. And it was an inspiring meeting for all of us. @!REP-ELIJA-CUMMINGS# He basically said he envies us because he would like to be still in office to some degree, to fight with us. @!REP-NANCY-PELOSI-( # The President 's message was one of confidence, confidence in the Affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, confidence in its implementation. @!CORKE# From creating national monuments in Utah and Nevada to banning offshore oil drilling in the arctic, deleting the database of Muslim men at the Department of Homeland Security and expelling Russian operatives because of alleged hacking during the run-up to the election critics suggest the President 's trip to the Hill today to pitch the merits of Obamacare was little more than yet another push to preserve his legacy. And at least one Democrat, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, wanted no part of it. @!SEN-JOE-MANCHIN-( D# I thought it would be counterproductive for me to go and sit there. And I thought why could n't we have come together? Why could n't he have invited both sides and said whoever wants to come, come, we 'll give you our opinion? @!REP-STEVE-SCALISE-# I hope he comes here to apologize for those broken promises. But I do n't think that 's what 's going to be the case. he is going to be here more concerned about preserving his legacy than about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Obama is concerned about the prospects of seeing much of his agenda undone in the coming years but they 're holding out hope that Democrats who will serve long after he 's gone will stand up to the GOP. @!JOSH-EARNEST, -WHIT# The people who are in by far the best position to prevent that from happening are congressional Democrats who are unified around the idea that those things are worth fighting for. @!CORKE# A clamorous political battle ahead at a time when most presidents quietly walk off the national stage. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!CORKE# Keyword there, most presidents are expected to sort of walk away quietly. Not this one, apparently. And Bret -- we can tell you that while the White House acknowledges the President will likely remain engaged behind the scenes in many of the policy and agenda items that basically shaped his presidency over the past eight years, we also learned tonight that Vice President Joe Biden will have posts at both that the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware where he is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Back to you. @!BAIER# Kevin Corke, live on the north lawn. Kevin -- thank you. President Obama meantime will stay here in Washington, D.C. with his family. Now some perspective and a look back. The term " Obamacare " began as one of derision, but the man whose name it carries eventually came to embrace it with gusto. As our chief Washington correspondent James Rosen reports tonight from the White House, just about everything associated with the President 's signature domestic policy has been shrouded in controversy from the very beginning. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!JAMES-ROSEN, -FOX-NCHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT : It was the defining promise of Barack Obama 's presidency. @!OBAMA# If you like the plan you have, you can keep it. @!ROSEN# That promise repeated three dozen times made the patient protection Affordable Care Act, the law better known as Obamacare -- the President 's most contentious domestic initiative. At town halls, critics vented their anger, in part stirred by the Tea Party Movement -- @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# Strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose to oppose what it called socialized medicine. Even a bipartisan brainstorming session at Blair House saw the President abrade( ph) his 2008 opponent. @!OBAMA# We are not campaigning. The election 's over. @!ROSEN# To cover the 44 million Americans who lack health insurance, the 900-page measure expanded Medicaid subsidies, offered online exchanges embraced by 39 states, fined noncompliant employers and penalized uninsured people. The measure also allowed children to remain on parents ' plans through age 26 and banned insurers from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions. When Republicans mustered 41 votes against Obamacare, the Democrats employed the parliamentary tactic of reconciliation, requiring only 51 votes for passage. @!BAIER# And we do n't know exactly what 's in the fixed bill. Do you -- @!OBAMA# No, we will -- by the time the vote has taken place, not only I will know what 's in it, you will know what 's in it. @!ROSEN# The House Speaker memorably reversed that. @!PELOSI# We need to pass the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!ROSEN# Ultimately Obamacare passed with no Republican support and was signed into law in March 2010. As its provisions took effect, the online exchanges suffered pervasive glitches and an estimated four million people lost their plans, if violations of the President 's promise for which he begrudgingly apologized. @!OBAMA# And, you know, that 's on me. @!ROSEN# More than 20 million Americans have received coverage under the law. @!OBAMA# For the first time in our history, more than 90 percent of Americans are insured. @!ROSEN# But it has been dogged by problems. @!BILL-CLINTON-(D), -# and then the people are out busting it sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It 's the craziest thing in the world. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!ROSEN# Regardless of how the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare goes, it will go down in history as one of the most ambitious White House projects of the post-war era. And if it is discarded by the Trump administration, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Bret. @!BAIER# James Rosen in the White House briefing room. James -- thank you. The President-Elect says he is suspending judgment until Friday over whether Russia really was behind the hacks of the Democratic Party and the Clinton officials leading up the U.S. election. Friday is when President- Elect Trump is expected to receive a briefing by leaders of the intelligence committee about what they know. But the CIA director is not waiting until then to say he has proof Russia is to blame. Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has our report tonight. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!JOHN-BRENNAN, -CIA-# He 's not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity. @!CATHERINE-HERRIDGECHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT : In the PBS interview, CIA director John Brennan cast doubt on the credibility of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who told Fox News the Russian government was not his source for the DNC and Clinton campaign emails. @!BRENNAN# I would n't, you know, ascribe to any of these individuals for making comments that it is providing the whole, unvarnished truth. Again, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know about what happened, what was collected, what disclosed. @!HERRIDGE# Pressed on the hacker 's intent, which usually requires intelligence from human spying or an intercepted phone call, Brennan promised specifics. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF, -PBS# Do you think the motive of the Russians was to help Donald Trump? @!BRENNAN# That 's one of the things that will be addressed inside their report. I 'm not going to address that in advance of its release. @!HERRIDGE# In 2010, Assange 's WikiLeaks worked with then Army Private Bradley Manning to release several hundred thousand classified Defense Department documents, endangering sources and methods, according to a former FBI operative. @!TIMOTHY-GILL, -FORM# Sensitive intelligence is just not words on paper but it 's lives in danger. @!HERRIDGE# At the time, Donald Trump told Fox 's Brian Kilmeade the leaks were un-American. @!DONALD-TRUMP-( R), PRESIDENT-ELECT : it 's a disgrace. @!BRIAN-KILMEADE, -FOHOST : You do n't think it 's a disgrace -- @(inaudible) @!HERRIDGE# In the new Fox interview broadcast Tuesday, Assange also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails was child 's play. @!JULIAN-ASSANGE, -WI# Podesta gave out that his password was the word " password ". His own staff said this e-mail that you 've received, this is totally legitimate. So this is something a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year- old kid could have hacked. @!HERRIDGE# In a tweet Mr. Trump picked up Assange 's charge saying the Democrats were careless and to blame. On Capitol Hill, the Vice President - Elect defended his boss. @!PENCE# Given some of the intelligence failures of recent years, the President-Elect has made it clear to the American people that he 's skeptical about conclusions from bureaucracy and the American people hear him loud and clear. @!HERRIDGE# Although the Republican House Speaker told a conservative radio show he has no opinion of Assange. @!RYAN# Other than the guy is a sycophant for Russia -- he leaks, he steals data and compromises national security. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!HERRIDGE# Tonight Fox News is told the classified report is virtually complete and President Obama could be briefed as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence James Clapper and the NSA director Mike Rogers will testify to the Senate about foreign cyber threats to the U.S. -- Bret @!BAIER# We 'll follow it. Catherine -- thank you. @!HERRIDGE# You 're welcome. @!BAIER# So what do you think? Do you think President-Elect Trump is right to seemingly side with Julian Assange over the intelligence community about Russia and the hacks? Or at least express that skepticism on Twitter? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier, you can use the #SpecialReport or on Facebook at facebook.com/BretBaierSR. We may use your comments later in the panel. President Obama asked for a seamless transition to the next president at his last meeting with his top military leaders today. The commander-in- chief said he 's doing everything possible to ensure that Donald Trump benefits from the advice of his current military brass. He cited the ongoing fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as conflicts the next president will inherit. President Obama was then honored for his service at a ceremony at Joint Base Myer in Virginia where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!OBAMA# We live free under the red, white, and blue because of patriots like you. It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve with you. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# The U.S. and its allies are doubling the number military advisors helping Iraqi forces battle ISIS in Mosul. For the first time, the Pentagon admitted U.S. forces are operating inside Mosul saying the forces are moving in and out of that city. But a U.S. military spokesman said the advisors are not operating on the front lines there. Four Gitmo detainees are slated to be transferred to Saudi Arabia in the next 24 hours -- the first of the final wave of up to 20 transfers expected before inauguration day. U.S. officials are telling Fox News, they say that President-Elect Trump strongly opposes any more transfers off the base. But senior Pentagon officials saying until Trump is president the transfers will go on as scheduled. Well, candidate Donald Trump held his last formal press conference 161 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sent nearly 1,300 tweets weighing in on everything from nuclear arms to who may be performing at his inauguration. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports from New York tonight on the latest news coming out of Trump Tower. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!PETER-DOOCY, -FOX-NCORRESPONDENT : The inauguration is inching closer and closer but the President-Elect still does n't think people get him. He tweeted today about a 16-year-old singer set to start his ceremony with the National Anthem by saying this. Quote, " Jackie Evancho 's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance. Some people just do n't understand the movement. " Mr. Trump is also using Twitter to forecast that we will see headlines about additional American companies doing what Ford just did, investing in the States to avoid hefty import taxes. Writing quote, " Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning, much more to follow. " A big part of the Trump economic plan is cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure companies are still following the new rules. So he picked regulatory lawyer, Jay Clayton to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. That selection comes as Mr. Trump 's pick to be the next secretary of State is working ahead of next week 's confirmation hearings to eliminate any concerns about a conflict of interest with ExxonMobil where he was on the payroll until New Year 's Day. Rex Tillerson is in line to get $180 million from the oil giant as a retirement package, money that would go into a trust that would not be allowed to invest back in Exxon stock. Two other picks for top Trump administration jobs are having bumpier beginnings to ' 17. Liberal groups are up with ads accusing Trump Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin of profiting off the foreclosure crisis. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# Tell Senator Heller to vote no on Mnuchin. @!DOOCY# And in Mobile, Alabama, an NAACP protest about decades-old comments made by Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump 's pick for Attorney General got half a dozen people arrested, including that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now outlining his plan of attack against Senator Sessions, one of the eight nominees he wants to slow down on their way to the cabinet room. @!SCHUMER# It 's hard for me to countenance an attorney general who is so anti-immigration. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!DOOCY# The President-Elect has expressed very little faith in the intelligence community. But just a few minutes ago, a senior transition source texted to confirm that a leading contender to come in and clean things up as the next director of National Intelligence is former Indiana Senator Dan Coats. Sources tell our colleague Mike Emanuel that the Vice President -Elect, Indiana governor Mike Pence is really pushing the Indiana connection with that one -- Bret. @!BAIER# Peter Doocy outside Trump Tower. Peter -- thank you. Turkey 's foreign minister says they know the suspect behind the New Year 's Eve nightclub attack that killed 39 people in Istanbul but they still have not named him publicly. The state-run news agency reports police have detained 20 suspects, including 11 women who are believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that attack but tonight suspect who carried it out is still on the loose. Police in Istanbul have set up checkpoints and are checking vehicles across that city. Israel 's prime minister is calling for the pardon of an Israeli soldier convicted today of manslaughter in the death of a wounded Palestinian attacker. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's request for a pardon plunges him into a political debate that has divided the country over this case and puts him at odds with the Israeli military. Israel 's president has the authority to issue a pardon but said he will wait for the legal process to run its course before making a decision. Up next, a closer look at some of the conservative credentials of President-Elect Trump 's picks to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. First, here is some of what our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 13 in Seattle where health officials have confirmed nine flu-related deaths in Washington just three weeks into the flu season. The state 's Health Department says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state. Doctors seeing the spike in flu cases are urging everyone to get a flu shot. Fox 35 in Orlando where Republican Governor Rick Scott wants nearly $6 million to hire more state agents dedicated to counterterrorism efforts. The governor 's request follows last year 's terror attack on the Pulse Nightclub that left 49 people dead. And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate Fox 5. The big story there tonight a train derailment during this morning 's rush hour that injured more than 100 people. Investigators say a Long Island railroad train hit the bumping block as it came into the Brooklyn station a little after 8:00 this morning. New York 's governor said the most significant known injury was a possible broken leg. The cause of the crash is still under investigation -- one of several in that region in recent months. That is tonight 's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We 'll be right back. @!BAIER# Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer promises a fight over President-Elect Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even before he has a chance to try to block any potential nominee, some pro-life leaders are raising their own concerns over some of the conservative credentials on the President-Elect 's list so far. Chief legal correspondent, Shannon Bream joins us now live with a look some of their records. Good evening -- Shannon. @!SHANNON-BREAM, -FOXCHIEF LEGAL CORRESPONDENT : Hi -- Bret. Well yes, the new senate minority leader is not going to take it easy on the President-Elect 's Supreme Court nominee once we find out who that will be. Schumer says the GOP basically stole the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Scalia by refusing to move on the President 's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. And it sounds like things could get complicated on Capitol Hill. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!SCHUMER# It 's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So, you are right. @!RACHEL-MADDOW, -MSN# And so you would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!SEN-MITCH-MCCONNEL# that is something the American people simply will not tolerate. And we 'll be looking forward to receiving a Supreme Court nomination and moving forward on it. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BREAM# It is not surprising the left would question Mr. Trump 's eventual nominee but there are growing concerns from some on the right as well. A coalition of pro-life groups and leaders just sent a letter saying they are worried about some of the candidates on the list of 21 potential picks Mr. Trump has released. Quote, " We urge you to consider, not consider candidates lacking a pro-life record. Several of these judges on the list have even written or spoken in ways that are at odds with the pro-life position. " The Trump transition team says not to worry. All are being thoroughly vetted. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!LEONARD-LEO, -TRUMP# The President is working very hard to get this right and these are people who have very deep records that have to be analyzed very carefully and lots of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular statement or comment by any of these prospective nominees that can be viewed in isolation. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BREAM# First Liberty Institute, a group that takes on religious freedom legal fights has been pouring through all of the opinions of the judges on Mr. Trump 's list and says there 's a way to calm conservative fears. @!KELLY-SHACKELFORD, # There are many other excellent judges on the list that have no red flags ; and in fact, a very solid judicial background that would make excellent choices at the U.S. Supreme Court. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BREAM# It will take 60 votes in the Senate to get any Supreme Court nominee passed, the first procedural hurdle. So unless something changes, Republicans will need some help from across the aisle -- Bret. @!BAIER# Shannon -- thank you. The sentencing phase began today for the man convicted of killing nine black church members in South Carolina. And speaking before the court, the convicted killer did not ask jurors to spare his life from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on day one in court. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!JONATHAN-SERRIE, -FCORRESPONDENT : In his opening statement, Dylann Roof made no mention of his crime or his motives. Instead, the defendant calmly and quietly told jurors he chose to act as his own attorney to prevent his defense team from entering evidence about his mental health. Roof insisted quote, " There is nothing wrong with me psychologically. " The same jurors who last month convicted Roof in the 2015 massacre at Charleston 's historically black Emanuel AME Church must now decide whether he should spend the rest of his life in prison or face execution. Prosecutor Nathan Williams argued for the latter, citing Roof 's racist motives and lack of remorse for the crime. Williams read from a hand- written statement found in Roof 's cell a month after the crimes in which he states " I do not regret what I did. I 'm not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. I do feel sorry for the innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Prosecutors have begun calling on relatives of the nine deceased shooting victims to describe the emotional pain that Dylann Roof inflicted on their families and their community. @!MALCOLM-GRAHAM, -BR# There is no room for him in a civilized society. I believe there 's no room for him in America 's smallest jail. @!SERRIE# Malcolm Graham plans to testify about his sister, Cynthia Heard( ph) a dedicated librarian and active church member who perished in the shootings. He tells Fox News some crimes are so heinous the only logical penalty is death. @!GRAHAM# My sister and eight others died simply because they were there that and they were black. And that can not stand in a civilized society. And that has to be punished. @( END VIDEOTAPE) @!SERRIE# The hearing is expected to go into next week with prosecutors calling on as many as 38 witnesses. Dylann Roof on the other hand says he intends to call no witnesses and present no evidence. However, he does plan on making a closing argument -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. Crime in New York City is down according to data released today. The Big Apple had its fewest number of shootings last year and narrowly missed setting a record low for homicides. And overall crime was at its lowest in New York City. The city 's police commissioner says the numbers are the result of careful police strategies and increased work with communities. Democrats in California say they will challenge the incoming Trump administration on everything from immigration to the environment. And now state legislators have hired a former attorney general to help them do just that. National correspondent, William La Jeunesse from Los Angeles tonight on the man they have picked to lead their fight. @( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @!GOV-JERRY-BROWN-( D# If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellites. @!**26;708;TOOLONG CORRESPONDENT : Two weeks before Donald Trump even takes office, California is preparing for battle, hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder to challenge the new administration. @!ANTHONY-RENDON-(D)# It 's up to us in this body to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cynical, shortsighted and reactionary agenda that is rising in the wake of this election. LA JEUNESSE : From education to climate change, the state hopes to stop or stall Trump 's policy reforms. @!BROWN# We have the laws, we have the tools of enforcement, and we have the political will. And we will set the stage, set the example that whatever Washington thinks they are doing, California is the future. @!HANS-VON-SPAKOVSKY# By hiring Holder, it is like they are firing a shot across the bow of the Trump administration 's new liner. LA JEUNESSE : Former Justice Department lawyer Hans von Spakovsky wrote a book about Holder, the only cabinet member ever to be held in contempt of congress. @!SPAKOVSKY# It 's going to cost them a lot of money to try to fight the federal government, for example, on immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities. And in the end, they are going to lose. LA JEUNESSE : But with 38 percent of federal judgeships filled by Obama appointees, California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platform to sue. @!RENDON# We need to fight to protect our people and their rights. LA JEUNESSE : State lawmakers say they will pay Holder $25,000 a month to be a thorn in Trump 's side not unlike the hold Texas played against President Obama, filing 46 lawsuits, winning seven, losing or withdrawing 21, 18 are still pending. The first battleground, likely immigration as defiant state Democrats offer $80 million taxpayer to protect 2.3 million illegal immigrants from deportation, an approach endorsed by the L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# When people work under the table, when they 're pushed to the shadows, that depresses wages for native born folks.

Whether the outgoing president has a fighting chance to try to save Obamacare, his legacy, domestic policy issue. The all-star panel weighs in on that next. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!GOV-MIKE-PENCE, -( R) VICE PRESIDENT ELECT : The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our president-elect took his case to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country. @!CHARLES-SCHUMER, -( # Once they come up with a full replace plan, we will look at it, may be propose a change or two. But we 're not going to the minute after they repeal sit down with them and say let 's see what we can do now. @!NANCY-PELOSI, -( D-C# The president 's message was one of confidence, confidence in the Affordable Care Act, confidence in the humility that we have to listen to other ideas they have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And we should n't be opposed to that. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# President Obama meeting with Democrats. Vice president elect Pence meeting with Republicans up on Capitol Hill. The topic, Obamacare. If you look at this map from " USA Today, " it shows the premium rate increases around the country, and you can see there are some above 50 percent states in there, but a lot of them in the 30 to 50 percent shading on this. That does n't even include the deductibles that people are dealing with in their health care situation. This comes as the president-elect made clear his feelings on this battle. " Republicans must be careful. The Dems owned the failed Obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona. Also deductibles are so high that it 's practically useless. Do n't let the Schumer clowns out of this web. Massive increases in Obamacare will take place this year and Dems are to blame. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the warning on Twitter. A lot of people ask why do you read those tweets? That 's the way he 's communicating. So we 're reading them, what 's going on today. Let 's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, political columnist for " The Washington Times, " Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for the " Washington Times, " David Catanese, senior politics writer for " U.S. News and World Report, " and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of " National Review. " OK, Jonah, it seemed like the president went up there and said, hey, you guys need to stop this. When it came to how, what are they going to do, there was not a lot there there. @!JONAH-GOLDBERG, -SE# You can mark it as a 2017 miracle. I agree entirely with something Donald Trump tweeted. he 's absolutely right. This is a difficult position that the Republicans are in in part because a lot of Obamacare passed with 60 votes. You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how this is going to be -- the press is irresponsible in a lot of its talk about repeal. You ca n't keep all of the popular parts of Obamacare which Donald Trump promises to do and still call it repeal. It is something else. And lastly, because of Obamacare 's own internal flaws, it 's sort of like a suicidal dying patient. And the Republicans are leaping into be the doctor of record for the patient, and that 's a real political problem for them. They can make it die faster but they ca n't save it and they ca n't get a replacement for it very soon either. @!BAIER# So, Dave, are the Democrats saying you guys hold the old maid card now? @!DAVID-CATANESE, - " U# It 's incredible. You saw an entirely new frame of Obamacare presented today. The Democrats are now saying, they are labeling it Trumpcare as a potential replacement. They are saying Trumpcare will make you sick. And now the Republicans are sending out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think about how that has flipped. the bottom line is that leadership is going to have to come more than by tweets from the president-elect. Remember how President Obama got through the original health care reform. He drove the principles. They argued over the public option, whether there should be an individual mandate. We do n't know what president-elect Trump wants in that and he 's the only person that can unify the Republican Party. Otherwise you 're going to have legislators every day saying this is what I wanted, this is what I wanted, 100 ideas that 's not comprehensive. It has to come from Trump, has to come from the White House. @!BAIER# We should take a moment, Mercedes. It is the Republican 's ball now. The onus is on them. They have both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the president, you remember, said, he started his time in office saying 36 times if you like the plan you have, you can keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan that is falling apart. @!MERCEDES-SCHLAPP, -# President Obama is trying to save his legacy on Obamacare. He is telling the Democrats stand your ground. And he 's also saying he 's taking responsibility for the fact that they did n't communicate. They did n't message it correctly. This is not a messaging problem. This is a failed policy problem. This is the fact that you have Obamacare where you 've had tax increases, premium hikes. You 've had one in five consumers who now only have access to a single insurer. The majority of Americans are not happy. They disapprove of Obamacare. This is the opportunity for Republicans to take hold of this process. The problem is that if there 's one lesson the Republicans should learn it 's the fact that Obama pushed Obamacare and Congress pushed Obamacare only with Democrats. It was not a bipartisan effort. It would be wise for the Republicans to bring the Democrats along, create a bipartisan effort so both parties have responsibility. @!CHARLES-HURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is when people say that Obamacare -- Democrats admit that Obamacare is not working. Of course it 's working exactly as they intended. What it means is a lot of people who work are going to face huge premium increases to pay for people who previously did n't have health care. So it is actually working the way it was designed to work. @!BAIER# The problem was they were supposed to win the White House and change it into a bigger system. @!HURT# Right. As Mercedes says, this is the problem. The James Rosen package I thought had the most important quote of the entire effort where President Obama is sitting there meeting outside the White House with Republicans. He said we are not campaigning anymore and the election is over, as if, you know, campaigns are just politics where we say stuff that does n't mean anything. This is a knife fight now and we are pushing our agenda. And whether you call it health care reform or whatever, getting buy-in from Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's probably not a bad thing. And Trump is probably uniquely qualified to try to do that. @!BAIER# Here is Speaker Paul Ryan on people potentially losing insurance in this whole change. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!REP-PAUL-RYAN, -(R)# We have been saying all along we do n't want to pull the rug out from people while we are replacing the law. The point is in 2017 we do n't want people to be caught with nothing. We want to make sure that there 's an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# Jonah, according to HHS, they 've had 20 million people gaining health insurance since the law passed in 2010 to early 2016. But 4.7 million had individual policies canceled in 2013 because they did n't measure up. One in five consumers only has one insurer. You go through this list, and it 's pretty horrific. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from point A to point B. @!GOLDBERG# Right, the easiest part of the task in terms of messaging is that most of the people are signups on Obamacare are Medicare, and they are going to stay on that. You might have to tell them that may not be true couple years for now, but that 's fairly safe. The question is what you tell the people who have been jerked around by those clowns in Washington for six years in terms of their private, you know, market plans, all these other things, employer plans, been kicked off this, kicked off that, premiums going up, that the Republicans got in and they were supposed to have a solution and instead that process just accelerates for a while longer. sometimes firemen show up on the scene and they just let the building burned to the ground and then you build new. I do n't know that they have to do repeal on day one. Mercedes is right, there is room for Trump to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, if that 's the risk, it 's tough. @!BAIER# And they have a lot of things out there. They have crossing state lines. They have opening up the markets, health savings accounts, they have a lot of things but they do n't have one thing. @!CATANESE# And there is already disagreement about whether to even keep the taxes and place among Republicans. You guys are focused on the Democrats. The Republicans are n't unified on how to approach this. And I talked to a Senate leadership aide today who said Mike Pence told us he wants legislation by February 20th. That 's a month. Now, given everything else that 's going to suck up this news cycle, confirmation hearings, a Supreme Court pick, are Republicans going to be able to do this with repeal and a replacement within a month? that is a daunting task. This could consumed the entire first 100 days if not beyond Trump 's presidency. And they you 've got to ask the question, does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March, April, if it takes that long to do this? this is going to be a Herculean task to get through it. @!SCHLAPP# it 's a massive project, but at the same time guess who has a plan. It 's actually HHS cabinet nominee former Congressman Tom Price. He is the one that pushed forward this idea of the fixed tax credits, of expanding the health savings account ensuring that you can have a competition across state lines. There is a platform there, there 's a framework there for the Republicans to start. However, there is that sense of disagreement, and Republican leadership will be key in working with Trump to push forward something that would be acceptable to not only the moderate Republicans but the conservative Republicans who want to phase-in -- phase out quickly, in two years, as opposed to three to four years that the other Republicans want. @!BAIER# It will be a big battle, no doubt. You mentioned the Supreme Court. One of the biggest things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open vacancy and you have the Senate minority leader saying they are going to fight tooth and nail if the person that the president-elect and environment president puts forward is not right. Take a listen to Chuck Schumer on this. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!SCHUMER# It is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support. So you 're right. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# And so you would do your best to hold the seat open? @!SCHUMER# Absolutely. We are initiating a letter, hopefully signed by Democrats and Republicans. This letter simply says to Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, do your job, hold the hearing. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# They said multiple times, Chuck, obviously fill the seat, get Merrick Garland in. Hold a hearing. Now he is saying we may try to hold it open. @!HURT# Turnabout is fair play in politics But Donald Trump has taught Republicans one thing that is very good, and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court is a perfect example where Republicans have very much adopted the Democratic notion that it 's OK to twist the constitution anywhere you want to without constitutional amendments. And to go back to that original fight and have that fight in public, Republicans can win it, and Donald Trump will be a very good spokesman for that fight. @!BAIER# But quickly, Dave, can Democrats continue to fight on every issue, on every nominee, on everything? @!CATANESE# No. Look, Chuck Schumer did a big media tour yesterday and a lot of it was for the base to get them fired up, that I 'm your new leader and I 'm going to fight. He ca n't keep all these promises. They are in the minority. They are in an even bigger hole in the House. And they do n't have the presidency. @!GOLDBERG# They have the nuclear option. @!CATANESE# Right. And Schumer helped kill the nuclear option. He 's not taking credit for that now, but he 's saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the Democratic base, the donors out there who are still upset about this election, saying we are going to fight. We 're going to fight on all these things. We can do the fact-check in three months and see how much he lives up to his word. @!BAIER# We invited the Senate minority leader here on SPECIAL REPORT. Next up, a fact-check on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the back and forth over this intel. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# He 's not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity. And so therefore I would n't, you know, ascribed to any of these individuals for making comments that it is providing the whole, unvarnished truth. @!SEAN-HANNITY, -FOX-HOST : Can you tell the American people 1,000 present you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia? @!JULIAN-ASSANGE, -FO# We can say, and we have said repeatedly over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust the American patriots who work in the intelligence community who swear an oath and allegiance to the constitution and not some guy hiding from the law was a record of undercutting and undermining American democracy. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# Well, the fight over intelligence as the president-elect gets ready to get an intelligence briefing on Friday, and the leaders of the intelligence community pushing back against some of his tweets. Donald Trump tweeting, " Julian Assange said a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta. Why was DNC so careless? " Also said Russians did not give him the info. Then re-tweets, " FOX News, Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage. It 's very dishonest, more dishonest than anyone knows. " We are back to the panel. It seems clear, Mercedes, that the intelligence community is saying, listen, wait until you hear before you go after us. What about this public back-and-forth? @!SCHLAPP# I do n't like it. that one of the problems with the intelligence community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially around this election time, post-election in pushing forward the theory that the Russians have hacked and have basically said that Trump has been -- that the Russians went in favor of Trump. I spoke to a former national security advisor, part of the team that basically said that this is not normal. This is not what the intelligence community should be doing. They should not be going public with this information. what you 're going to find is that there is a chance Trump will hear the word circumstantial evidence, the likelihood, the possibility that this happened, and he 's going to need to make his own judgment from there. But Trump going public with this as well, I do n't think it 's favorable. @!BAIER# It is important to point out the history of Julian Assange. This is a " Times London " report on the WikiLeaks dangers back in 2010. " Hundreds of Afghan lives been put at risk by leaking 90,000 intelligence documents because the files identify informants working with NATO forces. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times " found the names of dozens of dozens of Afghans credited with providing detailed intelligence to U.S. forces. They 're villages are given for identification and also in many cases their father 's names. " Back in 2010, Donald Trump called that very problematic. Other people went further and said that he should be taken up on charges. @!GOLDBERG# I agree with 2010 Donald Trump. that a lot of things can be true. The WikiLeaks documents can be truthful. we know that they are true. Why ruin such a great platform by discrediting it with false information? It can also be true that propaganda is true. There 's nothing in the definition of propaganda that says it 's untrue. Julian Assange is an anti- American radical who detests this country, has said so explicitly and implicitly for years, does n't mind that he 's responsible for the deaths of western allies, who is a " Russia Today " host, and the rush by conservatives who moments ago were talking about what a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative for the Trump administration, is outrageous. It is not true, by the way -- it 's technically possible a 14-year-old could have hacked this, but it 's also absolutely true that a 14-year-old did not hack this, because the phishing app they used to get John Podesta was a classic piece of major intelligence gathering statecraft that is mostly used by foreign governments. And it 's not used by 14-year-olds or fat guys on their bed. @(LAUGHTER) @!BAIER# Charlie, it 's getting a lot of pushback inside the intelligence community. There are a lot of people out in America who say the intelligence community has been wrong before. Donald Trump is right to be skeptical and he should push and wait until he gets all the details. it just feels like, for some of these nonpartisan intel folks, that they are caught in the middle. @!HURT# Sure, they are. But it kind of reminds me a little bit of the people who are upset about the FBI, Comey being involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want the FBI inserting itself into the election, do n't nominate somebody who is being investigated by the FBI. Donald Trump, I ca n't disagree with what you all are saying about Julian Assange except that if he were a reporter and did n't hate the country, he were just be a reporter, he would be held up as the next Woodward and Bernstein for getting all of these files. He would be celebrated. But it 's a good thing for the president-elect to have this healthy skepticism about the intel. They have gotten things wrong. The weapons of mass destruction was not a slam dunk in Iraq. ISIS was not a jayvee team. All of that came from intelligence sources. So I just think everybody should sort of calm down a little bit right now and wait and see what happens. Let him get these briefings. @!BAIER# Dave, we just heard officially that the report is done. The president will be briefed about it tomorrow. Catherine reported some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president-elect on Friday. @!CATANESE# This is going to be the fault line where Trump could get into some real trouble with his own party. John McCain is holding a hearing tomorrow morning about this topic. He 's going to have James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, in front of him. I 'm sure Donald Trump is going to see it, be watching it, not like it. Maybe tweet about it. And then you 've got him going into this private briefing on Friday. And Trump has to be really careful. These are Republican hawks that are going to be against him that he needs for his confirmation. McCain already signaled today probably not going to be voting for Tillerson. If he Trump loses two more hawks, maybe Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, Tillerson goes down. @!BAIER# The House speaker saying " Assange is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks, he steals data, and compromises national security. " So this is not over as far as the story goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, more highlights from yesterday 's swearing-ins. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!BAIER# Finally tonight, the classic moments from the ceremonial Congressional swearing in family photos with vice president Biden and Speaker Ryan just keep on giving. Take a look. Vice President Biden going in for the kiss. Oh, no, rejected. Rejected by the baby. And then the dab photo form this. Speaker Ryan said, " do you want to blow your nose? " That 's what Speaker Ryan said. He said " What is your problem? " And he finally got it right. That 's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair balanced, and unafraid. Here comes Tucker.
