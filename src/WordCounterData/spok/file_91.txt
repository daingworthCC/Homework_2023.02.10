Just completely hooked. @!ROBERTS : She was driven and ambitious, even as a young girl. @!Ms-ALFANO : Oh, yes, yes. @(Photo-of-Kathy-gra) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) A typical type A personality, says close friend Nancy Vinnick. @!Ms-NANCY-VINNICK : Everything in her whole life was organized. @(Footage-of-Kathy) @!Ms-VINNICK : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color coordinated. @(Photos-of-Kathy) @!Ms-VINNICK : @(Voiceover) All of her suits were in order. She was a perfectionist to the T in everything that she did. @(Wedding-photo-of-K) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Except in picking her husbands. @!Ms-ALFANO : My daughter with men was not very wise. @(Wedding-photo-of-K) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) There were two brief marriages and a child before she was 30. @!Ms-ALFANO : She was so intelligent and so smart, but when it came to men, she had a soft spot. She could not make good decisions, except for Charles. @(Photo-of-Charles-A) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Charles Augustine, Kathy 's third husband, was an airline pilot 16 years her senior. @!Mr-PHIL-ALFANO-Jr. : I think Chuck kind of knew how to take my sister in stride with, you know, some of her perfectionism. @(Footage-of-Phil-Al) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Kathy 's brother, Phil. @(Photos-of-Kathy-an) @!Mr-ALFANO-Jr. : He used to refer to her as " she who must obeyed, " and, you know, had a sense of humor about it. So I think that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kathy 's political career took off, winning seats in the state legislature, then become controller, her ambitions grew, and so did the tensions at home. @!Mr-GREG-AUGUSTINE : He let it be known that he was n't going to be a part of the political limelight. @(Photo-of-Greg-Augu) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Greg Augustine, Charles ' son from his first marriage. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : He definitely was n't into what she wanted him to be into. qwq @( Photo-of-Kathy ; -fo @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) By 2003, after years of leading separate lives, the marriage was over. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : He did n't want to be divorced. @(Photos-of-Charles) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) He wanted to be married, but he knew it was inevitable. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) But before the agreement was finalized, Charles suffered a stroke. He died five weeks later with Kathy by his side. @!Ms-VINNICK : She did n't expect it.

He was a registered nurse living in Nevada. Who proposed to whom? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Kathy proposed to me. @(Photos-of-Kathy-an) @!Mr-C-HIGGS : @(Voiceover) It probably was a little quick, as far as getting married, but we did n't -- we did n't look at that.

I did n't talk about nursing, and we just -- we just were two people that fell in love. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) It was three years after they fell in love when Chaz found Kathy unconscious in their bed. In a matter of days, she was dead. @!Mr-C-HIGGS : I could n't believe it. And there are days even now I do n't believe it. I wake up and think I 'm in a dream. @(Footage-of-men-car) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) As Kathy Augustine was laid to rest, suspicion was growing about the cause of her death. @!Mr-GEORGE-HARRIS : There is no one I know that believes she had a heart attack.

She never was. qwq @( Footage-of-Kathy ; - @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete physical. @!Ms-ALFANO : And there was nothing wrong with her. @!ROBERTS : Two weeks before your daughter was taken to the hospital, she was the picture of health. @!Ms-ALFANO : Yes. @!ROBERTS : In fact, the preliminary autopsy found no evidence of a heart attack and no other obvious cause of death. But the medical examiner did find an unexplained mark on her buttocks. Detective DAVE JENKINS : We knew that we had a circumstance that raised eyebrows. @(Footage-of-Dave-Je) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) And Reno police had received a tip suggesting Kathy may have been poisoned. Detective Dave Jenkins launched an investigation. @(Footage-of-bedroom) @!Det-JENKINS : @(Voiceover) It would have necessitated someone who could have access to Kathy in the moments before she lapsed into unconsciousness. @(Footage-of-Jenkins) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) But Jenkins needed evidence that a crime had been committed.

I would n't do that. @(Footage-of-Chaz-en) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Higgs believes investigators are ignoring other possible suspects. After all, Kathy Augustine was known for being a controversial politician with lots of enemies.

She 's the black woman. Vote for me. ' @(Footage-of-poster) @!Mr-RALSTON : @(Voiceover) It was seen by many, many people as very, very racist. @!Ms-HARRIS : That was Kathy 's style. She would do whatever she need to do to get what she wanted. @(Footage-of-electio) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Augustine went on to beat Harris by 700 votes. @(Footage-of-Kathy) @!Mr-HARRIS : @(Voiceover) Kathy 's attitude was I 'm going to do what I got to do to get elected. If Kathy found a chink in your armor, she would take a howitzer and blow it apart. @(Footage-of-pamphle) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Augustine rode her " take no prisoners " style to the statewide office of controller in 1998.

' @(Footage-of-hearing) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Augustine Became the first person in the history of Nevada politics to face impeachment. The reason? For using her staff and state-owned office equipment in her re-election campaign. Nevada 's Republican leadership told Augustine that her political career was over. qwq @( Excerpt-from-heari Offscreen Voice : You must now answer forthwith with the articles of impeachment. @!Ms-AUGUSTINE : Not guilty, madam president. @(End-of-excerpt) @!Mr-HARRIS : As the fist fighter she was, she stood up to them and said, Pound dirt.

She was censured by the state legislature. @!Mr-HARRIS : Kathy was guilty of everything every other politician is guilty of, OK? Come on, let 's be realistic here. @!Ms-VINNICK : They brought her down politically.

It had to do with standing your ground, and when you know that what you did did not rise to the level of impeachment, then it was a matter of staying there and fighting for something you truly believed in. @(End-of-excerpt) @!Mr-RALSTON : She was not just ambitious and nasty, she was also indomitable. Nothing could keep her down. @!ROBERTS : Augustine launched a politically explosive investigation into financial misdeeds within her own party and then she went on to announce that she was going to run for the powerful job of state treasurer. Republican party leaders were stunned by what they felt was her betrayal. @!Mr-RALSTON : I think they were flabbergasted. @(Footage-of-newspap) @!Mr-RALSTON : @(Voiceover) I think they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do because some thought, you know what?

Was your sister threatened? @!Mr-ALFANO-Jr. : There were threats made to her. @(Footage-of-Chaz) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) We wanted to ask Chaz Higgs about all of this, but lead defense attorney Alan Baum told his client to watch what he said. @!ROBERTS : Did she ever talk about political enemies? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Yes. @!ROBERTS : People out to get her? @!Mr-ALAN-BAUM : We kind of have to be a little bit cautious in this area. @!ROBERTS : Can I ask whether or not threats were made against her life? @!Mr-BAUM : That 's an area that I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Barbara Woollen had plenty to say.

How it got there is what we 're trying to prove. @!ROBERTS : The prosecution believes Chaz Higgs injected his wife with a lethal dose of the fast-acting paralytic Succinylcholine, waited until she lost consciousness, then called paramedics and tried to pass the whole incident off as a heart attack. @!Mr-BARB : Succinylcholine killed Ms. Augustine. qwq @( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one around at the time the drug would have had to have been administered.

Because that still has n't been established. And then number two, if a crime was committed, the question is the obvious, who did it? @!Mr-BAUM : There are people that think that it had something to do with Kathy 's political career. qwq @( Footage-of-Kathy ; - @!Mr-BAUM : @(Voiceover) There are people who think she died of natural causes.

Please... @(End-of-excerpt) @(Footage-of-Ramey-i) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) At the preliminary hearing, Ramey said that during that talk, Higgs mentioned a well-known local murder case involving a man who had stabbed his wife to death. @!Ms-RAMEY :( In court) He said, That guy did it wrong. ' He said, If you want to get rid of somebody ' and he made a gesture like this. You just hit her -- you hit them with a little Sux because they ca n't trace it postmortem. ' And I said, Chaz, that 's too much anger to carry around. ' And the hair on my arm arose. That 's what I said. @(Footage-of-urine-s) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Based on Ramey 's telephone tip, the frozen sample of Augustine 's urine was immediately sent off for testing. How critical was that phone call to this investigation? qwq @( Footage-of-Kathy ; - @!Det-JENKINS : @(Voiceover) There is no doubt in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely enough to make a determination that a murder had been committed. Judge :( In court) You 're excused, Miss Ramey. You 're free to leave. @(Footage-of-courtro) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Higgs ' attorney David Houston dismisses Ramey 's account. @!Mr-HOUSTON : It in no way implicates any kind of motive, anger, or reason why Chaz Higgs would do the same thing to his wife in a very short period of time thereafter. It 's almost absurd. @(Footage-of-Chaz-be) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) But prosecutors point out that when Higgs was arrested, police found handwritten notes about Succinylcholine in his car. @!Mr-C-HIGGS : I have a lot of literature that I carry around. As part of my job, I have a lot of books and references that I carry around, and back packs that I would take to work. So I 'm sure I probably did have some literature on Succinylcholine along with about 1,000 other drugs, too. @(Footage-of-Chaz-in) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) In Higgs ' defense, David Houston will challenge all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Augustine. @!Mr-HOUSTON : That is about the size of a needle on an insulin syringe. If you were to administer the amount of Succinylcholine contained in an insulin syringe, you would not even receive a numb hip. @(Footage-of-Succiny) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) And he argues the amount of Succinylcholine detected by the urine test, is inconsequential. @!Mr-HOUSTON : What they euphemistically refer to as " traces. " I 'm not really sure what a trace is, but it 's certainly not enough to convict somebody beyond a reasonable doubt of murder. @(Footage-of-Troy-Ro) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) John Hiatt is a forensic chemist who is not involved in the Higgs investigation. How difficult is it going to be for the prosecution to try to prove that Chaz Higgs injected Kathy Augustine with Succinylcholine? @!Mr-JOHN-HIATT : That will really depend upon how good the evidence is with regard to the Succinylcholine in the urine sample. @!ROBERTS : Have you ever administered Succinylcholine? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Yes. @!ROBERTS : You have. Did you have access to the drug in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh, sure. I have access to a lot of drugs. @!ROBERTS : Were you in possession of this drug... @!Mr-C-HIGGS : No. @!ROBERTS :... in the months leading up to Kathy Augustine 's death? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : No. @(Footage-of-Succiny) @!Mr-BARB : @(Voiceover) Succinylcholine its not a recreational drug. If that 's present, somebody put it in her, and the only one that had the opportunity to put it in her was her husband. @(Footage-of-Chaz-in) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Higgs ' alleged use of Succinylcholine in Kathy Augustine 's death may turn out to be only the tip of the iceberg. Now, Charles Augustine 's sons have suspicions about their father 's death years ago. Suspicions about both Chaz and about Kathy. What do you believe is the truth? @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : We do n't know yet. Just speculating, I believe they conspired to see to it that my did did n't recover. qwq @( Footage-of-funeral @(Announcements) @(Footage-of-Chaz-be) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) After Chaz Higgs was charged with murdering Kathy Augustine, her stepsons Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : Kathy told me that he has suffered from massive organ failure and has passed away. And I instantly, my gut feeling was that 's not right. @!ROBERTS : What do you think happened to your father? @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : I think my father was murdered. @!ROBERTS : You, too? @!Mr-LARRY-AUGUSTINE : Yeah. qwq @( Photo-of-Charles ; - @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) The brothers believe they have good reason for their suspicions. Chaz Higgs was one of Charles Augustine 's critical care nurses. @!Mr-C-HIGGS : I was assigned to his care for one or maybe two shifts. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Although it was only a couple of days, it was long enough to catch Kathy 's eye. @!Mr-C-HIGGS : We went out for coffee and hit it off. We just connected. @(Photo-of-Chaz-and-) @!Mr-C-HIGGS : @(Voiceover) And one thing led to another and we fell in love with each other. @!ROBERTS : You were n't conflicted about dating Kathy Augustine while her husband was recovering from a stroke? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, no. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Higgs said Kathy told him she had been separated from Charles for five years. @(Photo-of-Charles-a) @!Mr-C-HIGGS : @(Voiceover) And she told me that basically there was nothing there. It was just a legal arrangement at that point. @(Footage-of-Greg-an) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Greg Augustine says he knew his father 's marriage was ending, but was still astonished by his stepmother 's behavior. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : At that point I thought it was completely inappropriate, and, you know, it was kind of a how dare you? He 's right here. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) And can you just maybe not do this in front of us? So I just lost a lot of respect for her then. @(Photo-of-Charles-) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) In the days following Charles Augustine 's death, the brothers say Kathy 's behavior got worse. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : And a lot of strange things happened. We were kicked out of the house. @!Mr-L-AUGUSTINE : This was extraordinarily bad even for -- even by Kathy 's standards. @(Photo-of-Augustine) @!Mr-L-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were all grieving and trying to come to a point of letting my dad go. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : She was acting very irrationally, doing the things that she did. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) But the brothers were even more flabbergasted when they learned their stepmother had married Chaz Higgs just three weeks after their father died. @(Photo-of-Kathy) @!Mr-L-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) This was a calculated lady. This was a move that her friends, family, nobody could explain. @!ROBERTS : Did n't she care about appearances? How this would look? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : She did n't care at all. I mean, you have to understand, she looked at herself as a single woman. @(Photo-of-Chaz-and-) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) At that point, I became very suspicious of the whole thing. Because deep down somewhere, I thought it had some stink on it to begin with. And now she marries this person three weeks later? I said, She 's either lost her mind or there 's a -- there 's a deal here somewhere. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaz Higgs may have poisoned their father with help from an accomplice. Given what you know now, do you believe that your stepmother, Kathy Augustine, played a role in your father 's death? @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : We 're speculating at this point, but I think she did. @(Footage-of-hospita) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) It was very convenient for my dad just to kind of slip away. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) So you believe that Kathy Augustine and Chaz Higgs worked in concert? @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : I believe they 're capable of it. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) The motive? According to Greg, with no signed divorce agreement, Kathy stood to inherent his father 's million dollar estate. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : If he dies, now she 's the living heir, she gets everything. We 're not talking about a whole lot of money, but it 's enough, I should say when you 're going into an impeachment, being investigated, you need money for counsel and I think it was convenient for all the parties involved. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : Unh-unh. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) And Greg believes when Chaz and Kathy 's marriage fell apart... @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : I think that Chaz decided to take matters in his own hands and make sure that the only other person that knows he was involved in my dad 's death is n't around anymore. @(Photo-of-Chaz-and-) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) That 's what I think. I do n't know. @!ROBERTS : Charles Augustine 's sons believe that you and Kathy may have conspired together to kill their father. @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Oh, my -- incredible. That 's just -- that -- it 's completely outlandish. It 's crazy. @(Photo-of-Kathy-and) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Have you ever contemplated the notion that Kathy Augustine and Chaz Higgs plotted together to kill Charles Augustine? @!Det-JENKINS : I have certainly heard that theory advanced. It 's an interesting speculation. I 'm not sure at this point that we 'll ever know for sure. @(Footage-of-medical) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) At the time of Charles Augustine 's death, there was no autopsy. But last October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas coroner 's office opened an investigation and ordered Charles ' remains exhumed. Tissue samples were tested for Succinylcholine, the same drug investigators believe Chaz Higgs used to kill Kathy Augustine. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : Knowing what I know about that drug now, I do n't think they 're going to find anything. @(Footage-of-Succiny) @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : @(Voiceover) I ca n't see that that drug will still exist in his body three and a half years later. So we may never know. @(Footage-of-Succiny) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) On Tuesday of this week, the toxicology results were released. According to the coroner 's office, there is no evidence Charles Augustine was poisoned by any drug, including Succinylcholine. But as Greg Augustine told us after hearing the news, with Succinylcholine, there is no 100 percent certainty. @!Mr-G-AUGUSTINE : I 'd like concrete proof and I do n't think I 'm ever going to get it, is the bottom line. They ca n't prove a murder happened. They ca n't prove a murder did n't happen. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine died of complications from a stroke, not foul play. As a result, Las Vegas police have closed that case. But at the preliminary hearing in the death of Kathy Augustine, a decision has been made. Judge :( In court) I do believe based on the testimony presented thus far that there is probable cause to bind over the defendant on the charge of murder. @(Footage-of-Chaz-in) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Chaz Higgs will stand trial for his wife 's murder. @!Ms-ALFANO : There wo n't be closure until he 's taken care of. @(Footage-of-courtro) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Kathy 's family will be there. @!Ms-ALFANO : It is n't going to bring her back, but it will give me the satisfaction. @!Ms-SHIRLEY-HIGGS : Chaz is innocent. @(Footage-of-courtro) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) And so will Chaz 's mother, Shirley. @(Footage-of-courtro) @!Ms-HIGGS : @(Voiceover) We just know he would never do anything like this. And we just want to see him come home. @(Footage-of-Chaz-le) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) Chaz Higgs has been released on $250,000 bail. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be only temporary. I know what your hopes are. What is the best case scenario in your mind? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : Best case is the truth is told and I 'm vindicated. @(Photo-of-Kathy) @!ROBERTS : @(Voiceover) And Chaz, what is the truth? @!Mr-C-HIGGS : That 's something I want to save for the trial. @(Graphic-on-screen) Chaz Higgs ' trial is scheduled to begin next month. Nevada authorities are no longer investigating alleged threats against Kathy Augustine by political enemies.
