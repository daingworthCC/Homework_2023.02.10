232941 A MAN OF PARTS @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Jerry Bowen is about to introduce us to A Man of Parts. Thighbones are among the parts in which he has considerable interest, and jaws and teeth, and ancient footprints pressed in stone and bits of petrified eggshell. All this will make sense in a moment or two, I promise. @(Footage-of-dump-tr) @!JERRY-BOWEN-report : @(Voiceover) Long before man discovered vast coal deposits along the Smoky River in western Alberta, Canada, tens of millions of years before the nearby mountains were even formed, there were dinosaurs here. And that is why Louis Psihoyos and friends are racing up the road. @!Mr-LOUIS-PSIHOYOS- : I 've become sort of -- I do n't know, by default, sort of the -- you know, the -- the Annie Leibovitz of -- of -- of old, dead things, I guess. qwq @( Photographs-of-din Chin up just a little bit, Mark. Le -- let 's say you have zero smiles now. Give me about... @(Visual-of-cover-of) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) Louis Psihoyos takes remarkable photographs of dinosaurs and the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brush? @(Footage-of-Psihoyo) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) This day he 's come to watch Canada 's leading paleontologist Phil Curry at work. @!Mr-PHIL-CURRY-@1Pa : This one. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : Are these carnivorous, you think, at the bottom? @!Mr-CURRY : No, these ones are all -- these quadrabeetle dinosaurs. @(Footage-of-landsca) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) As Curry analyzes dinosaur tracks, footprints left some 100 million years ago by carnivores and plant eaters alike, when these mountains were mud flats on the edge of a sea. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : They 've backfilled that, have n't they? Have... @!Mr-CURRY : No, they backfilled all this section, which is too bad, because there is another trackway going across the top. @(Footage-of-cliff) @!Mr-CURRY : @(Voiceover) Well, this site, though, is kind of unique because the -- the footprints are actually found right along one cliff face, which extends for miles. And part of the problem is, because the angle on the cliff face, which is in an active coal mine, is so high, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so we lose hundreds of footprints at a time. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : This is sort of our plan ' B. ' This was not the good cliff that we wanted to photograph. @(Footage-of-cliff) @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : @(Voiceover) Phil had seen the site 10 years earlier. And when we -- we flew in, the -- the cliff had fallen in, and we thought, ' Oh, God, what horrible luck. ' We could not believe it. It was just -- some deity, some higher forces conspiring to not get this picture. qwq @( Footage-of-cliff ; - @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) The picture Psihoyos has always wanted is of Curry clinging to the side of a sheer rock face, numbering and measuring the ancient tracks. That will mean both men need to hang over the edge, and that is where John Knoebber comes in. @(Footage-of-Knoebbe) @!Mr-JOHN-KNOEBBER : @(Voiceover) I assist Louis in -- in -- in photography. You know, for -- for many years, I have been s -- a lot of it 's lighting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre ideas. But basically, it 's orchestrating the whole picture. @(Footage-of-Knoebbe) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) John Knoebber is Louis 's longtime partner. @!Mr-KNOEBBER :... sink our stakes right there, two of them, like, 12-feet apart. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : John might come up with a really stupid idea early on, like really insanely stupid, and I 'll say, ' That is wonderful! ' And then he 's like -- he realizes that it 's going to take, like, the next four days to pull it off. And he 's sort of, like, ' Well, maybe we could try ' -- ' No, no, John, that was it. That stupid idea was it. ' @(Footage-of-Knoebbe) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) When National Geographic magazine wanted to illustrate the information capacity of a CD-ROM disk... @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : Ready? @!Mr-KNOEBBER : Yeah. @(Footage-of-Knoebbe) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover)... John suggested placing the equivalent 330,000 sheets of paper in two, 60-foot stacks... @!Mr-BILL-GATES-@1Ch : Well, we 're out here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates perched on top. @(Visual-of-magazine) @!Mr-KNOEBBER : @(Voiceover) So we strung up 330,000 pieces of paper and hung them -- and it was great. It was climbing at its finest. @(Footage-of-Psihoyo) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) And then there was the photo depicting the universe of 500 television channels, with 500 television sets. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : @(Voiceover) It was actually 100 TVs and 100 VCRs that we had programs made of, and then we moved the TVs five times. It was a nightmare -- a log -- a logistical nightmare. @(Footage-of-dinosau) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) And the two-year-long magazine assignment on the world 's paleontologists that resulted in their book, " Hunting Dinosaurs, " a humorous, informative chronicle of their 300,000-mile odyssey that took them to the fossil-rich Gobi Desert in Mongolia, where they photographed dinosaur eggs. @!Mr-KNOEBBER : This -- this egg was just sitting right on top of this mound. It 's an Oviraptor egg. @(Visual-of-Psihoyos) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) And to a museum in Moscow, where it seemed to make sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) This was right when Gorbachev was stepping down, so things were really chaotic. And we got this duckbill, which was about a -- five and a half foot skull... @!Mr-PSIHOYOS :...( Unintelligible) little less. It was a T. rex. @(Visual-of-Psihoyos) @!Mr-KNOEBBER : @(Voiceover)... and -- and -- and -- and for scale we decided to get some ducks. But getting ducks in the middle of winter in Moscow is tough, especially when there 's no food and everyone 's eating them. @(Footage-of-dinosau) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) And to Argentina, to photograph the tiniest dinosaur skull, a mousesaur on the tip of a finger. @(Footage-of-cliff) @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : It does n't look like much in this light, but when the sun comes up and starts radiating across the side of that cliff, it really looks magical. And you have -- it looks like at least three dinosaurs that are crisscrossing tracks, which is -- which is actually much more interesting than a single track. @!Mr-CURRY :... good. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then -- then John can tie me off, OK? @!Mr-CURRY : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-KNOEBBER : Yeah. You -- I 'll be here until you want me to tie you off. So... @!BOWEN : So on this brisk and blustery day, Louis Psihoyos has come to take the photograph that 's eluded him for so many years. Overnight, the weather took a turn for the worse, but that does n't mean a change in plans. And it 's his plans, what he goes through to achieve his point of view, that makes his photography so unusual. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : Just -- just give John a yell whenever you 're ready. @(Footage-of-men-sca) @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : I am -- I am terrified of heights. I can not stand heights. My father died from a fall when I was about eight years old, and I was, you know -- that was like a real big event in my life. @(Voiceover) So there 's, like, in addition to trying to get -- get this picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I 'm OK there. That 's great if you can keep it there. @(Footage-of-Psihoyo) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) So there he was, suspended by ropes, hovering over the snow-dusted dinosaur tracks as Phil Curry worked below, numbering and measuring and moving to give Louis Psihoyos the angle he needed to make just the right picture. @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : Yeah. It 's great. @(Footage-of-Psihoyo) @!Mr-PSIHOYOS :( Footage) That one scene has sort of a lot of things going on it for me. There 's -- it speaks to geology, because you think, well, if -- these are dinosaur tracks, but how did they get like this? It has that ' Indiana Jones ' quality to it, you know, somebody going to great lengths to, you know, get measurements from dinosaur tracks. @(Footage-of-Curry) @!Mr-PSIHOYOS : @(Voiceover) And Phil 's been looking at these tracks for years. Finally he got his measurements today. See -- you -- you -- the spot right behind you. @!Mr-KNOEBBER : What do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : @(Voiceover) So it -- it was good for him, it was good for us. It was spectacular visually. How hard is it going to be to pull me up a little bit more? @(Footage-of-Psihoyo) @!BOWEN : @(Voiceover) Spectacular, every step of the way. The intriguing trail left by massive, lumbering creatures millions of years ago, and the tracks frozen in time once again in the click of a camera eye.
