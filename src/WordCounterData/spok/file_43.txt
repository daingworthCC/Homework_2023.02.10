225741 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : And we are back at 20 minutes before the hour. When the American military learned that Scott O'Grady was indeed alive and hiding in the Bosnian woods, they launched a recovery mission that they 'd been rehearsing for many months. It involved numerous aircraft providing cover and two huge choppers carrying the men who would land in the woods, search for Scott and neutralize the enemy. @!JOHN-ROBERTS-co-h : Joining us now with Captain O'Grady is Lieutenant Martin Wetterauer, the commander of the TRAP Force -- that 's Tactical Recovery of Air Force and Personnel. 1st Lieutenant MARTIN WETTERAUER( Commander, TRAP Platoon, US Marine Corps) : Good morning to you. @!ZAHN : Good morning. @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Good morning. Thank you. @!ZAHN : Nice to have you with us. @!ROBERTS : So it was -- it was early in the morning, sometime after 3:00. The Kearsarge was up and ready to go because you 'd been on standby. @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Right. @!ROBERTS : What happened when you got the call? @!Lt-WETTERAUER : It was 3:00, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And immediately my men ran down to their gear. It 's already staged -- the ammo. And we -- me and the headquarters element, we went and started the planning, the final preparations, which basically all we needed was Captain O'Grady 's position -- his location. @!ROBERTS : What was going through your mind at your time? Were you saying, ' Yeah, we got him... ' @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Yes, I was really... @!ROBERTS :... or were you saying, ' We 've got a job to do. This could be a real dangerous job ; we 're scared. ' @!Lt-WETTERAUER : That, too, but we were really excited that Captain O'Grady was still alive, you know, because it had been six days. And we were really looking forward to getting a chance to go pick him up. @!ZAHN : Did everything go as planned or were there surprises? @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Everything went pretty much as planned, yes. Actually the biggest surprise was that Captain O'Grady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to us. @!ZAHN : And you did n't expect him to be waving a pistol at you all either? @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Oh, no, not really. @!ZAHN : Why did you do that? Intrigue -- you were holding it, but... Captain SCOTT O'GRADY( Retired, Rescued Pilot) : I do n't know -- wait a minute. I did n't wave it at them. No, no. @!ZAHN : You could have been an enemy. @!Capt-O'GRADY : I was -- I was running... @!ROBERTS : Well, you were running -- you were running -- you were running to the Sea Stallion with your.9 millimeter Baretta in your hand. @!Capt-O'GRADY : Yeah, well, the thing wa -- was that I did n't like having the gun the whole time I was out there. But at that point, anybody that would have been a risk to my life, I would have taken it as a threat. So even though, you know, the Marines, though, they were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of anybody. @!ROBERTS : But -- but as Hattie said, in the survival school, the rescue crews are taught that you are the enemy until they do one final... @!Capt-O'GRADY : Right. @!ROBERTS :... security check. @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, there 's also... @!ROBERTS :... so when they see some crazed guy with a beard who 's been living on the ground in Bosnia for a week running at them with a gun... @!Capt-O'GRADY : That 's why I was wearing an orange hat. Only -- only an American would have been out there wearing an orange hat. But the -- the thing is is that, you know, the Marines and the Air Force, we 're all highly trained, but yet we 're also human beings and when the situation dictates, we can go ahead and adjust to it. And the Marines were very directive on telling me what to do. In fact, it was Major Nicholby, the commander of the attack helicopters, that directed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went. @!ZAHN : And at this point that you were getting instructions, Scott, were you fearful that any of the enemy around you could -- could hear this coming through? @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, any time you 're up on the radio for a long period of time, there 's always people out there listening. @!ZAHN : So you tried, obviously, to keep the communication to a minimum? @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, yeah, but there 's a lot of things going on at the time. And the Marines, you know, came in there and were very directive to tell me what to do. @!ROBERTS : Tell us, Lieutenant Wetterauer, if you could, the trip back -- not so much the trip in, but once you picked him up and on the way out. @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Well, we picked him up, we were heading back and -- it felt really good. For about the first 15 minutes everything was going really smooth. Everybody was real excited. @!ZAHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you... @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Well, we had n't been shot at yet. We had -- got shot at about 15 minutes after we left the LZ, approximately. And -- and then things started getting shaken up a little bit, you know? @!ROBERTS : You dove for the deck, as they call it -- treetop level. @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Right. @!ROBERTS : Trying to evade small... @!Lt-WETTERAUER : We were flying pretty much nape of the earth already -- I mean, as close to the trees as possible. The pilots did an incredible job. @!ROBERTS : One of the Marines -- one of the Marines took a spent bullet in the back that came through the... @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Yes. It actually lodged into his canteen and hit the deck. @!ROBERTS : Now -- and that 's fortuitous because he had given you a drink of water when you got on board the aircraft. @!Capt-O'GRADY : Yeah. @!ROBERTS : And he had replaced his canteen. And if he had n't done that... @!Lt-WETTERAUER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualty in that rescue? @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Yes, it cold have. @!ROBERTS : I mean, it 's like skin of your teeth -- the whole thing. @!Capt-O'GRADY : That 's one of the neat things about this whole story is -- and everybody should -- in America should be very proud of -- because it 's our entire armed services. The Marines came in there to rescue me, but it was the Air Force... @!Lt-WETTERAUER : Right. @!Capt-O'GRADY :... the Navy and the Army and all our other national agencies that were part of this rescue. And we should be very proud of them. @!ROBERTS : We 're going to take a quick break here. Sixteen before the hour. @!ZAHN : Thank you. @!ROBERTS : Captain O'Grady, Lieutenant Wetterauer and our audience when CBS THIS MORNING continues. Stay with us. @(Announcements) @!MARK-McEWEN-@1Mete : Vampires will never be the same after the Mel Brooks treatment. Meet one of the movies real funny men, tomorrow right here on CBS THIS MORNING. @!ZAHN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Captain Scott O'Grady and the man in charge of his rescue in Bosnia, Lieutenant Martin Wetterauer. Welcome back. And John 's out in the audience with some fans of both of yours. These women were at our show yesterday and they were back simply because they wanted to meet you two guys. @!ROBERTS : Yeah. These are folks from North Carolina. They are four Marine wives. Good morning to you. Unidentified Woman 1 : Absolutely. @!ROBERTS : Good morning. What did you want to ask Captain O'Grady or Lieutenant Wetterauer this morning? Woman 1 : Actually what I wanted to say was how proud I am of our military from the United States of America. I mean, we are the most wonderful country in the world to live in. And these men and women who serve us are the people of the world -- I mean, they are the people who take care of our world. And we love you for what you do every day of your life. And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here -- I 'm a member of the Havelock Chamber of Commerce, which is where Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point is, and we have, you know, been so proud of our Marines who participated as part of the TRAP team, our carrier pilots. @!ROBERTS : So have -- have you got something that you 've been waiting to ask him ever since you heard about this ordeal? Woman 1 : Absolutely. I just wanted to tell you I am so proud of you. @!ROBERTS : All right. Very good. @!ZAHN : It had -- it had to be very comforting once you got home to -- to see how Americans felt about you. Were you surprised by the reaction? @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, you know, I lived overseas and I do n't get to see much of the news, but you hear about a lot of bad things. I 'll tell you, there are so many good people in this country. All I 've seen is such a great overwhelming response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- are the people. @!ZAHN : What are your concerns as your colleagues get ready to be deployed to Bosnia? I know there are a myriad of them. @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, the whole thing is, you -- you join the military to make a difference. And when you put on this uniform, you know that that 's a possibility. And you swear an oath, and, you know, when you have marching orders, you go out and you carry them out. @!ZAHN : And there 's a slight chance you may end up going back now that you 're in the Reserves... @!Capt-O'GRADY : Sure. @!ZAHN :... if your unit is called back. @!Capt-O'GRADY : I 'm going to be flying as an F-16 fighter pilot for the rest of my career. @!ZAHN : John? @!ROBERTS : OK. We 've got another person here this morning. What would you like to ask either Lieutenant Wetterauer or Captain O'Grady? Unidentified Woman 2 : Just, now that you 're retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually I 'm not retired. I 'm in the Air Force Reserve. And what people do n't understand is that we play a vital role in the military also. And I will be in a combat squadron for the rest of my career. And, you know, Desert Storm, Desert Shield -- even my rescue we had Reserve and Guard units there. Our military has gotten so small now that we 're a part of a whole big team, so I 'm still going to serve my country. @!ROBERTS : Scott, I had -- I had a question actually that -- that was prompted by something that you said in the book about the time that you spent in Korea, where you said that a fighter pilot 's skills are very perishable and that if you do n't go up for a while, you get sometimes a little bit of rust on you... @!Capt-O'GRADY : Sure. @!ROBERTS :... that may impair your decision making or your concentration or something... @!Capt-O'GRADY : Yeah. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will start going back to my unit this week. And I 've got to go through a whole training process to get back up and mission-ready. @!ROBERTS : But, I guess, what it prompted was a -- a question that you had n't been up for a couple of weeks before you went to Bosnia. Did that play into it at all? @!Capt-O'GRADY : No. Only a week is not a problem. But if you go with -- for about a month or two -- like I have over this last six months -- then that 's -- you would n't want to have a doctor do brain surgery on you... @!ROBERTS : Yeah. @!Capt-O'GRADY :... that had n't done it in a while. @!ZAHN : You got that right. What kind of specific changes have been made in -- in policy or in -- in demonstrations that you all do as a result of -- of Captain O'Grady 's situation? @!Lt-WETTERAUER : I do n't know, I think thi -- it 's being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the Marines that are getting ready to do these type of missions now are focusing forward a lot more. You know, training has become a lot more intense, I believe. @!ZAHN : And how many questions are you getting peppered with from -- from many of your colleagues that may end up being deployed? @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, I went around and actually visited units -- survival schools, special forces units... @!ZAHN : Right. @!Capt-O'GRADY :... and life support equipment labs. And we talked about training and we talked about equipment. We 're highly trained and we 're highly equipped, but it 's the people in the military that make it happen. And we can always continue to improve on that. @!ZAHN : John. @!ROBERTS : Got a question back here for you. Unidentified Woman 3 : I 'd like to know how the Marines located you. Where did -- how did they know where you were? @!Capt-O'GRADY : Well, I had a -- I had a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And I transferred my location to him by a -- a GPS, my latitude and longitude. I gave it to him in a code and then he gave it to the rest of the -- the rest of the -- the rest of the rescue forces. @!ROBERTS : You know, the... @!ZAHN : Well, it has been remarkable to be able to spend the hour with the two of you, and as you know, people feel very strongly about what you did for the country. Thank you. @!Capt-O'GRADY : Thank you. @!ZAHN : Good luck with the book. Nine before the hour.
