234941 @!TED-KOPPEL : It 's been a day of massive force applied from the air and the sea and on the ground. A day of great successes for allied forces who suffered relatively few casualties, met very little enemy resistance and took thousands of enemy soldiers prisoner. Tonight we 'll look at this first day of the ground war and assess the reaction in Washington, Baghdad, Riyadh, Moscow and elsewhere around the world @!ANNOUNCER This is an ABC News special, a Gulf war special edition of World News Sunday. Now reporting from Washington, Ted Koppel. @!TED-KOPPEL : Good evening. The first day of the ground war is now all but over and from the point of view of coalition forces, it seems to have been a resounding success. In fact, there appears to be a deliberate effort underway from top theater commanders in Saudi Arabia and from the civilian command authorities here in Washington to keep premature enthusiasm in check. For the moment though, news from the front is almost uniformly good. SHIP GUNFIRE This video shot before dawn out in the Persian Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USS Missouri firing at Iraqi positions in Kuwait. ARTILLERY FIRE Shortly after dawn, these pictures of US Howitzers already inside Iraq firing at enemy troop emplacements inland. TANKS MOVING If there has been any surprise all day long, it has been the incredible speed with which coalition forces have been able to drive into both Kuwait and Iraq itself. And all day long we have been hearing about the near collapse of at least the initial Iraqi defense lines. Enemy prisoners of war being taken by the dozen, by the hundred, by the thousand, until at last word nearly 7,000 have surrendered during this first day alone. And almost miraculously casualties among coalition forces... a relative handful. We begin our report tonight with this wrap-up from Saudi Arabia and ABC 's Bill Redeker. BILL REDEKER : TANKS MOVING The blitzkrieg assault began at dawn, thousands of allied tanks and armored personnel carriers cut through sand berms in southern Kuwait and Iraq, meeting little resistance along the way. ARTILLERY FIRE Army Howitzers fired ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artillery. DAVID HOLLINGSWORTH / US ARMY : We have to go kill people, but that 's the only way we 're getting home. I 'd say it 's either them or me. BILL REDEKER : Allied casualties were light. Eleven Marines were reportedly killed in one counterattack, there were no reports of chemical weapons being used. Britain 's Independent Television News reporter Sandy Gall was at the front. SANDY GALL : An empty Iraqi position and Saudi armor in the Kuwaiti desert. Now they 're moving forward in the direction of Kuwait City. BILL REDEKER : Lightly defended Iraqi positions were easily overrun. Central command said 5,500 frontline Iraqi soldiers were captured during the first ten hours of the battle. IRAQI POW Some of the Iraqis clutched pamphlets air-dropped by the allies instructing them on how to surrender. The Saudi military posed with their prisoners who appeared dazed and in some cases relieved it was over. POW This one kissed one of his captors. SAUDI SOLDIER : We are entering now to Kuwait. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL REDEKER : Correspondent Forrest Sawyer filed the first live television report from near the front. FORREST SAWYER : BERM This is the earth berm that you have heard a great deal about. Really in this great, flat desert it is simply sand that has been pushed up as a protection against the Iraqi troops. Past here we have about five kilometers and then Iraqi fortifications into Kuwait. HOLES Holes have been cut into this earth berm. That is the way that tanks, that armored personnel carriers, that all the equipment that the forces here will begin to launch will be moving toward the Iraqis. I am with Egyptian forces right now, Peter. I have spent some of the day with Saudi forces, there are Kuwaitis here. These are where the Arab allies are placed and it is from here that they will launch their aspect of the battle. I 'm not sure what you 're seeing Peter, I expect it 's some of the artillery fire and there is tremendous enthusiasm that you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND FIRING ARTILLERY If you pause for a second Forrest, we can actually hear them. BILL REDEKER : Light rain and overcast skies further darkened by the smoke of 200 oil well fires made visibility today difficult, complicating close air support provided by Marines and the Air Force. Pilots said all of Kuwait looked like it was on fire. COLONEL HAL HORNBURG : Looks like what I envisioned hell would look like. I hope I never have the opportunity to see firsthand, but the country of Kuwait is burning. LIEUTENANT LOU DEFALTANO : A lot of black smoke up there. It looked like a lot of devastation going on in the ground. BILL REDEKER : In the Gulf off the coast of Kuwait, naval preparations for an amphibious assault. British correspondent Michael Nicholson. MICHAEL NICHOLSON : The sudden arrival here of this battle group with such enormous firepower and so close to the coast is something the Iraqis could never have expected, but at dawn with smoke from the fires along the Kuwaiti coast heavy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. BILL REDEKER : The opening day of the land battle TAPE BLANK But the ground campaign of course has just begun and the allied forces have not yet fought Iraq 's second echelon ; the well-trained, well-armed Republican Guards. As one field commander today said, the farther we go, the more difficult it will become. Ted. @!TED-KOPPEL : Bill, I 'm intrigued by those oil fires still going on. To what degree are they visible in Saudi Arabia now? BILL REDEKER : We 've noticed the overcast conditions here all day. It started out this morning with a little bit of sun, but then it quickly disappeared. It forms a sort of gray pall over the area and of course, it 's been raining today as well. @!TED-KOPPEL : And what about the sense of enthusiasm? I mean one of the impressions that we get back here in Washington is that the civilian command at least, is trying very hard to sort of tamp down a sense of premature victory. BILL REDEKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that through several pool reports that we have read here and part of it of course, is because they have not yet as I mentioned, confronted the Republican Guard which will come further on in this campaign. So I think they 're trying to steel people against the possibility of more casualties in the future. @!TED-KOPPEL : All right, Bill Redeker, thanks very much. In point of fact, we have just received some of the first video of US casualties brought to a Navy hospital somewhere in eastern Saudi Arabia. INJURED For obvious reasons we can not tell you precisely where in Saudi Arabia. The key point here as we look at some of these casualties and you will notice I hope, that none of the faces of these people are visible so indeed members of families will not be getting their first indication of wounded relatives from television. But all of this has been cleared by US censors, so I would assume that the word has already gone back to the family members. But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there have been remarkably few US casualties in this first day of the ground war. Standing by live now at the White House, my colleague Brit Hume. Brit, I gather that the President has just received a late briefing from some of his top people at the Pentagon and I wonder if you could bring us up to speed on that and on the issue of casualties. What more do we know? BRIT HUME : Well Ted, just about two hours ago the entire Bush foreign policy and defense high command joined him here in the residence of the White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Powell gave him a briefing in which he described the progress of the war. He said, " The initial thrust is steady, going according to plan and successful ". The President you wo n't be surprised to learn, said he was gratified at that news and proud of his commanders. It was a fairly sketchy report that we got of what was in that briefing. White House Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the early reports from the battlefield and I suspect that that extends to these astonishing casualty reports as well. @!TED-KOPPEL : Well, I should point out that during the course of the day we have of course been reporting that the number of US casualties during this first day of combat when we talk about casualties, we 're talking about killed in action and wounded in action, were said to be fewer than 20. Was he saying in any specific form that the number is actually higher or just warning as that these first reports may just be preliminary. BRIT HUME : I think what he was really doing Ted was warning us that the first reports across the board, except for the... they know the broad nature of military thrust and they know basically what territory has been covered and what territory has been taken. Battlefield details of the kind that would include full casualty reports are obviously to come later and I do n't think that anybody is really confident in these casualty numbers yet, that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's action and I think that 's really what he was trying to get us to understand. @!TED-KOPPEL : Brit, we have only a couple of seconds left in this segment, but again, the impression that the really difficult times in terms of making decisions for the President are now over. I mean now it 's in the hands of his commanders, right? BRIT HUME : I think that 's true Ted. Obviously the risk exists that casualty rates for example, could go very much higher and change public attitudes on this, but it would seem if this goes anything like it 's going so far that all of the major risks have already been surmounted and it 's a question of waiting for the President. @!TED-KOPPEL : All right Brit, thanks very much. I 'd like to go now to Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia where Sam Donaldson is standing by. Sam, your assessment of what kind of a day it has been and as you give us your assessment also give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression from Secretary Cheney last night that there would n't be a whole lot of it. SAM DONALDSON : Exactly right Ted. Secretary Cheney said last night there would be a 48 hour news blackout and that there would be no briefings and this morning in Riyadh General Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander in Chief, showed up to brief the press, but it 's not hard to figure out why the change of signals. The news was so good it could n't wait. General Schwarzkopf spoke about a dramatic initial success. Here is some of what he had to say. GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF : With the exception of one early afternoon engagement between the Marine task force and an Iraqi armor unit, contact with the enemy can best be characterized as light. Ten hours into this ground offensive more than 5,500 prisoners have been captured and we received reports of many hundreds more north of our positions with white surrender flags. Friendly casualties have been extremely light ; as a matter of fact, remarkably light. So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwarzkopf, can you give us an idea of how long based on what you know now and if things go according to plan, how long would you anticipate this thing is going to last and how do you account for the fact that the opposition has been so light so far? GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF : I would first of all say that the opposition has probably been so light so far because of the excellent job that all of the forces to date have done in preparing the battlefield. With regard to your second question, it 's impossible to say how long it 's going to take @!REPORTER You say the opposition is light. Is this because you have avoided a frontal confrontation with them? Are you going around or over and is that why there 's little opposition? GENERAL NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF : We 're going around, over, through, on top, underneath and any other way it takes. SAM DONALDSON : That last answer was typical Norman Schwarzkopf, the " Stormin Norman " of fable times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must tell you Ted that since General Schwarzkopf spoke in public there have been more sharp engagements we understand, not just the one that he spoke about. But even so, we 're told that he has accelerated the ground campaign timetable. In ten hours ground units reached objectives that it was supposed to take them a day to reach and so he 's told his commanders in Patton-like sense, just keep going. Ted. @!TED-KOPPEL : Sam, I guess the obvious question is why? Why does it seem to be going so much more quickly than they had anticipated? Do you think they deliberately exaggerated the degree of opposition that they would face? SAM DONALDSON : No I do n't think they exaggerated it, I think they were surprised to some extent of how quickly the early Iraqi defenders seem to have folded up, but I think there are four reasons. Schwarzkopf talked about two of them. The air bombardment has been merciless. They 've been pounded from the air now for what, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tactics. Schwarzkopf told me a couple of weeks ago, he said we 're not going to go straight at them where all of those ditches are filled with oil, all those defenses ; we 're going to go around. And as he said in that news conference, we 're going to go over them, we 're going to hit them where they do n't expect us. Then there 's the equipment. Ted, our equipment is simply better than theirs. Our tanks can stand off at 2,000 meters and hit their tanks ; theoretically their tank guns, at least of the T-72s are a little longer range, but they do n't actually work that way. So we can hit them and they ca n't hit us and if I may say finally, it 's clear that the morale and the training of US forces simply are superior. These are war weary Iranian troops, they fought... Iraq troops rather. They fought Iran for eight years and our forces are fresh, well-trained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good news from the front today. Sam Donaldson, thanks very much. I 'd like to go now to our resident military analyst Tony Cordesman, to give us a bit of an overview now. Tony if you would with one of those maps that you have there, of precisely where insofar as we can now describe it, precisely where and how the ground assault has taken place and how you interpret the immediate on the ground military goals. ANTHONY CORDESMAN : Ted, obviously we do not know the precise locations of our forces, but it is I think useful to look at the map. MARKING MAP There are strong indications that we have forces in this area. Marine Corps forces, Syrian and Egyptian forces, Saudi forces driving to isolate the Iraqi forces in this area, move to cut off the major road junctions here and perhaps move toward the liberation of Kuwait City. That is one major thrust. Now we have a very, very heavy corps and by that I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where that is, but one problem with the Iraqi strategy in deployments is that so many of their units, particularly their best units, are now in Kuwait or right on the border. If this force can drive forward, cut them off, move toward Basra, virtually all of Saddam Hussein 's forces become isolated. Off the coast another force we ca n't precisely locate, but the amphibious forces. They could come in, join in the battle for Kuwait City, join in the battle for the key road junctions and they have a great deal of helicopter lift ; we 're not just talking ships. MAP Then if we look at a map with more scale we see somewhere over here and we have no idea where, is the 18th Corps, possibly with all of our light airborne units, heliborne units, plus a stiffening of mechanized forces. And the problem for Iraq is this : that unit can drive toward the main lines along the Euphrates, block any Iraqi supply from coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of the air-land battle are initiative, agility, depth and synchronization. All of those are obvious except the last word, which means we use all of our combat elements together and we seem to be well on the way to achieving all of those four principles in practice. @!TED-KOPPEL : So when the commanders now speak very cautiously as they do of this operation being over in seven to ten days, looks like everything 's on schedule. ANTHONY CORDESMAN : It does indeed, but there is this very careful set of caveats made by Sam and I think we have to reiterate it. They still have substantial armor in place, substantial mechanized divisions and some of their better infantry divisions are not in the forward area. We should not on the basis of a single day go from what seems to be great success to euphoria. TED KOPPLE : Tony Cordesman, thank you. When we come back, the mood in Iraq 's capital on the first day of this ground war. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's successes, members of the Arab world who are sympathetic to Saddam Hussein are denouncing the ground offensive as a premeditated effort to destroy Iraq. ABC 's Bill Blakemore spent this day talking to residents of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. As always, his report was cleared by Iraqi censors. BILL BLAKEMORE : PEOPLE LISTENING TO RADIO This morning people listened as Saddam Hussein told them Iraq was strong and would fight to victory. Then they continued the morning time shopping for basic necessities which has become the routine here since this war began. DAMAGE FTG So far the ground war has made no difference to the general life here in Baghdad. This capital has already had 40 days of bombardment. SU IN RUBBLE Its citizens have grown accustomed to sounds of war. Now they 're listening even more for news from the front, but with the telephone and other communication systems destroyed, such news is very rare and Baghdad Radio gives only general descriptions of battles. There were moments in this city today when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CU BIRD/CU CAT The backyards of Baghdad were quiet with birds and cats and the visits of neighbors. NEIGHBORS Being a Sunday many members of Iraq 's ancient Christian community, which is roughly ten percent of Iraq 's population, went to church. SERVICE Getting out from under the immediate reminders of war for a short time to remember and hope more privately, like these Iraqis who attend the Virgin Mary Caldeon Catholic Church and are proud that they worship using the same Aramaic language spoken by Jesus. As with all families in Iraq there are few among these who do n't have men in the military at the front. While this service got underway, barely noticed down in the courtyard, a Moslem woman came in from the street to pray. CLEANING FACE Unfamiliar with Catholic custom, she performed the ceremonial cleansing more in the Moslem style and then said to the Virgin Mary, " I beg you from woman to woman, make this war end ". Then she bathed her daughter 's face as well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fate of her husband, left. A little later as the service progressed inside three more Moslems came in from the street to pray to the God of the Christians : a grandmother, her daughter and her daughter, whose father is somewhere with the military. LIGHTING CANDLES They brought a handful of candles to light. The grandmother said, " One for my son, the rest for his friends ". The mother told the daughter, " Give Mary a kiss and ask her to send back your father, Hassan ". WOMAN CRYING The only hint they have of what it might be like for him wherever he is was more bombing on Baghdad tonight. NIGHT BOMBING Bill Blakemore, ABC News, in Baghdad. @!TED-KOPPEL : Anti-American feeling was particularly strong today in Jordan where sympathy for Saddam Hussein and the credibility given to Iraq 's propaganda are both strong and widespread. ABC 's John Donvan is in Amman. JOHN DONVAN : PROTEST At first they were angry in Amman. Palestinians and Jordanians cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy. CU SIGN But then the word spread of Iraq 's victory in a war that here sounds nothing like what the rest of the world is told about. Reports of Egyptian troops surrendering by the thousands, Syrian soldiers in mutiny, American troops in defeat and suddenly they were cheering. CHEERING Some of this is street rumor, some Iraqi claims repeated on Jordan Radio. The broadcasts also give the American version, but most people want to believe the US will lose @!MAN You know, Iraq will win the ground battle, of course. A hundred percent he will win this match and we are very proud of him @!MAN Because we will fight and fight and fight and then in the end we will be victors. JOHN DONVAN : TRUCK Today Jordan sent Baghdad another shipment of food donated by ordinary people while at government level, a statement read on television declared Jordan 's, quote, " Anger, pain and condemnation at the start of the ground ". Jordanian officials say the US attacked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBRAHIM IZZEDINE : We still hope that a cease-fire could be arranged to stop the bloodshed. JOHN DONVAN : Criticism of the US was heard elsewhere in the Arab world. MAP Tunisia 's government announced itself deeply disappointed at the ground attack. In Algeria, an opposition politician called it proof that the US had no other goal but to destroy Iraq. Yemen 's Ambassador to the United Nations said, " The ground war was unjustifiable ". And in Syria, a partner in the US led coalition, a radical Palestinian group called on Arab states to cut ties with nations fighting Iraq. Ted, tonight Jordan Radio is reporting another statement from Iraqi radio that American claims from the Gulf war, from the ground battles so far are greatly overexaggerated and not backed up with visual proof, by which they mean pictures. But we must say that pictures out of Saudi Arabia that do exist so far, for example of Iraqi troops surrendering, so far have not appeared on Jordan television. Ted. @!TED-KOPPEL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anger and the anguish in Jordan. What I can not understand is the degree of acceptance of some of that propaganda that you 've been citing because the Jordanians are very sophisticated, they have access not only to, not only access to but watch Israeli television from next door, they listen to Voice of America, they listen to the BBC. Do people really believe what they 're saying? JOHN DONVAN : I think some of them believe it. Part of this is just pure blind faith, it 's also the need to believe and also some of them are pointing back to January 17th, the first day of the war when they recall they went through 24 hours of believing like the rest of the world that Saddam had been finished that first day. It turned out not to be true and that has given them again hope in this situation that in fact there are exaggerations out of the Gulf. @!TED-KOPPEL : Have you had a chance to talk to any of the Jordanian leadership, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street there in your piece, but what about the leadership? JOHN DONVAN : For the time being the Palace, the King, the Crown Prince have been quite difficult to reach. We 've made attempts to talk to them today and so far they have not been available. Officials at somewhat lower level in the government, ministerial level, have been talking and they still seem to be pushing for basically the possibility of a diplomatic solution. They are trying to work on a cease-fire, but you can see in their faces that they more or less know that it 's a lost cause at this point. @!TED-KOPPEL : John Donvan in Amman. Thank you very much. Iraq 's Ambassador to the United Nations is now back in New York, back from Moscow as diplomatic maneuvering continues despite the ground war. We 'll take a look at all of that when we return. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL : Even though all the emphasis today has been on military action, particularly that on the ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic activity. Here 's a report now from ABC 's David Ensor at the United Nations. DAVID ENSOR : ARRIVAL Iraq 's UN Ambassador returned to New York from Moscow under heavy police guard, avoiding all comment. UN EXT At the United Nations earlier an Iraqi diplomat said only that he hoped Iraq 's troops would fight well for the sake of national honor. BAKER But on This Week with David Brinkley, Secretary of State James Baker inched toward supporting the removal of Saddam Hussein from power, saying he believes the 12 resolutions passed by the UN Security Council imply that goal. SECRETARY JAMES BAKER : TWWDB They imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of lot easier if he and his and that leadership were not in power in Iraq. DAVID ENSOR : HUSSEIN If Saddam Hussein does stay in power Baker said, at a minimum an arms embargo may be kept against Iraq. ASPIN House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin suggested how the US and its allies might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LES ASPIN : We will keep some part of, we will control, we the allies, will have some control over some part of Iraq, that part of Iraq which is south of Basra. We will also be controlling the economic sanctions and in particular preventing the export of oil. DAVID ENSOR : POW GROUP The large number of Iraqi troops apparently giving up without a fight suggests to a delighted Kuwaiti UN Ambassador that Saddam Hussein will have trouble holding on after the war. AMBASSADOR MOHAMMED ABULHASAN : Or the sign which I am drawing that not only the region wants to get rid of Saddam Hussein, also his own army and his own people. DAVID ENSOR : SU Iraq 's Ambassador to the United Nations is expected to meet here tomorrow with the President of the Security Council and a diplomat who knows him well, has spoken with him today says he may ask for a special session of the Council. But having authorized the use of force the UN really has no role, no control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its allies just fine. What they want to see next here of course, is a letter of capitulation to the UN promising to obey all 12 of the resolutions. Ted. @!TED-KOPPEL : David you corrected yourself there when you said no role and then no control, but in a sense I think when you misspoke you almost got it right. For the moment does the UN have any role at all? DAVID ENSOR : It 's a talking shop and if the Iraqis ask for a meeting they may get it, but you can be sure that the US and the allies will make sure there are no resolutions or no steps taken here against what stands now, the enforcement of those 12 resolutions. @!TED-KOPPEL : All right, David Ensor at the United Nations. Thanks very much. For the past several days of course the focus of world attention has been in Moscow where the Soviets have been trying to craft or were trying to craft a plan that might have been able to forestall the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then, the Soviets seems to be somewhat on the sidelines. Here 's a late report from ABC 's Jim Laurie. JIM LAURIE : SU The initial reaction here to the land war was one of disappointment that after so much Soviet diplomatic effort it had come to this. Although one official told me tonight the allied offensive looks like a blitzkrieg and that 's good, he said, at least it 'll be over soon. GORBACHEV-AZIZ The Soviet Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said its diplomacy has sought to prevent a land war and save lives. VITALY CHURKIN : INTERPRETER The Soviet Union regrets that a most realistic chance for a peaceful outcome of the conflict without further casualties and destruction has been missed. JIM LAURIE : The Soviets still believe that their round of frantic diplomacy was bearing fruit. A few more days they said and Iraq would have agreed to President Bush 's demands without further bloodshed. USSR TV Soviet television tonight after noting that President Gorbachev 's peacemaking had failed, went on to report the allied offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the war could change dramatically if as in Vietnam many American lives are lost. PEDESTRIANS As to Russian public opinion about President Bush 's action, no polls here, but it appeared evenly divided @!MAN I support President, I support American troops. I really want and hope to win, quickly win @!MAN INTERPRETER I condemn Bush. He 's pushed the limits of the UN mandate. AFter all the efforts of Gorbachev I think Bush had an obligation not to start this military action. JIM LAURIE : What concerns some here is that President Gorbachev 's efforts at last minute peacemaking and President Bush 's rejection may have damaged US-Soviet relations, an outcome no one intended. SU When we talked to two Soviet officials tonight about US-Soviet relations, they simply responded, " We hope that relations have not been damaged ". Another said, " We must put our priority on ties with Washington ". But for now the Soviets are simply going to sit out this war waiting perhaps for another opportunity to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim that at the moment President Gorbachev has got his hands full anyway. I gather there was a fairly huge demonstration outside the Kremlin today and it was an anti-Gorbachev demonstration. JIM LAURIE : The one today was in fact in support of Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, but indeed he does have so many domestic problems here, but he was hoping at least to be seen as the peacemaker, he also in pursuing his diplomacy was pacifying perhaps the hard-liners and the military who have been urging him to not get too close to Washington and to build new bridges in the Middle East where the Soviets hope they 'll have a substantial role after this war is over. @!TED-KOPPEL : In a sense Jim, do you think it 's possible that what they were doing was just laying a paper trail so that after the war is over they can say well, we did everything we could and we were as good a friend to Baghdad as we could have been under the circumstances? JIM LAURIE : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particularly concerned about Arab public opinion, Moslem public opinion if you will. They after all have 50 million Moslems living inside the Soviet Union and so there is a constituency. Some of those people actually support Saddam Hussein, so Mr. Gorbachev has had to be careful. @!TED-KOPPEL : Jim Laurie. Thank you very much. When we return we 'll go back to the front lines of the ground assault against Saddam Hussein. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL : For those of you who may just be joining us, the ground war in the Persian Gulf is nearing the end of its first day and so far at least, it 's been extremely successful. The news from the Kuwaiti theater of operations is almost all good. The land assault began in the predawn darkness as thousands of allied tanks and other armor cut through sand berms in southern Kuwait and Iraq meeting little resistance along the way. To knock out Iraqi tanks and artillery, Army Howitzers fired ahead of the advancing troops. It turned out that Iraqi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last count some 7,000 enemy soldiers have been captured, some of them clutching pamphlets dropped by allied aircraft telling them how to surrender. Perhaps the biggest surprise has been how quickly allied forces have been able to drive north into Kuwait and west into Iraq. ABC 's Linda Pattillo has been with the Second Marine Division for the past 40 days and filed this report on how it fared during this first day of the ground war. LINDA PATTILLO : CONVOY At first light the Second Division Marine frontline forces crossed into the no-man's-land between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. WS TANKS This is the largest force the Marine Corps has deployed side by side on the battlefield since World War II. They are still outnumbered by the Iraqi forces just ahead. SU IN APC We 've just passed that of the no-man's-land and into Kuwait. The regiment divides into three lanes to breech the first Iraqi entrenchment. Speed is essential. EXPLOSION Ahead, combat engineers have already cleared a a safe passageway through the minefield but there is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That is why the Marines call this the killing zone. JET/GUNFIRE Five hours after the assault began, Iraqi soldiers are surrendering by the hundreds. So far the resistance has been less than the Marines expected. WS POW LINE SOLDIER : Is everybody okay? SOLDIER : Yes. LINDA PATTILLO : DAMAGED HUMMV During a break in the fighting one of the Marines in the HUMMV rests at a battalion aid station. SERGEANT LARRY DOZER : Our left wheel axle hit a mine and it blew up the back of the vehicle. It was a scary feeling and I just finished stop shaking a few minutes ago. LINDA PATTILLO : CHOPPER Ahead there are reports of Iraqi tanks and the Marines must still move forward. CAPTAIN SCOTT CAMPELL : So far it seems to have gone pretty well our way, of course, initial indications are sometimes difficult to rely on. SERGEANT FRANK LAYHEM : I thought it 'd be a lot tougher, but then again it 's not over yet either so, I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought. LINDA PATTILLO : ARTILLERY TRUCK Twelve miles into Kuwait, the Second Division Marines set up artillery positions and prepared to hold the ground they have taken so far. Linda Pattillo, ABC News, in Kuwait. @!TED-KOPPEL : When we come back, we 'll get secondhand word of what is happening these days inside Kuwait City now that the land war has begun as I talk live with the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL : And joining me now live in our Washington studios is the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States, a man with whom I 've had many conversations over the past few months. Ambassador Al-Sabah, what have you heard today in particular from and I realize there are those in your Embassy who are in constant touch with people inside Kuwait City. What 's happening in Kuwait City? AMBASSADOR SAUD NASIR AL-SABAH : We have not had any reports coming out of Kuwait City specifically today as you referred Ted, but we have had many reports coming out during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase of brutality against Kuwaiti civilians ; men, women and children. They have been rounding up large numbers of young people taking them, we do n't know where to, thousands of them. They have attempted to execute many of them and have in fact executed many who have been through the brutalities. They 've been tortured by the Iraqis and I think, we believe the whole purpose behind this is to hide any evidence of brutality against the Kuwaitis. But understand the people in Kuwait have been going through this process of terror for the last seven months and we have been trying hard to bring this fact to the world public opinion and to the media and we have seen how the world reacted to when we saw the civilian casualties in Baghdad. We all have the same feeling with regard to civilian casualties, but what was missing really because of Saddam Hussein 's resistance to having anyone go inside Kuwait to show the world what was going on. Soon enough we 're going to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have been subjected to for the last seven months and the extent of damage to the country and the infrastructure. @!TED-KOPPEL : Let 's talk for a moment about the damage to the country, Mr. Ambassador. We have been hearing today and indeed we have seen video of some of these oil fires. We 're hearing about a couple of hundred of these oil wells out of what, a total of about 1,200? AMBASSADOR SAUD NASIR AL-SABAH : Around that figure I believe, yes. I 'm not an oil expert, but I believe around 1,200 there. @!TED-KOPPEL : What is going to happen to these oil wells? Is it possible to restore them at some point in the future or when they are set on fire like this does that destroy them in some fashion for all time? AMBASSADOR SAUD NASIR AL-SABAH : No, no, by all means they will be restored. These oil wells, what is burning now is the oil in excess in the well itself, but not really the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I was told by the experts, I 'm not an expert in this. There are the low pressure and high pressure. The low pressure, they burn and they just go out by themselves, you know, it takes two or three days and they just die down. The high pressure ones are going to need more attention I think by fire fighters. They could go on for weeks until they are tackled by those people and put out. There 's no danger I believe to the reservoir of oil underneath. You know this is the well which is getting out oil in quantities, but there is no danger to the bulk of the oil underneath. @!TED-KOPPEL : Just talk to me very quickly if you would Mr. Ambassador about some of the reports that we have been hearing of public buildings that are either in the process of being blown up or have been blown up already in Kuwait City. AMBASSADOR SAUD NASIR AL-SABAH : I have reports of these Ted, but unconfirmed and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, confirmation on this reports. We 've had reports here that they have blown up the Parliament, the Prime Minister 's office. They have blown up some government departments and a couple of hotels there, four or five hotels they 've blown up, but there is no independent confirmation of this until we can go in and see for ourselves the extent of this. The destruction of the infrastructure of the country 's been going on so I 'm not really surprised that they have resorted as a last resort in blowing up those significant government departments to show the world what they are doing inside the country. @!TED-KOPPEL : Do you have any sense and this will be the last question to you, do you have any sense of how long it 'll be before allied forces are actually in Kuwait City? AMBASSADOR SAUD NASIR AL-SABAH : I have no idea Ted because this is a... this whole operation now is in the hands of the commanders in the field and if anyone claims to have any knowledge other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field themselves, I think will be just speculation. So we have to wait and see exactly how far this operation is going. It 's going well, we know it 's going unexpectedly well and let 's keep our fingers crossed that we will not have too many casualties and that they will achieve their objective with the minimum number of casualties on the side of all the coalition forces. But speculation is dangerous and we have to be very careful in not being overoptimistic. There 's still a long way to go and it will be done. @!TED-KOPPEL : All right. Ambassador Al-Sabah, I thank you very much. Joining us now live from Boston is General Bernard Trainor, who has been serving as a military adviser to ABC News over the course of these past general weeks. General Trainor was a Marine Corps general, also a military writer for the New York Times. General Trainor, give me your assessment of where you think the greatest dangers lie over the next few days. GENERAL BERNARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we had anticipated Ted. There 's clearly been a failure of the strategy of the Iraqis which was basically to delay our forces with a string of defenses and minefields and various obstacles and while they were trying to fight their way through that to hit them with lots of artillery and then to counterattack them with armor. And this has clearly failed. We saw today that the Marines were able to breech the defenses and when the Iraqis came out with their armor they were defeated and I think what the Iraqis failed to understand was the enormous effect of air power upon them. They 've been pounded for 40 days and at this point they really do n't have many options left and in terms of a danger, there is of course the danger of chemical weapons, but I think that 's more psychological than militarily significant. @!TED-KOPPEL : How do you analyze General, the destruction of some of the public buildings in Kuwait City, the destruction of the oil wells and the oil fields? Just sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth? GENERAL BERNARD TRAINOR : It has very little military significance. There is some significance in burning the oil fields, not in terms of ground operations because the smoke rises above the ground, but it does obscure the aviators when they come in for close air support for the troops. So there 's some benefit to them in that sense, but it 's relatively insignificant in a military sense, so one must say it 's out of pure meanness that they 're doing this. @!TED-KOPPEL : General Trainor, thanks very much. When we come back, we 'll hear from Israel. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL : For much of the past week the Israeli government has been sitting on the sidelines watching nervously as one Soviet peace initiative after another made its way from the Soviet capital to Baghdad and then onto Washington. Now the reaction is to the ground offensive which they had been hoping for. Here reporting from Tel Aviv is ABC 's Dean Reynolds. DEAN REYNOLDS : SHAMIR Prime Minister Shamir may have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no hiding the government 's glee over the allied attack on Israel 's enemy Iraq. MEETING The joviality in Jerusalem contrasted sharply with the sullen silence in the occupied territory where 1.7 million Palestinians were again placed under a 24 hour curfew. SOLDIERS The better to keep things quiet said the Israeli Army. STORES But in East Jerusalem where Saddam Hussein is still revered, Palestinians were outspoken in hoping their Iraqi champion will make the allies pay in bodies before the war is over @!MAN He will lose, okay, but I hope that he would send him 20 or 30 thousand coffins back home. DEAN REYNOLDS : Israelis agree that Saddam Hussein still poses a threat and that he and his arsenal must disappear if there is to be peace in the region. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU : Dismantling Saddam 's capacity for aggression I think, or Iraq 's capacity for aggression I think, is another prerequisite for postwar stability. DEAN REYNOLDS : SIREN Last night Iraq fired its 37th SCUD missile at Israel and the feeling here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those missiles with chemical warheads. BRIGADIER GENERAL NACHMAN SHAI : It will be the stage where he will use the last weapons which he still hides somewhere. DEAN REYNOLDS : If that happens, the Israelis say their policy of restraint will come to a screeching halt. SU Finally, the toughness of President Bush has come as a pleasant surprise to Israelis. They frankly did not think he had the stomach for a major war and they are glad to see that they are wrong. Ted. @!TED-KOPPEL : Dean, obviously Israel is also one of the most active and sophisticated listening points in the Middle East. What are they hearing from Radio Baghdad today and how do they analyze what they 're hearing? DEAN REYNOLDS : Well Radio Baghdad went off the air a couple of hours ago as usual and in addition to circulating the usual bombast about Americans telling lies, they suggested that they will invite a group of correspondents to come and see for themselves that the American claims of victories are in fact false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In fact, the Iraqi radio said that it is the Iraqi Army which has captured allied POWs and they hinted that they may display them on state run Iraqi television. @!TED-KOPPEL : No let me see if I understand you correctly. You 're saying that the Iraqis are offering to take or saying that they will take some Western correspondents into occupied Kuwait? DEAN REYNOLDS : They 're saying that they will take correspondents to see for themselves that the American claims are incorrect or false. That presumably would mean Kuwait. @!TED-KOPPEL : Any other word from Israel that you think we need to hear at this point? DEAN REYNOLDS : Well there is concern here or there was concern here that perhaps the ground war might take some attention away from the SCUD missile campaign that the allies have been pursuing in western Iraq, of course there have been 37 SCUDs fired against Israel. But a few hours after the ground war began Ted, Secretary of State Baker called Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy to assure him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western Iraq and we believe that that may have led to Prime Minister Shamir 's saying tonight that he has confidence in the American ability to do away with that threat and he believes that that will make it unnecessary for the Israelis to become involved. @!TED-KOPPEL : Dean Reynolds, thanks very much. Reporting from Tel Aviv. Joining us now live from London is ABC 's chief foreign correspondent Pierre Salinger. Pierre we have been hearing and I just want you to sort of round it out for us if you would, obviously a number of different reports either coming directly from the Iraqis or from some of their Arab friends, suggesting that the picture is a far different one than that which we have been hearing. It 's not a question of putting them on the balance scale of who 's right or who 's wrong, but it 's always interesting to hear what your adversaries are saying. What do you hear? PIERRE SALINGER : You 're right Ted and I will tell you all this with caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something in connection with what was just said to you by Dean Reynolds because it was a very specific thing they said. Last night one of the first things that was announced by foreign forces is they captured the island of Failaka which is near Kuwait City and what the Iraqis said today publicly is that they have not captured the island of Failaka and that foreign press should be sent to Failaka to verify the fact that it is still in the Iraqi hands. But then there 's an additional sentence in their statement say, but that 's very difficult because we 're still controlling that place and the foreign press probably ca n't come here now. However they are having contact with people outside Iraq and telling them other things that they are not announcing publicly and one of the most important things that they are saying, and I say this with a lot of caution because there 's no way to verify this and particularly at a time when Western information is being held down and there 's no way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a bloody battle today 60 kilometers southwest of Kuwait City. @!TED-KOPPEL : Now who is " they " Pierre? PIERRE SALINGER : Excuse me? @!TED-KOPPEL : Who is " they "? PIERRE SALINGER : The Iraqis are saying to friends outside Iraq that there was a bloody battle today in the town Jada Iyat which is 60 kilometers southwest of Kuwait City where they caught allied forces and where they say a bloody battle with a lot of losses of life on both sides, on the Iraqi side and the American side. They did not tell their people exactly the number killed but they said it was a large number. The second thing they told their friends and again this is something they have not announced publicly is that they have taken a number of Egyptian soldiers as prisoners of war in the fighting that has been going on inside Kuwait. And the third thing they said was all these stories about the fact that there is Western forces near or inside Kuwait City are totally false, they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be very difficult for them to take Kuwait City. @!TED-KOPPEL : I should point out Pierre, we have deliberately not reported it on this broadcast tonight precisely because it has not been confirmed, but since you raised it, I should point out that there had been reports during the day, unconfirmed again, of paratroopers who 've actually dropped into the very outskirts of Kuwait City, but again there 's been no confirmation of that. What do you hear about what is still going on inside Kuwait City? PIERRE SALINGER : Well again I can not talk from the standpoint of Western sources because what we have heard is President Mitterrand saying that there is no, we have no Western powers inside Kuwait City. At the same time we heard this morning from the Kuwait news agency that we were inside Kuwait City. I think that probably at the moment Kuwait City is not occupied by Western forces, but it obviously is a major target for us. What the Iraqis are telling their friends outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and are quite a ways from there and will have a great deal of difficulty getting in there. @!TED-KOPPEL : One more quick question Pierre and then I want to go to our Pentagon correspondent Bob Zelnick. When you talk about Iraqis telling their friends, a few months ago it would have been so simple to say of course, they can tell their friends. How? I mean, can they do it by phone, can they do it by homing pigeon at this point? PIERRE SALINGER : It is my understanding that there is a radio system set up between Iraq and Kuwait and northern Africa where they 're getting this information through. And as I say, as I said from the beginning I am telling you this information with caution, not the fact that this information has not been communicated, because I believe that it has been communicated, my caution is to whether or not what they are saying to their friends is true or not. @!TED-KOPPEL : I think that 's clearly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough to stand by, let 's go now to the Pentagon where ABC 's Pentagon correspondent Bob Zelnick is standing by. Bob, again we got that warning from Secretary Cheney yesterday that you were n't going to be publicly briefed. What about privately? Are they passing out any information at all and if so what can you tell us? BOB ZELNICK : Yeah, there 's quite a bit of private information that 's been passed along. Let me start out by trying to clear up some of the issues that Pierre raised. First of all, he 's quite correct, his sources are quite correct there are no allied forces inside Kuwait City. Second of all, the only airborne action so far and it 's a very large airborne action involving the 82nd and 101st and some French airborne forces, has been a drop north of Kuwait City. The purpose was twofold. One to set up a zone that blocked any Iraqi ingress or egress from Kuwait City and the second was to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have and we never got the precise location of the big battle that Pierre was referring to, but it may very well be that his sources are talking about the same action that General Schwarzkopf referred to early this morning that did involve Marines, it did involve tanks, it did involve an armored counterattack by the Iraqis and it was the only substantial area where casualties were inflicted on allied forces today as far as anything that we 've heard. @!TED-KOPPEL : And indeed at one point we have heard of 11 Marines dead in one operation. That may have been the operation, right? BOB ZELNICK : It may very well have been Ted, but apart from that all the resistance has been light. @!TED-KOPPEL : Just a very quick question Bob and if you would a fairly quick answer on the number of casualties. They were talking before about fewer than 20 during the course of this first day, are they still sticking with that? BOB ZELNICK : Yes, I 've heard no different. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentagon and all of them were under 20. The one revision that I have heard now is that reports reaching the Pentagon indicate that there may be as many as 7,500 to 10,000 Iraqi forces captured. @!TED-KOPPEL : Well that 's already a considerable increase over what I mentioned at the top of this broadcast. I spoke of 7,000 now 7,500 to 10,000. Bob Zelnick, thank you. I 'll be back with more in a moment. Commercial break @!TED-KOPPEL : The families of the men and women serving in Operation Desert Storm, the anxiety over whether there would be a ground war is now over, but their anxiety over when and whether their loved ones will be coming home has grown obviously, that much stronger. ABC 's Mark Potter talked to families who were waiting and hoping at Fort Stewart, Georgia. MARK POTTER : DAWN STREET SCENES At dawn Hinesville, Georgia was quiet and on the surface seemed peaceful. But Hinesville is home to Fort Stewart and the Army 's 24th Mechanized Infantry Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet here masks a town that is waiting and worrying. RESTAURANT EXT/INT At a local restaurant the breakfast talk and morning papers focused on the obvious topic. EDWARD Private Edward Napolitano was a member of the 24th who was not sent to the Middle East. He waits now for news of his friends. PRIVATE EDWARD NAPOLITANO : Just kind of wondering what they 're thinking about, you know, what they 're looking at, you know... you know, they 're probably scared. MARK POTTER : Many people in this town have loved ones fighting today. JANE Jane Goodwine 's husband is a tank commander and last night she told her children their father was at war. JANE GOODWINE : They just said, " Mama, is Daddy in war right now? ". I says, the ground war has started and he says, " Well is Daddy in it? " and I says, " Honey, I do n't know ". And I says you know, probably, but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I says, " Of course he 's coming home ". MARK POTTER : BARBARA Barbara Yandow 's husband is in the infantry. Working in a restaurant helps take her mind off some of her fears but only temporarily. BARBARA YANDOW : You ca n't get away from it. Eventually when you go home and it 's nighttime, it hits you. You think about it constantly of what could happen and what your life will be if something does happen. MARK POTTER : SERVICE Many in Hinesville felt war was inevitable, but that has n't made the separations or the waiting any easier. Churches were filled today @!MINISTER And Lord we pray for the unsung heroes today who feel unable to do much that 's heroic, but who stand firm and true ; brave men and women and little children who keep the home fires burning. MARK POTTER : SU Officials at Fort Stewart say they have nearly 1,000 people standing by now to assist the relatives of any area soldiers killed in battle, which only underscores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ABC News, Hinesville, Georgia. @!TED-KOPPEL : ABC News will continue to monitor the Gulf war 24 hours a day bringing you news updates every hour and special coverage as warranted. That 's our report for tonight. I 'm Ted Koppel. Good night.
