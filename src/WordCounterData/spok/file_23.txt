223141 @!KENNETH-BRANAGH-A : Hi, I 'm Kenneth Branagh from Belfast. And good morning, America. CHARLES GIBSON, Host : Get that Northern Ireland plug in there again. It is 30 minutes past the hour. Good to have you back with us, Gibson here. NANCY SNYDERMAN, Host : Snyderman here for Lisa McRee. And fortunately for us, gifted actor-director Kenneth Branagh here. New movie out. KENNETH BRANAGH : Indeed, yes, a new movie which has been directed by Robert Altman from a story by John Grisham called " The Gingerbread Man. " NANCY SNYDERMAN : Yes, look forward to talking to you. CHARLES GIBSON : The last movie you did was written by some other guy... KENNETH BRANAGH : Yes,( inaudible)... CHARLES GIBSON :... Shakespeare, I think was( inaudible). KENNETH BRANAGH : That 's -- yes, that 's it... NANCY SNYDERMAN :( inaudible), that 's right. KENNETH BRANAGH :...( inaudible). CHARLES GIBSON : And he was -- that was four hours. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little shorter. This is a -- yes, this is a more commercial length, we might say. But -- so it 's not four hours, so we 're not asking people to, you know, book the whole day up to go see this one. This is... NANCY SNYDERMAN : Well... KENNETH BRANAGH :... more of a kind of topical movie, I guess. NANCY SNYDERMAN :... we both saw the last one, the four-hour version. And you know what? I was mesmerized. CHARLES GIBSON : Yes. KENNETH BRANAGH : Well, thank you very much,( inaudible). NANCY SNYDERMAN : I was mesmerized. KENNETH BRANAGH : We had a terrific response in this country, actually, and around the world, from people for whom it was something of a -- you know, a good and interesting event to go and see it. CHARLES GIBSON : You sound surprised that the Yanks... NANCY SNYDERMAN : It was extraordinary. CHARLES GIBSON :... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANAGH : Well, no, I mean, I just -- surprised that anyone 's prepared to go to the movies for four hours. But, in fact, people are -- you know, I think audiences are underestimated, you know, they 're up... NANCY SNYDERMAN : I think that 's right. KENNETH BRANAGH :... they 're up for an adventure. CHARLES GIBSON : As you remember... NANCY SNYDERMAN : I think that 's right. CHARLES GIBSON :... Kenneth Branagh 's last movie was the longer version of -- the full version of " Hamlet. " NANCY SNYDERMAN : Which was extraordinary. CHARLES GIBSON : Four hours, then shortened down in some theaters, but now, as he mentions, a popcorn movie that he 's got out. He 'll be with us in just a few moments. Also ahead, when was the last time you enjoyed a -- and I do n't know how to pronounce it, M-A-C-A-Q-U-E. NANCY SNYDERMAN : Ma-COCK? CHARLES GIBSON : Ma-COCK. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television? It 's just one of the unusual primates that Jack Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo, has somehow corralled in our studio this morning, he 'll be here in just a few moments. But first, one more look at the morning 's news, Kevin Newman. KEVIN NEWMAN, ABC News : Right, from the news primate. Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. The United Nations Security Council is going to be meeting again today to discuss the latest challenge from Iraq. For a second day, Iraq has refused to let an American-led team of weapons inspectors do its job. Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler says the team has specific training and expertise and can not be replaced. Well, for years many of America 's gay and lesbian lobby groups have opposed medical authorities who wanted to report patients who have HIV. They felt it was an invasion of privacy. Well, now a significant change of heart from one major group. The story from ABC 's Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) AIDS hotline. How may I help you? ANDERSON COOPER, ABC News :( voice-over) It is a dramatic policy reversal for Gay Men 's Health Crisis, the country 's most prominent AIDS service organization. In a statement to be released today, GMHC is recommending that New York doctors begin reporting all HIV-positive people to the state health department. RONALD JOHNSON, Managing Director, Gay Men 's Health Crisis : We need to know where are the new infections emerging? What communities? Among what groups? ANDERSON COOPER :( voice-over) Currently, in all states doctors must report cases of full-blown AIDS to health officials, but only 28 states require them to report HIV- positive people who do n't yet have AIDS. It 's believed that if New York begins reporting such cases, the rest of the nation will follow, making it easier to track just how widespread the disease really is. RONALD JOHNSON : We need sound public health data upon which we can base sound public health programs to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) To protect patients ' privacy, GMHC is recommending the use of coded identification, in which HIV-positive people 's names would not be recorded. But critics remain fearful that people will be scared away from seeking testing and treatment. JEFFREY REYNOLDS, NY State AIDS Advisory Council : The distrust, I think, of government, distrust, and the wonder of what will happen to that test result, and who will find out, I think is going to be a major deterrent for people who are contemplating whether or not to get an HIV test. ANDERSON COOPER : Today 's report by GMHC does n't rule out the possibility that health officials may one day have to record the names of those with HIV, a proposition that 's likely to be a major point of contention as more and more states are beginning to reassess how they 're handling the AIDS crisis. Anderson Cooper, ABC News, New York. KEVIN NEWMAN : Now here 's Peter Jennings with a look at what 's coming up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, coming up on World News Tonight, we will, of course, have the day 's top story. And tonight, we 're going to have the latest word on stress, not those who cause it, but exactly what it does to your brain and body. There are new ways, and we 'll tell you more about it on World News Tonight. We hope you 'll join us. KEVIN NEWMAN : OK, some interesting results from a new survey on sex and life to share with you. According to " USA Today, " a study of 10,000 adults found that the more educated people are, the less sex they have. And people who work 60 hours a weeks or more are more likely to have sex than those who work fewer hours. Well, the hard-working Spencer Christian is watching the weather in a place that knows it all too well. SPENCER CHRISTIAN : Yes. but right now, right now, I wish I 'd been a first-grade dropout.( @ @ @ @ @ @
