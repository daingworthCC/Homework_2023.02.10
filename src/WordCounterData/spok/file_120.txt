239241 @!MR-LEHRER : Good evening. The U.S. Supreme Court leads the news this Monday. The court ruled states can prevent the removal of life support treatment for comatose patients, and it upheld parental notice for teen-age abortions. We 'll have the details in our News Summary in a moment. Robin. @!MR-MacNeil : After the News Summary, we examine FOCUS - WHOSE RIGHT TO DIE? the day 's big Supreme Court decisions in detail. Kwame Holman backgrounds the Cruzan family 's right to die case. Then we hear from Solicitor General Kenneth Starr and opposing lawyer George Annas, and two doctors, Joanne Lynn, and Mark Siegler. Then Nina Totenberg explains the court 's parental notification rulings. Next we have an Update on the earthquake in Iran UPDATE - AFTERSHOCK, and we close with a Paul Solman report FOCUS - PERISHABLE CLAIM on the environmental claims made to help sell some supermarket products. NEWS SUMMARY @!MR-MacNeil : The Supreme Court today handed down its first ruling ever on the right to die. The case involved a Missouri woman who 's been in an irreversible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed. The State of Missouri though wants to keep her alive. In a 5 to 4 vote, the court ruled against the parents saying there was no clear and convincing proof that their daughter wants to die. After today 's decision, the American Medical Association and Missouri 's Attorney General reacted. @!WILLIAM-WEBSTER-M : The states are going to be given broad latitude in deciding what sorts of procedural safeguards they 're going to build in for patients. Essentially the Supreme Court today said it 's not a federal constitutional issue. It 's up to the states to decide how they 're going to treat patients in these persistent, oblivious states. For Missouri, it means that while you do n't have to have a written document, you do have to have a clear and convincing statement of what you as a patient would want or would not want in the way of medical treatment. @!DR-NANCY-DICKEY-A : The American Medical Association is saddened by this decision because we feel it 's an intrusion into the doctor-patient decision making, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last years have been to try to firm that relationship, to strengthen the ability of the patient and the doctor at the bedside, to make decisions that are best for that individual patient. @!MR-MacNeil : The court handed down two abortion decisions. They upheld an Ohio law which requires that at least one parent or guardian be informed before an abortion, but they struck down a tougher law in Minnesota, which called for notifying both biological parents. The court said that law could result in major trauma to the child. We 'll have more on all of today 's decisions after this News Summary. Jim. @!MR-LEHRER : Nelson Mandela met with Pres. Bush today. Their White House meeting began with a White House ceremony where they differed on the role of violence in ending apartheid in South Africa. @!PRES-BUSH : I call on all elements in South African society to renounce the use of violence and armed struggle, break free from the cycle of repression and violent reaction that breeds nothing but more fear and suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Jr., " Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. " @!NELSON-MANDELA : As long as the government is prepared to talk to maintain channels of communication between itself and the government, there can be no question of violence whatsoever, but when a government decides to ban political organizations of the oppressed, intensifies oppression, and does not allow any free political activity, no matter how peaceful and non-violent, then the people have no alternative but to resort to violence. @!MR-LEHRER : The two men met for more than two hours. Mandela said afterward the discussions were very fruitful. He said there was agreement on most issues and they had narrowed their differences. Mandela announces a joint session of Congress tomorrow. @!MR-MacNeil : China 's two most prominent dissidents were allowed to leave their country today. Physicist Feng Li Jeux and his wife, Li Sro Shen had been living in the U.S. embassy in Beijing last June. They took refuge there after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive in London late tonight. In a statement released today, Feng said he would not take part in any activities whose motive lies in opposing China. The White House called China 's decision " a humanitarian action that will help improve U.S.-Chinese relations. " @!MR-LEHRER : There were more earthquake aftershocks in Iran today. They caused more landslides which blocked roads and slowed down the relief effort. The death toll from Thursday 's quake is now estimated to be at least 50,000. More than 1/2 million of people are believed to have been left homeless. One of the main concerns now is burying the dead quickly to prevent the spread of disease. We 'll have a further update on the earthquake after the News Summary. @!MR-MacNeil : In Poland, a split within the Solidarity movement has widened. Lech Walesa spent yesterday defending himself against long-time supporters at a Solidarity meeting. He was read a letter by 63 leading members of Solidarity challenging him for criticizing the current government 's economic policies and calling for a restructuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editorial saying yesterday 's session was a death certificate for Solidarity unity. That 's our News Summary. Now it 's on to the Supreme Court decisions on right to die and parental notification, and Iranian earthquake, an Iranian earthquake report, and products that claim to protect the environment. FOCUS - TEENAGE ABORTIONS @!MR-MacNeil : The Supreme Court today handed down decisions in two closely watched abortion cases involving parental notification. The decisions are being cheered by anti abortion groups and viewed with dismay by abortion rights activists. To clarify the decisions we have with us Nina Totenberg, Legal Affairs Correspondent for National Public Radio. Nina let 's look at decision one at a time. The Ohio law that the Court upheld. What is at issue and what did they say? @!MS-TOTENBERG : Well Ohio had a law that required any minor to notify or the doctor treating any minor to notify the parents of that minor 24 hours before an intended abortion. And that is a single parent. Not both parents but one parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do that she could go to a judge for a judicial by pass procedure by which she could either prove to the judge she was mature enough to make the decision on her own or that it was in her best interest not to tell her parents and have the abortion. Today the Supreme Court upheld that law as Constitutional. @!MR-MacNeil : By 6 to 3? @!MS-TOTENBERG : By 6 to 3 right. @!MR-MacNeil : Now looking at the Minnesota law. As I understand they partly rejected but partly upheld. @!MS-TOTENBERG : The Minnesota law is fiendishly complicated. The simple part of it is Minnesota passed a law that said both parents have to be notified and in the event Courts strike this down as unconstitutional said the Minnesota Legislature we 've got a back up provision providing for the judicial by pass proceeding where again the minor can go and show that she is either mature enough or that it is in her best interest to have this abortion with out telling both her biological parents. The Minnesota requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both lived with the child, regardless if they ever lived with the child. Well the Supreme Court struck down the two parent notification requirement by a 5 to 4 vote but then Justice O'Connor switched her vote and on the Second 5 to 4 vote upheld the Minnesota statute as long as they had a judicial by pass around it. Justice O'Connor wrote that two parent notification without judicial by pass was unreasonable because half the minors in the State did not live with both biological parents. @!MR-MacNeil : So the bottom line as of tonight in roughly half the American States that have or are considering a parental notification ruling it is now considered constitutional that a requirement that one parent be notified before an abortion? @!MS-TOTENBERG : That is sort of right. The unanswered question is whether a statute would require that one parent be notified without a judicial by pass procedure. The Supreme Court did not answer that question today. It only said with a judicial by pass procedure that a single parent and double parent notification are both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MR-MacNeil : Now both sides as I said a moment ago are interpreting these decisions today as having enormous implications. Kate Michaelman the of the National Rights Abortion League had signaled by her voted today by her opinions today a willingness to overturn Roe versus Wade the 1973 abortion case that made abortion legal. What do you make of that observation? @!MS-TOTENBERG : Well I think that she signaled her disagreement with many parts of Roe. She said very clearly today, however, that there is some right to an abortion. That the state can not put an undo burden on a women 's right to abortion. That she would strike down a law that would pose an undo burden. Now she has said this before and she had never met an undo burden before today. Today she said that a two parent notification without a judicial bypass is an undo burden. We do n't know for example does she think that a state law that would provide criminal penalties to the women that that is an undo burden. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a doctor that provides an abortion is that an undo burden. Does she think that a state law that would provide criminal penalties for the woman in the second trimester would that be an un do burden. There are many unanswered questions but Roe vs. Wade is obviously in deep trouble. @!MR-MacNeil : Both sides of the abortion agreed today that it is in jeopardy. For those who watched Justice O'Connor 's evolution on this issue did you see a further movement in either direction in what she did today? @!MS-TOTENBERG : I ca n't honestly say she did other than she finally met a state regulation that in her view posed an undo burden. She has never met a regulation like that in her years in the Supreme Court, what is it since 1982. She had never met that kind of regulation and she has encountered quite a number of regulations. How ever she did not join the four members of the Court who have said rather clearly that they want to over rule Roe vs. Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he railed at the Court for not taking the abortions issue out of the Courts and putting back in to state legislatures. @!MR-MacNeil : Now am I right in thinking that is what the Bush Administration had asked the Court to do in this case? They want these cases to go further and use it as wider statements against Roe vs. Wade? @!MS-TOTENBERG : That is what the Bush Administration had asked the Court to do whether the Administration thought the Court would use these cases to do that I frankly doubt but they did ask for that. @!MR-MacNeil : When is the next opportunity for the cases pending in which the Court could do that if it chose to. @!MR-MacNeil : There is another abortion case next year testing whether there can be a ban on federal funds on any organization that provides referrals in abortion. That gives information where you can find out about abortion. So that is the next abortion case but any abortion case provides an opportunity. @!MR-MacNeil : But for those on the abortion rights argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened today they are right are n't they that Roe vs. Wade is in more trouble than it was before these decisions? @!MS-TOTENBERG : I think so but I do n't think that it was unanticipated. After all, this law in Minnesota abortion is the only kind of medical procedure for which both biological parents permission is required. If your kid is going to have a tooth out you do n't normally have both parents give their permission. So this law in many ways is far more extreme than the average run of the mill abortion statute and I do n't think any body expected these cases to come out much differently. I do n't think any expected the Court to retrench and say we like Roe vs. Wade after all. @!MR-MacNeil : Nina Totenberg thank you very much for joining us. @!MS-TOTENBERG : Thank you Robin. @!MR-MacNeil : Jim. FOCUS - WHOSE RIGHT TO DIE? @!MR-LEHRER : Now the Supreme Court 's decision on the right to die. The Court today rejected a plea from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding tubes that have kept her alive since 1983. Kwame Holman has a backgrounder on the case. The Case of Nancy Cruzan. @!MR-HOLMAN : Nancy Cruzan has been kept alive by a feeding tube for almost 7 years since she was severely injured in a car accident. As a result of her injuries her heart stopped leaving her brain without oxygen for almost 14 minutes before she was resuscitated. Her doctors say Cruzan 's brain was damaged irreversibly. They say the once energetic women 25 at the time of the accident is permanently in a condition called persistent vegetative state. @!JOYCE-CRUZAN-Moth : She has no dignity. She is completely dependent. She has teeth missing, she has gained so much weight, she was very careful about her weight. She was a very proud person and cute. @!JOE-CRUZAN-Father : It is an artificial treatment and we are not starving Nancy. We are not talking about hamburgers and hot dogs or french fries or cokes. We are talking about a formula that is driven in to her stomach with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen is forced in to the lungs of some one who ca n't breath. @!MR-HOLMAN : Friends told them nancy said if sick or injured she would not want to continue her life unless she could live half way normally. Two years ago the family asked a Missouri Court to allow the feeding tube to be removed to allow nancy Cruzan to die. That Court ruled in the families favor. But the State of Missouri challenged the ruling and the Missouri Supreme Court agreed saying Nancy Cruzan 's statements about her wishes were unreliable for the purpose of establishing her intent. In addition the Missouri Supreme Court failed to see a distinction between withdrawing a feeding tube and withdrawing other kinds of life sustaining treatment. The Court said that it had grave doubts as to the applicability of privacy rights to decision to terminate the provision of food and water to an incompetent patient. @!JOE-CRUZAN : Started to think a lot of about what she would want, you know, if Nancy could come back for just a second and say here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do. And we both, all of us, felt, we came to the same opinion that she would not want to continue living this way. @!MR-LEHRER : Now two legal views of today 's decision. Kenneth Starr is the United States Solicitor General who argued before the court on behalf of the State of Missouri and against the State of Missouri, George Annas teaches law at Boston University 's hospital, he wrote an Amikes Brief in the case and support of the Cruzan family. He joins us tonight from public station KCTA-Minneapolis- St. Paul. Mr. Starr, how important a decision is this from a legal point of view? @!KENNETH-STARR-U.S : Well, I think it is important. It is the first time that the court has spoken to this very sensitive and delicate subject that has come in the popular mind to be known the right to die. So it 's the court 's first chance to address this issue, and then I think this decision, itself, is important by virtue of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the impact will be? How many other cases like this are there in the legal system or potentially in the legal system that this could touch? @!MR-STARR : This is a more frequently recurring situation, Jim. It 's terribly tragic. It is also a tribute to advances in medical technology. It 's a novel issue and the law is just now coming to deal with this very difficult issue in the last decade or two. @!MR-LEHRER : In a couple of sentences, what has the court said? @!MR-STARR : The court has said that this extraordinarily difficult area is one in which state legislators should have the opportunity to legislate, to pass laws, to promulgate regulations, in a way that in the judgment of the state legislature is best situated to this very difficult problem. That is to say, what the court said in a nutshell there is no single solution, that the state should be able to experiment, to try different kinds of approaches in this very difficult area, and specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri to require, since this is a life or death decision, clear and convincing evidence of why Nancy and others in this sad and tragic state would want. @!MR-LEHRER : Mr. Annas, how would you state this decision? @!GEORGE-ANNAS-Medi : Well, I think sad and tragic are pretty good adjectives. I think that Justice Brennan got it right when he said that what happened here is that the court treated Nancy Cruzan as an abstraction, not as a real woman, and tried to deny that she existed and pushed it aside to try to develop some bureaucratic, technical procedural rules that, in effect, made it possible for Nancy to have predicted her condition and to refuse treatment under these circumstances. @!MR-LEHRER : The court said that there had to be some kind of proof or some kind of statement on the record somewhere to show the desire of the patient. You think that 's too strict a test. @!MR-ANNAS : No, I think there should be some -- I have no problem with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the guardian ad litem, both of her parents, and some statements from Nancy, herself, made it pretty clear that she did not want to survive like this. The question is whether you have to elevate that to clear and convincing evidence and some documentation, and I think, as Justice Brennan did, by doing that, you make it impossible. People just do n't do that. People ca n't predict how they 're going to dy and ca n't look ahead to see what medical interventions might be available to prolong their lives at a time when they 're dying of a disease they could n't predict. @!MR-LEHRER : What do you think the impact of this is going to be out in the states? @!MR-ANNAS : Well, I 'm hopeful that the impact will be minimal. Only New York and Missouri have laws like this now. I doubt that people are going to rush to try to enact laws as stringent as Missouri. 88 percent of people in a recent national poll said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state, that the family should be making these decisions, not the state, and I agree with that. @!MR-LEHRER : But you believe the state has a right and duty to make these decisions, is that right? @!MR-STARR : I do not address the duty. What the court said today is that the state should be permitted to develop the procedures that they think are the best, that are the most humane, that are most sensitive to the public policies of that state. The court did not, and I think this is very important, Jim, the court did not ordain a specific procedure that has to be followed. What it said is that the state of Missouri should be permitted as it sees fit to require this very not by any means unknown but stepped up standard of proof because of the nature of the decision. @!MR-LEHRER : Mr. Annas, what 's wrong with that? If the State of Kansas next door or the State of Nebraska next door, or the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should n't each state have the right to do that? @!MR-ANNAS : Well, this is, of course, what the majority of the Supreme Court used to believe in almost every area that we used to think was covered by a right to privacy or right to liberty, that states should make up their own rules for abortion, should make up their own rules for terminating treatment, should make up their own rules for forcing prisoners to take psychotropic medications, et cetera. My own view is that we live in a country, not a collection of states, and that the Constitution was made to protect citizens from the state. It was n't enacted so that citizens could live for the state, so that the state could appropriate Nancy Cruzan 's body and say that we 're going to maintain this body for our own interests regardless of what Nancy Cruzan 's interests were. @!MR-LEHRER : Mr. Starr. @!MR-STARR : Well, I think with all respect that the court did not by any means hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow issue, a very important issue, but a very narrow issue. It is simply saying that this decision is so obviously irrevocable that we must have a high level of certainty that this is what the individual would want. That 's all the court held, that the state can require, if it sees fit to do so, a very high standard of proof before this final, irreparable step is taken. @!MR-LEHRER : All right. Now -- @!MR-ANNAS : Well, it 's irreparable on both sides. The decision to continue to treat her is just as irreparable as the decision not to treat her, and the idea that she ca n't be hurt by being treated against her will and her family 's will is simply an untenable position I think. @!MR-LEHRER : Well, look, let 's get into the discussion now of two physicians who see this issue differently. Dr. Joanne Lynn teaches medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center, where she is also the director of the Division for Aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internist and a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medical School. He 's also the director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics there. He joins us from Chicago. Dr. Lynn, from a medical point of view, is this at least a clarifying decision? @!DR-JOANNE-LYNN-Sp : Well, it 's clarifying, but it 's horrible. The solicitor general makes it sound so benign ; we 're going to let the states make some procedures. It sounds as if maybe, maybe we 'll require that a form be signed, or some little thing like would happen on the way into the hospital. That 's not at all the extent of what 's happened here. They 've allowed Missouri to say that for incompetent persons who have not left absolutely clear and explicit instructions that Missouri may say that the only thing that matters is that they live longer and that as long as we can keep them living longer, we must, even if it means suffering, even if it means travail for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible pain, it does n't matter, Missouri may say that preservation of life is it, and then they can make a procedural standard that guarantees that almost everyone ends up in that category, and if the standard is clear and convincing evidence and Missouri chooses to interpret that fairly narrowly, then you have to be able to forecast how you will be dying and what kinds of medical situations will arise and explicitly speak to those, or you wo n't reach the standard, thereupon physicians and others providing care can be required to torment people for the simple lack of foresight to have been able to predict things that are thoroughly unpredictable. So if states choose to do what Missouri has done, and for that matter, for those living in Missouri right now, this is calamitous. We can no longer offer to try long shot treatments for fear that we 'll be unable to stop them. We 'll no longer be able to tell patients in confidence that you will not be tormented by my machinery, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it succeeds. @!MR-LEHRER : Now why could n't you continue to do that? @!DR-LYNN : Because if they 're incompetent and have not left clear and explicit instructions, clear and convincing evidence, then they will be required to have their life continued because they will not have met the standard. So that unless you have both clear and convincing evidence as to your willingness to forego a life sustaining treatment about the specific treatment that 's at hand, then all that matters in Missouri is that you can sustain life. @!MR-LEHRER : Dr. Siegler, do you see it as, in calamitous terms that Dr. Lynn does? @!DR-MARK-SIEGLER-M : No, I do n't. I respectfully disagree with Joanne on this one. I think that the State of Missouri was trying to address a group of patients who were not terminally ill, who were not able to speak in their own interest because they were mentally impaired, who had simple treatments being offered, in this case a feeding tube, which if it were stopped, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not indicated clearly in advance what their wishes would be. I think for that narrow group of patients, the state was trying to protect their interests and was afraid of potential abuses that could come when third parties made decisions to end life supporting treatment. In that respect, they came up with the clear and convincing standard. It 's not an impossible standard to meet, and, in fact, it 's a standard I would suggest that offers enormous opportunities at the moment for the medical profession, which is to say the opportunity is to begin to deal with patients and with families in advance of these crises to define advance directives or durable powers of attorney for patients that would allow us then to make decisions when someone becomes incompetent. @!MR-LEHRER : Give me an example of how that would work. @!DR-SIEGLER : Well, if you poll the population, you discover that 80 or 90 percent of the people questioned agree with the concept of advance directives. That is saying while they 're competent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves if they become incompetent in the future. At the moment, fewer than 10 percent of people in this country have actually effected or signed living wills or other advance directives. Studies suggest that patients want doctors to initiate these conversations and that they 're prepared to talk with physicians about their wishes. I think this is a great opportunity for medicine and for the public to come together to effect the wishes that the public expresses to have advance directives. An advance directive either signed or noted in the chart and perhaps signed by the physician and the patient would presumably serve to meet Missouri 's test of clear and convincing evidence. @!MR-LEHRER : What 's wrong with that, Dr. Lynn? @!DR-LYNN : I think that Dr. Siegler has made two statements that make it seem much more benign than it is. One is that the implication is that this applies only to persistent vegetative state patients. The court held this to be true for all incompetent persons. The vast majority of us will be incompetent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to Alzheimer 's, due to dementia. This will affect most of us before we die, not just persistent vegetative state patients. And why ca n't we solve it through advance directives? If we were allowed to solve it through advance directives by in general granting to another person the authority to make decisions for us, that would be probably at least effective for a fair percentage of us who have fairly intact families and available friends at the time when this arises, but that would certainly not meet the Missouri standard or the O'Connor standard in New York. Neither would the living wills. There are 5 or 10 million living wills signed out there. The living wills are entirely too vague. You must be able to give clear and convincing evidence that you would turn down this treatment in these circumstances, which requires that you be able to forecast what it is that you will come across. So if I 've written very clearly that I do n't want feeding tubes if I 'm like Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I want feeding tubes when I 'm like Estelle Browning in Florida, then very likely in Missouri, they 'd say, wait a minute, she has n't given clear and convincing evidence in this latter circumstance, when she 's old and demented and disabled. She only gave clear and convincing evidence if she was like Nancy Cruzan and had an auto accident. I mean, what this court has done today is to grant to the states the authority to set any standard, no matter how impossible it is to obtain. @!MR-LEHRER : You do n't see it that way, Dr. Siegler? @!DR-SIEGLER : No, I do n't think that the Supreme Court -- I agree with Mr. Starr on this -- the Supreme Court did n't specify the details by which clear and convincing evidence would be reached, although it did take pains to indicate five or six reasons why it thought that clear and convincing standards might protect the interest of patients. Among those points that the court made were that it wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exactly the same as the wishes expressed by his surrogate at the time that the person became unable to express his or her own wishes. Secondly, the court wanted to protect against surrogates who might have a conflict of interest. They said that surely was n't the case with the Cruzan parents in this situation, but there might be others in which surrogates would not be speaking necessarily to the best interest of the person. And thirdly, among their reasons they indicated that in any risk-benefit calculation, they thought the risk should be placed on those who wanted to discontinue life support to allow someone to die, rather than on the other side. These seem like reasonable observations, and I think we can craft policies by which people can state clearly in advance what sorts of treatment they would want under a number of circumstances. There is such a proposal called the medical directive developed by two physicians, the Emanuels in Boston, that actually offers possibilities of specification among treatments and among medical conditions. @!MR-LEHRER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, from a legal standpoint, you could set in these directives that would cover and abide by this decision today? @!MR-ANNAS : Yes, you certainly could. I think that Dr. Lynn 's point is well made, that no matter how much and how detailed you draft these, most people simply are not going to fill them out, are not going to have access to them, and just are n't going to get around to doing them, and that does n't mean, as Missouri seems to say it does, that therefore, they want everything done no matter what, whether they 're in a permanent coma or whatever their condition is. The big issue, O'Connor got a good point when she talked about the durable power of attorneys, which I think are better, they 've got their limitations as well, but by naming a close friend or a near relative to make decisions for you, you at least do n't have to predict how you 're going to die, you just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf consistent with your own values. And that is a good thing and I certainly endorse that. And Justice O'Connor came very close to saying she thought that would be constitutionally required, the states could not outlaw durable powers of attorney and could not honor them. @!MR-LEHRER : Mr. Starr, beginning with you, there was a neighbor of the Cruzan family in Carterville, Missouri, who talked to reporters today and he said, " I think the Supreme Court 's decision would be different if each of those Justices walked a mile in Joe and Joyce Cruzan 's shoe 's, " the mother and father. Just from a personal point of view, how do you assess the effect this is going to have on them? Forget the broader implications for a moment. @!MR-STARR : I think the court was clear that it recognized how tragic this situation is. This is not an uncaring, unfeeling opinion by the court. I think they full well understood the human dimension of this. Their point was, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason. The court said that a state can proceed in this area as it sees fit as long as it 's conducting itself in a reasonable fashion. It 's not that anything goes. The rules and regulations that guide this area must be reasonable ones. And for the reasons that the court has set forth, Missouri 's approach was deemed to be reasonable in light of these particular circumstances. Now it is not, the court did not say, nor has Missouri, that there is one specific way that must, in fact, be followed here. @!MR-LEHRER : Dr. Lynn, are you saying that the state, whether it 's the State of Missouri, the State of Minnesota, the State of Kansas, or whatever, should have no say so in this, that it should be a decision strictly between a doctor and parents in the case of the Cruzan family? @!DR-LYNN : No, but I think there is no evidence that it is not enough to have a decision between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there be a layer of review that is possible in circumstances in which there is a history of abuse, which there certainly is not in this sort of circumstance, but there might be if with a particular population has a history of being abused. There 's a requirement that all health care providers report the possibility of abuse, which would also get it into the courts and under review, and then if anyone ever did do an action that led to death that was because of a conflict of interest or any of these other things people are worried about, then there are terrible sanctions that are linked to the criminal justice system. So it 's not that there should be nothing. It 's just that the usual decisions, remember, most of us will die of an illness that we know for at least for at least two years. We will make myriad decisions that affect how we die, many of which have an effect upon how we will die in terms of its timing, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made solely to make you live longer. That would guarantee many many older people a great deal of torment. Instead, they have to be made so that your future is the very best it can be. And sometimes one has to trade off length of life versus comfort, or length of life versus the ability to maintain the awareness of family and friends. And those things can be negotiated much more effectively in the small group of people who know and care and love and cherish this person. And only when what they propose to do is something that might outrage the community, might seriously disadvantage the person, then there should be some level of review, either prospective, or with the serious sanctions of having it happen retrospectively. There is at present no evidence that this private decision making is going awry in any serious numbers. @!MR-LEHRER : Dr. Siegler, let me ask you as a physician the simple question, what purpose is being served by keeping Nancy Cruzan alive, just from a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that Nancy Cruzan 's case is a tragic situation, and I do n't find that there is a great purpose served in keeping her alive. I think, unfortunately, Nancy has come to represent an issue that the Supreme Court chose to address as did the Missouri Supreme Court, and the issue has to do with the protection of incompetent and vulnerable people of whom she is a member of that general class. I think what the Supreme Court today is that not every human tragedy will find its solution in discovering new constitutional rights that may have wide, embracing possibilities, but rather that the states are legitimate laboratories to search for these answers. I think the states have done a remarkable job in the last 15 years. @!MR-LEHRER : But what about Dr. Lynn 's point, which is essentially, I paraphrase Dr. Lynn, that while there may be a reason to protect against people with a vested interest, or evil people in these kinds of cases, that was n't an issue in the Cruzan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Lynn, that the Supreme Court and the State of Missouri have created a preventative measure that was n't necessary in the Cruzan case. And do you disagree with that, Dr. Siegler, do you think that the Cruzan case required this kind of decision? @!DR-SIEGLER : No, I do n't think so. I think the court might have gone either way and it probably is going to go 5/4, one way or the other. I think electing to go the way it did suggests that its concerns are not for patients who have loving families of the kind that Nancy Cruzan, but perhaps other patients for whom advance guidance is not as clear as it was even in this case where it was not entirely clear, and for whom there are not loving families to make these substitute decisions. I think the court was trying to protect classes of patients in the future, and so for that matter do I think the Missouri Supreme Court was trying to do so. I agree with Dr. Lynn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among physicians and families and with patients whenever possible. In fact, the court acknowledged the right of competent patients to make these decisions without any encumbrance. @!MR-LEHRER : Mr. Annas, do you agree with Dr. Lynn that there are other procedures that could be created short of what Missouri has done? @!MR-ANNAS : Well, the major procedures are a combination living will and durable power of attorney since what Missouri insists on and the Supreme Court insists on is that you only do what the person tells you to do in terms of withdrawing. The irony and the asymmetry is that you do n't care what the person wants when you start the procedure, when you start the tube feeding, when you start the resuscitation, when you start the mechanical ventilator, and so you have a very strange situation in this country now, a country where 40 million people do n't even have health insurance, where you have a state now insisting that for its own view of individual, its own view of human life, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, while at the same time, it does n't have to provide treatment to people who desperately want it, and we let them say that in the name of this unqualified interest in human life. I think it 's the height of hypocrisy, myself. @!MR-LEHRER : Does the term " forced treatment " mean anything to you in this context, Mr. Starr? @!MR-STARR : Yes, indeed. The court today noted the tradition in our law that individuals are free to resist treatment, to say, no, I do not want treatment. The difficulty arises where the patient can not, as in Nancy 's case, speak for herself. When that happens, what are the procedures to be in place, if any procedures, to assure that there are no abuses. This family is obviously suffering under a very tragic set of circumstances. @!MR-LEHRER : And with no evidence of an abuse, right? @!MR-STARR : Absolutely. The court was very clear that this is, from everything that appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their daughter, and it 's a quite poignant opinion, not that this is the only way that a state could have decided this, but that the state which is concerned about life and about preventing abuses and to make sure that this is what the individual, herself, would have wanted, can require, clear and convincing evidence of that. @!MR-LEHRER : Well, Dr. Lynn, gentlemen, thank you all four very much. Robin. @!MR-MacNeil : Still to come on the Newshour tonight, an update on the Iranian earthquake and environmental claims in the supermarket. UPDATE - AFTERSHOCK @!MR-LEHRER : Next tonight an update on the Iran earthquake. Authorities now say 50,000 people died in the Thursday morning quake. Another 500,000 are homeless. We have a report narrated by Nicholas Glass of Independent Television News. @!MR-GLASS : There have been smaller tremors, aftershocks, every few hours. In the devastated provinces, one in eight are homeless, some 1/2 million people. Iranians have appealed for more tents. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of Iranian inefficiency. They describe the relief operation as large scale, rapid, and coordinated. Iran has had to adapt to tragedy, two earthquakes, floods, and the Gulf War in the last 12 years. In a predominantly mountainous region, the military has been used extensively, 6,000 workers from the Iranian Red Crescent are leading the relief work with help from the small international contingent. @!VAHE-PETROSSIAN-M : If any nation is well equipped to deal with this earthquake, it is Iran. In the short-term, therefore, in terms of dealing with the immediate after effects of the earthquake, I think the Iranians will cope probably rather well. It is only in the long-term in trying to rebuild that region that the real problems will arise for Iran, because they will require a great deal of money, which Iran does not really have. @!MR-GLASS : This then will be another drain on the Iranian economy. It 's compounded by the fact that the devastated region is an important food producing area. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or really the rice basket of Iran and to have the harvest disrupted in the way it might be will be a short-term blow. There 's another context though you 've got to take account of which is that this is yet another economic blow at a time when the country is reeling from many others, low oil prices, low volumes of oil exports, a great difficulty in getting in foreign exchange, low volumes of non-oil exports. The list is almost endless and for the government now to have to turn to yet another internal piece of reconstruction and devastation is really very exasperating for them. @!MR-GLASS : At Tehran Airport, relief supplies from abroad continue to arrive by the plane load. Yesterday alone there were 68 flights. Only eight from Israel and South Africa is unacceptable, at least to Pres. Rafsanjani and the pragmatists. But the radicals have attacked his decision to let an American relief plane in. Today Tehran Times, a Rafsanjani mouthpiece, carries an editorial saying the Iranian government should welcome all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Yomori Islami, carries a scathing attack on the United States. It says, " Even under the rubble, our people chant ' Death to America ' and pray to almighty God to cut off the American hand -- even the hand stretched out to help. " @!KEITH-McLACHLAN-S : Rafsanjani, the president, and the minister of foreign affairs, and many others like that with an open view to the West will seize on this I think as an opportunity to show that doing business with the West pays, can bring in lots of very helpful technology, even personnel, without in any way taking off Iran its sense of evolution and independence. @!MR-LEHRER : So far, two American planes have brought supplies to Iran. An America Cares plane landed yesterday with 42 tons of relief material. A Red Cross charter brought in $250,000 worth of U.S. government supplies today. FOCUS - PERISHABLE CLAIM @!MR-MacNeil : We close tonight with a look at products that are advertised as good for the environment. Last November, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation into such claims and recently filed suits against one company for false advertising. Our Business Correspondent Paul Solman has this report on companies who call their plastic products biodegradable. SCENE FROM MOVIE @!MR-SOLMAN : In this 1967 film classic, " The Graduate ", Dustin Hoffman wound up heating the siren song of Mrs. Robinson not Mr. Plastics. But the industry thrived nonetheless. Today plastics are made into every manner of product and packaging, almost 21 million tons a year. Most of it ends up in a landfill or littering our roadsides and waterfronts and the flow never stops. Recycling and other strategies can help reduce the flow, but the solid waste disposal problem is a crisis just waiting to happen. Two years ago, Archer-Daniels-Midland, a larger agribusiness firm, went to Britain and bought world rights to a technology to help solve the problem. ADM COMMERCIAL @!MR-SOLMAN : The special additive looked like another miracle of modern technology. All a disposable plastics manufacturer had to do, according to ADM, was mix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a set time period, presumably when the plastic had become garbage, the pellets would kick in and begin accelerating the natural processes of degradation. When Bob Chickering, president of American Enviro Products, heard about cornstarch technology, he thought it was the best idea since, oh, disposable diapers. He signed on immediately and last July began shipping a new line of Bunnies. BUNNIES COMMERCIAL @!BOB-CHICKERING-Bu : Biodegrading is nature 's way of dealing with waste. It always has been nature 's way of dealing with waste, so why if we had the technology, would n't we make something degrade? @!MR-SOLMAN : Also aboard the bandwagon was Hal Stein, president of North American Plastics. He came out with a new line of biodegradable garbage bags, brand name Envirogard. @!HAL-STEIN-Envirog : At the time we first started experimenting with this, no one else had a trash bag that was made out of biodegradable material and we felt there was a niche market for it. We did n't know how big it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought, to be honest with you, that we only had a window of opportunity, and we really thought that everybody else would get into it. @!MR-SOLMAN : Hal Stein turns out to have been right. Environmentalism has become good business and big business as well. Glad Trash Bags, safe for the environment ; Green Forest Bathroom Tissue, helping preserve our forests. Look, we 've all become increasingly susceptible to such pitches. If they 're true, everyone benefits, and if some seem a little misleading, we consumers will supposedly weigh the facts and eventually refuse to buy the offending brands. After all, this is the age of deregulation. The last thing we seem to want is more government bureaucracy to regulate our ads. But, remember, in a capitalist society like ours, companies are supposed to pursue their self-interest, and that often colors both their presentation and their perception of the so-called " facts ". For example, take the case of the wondrous cornstarch pellets. They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the business of selling corn. ADM FILM @!MR-SOLMAN : Not surprisingly, Glad and Hefty, makes of photodegradable plastics, are n't all that crazy about the competition 's biodegradable plastics. @!PATRICK-O'BRIEN-G : My company 's position is that biodegradable additives offer no functional benefit for materials that are destined to be landfilled, recycled or incinerated. @!ROBERT-BARRETT-He : We do not believe in biodegradability, as Jeanie said, and we 've said that consistently since the first day that we came to that conclusion. @!MR-SOLMAN : Of course, the most vigorous skepticism about claims of biodegradability comes from the environmental movement. @!CRAIG-MERRILEES-N : This trash bag here says that it 's made from a special additive that will biodegrade in the soil and photodegrade in the sun. Well, I think again, that has been substantially disproved. @!MR-SOLMAN : At this Washington press conference, the National Toxics Campaign blasted all claims of degradability for disposable plastics and last December, the Environmental Defense Fund called for a boycott, but even they had a vested interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had been promoting for years. Richard Denison is a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. @!RICHARD-DENISON-E : I think it is especially important to make sure that if we do introduce degradable plastics, they do not interfere with our attempts to reduce and to recycle plastic wastes. Those are the options of first resort, and degradable plastics are currently interfering with both of those preferred approaches. @!MR-SOLMAN : Denison certainly sounds convincing, but then so does just about everybody else in this complicated, technical debate where evidence wo n't be in for decades. Just listen. @!RICHARD-DENISON : There are no studies that indicate that degradable plastics will degrade at a rate that helps us in terms of solid waste management. @!BOB-CHICKERING-Bu : Our research is long, it 's sound. It 's reconfirmed itself for many times from many countries, West Germany, England, Japan, Sweden, the United States. @!RICHARD-DENISON : As a plastic material degrades, it may release toxic materials into the compost. @!BOB-CHICKERING-Bu : We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no cadmium, no lead, no zinc in the product. @!RICHARD-DENISON : A number of companies that have been starting to try to recycle film plastics, plastic bags, for example, have run into major problems when they have tried to recycle a mixture of degradable and non-degradable film plastic. @!BOB-CHICKERING-Bu : These are actually our Bunny Bags that have been recycled back into pellets so they can now be made into biodegradable garbage bags or other biodegradable plastic elements. @!MR-SOLMAN : So what are we to make of all this? With no independent authority to mediate, how 's a consumer to know? We did, however, find one scientist to help clarify the issue. We 're obliged to say he was hired by ADM, the cornstarch people, but Prof. Larry Swanson seemed independent enough to us. Swanson 's research shows that the cornstarch technology works best when the plastic is exposed to the elements, as on a beach or roadside, and that it degrades more slowly in compost, more slowly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornstarch works, but is the process actually biodegradation, as advertised? Even Prof. Swanson is n't really sure. @!LARRY-SWANSON-Sta : Every now and then you might hear the word biodegradation in the context of the research that we 're doing, and clearly, we still think of it as being a degradation process or a physical deterioration of the product. @!MR-SOLMAN : Producer Mike Joseloff asked why the distinction is so important. @!MR-SWANSON : Well, the importance of it is that with physical degradation the material 's just breaking into smaller and smaller pieces. If it biodegrades, presumably, it is going to become perhaps part of the food chain and then return back to the earth, and so far, our research has not indicated that the end product will allow that. @!MR-SOLMAN : So after all this, it 's not clear that biodegradable plastic will ever degrade enough to help solve the plastics disposal problem. On the other hand, it 's not clear that it wo n't. Even talking to the professor, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to The Graduate 23 years. SCENE FROM " THE GRADUATE " @!MR-SOLMAN : Recently, a task for of attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission have been asking that same question of the environmentally friendly plastics manufacturers trying to clarify the claims that now abound in the marketplace. And if this story has a punchline, it 's that we consumers ca n't possibly evaluate these claims without the government 's help. Regulation may be inefficient, sometimes even unfair, but who besides government can afford to sort through the well financed claims of the various interested parties? In fact, at the moment, almost all the parties to this dispute agree that only government can define terms like biodegradable. The plastics industry agrees, so do the environmentalists, so does the maker of Envirogard Trash Bags, Hal Stein. @!HAL-STEIN-Envirog : We 're asking today for definitions. In other words, what can we say on the packet because we think the process works and we want to go along with whatever the FTC or whoever says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Of course, Hal Stein, like all the parties to this controversy, supports government regulations now before they have been written. If, however, the official definition of biodegradable winds up excluding his product, Envirogard, or Bob Chickering 's " Bunnies ", you can bet they 'll be denouncing the arbitrariness, the waste, the red tape of regulation, like so many other businessmen whose voices have boosted the deregulation movement of recent years. RECAP @!MR-MacNeil : Once again, Monday 's main stories, the Supreme Court ruled that states can prevent the removal of life sustaining treatment for comatose patients. In a separate decision, the Justices upheld a law requiring that at least one parent be notified when a minor is seeking an abortion. Good night, Jim. @!MR-LEHRER : Good night, Robin. We 'll see you tomorrow night with full coverage of Nelson Mandela 's speech to Congress. I 'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
