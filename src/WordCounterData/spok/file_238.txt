5000141 @5OC@7 Welcome back to " GMA, " with a very excited audience here in our studio. And we 've got two great guests who are joining us. And if there 's a first couple of country music, these two, they are it. They are both Grammy-winning artists and they 've also been volunteers with Habitat For Humanity for years. Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks are joining us from Indiana, where they 're helping build homes. Welcome, Trisha and welcome Garth. Hey, you guys. @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 : Good morning. @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : How are you guys? @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 So you, you guys are out there, you 're helping build homes for Habitat For Humanity. Who, who 's better with the power tools?( Inaudible-technical). @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 :( Inaudible, technical). @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 We 've all known about President Carter 's work with Habitat For Humanity. How did you all get hooked up? @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : We got hooked up through Karen Haycox, through the Teammates For Kids Foundation, I think the all-star, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her work with those athletes down there, athletes we were fortunate enough to have on the Foundation at the time. And just the marriage got started. Then Trisha and I went down to swing a hammer. And just fell in love with it. @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 : In New Orleans after Katrina. Yeah, about 10 years ago. So we 've been building with the Carters ever since. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 That 's a lot of houses. That 's great work. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Yeah, that 's awesome work on, on, from you two. And, Garth, you also made a big announcement that you 're doing something down in South Bend, Indiana, that has never been done before. What is that? @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : Well, they, they opened up the house that Rockne built for concerts. We were lucky enough to be the inaugural concert there so we 're gon na try and rock the house that Rockne built, you know. So this is gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it, you never try, you actually always do it, man. So we know it 's gon na be a great show for those fans out there, without a doubt. And you also, Garth, you also surprised your fans with a new triple live album. And, Trisha, you, you said, and Trisha said it 's the best album she 's ever heard or the best-sounding record you 've ever heard. Is that true, Trisha? @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 : Yeah, yeah, I have to say, I mean, a live album is, if it does its job well, makes you feel like you were at the show. And having been on this tour for the last three and a half years, I was there every night and saw that show. And I think if you did n't get a chance to see it live, the album really captures it. And I, I think that 's not easy to do. So to, to, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, so to be able to capture that on a record is pretty great. And so I 'm, I 'm a fan. I 'll say it ' cause he wo n't say it. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Now, Trisha, you @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : That 's very sweet. My favorite thing about it is @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Go ahead. @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : Go ahead. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Oh, we got a standoff here. So I 'll go ahead with a question right @1GARTH-BROOKS-SINGER@3 : Yeah, my favorite thing about it is, okay, you go ahead. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Trisha, I hear you 're going back to the studio after being on the road. @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 : Yeah, I 'm in, I 'm in the studio right now working on new music and I am trying to do, kind of doing all the things that I did n't get done when I was on the tour, which is wonderful. So working on new music and still doing the cooking show and so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @5OC@6 Any chance there might be another duet in your future, for the both of you? @1TRISHA-YEARWOOD-SIN@3 : It 's possible. It 's always possible. We live together so it could happen. @1CECILIA-VEGA-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 You heard it here first. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Well, I got ta say, you guys continue to do the amazing work that you 're doing.
