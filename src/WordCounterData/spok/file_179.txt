4072641 KATHIE LEE @!GIFFORD, co-host : And it 's a very special day for you, is n't it, Hoda? @!HODA-KOTB-co-host : It is. It is my niece 's birthday. So, Hannah, happy third birthday. @!GIFFORD : Third birthday. @!KOTB : I 'm coming home for the weekend to see her. @!GIFFORD : Ah, that 's so great. I love how close you are to your family. @!KOTB : Love her. @!GIFFORD : They do n't like you much, but you are crazy about them, are n't you? No, it 's sweet. I love it. @!KOTB : Terrible. @!GIFFORD : Yes. @!KOTB : OK, now... @!GIFFORD : OK, big, big, big doings. @!KOTB : But let me just -- can I just complain for 1/10th of a second, before we get to the Olympics? Because I was so excited to watch Lindsey Vonn ski. @!GIFFORD : Yes. @!KOTB : We went to Broadway, which we 'll talk about. I get home, I quickly go on Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said, Lindsey Vonn wins gold. It did n't say spoiler alert, be careful. @!GIFFORD : Yeah, no warning. No warning. @!KOTB : No, no, it was right in there, and it was one of those moments that you were so glad she won, but you sort of wanted to feel it. @!GIFFORD : You wanted to -- you wanted the buildup, you wanted the drama, the tension. @!KOTB : But that 's OK, because... @!GIFFORD : The Olympic glory. @!KOTB :... what a day, though, for the Americans last night. @!GIFFORD : Yeah, I do n't know how I got through yesterday. I really do n't. Because we went to see " Fela! " by the way, on Broadway, on 49th Street. @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. Yes. @!GIFFORD : At the Eugene O'Neill Theatre. @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD : Really lively. I did n't -- I 'd never heard of this character before. His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... from Nigeria. @!KOTB : Yeah. @!GIFFORD : Lagos, Nigeria. And it all takes place in this nightclub that he -- that he ran. And it 's set... @!KOTB : Set in the ' 70s. And it is -- they make you, just so you know, in the show you actually get up and dance. So that 's part of the scene that happens. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. @!KOTB : And watching that Broadway crowd shake it was quite entertaining, I should say. @!GIFFORD : It -- yeah. Yes, yes. Not everybody in the audience was from Nigeria, that 's for sure. @!KOTB : But you could still shake it. @!GIFFORD : It was an international crowd. @!KOTB : You can still shake it. @!GIFFORD : And it -- well, you know what? Today is their 100th performance, tonight. @!KOTB : Yeah, yeah. @!GIFFORD : So good for them. @!KOTB : Yeah. @!GIFFORD : It was really interesting. @!KOTB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I went home. I had to get in a little workout, because it 's strenuous. We 're all in the Olympics right now, you know. @!KOTB : Yes. @!GIFFORD : And then I had to watch the screener of " Valentine 's Day. " @!KOTB : " Valentine 's Day. " @!GIFFORD : Because Garry Marshall 's on today and I adore him. @!KOTB : Great movie. Uh-huh. @!GIFFORD : I wanted to see his movie. Then I watched the Olympics till about 11:15. I said, What happened to -- I thought it was supposed to be over at 11? So it was... @!KOTB : Well, watching -- Lindsey Vonn was such a buildup, and her release at the end when she finally won gold. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. Yeah. @!KOTB : And it was -- it was a moment. I think we actually have her sound. Let 's listen to what Lindsey said after she won. qwq @( Beginning-of-clip- @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos : Were you surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just, I could n't really contain myself. I 've worked so hard for this. And, you know, to finally be able to stay in the finish, you know, with a gold medal is, it 's so awesome. @!LAUER : Was it joy? Was it relief? What -- how do you put... @!Ms-VONN : Pretty much everything. @(End-of-clip) @!KOTB : It was everything. @!GIFFORD : How does she look so good, sobbing like that? @!KOTB : Oh, she can look good doing anything. @!GIFFORD : You know? She 's sobbing and she still has mascara done and she looks great. @!KOTB : Yeah. Most people -- when I cry, I look contorted and freakish. @!GIFFORD : Oh, oh, I am the ugliest crier you 've ever seen. @!KOTB : It 's so bad. Terrible. @!GIFFORD : If you want to see ugly crying, google my e-movie " Spinning Out of Control. " You would -- it 's the ugliest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right, so Lindsey got a gold, Shani Davis got a gold in the... @!GIFFORD : In the speedskating, in the 1,000 meters. @!KOTB :... in the speed -- that was unbelievable. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. I was n't aware of him before, so that was fun to see. @!KOTB : He 's from the South Side of Chicago. @!GIFFORD : I know, he 's a Chicago boy. @!KOTB : Yeah. I love that. And then Shaun White with that -- there 's Shani Davis. Shaun White with that thing he does. @!GIFFORD : That McSomething. @!KOTB : Whatever... @!GIFFORD : You know, we 're -- I 'm sitting watching it with Frank. @!KOTB : Yeah. @!GIFFORD : And as I told you, it was apparently nine Olympics, and he did every ski event all around the world... @!KOTB : Right, right. @!GIFFORD :... with Bob Beattie, you know, the agony in defeat. @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So he 's sitting there and he 's watching Shaun White, and he goes, What is that? And I said, That 's the halfpipe. He goes, that -- he did n't know it. He said, well, they did n't have that an Olympic sport last time he did it. @!KOTB : They did n't actually have it until I think last Olympics. It was brand-new. @!GIFFORD : Do you know what else they did n't have? @!KOTB : What? @!GIFFORD : My favorite. @!KOTB : What? @!GIFFORD : Curling. @!KOTB : They 've had curling. @!GIFFORD : Not forever. @!KOTB : No. Well, if you guys... @!GIFFORD : No, curling 's one of the newer ones in the last couple of Olympics. @!KOTB : Look at the pants these guys are wearing, you guys. This is a team from Norway. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. @!KOTB : They wore pants. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. @!KOTB : And I was... @!GIFFORD : They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!GIFFORD : Loud mouth something, clothing or something like that. @!KOTB : Our guys have been -- our guys here have been getting in the spirit, trying to keep the floors clean. I do n't know if you 've seen it. But they 're... @!GIFFORD : I know. And they call that an Olympic sport? @!KOTB : That is -- you 've got -- now that 's a 10. And look how shiny the floors are, too. Boys, excellent job. Perfect. You win. @!GIFFORD : I 'm sorry, but can we -- you guys are awesome. @!KOTB : You guys are gold, gold, gold. @!GIFFORD : They also get paid if they 're on camera. But -- we 're on to you guys. @!KOTB : Hundred and ten -- here they come again. @!GIFFORD : Here they come again. @!KOTB : Go, go, go, go, go. One more time, one more time. @!GIFFORD : They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the gold. @!KOTB : If you see them throughout the show, $100, cha-ching, every time. @!GIFFORD : I do n't know, after Conan, what Conan did, can we do that anymore? That 's it, guys. @!KOTB : All right, so Tiger -- you guys, Tiger Woods is speaking. @!GIFFORD : Yes. @!KOTB : Tomorrow. Here 's the deal, though. He says, number one, he 's not going to take questions. There will be a single camera. @!GIFFORD : Right. @!KOTB : It is invited friends and other guests, I guess. @!GIFFORD : And press, certain members of the press whom I suppose are friends and friendly to him. @!KOTB : Well, selected press. And they 're having other press way down in some other room. @!GIFFORD : Watching it on a feed. Mm-hmm. @!KOTB : So he will take no questions, he 'll read a statement. It 's funny, because he had a written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, we 've heard it. @!KOTB : And now he 's going to have a spoken one. @!GIFFORD : Most of the papers I read today, and I read three, only three... @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD :... said that he is going about this, again, all the wrong way. @!KOTB : Yeah, yeah. @!GIFFORD : They 're saying this is not -- this is only going to look like spin, it 's not going to look like true redemption. @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD : True, you know, a mea culpa that they all -- I do n't know what the guy 's got to do... @!KOTB : It 's -- well... @!GIFFORD :... but it 's going to be interesting to see if Elin 's by his side tomorrow. @!KOTB : Going to be there. It sounds like what he 's going to do is make his statement... @!GIFFORD : And go play golf. @!KOTB : The Master -- the Masters are coming up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to keep -- he 'll say I already -- I already made my statement, so he can put that behind him. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. Let me tell you something, though. @!KOTB : That sort of thing. @!GIFFORD : He wo n't -- it 'll never be behind him. @!KOTB : I know. @!GIFFORD : It will be with him and her, unfortunately, and their children, for the rest of their lives. @!KOTB : I think... @!GIFFORD : That 's the culture we live in. It 's called trash for cash. @!KOTB : I think women -- but here 's the thing. I think women are going to continue to dislike him, and I think men will just want to see him play golf. @!GIFFORD : Men want to see him play golf. Frank -- we were watching -- he was seeing something on Sunday and he was saying it 's just not the same without Tiger in the game. @!KOTB : Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD : It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KOTB : Oh, no, it 's another song. @!GIFFORD : Everybody! @!KOTB : Another song. Another song. @!GIFFORD : I ca n't stop myself. @!KOTB : OK, can we go back to the Olympics for one second? @!GIFFORD : No. @!KOTB : All those people were wiping out on that mountain. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. Yeah. It 's -- yeah. @!KOTB : I mean, the number of people who -- I think they had six accidents, crashes. @!GIFFORD : And they were major crashes. @!KOTB : And they were bad crashes. @!GIFFORD : Major crashes. @!KOTB : There was a guy, hang on, Nick***( as spoken) ***Vaccaro, in the Post, he had a -- he had a great line, and it said something like, They walked the razor ' -- here it is : They walked the razor-thin line between careless and carefree. I like that line from Mike Vaccaro. Because you have to be free, but you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch some of these crashes. @!GIFFORD : Oh, my gosh. Yeah. @!KOTB : Oh, those were -- those were tough. @!GIFFORD : Well, I think every Olympics tries to do outdo the last Olympics, and of course they do. @!KOTB : It 's hard to watch some of these. @!GIFFORD : And there 's that kind of competition, as well, between the host countries. @!KOTB : Right. @!GIFFORD : You know. @!KOTB : Yes. They want the fast track. @!GIFFORD : They want the fastest track ever. And of course, all the athletes want to break every kind of world record. @!KOTB : Right, so you want faster and faster. @!GIFFORD : Every kind of world record. So there is -- there are some athletes that do not want the track messed with because they say, no, that 's... @!KOTB : Fast. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. @!KOTB : It seems icy, though, with all that weird... @!GIFFORD : Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions... @!KOTB : Weather conditions, right. @!GIFFORD :... over the last week, so. @!KOTB : OK, you guys, I do n't know if you saw this video, but this is hilarious. @!GIFFORD : I have n't seen it yet. @!KOTB : There was a guy trying to rob a 7-11. And there was this granny just waiting to cash out at the front, and the robber came and she picked up the -- look at her, she picked up the scanner thing and just starts clocking the guy. She does not even care. Look at her. She ca n't reach him, so she waits till he comes around and gets him another time. Look at her. @!GIFFORD : I love her! @!KOTB : And he ran away. He ran -- look at her. @!GIFFORD : That 's -- do not mess with granny. Oh, my gosh. That is hysterical. Does -- she looks like one of those ladies you always see in -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does. @!GIFFORD : You know? They always look like that. @!KOTB : Yes. @!GIFFORD : Maybe she was visiting, she was on a visa. @!KOTB : Maybe she is. @!GIFFORD : Oh, you 're so upset. This... @!KOTB : No one 's bidding on my football. I 'm getting upset. I have 1500 -- what is it, 1525? Offscreen Voice : Fifteen twenty-five. @!KOTB : I think the bidding thing 's broken, I honestly do, because there has n't been a bid since -- in two days. Do n't you think that 's an issue? @!GIFFORD : Imagine that. @!KOTB : OK, go to klgandhoda.com, OK? @!GIFFORD : How many -- how much is this one worth? Voice : You 're at $2,026. @!KOTB : Yours has n't gotten another bid either. I think it 's broken. @!GIFFORD : OK, I 'm going to say a shout out to my friends down there in Ocean Reef. @!KOTB : Ah! @!GIFFORD : Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich people. They 're going to bid on it. No! @!GIFFORD : We just had... @!KOTB : No, no. @!GIFFORD : We just raised $2 million last Saturday night. They have still got some money, let me tell you. I want my friends down there in Ocean Reef. You get Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee and, who 's she, and Frank Gifford, Hall of Fame 1977. OK? @!KOTB : Wait, I know your friends at Ocean Reef, too. OK, I would like you to bid on my football. I 've got Archie Manning, Emmitt Smith, Nene from " The Real Housewives of Atlanta. " @!GIFFORD : OK, enough said. @!KOTB : All right, anyhoo. @!GIFFORD : OK. @!KOTB : All righty then. @!GIFFORD : And our magazine, OK! @!KOTB : Yeah, yeah. @!GIFFORD : Which is an interesting -- I want to read this article. It says " Betrayed by John. " You know, all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article. @!KOTB : Yeah. @!GIFFORD : I mean, I think she should also -- I mean, as bad as I think what he did is... @!KOTB : Uh-huh. @!GIFFORD :... I think it made everybody look at her a little differently. @!KOTB : I think that 's fair to say. @!GIFFORD : If she 's sexual napalm, that 's better than what people have been saying lately. @!KOTB : Yes, yes. @!GIFFORD : Do n't you think? @!KOTB : Yes, I... @!GIFFORD : Nobody has ever called me sexual napalm. @!KOTB : But would John Mayer mess with you? @!GIFFORD : I wish somebody would say your body is a wonderland. It 's... @!KOTB : All right. So wait, what are we saying? @!GIFFORD : That ai n't going to happen. @!KOTB : OK. @!GIFFORD : OK. Is it OK to write on your hand? As Sarah Palin did during the last... @!KOTB : Right. I say... @!GIFFORD : Hoda says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you write, quote, " Do n't write on your hand anymore. Too messy. Buy a notepad, " unquote. @!KOTB : Kathie Lee says, If you 're going to cheat, it 's wrong. But if you 're doing it to remind yourself, it does come in " handy. " ' @!GIFFORD : Handy. @!KOTB : Are n't we cute and funny? All right. @!GIFFORD : Ar, ar, ar. @!KOTB : Hello, birthday boy. @!GIFFORD : Adam, how did your birthday go, buddy? @!KOTB : How was it? @!ADAM : Can I just say, I love my birthday. @!KOTB : You did? @!ADAM : Do you love your birthdays? @!GIFFORD : No. @!KOTB : Unh-unh. @!ADAM : Why not? @!GIFFORD : Because you 're 25. @!KOTB : Yeah, you 'll hate them later. Twenty-four. @!GIFFORD : Twenty-four. @!ADAM : I 'll take 25, it 's all right. @!GIFFORD : I 've been 24 almost three times. @!KOTB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind... @!GIFFORD : It 's not as much fun the third time around. @!KOTB : Stop it. @!ADAM : Fair enough. I want to remind everyone that this auction with the footballs... @!GIFFORD : Yes. @!ADAM :... it runs through noon, 3 PM Eastern on Friday. So we 've got to hope that, you know... @!KOTB : God, one more -- not even a day. @!ADAM : I know. @!KOTB : Oh. @!GIFFORD : It wo n't take my friends in Ocean Reef long. Oh, it 's going to be over -- I bet it 'll be over $10,000 tomorrow. @!KOTB : That 's just mean. @!GIFFORD : Yeah. And I 'm going to count... @!KOTB : I want my friends from the South Side of Chicago to bid on my football. @!GIFFORD : I want the Farmers, the Davidsons and the Goldsteins to penny up. OK. @!ADAM : So Tiger, he sparked a lot of chatter on Facebook. @!KOTB : Yeah. @!GIFFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's willing to speak out, he should be willing to take questions. Otherwise, just issue a statement, which is... @!KOTB : I think that 's what a lot of people think. @!GIFFORD : Which he 's already done. @!KOTB : Which he 's done. @!ADAM : Yeah. @!GIFFORD : I think he does n't want to go into all the sordid details. And you know what? I do n't want him to. All right, coming up -- I want to hear your sordid details, but not his. @!KOTB : Stop it. He, he, he, he. @!GIFFORD : It was a spectacular day for the Americans at the Vancouver Games. @!KOTB : It was terrific. Sara Haines has all the exciting Olympic highlights right after this. She has the gloves on. @!GIFFORD : She 's getting cuter all the time. '
