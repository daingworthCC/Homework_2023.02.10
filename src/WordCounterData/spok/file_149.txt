248941( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!ALAN-COLMES-CO-HO : Tonight on " Hannity &amp; Colmes, " Don Imus gears up for a return to the airwaves, but not everyone is celebrating. McCain goes after Mitt Romney, as conservatives pin the flip-flopper label on Hillary. We 'll play the tapes. And our investigative series, " The Price We Pay, " exposes gang warfare among illegal aliens. All that, plus Ted Turner blames the war in Iraq on FOX, and Rush Limbaugh auctions off a letter from Harry Reid. " Hannity &amp; Colmes " starts right now. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!COLMES : Welcome to " Hannity &amp; Colmes. " We get right to our top story tonight. Don Imus is coming back. According to reports, his radio show will be picked up by WABC here in New York later this year. It is the same station where Sean Hannity does the afternoon show. @!SEAN-HANNITY-CO-H : That 's my flagship show. That 's my flagship station. @!COLMES : Your flagship station... @!HANNITY : That 's correct. @!COLMES : But not everybody is happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people representing two different organizations who still oppose an Imus return. From the National Organization for Women, Sonia Ossorio, and from the National Association of Black Journalists, Eric Deggans. Sonia, let me start with you. Why not give him a second chance? What 's your objection to putting him on the air? @!SONIA-OSSORIO-PRE : It 's not a decision I would have made. @!COLMES : Why not? @!OSSORIO : ABC, we 'll see if it works out for them. @!COLMES : But why not? @!OSSORIO : Because, you know, he 's had 30 years to be on the air. He 's been a bigot and a racist. @!COLMES : He 's not a bigot and a racist. @!OSSORIO : And a misogynist. @!COLMES : He 's a satirist. He 's doing humor. He 's doing satire. He takes pokes at everybody. @!OSSORIO : A lot of people do n't find it humorous anymore. @!COLMES : Do n't listen to him. How about that? @!OSSORIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, this is how the marketplace played out in this situation. CBS and MSNBC just did n't think he was worth it. The marketplace... @!COLMES : Either that or maybe they just buckled to advertising pressure and decided they did n't want to give him -- he never even had a chance on those outlets to determine whether or not the free marketplace would accept him or not. He was let go before that even happened. @!OSSORIO : Either way, that 's the marketplace at work. He was on there for 30 years. @!COLMES : That 's not the marketplace at work. Those are employers... @!OSSORIO : It 's the marketplace at work. @!COLMES :... I think being cowardly and not giving the marketplace a chance to really decide whether they would -- let me find out what -- Eric, you also object for the same reasons that Sonia does? @!ERIC-DEGGANS-NATI : The National Association of Black Journalist feels as if Don Imus was not off of the air long enough. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!COLMES : How long is the right amount of time? @(CROSSTALK) @!DEGGANS : He was basically off for a few months. He negotiated a very lucrative end to his contract with CBS Radio, and now he 's returning to the air essentially without fully apologizing for what he actually did wrong. @!COLMES : Well, first of all, he did apologize. He went on Al Sharpton 's show and apologized. Al Sharpton accepts him back. Jesse Jackson accepts him back. The team that he allegedly insulted -- I would say " satirized " -- they accepted his apology. Why ca n't you? @!DEGGANS : I think Don Imus has n't really apologized for what he 's done wrong. What he did wrong was build a 25- to 30-year broadcasting career on humor that 's racist and that exaggerates stereotypes. @!COLMES : Well, that 's what satire is. But give me an example of... @!DEGGANS : There 's examples going back 15 years, 20 years, where he 's called Gwen Ifill, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning lady. He called another person of color who was an official a quota hire. He 's called Howard Kurtz from the " Washington Post " a " beanie-wearing, hook- nosed Jew. " I mean, he 's used the kind of humor that has been abandoned by other... @(CROSSTALK) @!COLMES : He also goes after people from the South, on Oklahoma, Okies like he is. He goes after everybody. That 's his act. Everybody knew that was his act. They knew that was his act when they hired him. It was in his contract. If they decided to act on letting him go because of those things, he ought to get a warning, which he did n't get, which is why he got a settlement. And, again, what about the free marketplace? If you do n't like that kind of humor, if you do n't find it humorous, do n't tune out. Other people have the opportunity to hear what he 's got to say if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, and if ratings will substantiate his appearance, what 's wrong with that? @!DEGGANS : The way the free marketplace works is that you have to take responsibility for the words that you put out on the airwaves. And basically what happened was that Don Imus put out this message. He put out this 25- to 30-year record, and people responded to it. And they responded by protesting. They went to advertisers and they said, " Do you want to be associated with this message? " And advertisers decided that they did not want to be associated with this message, and eventually CBS Radio and NBC News decided they did not want to be associated with this message, either. @!HANNITY : Did you or the organization ever speak out against Jesse Jackson and Hymietown, when Al Sharpton used the term " Greek Homos, " " white interlopers, " we were building pyramids while the white men were living in caves? They all have radio shows. Have you spoken out against them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the National Association of Black Journalists when Jesse Jackson said what he said. But as a media critic, I 've spoken out against when Jesse Jackson has been mistaken, about diversity levels and cable TV news. I 've spoken out about Al Sharpton when he 's made comments about Jewish people. @!HANNITY : Well, you never said he should be fired. @!DEGGANS : So, you know, I think when we find that news and information programs are being unfair to people of color, then we speak out. @!HANNITY : You know what? @!DEGGANS : And as a media critic, I write about it. @!HANNITY : I want to correct a few things that you said on this program that are false. He did apologize. He apologized repeatedly. He went and he met with these girls. He apologized to them directly. He apologized on Sharpton 's show. He apologized publicly. He 's been off the air, I guess, what, it 's going on six months or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air, it will nearly be a full year that he 's off the air here. What I 'm trying to understand, Eric, when I 'm listening to you, he 's raised money for kids that have sickle cell, that have cancer, African- American kids, Hispanic kids, white kids. You 're just going to judge somebody by a five-second comment that he made with no chance of redemption. I 'm trying to understand why. @!DEGGANS : That 's the mistake that you 're making, is that you 're boiling this down to one comment. This is not about one comment. This is about a 25- to 30-year history of cracking these kind of jokes. @!HANNITY : You keep repeating it, but... @!DEGGANS : He admitted in an interview with " 60 Minutes " that he had a producer on his staff to make n-word jokes. I mean, this is a longstanding history. @!HANNITY : Yeah, but jokes. Jokes. You may not like the humor. @(CROSSTALK) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Should Chris Rock, who says far worse on a regular basis, have you ever come out and demanded that he be taken off the air? @!DEGGANS : First of all, Chris Rock is not news and information person. @!HANNITY : He 's a comedian. @!DEGGANS : Secondly, there 's a difference between when somebody is inside a group and they make a joke about that group and when somebody is outside of a group. If you look at " The Daily Show " and you watch Jon Stewart... @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : Oh, so if you 're inside -- OK. @!DEGGANS :... he makes jokes about being a Jewish man that somebody who 's not Jewish could not make. There 's a difference. @!HANNITY : Eric, the person that Don Imus most fun of was Don Imus. The next person he made the most fun of -- and even kiddingly called his wife a ho -- was his wife, his own family, the people on his own show. So it was n't applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're willing to give Chris Rock a pass. Sonia, is that inconsistent with... @!DEGGANS : If he would have... @(CROSSTALK) @!DEGGANS :... I do n't think we would have had a problem with that. @!HANNITY : Sonia? @!OSSORIO : You know, we 're talking so much about whether I or Eric as an individual or his organization is calling for him being fired. What we have n't talked about is the fact that there were thousands upon thousands upon tens of thousands of people who, six months ago, were outraged and really troubled over the comments that Don Imus made. And what that was, was a reflection... @!HANNITY : Did you ever ask for Jesse Jackson, did you ever ask for Chris Rock to be... @(CROSSTALK) @!OSSORIO : Again, I 'm not... @(CROSSTALK) @!OSSORIO :... what I wanted, who 's asking to be fired. Let 's look at the bigger issue. @!HANNITY : Is n't Chris Rock far worse than Don Imus? @!DEGGANS : No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!HANNITY : Yes! Yes, he is! Yes, in terms of his comments, absolutely. @!OSSORIO : No. @!HANNITY : Absolutely. @!OSSORIO : No. @!DEGGANS : Individuals pay to go to his show. Now, that 's choice. You told me I can turn off the radio. I walk into your... @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : He 's on television. Wait a minute, it 's on television, uncensored, every word used. Should Chris Rock... @!OSSORIO : On cable. On cable. @(CROSSTALK) @!HANNITY : Does it matter where he says it, in your mind? @!OSSORIO : It does. It does. @!DEGGANS : Don Imus show was simulcast on a cable TV news channel. There is a difference. @!OSSORIO : And if he wants to go to a cable network where people subscribe to it, that 's your choice. @!HANNITY : Unbelievable. What a double standard. You know what this is? @!OSSORIO : No, it 's not. @!HANNITY : This is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard. @!HANNITY : This is a phony double standard. @!OSSORIO : Not at all. Why are you talking so much... @!HANNITY : And I find the excuses pathetic. @!OSSORIO :... about me or what Eric wants? Let 's talk about what the American people want. @!HANNITY : They 'll tune in and listen to him. You do n't want to give him a choice. @!OSSORIO : His market share has been declining. @!HANNITY : We 've got to break. @!OSSORIO : And we will see. We will see what ABC does and what happens to Don Imus show. @!HANNITY : All right, I gave you the last word. Hillary 's stance on handling on Iran, some may call this a flip-flop. We 're going to play you her in her own words. We 'll let you decide. Back in 60 short seconds, straight ahead. '
