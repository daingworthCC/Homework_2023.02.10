Kate Middleton... @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB:... has been wearing sheer pantyhose in almost every single picture... @!GIFFORD: Who can tell? @!KOTB:... in the summertime. Now, except for when she wears open-toed shoes, someone said. Now, we 're wondering if that 's going to bring pantyhose back in the summer, or anytime. @!GIFFORD: Bobbie Thomas is shaking her head no. @!KOTB: Bobbie, what do you say? @!Ms-BOBBIE-THOMAS: No. @!GIFFORD: No. Bobbie says no. @!KOTB: Bobbie Thomas says no.

I think it 's great under certain things to help form your body. @!KOTB: Yeah, like Spanx. @!GIFFORD: Well, if you got Spanx you do n't need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really hot, there are so many other things you can use like bronzers or other stuff. So I do n't know, that 's where I side. @!GIFFORD: Well, I guess some ladies have the vein situation, and even some men like this gentleman. @!KOTB: What do you guys say? Ooh. So, guys, raise your hand -- raise your hand if you guys think pantyhose are OK in the summertime. I just want to see. Raise your hand. @!GIFFORD: We will get to you, Jeff Ross. @!KOTB: Raise your hand if you say no, no. OK. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: It 's an overwhelming no. The other thing that they 're setting trends on -- do you guys remember when Will and Kate were in Calgary, which is that famous... @!KOTB and @!GIFFORD:( In unison) Stampede. @!GIFFORD: Sounds like, yeah. @!KOTB: OK, anyway, so they were there for that and they wore these white cowboy hats, which were such the rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals.
