235541 NOAH ADAMS, Host : Over the weekend, President Bill Clinton did some self-assessment of his nearly 100 days in office so far. Although Mr. Clinton said during the campaign that he planned to take action on a number of major problems in the first three months in office, this past weekend he said he 's going to need more time to address serious economic and social problems. Our colleague, Linda Wertheimer, is traveling along Route 50 this week, talking to Americans about what they think of the president 's performance so far. Sounds of voices in background LINDA WERTHEIMER, Reporter : Route 50 starts in Ocean City, Maryland, and heads straight west. We picked it up in Chillicothe, Ohio, where the road comes out of the hills and heads across the Ohio Valley. The Meade Paper plant is the big employer, here, but the U.S. Shoe Factory, the plant that made Wearever pots and pans, and the railroad maintenance facility are all gone, now. Still, there 's a sense here that things are looking up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union message, where he presented his economic plan. ' Our Day in History ' was the headline on the Gazette the day he came, and the paper put out an extra edition - ' Hold Me Accountable. ' The president actually went running on Route 50. It 's Main Street, here in Chillicothe, on a cold, three-degree morning. He stopped at the McDonalds around the corner, on Bridge Street, to warm up. We 're at the Crispy Cream Donut Shop just across the street, here to talk to three people from Chillicothe about holding the president accountable. Jean Kearney sp is a college professor and a Democratic councilwoman. She worked on the Clinton campaign. Tom Burke sp voted for Ross Perot and made his Kroskey 's Tavern sp a kind of Perot headquarters. Ward Seymour sp is a life-long Republican, a councilman, retired from the paper company. I asked them who their heroes are, and Ward Seymour went first. WARD SEYMOUR, Chillicothe Resident : -Rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. laughs WERTHEIMER : laughs I guess that tells us something. Mr. Burke? TOM BURKE, Chillicothe Resident : Yes, ma'am. I suppose the former lord mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley sp, was one of them, and late lord mayor of Chicago, Richard Daley was another- people who knew how to use the system. Presidential timbre - John Kennedy @!WERTHEIMER There 's a little bit of an Irish streak running through this. Mr. BURKE : It was genetic, yeah. I climbed out of the same pool with my father @!WERTHEIMER laughs Ms. Kearney? JEAN KEARNEY, Chillicothe Resident : Well, you know, my definite hero was John F. Kennedy. John F. Kennedy stands very high, and I would- the second person that has excited me, in terms of politics, really has been Clinton, as far as getting excited. I really had n't been excited, since John F. Kennedy. And when Clinton came along, I got excited. So, in terms of the potential, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero @!WERTHEIMER Well, let 's talk about the potential. A lot of people had a lot of ideas about what they thought Bill Clinton might be able to do. Is he living up to any of those expectations, in your view, Mr. Seymour? Mr. SEYMOUR : I do n't see where he 's done anything. He 's failed with Congress, he 's backed off on his gays in the service. There 's different things that he 's backed off on, and I- and many promises he 's broken, so I- I really ca n't see where Mr. Clinton has accomplished anything @!WERTHEIMER Mr. Burke? Mr. BURKE : I read an article a week after Mr. Clinton was in office, and it was in one of the major publications, and I ca n't remember which one. It said, ' Clinton- The Failed Presidency? ' The guy 'd been in office a bloody week, and they were starting to put the nails into his palms. And his first major thud in the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a job-increase bill going. Whether or not it 's a good idea is immaterial. The point is that the Congress took this opportunity to slap him around and say, ' Welcome to Washington, Rube. ' WERTHEIMER : Now, Ross Perot was your man in this race, right? Mr. BURKE : Right, he was @!WERTHEIMER Not Bill Clinton? Mr. BURKE : No @!WERTHEIMER But you 're prepared to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt, anyway? Mr. BURKE : He 's my president. I looked around, and he 's the only one I got. And so, if you do n't at least give the man nominal support during the early phases of his presidency, you have no right, three years later, to say, ' Throw the bum out. ' WERTHEIMER : Ms. Kearney? Ms. KEARNEY : I 'm a realist, first of all, and this is not a race that Clinton is in. This is a journey. This is a journey that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time, and you expect some failure, because he 's willing to take risks. And that 's why I 'm so excited. He seemed to take risks @!WERTHEIMER What does Bill Clinton need to do for you, right here, in this part of Ohio? Ms. KEARNEY : I would like to see his economic stimulus get going, because we have, here in this community, we have a need for jobs. And whether that job comes through agriculture, or whether or not it comes through manufacture, or whether or not it comes through small services or what have you, or whether or not it comes through PICK sp programs where young people would have jobs this summer, we need jobs @!WERTHEIMER What do you think, Mr. Burke? Mr. BURKE : An economic future that is based on something less fragile than corporate agriculture, although we still have an enormously high percentage of individual-owned farms. And our economy was also- another leg of it was our manufacturing, but it was- it was heavy-industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are fading stars, in the firmament @!WERTHEIMER So, a new- a whole new basis? Mr. BURKE : We would hope. Any nation- although, any nation which allows its manufacturing 's infrastructure to wither and die - or move to Mexico, in our case - can not for very long claim status as a great nation @!WERTHEIMER So two votes for jobs being what this area needs. Mr. BURKE : Absolutely @!WERTHEIMER Mr. Seymour? Mr. SEYMOUR : Well, I agree that it needs jobs, but they do n't need temporary jobs. We need permanent jobs. You know where you get permanent jobs is with tax incentives and different promotions for manufacturers to locate here. You 're not going- you 're not going to promote any jobs by giving kids - as well as we need them - three-month jobs. That does n't cut the mustard. The $ 4 billion, I think it was, that was earmarked for summer jobs could be well put into permanent tax credits, things that 's really going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mentioned that the newspapers started declaring the Clinton presidency over in the first month. This, of course, now, is- it 's a little bit past the third month. When you- when you read about Washington, watch on television, listen to the radio about what he- what is going on, there, how do you feel about what you 're reading and looking at? Mr. BURKE : I think, in all deference to Mr. Clinton's- what I consider to be the most beautiful set of political skills I 've seen in a heck of a long time- he 's a better politician than John Kennedy. And I did n't think I 'd ever say that anybody could be. He is. He 's superb. But, at the same time, there 's a great difference between campaigning and running the government. That 's why I say, if we do n't lay back and let the guy have his head for a while, I think we're- we 're just absolutely setting him and us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get the job done, and maybe in four years vote screaming ends- Vote Nazi, vote Republican, vote Independent, vote for Perot, vote for whomever you want, but give the guy the chance to get the job done, and stop quibbling about the size of his bloody belt buckle. Ms. KEARNEY : We know how politics work. We 're not stupid. We all know that each party has things that they want to do. But we also know it 's the time, now, for them to pull together- both the Democrats and Republicans- to sit down and say, ' Where can we compromise? ' So, this is not a race between two kids tugging. This is our life, and these are, you know, our children 's lives that are unintelligible- that we are really totally losing. Mr. SEYMOUR : You 've got to understand who controlled Congress. He has a Democrat-controlled Congress. Reagan had a Democrat-controlled Congress, Bush had a Democratic-controlled Congress. So, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terrible shape, who put us in terrible shape, economically-wise? WERTHEIMER : Mr. Burke, I 'm going to give you the last word. Mr. BURKE : We have created a system of government where the needs of the nation and the interests of the nation are subordinated to the personal interests of the representatives and senators in being reelected. We have created that. I ca n't remember who the genius was who said a nation will always get- or a people will always get the government they deserve. We have. We are not a nation of citizens, any more- we 're a nation of special interests. As long as that situation persists, we will have the kind of miserable, groveling, disgusting government that we have, now, which is spending us into bankruptcy. Even my good buddy Ward, two blocks away from the Baptist church, will say they 're sending us to hell in a handbasket. And we are allowing it. And that 's a pretty dismal last word, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be the last word- either we shape up and start kicking some serious butt up that way, out your way, or we allow the thing to just trundle right on down into the cesspool @!WERTHEIMER Tom Burke was born and raised in Chillicothe. He owns the Kroskey 's Tavern, here. Jean Kearney teaches educational psychology at Audubon College in Westerville, Ohio. Ward Seymour is retired from the paper plant. We 're sitting, now, at the Crispy Cream Donut Shop. We can Main Street, Route 50, and we 're going to get back on that road again and head west. I 'm Linda Wertheimer, in Chillicothe, Ohio. to the accuracy of speakers ' words or spelling.
