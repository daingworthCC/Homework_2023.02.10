224541 Paula Zahn, co-host : It 's 17 minutes after the hour. More and more couples are finding it impossible to get by on a single income. But the stress on a marriage can sometimes outweigh the benefits of that double paycheck. Melvin Cross is a construction manager and his wife Laurie is a construction engineer. Besides their careers, they are also trying to raise two children. They join us this morning along with psychiatrist Jeffrey Satinover. Welcome to all of you. Melvin Cross( Double Income Couple) : Good morning. Laurie Cross( Double Income Couple) : Morning. Jeffrey Burke Satinover( Psychiatrist) : Morning. Zahn : Laurie, if you could, summarize for us why it is so difficult for you and Melvin to find any quiet time together either on weekdays or weekends? @!L-Cross : Basically, we start at 5 a.m. in the morning -- between 5 and 5:30 getting the kids up, getting ready, getting to work by 7 ; and lunchtime, workout if possible ; and by the time we get home, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath, spend some time with them, read a story, then do housework. By that time it 's about 11:30, 12 -- not a lot of time. Zahn : And you probably just drop into the bed. @!L-Cross : Yeah. @!M-Cross : Yes, sometimes. Zahn : Given that constant peace that you have to deal with, what is missing in your relationship right now with Laurie? @!M-Cross : Probably more free time -- just to be free, unscheduled free time. Zahn : Do you feel that you 've lost some of the intimacy in your relationship? @!L-Cross : No. We 've kind of adapted to our schedule. We 'd just like to have a little more fun, maybe a little bit more spontan -- spontaneity, you know. I 'd like to have more fun. Zahn : It sounds like they 've addressed their challenges in a -- in a -- a very smart logical way. What is the best advice you can give couples such as Laurie and Melvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough, tough, tough? Satinover : Well, I think there are probably three things that couples in this situation can do. First, even though it sounds unpleasant, they should schedule time with one another. Zahn : You mean literally write it down on a calendar. Satinover : Literally write it down. I mean, when I -- when I counsel... Zahn : Does that sound like it will work for you two? @!M-Cross : Wonderful. @!L-Cross : Mmm... Satinover : When I counsel people who are in this kind of a situation and -- and other similar situations, where communication between the couple has become to come under significant stress for whatever reason, sometimes a very important exercise is simply scheduling time because it focuses on making time that you spend together a priority. I -- I was driven over here by a very nice Egyptian gentleman named Neghi, and he was asking me what we were going to be talking about. And I went over it a little bit. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people have this problem. He said, ' Well, a marriage is like a business. ' And he 's absolutely right. Just as in a business, you would do what 's necessary to make a priority for an important meeting or an important task. Marriages have to be run the same way sometimes also, especially when there is n't a lot of free time. So scheduling time makes it a priority. Point number two is that couples need to also recognize that they may both come home the same night with high levels of stress. They have to have worked out some kind of a negotiating arrangement where one of them says, ' OK, I 'm going to be a listener tonight. You tell me about your problems. I 'm going to put mine on the back burner and I 'm going to be there for you. ' Zahn : That all sounds so clinical. Is that something the two of you seem to do naturally, where one is the supporter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!M-Cross : Well, we try not to bring too much of that home. @!L-Cross : Yeah, every day... Zahn : But, clearly, there are days, are n't there, where you 've had better days than others? @!L-Cross : There are days. @!M-Cross : Well, then we give and take. Depends on who seems to need it the most. Zahn : It seems to me the most obvious thing that would give them freedom right now is their kids having enormous extracurricular activities, but that 's something you 're not willing to give up for your kids to allow you more mobility and more time together. @!L-Cross : Not at this time. No. I could see maybe having a housekeeper come in ; that we 're looking into. That would probably free up a little bit more... Zahn : Might save you half-an-hour at night after you 've made the dinner. @!L-Cross : Yeah. It would -- it would save some more. It would save some time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly a mother 's helper sometimes would be helpful. Zahn : How frustrated do you get with all this? @!M-Cross : Not that -- just at times it gets to be a bit much. You know, you want to go outside and scream. So you go outside and scream. You come back in, ' Ah, that feels much better. Back to my schedule. ' Zahn : Do people find it that easy to release this pent-up frustration and fatigue? Satinover : Well, I do n't know whether -- whether this applies here, but my general sense is that an increasingly large number of couples are under a lot of stress. The marriages are under a lot of stress, and they do n't necessarily recognize or acknowledge it. They do n't -- they do n't see that, for example, the family -- the time spent with the family together is, really -- should be the number one priority and that there is a -- a healing quality that comes just from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a -- an ambitious and in many ways self-centered society that I think people lose sight of the fact that -- that their lives are probably going to be happiest and their kids ' lives are probably going to be happiest if they make time spent together -- it does n't have to be doing an activity that has future orientation, an ambitious orientation. Zahn : I think you get total agreement in this circle about that point. Satinover : Yeah. Zahn : Dr. Satinover, thanks for joining. Satinover : You 're very welcome. Zahn : Laurie and Melvin, appreciate your coming in as well. @!L-Cross : Thank you. Zahn : All I can say is good luck. You 're certainly not alone. A lot of us are trying to deal with what you are right now. Twenty-two minutes after the hour. Michael J. Fox coming up.
