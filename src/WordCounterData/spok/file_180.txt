4072741 MR. DAVID GREGORY : We 're back, joined now by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS. All right, we just heard from the leaders about all of the runs, hits and errors on Capitol Hill today. Let me ask a slightly larger question, Chairman Steele. If this is victory for the president on health care, at what cost did he achieve it. @!MR-MICHAEL-STEELE- : I think his defeat in the fall, in November. I think you can not ignore the past year of voters out there at town halls, in tea parties, in gatherings around the country, talking and conversing with their congressmen and elected officials directly, and then not having that listened to, having a deaf ear turned to them by the administration, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid. And I think the ballot box will be the last voice in this, in this big campaign for health care because the voters have made it very clear in poll after poll. They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a slower step approach. They want the reforms, but they want it in a way that really address the costs. You 're going to add 33 million people to the healthcare rolls. How do you effectively pay for it? And the way this is set up, those folks do n't hit the rolls until 2014 and later, which then jumps the cost of this to over $2 trillion. @!MR-GREGORY : But you wrote a, you wrote a letter this week to, to supporters of the RNC. @!MR-STEELE : Mm-hmm. @!MR-GREGORY : And you say this, " After a year a pushing his radical socialist health care reform experiment, Obama has just a few more days to wait to see " if " his number one priority " succeeded.... " If Pelosi can successfully cajole, intimidate, coerce her Democrat majority into approving a bill the American people are against by a 3:1 margin, Obama and the rest of the radical Democrats in Washington will see their dream of government-run, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, critics of, of that kind of appeal with that sort of heavy rhetoric say this is a healthcare package that is more moderate than President Nixon actually put forward. @!MR-STEELE : Well, not the way the American people see it. You 're taking one-sixth of the economy, and you 're basically turning it on a head -- on its head where you 've got more government controls put in place, more commissions, more regulatory processes that are put in place, $406 billion in new taxes, $507 billion in cuts to Medicare. You 've got this, this 94 -- 900 -- nine -- what, $940 billion CBO number, which even they say, " Well, it 's not the real number because there are other features of this that when they kick in will jump the cost to over $2 trillion. " So this is the, this is the predicate that has been laid for the healthcare debate that concerns people. I think that rhetoric is reflective of how people feel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's important for the administration and the leadership on the hill to understand that. @!MR-GREGORY : Governor, at what cost will victory be achieved? @!FMR-GOV-TIM-KAINE- : David, this is going to be great for Democrats. You know, I 've been on a ballot seven times and won seven races. I would love to be running on this. And I think the extreme nature of the rhetoric just shows how worried the other guys are. Here 's what 's going to happen. This bill passes, right away seniors get a break on purchasing prescription medications. Right away small businesses get a tax credit so they can afford to purchase insurance for their employees. Right away parents will be able to keep kids on their policies till they 're 26 instead of 21. And right away we stop the most heartless abuses of insurance companies kicking sick people around. That 's going to happen right away. The American public will see it. They wo n't see death panels, they wo n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't see any of the phantoms that the other guy 's created. And so if the -- if going forward into 2010, if they want to campaign, as the leader said a minute ago, Leader Boehner, on repeal, let them do that just like Alf Landon campaigned to repeal Social Security in 1936. This is going to be a big win for the American public, and every Democrat everywhere will get a tailwind because @!MR-GREGORY : But, Governor Kaine, you, you... @!GOV-KAINE :... they will have solved the big issue and done it well. @!MR-GREGORY : You and the White House, certainly, Democrats, make the argument, Let 's pass this thing and you 'll see the popularity increase. Former President Clinton has said the same thing because people will like the individual elements of the bill, they 're going to come around to this, even though a majority oppose the president 's version of healthcare reform now. And yet, if you look at how the stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was passed, here 's our latest poll that shows views about the stimulus package passed by the administration. Forty-two percent think it 's still a bad idea as opposed to 35 percent think it 's a good idea. What makes you so sure that people are going to come around on health care? @!GOV-KAINE : Well, well, look, David, here 's the deal. Before the stimulus was passed, the economy, as you know, was shrinking at 6 percent a year. It 's now growing at 6 percent a year. Before the stimulus was passed, the American economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month. Now we 've got it back to net even. This is not primarily about politics, it 's primarily about solving an issue that presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have tried to solved. @!MR-GREGORY : Well, that 's a fair point. But I 'm asking you a political question, and it 's not always about merits in politics. @!GOV-KAINE : But -- OK. Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the politics. @!MR-GREGORY : People do n't feel the stimulus. @!GOV-KAINE : What, what they see about the healthcare bill is if -- there are some polls, and you 've cited them, that, overall, people have concerns. Now, there were some polls this week that showed a majority are in favor. In fact, in the last six weeks, there 's been about a 13 point move in favor of healthcare reform. But the thing that 's important to know, and I know, I know you know this from your guys own poll, if you poll about the individual elements, " What do you think about reforming insurance so that they ca n't kick people off when they get sick or turn them down when they change jobs or because of pre-existing condition, " the American public says thumbs up. " What do you think about tax credits for small businesses? " Thumbs up. " What do you think about parents having kids on their policy? " Thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point. What I 'm trying to make -- say is that, that the package deal on the stimulus has not borne fruit, and what makes you so sure that it 's going to bear fruit on... @!GOV-KAINE : But it has borne fruit. The, the economy is now starting to go the right direction again. It was in a free fall, and the other guys would n't even pull the rip cord. @!MR-STEELE : But you 're not, but you 're not creating jobs, Governor. You 're not -- that 's the core of this, this debate, really, is not so much about health care... @!GOV-KAINE : CBO says we are creating jobs. @!MR-STEELE :... it 's more about -- well, tell that to the person who just got a pink slip yesterday. @!MR-GREGORY : Right. @!GOV-KAINE : Well... @!MR-STEELE : Because the reality of it is that people are still being laid off, jobs are not being created, and now you 're about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its head at a time when you can ill afford to do that. And the legacy here -- this is the key thing that we need to focus on -- if we do n't get this right now -- and I think we 're both in agreement that we need to get this right -- but if we do n't get it right, future generations are -- will not forgive us for passing on the debt and deficits that will come as a result of spending money we do not have today. @!GOV-KAINE : Well, David... @!MR-GREGORY : Well, let, let, let me, let me ask... @!GOV-KAINE : Yeah. @!MR-GREGORY :... the other political kind of corollary to this. Here 's a poll about Congress, which we 'll prepare, shows how people feel. The question was, " Would you vote to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including your own representative? " Fifty percent say yes. So in that case, Chairman Steele, how, how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall? Is it about repeal? @!MR-STEELE : It -- absolutely it 's about repealing. You know who 's framing the debate this fall? The people are. That 's the beauty of what 's happening right now. You 've seen this surge across the spectrum -- right, left, center -- people expressing what they want. The problem has been from the very beginning of this debate, David, that the leadership has not listened. This administration, this Congress has not listened to what people wanted. They 've gotten on their cell phones in the middle of town hall meetings, they 've asked for IDs. Here in northern Virginia, at -- in town hall meetings, you know, before you speak, you 've got to let me know if you 're in my district. People have an expression they want to make on this, on this healthcare debate, on the economy, and the administration and the Congress has n't let them do it. So, yes, this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to the poll... @!GOV-KAINE : Yeah. @!MR-GREGORY :... what about the tone of the debate? I asked the leaders about this. Some of the racial epithets, anti-gay epithets among tea party activists. Is there a danger for Republicans to be associated with the tea party movement? @!MR-STEELE : Well, we 're not associate -- well, we 're not -- no, it 's not a danger to be associated with the tea party movement. It is -- it 's certainly not a reflection of the movement or the Republican Party when you have some idiots out there saying very stupid things. So, as, as the leader said, as Leader Boehner said, that 's reprehensible, we do not support that. You can have this debate without, without attacking a member of Congress personally. @!MR-GREGORY : But do you think some of your own rhetoric in the RNC, that slide show you had from your finance director vilifying the speaker and the president, talking about socialist health care. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, inappropriate, and it should not have happened. And we 've dealt... @!MR-GREGORY : But what about your own fundraising letter? Does that kind of rhetoric spur activism that gets to a point of ugliness? @!MR-STEELE : Well, there 's a fine line between engaging your donors and your activists to get them fired up and go out, going out and, and do for you, to raise money, etc., and saying something, as we 've heard yesterday, that are racial epithets and anti-gay language. There 's a very -- there 's a very bright line there for us to not cross. And nothing we 've done or said on either side, Democrat or Republican, in the hot rhetoric of this, you know, I think comes to that. What you had out there yesterday were a handful of people who just got stupid and, and said very ignorant things. And neither party, I believe, are associated -- or should be associated with that. @!MR-GREGORY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing the fall. @!GOV-KAINE : Right. @!MR-GREGORY : You 've got stubborn joblessness, a high unemployment rate. How do Democrats use this healthcare vote to campaign in the fall? @!GOV-KAINE : Sure. We 're the solutions party, David. That 's the way we use it. I think the overheated rhetoric is one of the reasons why people, when they 're asked about Congress, say things like, " Well, we should replace it, " because they want to see not rhetoric but results. And so what we 've seen with the Democrats over the last year and a half is the economy was in a free fall, and the previous administration would n't even pull the rip cord to, you know, pull out the parachute. This president has done the heavy lifting to get the economy growing again. He 's done the heavy lifting to stop the job losses, and we 're doing the heavy lifting to do something that presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have tried, which is provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage to those who do n't have it. And finally, as the CBO said, tackling the unsustainable growth in healthcare costs. That 's what this bill does. I think the American public will always reward problem solvers over the folks who just, you know, throw rhetorical arguments and red meat to their base. @!MR-GREGORY : All right, let... @!GOV-KAINE : And we 're solving problems. And that 's how we win in November. @!MR-GREGORY : Let me conclude with this. I want to put something on the screen that Ron Brownstein also -- National Journal wrote about what we 've learned about the president 's leadership approach to issues like this. And this is what he wrote : " The health care fight has opened a second window into Obama. The key here is the ' 08 campaign assertion that Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America more than Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton did. The... struggle suggests that Obama views changing that trajectory as the ultimate measure of a presidency 's success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - one centered on a more activist government.... Everything else - the legislative tactics, even most individual policies - is negotiable. He wants to chart the course for the supertanker, not to steer it around each wave or decide which crates are loaded into its hull. " From each of you, what have we learned about the president 's approach to his job, to his presidency? @!MR-STEELE : I think he hit it right on the head. He -- this is a president who believes fundamentally in an activist government, not an activist business class, not an activist community of investors and, and those who will create the wealth in an economy. He sees that being centered -- coming out of the federal government, using the institutions and the apparati of, of federal government to achieve those ends. That is not what this country was founded on. It is -- fundamentally goes against every economic approach that we 've had. Whether you like capitalism or not, it has provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has not been created by government. And that, for me, is a fundamental difference between a Ronald Reagan and a Barack Obama. @!MR-GREGORY : What have we learned? @!GOV-KAINE : David, what I 'll say is what we 've learned is that the president is good to his campaign promise. He campaigned on the status quo is not working for the American public. The, the decade of the -- you know, the first decade of this century people lost income, we were losing jobs, the stock market was tanking, lax regulation led to meltdowns in the financial industry. And the president campaigned saying we 've got to change direction if we 're going to serve our people and be competitive in a global economy. And that 's why we see the heavy lifting to get the economy going again, to find a better energy future, to reform education, and, yes, to do what so many presidents have tried to do, solve Americans pressing health problems. I met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to graduate from college who 's got a, you know, congenital illness and said she 's going to go off his policy and what can he do? When a bill like this passes and parents can keep kids on their policy till they 're 26 or seniors get a break, we 'll be solving problems. That 's what this president was elected to do. @!MR-GREGORY : Do you think that, either of you, that you 'll be back here on this program discussing grand consensus between Republicans and Democrats in the course of this administration on another issue? @!MR-STEELE : I hope so. @!GOV-KAINE : I do. I do, yeah. @!MR-STEELE : I -- yeah, I hope so. I really do, because the country ca n't take what we 've just spent the last year doing. We can not, we can not approach the big issues that we face the way we have. You can not claim bipartisanship but then not invite the Republican leadership to the table or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MR-GREGORY : That, of course, would be disputed. @!GOV-KAINE : And, David, and here -- I mean, here 's a good sign. Senator Schumer and Senator Graham had an article that came out just two days ago talking about the fact that there can be bipartisan agreement on comprehensive immigration reform. And I think there are a whole series of issues where there can be. I wish that there had been some Republicans who would get on board with the healthcare bill that, frankly, owes an awful lot to their ideas. They 're going to miss this opportunity, but there are going to be other opportunities. @!MR-GREGORY : All right, to be continued. Thank you both very much. @!MR-STEELE : All right. @!MR-GREGORY : Up next, where does President Obama go from here? Plus, the very latest on the American public 's attitude toward the president and Congress from our Wall Street Journal poll with NBC. Our roundtable weighs in : NBC News chief White House correspondent Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insiders, Democrat Anita Dunn and Republican Ed Gillespie. It 's all after this brief station break. @(Announcements) '
