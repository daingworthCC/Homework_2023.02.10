National Margarita Day. @!KOTB: All right. So our Dr. Mixologist. @!Mr-DARRYL-ROBINSON: Doctor in the house. @!KOTB: Dr. Mixologist... @!GIFFORD: Thank you, Darryl Robinson. @!KOTB:... has brought some margaritas. @!Mr-ROBINSON: I have. @!KOTB: What makes these unique, Darryl? @!Mr-ROBINSON: This is a pomegranate margarita made with a nice reposado tequila revolution. @!KOTB: Uh-huh. @!Mr-ROBINSON: So... @!GIFFORD: So pomegranate means it 's also good for your sex life. @!Mr-ROBINSON: You know what, we do n't really want to say that, but I 'll let you say that. @!KOTB: Mm. @!GIFFORD: That 's what -- that 's what I 've heard. @!KOTB: By the way, he 's the host of the drink -- there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drink Up " on the Cooking Channel. @!KOTB: On the Cooking Channel. @!Mr-ROBINSON: Yes. @!KOTB: Thank... @!GIFFORD: Which some people have suggested should be the title of our show. @!KOTB: That 's terrible. @!GIFFORD: But listen, I did not know this, the original margarita was invented in 1948... @!KOTB: Wow. @!GIFFORD:... in Acapulco by a socialite. I bet she was a lot of fun. @!KOTB: And her name was? @!GIFFORD: Margarita Sames, right? @!KOTB: Uh-huh. @!Mr-ROBINSON: And the original margarita was really simple, just lime juice, agave and tequila. Not all this crazy sour and soda that you see in a lot of... @!KOTB: Just like that. @!Mr-ROBINSON:... three simple ingredients. @!GIFFORD: And it 's probably still -- is that what we 're having now, this is -- except the pomegranate. @!Mr-ROBINSON: You 're having agave, pomegranate... @!KOTB: I like it. @!Mr-ROBINSON:... salt on one side so you can watch your little lipstick. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, Darryl? @!Mr-ROBINSON: Because it 's... @!GIFFORD: People are getting weird. @!Mr-ROBINSON: Look at the color shirt, it 's National Margarita Day! @!GIFFORD: I know, but it gets your tongue green... @!KOTB: Gets on your tongue and all that. @!GIFFORD:... and makes your teeth green. @!Mr-ROBINSON: But that 's why I left one side unsalted. @!KOTB: Thank you, good doctor. @!GIFFORD: Well, that 's lovely of you. And we want to wish you all the best. @!KOTB: Happy margarita day. Thank you for coming. @!Mr-ROBINSON: Happy National Margarita Day. @!KOTB: Thanks for coming to see us, honey. @!Mr-ROBINSON: Thank you for having me. Cool. @!KOTB: All right. @!GIFFORD: Thank you. @!Mr-ROBINSON: All right, ladies. Cool. Bye-bye. @!GIFFORD: Thanks, Darryl. @!KOTB: All right. So yesterday, the president of the United States sang again. And this was one of those -- if you guys saw it, this is one of those full-court press kind of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!GIFFORD: It was blues night at the -- at the White House. @!KOTB: At the White House. @!GIFFORD: Right. @!KOTB: Mick Jagger. And anyway, they... @!GIFFORD: Celebrating Black History Month, I suspect. @!KOTB: Sure. And they were singing, and you 'll see, they were sort of egging him on, they said to the president, ' You know, look, you did it for Al Green, you know. ' @!GIFFORD: Well, he let the... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... genie out of the bag when he showed how well he can sing. I 'm anxious to see this. @!KOTB: Well, let 's watch this. @(Clip-of-President- @!KOTB: Ah! @!GIFFORD: He 's really got it! @!KOTB: He 's got... @!GIFFORD: He 'll have a new career after the White House, I think. @!KOTB: That 's... @!GIFFORD: You know. I do n't think B.B. King 's going to let him open for him, though. That would n't happen. @!KOTB: Ah, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some pipes. @!GIFFORD: You know what we did n't realize yesterday, Hoda? @!KOTB: What? @!GIFFORD: We want to apologize to anybody that we offended, we certainly did n't mean to. When we were talking about people that still have their lights up and their Christmas trees and all of that, we heard from quite a few people who said, ' You know what, we do that in -- out of love and respect and in longing for our loved ones overseas who are serving in the armed forces. We had absolutely no idea. @!KOTB: We did n't know that. And that 's... @!GIFFORD: But they keep the lights shining for them, and I think that 's awesome. @!KOTB: I thought that was terrific. Yeah, a lot of people responded on our Facebook page that that 's why they leave their lights on. Others... @!GIFFORD: Well, knowing that, I might turn mine back on. @!KOTB: Yes. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. Thanks, everybody, for letting us know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right. So, you know, everyone, if you did n't already fall in love with Adele, you probably fell in love with Adele at the Grammys. She won all the awards, she swept, she 's so humble and she 's great. @!GIFFORD: Yeah, yeah. @!KOTB: Anyway. So there 's sort of, I guess, the British equivalent of the Grammys in Britain and she was getting her award last -- I think it was last night. And she was giving her acceptance speech and it was weird because in the middle of her speech she got cut off, and then she decided to give a... @!GIFFORD: Let them know how she felt about getting cut off. @!KOTB: Yeah, let the crowd know. Let 's listen. @!ADELE:( From awards show) Then coming home with six Grammys and then coming to the Brits and winning Album of the Year. I 'm so, so proud to be British and to be flying our flag and I 'm so proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!GIFFORD: Wait a minute. @!KOTB: So at that point -- at that point... @!GIFFORD: This guy game up and... @!KOTB:... this guy comes up and he says to her, ' I 'm terribly sorry, but I 'm going to have to cut you off. And what you see, kind of fuzzy in the corner, is her giving -- letting everyone know who 's number one. Anyway. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. Well, she did n't do it to her fans, she says. @!KOTB: No. No. No, no, no. @!GIFFORD: It was like, ' Oh, really? Really? You know, then this is... @!KOTB: She said it was for the suits. @!GIFFORD: The suits. @!KOTB: The suits who cut her off. @!GIFFORD: Apparently somebody ahead of her, and this is why you should n't do this, had taken way too long and had not left enough time for her, which was the final one of the evening. @!KOTB: Yeah. Yeah. @!GIFFORD: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still unfortunate. @!KOTB: All right. So... @!GIFFORD: You know what else is unfortunate? @!KOTB: Oh, no, no. All right. Sheyla Hershey. @!GIFFORD: Or -- I think it 's Sheyla. @!KOTB: Sheyla. Sheyla Hershey. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: Anyway. We 've shown you pictures of her before. This is one from her Facebook page. Anyhoo. She... @!GIFFORD: I bet she 's fun at cocktail parties. @!KOTB: According to the -- to the headline, she does hold the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest breasts. She 's got 38 KKKs. And she actually wants to go to M 's, because I guess that 's next. @!GIFFORD: Well, it took her 13 years and 22 surgeries to get there. I -- why do n't they just do it all in one fell swoop? I do n't understand. Maybe your skin ca n't stretch that much initially, it has to -- you know? @!KOTB: Gradual. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: Anyway. @!GIFFORD: I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's on a -- she 's on one of those TLC reality shows, it 's called " My Strange Addictions. " And she says that she has more surgeries to increase her breasts to an M. But she had a staph infection and she had to go back to the K 's and not the M 's. Anyway, it 's very complicated. @!GIFFORD: Here 's the sad part of it, you know what, she 's obviously screaming for attention. You know, that 'll get them, that 'll get you some attention. @!KOTB: Yeah. Right. @!GIFFORD: But the sad part is that now she can no longer tie her own shoes, we understand, she -- Hoda, it 's not funny, it 's tragic. It 's -- stop it. And this is the worst one, she ca n't even hug her daughter. The arms just do n't go that -- they ca n't make room for another human being in there. So, you know -- I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's -- she 's addicted, definitely, to it. @!KOTB: Yeah, that 's an -- that 's an addiction. @!GIFFORD: But there is, you know... @!KOTB: Look -- yeah. @!GIFFORD:... this is a person if you take those breasts away from her does n't feel like she has any value... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... at all. And it 's a terrible role model for young girls. @!KOTB: I ca n't look at it. I 'm sorry. Anyway. I ca n't -- I know, I feel bad, I really do. @!GIFFORD: No, you don't. @!KOTB: I got -- I know it. @!GIFFORD: No, and nobody believes you. @!KOTB: I do n't know what to say about it. Anyhoo. OK, so here 's the thing, a lot of people do want cosmetic surgery and they want plastic surgery. @!GIFFORD: Yes. They want -- they want a face-lift. @!KOTB: They want a face-lift. So they... @!GIFFORD: And believe me, everybody that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starlets that are gorgeous, they go, ' I 'm never going to do anything. ' @!KOTB: Never. @!GIFFORD: The first -- agh! @!KOTB: They freak. @!GIFFORD: They run to the Botox. Right. @!KOTB: All right. So there 's a new study out that says if you do plastic surgery, a face-lift... @!GIFFORD: Right. @!KOTB:... if you do the full-on face-lift, if you 're wondering how many years that would take off your life -- let 's say you did it when you were 55... @!GIFFORD: Right. @!KOTB:... OK, or 60... @!GIFFORD: Which is when I should have. Right. @!KOTB:... or 65, they say it cuts off 7.2 years off of your looks. So if you think you 're going to look 10 years younger, 15 years younger, you 're really only going to look like you did seven years before, so. @!GIFFORD: Which I guess for some people is worth the price and worth the pain... @!KOTB: Sure. @!GIFFORD:... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people go in thinking, ' I 'm going to look 20 again. ' @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD: And the trouble is once you start there, then you got to -- you ca n't even go and take the hair out of your face without going -- giving yourself away because your hands do n't look eight years younger or 20 years younger. @!KOTB: Yeah. Yes. Yes. @!GIFFORD: So you got to do all of yourself. @!KOTB: Yeah, you do. @!GIFFORD: And then you spend most of your life recuperating from a surgery. @!KOTB: You know what... @!GIFFORD: And nobody knows you anymore and it 's bizarre. @!KOTB: Yeah. A friend of mine said before you go in for plastic surgery, if you want plastic surgery or a lift or something... @!GIFFORD: And not -- and we 're not putting down who wants it. Go ahead. @!KOTB: No, no, no. But before you do it, they said, if you can, take a week, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest. Rest, sleep, go on a teeny vacation and come back. If you still -- because often you get... @!GIFFORD: If you still -- yeah. @!KOTB:... one when you feel wiped out... @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB:... you 're exhausted, you feel run down... @!GIFFORD: Right. @!KOTB:... and you go, ' Oh, I need to do this now. When you 're on your best day... @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB:... to see if you really feel like you need it. @!GIFFORD: Or, I 'm telling you, you -- these fillers these days are so good you can -- you can look 10 years younger... @!KOTB: The fillers. Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... just with fillers if they 're done properly. Just do n't get 20 years worth at the same time. @!KOTB: And it 's hard to get lips at all because if you do anything to your lips, it 's so noticeable, do n't you think? @!GIFFORD: Yes. I know. @!KOTB: That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, I know, I know. Go to somebody who really knows -- find somebody, a friend, who looks fantastic... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD:... and ask her, or him... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD:... who did it and go to that person who 's reputable. @!KOTB: OK. @!GIFFORD: Not everybody can go to my precious... @!KOTB: Right. Dr. Wexler. @!GIFFORD:... Dr. Wexler. @!KOTB: All right. I 'm not going to like... @!GIFFORD: I 'm sorry, she 's just not available for everyone. She 's very busy....( mouths the words " with me "). @!KOTB: No, I 'm not going to like -- with you? @!GIFFORD: The other week. @!KOTB: You 've done something? How weird. I do n't like this story, so you 're going to have to do it. I mean, I know I 'm not going to like it. I do n't even know what it is and I do n't like it at all. @!GIFFORD: Apparently neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelle Davenport Burdick saw this ad and posted it in -- on our wall saying she thought of Hoda and how much she loves our show. @!KOTB: That is... @!GIFFORD: Oh, before and after. @!KOTB: What is it, before and after what? Is that a shampoo? @!GIFFORD: Oh, hair! The -- oh... @!KOTB: Oh, it 's a relaxer. @!GIFFORD:... the little lioness had her hair done. I ca n't imagine why she thinks that. That 's sweet, though, Hoda. @!KOTB: We also want to thank one of our fan of the weeks. You know, sometimes we send our fans to great exotic locations... @!GIFFORD: Almost every time. @!KOTB: Yeah, so... @!GIFFORD: Yes. There was just that one unfortunate trip we do n't want to talk about. @!KOTB: Yeah. A wonderful guy named John Coon posted this thank you picture. He said he had a lot of fun at... @!GIFFORD: At Abaco, right, Abaco Beach Resort. @!KOTB:... Abaco. Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand. @!GIFFORD: Oh, that -- you know what, that is so sweet. It was our pleasure. @!KOTB: Anyway. That 's in the Bahamas. So he had some fun there. @!GIFFORD: Good. @!KOTB: Excellent. All right. So we are doing an ' 80s show on Friday. OK, so do you remember what you looked like in the ' 80s? Take a picture, send -- I mean get one of the pictures and send them to us on our website because we want pictures of you with that ' 80s hair, the shoulder pads, remember? @!GIFFORD: You know what was weird when we were talking about doing this show, I could n't remember the ' 80s. And I -- it was n't for the reasons you might thing. I was so busy. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD: I had just moved from California to New York, I was working on another show. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD: And then Regis and I met Frank and all the -- those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and I could n't remember what... @!KOTB: The ' 80s at all. @!GIFFORD: No. I would -- I would mention a song and I would n't know what decade it came from. @!KOTB: Yep. Yeah. Yep. @!GIFFORD: You know, or a movie. I said, ' Well, I love that movie, they go, ' Well, that was in the ' 60s. I go, ' Really? I mean, you know... @!KOTB: The ' 80s was kind of a weird decade, it was the -- yeah -- Madonna, Michael Jackson, it was that kind of musical... @!GIFFORD: OK. So we 're going to go down Memory Lane on... @!KOTB: Yes, we are. @!GIFFORD: This is Friday, right? Right. @!KOTB: This is on Friday. We 're also going to do an ambush makeover. If you feel like you 're stuck in the ' 80s, you 're going to get made over. And I do n't know what else we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fun. @!GIFFORD: There 's going to be some surprises, so it should be fun. So send those to klgandhoda.com. @!KOTB: Do. All right, we got a big show. Sara 's got a new batch of photos that 'll make you say what the what? @!GIFFORD: What? And next up... @!KOTB: Oh, no. @!GIFFORD:... always love him. William Shatner is here. @!KOTB: Oh. @!GIFFORD: Be afraid, be very afraid. He 's going to let us into his wacky wonderful world, and that 's right after this. Give us a smile. '
