4082441 The Senate approved President Obamas tax plan today, sending it on to the House for final approval, but President Obama appears a bit worried that it may not pass now that the new opposition is springing up from the right. Right before the holidays, a number of celebrity couples have called it quits : Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds announce their divorce after two years of marriage ; Michael C. Hall, who plays Dexter, and Jennifer Carpenter, whos on the show with him got divorced ; and Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens also split up. Once upon a time doctors told the 400- pound Patrick House he was a ticking time bomb with only five years to live ; on last nights season finale of " The Biggest Loser " he proved to himself and obese people everywhere that you can lose the weight and turn your life around. @!JOY-BEHAR-HLN-HOS : " Time " magazine named Mark Zuckerberg their " Person of the Year ". By the way, I finished 83rd, right behind ex-flight attendant Steven Slater and the smoking baby. Take that, Mrs. Shendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on THE JOY @!BEHAR SHOW, its the holiday season of Hollywood splits. The recent rash of celebrity break-ups begs the question what is it about the holidays that pushes relationships to the brink? And infamous Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg is named " Times " " Person of the Year ". Joy, will take a look at who got snuffed. Plus, the new winner of " " The Biggest Loser " " Patrick House is here to talk about last nights victory and keeping the weight off over the holidays. That and more starting right now. @!BEHAR : Right before the holidays, a number of celebrity couples have called it quits. Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds announce their divorce after two years of marriage. Michael C. Hall, who plays Dexter, and Jennifer Carpenter, whos on the show with him, they got divorced. And Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens also split up. Someone please tell me that things are ok between Siegfried and Roy. Now lots of Americans will call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Here now to talk about this are Mary Jo Eustace, author of " Divorce Sucks ". Her ex-husband, Dean McDermott, married Tori Spelling. Remember that everybody. Bradley Jacobs, senior editor of " Us Weekly " is here and clinical psychologist and life coach for " Shape " magazine, Belisa Vranich. Bradley, what do you know about these break-ups? Come on. @!BRADLEY-JACOBS-SE : Well, lets talk about Ryan and Scarlett first because that was a big story for " Us Weekly ". This week we broke it. This was in the works for months. Scarlett was very unhappy. She was the one who pushed for the separation. They were very different people, you know. Ryan Reynolds is a person who likes to write poetry for his girlfriends, whereas Scarlett was a really realist. She grew up here in New York City. She has publicly questioned whether monogamy is for real or not, whether its -- so they were just different. This relationship -- also, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one marriage. As someone once said, somebody has to be the flower and somebody has to be the soil. Here you have two flowers in one marriage. It was just too difficult. @!BEHAR : The wind beneath my wings and all of that. @!JACOBS : Thats right. There was no wind. @!MARY-JO-EUSTACE-A : Exactly. @!BEHAR : Yes. Mary Jo, these couples were married. The ones I just mentioned, Scarlett and Ryan, and Michael and Jennifer, they were married for two years. Is that like the new seven-year-itch, two years? @!EUSTACE : Well, a few things I wanted to say. About three weeks ago, I saw Ryan Reynolds in a cafe. And he s Canadian, very reserved. He looked very depressed. So I knew three weeks ago something was up. This marriage was on the rocks. I know, big tip. I sort of equate it to this way, in Hollywood, one year of marriage is like dog years -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married two years in Hollywood, its like 14 years, you know. I think that its just so much harder to be married in that environment because these people are so entitled and so catered to that I think that they -- to take that into the relationship and actually have to work at something would probably be pretty challenging, I would imagine. @!BEHAR : Maybe its just because theyre all gorgeous and people are coming on to them all the time. Its like, why be with one when I can have great sex with the next one? You know, monogamous -- what do you call it - - serial monogamy. @!EUSTACE : Serial monogamy. @!BEHAR : Well, you know, not that theyre sluts, Im not saying that. Im just saying, you know, I did it with you now for two years. Enough. Next. @!EUSTACE : Its 14 years, Joy. Its 14 years. @!JACOBS : But also, do nt forget distance. I mean these people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are high demands on -- theres not a lot of time -- down time together. Relationships can be hard sometimes, even when youre living in the same city, living in the same house. @!BEHAR : Why do nt they learn from each other, in that case. What do you think, Belisa? @!BELISA-VRANICH-CL : Well, I have to tell you, what Bradley said about there has to be a flower and there has to be a stem. Often people, I think celebrities tend to marry people that look good with them or just as beautiful. Not necessarily people that complement them. And I think thats what we had -- @!BEHAR : But thats who they meet. Beauties meet other beauties. Dogs meet dogs. Thats how it works. I hate to -- @!EUSTACE : But thats the universe, though, right? Thats the university that they live in. I mean its like Joy said, its total access 24/7. They can get anything they want at any time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really, if you can get the next best thing all the time? Its very surreal. @!BEHAR : Theyre really not like the rest of the world, you know. @!JACOBS : No, no. @!BEHAR : Theyre just not. @!JACOBS : They live by different rules. Its sort of interesting that they also still have to lead by the rules of a marriage. Thats why so many of them do nt work out. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!VRANICH : And its not about dating. If you think about -- you do nt hear about people dating for the normal amounts of time or being engaged for the normal amounts of time. So really that combination of years, how it translates into different amount of dog years or cat years, thats it. @!EUSTACE : Right. @!BEHAR : Ok. Now, lets talk about the holidays because were in the middle of the holiday season and all these celebrity couples -- I mean I have a list of them from previous times. Like Reese and Jake, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn and Robin Wright, they filed for divorce in December 2007. Jessica and Nick, remember those two, Thanksgiving, 2005. What is with the holidays? Tiger Woods and Elins big break-up fight was on Thanksgiving 2009. @!Ok-Belisa-is-ther# @!VRANICH : Absolutely. There is -- holidays are a time when you evaluate how youve done and you plan for the future. So it makes sense that right before the holidays, you start looking around. You start adding things up and say, this does nt working for me and I do nt want to fake it anymore. @!BEHAR : But these just include Easter -- what about, you know -- I mean Christmas. What about Easter, what about all the holidays? Flag day? @!VRANICH : No, they do nt include Easter. Flag day, no. @!JACOBS : Theres all this pressure at this time of year. Its a family and fun time. But theres also a lot of stress involved. Travel and youre seeing family members that maybe push your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already sort of teetering on a breakup, this time of year might push it over the edge. And I think that thats what you see. @!VRANICH : It is the tipping point. It is. Its that tipping point moment for a relationship where they have to decide, is this going to work for us or is this not going to work for us for the coming year? So yes, youre going to see that. @!EUSTACE : Its also expectations right? Its the expectations you have of the holiday season. But for Hollywood, maybe December is like a clearance month, you know, to get ready for the New Year and the awards ceremony. And just so many kind of ship it out and you know, you bring something new in January, right? That makes sense. @!JACOBS : New Year, new you. @!BEHAR : Well, according it a recent study conducted by Facebook, which is not a scientific study -- but they asked a lot of people -- two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!VRANICH : Yes. @!JACOBS : Yes. @!BEHAR : So, the holidays. Shouldnt people wait until after Christmas, especially when they have kids. I do nt think Scarlett has any children. @!JACOBS : No children there. @!BEHAR : A lot of these people do nt have children so its really all bets are off if you do nt have children and its not working out. Who really suffers? @!VRANICH : And one of the things is -- @!EUSTACE : You should wait for your gifts though. @!BEHAR : You should wait for the gifts. @!VRANICH : I think thats part of it. Its the gifts. You do nt want to give gifts to someone youre not getting along with. So I think that theres a little practical element in there too. @!BEHAR : But also, you know, if theres a third party involved, the third party -- this is for real people now, not all these movie stars, its for us. If theres a third party involved, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell -- a lot of cases like this, you have to tell the wife and kids, look, Im not coming home for Christmas because I have to be with her. Thats really lovely. @!JACOBS : Joy, there is a famous one that you did nt mention. @!EUSTACE : Thats an excellent point actually. @!JACOBS : What about when Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston went away for New Years, they went to a warm resort in Mexico and thats where they decided to break up and they came back and announced it? It was famous. @!VRANICH : Good point. @!BEHAR : Jennifer Aniston -- tell me that. Tell me this again. @!JACOBS : Remember that one? @!BEHAR : I do nt remember. Refresh my memory. @!JACOBS : He wore that famous trash T-shirt when they were walking on the beach, him and Jen. It was one of the last photographs ever taken of them. And they came out back and they announced that they were separating amicably at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bad time to go away with someone when youre on the rocks because then youre alone with them. And theres no distraction. You say, oh my God, I cant believe I have to be stuck with this person. @!VRANICH : The distraction is something, but I think people choose the holidays because theyre distracted by other things that are happening so people do not focus on their relationship breaking up. Theres too many other things going on. So thats one of the reasons they may choose that. @!BEHAR : But Mary Jo, do you think if there are children involved, they should postpone it until after Christmas? Wouldnt that be nice? @!EUSTACE : Yes. Yes. I mean, you know, actually I think that really in consideration to your children, you shouldnt break up your marriage at Christmas. It sort of, you know, sets a precedent for every year. @!BEHAR : yes. @!EUSTACE : Actually, when my marriage imploded, it happened right before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him the night before school. I said thats not going to happen. In the real world, you have to make better decisions than that for your family. You celebrate Christmas as a family and then you ease the family into it. Its not a good time. @!BEHAR : But if you cant stand each other, how are you going to look at each other over the yuletide thing? @!EUSTACE : Be an adult maybe. @!BEHAR : Being an adult, yes. @!EUSTACE : Yes, fake it. Were all used to faking it, lets face it. @!BEHAR : I know. What about the recession were in? Supposedly were in a down time economically. Does nt that play into it? I mean can people afford -- Im not talking about Scarlett now. Im not talking about Zac Efron also. Theyre kids. Maybe that was a problem. @!JACOBS : Right. That relationship ended because they met when they were 17 and 18 years old. They just grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different are you at 17 than at 22? Im amazed that these two lasted as long as they did. @!BEHAR : I got married when I was 22 and it lasted 16 years. Yes, it did. It can work. It did nt it work for 16 years. It only worked for a year. Thanks, everybody. @!EUSTACE : Thats the problem. @!BEHAR : We have to go. I know. Well be right back. I hope people stay together for Christmas though. It would be nice. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Coming up a little later on the JOY @!BEHAR SHOW, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is named " Time " magazines " Person of the Year ". And the latest on the feud between Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore. Now back to Joy. @!BEHAR : Once upon a time doctors told the 400-pound Patrick House he was a ticking time bomb with only five years to live. Well, this story has a happy ending because on last nights season finale of " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obese people everywhere that you can lose the weight and turn your life around. And Patrick is here with me now along with Bill Germanakos -- Germanakos -- " The Biggest Loser " winner from Season 4our, and the Cheryl Forberg " The Biggest Loser " nutritionist. Welcome to the show. Patrick, congratulations. @!PATRICK-HOUSE- " TH : Thank you. I appreciate it. @!BEHAR : What does it mean to you to have lost all that weight? @!HOUSE : Oh this means the world to me. You know, I have such a special family. My wife and my two boys, Colton is four and Caden is two. And I just know that Im going to be able to be around for them longer now and be able to play with them and not tire out after just a couple of minutes. Its just a special night for me last night. And winning " The Biggest Loser " I mean, its fantastic. @!BEHAR : Your wife must be happy too. @!HOUSE : Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. You know while I was on the ranch, she lost a little over 50 pounds. She went from a size 14 to a size 4. So shes come a long way as well. @!BEHAR : Thats pretty good. @!HOUSE : Yes maam. @!BEHAR : And you were 400 pounds. @!HOUSE : I was, yes, maam. @!BEHAR : And but youre 62 ". @!HOUSE : Yes, maam. @!BEHAR : But how -- well, why did you get to that, do you think? @!HOUSE : Oh you know, I played -- I played football in college at Delta State University. And I got hurt playing football. I ended up having to have back surgery for a couple of ruptured disks. And you know I ate a lot and I have a special diet to maintain that weight to playoff end of line. And unfortunately when I got hurt, you know I lost the exercise and I lost the football practice -- @!BEHAR : And just kept eating. @!HOUSE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the course of four or five years, you know 20, 25 pounds a year, here you are at over 400 pounds. @!BEHAR : Thats a lot. @!HOUSE : Yes, maam. @!BEHAR : The doctors said you were going to die. @!HOUSE : Dr. H. On the show told me that I was five years away from a major heart catastrophe. @!BEHAR : A heart attack. @!HOUSE : And thats at 28 years old. Yes, maam. @!BEHAR : So this was -- that was your wake-up call? @!HOUSE : Thats when I -- you know you always see in the paper, you hear somebody, oh so-and-so, 33 years old, heart attack and died. But you never think it would be you. But hearing those from Dr. H. on the show, it really opened my eyes and knew that -- just how dangerous -- just how dangerous the situation was for me. @!BEHAR : Right. Theres diabetes, heart attack, cancer ; all sorts of things that could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how common is this among overweight obese people that they really have to get a wakeup call. Youre going to die if you do nt lose it? @!CHERYL-FORBERG-NU : Its -- its not unusual. And can I just say congratulations, Patrick. I -- I wasnt in L.A. to see the finale last night but Im so proud of you. @!HOUSE : Thank you. @!FORBERG : Yes and -- but Ive been with the show since the beginning, Joy. And its -- its been very common each season. I see the same symptoms over and over again. The contestants come to the show often with weight-related type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, fertility issues. Its a whole slew of weight-related -- @!BEHAR : Right. @!FORBERG : -- issues. And -- but -- oh, Im sorry, go ahead. @!BEHAR : No. I was going to say, Bill, did you have those issues too? @!BILL-GERMANAKOS- " : I did, you know thats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I was a collegiate athlete. I played lacrosse, I tore up my knee and you know kept eating the way I had before. And you know, I think theres a little depression in there too that we kind of -- I was -- we were taught -- I was taught on the ranch by our psychologist, that hey, listen, you know, you might be replacing your -- what made you the man before, sports and such, with food. You know, so it was explained to me that I had an addiction and it made me feel -- I was medicating with food. A lot of times the athletes who retire early or get injured have that same sense. @!BEHAR : Thats -- its interesting that youre replacing -- it was kind of like food is an addiction too. So usually people have an addiction they replace it with another addiction. Hopefully its a good addiction like exercise. @!GERMANAKOS : Well, thanks to someone like -- @!HOUSE : Like working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : -- someone like Ms. Forberg on the show, she taught us how to be addicted to more healthy food. @!BEHAR : Like -- how did you lose it? Tell me how you guys lost it. What did you do? @!HOUSE : You know, I mean, for me going home, losing on the ranch, on the ranch its a -- its a great place, you know, to start weight loss. @!BEHAR : You have help. @!HOUSE : With Bob and Jillian and youve got the help. Going home was where the real challenge for me. And you know, getting into -- coming home, I was fortunate that you know my wife had already made those changes with her taking the junk food out of the house and already starting to prepare healthy meals. I came home into a changed household. And that really helped me just propel my weight loss and continue. You know I lost 60 pounds at home. And that really helped me to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, do nt you think Cheryl, to have somebody helping you with the food. Because you have to prepare stuff, its very difficult. @!FORBERG : Its very difficult. Its a vertical learning curve in the beginning for most of the contestants because typically theyve had a history of skipping meals. Sometimes getting enough calories from their beverages alone to meet their daily needs because they do nt know what their calorie requirements are. Not having enough fruits and vegetables. Not drinking much water and -- and certainly not having a lot of exercise in their daily plans. So its all about finding a new learning curve and moving forward with that and implementing all the changes at home as well. @!BEHAR : Right. So -- so as a person watching at home, what would you say to them? What should they do? Lets say they have to lose 30 pounds. @!HOUSE : You know -- @!FORBERG : Ok. @!HOUSE : -- like I said, whether you have to lose 30 pounds or like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step, you know. And -- and just changing your diet is not enough. Youll lose some weight -- especially at 400 pounds -- youll lose some weight when you change your diet. But youve got to incorporate exercise and youve got to get out there -- @!BEHAR : How much exercise, though? Realistically, how much can a person who works a 9:00 to 5:00 job do in -- in the course of the week? @!HOUSE : Well, youd be amazed that what you can do just by changing small things. Like when you go to the grocery store and parking at the farther parking spot and walking in. There are small things, taking the stairs when you go to work instead of the elevator. Things like that. You can get in an exercise without actually having to take yourself to a gym and work out. And those things add up, thats calories burned and weight loss is calories in, calories out. @!BEHAR : Ok, so incorporate the exercise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its very hard for people to get this into their heads. Drink more water. That seems to be crucial, right, Cheryl? The water seems to be very, very important in losing weight. @!FORBERG : Thats right. And there are a number of -- of reasons for that. One is that when were changing the eating plan here, we eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain. The -- this eating plan, the distinction here is that the quality of the calories is just as important as the quantity. And when were having four cups of fruits and vegetables a day and a lot of whole grains, were increasing our fiber intake. And when you do that, you need to have a lot more water as well. @!BEHAR : Right. See, thats the thing. You have to have all these fruits and vegetables and all of this water. Somebody has to be there to give this to you if you are working all day. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ask you something, you two were unhealthy. Why did nt you just go for one of the surgeries instead of going through all of these, the gastric bypass or the banding? @!HOUSE : You know, for me that was like the last option. And before I made " The Biggest Loser " in February of this year, I lost my job in January and February came around. That was kind of my -- I was looking at, maybe now is the time to take that step and have a lap band surgery. But fortunately for me, " The Biggest Loser " came around at the time that gave me the opportunity to lose this weight on my own. @!BEHAR : But if it did nt, would you have done it? @!HOUSE : You know thats a decision I probably would have made with my family. Im not sure if I would have or not. At that point I was looking at my career and my family, my( INAUDIBLE). You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and get a job. The interviewing process is hard. I worked in sales. And immediately when you walk in the door in a sales job, its tough when youre 400 pounds trying to sell a product. @!BEHAR : Exactly. Thats another thing. @!Ok-Were-going-to-# @! HOUSE : To see that your work has paid off, you know. I mean, weve all burned it up in here. The first step was seeing that number, you know, just kind of fuels the fire to just keep it going. @!HOUSE : Big guy, huh? @!BEHAR : Im back with my panel. I did nt recognize you. @!HOUSE : Yes, maam. @!BEHAR : Its amazing how the face gets out of shape too when you gain a lot of weight like that. @!HOUSE : It is. Lets talk about the holiday season, Cheryl. Its upon us. Everywhere I go theres food now, you know. And theres hors doeuvres, which are killers. Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dinner, you know. And theres booze. What are we supposed to do? @!FORBERG : Well, I actually have a nice blog about holiday cocktails on the shows Web site, and how you to navigate that. But its important going into the holidays to not just make that assumption that Im going to it gain ten pounds or five pounds or whatever like I do every year. Its not enough to say, Im going to start January 1st. Begin today. Just start off with a little bit of exercise and gradually build up. And knowing that youre going into the holiday season with all of these indulgences everywhere around you, its really important. And if youre going to a party, for example, try to make something, prepare something or take something along thats healthy so you know there will be at least one good choice there. @!BEHAR : I see. Well, a lot of people say you shouldnt eat at the cocktail party. Make a decision to either have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat anything or do nt drink anything and plan the dinner, a step stiffer. What do you think about that, Cheryl? @!FORBERG : Thats a great idea. @!BEHAR : Too stringent? @!FORBERG : No, I think its a great idea to eat before you go and just plan on socializing. Thats what its all about anyway. @!BEHAR : Thats right. Just network and socialize. Now, Bill, youre a fitness instructor. @!GERMANAKOS : I am a group fitness guy. I do speaking engagements for health and wellness. @!BEHAR : How much does willpower play in all this? @!GERMANAKOS : Well, as opposed to willpower, we just say, try to keep your goals in mind. People say well, how do you stay motivated? And for me, I mean I havent hit my goals yet. My goals are to walk my two little girls down the aisle one day. My youngest is only 11. So I still have to work towards that goal. And every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brownie, have something. Just have one. It will taste great. I say, its not going to be as great as -- taste as great as me walking them -- @!BEHAR : Well, I do nt understand what you mean. You could walk them down the aisle right now if they were of age. @!GERMANAKOS : If they were of age but, you know, in 20 years will I still be able to I do so? This is why Im motivated to keep going. And you know, when people say motivated, you know, everybody gets up and brushes their teeth first thing in the morning. We get up and brush our teeth and go to the gym. Weve just changed our habits a bit now. @!BEHAR : Right. @!GERMANAKOS : And on holiday mornings, why ruin an entire month of working out just for one holiday? Whats great is if you eat correctly and you stop drinking, people will see youre doing that, they might take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BEHAR : Do you have a last thing to say to the audience to encourage them? @!HOUSE : Yes, maam. You know, Im excited with the question about the holiday eating. My first blog on my Web site is going to be about holiday eating and weight loss tips. My Web site launched last night. Its at **28;1470;TOOLONG. And Im excited about that. And just, you know, you have to get out there. You have to take that first step. Get out of your comfort zone. And you know, I mean Bill and I, were not superheroes, were just normal guys. @!BEHAR : Stop it. Youre both superheroes. And so are you Cheryl. Thanks very much for joining me tonight. Congratulations Patrick. Be sure to tune in to the new season of " The Biggest Loser " January 4th on NBC. Well be back in a minute. JOY @!BEHAR, HOST : " Time " magazine has named Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the " do nt touch my junk " guy. With me now to talk about this and other stories in the news are Rebecca Dana, senior correspondent for the Daily Beast, fashion designer, David Meister, and Tia Carrere, actress and singer who was recently nominated for her fourth Grammy. Congratulations to you, Tia. : Thank you. @!BEHAR : Rebecca, Facebook has been around for a while. @!REBECCA-DANA-SENI : It has. @!BEHAR : And the " Social Network " made him seemed like a jerk, frankly. @!DANA : Yes. I mean, not that thats autobiographical in the slightest. But yes, it made him seem like a jerk. He gives some money to the New Jersey school system. Facebook is kind of a big deal, but -- @!BEHAR : One in ten people on the planet is on Facebook. Thats pretty big. Thats probably what it was. @!DANA : Yes, its not insignificant. And I think, also, like, Julian Assange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ph) question is who cares? Why does " Time " magazines Person of the Year still exist? Like, Adolf Hitler, all right, I get it. @!DANA : Thats a man of the year, but Mark, its like why? Its so anachronistic. Its such a bizarre -- @!BEHAR : Well, who would you -- @!DANA : I do nt. I dont. @!BEHAR : Would you have put Sarah Palin on the cover? @!DANA : No. I think nobody. I think this is like a stupid thing to do, in the first place. @!BEHAR : Just have a blank page. Its brilliant. @!DANA : I mean, this is what " Time " magazine has been doing for the last five years. They did you which had sort of like mirrored covered. I just do nt even know why this thing exists. Why do we need to have a Person of the Year? @!BEHAR : Well, you know, the other thing is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person. Charles Lindbergh was the first in 1927. He was 25. Do you think maybe theyre trying to go for the younger demographic, David? @!DAVID-MEISTER-FAS : I think absolutely. You know, I think its a very safe choice as well. @!BEHAR : Who? Zuckerberg? @!MEISTER : Zuckerberg. Everybody knows the Facebook. The thing that I find ironic is the fact, you know, the internet is stealing so much business away from the magazines at this point. And a magazine is actually picking someone from the internet as their man of the year. I think theres something little ironic there. @!BEHAR : Why do you think they did that? They want to get those people to read their magazine. @!MEISTER : And I think again, the younger demographic is absolutely true. @!DANA : Well, the truth about this thing is also is that theyre really just naked commercial gambits. Like, part of the reason they chose Mark Zuckerberg is because Mark Zuckerberg gave them an interview, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people get interviews with Mark Zuckerberg. Im sure, its like, I do nt know, Gaddafi gave them an interview that was really great. Maybe, Gaddafi would be the man of the year. @!TIA-CARRERE-ACTRE : But do nt you think he really deserves being Person of the Year. I mean, he s changed the way that we communicate, for better or for worse. I mean, we have followers. We have virtual friends. I mean, we do nt even know how to communicate on a deeper level due in no small part( INAUDIBLE) Facebook. You know, its like the greatest hits. Its an upsizing of our lives. This is the way we approach every relationship now. @!BEHAR : Thats true. @!CARRERE : I mean, I do nt like it, but you know, my father was able to find three friends that he knew in childhood in the Philippines from Facebook, and they got together and did the three-part harmonies. @!BEHAR : Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so, it works. @!DANA : I think theres no question that Facebook has completely revolutionized the way we socialize, the way we interact, the way we live online. Im just not sure why this year as opposed to five years ago when he started -- @!BEHAR : Rebecca, only five women, individual women in all the years that theyve been doing this, which is how many years -- hundreds and hundreds of years, whatever. I do nt know how many years. Corazon Aquino, you said that youre part Filipino. @!CARRERE : Yes. @!BEHAR : And Queen Elizabeth II. General and Madam Chiang Kai-shek, but she came with the husband. Hello. And Wallis Simpson. Remember, that was the one that King Edward gave up the crown for Wallis Simpson. She must have done something really good. @!OK-Moving-on-In-re# @!DANA : I make exactly the same thing. I mean -- @!DANA : I do nt understand why these things exist. Im sorry to be such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, people -- like Sandra Bullock did a cover hoisting up her beautiful adopted child for " People " magazine. Elin Nordegren is also on their list, also gave an exclusive to " People " magazine. Like, its wonderful to celebrate these great people. And Mark Zuckerberg is a visionary, and Sandra Bullock, who does nt love Sandra Bullock? But, you know, we might as well acknowledge whats going on here which is that everybodys scratching each other backs, which is fine. But thats what it is. @!BEHAR : Well, you know what, its all about the cheating guys. Im thinking of giving Steve Ashley Dupres number. Then, Ill be on the -- @!MEISTER : Youre in the cover( ph). @!BEHAR : Yes. She was not exactly a controversial choice this year, Sandra. Everyone loves her. Shes Americas sweetheart. She happens to be a lovely person, it seems. So, its no big deal. @!CARRERE : Whats the underdog story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails against a cheating husband. I mean, country songs have been written about it. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!CARRERE : And you know, shes beyond reproach. And like you said, it is a little bit of blatant consumerism who does nt love her, whos not going to pick up the cover of this magazine. @!MEISTER : I think the one thing thats great about her is through all the press and the paparazzi and through all these horrible things, shes had a great year and shes had some sucky things. Shes never once really sunk to any low level. Shes always just gone about her life and done her thing. @!BEHAR : Right. How do you like the way she dresses, David? @!MEISTER : Shes stunning. @!BEHAR : Shes stunning. @!MEISTER : She can go from glam to rocking. @!BEHAR : Did you like my top? @!MEISTER : You look fabulous, and that color is great on you. @!BEHAR : OK. Thank you, David. @!BEHAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood seniors -- this is a good one -- Betty White and Ed Asner got rowdy during the photo shoot for the " Hollywood Reporter ". And Betty actually grabbed Ed Asners crotch. Unfortunately, he s so old, he just turned his head and coughed. @!BEHAR : OK. Now, what do you think of senior citizens acting in these ways? Because, you know,( INAUDIBLE) grabbed her boobs. @!DANA : I hope when Im Betty Whites age, someones grabbing my boobs like that. @!BEHAR : What if theyre fake, and someone grabs them, and you know, theyre fake, is that the same jollies than an old guy is going to get? I do nt know. @!MEISTER : I do nt know. At that age, theyre going to be hanging. I do nt know. @!BEHAR : No, they wont be. Everything will be hanging, but they will be perfect. @!MEISTER : Perfect. Youre right. @!CARRERE : Oh, my goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though, has nt she? Shes( ph) invited that anyway. @!DANA : Yes. I think its wonderful. @!BEHAR : Im so surprised at Ed Asner, did nt you? @!DANA : I do nt know. @!BEHAR : He later threatened Larry Hagman, another older guy, with his cane. And Hagman said, I had a colonoscopy yesterday, so I can take anything, he said. Whoa. TMI, Larry. OK. Lets do another story. In what is becoming a trend for powerful Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell choked up during a farewell speech to retiring Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. Take a look. @! MITCH-MCCONNELL-@ : Now, to say that I tried to convince Judd to stay is an understatement. But he knew it was his time to move on. And to write the next chapter -- next chapter in his life. When he walks out of this chamber for the last time, hell leave an enormous void behind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I have two words for you, Glenn Beck. These people are not stupid. And they are learning from a master populist here. I would not be surprised if all of this is orchestrated, first of all. Second of all, I wouldnt care if they were crying all the time if they were also getting something done. But instead, theyre just crying all the time. @!BEHAR : All the Republican guys are crying historically or all the Republican women are out shooting animals. Its like a role reversal. @!DANA : Yes. @!MEISTER : You know, Im all for a little man emotion, but this is crazy. Its like Senate floor, slippery when wet. I mean, of all the things we could be crying over, of all the real issues to cry over this country, the things that theyre crying over, its like come on, guys. Suck it up. @!BEHAR : But where are the Republican tears for the unemployed and uninsured? Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same guy -- @!BEHAR : Give me a break. Emotionally unstable. I do nt think its a put-on. I think theyre really sick. Somethings wrong with them. @!CARRERE : I wonder if they have a change in the middle of life the way women do. Im wondering if theres a hormonal imbalance. @!BEHAR : I know. Well, when Glenn Beck starts to fan himself -- @!DANA : Then they have chalk boards( ph), then well know for sure, but I wouldnt be surprised if this is in some measure calculated. @!BEHAR : But they cant stop. I mean, if they start to filibuster, its going to be a tsunami. @!BEHAR : I mean, can they lead in this particular emotional state? @!DANA : Yes. I mean, can they lead in any emotional state? @!CARRERE : Im just happy that it breaks up the monotony of C-span. Lets be honest. Youre sitting there -- its like Charlie Browns( ph) picture, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im waiting for full frontal nudity next. Thats what I want. @!BEHAR : John Boehner, lets see what youve got. Man up. What have happened to man up? That only goes for Democrats? @!CARRERE : Republican women, apparently. @!BEHAR : For republican women. Man up. Grow some hair on your lip. Thanks, everybody. Well be right back. @!BEHAR : The Senate approved President Obamas tax plan today, sending it on to the House for final approval, but President Obama appears a bit worried that it may not pass now that the new opposition is springing up from the right. Listen to what he said today. @! BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : I know there are different aspects of this plan to which members of Congress on both sides of the aisle object. Thats the nature of compromise. But we worked hard to negotiate an agreement thats a win for middle class families and win for our economy. We cant afford to let it fall victim to either delay or defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Stephanie Miller, host of the " Stephanie Miller Show " and Tara Wall, conservative commentator and contributor to the Daily Caller. OK, Tara, let me start with you. First, we saw democratic opposition. Now, it looks like the GOP are fracturing. Whats going on? @!TARA-WALL-CONSERV : Well, I think, you know, many of those in the GOP who are essentially looking at potential runs in 2012 know this is going to be an issue that this is going to be the can thats going to be kicked down the road, if you will, on this, because 2012 is when, you know, some of this the tax relief expires. And I think theyre positioning themselves, probably, legitimately so to raise a very real issue about what happens next when the tax relief expires, when we do nt address the deficit and other very real issues that some believe have been -- are posed with this tax deal. It is a compromise. It is bipartisan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there are some legitimate issues that are raised. @!BEHAR : Let me ask you, Stephanie, do you think that some of the people in the GOP are really against it now because it makes Obama look good? @!STEPHANIE-MILLER- : Of course, yes. I mean, thats exactly it. Look, the one reason to be for it now, Joy, is that Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin are against it. Thats a good enough reason. But, I mean, you know, I was wondering when they were going to start to wake up to the -- you know, they just ran on reducing the deficit, but theyre fine adding tax cuts for the rich. Theyre going to add the huge vault of these deficits. Thats what theyre fighting. @!BEHAR : You know, Tara, lets get a little specific. What is the main complaint from the right on this now? I mean, they got their beloved tax cuts on the right. What are they complaining about? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I do nt believe its all the right( ph). Again, you have select folks like Sarah Palin, like Mitt Romney who are running essentially. Of course, they havent announced, but you know theyre positioning themselves for positions down the line and for potential public runs. Im not saying that does nt make the arguments legitimate. I think the fact is we have very real issues with our current tax code. It is a monstrosity. And I think the conservative who rightfully raise the issue of, number one, how were going to lower the deficit. Number one, why were adding to the deficit when you talk about things like a payroll holiday, you know, when Social Security is going to be insolvent, and this increases the time in which its going to be insolvent. Those are very real issues when you talk about, you know, tax relief being temporary and going back to penalizing, if you will, those who contribute to society, whether theyre small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reason alone are taxed. The fact that we have unfair corporate tax rate by President Obamas own deficit reduction commissions admissions. Those are very real issues that still have to be addressed outside of the current tax plans. @!BEHAR : Democrats are still in charge at this moment. And 59 percent of Americans support the plan. So, what are they going to do, really? What are Romney and Sarah Palin really doing? Stephanie, want to answer that? @!MILLER : Well, Joy, first of all, I can tell you why they do nt like the bill because its not mean enough. You know, you have to remember, Joy, this is a party that just against health care for 9/11 responders. They voted to let -- @!MILLER : Right before Christmas. Right before Christmas. I mean, if there was a bill about slapping food out of orphans mouths, they would vote for that. If there was a bill about pushing old ladies down the stairs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyre not going to grow a sense of decency in January. I think this is the best deal we can get, Joy. @!BEHAR : Tara, let me ask you. @!WALL : Attack Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney are not voting for anything because theyre not elected officials. I think they are raising the conversation, theyre raising the discussion which is very real and very legitimate. And at this point, its a moot point in regard to the fact -- @!MILLER : Right. But they do nt like because it does nt hurt poor people enough. @!WALL : Thats just -- thats rhetoric. @!MILLER : Not tax cuts for the rich. They love those. @!BEHAR : You know, Tara, you have to admit theyre concerned about the unemployment benefits going on, but to add to the deficit, but tax relief for the rich, they do nt seem to be concerned about that. She does make the point. @!WALL : Listen, the concern about the tax for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, that bar has changed from one level to the next over the past two years under the current administration. @!MILLER : The average income in the United States is 44,000. $250,000 is rich. @!WALL : If you let me finish my thought. I did nt interrupt you, so let me finish my thought. I think when we talk about the wealthy, youre talking about a span of people that includes small business owners, that include black farmers, that include people who feel like theyre getting pinched out of the system. And it still does not do anything to address the very real issues that we had with our current tax code -- @!MILLER : But the senate voted down -- @!WALL : And the presidents own bipartisan commission talked about how convoluted it is. @!MILLER : Chuck Schumer put forth a compromise up to $1 million a year. Republicans voted that down. Its not enough. Nothing is enough for them. Theyve got to protect the very, very rich. @!WALL : First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about, pay the bulk of taxes, pay the fair share, more than the fair share of taxes in this country, over 60 percent, almost 60 percent of taxes. @!BEHAR : Tara, what do you say to people - @!WALL : I do nt think thats a fair system. I think what Republicans, what conservatives are talking about, are a fairer, more flatter system -- @!MILLER : Youre making( ph) the most historically low tax rates we have. @!BEHAR : Tara, stop it. @!WALL : Its your show, Joy, go ahead. @!BEHAR : Just let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. What do you say to people that the very, very rich, their money really does nt circulate in the country and does nt really get the economy going, whereas people who are collecting unemployment insurance put it back into the system? People who make under $250,000 spend their money. The very rich do nt spend their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to that? @!WALL : I say, the more you tax them, the less that theyre going to spend. I think thats part of the problem. @!BEHAR : Really? @!WALL : Yes, really. Really. I think thats part of the problem. I think when you put a tax on someone who is contributing to society, it causes them to hold back. I think when you also feed into a system that is not fair, it is contributing -- @!WALL : Yes. That is the question. Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs, and why are we also rewarding those who do nt even pay into the tax system at all? It is not a fair system. If we had a flat tax -- whats wrong with a flat tax? Then, everybody pays their fair share. @!BEHAR : Thats not fair. @!WALL : Whats wrong with that? @!BEHAR : A flat tax, I do nt think, is fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It should be graduated because then people are jus t paying the same amount. The rich are paying the same amount as the poor. Its not really fair. @!WALL : Sure it is. @!BEHAR : The rich should pay more, do nt you think? @!WALL : If youre making more 50 and 10 percent of 50,000 versus 10 percent of 5,000, thats a much fairer system than the small percentage of people paying 60 percent of taxes. @!MILLER : If youre making 40 grand a year, you cant afford 25 percent. @!WALL : Its a hypothetical. @!BEHAR : We have to take a break. Well be back in a minute with more of this political panel. @!BEHAR : Im back with my political panel. Michael Moore announced yesterday that he was posting 20,000 of his own money to help bail out WikiLeaks founder, Assange, who is in custody on suspicion of rape. Well, Rush Limbaugh got wind( ph) of this and not so surprisingly had something to yell about. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a bunch of high- minded people out there on the left. You know, the no labels crowd coming out of the woodwork and pay the bail of the serial rapist, Julian Assange. Who knew that they were such fans of serial rapist out there, my friends? Of course, they would help a thousand rapists if it would mean one America hater might go free. @!BEHAR : OK. You know, Tara, he s calling him a serial rapist. He has nt really been convicted of anything yet. Isnt he innocent until proven guilty, just asking? @!WALL : Well, yes. He is innocent until proven guilty. @!BEHAR : OK. Well, then, what is he yelling about? And why does he say - specifically, he goes he -- he should say he when he says, they would help a thousand rapists, it would mean that one American hater might go free. Whos they? Who are the theys? Id like to hear who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire left wing of the country like that. Stephanie, does nt that offend you? I find it offensive. @!MILLER : Yes. I thought it was just given were all serial rapist lovers, Joy. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!MILLER : You know, and secondly, as you said, there has nt been a trial, but you know, what the word is that his condom broke, which is whats considered a sex crime in that country. So, its hardly -- I mean, its a different kind of WikiLeak is all Im saying. Were talking about here, but, you know, I find it amazing. They want to execute this guy or maybe invade a country to get him, Joy, you know, back when they were leaking Valerie Plames identity. You know, leaking classified stuff wasnt so bad, I guess. And now, its, you know, worthy of executing someone without a trial. @!WALL : Whos the they in this case? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Im talking about the right wing. @!MILLER : He s not even an American citizen. Theyre saying we should invade a country that he s in. Where were you when, you know, they were leaking classified information about Valerie Plame? @!WALL : I think that, you know, the collective obviously, you know, Rush Limbaugh is taking liberties at the collective day as he does most of the time with his show. You know, I think the appalling view here should be why Michael Moore, you know, wanted to make this obvious statement by bailing out what could be potentially a rapist, an alleged rapist. So, that is a very real issue. And if you want to talk about the " they, " where are they, the liberal feminists or any feminists from the right or the left that are out talking about how serious an issue this could be, should this man be found guilty of a very, very serious crime, and the alleged victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have assaulted. @!MILLER : Could have, may have or he could have been set up because he s leaking information a lot of people do nt want out there. @!WALL : He was arrested. He was in jail. And I think its a very serious issue that shouldnt be made light of. @!BEHAR : I think that Michael is probably contributing money for the freedom of information. I think thats where he s at. @!MILLER : Yes. @!BEHAR : I mean, maybe the guy is a rapist, well find out, and then, well go after him. @!BEHAR : One a time. @!WALL : What message does that send to his -- to his alleged victim? What message does that send to his alleged victim, whatever statement -- @!WALL : About WikiLeaks or anything otherwise? @!BEHAR : Well, I would like to know if the guy is guilty -- @!MILLER : He has nt been convicted yet. And his point is we might have avoided the Iraq war if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information that was true has been out there at the time. @!WALL : I think a potential rape kind of trumps that right now. @!BEHAR : OK. Got to go. Im going to go to black. Thank you very much, ladies. You were terrific. Goodnight, everybody.
