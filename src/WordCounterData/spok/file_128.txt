244741 @!CONTENT : BRIAN WELLS, BOB RUDGE, MARY BETH BUCHANAN, KENNETH BARNES, MARJORIE DIEHL-ARMSTRONG, PNC BANK ROBBERY @!MARTIN-BASHIR-@1AB# @(Off-camera) Good evening. According to the latest statistics, there are 20 bank robberies every day across the United States. That 's 7,000 per year, and the number is rising. FBI figures for the last year show that bank robberies were up 5% from the previous year. But few of these crimes are quite as mysterious as the one we focus on tonight. It was a horrifying case that seemed to end with the death of an ordinary, innocent man, a pizza deliveryman. But today, a US attorney, who spent four years investigating the case, said he was no victim. He was actually a coconspirator. Here 's ' Nightline 's " Chris Bury. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) What happened that August afternoon in 2003 set in motion a bizarre and brutal mystery. Police in Eerie, Pennsylvania had captured and handcuffed Brian Wells, a mild-mannered, middle-aged pizza deliveryman. Earlier that day, he dropped a pizza off near this television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, about an hour later, Wells, a 46-year-old who lived quietly by himself, had inexplicably robbed a bank. @GRAPHICS @!WITNESS-@1MALE@2-# I 'm calling about that bank robbery at PNC Bank Summit Towne Plaza. 911 DISPATCHER( FEMALE) Yeah, what happened? @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Witnesses who called 911 had noticed something strange. @!WITNESS-@1MALE@2-# A guy just walked out with, I do n't know how much cash in a bag. He had a bomb or something, or something wrapped around his neck. 911 DISPATCHER( FEMALE) You saw him with a bomb or whatever it was? @!WITNESS-@1MALE@2-# @!Yes-He's-got-it-st# @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Indeed, around his neck, a steel collar that Wells insisted was attached to a bomb. He told police another man had locked it and ordered him to complete the bank robbery and hand over the money on a certain deadline or else. You can hear Wells just barely explain as he pleads with police. @!BRIAN-WELLS-@1CO-C# I 'm not lying. It 's gon na go off. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) As the seconds ticked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary police waited more than 30 minutes for the bomb squad to arrive. A curious crowd gathered. Local news crews staked out the surreal scene. @!POLICE-OFFICER-@1M# How close can you zoom in with that? @!CAMERAMAN-@1MALE@2# We 're live. @!POLICE-OFFICER-@1M# @!No-We-need-you-to-# @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) What police did not know then was revealed later in a mysterious note that Wells carried telling him, quote, ' This powerful booby-trapped bomb can be removed only by following our instructions. " When police stopped him, Wells had less than an hour to follow his orders. Nonetheless, as the countdown continued, he appeared relatively calm. @!BRIAN-WELLS-@1CO-C# Call my boss? @!CAMERAMAN-@1MALE@2# State police are urging us to move... @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Just as the news crews were setting up for a live report, their cameras momentarily turned away, they heard the explosion. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) The blast had blown a hole in the chest of Brian Wells, killing him instantly. By now, the bomb squad had arrived. An officer approached gingerly, fearing, perhaps, another device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none turned up. At first, investigators focused on a homemade gun disguised as a cane found in Wells ' car. That unusual note detailing exactly what steps Wells was supposed to take after the robbery and of course, that strange metal contraption that had been locked around his neck. @!BOB-RUDGE-@1FBI-SP# I think it 's important to think of these behavioral characteristics as like parts of a jigsaw puzzle. You do not have to have every single piece of the puzzle to determine the picture. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Off-camera) But there were so many pieces to the puzzle. To begin, was Brian Wells an innocent victim or part of the plot? Who else might have been involved? Was the real motive money or some kind of sinister game? Questions that have gone largely unanswered for nearly four years until today. @!MARY-BETH-BUCHANAN# We have worked nonstop to develop the evidence to identify the participants and their roles in this extremely bizarre crime. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) A federal prosecutor laid out what she called an evil scheme that had been carefully choreographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' intention to have it seem as though the person wearing the explosive device was a hostage. This was done by making it appear that he had to follow a series of instructions in order to successfully rob the bank, deliver the money to the coconspirators and deactivate the collar bomb. It was part of the plan also that if the robber died, he could not be a witness against the other coconspirators. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) The indictment named Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, already serving up to 20 years for killing a boyfriend to silence him, prosecutors contend, because he knew about the bomb plot. Also accused as a fellow ringleader is Kenneth Barnes, now locked up on drug charges. Through their lawyers, they denied today 's allegations. Other alleged conspirators have since died. But what about Brian Wells, the pizza deliveryman killed by the bomb? @!MARY-BETH-BUCHANAN# Unfortunately, our investigation has led to the belief that Brian became involved in a limited role with a group of individuals who planned to rob the PNC Bank. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him dying that day, but we do know, unfortunately, that Brian participated in a limited role in the planning and then in the carrying out of this robbery. Sadly, the plans of these other individuals were much more sinister with Brian 's. Much more sinister. And he died as a result. @GRAPHICS @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Since the murder, his family has campaigned on this website to clear the name of a man they described as the ' innocent victim of a terrorist attack. " @!JOHN-WELLS-@1BROTH# This whole case has been unbelievable from, from the beginning. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) This afternoon, John Wells could not contain his anger over the new allegations that his murdered brother was in on the plot that would ultimately kill him. @!JOHN-WELLS-@1BROTH# My brother was not involved before. He was n't involved in the bank robbery. He was n't involved in the planning in the bank robbery. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Prosecutors insist that Wells met with the masterminds of the plot the day before the bank robbery, though they concede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that during the course of this robbery, that he did express a strong willingness not to participate. And, and this bomb was forcibly put on his neck. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Brian was a victim, not a criminal, his brother argued today. @!JOHN-WELLS-@1BROTH# I do n't think he knew, he did not know any of these people. That 's why they had to lure him to the - tower to clamp the bomb on him. @!REPORTER-@1FEMALE@# And do you think he just went there and they - took him hostage... @!JOHN-WELLS-@1BROTH# They grabbed him at, as she said, they grabbed him at gunpoint. @!CHRIS-BURY-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) The full explanation of that awful August afternoon may not become clear until all the evidence is offered at trial. But one essential mystery remains. Was the man who died that day truly a willing participant or merely an innocent pawn? This is Chris Bury for ' Nightline " in Washington. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-#
