5002541 @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : So here 's a question for you. Should women be crying more at work and shunning Botox fillers and other methods designed to hide their age? And is all of this, in part, the key to true equality in the workplace? Jennifer Palmieri learned a few life lessons during her years of working in politics, most recently as the communications director for Hillary Clinton 's 2016 presidential race. As the highest-ranking woman in that campaign, she clearly knows a thing or two about female empowerment. She has detailed her advice, along with some personal moments from the political trail, in a new book, Dear Madam President : An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World. Please welcome Jennifer Palmieri. Hi. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 @5Dear-Madam-President@6 : Hi. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Okay. So when I first got this book, I thought, oh, gosh, this is going to be a long book about why Hillary lost and it was n't justified. And it was n't that. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Right. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : It was n't. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single word and thought I 've never read a book like this in my life from a strong, powerful woman with real-life practical advice to other women on real challenges that are there whether we want to admit them or not. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Is that why you wrote it? @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : I wrote it because I thought that coming out of that campaign, right, you -- I felt like I had a very unique perspective and some insight about how we think about women and leadership roles. And I had been myself as a woman in politics and, you know, worked in two White Houses, I 've seen how people operate at the highest levels of government, highest levels of power. And, you know, want people to know, it 's not as hard as you might think and you can do it. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Even a reality star can do it. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Evidently, anyone, Megyn, can be president. And I wanted -- I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowerment, right? Women weirdly feel empowered in this moment. And I want to make sure that we make the most of that. I saw, you know, yesterday there was Martin Luther King 's granddaughter, Yolanda, who spoke at the march this weekend and she was so amazing, just nine years old. And like all little girls, she has -- she was joyful and fearless and like had all the confidence in the world. And I want this generation that 's coming up now not to lose that, right? At some point -- like little girls had all that confidence and then at some point they learned to be inhibited. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Because all of society sends them messaging on it. It 's not just -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : -- if you have great parents you wo n't grow up that way. Society is sending girls the wrong messages. But I want to -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : And that 's what -- and that 's like what I want -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is that -- is how to unlearn those things so the next generation, they really do run the world as girls. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : But there 's very good practical advice in here which we 're going to get to, including the stuff about crying. But first, let me ask you about Hillary and Donald Trump. I thought it was interesting the day after she lost you wrote, " What I felt was fear. " How do you feel now? @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : I -- I 'm so -- there are things I 'm still frightened for the country but I do n't feel -- I think that it is -- it felt to me like a different universe and that 's why I wrote about it as starkly as I did in the book because I want people to understand it is -- I felt it might not have been a glass ceiling that shattered that night but something exploded. And I feel like we were in a new universe and I found that really frightening in the beginning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empowered. And I think that women could decide after -- you know, it 's not so much about politics, even or about Hillary versus Trump, but just that the woman lost, a man like Trump won, and you could decide that 's how it 's supposed to be or we 've been playing by the wrong set of rules and we are going to play a whole new game now. And so that 's like the book is about how do you -- how do you make the most of that sense of empowerment and do it play be -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : We 've seen some of that with the -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : -- and we play by your own set of rules. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : -- with the #MeToo movement and so on. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yes. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : A lot of people believe that would n't have happening had Trump not been elected. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : I think that 's right. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : I do want to -- I want to challenge you on this. You wrote, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deleting the e-mails lay the fundamental truth that there was something about Hillary Clinton that folks just did n't trust, " which I think is true. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : But then you say, " And that something was an intelligent, capable, ambitious woman in a position of power. " Having covered the race very closely for all that time, I would submit to you, it was so much more than that. There 's no question sexism played a role in her defeat. But I watched her at that U.N. press conference when she first addressed those e-mails and she said several, several things that were not true, Jen, as you know. There was no classified information. I only used one device for -- out of convenience which did n't turn out to be true. There was tons of classified information, a hundred and ten e-mails, classified or top secret and so on. And these things kept unraveling and it led to a distrust that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitewater and all of these other things. But you ca n't ascribe even the majority of it to sexism, can you, fairly? @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : So the way I look at it is I think that a man would have survived that, okay? And I think that there was going to be something in the campaign that ended up to be e-mails. If it were n't e- mails, it was going to be something else. And I think this is what the first woman, the sort of crucibles is what they had to go through or she had to go through. I went back and watched interviews about Hillary Clinton and of Hillary Clinton from the ' 92 campaign, right? And, you know, what people say -- what do you think of Clinton 's wife? Man on the street in most interviews, you know, there 's something about her I just do n't like. There 's something about her I just do n't trust. And I thought, wow. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I am not solving this problem. This is before Whitewater. This is before Travelgate. This is before anything in the White House. This is before e-mails, health care, anything. And I think that she has always been -- she 's always challenged the way we 've thought about women from when she was a young college student -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : That 's true. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : -- to when she was Bill Clinton 's wife who is running for president. She made more money than him. She did n't stay home and bake cookies. She was the first first lady that works in policy -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : But she got in trouble because she sounded judgmental of those who did. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yes. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : And that could be the thing people did n't like, you know, the judgment. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : And that is -- and that is -- but that 's my point is she 's always been that. She 's always been stepping a little outside of that box. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people -- she vexes them. They do n't know what to think of her. And what I found with reporters on e-mails is the question just kept moving. The goalposts kept moving. And it 's just -- fundamentally, I think there 's just something they found suspicion in a woman looking to succeed. And it does n't mean that the whole world is sexist -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : No, or that everybody who voted for Trump is sexist. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : -- or everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or that everybody who does it -- you know, there 's plenty of fine reasons to not vote for her. But I think -- I want -- I think it 's worth going back and looking at that so we understand what lays at the root of that. And it 's like T-S-A-H-I-J-D-L, there 's something about her I just do n't like. And you hear it all the time about women in powerful positions. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Well, listen. Even if you disagree with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female president. We 'll wait. We 'll wait. We 'll be sitting here after the break. And why is that? Is it because there has n't been a talented or smart or ambitious enough one since the beginning of time? Doubtful. Listen, when we come back, we 're going to talk about some of the life lessons that Jennifer wants women everywhere to know, like, this is a great one, saying yes to crying at work, why that may work for you, next. @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6 @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : We 're back now with Jennifer Palmieri who served as communications director for Hillary Clinton 's 2016 presidential bid. She 's also served under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and she details some of the lessons learned in her new book, Dear Madam President : An Open Letter to the Women Who Will Run the World. This is from a woman who knows what it 's like to advise powerful people and work among powerful people. One of the things you say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise, you do n't panic. You show no emotion. I can handle this. I can handle anything. This is what we say to ourselves. For me and a lot of women, you write, it 's a toxic brew of the need to prove we 're tough enough to play a man 's game combined with a woman 's sense of duty. And you go on to suggest we need to nod less -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yes. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : -- and cry more. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Right. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Why? @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Because I think those -- that 's the two behaviors that I think hold us, that inhibit us. So we -- you know how people talk about superwomen? I think that means people -- when people say that, they mean I want a woman to do everything I expect of her, plus she gets to do what she wants on the side. And it 's like, no, you get to embrace all of your emotions and -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that makes us beautiful, makes us beautiful -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : -- our connection with our emotions as women. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : And the -- we -- if I had n't -- during the Clinton campaign, we heard a lot of crazy stuff and every day I would hear some crazy -- I just nod. I 'm like okay. I can handle that. I can handle that. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : But you could n't be there blubbering all day either. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : No. So I -- @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Hillary would have been like what 's up with Palmieri. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah, yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : what 's going on? Get it together girl. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : So you have to -- you just -- you know, it 's like how would it be if instead of nodding every time I said, you know what, that 's crazy, we 're not going to survive that or you know what, that 's crazy, we 're not going to do that. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just think about with crying, it 's like the greatest sin in the workplace that a woman can commit. And I am easily moved to tears. And I think when something moves you to tears, that means it 's important. When I will -- sometimes tear up when I talk about something that 's important to me and we should be able to -- we should be able to do that. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : Let it fly. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. You should not mute everything that makes you feel passion. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : It makes you unique. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Yeah. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : What about -- you talk about how -- I love this. You love your face and you own -- you own your face. You said, " I decided years ago I did n't want all that I lived and learned to be smoothed over. Look at my face. It tells you I was a child in the seventies. I am your connection to that time. I can tell you the songs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like in that moment and I hope society eases up on the pressure for each of us to look young. " @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Young. And like yes. It 's exhausting. And it 's like this -- these are the things we have to unlearn is that I think your face -- faces are valuable in ways well beyond what they -- how they appear and whether or not they are attractive. And I love that my face tells you -- I think you -- my face tells you something about the life that I lived. And I 've always found comfort in older women 's faces. It tells you they 've been through a lot and they have survived. And you can see there 's stress lines and worry lines but you manage to have a smile on your face anyway. And I think that 's -- we need to feel more connected to each other. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : My face tells you I work in an industry that 's extremely vain and I cave to the pressure. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have to tell you, I have never read a book like this with so many good life lessons on what we 're up against. But she tells it straight. And it 's -- I believe 2016 has a message for women about where we really stand and that 's better to know. It 's better -- @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : It is. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : -- to know what reality is than to operate in some false utopia. That 's the way forward. A lot of pearls of wisdom in this. Truly, honestly recommend it. Thank you so much for coming on and talking about it. @1JENNIFER-PALMIERI@2 : Oh, thank you. @1MEGYN-KELLY@2 : We 'll be right back. Coming up, do you believe in heaven and hell? One bishop who says his life was forever changed when he started spreading a message he says he got directly from God. Our leap of faith, next. @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6
