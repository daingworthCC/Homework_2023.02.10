229641 @!HUME : The FOX all-stars are here. First THE BELTWAY BOYS, two days short of the premier of their broadcast, Fred Barnes, executive editor of " The Weekly Standard, " joined by Mort Kondracke, executive editor of " Roll Call, " and from the White House, indoors, I trust -- yes -- Mara Liasson, White House correspondent for National Public Radio, standing where Mike McCurry often stands. Mara, I suppose -- is it not fair to say that we would have heard this announcement long ago had not the Monica Lewinsky case come along? @!MARA-LIASSON-NATI : Yeah, I think that 's... @!HUME : That Mike was leaving? @!LIASSON : I think that is fair to say. I think he 's wanted to leave for many, many months. He actually had planned to leave before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke in January. As a matter of fact, there were several White House officials, top White House officials, who had been planning to leave. But Mike is a very loyal soldier, and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship or abandoning the president at his most vulnerable moment, and he decided to stay. And he had made it known privately for some time that the fall would and then this week the president offered the job to his deputy, which was something that was also in the works for a very long time. And the president actually scooped the press today. He did manage to make the announcement before we all had put it in the papers and on the air. @!HUME : Mara, McCurry did some things that I think it 's -- a lot of people felt nobody else could have gotten away with. @!LIASSON : Absolutely. @!HUME : Principally, this approach that he could n't answer any questions... @!LIASSON : Right. @!HUME :... about the Lewinsky case because he had deliberately chosen not... @!LIASSON : Right. @!HUME :... as he put it, to be a fact-finder. In other words, chosen to be in the dark. @!LIASSON : That 's right. He had -- he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president. He seemed to have a lot of information at his fingertips. He was very well-briefed on almost every substantive issue that you could ask him about. But when it came to the scandal, he said he did n't want to know, he was n't going to know. And I think he was one of the few people who could have gotten away with that. He set up a separate scandal structure, a separate scandal press secretary, and I think it 's a measure of the good will he had generated on the part of the press corps that he could get away with this.( crosstalk) @!MORT-KONDRACKE- " R : There does seem to be a -- there are two cones( ph) at the White House, as the bureaucrats would put it. One is the scandal gang, which is John Podesta, the deputy White House chief of staff, the counsel 's office and their spokesman, who has been Lanny Davis and various other people. Then there 's... @!HUME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't he.( crosstalk) @!LIASSON : We 're on our third one now. @!KONDRACKE : Then there 's the business gang, which is Erskine Bowles, the regular White House chief of staff, and, you know, all the policy functionaries and Mike McCurry as their spokesman. And they seem to @!FRED-BARNES- " THE- : You know, McCurry -- McCurry, who I like very much -- I 've known him for years on all the campaigns he was involved in. He worked for Senator... @!HUME : Let 's go back through that. He was -- I first knew him when he was on, I guess, Harrison Williams, the... @!BARNES : Yeah. @!HUME : In fact, he was being -- he was driven from office by scandal... @!BARNES : Right. Right. @!HUME :... back in the ' 70s and... @!HUME : He did. the... @!HUME : Senator... @!BARNES :... Senator Moynihan 's press secretary. Then in ' 84, he was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 88 with Bruce Babbitt, his campaign. In between, he did things. He was DNC chairman, I guess, after Babbitt. Then he was press secretary to the Democratic National Committee. @!HUME : And then in ' 92... @!BARNES : In ' 92, he became -- remember, he was Bob Kerrey 's spokesman, when he was running against Bill Clinton, and so there was great resistance inside the Clinton White House to giving him any job in the Clinton administration. But finally, he became the spokesman for the State Department, and then, of course, was brought over a year later to... @!HUME : Now, Mara... @!LIASSON : But you know, the point that Fred makes is one of the reasons he was so effective. He was n't a member of the Clinton inner circle. He was n't a die-hard loyalist. So even when he was spinning you, it was n't that kind of overwhelming kind of hard-edged spin that you did get from George Stephanopoulos... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, and I think the fact that he had worked for Clinton 's opponents helped. @!HUME : I must tell you, though, that the mail that we get in here, some of which comes from people who do n't care much for Mr. Clinton, does not indicate that the distinction that they -- that we are articulating here between Mike McCurry and the Clintons... @!LIASSON : Maybe after... @!HUME :... was visible to them.( crosstalk) Well, there 's something else there, is n't there, Mara, that has to do with the public McCurry dealing with a room full of press in a briefing, and the McCurry that you would talk to... @!LIASSON : Sure. @!HUME :... in other settings, correct? Describe. @!LIASSON : Oh, absolutely. And look, that 's what a press secretary 's job is. It is n't just giving the briefings, it 's also talking to reporters on background or off the record, on the phone, and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press corps came to feel was candid to us and loyal to his boss. And he managed to strike that balance. It 's a very hard balance to strike. It 's kind of ephemeral, but it was in those private background conversations where he was more candid. @!BARNES : And he 'd even return the phone calls of people like myself, very good. He was indispensable. But you know what he 's going to be remembered for? Here 's what he did as press secretary in public. That had been generally a defensive role. You 'd ward off the attacks and you 'd release information and so on. He turned it into an offensive position, where he would go on offense, against Congressional Republicans, sparing Bill Clinton the job of doing that. And he was very, very effective. He would zing Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich and all of them, and they ought to be relieved that Mike McCurry 's not going to be there anymore because he always got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. @!KONDRACKE : A total pro. I mean, somebody that the press trusted because of this background role because he would talk frankly, pretty candidly, and occasionally zing some of even people in the White House on background, off the record, you know, not to be -- not for attribution. And then he could go out in public, and he got a lot of leeway from the press on things... @!LIASSON : Yeah... @!KONDRACKE :... like not -- you know, not -- purposely not knowing what he was supposed to know. @!LIASSON : Yeah, it 's a real tightrope act, and I think people underestimate how difficult it is to pull that off. @!HUME : All right, now... @!BARNES : Well, he did have that -- that one famous line, I think to the Chicago " Tribune, " that if there was an innocent explanation... @!LIASSON : Right, he would have already given it. @!BARNES :... for President Clinton about Monica Lewinsky, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well, I mean, that was one of those thing where, if you think about it, that 's almost self-evidently true, and -- but it did have a lot of -- it did reverberate when he said it. Let 's take a look over at Janet Reno today, who had a public briefing, or what passes for a briefing at the Department of Justice, in which she says some interesting things about this report she now has from Mr. Labella, who was her hand-picked man to run this campaign finance investigation, who has now joined Louis Freeh in saying, " You need to She seemed to suggest today that because he was head of the investigation, it does not give him any special extra -- his advice any special extra weight. What 's going on here? @!KONDRACKE : Well, she says she 's looking it over. Basically, she counsel on this " Chinagate " investigation. And apparently, no evidence -- not the FBI director, not her special prosecutor -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now, next week she 's going to get a going over from Dan Burton, the infamous chairman of the Government Operations Committee in the House...( crosstalk) @!HUME :... celebrated. @!KONDRACKE : Celebrated. Well, you know, he 's just notorious, I think. @!BARNES : I knew that was coming! " Notorious. " @!KONDRACKE : And he 's going to beat her up, you know, but she 's been beaten up by the best of them, and she refuses to yield. @!BARNES : I know, but there 's really no reason why she should n't name alternative to it. Well, the alternative is stubbornness on her part, and maybe she 's not doing this to curry favor with the Clinton White House, but this is the one thing, by not naming one now, it keeps the White House off her back. @!HUME : Now, Mara, is it possible that she 's missing something here, in the sense that one of the reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigations where they 'd be seen as having conflicts of interest... @!LIASSON : Sure. @!HUME :... and the damage that does to the attorney general 's credibility, and potentially to that of the Department of Justice? @!LIASSON : Oh, that 's exactly what Louis Freeh has been arguing to her for months and months unsuccessfully, that it 's supposed to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. That 's one of the reasons to trigger it, even if some of the other criteria are n't there. But so far, even though I think the pressure is building, really, to an incredible degree on her, she seems impervious to all of it. @!HUME : All right, let 's take it around here. Mort, do you think she will continue to resist it? @!KONDRACKE : I think she will, and I might say that I have been in outfit of investigators ca n't go after Republicans, who also violated the campaign finance laws -- not as egregiously as the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it will look like bias, and they should @!BARNES : And no, she wo n't, because since her position is irrational, she will not accept reason. @!HUME : Well, Mara, what do you think? You think she 's finally this time have to do it? she was going to have to do it, but so far she does n't look like she 's buckling, so I do n't -- I think it 's going to have to take some other new evidence or new form of pressure. @!HUME : All right, that 's the last word on that, Mara. We got a little something else coming up after this next commercial that you do n't want to miss. Stick around. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!HUME : And finally, Democratic Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware speaks with such force it can be fascinating just to watch him talk. We take you now to a news conference in the Capitol, where he was lamenting what he considers the Republican political motives behind the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hear, his Democratic colleague, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, interrupts with a well-timed wisecrack. Listen. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!JOSEPH-BIDEN-@1D@2 : Why did they pick it, out of the 16 important things? Why 'd they pick that? What do you think? They picked it because the polling data shows overwhelmingly the public wants access! Next : " Access to OB-GYN. " Women, folks, women. W-O-M-E-N, women. They do n't want to fool around with the women. And what does every woman in America say? @!BARBARA-MIKULSKI-@ : Some do, Joe. @!BIDEN : Yeah? I do n't! @!HUME : All right. And that 's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT. Join us next time.
