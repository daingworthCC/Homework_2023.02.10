4172441 @!JOHN-MACKEY# Venture capitalists are like hitchhikers with credit cards. And as long as you take them to where they want to go, they will help you pay for the gas. But if you do n't take them where they want to go, they will try to hijack the car and throw you out on the side of the road. So I did not trust the VCs. I liked them. I did n't trust them. I did not want them to take control of the company, so I thought we 're going to go public and then we 're going to get the hitchhikers out of the car. @!GUY-RAZ# From NPR, it 's HOW I BUILT THIS, a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists and the stories behind the movements they built. @!GUY-RAZ# I 'm Guy Raz. And on today 's show, how life in a vegetarian commune inspired John Mackey to start Whole Foods and with it, an organic food revolution that changed the way Americans shop for groceries. @!GUY-RAZ# If you happened to step into an organic food co-op in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk past aisles and aisles of bulk bins full of beans and brown rice and dried fruit. There were no big brands, no Stonyfield Farms or Nature 's Path, no Amy 's or Annie 's. And the people who shopped in the stores, they were among a teeny tiny handful of Americans who even knew what quinoa or kale were. And they were mostly counterculture types, hippies, back to nature folks, my mom. And yet, all of these people were at the leading edge of a food revolution that would start to sweep the country in the 1990s. And that revolution was largely propelled by Whole Foods. And even though that company inspires pretty strong opinions - you 've got the fanboys and the haters - there 's no denying that it 's had a monster-sized impact on the way we eat. But the person who is partly responsible for this revolution? Well, here is what John Mackey grew up eating. @!JOHN-MACKEY# I would start the day with Cocoa Puffs and milk, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I mean, hamburgers for lunch with nothing on it, certainly no vegetables on the hamburgers. Maybe fried chicken for dinner or macaroni and cheese out of a can or a box. @!GUY-RAZ# Yum. @!JOHN-MACKEY# This was the era where stay-home moms were so thrilled about the great innovations that could happen like TV dinners. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# You could - frozen TV dinners that you could just pop in the oven and voila, you 'd have a meal for your family. @!GUY-RAZ# Where were you in life when you first discovered food, like, real food? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. My food consciousness awakening really occurred when I was about 23. And I moved into this vegetarian co-op in Austin called Prana House. I was definitely interested in the counterculture. I 'm - I thought I 'd meet interesting women as well, so I thought it was a - I was an adventurer. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# I expanded my diet tremendously. I did become a vegetarian. Then I became the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a job. And I went to work for a small natural food store in Austin called the Good Food Company. And wow, I 'd like - I was launched on my path. I loved everything about natural and organic foods. I liked cooking. I liked retailing it. And I thought this is something I could really be passionate about. @!GUY-RAZ# OK. At this point in your life, you did not like - you did n't have a college degree, right? You kind of dropped out of college. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. So when I was about 20 years old, I was on track to get a degree in philosophy from the University of Texas, but I ran into a course that was a required course that I needed to complete. I did n't like the course. I did n't like the books that I was required to read. I did n't like the professor. And then one day the battle was over, and I stood up and the book I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground. I said, I 'm not going to read this book. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And then I just began to read books and take courses that I was interested in. So I ended up with 120 hours of electives that were just courses I was interested in, but I took control of my life. I began to be authentic and true to myself. And that led me into this whole natural food world. @!GUY-RAZ# So when you - when you - so you show up into this co-op. You do n't have a college degree. It 's - I 'm assuming it 's kind of like a hippie type of place, right? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. It was definitely a - it was a hippie place. @!GUY-RAZ# So your parents are super excited and proud of the decisions you 've made at this point in your life at 23? @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. My parents were very worried, very unhappy. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# The very last conversation I ever had with my mother in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to school and make something of myself. And I was a grocer. I was a hippie grocer. And I - she said, I know you have a fine mind, John, why are you wasting it as a grocer? Go be a doctor or a lawyer, or do something with your life that makes a difference. And I said, I 'm doing something with my life that makes a difference. She said, you 're just a grocer. And I said, Mom, grocers are great( laughter). @!GUY-RAZ# So what was it like? Like, what was it like working at that health food store? @!JOHN-MACKEY# I loved it. I mean, the store was n't very big. It was only a couple thousand square feet, but the retail business was really fun. I mean, first of all, I 'm surrounded by food, which I 'm fascinated by, with other people that I 'm working with. You know, there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're also equally interested in food. They 're people that you get to know over time in a small store with not, you know, not that many customers. And you develop relationships with people and you serve them. And I just thought that was, like, super fun. I knew I can do this. This seems within my realm of competence. And then I 'd worked there about six months. And when I - some - an idea grew in my mind which is this is what I want to do with my life. I want to open - I want to open my own store. I went back to the co-op and talked to my girlfriend Renee. She was four years younger than me, so I was like 23 and she was like 19. And she got super excited about it. I often wondered if Renee had said that 's a stupid idea, it 'll never work, how my life might be different now. But she was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening our own store. @!GUY-RAZ# So how did you even - how 'd you even get started? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, that was n't easy. I make a joke about it now that an entrepreneur is a little bit like a panhandler except that they 're selling dreams to people. And we raised the money because we - like most entrepreneurs, friends and family. We thought we needed $50,000 to start the store. And we could only come up with 45, but we decided we could make do with it. And my initial stake was $10,000. That 's the most I ever owned of the company, and - 10 of the 45,000. And I 'd borrowed all of that from my father. @!GUY-RAZ# So with that money, you were able to open up the first Whole Foods? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, the original store was called SaferWay, think Safeway but SaferWay. And truthfully, we were always hoping that maybe Safeway would sue us. It would be good publicity. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were business classes. No real business experience. Renee did n't have any experience. She was - by the time we opened the store, she was 20, 21. And we opened a store in an old house, not even on a busy road. It was just like - we just thought this was a super cool house, so we had a store on the first floor - a vegetarian store. And we had a vegetarian restaurant on the second floor, a cafe. And then we had an office, and we lived on the third floor. @!GUY-RAZ# If you were to walk through SaferWay, what would you see on the shelves? Was it like bulk products and, like, beans? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yep. @!GUY-RAZ# And was there meat? Was there sugar? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. No, there was - so we did n't - we were pretty pure. We did n't sell sugar. We did n't sell meat. We were selling real foods. We were selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hippie, but we had about - I do n't know - counting the people in the cafe, so a lot of them working part-time, we probably had 20 people working - 15 to 20 people. @!GUY-RAZ# So were you scared? I mean, you were still a kid. @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. I was n't scared at all. @!GUY-RAZ# You thought this was going to work? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, when you 're - you know, when you 're 24 or 25 years old, you do n't have so much to lose. I was n't married. I did n't have any kids. For my case, the worst case scenario was I would disappoint a lot of people and I 'd do something else in life. It did n't - for me, it was a grand adventure. Starting a business is fun. It 's fun because you 're engaged and you 're passionate about it. And the whole dream just sort of swept us along. We did n't know what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got better. @!GUY-RAZ# You must have burned through that 45,000 pretty fast. @!JOHN-MACKEY# We did. We actually lost half of it in the first year. @!GUY-RAZ# Oh, wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# We lost $23,000 the first year. @!GUY-RAZ# Were you freaking out? @!JOHN-MACKEY# No but the investors were. @!GUY-RAZ# I bet. Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# My dad was freaking out for sure. @!GUY-RAZ# I bet. @!JOHN-MACKEY# But I 'm - I just began to read books. I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I have read hundreds, possibly a thousand books on business since the beginning. I also - I 'm an entrepreneur, so I try things. But if something does n't work, I stop doing it. That enabled us to learn quickly. And we did make a small $5,000 profit in our second year. @!GUY-RAZ# And how did you do that? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Sort of managing our costs better. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# I started buying better, less spoilage, better management of labor hours. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know, and we had to figure it out. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. And who were your customers at SaferWay? Were they just like local hippies in Austin? Or did you also have like sort of, you know, Austin high society people? @!JOHN-MACKEY# So one of the jokes I tell is because I run into people all the time that tell me they were original SaferWay customers. And I say, you know, if half the people that said they were original SaferWay customers had been there, we never - we 'd of had five times the sales we ended up having. It 's kind of like the number of people that went to Woodstock, right? They 're... @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# But no, they were all young. These were people - this was the counterculture. And part of the counterculture was they wanted their own stores. They did n't want to go to the traditional big supermarkets. They were a very alien experience for them. @!GUY-RAZ# I mean, so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When did you start thinking about, you know, expanding? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, after about - when I began to make money the second year, I began to realize that SaferWay was too small. And I just thought we needed to have a bigger, better location. So I began to dream about opening a real grocery store where you could do all your shopping there. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# So we found this location. It was this old nightclub on a big strip road in Austin - Lamar - that it had burned down to the ground. It had been a nightclub. So I first had to try to sell our board on it and try to get more money. And they said this is crazy. You lost half the money the first year. And this is great, you 're making money now, but why do n't you just stay there for a few years and then, you know, we 'll see? It 's like no, we really to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get out-competed. We 're not well-positioned competitively. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# But they were n't buying it. And more or less they said look, we do n't want to put any more money in but maybe you could find somebody else to invest. Their strategy there being no one else would be stupid enough to invest in this company with this, you know, crazy entrepreneur who 's - has n't been successful yet. So I began to hustle anybody I knew that had money. I 'd already, you know, people that - new people I met. And there was a guy who was playing basketball with that one day we 'd finished playing pickup basketball. And he got into like a BMW and drove off. And he was the same age as I was. And I said, wow, what does Jay( ph) do? And they said, Jay does n't do anything. Jay 's a millionaire. He inherited a bunch of money from his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day. And it just turned out that Jay had had kind of his own food consciousness awakening and started shopping at SaferWay. He loved SaferWay. And Jay said he would put $50,000 in. And so I was like wow, OK, and went back to our board and said, I got a guy that 's going to put $50,000 in. And they were in shock. And several of them decided they wanted to kick more money in as well. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. So what happened? @!JOHN-MACKEY# So we rented that burned-out location. And the story there is also kind of interesting because the owner of that building was this guy named Ben Powell( ph). It had been in his family. He lives - he 's an attorney living in Houston at that time. And I had to go and sell him on doing this natural food supermarket in his building. I pitched him on it. And he started laughing kind of towards the end of my pitch. And I said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? And he said, John, I mean, this sounds like something you see in a movie, kind of a corny movie. He said, John, you are so full of enthusiasm. You think you can conquer the whole world. Well, life 's going to teach you different son, but you remind me of myself when I was young. Let 's do your got darn natural food supermarket. @!GUY-RAZ#( Laughter). @!JOHN-MACKEY# And so we were able to get that store open. However, while we were building it, one of the - my friendly competitors that had opened up after SaferWay - it was called Clarksville Natural Grocery. And I really loved the two entrepreneurs that were doing that, Craig Weller and Mark Skiles. I thought these are good guys. They work really hard. They got a good store. And I pitched them. Look. We 're going to open this natural foods supermarket, one of the first natural foods supermarkets anywhere in the world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't they join you instead of being competitors? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. Exactly. Join up. It 's going to be so much fun. By the way, if you do n't, we 're only a mile away from your site, your store. You 're going to - you know, you 're going to have trouble competing with us. @!GUY-RAZ# Wait. You told them - you basically said to them hey, this is going to be great. Let 's work together. And if you do n't, we 're going to crush you. @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. I did n't say it that way... @!GUY-RAZ# OK. @!JOHN-MACKEY#... Because - I mean, sometimes - funny thing is when I 've told this story, that 's how it gets interpreted in the media. @!GUY-RAZ# Oh, OK. I got you. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Of course I did n't threaten them. I mean, I said we 're only going to be a mile away. We 're going to have this big store. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Why do n't we do this together? @!GUY-RAZ# Did they have any of their own conditions? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. One of Craig 's and Mark 's conditions is we have to make this a real store. We have to sell meat. And we have to sell beer and wine. And we have to sell coffee. We ca n't just be completely a vegetarian idealistic store or we do n't want to partner with you. And I 'd already thought Craig and Mark 's store was very successful. And I talked to - a lot of the customers cross-shopped. And they all wanted us to loosen our product standards to make it more a real grocery store. And it was kind of like, you know, if we 're going to eat these foods, then we need to be able to - we should sell them. So that was a compromise that was made that turned out to be the right compromise from a business decision perspective. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And so the funny thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And they 'd come down after they 'd closed their store up and our store was being constructed. And then literally like two weeks before our store was set to open, they had seen enough and they said, we 're in. And so we had to really scramble to - now that we had to try to integrate our team members together. And we had to change the name. @!GUY-RAZ# And this is where - and I 'm assuming this is where Whole Foods is going to come in? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, we started with the name Market. We are a market. And then it was like what kind of market are - we 're a food market. What kind of food market are we? We 're kind of a natural foods market. Well, that seems kind of generic, ca n't call ourselves Natural Food Market. Well, we 're kind of an organic food market. Yeah, but we do n't have just organic. We ca n't call ourselves Organic Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling whole foods. And that was it, Whole Foods Market. @!GUY-RAZ# That was it. @!JOHN-MACKEY# That 's how we came up with our name. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And the store was an immediate success. People sometimes ask, how long did it take first Whole Foods Market to be successful? And the answer - true answer is it took till about 3 o'clock in the afternoon on the first day. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. Was that just because of luck, or was that just because of - there was this instant clamoring? @!JOHN-MACKEY# There 's always an element of luck in success in life. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# You know, we - one of the reasons I wanted to merge with those guys was not only because I liked them and thought they could help us, but I thought, you know what, if we can get Clarksville and SaferWay in here, we 'll have almost enough sales between the two stores to break even. And then if we get other customers, we 'll never look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this first store. It was amazing. And we did n't do any advertising, we just opened the doors. But the word of mouth was incredible. The whole Austin kind of counterculture hippie community knew about it immediately. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. And did it just keep going like that from that point on? @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. Like nine months after we opened - this is now in May of 1981 - Austin had the worst flood that it had had in about a hundred years. And our store was located in the hundred-year flood plain. So we were actually aware we were in the hundred-year flood plain. But when I said, well, what does that mean, they said, well, about every hundred years you 're going to have a flood. And I said, OK, I 'll take that chance. @!JOHN-MACKEY# it was a Sunday night. There had been a lot of rain during the weekend, but then it just really started to rain on Sunday. And I had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Renee started to call and said the water 's beginning to rise, you know, what do we do? And I said, take the bulk bags and pile them up in front of the doors inside the store. Because that 's where we thought the water would come in, through the doors. And actually, it kept the water out till it got up to about 4 feet. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# But that store was not designed to be a submarine. And so when the water got up to about 4 feet, the sheer weight of the water basically broke through the glass of the doors, and it just came in like a tidal wave. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Rene ended up swimming out of the store that night. And it was a Sunday. And we 'd had three days of sales that was in our floor safe. So I wanted to get the cash out of the store. And I went back. It was no lights. You got to picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's night. It 's - I 'm sloshing around in the back with a flashlight. And there are actually people wandering around the store, looters that were wandering around the store. And I went into the office, and I opened up the floor safe. I was able to pull the money out. This was a time when we did n't take - nobody took credit cards. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# More than half our money back then was just in cash. @!GUY-RAZ# Cash, yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# I mean, we had about $100,000. And I 'd put it all in this grocery bag. And I was wandering out the store. And this guy comes up to me. And he said, hey, buddy, did you find anything good in the back room? And I said, I 'm not sure, it 's dark. I just grabbed this bag. There 's probably something back there for you. Go check it out. And we got the money out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were pretty much out of business. There were cars floating down the street that we were watching float away. @!GUY-RAZ# In just a moment, after the flood and how John Mackey took Whole Foods from Austin to Boston and eventually to almost every state in America. I 'm Guy Raz, and you 're listening to HOW I BUILT THIS from NPR. @!GUY-RAZ# Hey, welcome back to HOW I BUILT THIS from NPR. I 'm Guy Raz. So it 's the spring of 1981, and John Mackey 's first Whole Foods store is literally underwater. It had only been open for six months, and they had no flood insurance. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And you got to picture what this store was like. This tidal wave of water had come in. And when you have a flood like that, all the sewage lines back up as well. So you have all this bulk food. And you - we had meat and fish and sewage. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And it was just a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we showed up for work. And we started cleaning everything up. And all those other people, I kind of recognized them but they were n't team members. I did n't - they were customers. We had customers and neighbors, and everybody was pitching in. @!GUY-RAZ# Oh, that 's cool. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And by all rights, Whole Foods should have died through that flood. And we had to rebuild the store. It was going to cost a lot of money to do that, and we just did n't have the money. So I thought - we all thought we were finished. But every one of the stakeholders rallied. There was a benefit held for the store. And the team members, they worked for free. Our bank loaned us money on my signature, which was worthless. And the investors decided to kick in more cash. So we were able to reopen 30 days later. That just pulled everybody together. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# We really united around that near-death experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just getting things in order? @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. I wanted to open a second store after the flood. @!GUY-RAZ# Oh, wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# It was like we ca n't put all of our eggs in a basket that might float down the river. We 've got to have a second store. The second store did n't - it did n't start as well as the first store. It was up in north Austin. And it was in the suburbs, kind of away from the counterculture community of Austin and was trying to market to more conventional, you know, suburban people. And it took a couple of years for that store to actually turn its first profit. And then we opened a third store in Austin, in South Boston. Now, that turned out to be very challenging for us because that store was too close to our original store and cannibalized it significantly. And together we started to lose money. @!GUY-RAZ# And did that, like, cause any tension with your partners? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the partners, Mark, he really did n't want to grow because we had this goldmine. He just wanted to mine it. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# So the long and short of it was that Mark sold his interest in the company and went into another direction in his life. So he was the first co-founder to exit. Actually, Renee exited slightly before him because she and I broke up. And she wanted to travel the world and see other places. So she got a new boyfriend, and she left. And doing a - starting a business together either brings you closer together or rips you apart. And in the case of Renee and I, it ended up ripping us apart. So then it was just Craig and I left. And a partnership is challenged when it gets into hard times. The good times are easy. @!GUY-RAZ# But did you ever - did you ever think to yourself maybe they 're right, maybe we expanded too quickly, maybe I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# I mean, I was regretting opening the south Austin store because, I mean, almost all the sales it got came at the expense of our original store. So - but I really wanted to grow the business. I mean, I am not saying I - all the challenges were like, oh, boy, another great challenge, it 's hitting us really hard. What I 've always thought is OK, this is a great lesson for me. I can learn something here. I am learning something here. And I learned a lot from those early failures or those - not really failures but sort of the early trials. @!GUY-RAZ# So if you were looking to expand the business, presumably you would have to raise some pretty serious money, right? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. In 1988, we decided we could n't grow as fast as we wanted to grow from just our retained profits. Tapped out all of our friends and family, and there was no angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And this was a time when venture capital was not really very cranked up like it is today. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# We hired a banker. And we began to try to raise venture capital money. And we got rejected again and again and again. And we - trying to talk to the venture capitalists, they just could n't get what we were doing. I mean, one guy who turned me down, he said to me, he said, you know, John, I see you got a pretty good business here, but it looks to me like - I looked at all the stores - and you 're just a bunch of hippies. And you 're just selling food to other hippies. I do n't think that 's a very big market. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And if it 's going to spread further than - then the big companies are going to take a lot of interest in it. And I do n't think you can compete with Safeway. I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They 're going to run you out of business. I mean, people are still telling me that today. I 've been hearing it for 40 years now. @!GUY-RAZ# But, I mean, he had a point back then, right? I mean, you 're talking about the mid-to-late ' 80s. And, of course, I 'm sure that guy is kicking himself today, right? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. He apologized to me about 10 years later, said it was the worst decision he ever made( laughter). @!GUY-RAZ# Were these venture capital companies based in Texas, or did you go to like Silicon Valley? Like, where were you looking for money? @!JOHN-MACKEY# We did go to Silicon Valley. And we got two based out of Houston, but we were beginning to slowly cross over because we were not only selling natural and organic foods, but our quality of food was better. And so we were beginning to get a more mainstream shopper coming in. And that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got two investors from Houston, and we got another one out of Silicon Valley. @!GUY-RAZ# And then what did that enable you to do, to just expand and expand more? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. We sold 34 percent of the business for an $8.5 million valuation. @!GUY-RAZ# Wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# So about eight times our earnings or about, I do n't know, 20 percent - 15 percent of our sales. It was - it 's ridiculous the kind of valuations people get today compared to what we could get back in the late 1980s. @!GUY-RAZ# And is this also when you started to think about going public? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. But venture capitalists, they did n't want us to go public. They wanted us to do another round of venture financing. But I was determined not to do another round of venture financing because that would have given them control of the company. And I just did n't trust the venture guys. Venture capitalists are like hitchhikers, hitchhikers with credit cards. And as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will help you pay for the gas. But if you do n't take them where they want to go, they will try to hijack the car, and they will hire a new driver and throw you out on the side of the road. So I did not trust the VCs. I liked them. I did n't trust them. I did not want them to take control of the company. So I thought we 're going to go public, and then we 're going to get the hitchhikers out of the car. So it was a little early for Whole Foods to go public, or so I was told later on, but we did go public back in 1992. And we raised about $28 million. @!GUY-RAZ# And so overnight your company was worth what? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Overnight we were with about a hundred million when we went public. @!GUY-RAZ# And so what did that mean? I mean, did that mean that instantly you had all of this cash and you could actually grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes. The greatest thing about it was we had a currency, the currency being our own stock. We can now go to other companies that were like Whole Foods Market. We were the biggest, but there were other - we had other peers. @!GUY-RAZ# So you were looking to buy them? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. First one was Bread &amp; Circus... @!GUY-RAZ# In Boston. @!JOHN-MACKEY#... In Boston. @!GUY-RAZ# I remember that place. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Great company. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And next, we acquired Mrs. Gooch 's from... @!GUY-RAZ# I remember Mrs. Gooch 's, yup. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And we did that in ' 93. We did a big one with Fresh Fields. And they had 22 stores. We acquired them in 1996. Once we had those, we were able to grow much faster. @!GUY-RAZ# So as your, like, expansion just moved at a clip - right? - through the ' 90s and into the 2000s... @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. @!GUY-RAZ#... I mean, I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how people produced food and created new markets for organic food. @!JOHN-MACKEY# That 's certainly true, we did. I mean, we did n't do it by ourselves obviously, but - because you have farmers. But we created much of the demand for natural and organic in the United States, our success did. And that created more farmers and more entrepreneurs wanting to farm organically or more manufacturers wanting to produce organic manufactured goods. So we helped. We had a huge impact, we still do. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. What percentage of the grocery market does Whole Foods control today in the U.S.? @!JOHN-MACKEY# it 's about 1.5 to 2 percent. I do n't know if we - we do n't control that, by the way( laughter). @!GUY-RAZ# Right. Yeah. But about 1 to 2 percent of all grocery shops. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah. @!GUY-RAZ# Which is a lot smaller than a lot of people would assume because Whole Foods ' influence is probably much greater than that then @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our weight class. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. I mean, it 's surprising. How many stores are - do you have today across the country? @!JOHN-MACKEY# We have about 465. @!GUY-RAZ# So I want to ask you a question about the stores because you, of course, have heard the joke that whole foods is more like Whole Paycheck - right? - that the prices are so expensive for most people. So, I mean, do you think that 's a fair criticism? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, of course we do n't like that. And it 's not a - when that nickname was given to us, it was first given to us affectionately by people who loved us. And then it became a club that people would beat on Whole Foods who did n't like us. And there is a kind of a tendency, for people to think you can get the same quality stuff at lower prices. I do n't think people have the same quality Whole Foods has. we have the best quality. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and price. @!GUY-RAZ# And, I mean, you 've had people who 've attacked you as well because you, I mean, you 've been kind of a lightning rod with some of the things that you 've said and written about like climate change and unions that do n't - in the views of, people - do n't necessarily seem to jive with Whole Foods. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Well, my take is, of course, that people that know me like me. People that do n't know me and they just read things or hear things, they project. But, you know, I 've learned a lot. I 've learned that there are like four topics I just do n't talk about in public anymore. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. What are they? @!JOHN-MACKEY# I do n't talk about politics, religion, sex or GMOs. @!GUY-RAZ#( Laughter) That 's - what is there left to talk about? @!JOHN-MACKEY# I mean, I would n't even care if people hated me. It 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my baby. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Stop picking on my kid. Do whatever you want with me, but leave the kid out of it. @!GUY-RAZ# You know, John, when somebody, like, anyone listening to this who 's been to Whole Foods - right? - like when I walk into a Whole Foods, there 's a feeling that you get the company has certain values that a lot of the shoppers identify with, right? There 's, you know, there 's sort of an attempt to help make the world a better place and to work with community organizations. And it 's - it feels very, I mean, lack of a better word, it feels sort of liberal to a lot of people. And so you can understand why people are interested in the people behind Whole Foods, people like you. They 're interested in how you see the world, right? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yes. And I do n't know - I do n't equate liberal with caring, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political argument with you. But there 's a meta narrative about business in our world, Guy. And that narrative is that business sucks and business is greedy and selfish and exploitative. It only cares about money. But people do n't want to believe Whole Foods Market 's a different kind of company - we are. We 're purpose-driven. We 're stakeholder-focused. If I 'm proud of anything, it 's that Whole Foods Market has made a difference. And we do care. @!GUY-RAZ# You know, I 'm wondering whether some of the criticism that you 've had over the years, you know, even the way Whole Foods does business, has that improved Whole Foods? Have there been times where people have said hey, you know, what Whole Foods is doing with this is wrong and - or protesting. Has it changed the way you guys have actually operated? @!JOHN-MACKEY# Yeah, it has. I mean, the most famous example is back in 2003. We were being picketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular duck we were selling which they considered to be a factory farm duck. But I got into a dialogue with one of the activists, a very passionate young woman named Lauren Ornelas. And I - you know, after about a month or so, she sends me an email. And she says, you know, Mr. Mackey, I see after our dialogue that you 're a very idealistic person. However, when it comes to livestock animals, honestly, you do n't know what you 're talking about. You are not well-informed on this subject. And, you know, I thought about it. And I thought, you know, she 's really right. I do n't know that much about this personally. I 'm just - I decided to become an expert myself. And that summer, summer 2003, I read about a dozen books on how we raise animals in America. And I was utterly horrified. I 'd just been living in denial. It was a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer, I had made two resolutions. One, I was going to go - to be - I was becoming a vegan. And number two, I knew Whole Foods needed to do a much better job, that the accusations that the animal rights people had made about what we were doing were fundamentally correct. We then began a process of bringing in animal activists and Whole Foods people in dialogue. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# And that that led to the Global Animal Partnership which Whole Foods Market sponsored and tried to follow the GAP standards for the last several years. @!GUY-RAZ# Whole Foods obviously had this explosive growth and really became the biggest natural foods market in the country, but as was predicted, the big guys got into this game. I mean, Wal-Mart is a bigger organic grocer now. And there 's Trader Joe 's. And there 's competitors. And does that keep you up at night? @!JOHN-MACKEY# No. I mean, it 's just new challenges. This is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't emphasize creating a business, it 's - there is no point in business where you can say at last I have arrived. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# What makes business so amazing and makes capitalism so dynamic is that, in fact, people - if you 're successful, people copy you. And that 's what 's happened with Whole Foods. A lot of people have copied us. That helps keep your edge and helps keep you on your toes. Complacency is a very, very bad thing to have in business. The two things that hold - bring a lot of businesses down, one 's complacency. And you get successful. And you start to sit on your laurels. And the other one 's hubris or arrogance. You think that you 're just better than everybody else. That 's a huge mistake. Those are both big mistakes. @!GUY-RAZ# John, you still, of course, live in Austin, so I 'm assuming that now and again you must pass by the location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go out of my way to pass by it. @!GUY-RAZ# And do you - what is it today? @!JOHN-MACKEY# It 's a school. @!GUY-RAZ# Oh, wow. @!JOHN-MACKEY# It 's a school. And fun - one of my friends started that school, like a belly school. And I got a tour of it a few years ago. And the thing that was so odd - of course, they changed some of it - but I remembered it just like it was yesterday. And I could see where the - where we had our bulk bins. And I could see - because they left the basic structure of it intact, so it was a trip down memory row for sure. @!GUY-RAZ# John, a certain point, I mean, you will not run Whole Foods, right? I mean, you 'll move on or retire or whatever. I mean, can the company - can Whole Foods continue without, you know, without the charisma - without your charisma, without your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean, you are running it. @!JOHN-MACKEY# Of course it can. And - but, I mean, when the founder - I 'm the last founder left. I mean, Craig was the second to last, and he left almost 20 years ago. And a lot of the people that I built the business with besides the founders, they 're retiring now because they 're in their ' 60s. And they 've made a lot of money too over the years through Whole Foods. So there 'll be no one that ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as I love it. @!GUY-RAZ# Yeah. @!JOHN-MACKEY# But building a business is a little bit like having children and watching the children grow up is that you hope your child is healthy. And you hope your child is happy. And you hope your child has integrity and does the right thing. And it 's important to have a good founder and entrepreneur, but the great businesses continue to live on after the founder moves. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods. From that one tiny store to today, the company 's market cap is now about $11 billion. And despite selling lots of meat and dairy products, John is a committed vegan and a pretty good home cook. He 's been known to serve his dinner guests tofu with mushrooms, tahini and broccoli. And for dessert? Avocado chocolate pudding. @!GUY-RAZ# And please do stick around because in just a moment we 're going to hear from you about the things you 're building. @!GUY-RAZ# Hey, thanks for sticking around because it 's time now for How You Built That. And this story is from Kyle Ewing in Denver, Colo., who got his idea for a business in a kind of a roundabout way. @!KYLE-EWING# I got the idea when I was trying to create a product for students traveling abroad. This product was a backup copy of their passport. @!GUY-RAZ# Kyle was trying to sell backup passports online that would be as durable as the real thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market for this type of product does n't yet exist, so I was trying to create the market, which proved to be very difficult. And I was trying to figure out what to do when the phone rang. @!GUY-RAZ# And the guy on the phone, it was actually somebody who said, hey, Kyle, I love your passports. I even bought four of them for my kids. @!KYLE-EWING# And he said, all four of my daughters use the SOS world pass. I love it, but I have a question for you. Can I buy a case of your paper? @!GUY-RAZ# And at that moment, Kyle realized that the waterproof paper he was using for the passports was actually a better business idea than just the passports. @!KYLE-EWING# That moment was me standing up out of my chair and spiking the pencil and doing a touchdown dance because it was an immediate lightbulb moment where I realized this failing business just grew legs. And all of a sudden, I had a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for. @!GUY-RAZ# And that is a pretty long list. @!KYLE-EWING# Waterproof restaurant menus, waterproof children 's books, waterproof maps, field manuals for the U.S. Navy, nautical charts for the U.S. Coast Guard. @!GUY-RAZ# Now, to back up just a little, Kyle is not an engineer. But when he was working on the passport idea, he made a bunch of calls to chemical experts. And he told them he was looking to make paper that was totally waterproof, much more waterproof than say, you know, just laminating something. @!KYLE-EWING# So iteration after iteration, we finally got to paper that 's both waterproof and rip-proof and something that can also receive and hold ink when it 's been printed on. @!GUY-RAZ# He eventually found a manufacturer in the U.S. to make a polyester pulp that could be pressed and rolled into waterproof paper. But he wanted to tinker with the product himself, so he moved a laser printer into his living room. @!KYLE-EWING# But when I put it through my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer, and it smelled like burning plastic. And the entire printer was trash after that. @!GUY-RAZ# Kyle 's very supportive wife actually came home that night. She smelled the burning smell. And she said... @!KYLE-EWING# Kyle, I love this arts and crafts project you 've taken on, but it 's time to get to a more realistic product or business idea. @!GUY-RAZ# But one printer and seven iterations later and Kyle says he came up with the most waterproof paper on the market. And he has the clients to prove it, including, yes, the U.S. Navy and Air Force, several restaurant and hotel chains, university labs, even Google. @!KYLE-EWING# And a good entrepreneurial day is when you sit back, you look at your sales or you look at the new client you just got, and you think, oh, my gosh, this is a real business. I 'm building something that matters, and it actually is a success. @!GUY-RAZ# Kyle Ewing of Denver. He launched TerraSlate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects revenue to reach into the low millions.
