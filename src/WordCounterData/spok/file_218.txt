Colchicine comes from a plant called autumn crocus. And Mary was an avid gardener. ROBERT NELSON( 09:24:12) : Autumn crocus can be mistaken for wild garlic. So if she had taken the -- the leaves off or boiled the bulbs in water, and somehow ingested it that way, that would cause the -- the colchicine toxicity. ANDREA CANNING( 09:24:24) : This is a deadly plant? ROBERT NELSON( 09:24:25) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Did she have autumn crocus in her garden? ROBERT NELSON( 09:24:28) : No. They looked at that. And there was none of those plants in the garden. ANDREA CANNING( 09:24:31) : How much colchicine do you have to ingest for it to be deadly? ROBERT NELSON( 09:24:35) : If you 're talking gout medicine, it 's like you would have to take anywhere from forty to sixty pills, depending on your size. And it -- it -- you 'd have to take it all at once to be -- to be a lethal dose.( Photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:24:46) : If Mary did take that many pills, maybe she did it on purpose. ROBERT NELSON( 09:24:51) : We talked to family. We started talking to people. We do n't believe it 's suicide.( Photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:24:55) : That left one other scenario, a disturbing one. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poisoned, given just -- TAMARYN YODER( 09:25:01) : Never. No. ANDREA CANNING( 09:25:03) : The violent nature of it? TAMARYN YODER( 09:25:06) : No, because the thought of anybody doing that to her, just -- LESTER HOLT( 09:25:10) : To her.( Robert Nelson) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:25:11) : But that 's exactly what the detective was considering. ROBERT NELSON( 09:25:15) : Did somebody poison Mary? Did somebody deliberately give this to Mary? We sat down with the ME 's office and went through everything, all their -- the autopsy. At that point, we were looking at it as a homicide.( Photo of Mary Yoder ; exterior of residence) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:25:24) : Now the hunt for a killer was on. And some of Mary 's sisters thought they knew where investigators should start. LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:25:34) : Coming up -- JANINE KING( 09:25:35) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Photo of Mary and Bill Yoder ; car on road at night) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:25:37) : Mary 's husband Bill, and a mysterious other woman. ROBERT NELSON( 09:25:41) : We began to wonder was there a relationship beforehand? That would have been a motive. Then we would 've had to say, well, Bill now has a motive for this.( ANNOUNCEMENTS)( Town ; photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:29:30) : It was four months after Mary Yoder 's death, and investigators told the family they were convinced Mary had been murdered.( 09:29:38) : What is that moment like when your mom is now -- LIANA HEDGE( 09:29:42) : Why? ANDREA CANNING( 09:29:42) : -- a murder victim. TAMARYN YODER( 09:29:43) : There -- there is n't even words for it. LIANA HEDGE( 09:29:45) : That was just -- TAMARYN YODER( 09:29:46) : Your world flips upside down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down is n't up anymore. So that was terrifying.( Liana Hedge and Tamaryn Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:29:54) : And Mary 's daughters believed their mother had n't just been killed. She 'd practically been tortured. LIANA HEDGE( 09:30:00) : Colchicine. One of the hallmarks of it, it stops your heart. It breaks it. And it breaks it over and over and over again.( Robert Nelson ; Colchicine bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:30:10) : Detective Robert Nelson was trying to figure out who might have used the drug to poison Mary.( 09:30:16) : There were actually a couple of TV shows that kind of echoed this case. ROBERT NELSON( 09:30:20) : Yes. There was the TV show House, which had colchicine.( Excerpt from House) ANDREA CANNING( 09:30:28) : But this is real-life now?( Chiropractor 's office ; photo of Mary Yoder) ROBERT NELSON( 09:30:29) : Yes. Did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about? Did they give Mary, you know, something to eat? ANDREA CANNING( 09:30:35) : Any obvious suspects, potential suspects? ROBERT NELSON( 09:30:38) : No, not at first.( Robert Nelson ; photo of Mary and Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:30:39) : But Detective Nelson had to start somewhere. What about the person closest to Mary, her husband?( 09:30:46) : What was it that was leading you in Bill 's direction? ROBERT NELSON( 09:30:49) : At this point, basically, just because he was the husband. In these types of cases, it always seems to be the spouse is the one responsible if it 's a poisoning case.( Sallie Bakert, Janine King and Sharon Mills) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:30:56) : Mary 's sisters had known Bill for decades.( 09:30:58) : If there were problems in the marriage, was Mary the type to share with her sisters? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration in certain situations. But she tried very hard never to say anything negative about Bill. JANINE KING( 09:31:11) : Yeah. SALLIE BAKERT( 09:31:11) : Yeah, she always put a positive spin on anything if she could.( Photo of Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:31:15) : Still, her sisters never forgot a story Mary told them. It happened before the time of her wedding thirty eight years earlier. SALLIE BAKERT( 09:31:22) : They 're out in my parents ' yard and Bill says to her, you know this is to be an open marriage, right? And she was taken aback. She said to me, I had the strength to tell him, no, Bill, we 're going to have to not get married, you know, if you ca n't commit to monogamy. ANDREA CANNING( 09:31:40) : He backed down? SALLIE BAKERT( 09:31:41) : Yeah, he came back and said, okay, I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Yoder ; car on highway at night) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:31:46) : But did he? It was no secret that in the years that followed Bill would often disappear on weekends. SHARON MILLS( 09:31:52) : He 'd take night trips to Albany, weekends, to be by himself, he said, to write.( Janine King ; photo of Janine King and Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:31:57) : Janine kept wondering about that day Mary dropped by her house out of the blue. Did she want to tell her something about her marriage? JANINE KING( 09:32:04) : she wanted to talk or she wanted to open up the door, you know, for us to start -- start talking about something.( Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:32:10) : The sisters also thought back to Bill 's behavior. How he seemed so unemotional to them after Mary 's death. JANINE KING( 09:32:17) : Well, some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they did n't know what she died of exactly. But he had her cremated very quickly. He had her phone turned off very quickly. ANDREA CANNING( 09:32:27) : Too quickly? JANINE KING( 09:32:27) : Yeah, too quickly.( Photo of Bill and Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:32:28) : Still, the sisters say the marriage looked pretty solid in recent years. JANINE KING( 09:32:33) : Our brother-in-law seemingly became a really good husband. You know, he was helpful in ways and letting her do things she wanted to do. I was just thinking, well, gee, Bill has really come a long way.( Photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:32:46) : And certainly no one wanted to believe that Mary 's own husband would harm her. JANINE KING( 09:32:51) : When I was interviewed, I was not ready to say that I suspect my brother-in-law. Because I really had no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being, I 'm not going to accuse him of something without evidence.( Robert Nelson) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:33:01) : Any fair-minded detective would need that evidence, too -- along with a clear idea of a motive.( 09:33:08) : Did Bill stand to inherit everything that was Mary 's, everything in the marriage? ROBERT NELSON( 09:33:12) : They had the business together, but there was no- - no large sums of money that Bill would have gotten if -- of Mary 's death.( Photo of Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:33:19) : Still authorities kept tabs on Bill, monitoring his behavior.( 09:33:24) : How did you take that, knowing that the police were looking at your dad? LIANA HEDGE( 09:33:28) : It 's terrifying. TAMARYN YODER( 09:33:30) : Yup. LIANA HEDGE( 09:33:31) : But we did n't understand, because there was nothing in their relationship that indicated that there was any trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible just -- TAMARYN YODER( 09:33:41) : We did n't know if our father was involved. We did n't know if it was a complete stranger. We had -- LIANA HEDGE( 09:33:49) : No idea. TAMARYN YODER( 09:33:49) : -- absolutely no idea.( Liana Hedge and Tamaryn Yoder ; exterior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:33:52) : Detectives told the siblings not to talk about the investigation, especially not to their father. LIANA HEDGE( 09:33:58) : Well, we were n't letting him in on the fact that -- TAMARYN YODER( 09:33:59) : Right. LIANA HEDGE( 09:34:00) : -- we had been talking with the investigators.( Exterior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:34:02) : They eventually called Bill in for an interview. ROBERT NELSON( 09:34:05) : Bill 's not an emotional person. So he did n't seem very upset. You know, he did -- he was n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He 's not shedding any tears or -- ROBERT NELSON( 09:34:14) : Well, we 're not speaking to Bill until five months later, after Mary 's death.( Photo of Bill and Mary Yoder ; interior of chiropractic office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:34:18) : Bill spoke to them for five hours. And he gave investigators permission to search the couple 's chiropractic business, where deputies collected computers, a typewriter and a fax machine. ROBERT NELSON( 09:34:30) : He signed a consent. We went to the office. And he was very helpful. I mean he -- he was very forthcoming, he gave us everything we asked for.( Exterior of police station ; photo of Mary and Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:34:36) : And they had a lot of questions for Bill. At the top of the list? Something they 'd learned while they were tracking him. It turns out Bill was already dating again. In fact, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING( 09:34:48) : Shortly after Mary died, my mother said, why is he always going out of town? And I said, I do n't -- I do n't know, mom, maybe he needs some time or whatever. And she says, he 's got a girlfriend. You know -- SHARON MILLS( 09:35:01) : This is coming from a ninety-two-year-old woman -- JANINE KING( 09:35:02) : Yeah. SHARON MILLS( 09:35:02) : -- ninety-one-year-old woman. JANINE KING( 09:35:04) : And she goes, I 'm not feeling right about this.( Robert Nelson) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:35:06) : Detective Nelson was the one to tell Sharon their mom was right. SHARON MILLS( 09:35:10) : He told me that they had in fact found Bill to be with another woman. ANDREA CANNING( 09:35:16) : Did he tell you who the woman was? SHARON MILLS( 09:35:17) : No. He did not. ROBERT NELSON( 09:35:19) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? ANDREA CANNING( 09:35:21) : Why is it important to determine now if this relationship started before Mary 's death? ROBERT NELSON( 09:35:27) : If it was before Mary 's death, obviously, that would have been a motive. Then we would have had to say, well, Bill now has a motive for this. ANDREA CANNING( 09:35:33) : That 's kind of a big deal. ROBERT NELSON( 09:35:35) : Yes. And that came up, that was an obvious red flag and we were very concerned about it.( Police interview room ; photo of Bill and Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:35:39) : In his interview with detectives, Bill said he had not cheated on his wife. The relationship began after Mary died. And phone records seemed to confirm it. ROBERT NELSON( 09:35:49) : We were able to verify all this information that he was n't having phone conversation, text messages with her, prior to Mary 's death. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @)( 09:35:56) : So the obvious suspect, the husband with a new romance, did n't seem so obvious after all. But the detective had a new lead. A big one. And it would change everything. LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:36:10) : Coming up -- ANDREA CANNING( 09:36:11) : You might have a smoking gun here. ROBERT NELSON( 09:36:13) : Yes.( Letter ; photo of Jeep) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:36:13) : -- like a bolt from the blue, an anonymous letter lands in their laps. And it would lead to a poison piece of evidence. ANDREA CANNING( 09:36:21) : That 's your big moment in this case? ROBERT NELSON( 09:36:24) : The big moment. LESTER HOLT( 09:36:25) : When DATELINE continues.( ANNOUNCEMENTS)( Robert Nelson ; letter) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:40:08) : Detective Robert Nelson was making little headway in solving Mary Yoder 's homicide when a bombshell clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NELSON( 09:40:19) : I received the letter stating that Adam did this, he was responsible. He told this person that he did it.( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley ; letter ; photo of Bill and Adam Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:40:25) : Adam was Adam Yoder, Mary and Bill 's twenty-five-year-old son. The letter said he was the killer. The person who penned the letter claimed to be close to Adam, writing : " He got a bottle of colchicine off online and put the toxin in one of her vitamins when he was over at his parents sic house. " With a jolt, the letter dramatically shifted the focus of the investigation from father to son.( 09:40:51) : You might have a smoking gun here? ROBERT NELSON( 09:40:52) : Yes. There 's a lot of detail in that letter. ANDREA CANNING( 09:40:55) : Did Adam have any criminal history? ROBERT NELSON( 09:40:56) : No, we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoder and Katie Conley ; Vin and Kathy Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:40:59) : Remember, Adam dated Katie ; and her parents, Vin( ph) and Kathy, knew him well. KATHY CONLEY( 09:41:04) : When he was dating our daughter, he would come to the house every day. ANDREA CANNING( 09:41:09) : And how did you feel about the relationship? KATHY CONLEY( 09:41:11) : There was always something off, something we -- we did n't care for with Adam. He was kind of off, detached. VIN CONLEY( 09:41:21) : We 'd eat dinner as a family and Adam would sit across from me. And -- KATHY CONLEY( 09:41:27) : He would n't make eye contact with you. VIN CONLEY( 09:41:28) : -- talked -- KATHY CONLEY( 09:41:28) : And he would n't really talk to anyone in the family. VIN CONLEY( 09:41:31) : The communication stopped a little bit between myself and him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point feel like maybe I should say something? Or did you totally stay out of it? KATHY CONLEY( 09:41:40) : No, we did mention to Katie that we did n't think there was something different with Adam, and we really did n't feel comfortable about it. Her sisters also recognized that fact, too.( Shannon, Sara and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:41:53) : Shannon and Sara Conley are Katie 's twin sisters. They were n't sad when Katie and Adam split up.( 09:41:59) : Why did they finally break up? SARAH CONLEY( 09:42:00) : Katie just had enough of him being up, being down, being up, being down, and just some of the things he would say just were n't right. ANDREA CANNING( 09:42:10) : Did Adam have any issues with his mom that you know of? SHANNON CONLEY( 09:42:14) : I know they definitely were not as close as our family was. He would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like, I -- I do n't get it. Like, I 've met your mother. She 's great.( Letter) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:42:24) : So why? If there was any truth to the letter, what motive would Adam have? The letter seemed to have an answer.( 09:42:32) : Why did it say he did it? ROBERT NELSON( 09:42:33) : He thought he 'd gain financially if his mother passed away. He thought he 'd have a financial gain. Also, that there was arguments between him and his parents that he was upset with the -- with his mother. So it listed that as two of the reasonings.( Letter) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:42:45) : And the letter told authorities something else. The colchicine container is under the front seat passenger side of his jeep until he figures out where to dispose of it next.( 09:42:56) : What 's your strategy going in with Adam? ROBERT NELSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how we want to go about with Adam? We said, let 's -- let 's bring him up here. Let 's -- if he comes up in his vehicle, the letter says the colchicine is in the vehicle. We 'll talk to Adam. See if he comes up here with the colchicine. ANDREA CANNING( 09:43:10) : Was this a bit of a test to see if Adam would show up in the Jeep? ROBERT NELSON( 09:43:13) : Yes.( Photo of Jeep) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:43:14) : And when Adam arrived to talk to the detectives, he was driving the jeep in question. ROBERT NELSON( 09:43:20) : We were trying to get a feel for Adam at that point to see, you know, is he responsible for his mother 's death? So we spoke to him. We then showed him parts of the letter that said where this colchicine would be, and which he was taken aback. ANDREA CANNING( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? ROBERT NELSON( 09:43:38) : Shocked. ANDREA CANNING( 09:43:38) : Did you feel his reaction was genuine? ROBERT NELSON( 09:43:41) : Yes. But we still had some concerns also about his reactions. ANDREA CANNING( 09:43:44) : In what way? ROBERT NELSON( 09:43:45) : He was just hesitant to let us go look in his vehicle.( Interior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:43:49) : While one detective talked to Adam, another called his sister Liana. LIANA HEDGE( 09:43:54) : They 're, like, we actually have a letter. What do you mean you have a letter? Well, the letter 's actually pointing the finger at your brother and it says that he 's got this in his car. And -- ANDREA CANNING( 09:44:05) : The poison in his car. LIANA HEDGE( 09:44:05) : The poison in his car. And I said what do you mean you have a letter that says my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important. We got to look in your brother 's car. You got to convince him to let us -- you know, if you can talk to him, let him know because if he leaves the station, this is n't going to be good.( Police station parking lot ; photo of Jeep) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:44:23) : Adam eventually gave investigators permission and they went outside to the parking lot.( 09:44:28) : Moment of truth. You open the vehicle door. And what do you find inside? ROBERT NELSON( 09:44:32) : They go out there and -- and they search the vehicle right where it says it 's going to be in the letter. And we pull out a cardboard sleeve with the colchicine inside the sleeve.( Photos of interior of Jeep and bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:44:43) : And just like that the investigator seemed to have the weapon right in his hand.( 09:44:48) : That 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : The big moment.( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:44:52) : Coming up, Adam Yoder, secret killer? ROBERT NELSON( 09:44:56) : It was frustrating. It just was n't fitting.( Photo of Jeep) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 09:44:58) : This deadly puzzle was n't solved yet. LIANA HEDGE( 09:45:02) : You feel like, all of a sudden, somebody dropped you in the middle of hell and every time you get an answer, it 's worse.( ANNOUNCEMENTS)( Letter ; photos of medicine bottle in Jeep) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:48:37) : The anonymous letter writer had been right. The colchicine used to kill Mary Yoder was under the front passenger seat of her son Adam 's jeep. It was a pure form of the drug, far more potent than what doctors prescribe. And Adam?( 09:48:52) : What 's his reaction? ROBERT NELSON( 09:48:53) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pull that out. ANDREA CANNING( 09:48:56) : The poison is in his Jeep. ROBERT NELSON( 09:48:58) : Yes.( Photo of Jeep ; photo of receipt) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:48:59) : What 's more, in the Jeep, along with the colchicine, there was a receipt for the drug. And on the receipt -- ROBERT NELSON( 09:49:06) : It had an e-mail address. It also had Adam 's name on there. And from there, the mradamyoder1990 Gmail account, which was very important to us, was listed on there.( Photo of Colchicine bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:49:16) : Adam said he 'd never seen the colchicine before in his life. Someone must have planted it.( 09:49:22) : In that moment, what are you thinking? ROBERT NELSON( 09:49:24) : At that moment, we 're thinking would he bring the poison up here with him? I mean it does n't make sense. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you got the colchicine, you would n't drive up to the sheriff 's office with the colchicine in -- knowingly in your car. You would get rid of it. But again, you have anonymous letter saying he admitted to doing it, and that the colchicine would be in his car. So you kind of have a split reaction as to which way we are looking at it.( Photo of Mary Yoder ; exterior of hospital ; photo of Adam Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:49:46) : Could Adam really have poisoned his mother? When they looked into his whereabouts on the day Mary got sick, they discovered Adam was more than three hundred miles away visiting his sister. LIANA HEDGE( 09:49:57) : I knew at the time my mom got sick, he was with me and I could n't understand wait how would he have been involved. TAMARYN YODER( 09:50:06) : My mother was my brother 's biggest supporter. He turned to her first for everything. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did this did n't make sense.( Photo of Jeep) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:50:17) : It did n't entirely make sense to detectives either.( 09:50:20) : You let Adam go. ROBERT NELSON( 09:50:22) : Yes. ANDREA CANNING( 09:50:22) : But I would imagine you 're not crossing Adam off your list yet. ROBERT NELSON( 09:50:28) : No. We are comfortable enough to let him go, but we did n't say he absolutely had nothing to do with it.( Detectives ; David King ; photo of Adam Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:50:33) : The investigation led them to talk to Adam 's cousin and roommate David King. He 's the son of Mary 's sister, Janine. David told them that after Mary died, Adam was enrolled in college, but his life seemed to be falling apart. DAVID KING( 09:50:48) : He slowly started dropping all of his classes. And he was pretty much staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANNING( 09:50:56) : Were you really concerned about him? DAVID KING( 09:50:58) : I was. He had expressed to me that he was suicidal a couple of times, which was very concerning.( Exterior of residence ; photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:51:06) : It was only when detectives were interviewing David that he realized Adam was a person of interest in Mary 's death.( 09:51:13) : Did that just floor you? DAVID KING( 09:51:14) : I was absolutely floored. And at that time they had asked me flat-out, do you think Adam could 've killed his mother? ANDREA CANNING( 09:51:19) : What did you tell them? DAVID KING( 09:51:20) : At the time I said, no, I do n't think he would. ANDREA CANNING( 09:51:22) : At the time. DAVID KING( 09:51:23) : At the time.( David King ; Liana Hedge and Tamaryn Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin 's behavior was the result of grief -- or guilt. Adam 's sisters on the other hand had no doubt Adam was innocent. They were convinced he was being framed.( 09:51:37) : Who did you think could have framed him? LIANA HEDGE( 09:51:39) : At that point, a possibility was my father. ANDREA CANNING( 09:51:44) : So you actually believed your father might 've framed your brother. LIANA HEDGE( 09:51:46) : We believed it could 've been possible. The investigators were leaning very heavy onto it. And pretty much telling us without coming out -- right out and saying it, that they were sure my father had done this.( Photo of Mary and Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:52:01) : It was impossible to wrap their heads around. TAMARYN YODER( 09:52:04) : This ca n't be real, this ca n't really be happening. LIANA HEDGE( 09:52:06) : We had to reality check with each other -- TAMARYN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 09:52:08) : -- because you 're, like, did it happen or did it not? TAMARYN YODER( 09:52:10) : Yeah, is this a dream? What 's going on? LIANA HEDGE( 09:52:14) : You feel like, all of a sudden, somebody dropped you in the middle of hell and you ca n't find your way out. And every time you get an answer, it 's worse.( Detectives) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:52:24) : But detectives did n't have enough evidence to prove any of their theories. ROBERT NELSON( 09:52:28) : It was frustrating. I mean there was a lot of nights we were frustrated by this case. We looked at Adam, but yet, nothing else was pointing the finger at Adam. It just was n't fitting. And the same with Bill, we 'd want to say, okay, we -- Bill did this. But why did Bill do it? And so there was times we were kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:52:45) : Looking for new insight, detectives turned to someone outside the Yoder clan -- Katie, who dated Adam and worked for Bill and Mary.

ROBERT NELSON( 09:54:10) : She makes some comments about, Adam 's acting strangely, and is n't acting right. ANDREA CANNING( 09:54:15) : Is she worried about Adam? That maybe Adam had something to do with this? ROBERT NELSON( 09:54:18) : Yes. She 's kind of hinting that, you know, the way Adam is acting, that he may be responsible for his mother 's death.( Police interview room) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:54:24) : As detectives listened to Katie talk about Adam, her ex, they wondered where this was going. A light bulb went off for the investigator. ROBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, did you write the letter? ANDREA CANNING( 09:54:34) : And what does she say? ROBERT NELSON( 09:54:36) : She said, yes.( Katie Conley ; town) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 09:54:37) : Detectives had found the person who wrote that letter pointing the finger at Adam.

ROBERT NELSON( 10:01:48) : Yes.( Photo of Katie Conley ; police interview room) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:01:49) : Key witness or prime suspect? Which was she?

ANDREA CANNING( 10:02:11) : Is Katie starting to panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : Yes. at this point, she 's becoming worried about where things are -- were turning and then what it 's -- how it 's looking for her. Because if we did n't arrest Adam when we found the colchicine, now she knows we do n't necessarily believe what 's in that letter.( Police interview room) KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:02:26) : I 'm just afraid, because Adam 's really smart.( Police interview room) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:02:33) : At one point, Katie told the detectives Adam had threatened to frame her. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:02:38) : At the office, he said that if anyone was going to get in trouble, it 's going to be me. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:02:43) : Okay. For what? For being at the office? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video) Yeah. Like, I 'm connected to everything, he said.

She always tried to point the finger back at Adam.( Photo of bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:02:58) : She also said something they thought was just plain weird. She made an observation about who uses poison. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:03:06) : Guys also do n't use poison. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:03:10) : A lot of people do. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:03:13) : They say it 's a lady 's weapon. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:03:16) : They say it 's a lady 's weapon? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:03:18) : Yeah.( Police interview room ; exterior of police station ; Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:03:19) : Of course, that did n't prove Katie was Mary 's killer. She was free to go. But she had not done much during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it. ROBERT NELSON( 10:03:30) : We wanted to speak to her again. But at this point now, we also had a lot more police work to do.( Exterior of chiropractic office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:03:35) : They started to dig, and quickly thought they were on the right track. For one thing, Katie had opportunity- -she was with Mary at the office that day. Poison experts thought Mary had ingested the colchicine around lunchtime. ROBERT NELSON( 10:03:49) : There was a kitchen area in the back where they would sit and have lunch and make their drinks. If Mary was out in this other room a couple offices away working on patients, Katie would have the time to go back there and do something.( Receipt ; email log-in screen) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:03:58) : And that Gmail account that had been used to buy the poison, digital records showed Adam 's computer had never been used to log into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 10:04:10) : Katie had accessed the mradamyoder account from not only home, but from the office.( Robert Nelson ; search results from phone) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:04:16) : In fact, the entire digital trail seemed to lead detectives right to Katie 's doorstep. On her phone they found several searches for the word colchicine. ROBERT NELSON( 10:04:25) : All this evidence comes in against her. No -- nothing 's coming back on Bill and nothing came back on Adam.( Photo of Katie Conley ; exterior of chiropractic office ; photo of Mary Yoder ; Mary Yoder ; exterior of police station ; police interview video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:04:32) : But there was a gaping hole in their theory. If Katie really was Mary 's killer, why had she done it? The only person who could answer that was Katie herself. It was time for another conversation. And this one was going to get intense. ROBERT NELSON( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it, Katie? Help me understand. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:04:53) : Oh, my God.

ANDREA CANNING( 10:07:11) : A mentor relationship? ROBERT NELSON( 10:07:12) : Yes. ANDREA CANNING( 10:07:13) : So, was this very surprising to you then? ROBERT NELSON( 10:07:15) : Absolutely. Once she admitted to writing that letter, it was a -- definitely a turn of events for us.( Robert Nelson ; photo of Katie Conley and photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:07:22) : For two months, detectives followed the digital trail, and it led them to only one conclusion. Surprising as it may have been, it was looking like Katie was Mary 's killer. The only thing detectives say they did n't have was her motive.( 10:07:37) : You bring Katie in. Is this go time? ROBERT NELSON( 10:07:39) : At that point, we wanted to find out why. We had all the other evidence leading to that point that she purchased it. She 's the one that poisoned Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:07:49) : The conversation started with pleasantries about Katie 's family farm.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:07:55) : Yeah?( Police interview video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:07:56) : But the detective quickly got down to business. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:07:59) : Here 's where we 're at a crossroad in this case, okay? We 've -- we 've kind of done a lot of work, okay? And we know that your -- your phone is used quite a lot for items in this case, okay? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:08:10) : Mm-Hm.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:08:21) : Nobody else will believe you. ROBERT NELSON( 10:08:23) : Her story changed so many times. We -- we caught her in a lot of lies now.( Interrogation video)( 10:08:26) : You lied to me. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:08:27) : I did n't mean to lie to you. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:08:29) : But you did. ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:08:29) : After a while, they got to the point. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:08:32) : That 's the only thing we need at this point is why. You need to tell me whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick or -- or what? We need to know. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:08:42) : I would n't try to hurt her. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:08:44) : Okay.

KATHY CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:08:46) : No. ANDREA CANNING( 10:08:47) : I know killers come in all shapes and sizes. But Katie does not look like a killer. ROBERT NELSON( 10:08:52) : No. But again, it -- it 's poison. And she had made a comment earlier that it 's a lady 's weapon.( Police interview video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:08:58) : The detectives kept at it. They questioned her for more than six hours. She never asked for an attorney. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:09:05 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Katie. It 's why. Now, please, just tell me why, Katie. Then we can help you. It 's the only thing left. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:09:17) : My life is over. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:09:19) : What drove you to do this, Katie? Was it Adam? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:09:25) : If I go to jail, I 'll go to jail forever.( Police interview video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:09:27) : At one point, she appeared to get sick.

KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:09:36) : I would n't risk my life for this. ROBERT NELSON( 10:09:39) : At the end I had her saying a lot of things, but she would n't admit to actually why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over. But again, she would try to throw it back on Adam. But at this point everything was pointing to her. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:09:51) : I have people who love me. I have a family.( Police interview video of Katie Conley ; Vin and Kathy Conley ; exterior of police station ; police interview room) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:09:56) : Katie 's family was right there at the sheriff 's office with her. Her parents had driven her there thinking investigators needed her to sign a quick deposition -- an hour at most. VIN CONLEY( 10:10:06) : And I went to the window and I said, my daughter is with -- signing papers, she 's supposed to be out half an hour ago. I want to talk to her.

I beat on the door. ANDREA CANNING( 10:10:39) : Wow. VIN CONLEY( 10:10:39) : And finally a sheriff came in. And I says, my daughter 's in there. I says, I want her out now or I want to go in there. Something 's wrong here.( Exterior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:10:50) : It was evening when a detective appeared. VIN CONLEY( 10:10:53) : He comes back out, Kathy and I are at the door, Katie 's not with him. And he said, Katie will not be going home. KATHY CONLEY( 10:11:05) : With you tonight. VIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoder 's death. KATHY CONLEY( 10:11:11) : We know she did it. VIN CONLEY( 10:11:11) : She killed -- we know she did it. She 'll be spending the night in jail. My wife passed out. She did everything, but passed out, I caught her. And then he closes the door. ANDREA CANNING( 10:11:23) : Was this the most helpless you 'd ever felt in your lives as parents? KATHY CONLEY( 10:11:26) : That you ca n't help your child, that you are not in control, that you have absolutely no way to put your arms around her and tell her everything 's going to be okay.( Exterior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:11:39) : Despite what the detective said, they did n't charge Katie that night. She came out, badly shaken, the Conleys helped each other to the car and headed home. VIN CONLEY( 10:11:49) : Katie was sitting in the back seat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I 've ever asked anybody in my life, okay? I says, Katie, did you kill Mary? Did you kill Mary, Katie?

I -- I would n't kill anybody.( Conley family) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:12:17) : It was the answer they expected of course. They say the daughter they raised was no killer. KATHY CONLEY( 10:12:24) : As a mother, you always think that you 're going to get a phone call that your child has been in a car accident or that there 's an illness. But never, ever in your wildest dreams would you think that this would happen, at all. It 's not -- it 's not our daughter.( Conley family) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way. The big sister they 'd looked up to loved animals, would never hurt anyone -- least of all Mary. SHANNON CONLEY( 10:12:55) : Katie had nothing to gain from her death and everything to lose. She lost a mentor, a best friend. No motive. No gain. Nothing. SARAH CONLEY( 10:13:03) : I know her. I know my sister. Katie did not do this.( Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:13:09) : In fact, as word travelled that Katie was the new target of the investigation, no one could make sense of it. Not Mary 's patient, Holly Hilts.( 10:13:19) : Did you believe it? HOLLY HILTS( 10:13:20) : No. Not at all. From what I know of Katie, there 's no reason that she would have done something like that.( Sharon Mills, Sallie Bakert and Janine King) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:13:26) : Mary 's own sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't believe it either. SHARON MILLS( 10:13:33) : No way. Katie? JANINE KING( 10:13:34) : They 're -- SHARON MILLS( 10:13:35) : They ca n't be looking at Katie.

JANINE KING( 10:13:37) : Right.( Exterior of police station) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:13:38) : They phoned the sheriff 's office to say there must be some mistake. JANINE KING( 10:13:42) : We all called them and said, you know, look, we hear there 's another suspect. If by chance, that other suspect is Katie, please, consider the possibility that she may be being framed.( Tamaryn Yoder and Liana Hedge) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:13:56) : Even Mary 's daughters were at a loss. TAMARYN YODER( 10:13:57) : How could this be? How could she -- what do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : It was the hardest person to even wrap your head around that could be involved. ANDREA CANNING( 10:14:09) : What did your dad say when he heard Katie was being looked at as a suspect? LIANA HEDGE( 10:14:13) : He did n't believe it. TAMARYN YODER( 10:14:14) : No.( Robert Nelson) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:14:16) : But investigators were convinced.( 10:14:18) : Were you confident you had the killer?

And everything we had, we had the right person now.( Exterior of courthouse ; Katie Conley in court ; town) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:14:25) : And a grand jury agreed.

LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 10:15:12) : When DATELINE continues.( ANNOUNCEMENTS) ANDREA CANNING( 10:19:20) : So you can obviously come to the fence?

KATIE CONLEY( 10:19:35) : Yes.( Andrea Canning speaking with Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:19:35) : Katie 's lawyer would n't let her answer our questions about the evidence in the case. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( 10:19:40) : No. ANDREA CANNING( 10:19:40) : No, okay.( Photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:19:41) : But she did tell us how much she missed Mary Yoder, her boss and friend.( 10:19:47) : Would you ever have any reason to do anything to Mary? KATIE CONLEY( 10:19:50) : No. No reason ever. We never had so much as a cross word with each other. ANDREA CANNING( 10:19:57) : Did you poison Mary Yoder? KATIE CONLEY( 10:20:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:20:01) : At times Katie seemed overwhelmed by the upcoming trial. KATHY CONLEY( 10:20:05) : Sorry. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( 10:20:09) : Do you want -- UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( 10:20:10) : You want to grab for a minute? ANDREA CANNING( 10:20:10) : Yeah, you 're -- you 're okay, is it -- is it -- KATIE CONLEY( 10:20:13) : Sorry. ANDREA CANNING( 10:20:13) : -- is your anxiety about just what 's coming? KATIE CONLEY( 10:20:17) : It 's hard to know that I 'm innocent and still feel like people want me to be guilty. ANDREA CANNING( 10:20:25) : You do feel that way? KATIE CONLEY( 10:20:33) : I feel like people are n't waiting for facts to come out, and they 're ready to believe whatever they 're told.( Laurie Lisi at courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:20:41) : Oneida County Assistant DA Laurie Lisi was confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:20:47) : We knew it was a circumstantial case, which means it 's always an uphill battle. But we felt like we could connect all the dots.( Courthouse ; courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:20:56) : The courtroom was packed on the first day of Katie 's trial. She sat quietly at the defense table as the prosecution began. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:21:04) : The evidence will show that Kaitlyn Conley --( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:21:06) : Lisi told the jury she had overwhelming evidence that would prove Katie poisoned Mary, starting with the timeline. One by one, Mary 's patients from her last day in the office took the stand. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:21:20) : Was Dr. Mary appearing to be ill at all in the morning? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:21:23) : No, she was n't.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments with Mary before lunch said she was her usual vibrant self. But her patients in the afternoon -- UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:21:34) : Did n't have the big smile on her face. It was very apparent that she -- she was not well and something was wrong.( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:21:41) : But all the patients agreed that Katie was the only other person at work that day. So the prosecutor suggested she was the only one with the opportunity to poison Mary. LAURIE LISI( 10:21:53) : She could 've done whatever she needed to do to put that poison wherever she ultimately put it. BILL YODER( in court)( 10:21:58) : she coded, like, six or seven times.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:22:01) : Bill Yoder, Mary 's husband of thirty-eight years, told the jury about Mary 's agonizing last hours in the hospital. BILL YODER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge tube down her throat and tubes everywhere. And she just looked absolutely terrified.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:22:17) : The prosecutor wanted to quash any lingering rumors that it was Bill who killed Mary. She said Bill was the grieving husband. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:22:25) : So, immediately after your wife passed away, what did you do? BILL YODER( in court)( 10:22:30) : I remember walking out of the -- the hospital door into the sunlight. And the next memory I have af -- after that was, I was sitting on my bed in the dark just crying and crying and it hurt so much.( Liana Hedge and Tamaryn Yoder ; courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:22:49) : Bill 's daughters were relieved their dad had been cleared by investigators. Liana testified for the prosecution that he was a broken man after her mother 's death. LIANA HEDGE( in court)( 10:22:59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw my father cry. But since then, every day pretty much, I saw him cry.( Photo of Mary and Bill Yoder ; Katie Conley ; interior of chiropractor 's office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:23:14) : The prosecutor said it could n't have been Bill. There was so much evidence Katie bought the poison. She was the one who searched for colchicine on her phone. And both Katie 's work computer and work typewriter had been forensically linked to the order. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:23:30) : Imagine that. You 're purchasing colchicine to kill your employer. And you 're doing it while you 're at work. That, ladies and gentlemen, is cold.( 10:23:47) : It was for one gram of colchicine ; is that correct? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:23:50) : Yes.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:23:51) : And this witness, a sales rep for the company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with someone at the Yoder 's practice. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:23:59) : Can you describe that individual 's voice? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:24:02) : It was a female 's voice. It was a soft. It was soft, sweet voice. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:24:11) : Did it sound old or young? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:24:12) : Young.( Photo of Katie Conley ; courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:24:13) : Soft, sweet, young. Who else could that be, asked the prosecutor. But perhaps the most damning evidence was something Katie told detectives. The colchicine was purchased with prepaid credit cards. And in Katie 's police interview, she admitted to buying those cards. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:24:32) : You purchased those credit cards, did n't you? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:24:33) : Yes. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, you 're involved in this.( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of Katie Conley and Adam Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:24:38) : The prosecutor said it had all taken months of painstaking planning. But the question hanging over the courtroom was why? Maybe the e-mail account used to order the poison offered a clue -- mradamyoder1990 @gmail.com The name of her ex-boyfriend. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:24:58) : Kaitlyn Conley wanted Adam Yoder back. And I submit to you, she poisoned Adam Yoder 's mother, her boss, in hopes of bringing Adam Yoder back to her. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:25:12) : Your Honor, the people call Adam Yoder.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:25:15) : Adam told the jury that if Katie was trying to woo him back, her plan worked. He called Katie on the way to the hospital. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:25:22) : Why did you call Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : Because I was panicking and Katie knew my mother.( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:25:30) : Adam said after his mother passed away, he and Katie got back together. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:25:34) : Did you have sexual relations with Kaitlyn Conley on July 25, 2015? ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:25:40) : I did. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:25:40) : Was she helping you through your grief? ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:25:42) : Yes.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:25:43) : But the prosecutor said the relationship collapsed a couple of months later. And that 's when Katie came up with a new plan -- frame Adam for the killing. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:25:53) : Because, ladies and gentlemen, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Vengeance, thy name is Kaitlyn Conley.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:26:06) : The prosecutor said Katie planted the bottle of colchicine in Adam 's car then tipped off authorities. Something she denied in her interview. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:26:15) : So if we say, did you place this under Adam 's seat? Your answer to that is going to be what? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:26:19) : No.( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:26:21) : But a forensic scientist testified Adam 's DNA was not on the bottle 's wrapper. Katie 's was. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:26:27) : The major contributor of that cardboard wrapper matched the DNA profile from Kaitlyn Conley.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:26:33) : It was an outlandish crime, the prosecutor said, so cruel, so cold. LAURIE LISI( 10:26:39) : Her ultimate revenge was not only to take away his mother, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for it.( Photo of Katie Conley and Adam Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( 10:26:47) : Do you believe Katie Conley killed your mother? TAMARYN YODER( 10:26:50) : Absolutely. LIANA HEDGE( 10:26:50) : Yes. Yes. TAMARYN YODER( 10:26:52) : There is no doubt.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:26:55) : But Katie 's defense said they were wrong. Far from being a criminal mastermind, it was Katie who had been framed -- and a surprising relationship was about to be exposed.( 10:27:07) : What 's going through your mind when you learn of this relationship? SHARON MILLS( 10:27:11) : Unbelievable.( Courtroom proceedings) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 10:27:13) : Coming up -- UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:27:14) : He was kissing her and it was very intense.( Photos of courtroom proceedings) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 10:27:19) : -- a bombshell explodes in court. Mary 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : That 's when we really started thinking seriously that Bill did it.( ANNOUNCEMENTS)( Exterior of courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:30:46) : On day eleven of Katie Conley 's trial, the defense began its case. Rooting for her were some unlikely supporters. Three of Mary 's sisters.( 10:30:56) : She 's on trial for murdering your sister, and you 're standing behind the defendant. JANINE KING( 10:31:01) : The defense. I know, it is very -- ANDREA CANNING( 10:31:02) : The alleged killer? JANINE KING( 10:31:02) : -- unusual situation. Right. But we just felt like this is the last thing our sister would 've wanted. SALLIE BAKERT( 10:31:08) : That 's right.( Photo of Kathy ; Sharon Mills ; photo of Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:31:10) : But there was another sister who was n't sitting on the defense 's side, a sister they did n't talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out she is the woman Bill started dating so quickly and, some said, so suspiciously after Mary 's death. Sharon was the first to figure it out. Kathy had been hard to get ahold of in the weeks after Mary died. And Bill had been going out of town. SHARON MILLS( 10:31:36) : I said, oh, gee, maybe they 're off together, just kind of throwing it out there, flippantly. And Janine went, do you think? ANDREA CANNING( 10:31:44) : What 's going through your mind when you learn of this relationship? SHARON MILLS( 10:31:48) : Unbelievable. JANINE KING( 10:31:50) : Yeah. I mean, that 's when we really started thinking seriously that Bill did it.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:31:57) : And that 's exactly what the defense wanted the jury to think. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( in court)( 10:32:01) : You will find motive through the testimony on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:32:07) : In court, Katie 's attorney Christopher Pelli told the jury that Mary 's killer was n't Katie. It was Bill. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:32:14) : He really is the only person that I can, in good heart and faith, say had motive to -- to actually kill his wife.( Photo of Bill and Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:32:26) : According to the defense, Bill was no grieving widower. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( in court)( 10:32:30) : Do you remember the first time that you had sexual relations with Kathy Richmond? BILL YODER( in court)( 10:32:38) : I do n't remember the date, no. I do n't -- I was n't keeping a journal.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:32:42) : Bill said in court the same thing his text messages seemed to confirm for detectives, the romance with his wife 's sister only started after Mary died. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was asked the same question. KATHY RICHMOND( in court)( 10:32:56) :( 10:32:56) : The romantic relationship began sometime in September. Late September, mid-September.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:33:05) : But this woman, one of Kathy 's neighbors, told a different story. She said she 'd seen the two kissing on Kathy 's porch a couple of weeks before Mary 's death. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:33:15) : Bill was holding Kathy and he was kissing her and looking in her eyes and I -- it was very intense.( Photo of Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:33:25) : The defense said not only did Bill have a new relationship, he 'd just received a big pile of money, too. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( in court)( 10:33:31) : I have to ask you how much you -- you inherited in total from your father 's estate? BILL YODER( in court)( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:33:39) : In the eyes of the defense, that made Mary expendable. JANINE KING( 10:33:43) : Mary had been the primary breadwinner for quite a long time. He 'd gotten an inheritance. Now, he no longer needed Mary.( Photo of Mary and Bill Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:33:51) : And the defense wanted the jury to know that Bill never called for an investigation. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( in court)( 10:33:55) : Bill is at fault for not going to the police.( Photo of Mary and Bill Yoder ; exterior of chiropractor 's office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:34:01) : So, if Bill had motive, did he also have opportunity? Bill denied he was in the office the day Mary got sick. Remember, her patients had n't seen him. But Katie 's defense said that did n't mean he was n't there. This witness used to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @)( 10:34:19) : Do you remember specifically ever being told I do n't want anybody to know that I 'm here? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:34:24) : Sometimes he might say, you know, do n't let -- do n't tell the patient I 'm here because they might want to see me.( Exterior of hospital ; Jeanna Marraffa) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:34:31) : The defense also suggested Bill had a second opportunity to harm his wife when he was by her side at the hospital. Toxicologist Jeanna Marraffa told the jury she could n't rule out that Mary got a second dose of poison. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:34:46) : If there was a second dose, then there 's no possibility -- no possibility that Kaitlyn could have been involved, because she did n't have access to -- to Mary at that particular time. ANDREA CANNING( 10:34:55) : Did you feel that this case was just swimming in reasonable doubt? CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:34:59) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.( Courtroom proceedings ; photos of interior of office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:35:02) : The defense told the jury there was an innocent explanation for much of the state 's case against Katie. Katie 's DNA had been found on the colchicine bottle. But, as office manager, she handled everything delivered to the practice. As for the sales rep who said she 'd talked to a woman with a sweet young voice -- CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:35:21) : Dr. Mary Yoder is rather soft spoken and young sounding and very vibrant herself.( Photos of interior of office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:35:27) : And think about this, the defense attorney told the jury Bill had access to Katie 's work computer and office typewriter.( 10:35:35) : If Bill were to frame Katie, you believe it would n't be all that hard? CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:35:41) : No. I mean, Katie worked at -- at -- at the office. He -- he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances that led to her being charged.( Search results) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:35:56) : But what about those searches for colchicine on Katie 's phone?( 10:36:00) : How do you get around that? She 's looking up this very rare drug that I had never heard of until I started working on this story. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:36:06) : The prosecution could n't say that Katie searched this particular term prior to Mary 's death. It was -- it appeared that it was afterwards.( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley ; Conley sister) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:36:14) : The defense said the evidence against Katie was n't there and the state 's motive? Preposterous. The idea that Katie killed Mary to get back together with Adam did n't make any sense, he said. According to her sisters, she was the one who initially dumped him. SARAH CONLEY( 10:36:31) : Finally, she just had enough. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter ; photo of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:36:36) : As for the anonymous letter pointing the finger at Adam, the defense never explained why Katie wrote it if Bill was the real killer. But he wanted the jury to see the lengths Katie had gone to help the investigation, enduring hours of intense questioning.( 10:36:52) : You wanted the jury to know how cooperative Katie was with the authorities. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:36:56) : Yes. Yes, I did. She had the opportunity on, I believe, seven different occasions to say, you know what? I want an attorney. But instead, she continued to cooperate and be subjected to some pretty severe interrogation tactics. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( interrogation video)( 10:37:14) : Then if you did n't do it, you know who did it. KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:37:16) : I do n't know.( 10:37:18) : I would n't risk my life for this.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiceover)( 10:37:20) : Detectives lied to Katie about some of the evidence. That 's why the defense said the jury should ignore anything Katie said during that interview. CHRISTOPHER PELLI( in court)( 10:37:29) : Do you think that your daughter -- your twenty-three-year-old could give an accurate statement under those conditions? I -- I -- not.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:37:39) : Detectives say their techniques were by the book. But Mary 's sister Sharon could n't believe what Katie went through. SHARON MILLS( 10:37:46) : At that point, I wished that I had never called for an investigation.( Sallie Bakert, Sharon Mills and Janine King) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:37:50) : Sharon was more convinced than ever that Katie was innocent and Bill guilty. She said as much in open court. SHARON MILLS( in court)( 10:37:57) : It is still my theory that he killed my sister. LAURIE LISI( in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:38:01) : What if you 're wrong? What if she really did do this? Have you thought about that? JANINE KING( 10:38:05) : We just -- SALLIE BAKERT( 10:38:06) : Every once in a while and -- it 's just -- just so not -- JANINE KING( 10:38:10) : We have tried to wrap -- SALLIE BAKERT( 10:38:12) : -- true that -- yeah. JANINE KING( 10:38:12) : -- our heads around it a thousand ways -- SALLIE BAKERT( 10:38:13) : Yeah. JANINE KING( 10:38:14) : -- to see if there 's any way possible that we think she could 've done this. And it just does n't make sense. SALLIE BAKERT( 10:38:19) : No. JANINE KING( 10:38:20) : We do n't believe she did this. SALLIE BAKERT( 10:38:21) : No.( Courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:38:22) : But what would the jury think? There was one more surprise to come. LESTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:38:30) : I actually thought that that we 'd have a verdict in fifteen or twenty minutes of not guilty.( Courtroom proceedings ; exterior of courthouse) LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 10:38:35) : -- deliberations defy predictions. The wait for a decision would take far longer than that. SHARON MILLS( 10:38:42) : We were totally terrified. LESTER HOLT( voiceover)( 10:38:44) : When DATELINE continues.( ANNOUNCEMENTS)( Courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:41:41) : It was up to a jury to decide if Katie Conley was Mary 's killer. In the courthouse, Mary 's divided family waited. Her husband and children on one side, three of her sisters on the other, still in Katie 's corner. SHARON MILLS( 10:41:56) : Janine and I both have daughters in their twenties. We were totally terrified for her.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:42:02) : But defense attorney Chris Pelli was confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I actually thought that after I gave my closing, that we 'd have a verdict in fifteen or twenty minutes of not guilty. ANDREA CANNING( 10:42:13) : What was it like waiting for the verdict? CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:42:16) : Oh, well, the first twenty minutes were okay. But then it went on for day one and day two.( Exterior of courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:42:22) : Two days became three. What were they talking about in there? The detective hoped the jury would see past the pretty, put-together young woman in court.( 10:42:32) : Was Katie really what she seemed? ROBERT NELSON( 10:42:34) : Katie, I believe, has another side to her, other than this side that everybody sees from her, that she presents to everybody. ANDREA CANNING( 10:42:40) : If this is true, this is a diabolical side? ROBERT NELSON( 10:42:43) : Yes. An evil side. ANDREA CANNING( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. LIANA HEDGE( 10:42:47) : There was another side of Katie that we had not known was there. TAMARYN YODER( 10:42:52) : Right.( Exterior of courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:42:54) : The jury deliberated all through day four. And on day five, they passed a note to the judge. JUDGE( 10:43:00) : This will be a hung jury.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:43:04) : There was no verdict. The crowd went silent. Afterwards, Katie 's attorney spoke to some jurors. They told him eight of them wanted to acquit Katie, and that the weakest part of the state 's case was Bill.( 10:43:19) : Did you feel that they were believing that he was lying? CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:43:22) : They told me under no uncertain circumstances that he was full of it.( Bill Yoder at courthouse ; exterior of courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:43:28) : But Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He told DATELINE he did not poison Mary and had nothing to do with her death. And no matter what Katie 's defense thinks, he can never be charged. As a witness at Katie 's grand jury hearing, he was given automatic immunity from prosecution.( 10:43:48) : No matter what happens, is he protected for life? CHRISTOPHER PELLI( 10:43:50) : For life, forever. Forever.( Tamaryn Yoder and Liana Hedge) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:43:52) : Mary 's daughters were thankful for that. The accusations against their father had made the trial even more painful. LIANA HEDGE( 10:44:00) : It was just one malicious attack after another. My dad had never attacked anyone -- TAMARYN YODER( 10:44:05) : No. LIANA HEDGE( 10:44:05) : -- in his life. He was just a broken, seventy-year- old man that was barely functioning.( Exterior of courthouse) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:44:13) : Now, they prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : There was no hesitation. We were going back. We were retrying the case.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:44:31) : All rise.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:44:33) : The prosecutor 's case was virtually the same. She said everything investigators unearthed pointed to Katie as Mary 's killer. LAURIE LISI( in court)( 10:44:41) : The evidence will show that all roads lead to Kaitlyn Conley.( Courtroom proceedings ; photo of Katie Conley ; courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:44:47) : But Katie had a new defense attorney and a new twist to her strategy. He said, yes, Katie was innocent. And yes, Katie was framed. But this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at someone else. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:45:04) : Ladies and gentlemen, it was Adam.

Defense attorney Frank Policelli argued that the crime happened just the way Katie described in that letter.( Colchicine bottle) FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:45:16) : He put the colchicine in her supplements when he was over there either Mother 's Day or Father 's Day, when he had a falling out.( Digital logs ; receipt ; photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:45:25) : As for how Katie 's digital fingerprints ended up on everything related to the colchicine transaction, Katie 's attorney suggested that could easily have been Adam.

In the years since Mary 's death, David had come to doubt Adam, and defend Katie.( 10:45:58) : Do you believe Katie had anything to do with the murder of Mary Yoder? DAVID KING( 10:46:02) : No. Not at all.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:46:06) : On the stand, David told the jury Adam was no novice with computers.

David testified he saw Adam with Katie 's laptop. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:46:29) : And how do you know he had her laptop? DAVID KING( in court)( 10:46:31) : I had asked him about it, since it was in a flowery laptop sleeve and it had a picture of a Victorian background. That just did n't suit Adam 's character, so I asked him about it. He said it was Katie 's.( Courtroom proceedings ; chiropractor 's office) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:46:43) : And the defense said Adam had access to Katie 's work computer, too. David testified that years earlier, he and Adam used to drop by the office when no one else was there. DAVID KING( 10:46:54) : I had helped Adam clean the office a number of times. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:46:56) : Do n't think that Adam did n't have free reign of that office, ladies and gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to, okay?( Courtroom proceedings ; police interview video of Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:47:04) : And the defense said there was something else. Something important. Remember in her interview with detectives how fearful Katie said she was of Adam? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:47:13) : You ca n't protect me. ROBERT NELSON( interrogation video)( 10:47:15) : Protect you from what, Adam? KATIE CONLEY( interrogation video)( 10:47:16) : Yeah.( Police interview video of Katie Conley ; photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:47:16) : Katie 's attorney said there was a good reason for Katie to be afraid. He said Adam had abused Katie, both physically and sexually. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:47:26) : He beat her. He hit her. He raped her. He used her. Why would n't she be scared of him?( Exterior of police station ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : A year before Mary 's death, Katie filed a police report accusing Adam of rape.

FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:47:44) : " You grabbed my right wrist and said you 'd snap my wrist and break every one of my fingers. I 'm going to kill you. I 'm going to kill you, Katie. The way you said it, the way you looked at me -- and then I was afraid. "( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:47:57) : Adam denied the allegation, and Katie dropped the complaint. But the defense hoped the jury would see Katie as a victim, not as a killer. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:48:07) : There 's no motive in this case. She loved Mary Yoder, and there 's nothing in this case to indicate that her actions were anything order than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:48:18) : The people call Adam Yoder to the stand.( Adam Yoder in court) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:48:22) : Adam Yoder had given his side of the story to investigators early on.

But at trial number two, the alternate suspect right from the start was Mary 's son. FRANK POLICELLI( in court)( 10:51:59) : Ladies and gentlemen, it was Adam. It was Adam. ANDREA CANNING( 10:52:03) : Did it feel like your brother was on trial? LIANA HEDGE( 10:52:05) : Oh, yes, absolutely. And it just was one allegation after another.( Adam Yoder in court) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:52:11) : Now, in court Adam took the stand to respond to the defense firsthand. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:52:16) : Good morning.

A prosecution computer expert said Katie 's devices had never been hacked. And Adam told the jury he was hardly the hacker Katie 's side portrayed. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:52:35) : Do you have hacking skills? Are you able to break into systems? ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:52:38) : No, I do not, and no, I am not.( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:52:39) : To the defense 's claim that Adam physically abused Katie, he did admit to one incident. ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:52:46) : I snapped and I slapped her a few times. I regretted it immediately. I left the house.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:52:54) : But as for the alleged rape, no charges were ever filed against Adam. And he told the jury he had zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drinking heavily. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:53:06) : So was this essentially a blackout period? ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:53:08) : Yes, it was.( Photo of Adam Yoder and Katie Conley) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:53:10) : He said the next morning things seemed fine between them. It was n't until about three months later that Katie accused him in that graphic text message. ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:53:19) : I was in shock. I did n't know how to react. And I was panicking. Ultimately, I had drank enough to black out that night, so I could n't defend myself. I did n't have a version of the story to say to -- to her in response.( Courtroom proceedings ; bottle) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:53:36) : But Adam did have a story about Katie, an accusation of his own. And it was a stunner. Adam suggested Katie might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's death, he said Katie handed him a bottle of supplements to help him get through final exams. ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:53:54) : She told me it 's to help basically focus, boost memory. She said make sure I take it consecutively and consistently because it works better over time.( Exterior of hospital) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:54:07) : After taking the pills, Adam said he became so sick, he had to go to the ER. ADAM YODER( 10:54:12) : The vomiting and the pain. I started experiencing severe abdomen pain and eventually severe back pain as well.( Exterior of hospital) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:54:21) : That 's just how Mary 's illness began.( 10:54:23) : Do you believe that Katie gave him -- TAMARYN YODER( 10:54:24) : Absolutely. ANDREA CANNING( 10:54:24) : -- something that made him sick? LIANA HEDGE( 10:54:26) : Absolutely.( Courtroom proceedings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 10:54:27) : Katie 's defense said she had nothing to do with Adam 's illness. In fact, the state 's own lab experts tested the remaining supplements in the bottle and found no poison. But the prosecution 's suggestion was clear -- maybe Katie tried out the colchicine on Adam first. ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:54:46) : I asked her if she had poisoned me in a joking way. UNIDENTIFIED MAN( in court)( 10:54:48) : And what did she say? ADAM YODER( in court)( 10:54:51) : That, no, she would never hurt me.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:54:52) : Like his father, Adam had full immunity from prosecution, and he was also cleared by investigators.

ADAM YODER( in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:55:10) : And there was one last discovery that pointed away from Adam. Right before the second trial, the state 's computer experts got their hands on a digital backup of Katie 's phone. In the files, they found evidence of more incriminating searches. LAURIE LISI( 10:55:26) : Before she actually honed in on colchicine, she looked at arsenic, she looked at thallium, she looked at cyanide.( In court)( 10:55:35) : I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the evidence is clear, and that the common denominator is this defendant, Kaitlyn Conley.( Courtroom proceedings ; jury box ; photo of Conley family) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:55:47) : Once again, Katie 's fate was in the hands of a jury, twelve men and women who would either send her to prison for much of her life, or home to her family, a free woman. KATHY CONLEY( 10:55:59) : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what she did. This is not her. She 's the same, nice, nurturing, helping person that she was and always has been.( Exterior of courthouse ; photo of Katie Conley and photo of Mary Yoder ; exterior of courthouse ; courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:56:14) : The charge was second degree murder. But after all that testimony and over the objections of the defense, the judge allowed the jury to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter. To convict, the jury would only have to find that Katie intended to hurt Mary, not kill her. A day passed without word. On day two, the judge received a note. JUDGE( in court)( 10:56:38) : The note reads " hung jury. "( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:56:40) : It was looking like another mistrial. The thought was exasperating for Mary 's children. LIANA HEDGE( 10:56:47) : We almost got to the point -- TAMARYN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:56:48) : -- where we 're, like, we were -- you know, is this all ever going to be worth it?( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:56:53) : The judge encouraged the jury to keep trying. JUDGE( in court)( 10:56:56) : I urge that each of you make every possible effort.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:57:01) : And just two hours later -- JUDGE( in court)( 10:57:03) : The record will reflect that the jury has reentered the courtroom indicating that they have reached a verdict.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:57:09) : First, the most serious charge. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:57:11) : Murder in the second degree, how do you find the defendant? Guilty or not guilty? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:57:16) : Not guilty.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:57:17) : Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime that could send her to prison for up to twenty five years? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:57:24) : Guilty or not guilty? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:57:26) : Guilty.( Courtroom proceedings) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:57:29) : As Katie absorbed the news, her mom had to be escorted out in tears. Katie tried to reassure her family. But her sisters were distraught. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN( in court)( 10:57:41) : Katie, we love you. We love you.( Sallie Bakert, Janine King and Sharon Mills ; Katie Conley in court) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:57:44) : As were Mary 's sisters. Without them, an investigation may never have happened. Now, someone they thought was innocent was headed to prison. JANINE KING( 10:57:53) : Well, you know, there 'll be an appeal and we 'll be involved in that. And do whatever we can. ANDREA CANNING( 10:57:58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? SALLIE BAKERT( 10:58:00) : Have to. JANINE KING( 10:57:59) : Yes. SHARON MILLS( 10:57:59) : Oh, definitely. ANDREA CANNING( 10:58:01) : Was justice done with the guilty verdict? LIANA HEDGE( 10:58:04) : There 's an accountability. TAMARYN YODER( 10:58:05) : Yes, she did not -- LIANA HEDGE( 10:58:06) : And -- TAMARYN YODER( 10:58:06) : -- get away with it.( Courthouse ; photo of Mary and Bill Yoder and kids) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:58:09) : Mary 's daughters are relieved the trial is over but they mourn the family they once had. So many lives shattered.( 10:58:17) : This destroyed an entire family. LIANA HEDGE( 10:58:20) : Yeah. TAMARYN YODER( 10:58:20) : Not just whole family. ANDREA CANNING( 10:58:20) : Not just the death, but -- TAMARYN YODER( 10:58:21) : Not just our family. It destroyed her family. It destroyed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to finally be able to go back to the -- the good memories and not have to relive the worst one. We want to be able to actually celebrate her life.( Photos of Mary Yoder) ANDREA CANNING( voiceover)( 10:58:40) : Mary 's loved ones may be divided over who killed her, but there 's one thing they can agree on. It 's not how Mary died that should be remembered. It 's how she lived. LIANA HEDGE( 10:58:52) : She could light up any room, any situation. I mean, she was there for you no matter what. No matter when you called -- TAMARYN YODER( 10:58:57) : Mm-Hm. LIANA HEDGE( 10:58:58) : -- no matter what you needed your mom for.
