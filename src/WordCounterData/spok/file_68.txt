231941 HOST : Rush Limbaugh @!EXECUTIVE-PRODUCER : Roger Ailes Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rush Limbaugh. @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH : Thank you. Thank you. Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. Thank you. Oops. Nice, is n't it? Thank you so much. Thanks, everybody, and happy Thanksgiving. We are ready for another week of televised broadcast excellence right here on @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH, the television show -- a lot of fun, a lot of truth tonight, all wrapped into one loveable bundle. Let 's get started. I just want to show you me from October 25th, right here on this very program, in this very chair at this very table. Take a look. @(Excerpt-from-RUS) @!LIMBAUGH : They have no option other than to scare people, to fearmonger, because they have no proposal of their own. It 's all about the budget debate, which is going to come to a -- a -- probably a -- a finality this week, and it 'll be very interesting to see who caves, the Republicans or the president. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for victory. @(End-of-excerpt) @!LIMBAUGH : And, my friends, once again, right on the money was I, and we 're going to take some time during this program to explain who caved, and it was -- there 's no question about it. But I do n't care if -- if -- what -- what you 've seen in the press and on television so far today, there 's no question who caved here. It was the -- the Democrats and the president. And we 'll show you why and how as the program progresses. Here 's how The Washington Post treated it, however, in their headline on Monday : Clinton and Congress Agree on Outlines of Budget Goals ; Workers Return Today. That 's not an accurate headline. I mean, it 's accurate as far as what was actually published. But that headline is not accurate as to the truth of the news. We, ladies and gentlemen, with our crack staff, have prepared some headlines that The Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to you now. Here is the first one : Clinton Caves, Accepts GOP Budget Goals ; Democrat Mutiny Threatened President With Veto Override. Leave that up for just a second. See that Democrat Mutiny? What happened last week -- 48 Democrats joined with Republicans conceptually supporting a balanced budget, scored by CBO, in seven years, and it was up to 50 by the weekend and was going to go even higher. So many Democrats were preparing to join the Republicans on this that it looked like they 'd have enough votes to override a veto. Now here 's another thing. All the polling data that you 've seen -- USA Today-CNN, CBS-New York Times, NBC-Wall Street Journal -- you pick it, you name it. Every poll has shown that the public blames the Republicans. Every poll says that Clinton is rising in approval ratings. Yet, there are internal polls in the White House which show that Clinton was losing support. You couple their reality with those shifting Democrats to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided they had to -- to make amends here and cave. Now this should tell you a lot about polling. NBC News-Wall Street Journal, ABC-Washington Post, CBS-New York Times, CNN-USA Today, Gallup -- what are these polls for anyway? You would think that they would wish to accurately portray public opinion, but they do n't. They are for two things : They are to create news, and they are to shape public opinion, not reflect it. And that 's where they got caught short. So the true polls, the ones they had in the White House showing the president losing support, coupled with those 48 Democrats, hence the mutiny in our headline -- that 's one of the keys to understanding what happened here. Here 's another headline that could have easily been in The Washington Post : Now You 're Throwing Us Overboard, ' Representative Major Owens Claims -- Slams Clinton ; Claims White House Tossing Democrats To Sharks. You could have seen that. How about this one : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New GOP Governor Praises Gingrich, Dole ; Urges Tax Cuts. These -- this -- by the way, every one of these headlines represents the truth. Here 's this one : Market To Republicans : Three Cheers ; GOP Stands Firm, Dow Rallies Within 10 Points of 5,000 Mark. Another one : Democrats Puzzled ; Shutdown Went Unnoticed, Somehow -- Somehow Life Goes on for Most Americans ; News Analysis by E.J. Dionne Jr. And finally, this one : Where 's Hillary ; First Lady -- First Lady Desperately Needed at Moment of Crisis, by Mary McGrory. These are just some of the headlines that should have been on the front page of The Washington Post. Now let 's leave this for just a second, at least in its direct confrontation, and -- and move on to an ancillary aspect of all of this. On Saturday in The New York Times, there was this story : Talk Radio 's Conservatives Enlist in the Budget Battle. You see it was written by Michael Janofsky, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times. He 's now in the Washington bureau. And in this story, which was rife with the -- the veiled slurs at talk radio, the veiled attempts to impugn the integrity of those who engage in talk radio -- not just the hosts, but the callers as well, as well as listeners -- there was this sentence : Some of the hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, have begun urging listeners to call the White House with their complaints. Not true, ladies and gentlemen ; therefore, anything you see in The New York Times written by Michael Janofsky, you should immediately and henceforth discount. I never once, ever, gave out the White House phone number. I do n't even know what it is off the top of my head -- did not give it out, never urged people to call ; only said to call the White Ho -- or the -- the Capitol Hill switchboard and ask for your elected official and tell them you support them. Now I put together a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they probably will not print it, I want you to read it here on this show, and I will read it to you. And this is -- we faxed it over to them on Monday afternoon. If they print it, probably get four sentences of it, if any of it, but here 's what it is just so you 'll know. Dear Sirs, I know these are tough days for The New York Times. Your circulation is falling. Your editorials go unheeded by the president of the United States. It takes a great deal of energy and effort to not cover monumental Republican successes. I feel your pain. ' But -- wait a minute. Wait a minute. But this is no time to make draconian cuts in your reporting standards. I refer to " Battle Over the Budget Talk Radio " by Michael Janofsky, November 18th, ' 95, which asserts, quote, " Some of the radio hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, have begun urging listeners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In other words, the central factual assertion about me in the article is factually incorrect. I did not give out the White House phone number or urge listeners to call it, especially to complain. My program 's totally based on uplift, optimism and good cheer. What I did do is this -- and read closely, Mr. Janofsky. For only the third time in my star-studded seven-year broadcast career, I gave out the Capitol Hill 's switchboard number for listeners who wanted to convey to Republicans encouragement and support. I did this in an attempt to counter the weight of anti-Republican fervor in the mainstream media, including the venerable New York Times, which has been busy manipulating polls in an effort to convict Republicans of starving children and the elderly. @!Mr-Janofsky-quoted# Well, for the good of the country and the credibility of The New York Times, I suggest Mr. Janofsky actually listen to my program. His mood will greatly improve, as will his reporting. Sincerely, Rush Limbaugh, broadcast raconteur. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, right there. Now it may seem like a minor thing to you, but one of the things that I have to endure constantly are these never-ending assaults from so-called critics who are out there saying I twist facts, that I shave corners on the truth, that I make things up to fit my mold, that I do n't care about accuracy and so forth, and it comes from people like this who claim a holier-than-thou attitude to accuracy and everything else. So whenever you have a chance to refute it and set the record straight, you do it, and that 's -- that 's what this is. And again, I do n't know if any or much of this letter will ever be published. But at least you, the people who count most to me, will know that I did respond to it and will be able to take it yourself and respond to others who offer similar such criticisms which are also baseless. When we come back, ladies and gentlemen, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still doubting it out there, wondering who won and who caved, you wo n't when we finish, so just be patient. We 'll be right back. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. I 'll take it, but I am stunned. I generally expect robust applause after making a brilliant point. All I was doing was sitting here. But we move on, ladies and gentlemen. I 'm not so psychologically insecure that I 'm now obsessed with wondering why they were applauding so loud. I 'll just accept it, as the secure individual that I am. Many of you still -- Gee, Rush, I hope it 's true. I hope it was Clinton that caved. I hope it was n't the Republicans that caved. Please, please tell me. ' Now I -- we 're going to offer all sorts of evidence, but some of the best evidence we can give you is visual. Let 's first show you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the agreement was made. Take a look. Senator PETE DOMENICI( Republican, New Mexico) : Well, we 're going to -- we 're going to say hi. We 're going to say great. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Look at that. @!Sen-DOMENICI : Look, this guy 's contagious, right? Even -- even his -- what 's, see, you 're -- you 're my son, is that it? Representative JOHN KASICH( Republican, Ohio) : No, no, no. Partner. @!Sen-DOMENICI : Partner. OK. @!LIMBAUGH : See, they 're happy. They 're partners. They 're high-fiving ' everybody. They 're having a grand old time. Now shortly after that, Leon Panetta, the White House chief of shaft -- staff -- White House chief of staff and some of the other liberal Democrats on Capitol Hill got together for a press conference. Now you take a look at these long, gloomy faces, folks. Watch this. @!Mr-LEON-PANETTA-@1 : See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read you the two offers that we made to the Republicans. I -- these are just...( unintelligible) some movement in the -- in the effort to try to arrive at a solution here. @!LIMBAUGH : Oh, man. Now if you -- if -- if that does n't tell you -- folks, if that does n't tell you -- these people are -- they 're about -- they 're pretty low. They -- they 're pretty down in the dumps. Now let me give you some on-the-spot analysis from me to explain this to you. The first thing that -- I think it 's important to understand is that the president has not submitted a balanced budget. He talks about having submitted one, but he has not. He submitted a budget but it does n't balance. He 's got $ 200 billion deficits. The most recent budget from the president spends $ 876 trillion a year more than the Republican budget. Now I think this is a good thing because for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer. There 's nothing in their hands that they can say, Hey, this is what we want. This is what we 're for. ' All they can do is point fingers of blame at the Republican plan and -- and try to malign it. And that 's not going to get them anywhere in the long haul. Because now, for the first time, the president has agreed to a seven-year time frame. He has agreed to CBO scoring which was the -- the total term of the deal, the -- were the total terms of the deal as offered by Mr. Newt and the Republican leadership last week. And for the first time the president is now going to have to come forth with what he says a balanced budget will be. He 's going to have to go on the record. The people of this country want a balanced budget. Even those polls which showed this skewed percentage of people who think the Republicans are to blame for this meaningless government shutdown, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world. And everybody 's running, I 'm going to have cold sandwiches instead of hot turkey for Thanksgiving. ' They 're going to get retroactive pay. And the biggest joke in the world was that we closed the Grand Canyon. Can you believe that? Only in -- only in a liberal-dominated bureaucracy do you have people vain enough to think they could actually close the hugest hole in the ground in the world. It would be like them saying, If we do n't get what we want, we 're going to turn off the sun, ' you know. They could n't do that either. So today, The Grand Canyon reopened, ' as though -- What? They put a big tarp over it and raised the thing today so people are going to look at it? It 's just a joke. Now another thing : 48 Democrats left -- and it was more than that -- 48 Democrats left the Democratic Party and joined the Republicans in voting for the Republican concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal polls of the White House showed that the president was losing ground. He 's holding a losing hand, folks. He 's holding a losing hand. All he can do -- and he will do it and we 're going to show you a clip in a moment to show you that he is doing it -- all he can do is to say that he held out and he took on the extremists, and now finally the Republicans have come to agree with him. That 's all he can say. But there 's something crucial you 've got to understand. People ask me all the time, Rush, who do you want the presidential candidate to be on the Republican side? ' I 've said, I do n't care. It does n't matter. ' And you know why? My friends, in all candor, this is more important than the presidential election of 1996. And the Republican leadership had better realize it and get in campaign mode, not just sit there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also run a campaign for the minds and hearts of the American voter and the American citizen, because the Democrats have been doing that for the last month with those phony Medicare ads. This is the campaign. The Democrats know it. Clinton 's running for re-election. That 's what this is all about. And the Republicans had better realize that this is vastly more important than the 1996 presidential elections, because that -- that election will be irrelevant if this effort fails because we 'll never get back to this point, certainly not by 1996 presidential elections. We 'll have more, same subject, right after this break, so do n't go away. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : We have shown you the Republican gleeful response ; we 've shown you the Democratic funereal response to this deal. Now let 's go to the White House and show you a key passage from the president 's press conference announcing the deal. This is very key, folks. Listen carefully to everything you hear. President BILL CLINTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time, the Republican leaders in Congress... @!LIMBAUGH :( In inset) What? @!Pres-CLINTON :... have acknowledged the importance of those principles. @!LIMBAUGH :( In inset) What principles? @!Pres-CLINTON : As I have said throughout this debate, I could only agree to move forward if that occurred. Tonight represents the first sign of their willingness to move forward without forcing unacceptable cuts in health care, education and the environment on the American people. @!LIMBAUGH : Now you see, folks, first off, his principles -- as though we know what they are. But he said -- he said, Tonight represents the first time the Republicans have committed to not harming Medicare, have not done this. ' This proves my prediction. He 's warded off the extremists. But here 's the truth. The Republican budget increases spending on health care and it always has. The Republican budget increases spending on the " environment, " however the hell you do that, and it always has. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than we are spending now. But here 's the president saying, For the first time, the Republicans have agreed not to harm Medicare. ' This is what you 're going to have to weed your way through, all of this. I mean, this is an intricate web of deceit that he 's beginning to spin here. The only leg up we have is that we knew it was hum -- coming. Why did we know it was coming? Because we have me to sit here and tell you. I 'm tell -- folks, I 'm telling you, it 's -- it 's true. This is key. This proves -- by the way, it also proves another thing. He 's moving to the right. He 's going to sign this thing because he just spelled out, The Republicans, for the first time agreed ' -- but -- so what 's in it is good now? Well, here 's the plan. This is the agreement. I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what he says for the first time the Republicans have signed onto. The president and the Congress shall enact legislation in the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office ' -- all of those are Republican demands -- and the president and the Congress agree the balanced budget must protect future generations ' -- the Republican budget already does -- ensure Medicare solvency ' -- Republican budget already does -- reform welfare ' -- Republican budget already does -- and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, natural defense -- national defense, veterans, the environment ' -- Republican budget already does. And who could oppose any of this stuff anyway? Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help working families and to stimulate future economic growth. ' The Republican budget already does. They 've, in essence, signed on. Now you 've heard all the ifs ' in the agreement. Did you hear any ifs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around saying, There 's a lot of ifs in the agreement. ' There 's not one if. I 've got paragraph B here and I 'm not going to waste my time to read it to you, but trust me, my friends, there are zero ifs. There are no ifs in this thing. It is amazing the degree to which the willing accomplices in the press will join the doom and gloom bunch in the White House to spread a bunch of myths. Well, we 'll talk a break. We 'll be back and close all this out right after this break so do n't go away. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : Hey, remember, folks, in all candor, this budget fight is the 1996 eles -- election issue. It is more important than that election. It must be looked at as an election and fought that way. We 'll have more on it as our subsequent shows air. See you next time. Bye-bye.
