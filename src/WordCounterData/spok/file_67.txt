Oh, gee. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. RUSH -- welcome to @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH, the TV show. Great to see you. Thanks very much. You may now be seated. A lot of people have been asking me, Rush, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote back when he was a student that the military was fascist? ' And it 's the same reaction I have to Ricki Lake and that stupid publicity stunt of hers with PETA. He was just young and stupid at the time and did n't know what he was saying and it 's not that big a deal. Same thing as Ricki Lake. My friends, also, I got to tell you, I was getting made up only moments ago, and Deborah, the commie-babe makeup artist, soon as I sat down -- where is she -- is she -- there she is -- coming -- as soon as she hears her name, she comes in from behind the wall. Is he mentioning my name again? ' Anyway, you made up Coach Ditka over the weekend. Deborah -- he was doing some infomercial for a pharmaceutical company on Saturday here in New York, and somehow the word leaked that she was my makeup stylist, and Coach Ditka found out about it and said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. ' Is that what he said? Is that... @!DEBORAH-@1Makeup-A : Yes, that 's what he said. @!LIMBAUGH : I have to tell you, folks, I had the greatest time Sunday. I was invited this past summer any day I wanted to accept the invitation -- any Sunday -- go up to ESPN, which is in Bristol, Connecticut, where they have all the football games on a bunch of monitors on Sunday afternoon. And Chris Berman, the host of their pre- and post-game shows, and Tom Jackson, who 's a participant in the shows, and Phil Simms are all up there and a cast of about 30 people in total. And they 're all up there working the games. I mean, they 're preparing their highlights show, which starts at 7:00 each night. And this, for a football fan, is heaven, because every game is on. Some games are on two or three different monitors -- about eight different monitors. But I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here. Imagine if you will that there are two rows of monitors like this, four on each row. This is the top row, and there are four here. In the upper righthand corners, in the second half of the games -- and I 'm sitting -- it 's a huge conference room, and I 'm sitting in one of the corners of the conference room to stay out of the way. And the room is fairly quiet, which is unusual, because most of the time the room is -- it 's like a locker room. There 's all kinds of teasing and ribbing going on, and I took my fair share. And they have a practical joke they play on all guests. They tell you when you arrive that the guest has to go out between the first and second games to get snacks for everybody. So I was prepared to do it. I mean, ye -- because you ca n't watch football without snacks. I was prepared to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quiet moment, and on this upper righthand monitor -- every -- imagine seven other monitors here, folks, and they 've all got NFL football games. All of a sudden on this monitor, somebody decides to show Clinton arriving back at the White House getting off of Marine One. So imagine if you 're me -- I 'm sitting there and I 'm having a great time and I 'm watching all these games, and the Pittsburgh Steelers-Miami Dolphins is right there. And that 's the game I 'm watching. Right above it, here comes Clinton ge -- and I just blurted out, Oh, come on. Do we -- do we have to watch this bleep while we 're watching ' -- and the place erupted in laughter, ladies and gentlemen. It was a funny moment. I just want to thank the people at ESPN for extending the invitation, because it 's, as I say, football heaven. Now a lot of you have probably heard the media go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The voters were angry. They were cynical. They were fit to be tied, and that 's the only reason the Democrats have lost power in the House of Representatives. You angry people know who you are. ' Have you heard this? Frank Luntz is a pollster for the Republicans. He used to be a pollster for Perot. And he asked in a series of election polls, post-election polls, the question of voters : Are you angry or not? And look at this. Overall, 25 percent of the electorate said, Yeah, angry. ' Seventy-one percent said that they were not angry. And it -- you break it down between men and women and it 's -- it 's pretty close. So this should help dispel this notion of -- I think the liberal media will ignore it -- but there was n't a whole lot of anger. There was -- as I said, there was enlightenment. People had finally learned and had become informed enough to know what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House. And they were happy. I do n't know about you, but man, when I -- I did n't just trod to the polls. I ran in there. And I could -- I could n't wait to grab that lever, pf-shoo. I looked for every R I could and went, pf-shoo, pf-shoo, pf-shoo, pf-shoo. And I was happy about it. I was happy. And so were you. Well, were n't you? You were happy, too. I mean, it was a great day. And -- and I still ca n't get the smile off my face. And it 's still -- so I 'm w -- I 'm reading. I got up early on Sunday because it 's -- it 's a two- and a half-hour trip up to Bristol, Connecticut. So I wanted to get up and read the newspapers and have my usual cup of coffee before I left. And I 'm just minding my own business. I 'm going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their editorial section of the Sunday paper. And there 's this headline catches my eye, War Against Limbaugh. ' And it 's a Jack Anderson-Michael Binstein piece. And I said, Whoa. Who could be conducting war against me? ' So -- so I read the piece. We have -- we have taken just a few excerpts from this that I want to go through very quickly here. Listen to this. The White House is planning an unprecedented war of the airwaves against Rush Limbaugh. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is leading a group of Democrats who are calling for a communications counteroffensive. Officials think they have one trump card to play : grant interviews to radio show hosts who are friendly, or who at least give Clinton a fair shake. ' Well, they 've only been doing this all summer. Clinton 's been on all kinds of radio talk shows -- not mine, of course. But he 's been out -- he 's been out all over the place. And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another option under consideration is to recruit political figures who can be groomed into alternatives. ' Alternative hosts. Oh, can you just see it now? Sam Gejdenson, Richard Gephardt or Jim Sasser as the liberal counter to Rush Limbaugh. Why, that would be fun and entertaining to listen to, would n't it? Now read this. Some s -- sources say that Hollywood moguls Steven Spielberg and Norman Lear have been approached to help fund the fledgling effort for equal time. ' So they 're asking these guys to come up with the money to go -- there 's so much to say about this. The first thing is, they 've got to understand something very quickly at the White House. They lost. And the reason they lost -- I 'd love to take credit for this, folks. I really would. But it is n't me. I would love to tell you that what all this is is the result of a brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed strategy beginning in October or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans did n't handpick me, program me and send me out with marching orders and say, Go out there and create a bunch mind-numbed robots who agree with you and therefore us. ' Now these people think all they 've got to do is go out and find some liberal -- and there 's Cuomo waiting for something to do. They might call him. But they think -- they think all they got to do is go out and -- and -- and get this guy, put him on the air. They do n't -- the -- they 'll -- I 'd love them to find out just how easy it 's been to get on 665 radio stations and how easy it 's been to put together an audience that numbers 20 million per week. I 'd love them to try it. But, you know, two more things to consider. If this were a story that instead of saying War Against Limbaugh, ' said, War Against Rather, ' or, War Against Jennings, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Against Brokaw, ' and George Bush were the president, do n't you know what they 'd be talking about now. Enemy 's lists. And how dare the president try to impugn the media an -- and -- and influence them to do their jobs. But since it 's a Democratic White House, doing it against a radio talk show, most people -- I mean, I 'm sure they read it and went, My God, ' and they 're jealous -- they 're jealous that it 's me the White House is coming after and not them. But still they 're not talking about it. When you start talking about putting Steven Spielberg and Norman Lear together and their money to come up with somebody to counter me -- here 's why it wo n't work. They can try all they want, but the White House had better learn something fast. What defeated them is not me or conservative talk-show hosts or anything else. What defeated them is their ideas. And so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ideas they do, that echos them, that liberal 's going to be the world 's greatest kept secret. Nobody 's going to hear the guy or her. Nobody 's going to listen to them, because theses ideas have been totally rejected. But I welcome the battle. I welcome the war. Do we have time for this? Yeah, we do. What the heck. I want to show you something. This happened on " Regis and Kathie Lee " on Monday morning. Watch this. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " Live @!Mr-REGIS-PHILBIN-@ : Now do you have the answer for us -- the family name of " Married... With Children "? @!KELLY-@1Contestant : I do n't have a clue. I do n't know. @!Mr-PHILBIN : Gee, I ca n't -- I ca n't believe this. @!Ms-KATHIE-LEE-GIFF : See, family values are sweeping the nation. They 're not watching. @!Mr-PHILBIN : Kelly, we 're sorry. @!Ms-GIFFORD : They 're watching @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH, now Rege. Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that was, they were trying to give away one of their prizes to anybody on the phone who knew what the -- the -- the name -- the last name was of the " Married... With Children " family. And nobody knew it that called in. I do n't even know what it is. And -- and Kathie Lee said -- well, you heard her what -- you heard her say what she said, so it 's great. Thanks for being with us, folks. Great stuff coming up. How Clinton 's in trouble with the Democrats. Something I predicted was going to happen -- feeling OK over there? Good. And we 'll be back and show you that right after( coughs) this. Do n't go away. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : So great to have you with us. @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH and the excellence in broadcasting network -- on TV. Happy to be with you. L -- let me show you this headline from the New York Post on Friday, Dems Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says group. Now, folks, I 've been telling you -- I 've been telling you for the longest time, and I want to go through this one more time. Imagine yourself, you 're a Democrat and it 's Election night, 1992, you 've just got the White House to go along with everything and you 're looking -- you 're looking down the road saying, Man, oh, man, we own it all. We 've got every branch of government there is to have. We can enrich ourselves. We can empower ourselves. We can turn as much of this country into a socialist nation as we want because nobody can stop us now. ' Except the president did. In less than two years, this guy has taken the Democratic Party to its lowest level that it 's been since 1946, and -- and I -- I predicted that these people are -- the Democratic hierarchy is not going to sit well. Well, this headline that you saw is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a member of this. This is this group of people that formed basically to wrest control of the Democratic Party away from the liberal wing, the Tom Foleys and the Jim Wrights and the Mario Cuomos, the Ted Kennedys and so forth, who had run it, because they felt they were taking it south. And Clinton said, Yeah. I 'm a new Democrat, too. I 'll be a DLC guy. I 'll do it. ' And then what does he do? He turns this country into -- one-seventh of the economy over to health care. He ju -- he -- he -- he does n't look like anything resembling a new Democrat. So post-election analysis was offered by Al From. There he is. He 's the current DLC head. And we 're going to show you some clips. And this guy -- you women will probably think that he 's sad -- this is what some of the women in our production meeting thought. I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tied. I think he just ran up a flight of stairs, was late to the meetings and a little out of breath, but he 's also very angry. Here is Al From with his first of three clips on what happened to the Democrats and their big loss. @!Mr-AL-FROM-@1Presi :( From November 17, 1994) We lost largely because the voters were sending a message about politics as usual, about big government, about cultural liberalism, about the status quo in Washington, and they identified the Democratic Party with all of those things. The way out for the Democratic Party is to govern as new Democrats. @!LIMBAUGH : Ooh. The way out is to govern with new Democrats. ' But he was n't through, ladies and gentlemen. Here now, Al From and the Democratic Leadership Council 's message to President Clinton. Watch. @!Mr-FROM : I think, for President Clinton, there 's a pretty blunt message in this poll. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Ooh. @!Mr-FROM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Voiceover) Ooh. @!Mr-FROM :... or you 'll have to pay consequences. ' @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Hoo! @(Limbaugh-shown-in-) @!Mr-FROM : What this survey shows and the s -- and the focus groups that accompanied it, is that while voters are still willing to label him as a new Democrat... @!LIMBAUGH : Nah. @!Mr-FROM :... they believe he has governed as an old Democrat. @!LIMBAUGH : Heh-heh, that 's right. @!Mr-FROM : Fifty-four percent of the independents surveyed said they 're disappointed in President Clinton. @!LIMBAUGH : Right. @!Mr-FROM : And the reasons they gave were : One, that he supports big government programs like health care ; secondly, that he pursues a liberal agenda... @!LIMBAUGH : Oh. @!Mr-FROM :... and particularly a cultural liberal agenda as exemplified by gays in the military ; and third, that he always seems to be in trouble. @!LIMBAUGH : Whoa! Can you believe this? This is hot. Do you know what this shape up or pay the consequences ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means, Shape up or you 're not on the ticket, pal, in 1996. ' That 's what this means. There 's one more I want to show you here. And again, it 's more of a warning from Al From and the DLC to President Clinton. @!Mr-FROM : The bottom line for President Clinton and the Democrats in this study is this. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Eh, eh, eh, eh... @!Mr-FROM : We 're disappointed in what you 've done... @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Ooh-hoo-hoo. @!Mr-FROM :... but we have n't given up on you. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Aww. @!Mr-FROM : You have one last chance. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Yeah. @!Mr-FROM : You govern as a new Democrat -- unequivocally as a new Democrat, and you can win us back. And you can win back the vital center of the electorate. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Dream on, pal. @!Mr-FROM : And if you do n't, you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what does he do in response to this? He caves in and agrees with Republicans on school prayer. All right. Well, I 'll te -- oh, there 's one other thing, too. We could n't find this on tape, but we have it here. From also said, This election said the New Deal coalition is Humpty Dumpty and it ai n't going to get put back together again. ' Which is pretty much true. I predicted all of this would happen, and now it is. We 've got one more segment to go. We 'll get to it when we come back. Actually, two more -- short one. Back right after this. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : And here we are back at you. Let me show you something from the newspaper on Sunday, Prez Sez Time For Teamwork. ' Right before he was leaving Honolulu to come back to the United States, he said, that, it 's time for Democrats and Republicans to stop moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is it not? We went back into the archives of this very show, and we 've put together a little montage of President Clim -- Clinton setting this example of not blaming anybody and offering to work together and not moan about your opponents. You 'll remember all of this, I 'm sure. President BILL CLINTON : What do our adversaries do in this election? What do Governor Cuomo 's adversaries do? They do n't have other programs. They do n't have a vision for the future. They just say things are bad. One of the rules that sometimes the other side forgets to mention in their litany of values is : Though shalt not bear false witness. We say yes ; they say no. You hear conflict. Conflict and defeat is what you hear. You do n't know what has been done. And it 's hard to assess responsibility. Why then are we confronted in this administration with an opposition party that just stands up and says, No. No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. No. ' And they raise more money than we do to turn their opponent into aliens, right? We Democrats do n't have the kind of -- of machine, in a way -- media machine that Republicans do, so it 's spewing out all this venom and all this labeling and name calling all the time. You know, today we 're having the Easter egg roll on the White House lawn. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Watch this. @!Pres-CLINTON : Look out there at those kids. They are the hostages of the Senate filibuster. When our opponents have nothing else to offer, when they do n't have a health-care plan and they do n't have an economic plan and they do n't want to vote for any tough decisions to reduce the deficit and they are mad because the Democrats are now the engine of change on issues like welfare reform and crime... @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) You thought. @!Pres-CLINTON :... then they resort to the politics of division and distraction and destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see examples of the president offering to work together, practicing the teamwork that he so often espouses, and, of course, never blaming his opponents for any of the distractions or problems that he is facing. We have to go, ladies and gentlemen, not because we want to and not because we think you want us to, but because the constraints of time have trapped us. We 'll be back, though, with a final goodbye right after this. So do n't go away. @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : Well, I 'd tell you what 's going to be on our next show, but we probably wo n't get to it. So it 's a simple God-bye. See you later. Bye-bye.
