247841 SCOTT SIMON, Host : This is Weekend Edition. I 'm Scott Simon. A number of years ago, I was working out of the engineer 's lounge at a radio station in Chicago, WFMT, and it seemed not two weeks would go by that a man with a tossed salad of silver hair, scuffed shoes, a chewed off cigar stump and a dangling tie, did n't present himself in the doorway looking chagrined. Now, once he held out what looked like a litter of black spaghetti in his hands- recording tape that had rolled off a reel. Usually, he held a small tape recorder up in his hands, the way a child might hold out a toy truck with a busted wheel. ' Gee, Studs, ' the engineers would say, ' what the hell have you done now? ' STUDS TERKEL, Radio Host : Oh, mechanically, technically? SCOTT SIMON : Yeah. STUDS TERKEL : Well, I 've got to make it clear, that I 'm probably the most inept guy anywhere. SCOTT SIMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right. I was checking your shoelaces. STUDS TERKEL : Oh, my shoelaces. Do they make you nervous? SCOTT SIMON : No, no. I was wondering if you 'd tied them, frankly. STUDS TERKEL : Oh, well, they 're tied. Oh, I see. I 'm a little slow on the uptake. I do n't drive a car. SCOTT SIMON : Neither do I. STUDS TERKEL : Oh, you do n't? SCOTT SIMON : No. We 're the last two people, I think. STUDS TERKEL : But one- SCOTT SIMON : You got the license? STUDS TERKEL : No. SCOTT SIMON : I do n't either. STUDS TERKEL : But could that be? Because you 're of a younger generation? You do n't drive a car. SCOTT SIMON : I never learned. STUDS TERKEL : It 's astonishing. SCOTT SIMON : I think I 'd be terrible at it too. STUDS TERKEL : You 're an anomaly. I ca n't, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more. I 'm a little easier now, not better, but easier, with a tape recorder. Often I press the wrong button. SCOTT SIMON : Studs Terkel, who over 40 years of interviews that pierce the celebrated and celebrate the obscure, has managed to find the right button more than enough to compile, between his radio show and many books, an astonishing body of work that ranges from South Africa to Chicago 's South Side. A new collection of just a small selection of his interviews has been released, Four Decades With Studs Terkel, which features interviews with artists, activists and thinkers including James Baldwin, Tennessee Williams, Nadine Gordimer sp, Betty Carter, Mel Brooks and Bertrand Russell. STUDS TERKEL : I almost lost Bertrand Russell. Here I was, up in a town called Pendrun Dydraft sp, a name that is unspellable, a Welsh name in north Wales, in his little college during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Suddenly, I realize, I was just about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the button on, the on button. I 'm just about to start and ' Lord Russell, ' and he said, ' Oh, what is it, young man? ' I said, ' Just a moment. ' And then, I 'm pressing that button. clip from interview with Bertrand Russell STUDS TERKEL : Lord Russell, there are a great many young people who admire you very much. They march. They sit down. And I think of some early BBC talk that you gave that was heard over our station in Chicago, why you like Turgenev. And you said because he dealt with eager, young people, a society of eager, young people whom one could easily grow to love if one knew them. Would you say it 's their equivalents who are with you during these days? Sir BERTRAND RUSSELL : Well, there are a greater many young people who are with me. You see, I think it 's natural enough. People on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer people. Look at me, I 'm 90. Well, I have n't much expectation anyhow, to me personally, it does n't much matter whether there 's a nuclear war or not. In the course of nature, I should die about the time that it happens. And the young people do n't feel like that. They have their life ahead of them. They want to be allowed to live it. And they do n't want these evilly ruffians to come and say, ' No, we 'll wipe you out just to please us and so that we may win the next election. ' They do n't want that and I think that 's very natural in the young and very praiseworthy. STUDS TERKEL : I almost lost Russell. I lost Michael Redgrave by forgetting to press the button. But, it 's an asset at times. SCOTT SIMON : That 's what I 'm asking, yes. STUDS TERKEL : Now, here 's where it becomes an asset. SCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say, for the books, these are the not celebrated people, not authors or musicians. This is say, someone in a housing project, and I forgot to press the button. She 'd say, ' You did n't press that. ' And I say, ' Oh, thank you. ' At that moment, she feels not only my equal, my superior. See, at that moment, I 'm not this guy with a mike from Mt. Olympus coming down to earth to do it, but this goof ball with this machine. And she helps me. Some people accuse me of deliberately goofing it up so I can make that other person feel better. That 's not so. I 'm just inept. It 's simple as that. SCOTT SIMON : I 've spent at least two of Studs Terkel 's four decades behind a microphone trying to fathom what there is that makes this man, who sees himself so easily as a goof ball, and is so skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He interrupts. He laughs too loud. He finishes other people 's sentences. On the other hand, by giving so much to an interview, he elicits much back in return, such as this 1961 talk with Tennessee Williams. clip from interview with Tennessee Williams TENNESSEE WILLIAMS : I 've always regarded myself as an incomplete person and consequently, I have always been more interested in my own kind of people, you know, people that have problems, people that have to fight for their reason, people who come close to cracking and all that. Those are my- that 's my world. Those are my people. And I must write about the people I know. And perhaps that limits me. I 'm sure it must limit me as an artist. But nevertheless, I could n't create believable characters if I moved outside of that world. That does n't mean that I 'm altogether a crackpot, because I 'm not and I can- STUDS TERKEL : Pardon me, I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the fact that, are n't these people basically sensitive people, up against a brutal framework? TENNESSEE WILLIAMS : I think, of course, they are. Give a person an acute sensibility and you 're bound to find a person who is under a good deal of torment, especially in this particular time that we 're in. SCOTT SIMON : Studs Terkel always reads the books of any author he interviews, listens to the music of any composer, sees the plays of any playwright or actor. At the age of 82, he still has much homework. STUDS TERKEL : I only have on people, I 'd say, those whom I respect as either writers or musicians or whatever they may be. SCOTT SIMON : Um-hmm. STUDS TERKEL : Well, how can you show any respect unless you know his work or certainly, if you 've read his book? SCOTT SIMON : You know this. There all people, all the time, who 've been interviewing people for years, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who say they never read the book. STUDS TERKEL : Oh, Larry King. SCOTT SIMON : I said no names mentioned. STUDS TERKEL : No, he 's proud now laughter. SCOTT SIMON : I know, he 's proud of it. STUDS TERKEL : He 's proud of it. SCOTT SIMON : Yeah. STUDS TERKEL : And I get, I 've been on his program and I get a kick out of him. I do. And he 's fond of me, you know. SCOTT SIMON : Yeah. STUDS TERKEL : But, he 's proud of that. But at least in his case, he makes it quite clear. But there are many who pretend. That 's even worse, you see. SCOTT SIMON : Studs makes his point with a story about an old friend. STUDS TERKEL : Sir Nelson Algren, after he wrote The Man With The Golden Arm, was interviewed by someone in San Francisco, who obviously had n't the slightest idea who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ' The man with a golden- what 's it about? ' Nelson said ' It 's about the Golden Gate Bridge. ' And he said, ' It is? ' And for the next half-hour, Nelson Algren talked about the Golden Gate Bridge. SCOTT SIMON : Oh, no. STUDS TERKEL : The guy did n't know the difference. I know when I watch a TV show or hear radio and the person is interviewing and you know they have n't read the book, quite obviously. ' What 's it about? ' Right. ' What 's it about? ' ' Well, how did you come to write it? ' or ' How long have you been a writer? ' You know that they have n't read the book. SCOTT SIMON : Yes. Larry King says- STUDS TERKEL : But, the point, it 's even worse, is that the writer has to play the game along with them. SCOTT SIMON : Uh-huh. STUDS TERKEL : They both pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an author himself, ranging around the talk show circuit with Division Street America, Working, The Good War, which won the Pulitzer Prize, and his memoir, Talking to Myself. But it 's hard not to reel through this riches of talks without recalling that his virtuosity was established in hard times. Studs was hosting a successful television show in the early 1950 's, Studs ' Place on ABC, when he was black-listed, named by someone, it 's still not known who, as a former communist. The celebrities and stars who once clamored to join him on ABC would not return phone calls to the small FM station in Chicago where he came to work, WFMT. Studs found a new career by seeking out people network television then avoided. music When he spoke with Mahalia Jackson is 1963, it was less about gospel music than the solace of gospel and her own tough life, coming north to Chicago from New Orleans. clip from interview with Mahalia Jackson MAHALIA JACKSON : When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people, they just hug me and love me, and say I 'm so wonderful and I 'm so great. And then, when I 'm walking down the street like an ordinary citizen, they do n't recognize me. And when I go into a department store in the South, they- I ca n't get a sandwich. I ca n't get a bottle of pop. I 've got to stand. I ca n't even get a cab. And I 'm just the Mahalia Jackson that they got through saying how wonderful I am. I do n't understand this. What makes people act like that? STUDS TERKEL : Well, this is the big question, Mahalia, this split in people. MAHALIA JACKSON : It 's awful. It just hurts me. And I 'm so hurt about it. It keeps me praying, you know, for the Lord not to let hate get in my heart, as Doctor Martin Luther King says ' Walk together children. Do n't you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised land. ' And this promised land is right here in America. SCOTT SIMON : We hear a lot in our age that the general level of literacy is declining, that people don't- have noticed, as you interview people, that the general level of conversation has declined? STUDS TERKEL : What 's happened here, oh boy, so many things. It 's easy to say it has. I know it has. But why? I think one reason is technology itself. The very nature of technology. SCOTT SIMON : Um-hmm. STUDS TERKEL : As we become more and more enamored, technology we know can help mankind. It has, of course, in labor-saving devices, washing machines, other matters. At the same time, the love of it has overwhelmed us. A case in point. I like cases in point. You 've been in the Atlanta airport? SCOTT SIMON : Yes. STUDS TERKEL : It 's a modern airport. SCOTT SIMON : Yeah. STUDS TERKEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concourses. SCOTT SIMON : The subway you have to take to get to your plane? Yeah. STUDS TERKEL : Yeah, subways. And they 're nice and smooth and silent, silent. I 'm on it and it 's crowded and a young couple are late and they rush in and part the pneumatic doors, just about to close. And as they close, the same voice, oh, it 's a mechanical voice. It 's a man 's voice. You know that. It is a human. But, it 's mechanical. It 's imitating the machine. So, as the doors shut and the couple just make it, the same voice, without pause says, ' Because of late entry, we 're delayed 30 seconds. ' Everybody 's looking at that couple, you know, and they 're just quailing and they 're embarrassed. And I had a few drinks. And so I 'm saying, ' George Orwell, your time has come and gone. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a baby sitting on the lap and so I look at the baby, about a year old and I said, ' What is your opinion of all this? ' SCOTT SIMON : laughter STUDS TERKEL : And the baby just breaks into one of those big, wide, FDR-type grins. And so I holler, ' There 's still hope in the world. ' SCOTT SIMON : Although the ways in which information and reflection has become shortened, tightened and burnished into megabytes and sound bites, reminds Studs Terkel of an old vaudeville routine. STUDS TERKEL : So this one guy, saying to the other guy, ' Vhat is your philosophy of life? You 've got 10 seconds. ' And the guy comes up with a gamy comment involving sex, he goes, ' Get it all while you can. ' And the audience howls. Now maybe, the guy on TV, the anchorman says, ' You 've got 15 seconds. ' Nobody 's laughing. That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCOTT SIMON : Three of the interviews featured in Four Decades With Studs Terkel are with comedians or comic actors - Woody Allen, Zero Mostel and Mel Brooks. But as the Shakespearian actor once said, ' Dying is easy. Comedy is hard. ' STUDS TERKEL : Comics, they have schtick. Plural of schtick is what, schticker, schtickes, that 's it. And so they have that and that 's their glass encasement. That 's their covering. But coming to that, I like to also be a stooge for comics, nothing I like better than being a stooge. SCOTT SIMON : Yeah. STUDS TERKEL : Say for Zero Mostel. So when he was on the program, I says, ' You are a great tenor, Senor Mostelli. ' And he said, ' Si. ' And, of course he 's, and, ' Sir, you are the greatest since Caruso. ' ' That 's true, ' he says. ' So, tell me, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all know the old story, tenors are all jealous of one another, very much. SCOTT SIMON : They 're like comics. STUDS TERKEL : Like comics. And so, I asked, ' Senor Mostelli, may I ask your opinion of some of your colleagues? ' clip from interview with Zero Mostel ZERO MOSTEL : Please, aska me ten? STUDS TERKEL : Well, what do you think, Senor Romanelli, what do you think of Jan Pierce? ZERO MOSTEL : He 's a pig. La potte dolce sp. STUDS TERKEL : What do you think of Richard Tucker? ZERO MOSTEL : He 's a pig. STUDS TERKEL : What do you think of DiStephano? ZERO MOSTEL : He 's the biggest pig of them all. STUDS TERKEL : What do you think of Tito Gobi? ZERO MOSTEL : Baritone. laughter SCOTT SIMON : One thing I noticed, by contrast, your interview with Woody Allen. Now, that was, I guess, back stage, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TERKEL : Mr. Kelly 's that 's right. SCOTT SIMON : He 's very serious. STUDS TERKEL : Yeah. SCOTT SIMON : Very serious, very serious. And you treat him seriously, of course. You did n't play a role with him, you did n't try to get him to be a comic for you. STUDS TERKEL : Oh, no. It was different. You see, in the case of Mostel and Brooks, they were of another school. He was different. clip from interview with Woody Allen WOODY ALLEN : The truth of the matter is, I 'm not kidding, exactly, when I 'm on stage. I do feel, I do have a series of trials and tribulations every day and it 's always a big hassle for me. And I 've never had an easy time coping with people or events or mechanical objects, or you know. And so, I joke about it. It so happens, what it boils down to is I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can describe them funny. But, you know, that 's it. STUDS TERKEL : There 's always one fall guy and that 's you, the fall guy. I mean, the patsy is you. But as the pasty tells a story about himself. WOODY ALLEN : That happens to be an expression of my personality. You do n't find that in- SCOTT SIMON : It 's often noted that Studs Terkel is a lawyer by training, although he 's never practiced. Therefore, feature writers have sometimes ventured the idea that his virtuosity as an interviewer was developed by the study of law. Studs believes the opposite, that while lawyers are trained to ask only questions to which they know the answers, great interviews only begin when someone says something they have never heard themselves say before. STUDS TERKEL : If I had questions to which I knew the answer, why would I ask the question? Of course, have I been astonished? Well, of course, astonishment is what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Wonder is what knowledge is all about. SCOTT SIMON : This collection of Studs Terkel 's work necessarily features names that are recognizable, but not necessarily celebrities, at a time when there seems to be a saturation of celebrities in American life. There 's Leonard Bernstein and Dorothy Parker, but not Shannon Doherty and John Wayne Bobbitt. STUDS TERKEL : Gee, now who 's a celebrity? Let 's take two celebrities. Albert Einstein, right? He was celebrated. Of course. So 's Zsa Zsa Gabor. They 're both celebrities, right? Who gets more ink today? The point is it 's value-free. The word celebrity is all-encompassing, known for being known. SCOTT SIMON : I 've concluded over the years, there 's little to be learned about interviewing from Studs Terkel. To do that, you 'd need his eye, his audacity, even maybe his eccentricities, which are his alone. I 've interviewed a number of people over the years, who 've also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 've asked a few of them? I remember a union leader who once said, ' Well, it 's better than psychoanalysis because it 's cheaper. But it 's worse because everybody hears you with your guts hanging out. ' Making space to sit amid the sheaves of transcripts and tape reels at his office at WFMT, Studs Terkel leans over a bit to aim his hearing aids at a question or an answer. Maybe he talks too much. But he listens even more intently. He interrupts and interjects and sometimes overwhelms an answer with his laughter. But after 40 years on the business end of a microphone, that is if Studs remembers to hold the right end of the microphone, Studs Terkel 's enthusiasms and eccentricities betray the fact that there 's someone else ahead that he wants to hear from. STUDS TERKEL : Interview someone who has never been interviewed before, who is a face, seemingly a face in the crowd. That 's something else. Then, some of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives, they 're talking about something they have n't talked about before. So it 's frontier country and I like frontier country. SCOTT SIMON : Studs Terkel. A new audio cassette collection of some of his interviews, Four Decades With Studs Terkel has been released by the High Bridge Company..
