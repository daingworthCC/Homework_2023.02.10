248641 @!SCOTT-SIMON-HOST : Moorcheeba has been called a " trip hop band, " a " hippy groove band, " and a " deep-dish dub-and-rap group, " but even those terms, whatever they mean, might not capture the mix and mischief in their music. Moorcheeba is a band of brothers, Ross and Paul Godfrey( ph) and vocalist Sky Edwards( ph). Their first album was, " Who Can You Trust? ", which combined elements of British mod music of the ' 60s with Chicago blues hip-hop and L.A. rap Caribbean dub, who knows what else? You might need a mining engineer to uncover all the veins of influence. Moorcheeba has now produced a second album, " The Big Calm( ph), " which should set critics to their thesauruses -- or is it " thesauri " once again? -- trying to describe music that can be at once sedate and searing, tranquil and tempestuous, ethereal, edgy.( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA, " FRICTION ") SKY EDWARDS, VOCALIST, SINGING : Nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is the day Something is stirring way underneath Because people in night go at last burning rings Friction is turning to fight, friction... SIMON : That 's from their song " Friction. " We spoke to Moorcheeba from the studios of WBUR in Boston. How would you describe what you do, if you could? PAUL GODFREY, MOORCHEEBA : It 's a kind of mixture of blues, rock, rap, funk, reggae, jazz, soul, hip-hop @!SIMON Hmm! Well, I mean, everything( unintelligible) EDWARDS : And there 's country thrown in there too. P. GODFREY : Disco, country.( LAUGHTER) SIMON : Well, how do all those influences get there. Tell us something... P. GODFREY : For me personally, it was just being brought up badly.( LAUGHTER) Brought up badly with a good record collection @!SIMON Sky? EDWARDS : Ummh, the radio was always on, and my mum used to play a lot of Slim Whitman. Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, honey, honey, kiss me, thrill me, honey, honey "? Do you know that one? " Come kiss me... "( unintelligible) SIMON : No, I guess I 'm too young( unintelligible) P. GODFREY : That was an Edwardian.( LAUGHTER) EDWARDS : Just quite a lot of that, that pop -- they had rock, they have everything, really @!SIMON How did the three of you come together? P. GODFREY : Sky came around to our flat one day, and sang to us with her acoustic guitar. She was trying to throw us a drum kick @!EDWARDS Yes, I used to play drums when I was in school. P. GODFREY : We ended up hearing Sky sing, and she just had this lovely voice, and Ross and I had been demoing the record companies for ages without a singer @!SIMON Yes. P. GODFREY : And we thought, if we had the right singer, then we 'd probably get a deal built around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. GODFREY : That 's what happened. And then we recorded our first record. Half of it was done in a bedroom, and then the second half was finished in our studio. And then we went on the road. And when we got off the road, we recorded " Big Calm " in three months and went back on the road, and here we are @!SIMON My gosh! It was that quick? P. GODFREY : Yes @!EDWARDS Yes. ROSS GODFREY, MOORCHEEBA : It seems much quicker when he says it that quick.( LAUGHTER) SIMON : How did you begin to write together, if that 's what you do? EDWARDS : I remember like initially I was -- because " Trigger Hippy "( ph) was our first demo together, that we had this small little computer screen, and then this kind of idea that was going on, and I just remember singing " Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. " And then I came back a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in, drop out, " and that was " Trigger Hippy. "( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA, " TRIGGER HIPPY ") SIMON : How much technical rigmarole, if I might put it this way, is in your music? How much of it 's synthesized? How much is computer-generated? How much is sampled? P. GODFREY : The only thing that 's really synthesized is come upon by complete accident, and then sampled and used.( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA) SIMON : Could you explain to me that -- how you did what I guess the technical term is the " reverse solo " in " Big Calm "? P. GODFREY : There 's about seven different soundtracks from " The Big Calm. " One of them is a backward slide-guitar. We turned the tape upside-down on the 24-track machine, recorded a guitar with a wah-wah( ph) unit playing side, with loads of echo on it. Then, when we turned the tape back round, the echo comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so, once we 'd played it with a beat, it was completely out of time that you know, this psychedelic...( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA) And it ended up sounding a little bit like a clarinet or something, which( unintelligible) R. GODFREY : Yes. But it was very much inspired by Jimi Hendrix, his method of recording in like 1966, with our experience...( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA) SIMON : Are you working on something now? P. GODFREY : Yes, we 've just been writing on the road, we 've just written a couple of like ten new songs, and we 've got that spectacular track for a movie called " Mod Squad. " And then we go through Europe to do another seven-week tour @!SIMON You 'll be doing the theme for the " Mod Squad " movie. P. GODFREY : I 'm not sure of the theme, but we 're going to do a song, and hopefully it 'll be better than all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have in the film, right? P. GODFREY : Yes @!SIMON Well, that sort of suggests 60s cop-show, British spy- show sensibility in some of your music, does n't it? P. GODFREY : Is that what the " Mod Squad " was? I mean, I do n't know anything about " Mod Squad. " Somebody said( unintelligible) SIMON : Oh, it was Peggy Lip -- Peggy Lipton -- let me see, maybe someone else in the control room can help me out. No? Everyone in the control room is younger than I am.( LAUGHTER) P. GODFREY : They 're all pleading ignorance @!SIMON They 're pretending to, are n't they? Yes. It was a cop-show, and it was -- what is it they said? A white, a black, and a blonde. Peggy Lipton was the blonde.( LAUGHTER) Who later married Quincy Jones, right? R. GODFREY : Right @!SIMON People are shaking their heads, as if, once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. GODFREY : Yes @!SIMON In any event, it was a -- it was an L.A. cop-show during the ' 60s,... R. GODFREY : Right @!SIMON... and no doubt not doing it justice, but yes, it was -- it was of that time and place. P. GODFREY : Oh! EDWARDS : Cool! SIMON : You sound thoroughly unmoved.( LAUGHTER) EDWARDS :( Unintelligible) P. GODFREY : I ca n't -- I ca n't get over the catch-phrase, " a white, a black, and a blonde. "( LAUGHTER) Ca n't be -- ca n't believe they used to get away with that sort of stuff.( LAUGHTER) SIMON : Well, it was -- the country was different then, you understand. P. GODFREY : We 're big fans of people like Lalo Schiffren( ph), though, and John Barry( ph), obviously, and... SIMON : Really? Now, they were the great 60 's movies swelling and lush themes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes. Yes, if we could only afford orchestras that big, it would be great @!EDWARDS Hmmm! P. GODFREY : We 've always got lots of things to do. It 's just finding the time to do it.( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA, " THE SEA ") EDWARDS, SINGING : Looking to the sea Crowds of people wait for me Seagulls scavenge still ice cream The words vanish within my dream. With myself I stand by the sea Lost control, living free, living... SIMON : " The Sea " has been compared to Gershwin. P. GODFREY : Really? SIMON : Yes @!EDWARDS Wow! That 's great! P. GODFREY : Oh! EDWARDS : Talking of Gershwin, we recorded a Gershwin song, recorded " Summertime "... SIMON : Yes @!EDWARDS... for " Red Hot Rhapsody " not so long ago @!SIMON Right. What was that like? Did you approach that with any particular feeling? P. GODFREY : We were going to make it sound kind of hip-hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it more tranquil. We did it in six- eight like the original, and we had pedal steel guitars on it and synthesizers... SIMON : Yes. P. GODFREY : And Sky sings in her typical languid tone.( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, MOORCHEEBA, " SUMMERTIME ")) EDWARDS, SINGING : Summertime and the livin ' is easy Fish are jumping, and the cotton is high Your momma 's rich, and your daddy... SIMON : The British band Moorcheeba singing " Summertime, " on the " Red Hot and Rhapsody " album. Their latest CD is called " Big Calm. " Moorcheeba joined us from WBUR in Boston.
