4173041 @!DONALD-TRUMP-JR. # Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they 'll say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie. You know, he wo n't say, well, I say this, we hear experts, you know, his housecat at home once said that this is what 's happening with the Russians. It 's disgusting. It 's so phony. @!DONALD-TRUMP-JR. # I mean, to me, it 's without a question, you know, reads and smells like a witch hunt. Right. Lock him up. So... Lock him up. Lock him up. So, some folks are kind of saying, you know, listen, he did n't commit a crime. You know, but, well, he 's not the president of the United States, but certainly, if they asked him this question, did you all have any conversations with Russia, and this gentleman said, no, it 's a lie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feds could get him on that. Lying, lying, lying. Well, the important distinction that I kind of wrestled with yesterday was when we first found out that he met with someone, and they did n't quite know who the person was going to be, it was a Russian lawyer that had Kremlin ties, but we do n't know if they were there, you know, on behalf of the government. Right. So that was an important distinction for me. This email saying he not only knew that this was, they were carrying information from the Russian government, that was a game-changer for me. So when this broke last night, I was, like, okay, there was a little gray area, now it 's not so gray anymore. Well, it 's always the lie that gets people in trouble, right. That was sort of Nixon 's downfall. It 's always the coverup, and I just remember when I was interviewing witnesses, I would say, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's perjury, five years in jail. Do n't lie to me. But it has to be under oath. Does n't it have to be under oath? Yeah, yeah, but I would say that, and, and I 've got to tell you... Start( inaudible). People are saying, well, this is n't a crime. it could be. It could be sort of a violation of federal campaign laws. But even if it is n't, what federal prosecutors are looking at and these investigators, they 're looking at little pieces of the puzzle. There 's never the smoking gun that everybody talks about. It 's always those little layers. Well, the email is a smoking gun, is n't it? Kind of. It depends what it says. But Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. Listen, people, there 's a lot of... Russia, Russia, Russia. There 's a lot of Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw the boy under the bus because the first thing they said was, my father was n't there, he did n't have anything to do with this. He 's capable of turning on his own child, I have a feeling, not Ivanka. I do n't think so. loyalty means... Yeah, but what if, what if this, what if Donald Trump Sr was the one who told him to take this meeting, though? I have a really hard time believing that this meeting happened, and Donald Trump, President Trump, did n't know about it. Did n't know about it. And nobody knew. Of course he knows everything they do. What 's interesting, though, is the Russian lawyer has come out and said she 's not affiliated with the Kremlin, she 's never worked with the Russian government and that she never had damaging information on Hillary. Sure. She never had the information. But there 's more to that statement. Do you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement. I 'm just giving a summary. I do n't have a statement. Oh, okay, all right. But, but the truth is that if he, if Donald Trump Jr thought that she was, at the time, affiliated with the Kremlin and that a Russian source had this information, this opposition research, you have to wonder. That 's solicitation. The question for me is why you would go, and you would, A, trust those sources, and, B, collude with the Russians to potentially, you know, make our election process compromised. Let me read her thing, though, because it 's important to hear. In an NBC News interview this morning, the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, said Donald Trump Jr asked her whether she had any financial records that might prove the funds used to sponsor the DNC were coming from inappropriate sources. That 's what she 's saying, that 's what she 's saying that he asked her. Yeah, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ask is very important under the law, but the other thing she talked about during that interview, if I recall, was that she talked about Russian adoption. And that had to do with the sanctions. If you 're talking about sanctions, that is also a problem. So, again, investigators are sort of looking at these little pieces of the puzzle. Listen, where there 's smoke, there 's fire, and there seems to be a lot of smoke. The issue of collusion, though, just to point out, the issue of collusion, Sarah Huckabee Sanders did make one good point, I thought. She pointed out, this is not related to Donald Trump, that the DNC had coordinated opposition research directly with the Ukrainian embassy in the past. And I remember there was a Politico story in January, it talked about how Ukrainian government officials had helped Clinton 's allies get damaging information on Trump... What does that have to do with this? No, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with is if you hear about collusion... Hold on, wait, stop. Stop... You have to go across the board. Hillary Clinton is not the president. Stop, we 're going. Later, one bad mother? A mom 's viral rant about why she curses in front of her kids. Are the ladies speaking her language? Welcome back. Some very odd stuff has just happened over the commercial break. Fredo, Donald Trump Jr, just tweeted about the email exchange that he supposedly had about the meeting with the Russian attorney. We 're trying to figure out why he would do that because what 's in here seems very, very clear. Incriminating. And very incriminating. So we 're kind of thinking this might have been put out so they can say, see, gotcha. Who is going to say that? Who is going say that? I mean... Them. If it 's not, just hear me out. You mean if it 's fake? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying. So, I 'm saying to y'all, we 're not sure. We 're not. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He tweeted this, Donald Trump Jr. But this is what, this is what we 're being told, that Donald Trump Jr tweeted this. And there it is. Now, you circle, so it 's too small for me to read any way. So it 's... And I, and I agree, Whoopi, because Rachel Maddow actually just, just reported said people were sending her things that were likely not correct to sort of have a gotcha moment with the media. So assuming that, you know, that could be true, but... So keep that in mind. Keep that in mind. We 're telling you it may be BS. This may be a hoax. And we would correct it if it were. But this may be a hoax. But what it does say is, this email went to Donald Trump Jr, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aris, this morning, and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary in her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information, but as part of Russian and its government 's support for Mr. Trump, I can also send this info to your father, via( inaudible), but it is ultra-sensitive so wanted to send to you first. " And that was in June, last June. So that, that little tidbit... That 's quite a smoking gun. Where you say part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump, that 's a problem because now you have an acknowledgment by Rob Goldstone that, if this is true, that this is affiliated with Russia, A, it 's an effort by Russia and its government to undermine Hillary Clinton and impact our election, and then, if he read this, if Trump Jr read this, and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look good. It 's a violation of campaign laws. That 's a problem. You know why it 's suspicious? You know why it 's suspicious? Because even the Junior is not that stupid that he would put this out. It 's very strange. Yeah, I do n't... That 's what strains credulity. I find this, I find it really, really hard to believe. That 's why... That 's why I 'm ' saying, he actually put this out? That sounds... I find that hard to believe. It 's like they handcuffed themselves. Maybe he 's really that dumb. Although, look, the Twitter, the Twitter account, Donald, allegedly Donald Trump Jr tweeted to everyone, " In order to be totally transparent, I 'm releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting in 2016. " So it... How do they confirm that this is real? How do they do that? I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's coming, it 's coming from his account, I was told. It is coming from... Well, it may be coming from his account. That does n't mean that it 's real. That does n't mean that it 's real. They might have hacked into his account. No I do n't think they hacked in, but, you know, as I told you the other day, the governor from Maine. Yeah, oh yeah. Talked about how he liked to put... Plant things... Plant stuff out there that was crap just to see people flip out about it. What a scary time. Well, it is scary times, but if, if, in fact, this is BS, and you put it out to get attention, so you got our attention now. And you know who else is paying attention now to you? The people you were trying to placate. You 're trying to placate the government guys, now they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what. Yeah, investigators do n't like this. They do n't like because if this is, if you sent this out to set them up. Yeah. that might have been a large mistake on your part, Fredo. But hey, do n't listen to me. Watch the movie. Okay. By the way, can I, I want to say one small thing, one small thing about what I was talking about, the couch before. Remember that? My friend, Jill, back to... Back to something really important, sorry. Back to fake, fake, lying, lying and fake news. My friend Jill just tweeted me, and she said she was, she said that she paid $15,000 for that couch in London. That 's ridiculous. Not $5,000. So everybody is making up stories. $15,000? Fifteen. We 're sticking with her( inaudible). I mean, if it 's true... We 'll, we 'll, this is, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. But I, we do n't ever want to bring you, if it smells funny to us, we 're going to say it smells a little weird. We 'll let you know. We 'll tell you what 's going on, but it smelled a wee bit strange. But either it 's true, but either it 's true, and he does n't realize that this is, it 's like, incriminating things. He has an attorney now. He has an attorney. What attorney would allow their client to do this? Or, or he 's making light of it and making a mockery of something that people are concerned about. So either way, this is not a good look. Right, that 's, that 's why, it 's not going to work. Either he 's an idiot, or he thinks Mueller is an idiot. Somebody, in other words, they 're going to use this against this guy. But he has an attorney. He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel would allow him to tweet this out. As you know... It makes no sense. Because you, yes, you all ca n't act like this is a surprise to you, this family does n't care what their attorney says. That 's true. That 's true. There 's, it 's, it does n't, you know, so keep in mind that he said, yeah, nothing 's going the happen to me. Hubris is an amazing thing. When you think you 're above it all, the crash is tough. Now, you know, again, if it 's true, I 'm sure they, this is not going to stop. If it 's not true, we got you first, we 're hip to you. We 'll be right back. You know, it kind of, folks are saying most Republicans think that there 's something else negative having an impact on America, and it 's college. Now, a Pew Research Center poll found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative impact on the country. So is that the problem we need to be dealing with is that college is the issue? Or is the question, should everybody go to college? Does everybody need to go to college? I mean, that 's... I 'm really disturbed by the notion that a majority, that these Republicans think that college is n't important. I mean, especially as a person of color, I mean, education is the great equalizer, right? We were n't allowed to be educated, and that 's why you had the rise of HBCUs. And, you know, if you, if you look, if you look at the stats, people that have a college degree earn more money, they make more money. They have a better living. Sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes. And, you know, there are people that have n't gone to college, they 're the, their success may be the exception. I mean, the general rule... No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need people to, you need plumbers. But you 're, you 're an EGOT. You 're an exception. No, no, I 'm not talking about me. But I 'm not an exception. I 'm somebody who could n't do college. I could n't go to college because of the way my brain works. So I had to find a different way. Yes, I get that. But not everybody is meant to go to college. I do n't think it 's for everyone. And for me, you know, I say this all the time. But, in the state of New Jersey, there are maybe 25 plumbers. That 's all? That 's it. It 's not a lot of plumbers in New Jersey because there are no schools, no trade schools. We need those. Trade schools are important. Vocational training is something that... Well, you need vocational training, but not everybody is meant to be in that structure. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to, I do, I liked school. You like, you love to learn, yes, you know. But I, and I agree. vocational schools are very important. training is very important. following your passion is very important. We talked about our hairdresser, hair stylist Derek Monroe,( PH) who, you know, is fantastic at what he does. But that if you look at the stats as a whole... If you can go, you should go. If you can go, you should go. Wait, there are a lot of people choose different routes, though. There are people that go into the military, and bonus for them. Then if they decide to go to school, they might get their education paid for. There 's vocational training, there 's also AmeriCorps and Peace Corps, people that spend a year maybe giving back, a time of duty. just structured, four-year, you know, liberal arts, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for everyone. Do you remember when Trump was running, he said I love the educated, I love the poorly educated. The Republican Party may like the poorly educated because they vote for them. Oh, that 's not fair. That 's not fair. Well, that, why was he saying that? There 's a lot of very well-educated, very successful people out there voting for Republicans, I promise you that. Why?.. Why? Why would they, tell me why... Why? Tell me why Why would they vote for Republicans? Yeah, well, no, why, why would, hold on a second. Why would somebody vote for Trump besides people who do n't really understand... a lot of people voted for Trump because they thought he was going to advocate for lower taxes for them. And that 's all they care about. Well, listen, if you ca n't put food on the table to feed your family... That 's something else. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of your income, 40 percent of your income leave... I 'm not talking about, I 'm talking about rich people, rich people who voted for him. Why? Why? Rich people, maybe rich people, rich people do n't pay their health care costs for them and their family. Define rich for me. Half the, those rich people that are labeled rich oftentimes are giving half of their money, 50 percent of their money... Oh, my heart breaks. Were n't we talking about college? We were talking about college. No, no, no, no. Talking about college? But again, what the issue is, Republicans are saying that college is bad. And we should be very... Well, first of all, we do n't know these people are that are polled. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans now say &nbsp; that colleges are having a negative effect on the way things are going in the country. But you do n't know why. I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bias on many college campuses, on the majority of college campuses. I 've seen it. I 've lectured at a bunch of college campuses. I 've taught on college campuses. So have I, actually. I 've done a lot of lecturing, and... that 's what they 're referencing, that there is a bias that students come out with, A, and then, B, maybe they were also saying... And then they read. No, they read, you do n't believe that there 's a bias in the majority, there 's not a liberal bias in the majority of colleges? This is what 's crazy to me. We all went to college here, okay. Not me. All right, she did n't. All right. And she 's the most successful one, arguably. Whoopi Goldberg... Yeah, but you 're well-studied, though. You 're well-studied. Whoopi Goldberg is what they call an autodidact. She is a self-learner. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college. In college, they opened my eyes. I read philosophy, I read sociology, I read it, and then.. You saw black people. Yes, I did. No, I saw them in... She 's from Brooklyn, it was n't the first time. Please, and I went to the same high school you did. Yes. So I saw plenty of black people. But that is crazy. This is like, I see dead people, I see black people. I 'm making a GIF of that. But, but for the majority of folks who go to college, it does open their eyes. You 're suddenly surrounded by lots of different people. That 's what, that was what I was trying to say. And educated people will vote in their own interests. A lot of times, people do not vote in their own interests because they do n't have the tools to understand this con man and what he 's told them. Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You( inaudible), no, I 'm sorry. You 're not giving people enough credit. I do n't think that gives people nearly enough credit. If you ca n't pay for your health insurance, if you ca n't put food on you table for the family, I do n't care what your level of education is... You make more money when you go to college. You 're smart enough to know that you want to vote someone into... You can. You know what? Both of you just hold on. Just hold on one second. I got a card. You got a card, and I got a life. Here 's what I 'm going to tell you. I know lots of different people who did n't go to college. Yeah, I do. Yes. Who were successful, who found their way in life. It 's not for everybody. Mark Zuckerberg, it worked out for him. It 's not for everybody. It is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should go. It does n't necessarily mean you 're going to make more money or less because I know a lot of people that went to college, ca n't make jack. That 's true. Okay? So we have to, we always have to tell people to take these kinds of things with a grain of salt and see what works for you. If it works for you, then have a great time. If it does n't, do n't be afraid of it. And do n't be afraid to look at a different kind of thing because quite honestly, I used to be able to fix my Volkswagen, I understood my car, okay, I was n't worried. If it went chug-a-lug, I knew what it meant, pour some stuff in it. Now if the thing goes chug-a-lug, I 'm scared because I know it 's going to be $1,000. At least. At least, just to take it in. Can we have some people who can fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that? You know, anyway, we 're having a good time. We know you 're having a good time. Y'all are having a good time. We 'll be right back. So, welcome back. Mom blogger Constance Hall is going viral right now for a post where she admits she curses in front of her kids who are eight and under. Oh, come to my house. She said she 'd rather they swear than be mean to other kids. What do you think of that? Well, she also clarified she does n't direct the swearing at people. At the children, right. It 's more when something shocking happens, she 's just, like, holy, you know, like, let 's move on. So it 's not directed at people. That 's an important distinction. I grew up in a house where my mom cursed. It was n't, my grandparents. I had like a crazy Italian family. They were always cursing around, not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playful, that was part of their vocabulary. And for years, I did n't curse at all. I did n't pick up on it. I grew up understanding that it was n't something that was used to express hate towards someone or to be vulgar but that it was just, it was just words. And sometimes that was the word that fit the moment best, and that 's the word my mom used. You think you 'll curse in front of your children, though? I 'll probably find myself cursing if that 's the word that the... Yeah, you will. She will. Yeah, that 'll just happen, and they 'll survive. She wo n't. But she will. I will. I will say, my grandmother used to curse in Spanish, man, and she would say and( speaking foreign language), and it was, like, I was horrified all the time. So I do n't, I do n't curse in front of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words. You did. And he repeated it at school. And he went to school. And then the teacher said, you know, you have to tell him not to do that. And she said, his Nana taught him. I said, are you sure he did n't learn that on " Sesame Street "? Because it 's, I have a tendency to laugh. When a kid says a funny, a word, like a three-year-old, it 's hilarious, What curse words did you teach him? Well, I did n't, he had heard me say, you know, you know what my favorite word is. It 's very different. I consciously taught all my grandkids. You did? Yes I did, yes I did. Why did you do that? There are certain words that are not bad. There are certain words that I do n't allow kids to say around me, like stupid. Like stupid, right. You know that because no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still gets you. Painful. But, and you ca n't say it with a smile. All the words I taught them can be said with a smile. You can say stupid with a smile. No, you ca n't say it, stupid, no, your face... You can say that, that is so stupid. But that 's a smirk. That 's not a smile. That 's a smirk. It 's sarcastic, which laced with anger. It 's kind of, you have to try. You do. You do n't have to try with the words I taught. Sunny is blushing( inaudible). How are you? See, that 's just the way, so put it in your head. You know what I 'm talking about. You have to tell them do n't use it in school because when they use it at school, they get into trouble. You have to tell them that Nana is going to get in trouble if you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant. My grandson used it in a restaurant. And his mother was so mad. She screamed at me. The H-word? Oh, no. Oh, a bigger word? Or girl, please. Go big or go home. You know, go through the alphabet and figure out which one you think I taught her. But, you know, Jay-Z. Oh, Jay-Z. We love Jay-Z. The new album dropped yesterday, and he shot a video to go with the release of the new record, " 4:44, " where he opened up about his problems in his marriage to Bey. Take a look. @!JAY-Z# I just ran into this place, and we built this big beautiful mansion of, of a relationship, you know what I mean, that was n't totally built on 100 percent truth. And then it started cracking, you know, and then things started happening that the public can see. You know what I 'm saying? And then we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay, tear this down. And let 's start from the beginning. Wow. I was, I was really impressed with that. I like his new album. What was interesting for me is he says in the title track, " Look, I apologized, often womanized, took for my child to be born to see through a woman 's eyes. " And, and I find, we 've had that discussion that sometimes when men have little girls, they realize, oh my goodness, what I 'm doing as man is harming this woman that I love so much, I need to do things differently. And he also wrote, " Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles. Took me too long for this song. I do n't deserve you. " So I just thought it was almost like a... I 'm not so sure about coming clean, though, all the time. You know, people are married, you know, you 're married for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair, and you moved on. You know, and it 'll pass like a kidney stone. It 'll pass. Leave it alone. You do n't have to bring it up. You know, what are you doing when you bring that up? What were you... The house was built on a cracked foundation. You ca n't build a house on a cracked foundation. You need truth. But you 're purging, you 're purging yourself, purging the guilt, and then you 're giving this person something to use against you. from the sounds of this and her " Lemonade " that there were too... She knew. Yeah, it was too deep, that they had to come clean. And it 's relatable because I do n't, I do n't like when people use, like, social media and everything to put forth a false image of happiness because what 's more relatable... On social media? I 'm critical of this. But I, the whole point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all relate. We 're more alike than we 're different. So, when people are honest about struggles, whether it 's parenthood or marriage or whatever, more people are, like, oh my gosh, I felt that, too. It 's nice when someone of this level, yeah... And that vulnerability that he 's showing, I mean, he 's supposed to be this hard guy, and he 's like, I messed up. I got a lot of credit, I give him credit for even being able to recognize. It 's hard enough to recognize your own mistakes that you 've made privately, let alone to tell the world, this is my ownership of this period, and this is how he fixed it. So I do n't know. It made me, I do n't know a lot about him personally, but watching this made me want to get to know him more as an artist, as a human behind that art form. So, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well, good for him. Do n't you, do n't you agree, Whoopi? I do not. She and I were like... Listen. Your business is your business, to me. And I, you know, it 's how I was raised. You do n't put all your business out. People are not all in your stuff. And I get that the new generation, they got to tell everything. And these are artists. They are. So these may be artistically told, okay. You will never actually know what 's gone on in their lives. That 's the truth. That 's what I can tell you. Yeah because they are private. They 're private people. You 're not going to know. And it 's very nice that it, that it seems like that, but let 's be realistic here, you know, the... But maybe it 's what he said in the first line, when he said there was so much that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it, like, because their life is very public. So this is a fake song? I do n't know if it 's a... No. No. Well, what she 's saying, you do n't know, like the email. Well, no, you do n't. You do n't know, you do n't know people 's real lives. These are, these are real people who are artists, who are writing, you know, the music of their lives. It does n't mean it 's the reflection of their lives. Let 's be realistic with these kinds of things. I believe everything I hear. I know you do. I 'd like, I 'd like to believe it, too. But, you know, that does n't mean that he 's not a great guy, and she 's not a great girl. It just means, like, look, a lot of people do n't tell you everything. But it was a nice apology. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not telling you everything. We 'll be right back. Remember how we talked about the couch earlier? Well, apparently people at home have been tweeting Joy with pictures of their couches. Let 's take a look at one. That 's the one. That 's not it. That 's Joy 's couch. Here 's, here 's one, yeah, there it is. If you want it. That looks very much like the Urban Outfitter. That is the couch. She says, " I have the couch if you want it. " It 's a different color, but it 's... Is there another one? " I have the couch if you want it, " says( inaudible). Yeah, hers is purple. Well, I have to tell you, this is more royal. I like it. Purple is gorgeous. Yeah, that color actually... I like this one. That color works better in my room. It does. And the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? My final offer is $200, right, Sara? You lowered the cost. My final offer is $200. You know what? If you want it, you should give her $1,000. But this is somebody else. This is( inaudible). Joy, stand with me, stand me. Marcus, we 'll give you $200 for that couch. $200, but I ca n't, where is it? I have to ship it? Where is it? Well, there might be shipping. We 're going to have to accept that. We 're going to have to take that blow. I do n't know, we 'll see. I have n't decided. We will keep, she 's going to keep it on her mind. And if other people have this couch... Do n't send anymore. Please tweet us. Let us know because here 's what you 're going to have to do. You 're going to have to split the shipping costs. Oh, go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to. She 's good. You split the shipping costs, and you make sure that it 's shipped first with a little video so Joy can take a look at it, so they can see, so she can see everything. Confirmation. And make sure that it 's actually going to happen. And then we have to confirm that you 're a real person, and she 's not sending money to somebody fake, who is running off. Okay?
