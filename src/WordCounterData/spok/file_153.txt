253941 FARAI @!CHIDEYA, host : This is NEWS &amp; NOTES. I 'm Farai Chideya. What 's the future of the black family economy? A recent Pew Center study said black family finances have improved over the last three decades, but they still have a lot less income and wealth than white families. Some black households are stacking major chips. They 're building a strong financial portfolio that will help them thrive in a shaky economy. Figuring out how to keep the lights on, the babysitter paid and gas in the car is causing families no shortage of financial and emotional stress. To help us talk through these issues, we 've got Boyce Watkins. He 's an economist at Syracuse University and he 's also a father dealing with child support. We also have Andre and Shiffonda Hayward. Five years into their marriage, they have two kids, two jobs, and the bills keep coming. Thank you guys for being with us. Professor BOYCE WATKINS( Finance, Syracuse University) : Thanks, Farai. @!Mr-ANDRE-HAYWARD : Thanks for having me. @!Ms-SHIFFONDA-HAYWA : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, without going too far into your incomes, would you say that together, you make enough money, more than enough money, not enough money, to make ends meet? Shiffonda? @!Ms-HAYWARD : It 's kind of hard because we make enough money, but, like they say, the more money you make, the more money you spend. So we make enough money, but still, what is enough money? There 's never enough money. @!Mr-HAYWARD : It depends on what you - enough for what? We make enough to pay the bills, but we do n't have, you know, it - like I said, it depends on - enough for what? @!CHIDEYA : Now, Andre, I understand that you 've got two girls, 5 and 6 years old, and you are spending a lot of money on gasoline. Gas is going up. Tell us what you do and how much you 're spending on gas. @!Mr-HAYWARD : Okay. I 'm in construction jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from where we live. So, I 'm filling up two days - every two days, and that, monthly, that gets pretty expensive. That 's almost like a car note, and that 's just on gas. @!CHIDEYA : So hundreds of dollars each month... @!Mr-HAYWARD : A month. @!CHIDEYA :... on gas. @!Mr-HAYWARD : Correct. @!CHIDEYA : And Shiffonda, what about you? What 's the job situation on your end? @!Ms-HAYWARD : I work probably maybe 20 miles from our house and I work in a city of Beverly Hills. And coming from L.A. to Beverly Hills, it 's really not that far, but with the traffic and everything, dropping the kids off at school. And the type of car I have, I have a SUV, and the way gas is it 's crazy. I 'm, like, maybe I can fill up once a week, but that one time a week is worth $70 almost. @!CHIDEYA : Where does the emotion come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young kids, you 're not different from so many millions of families, and that has got to stress you out. I guess, Shiffonda first and then Andre, how does it affects your ability to just feel relaxed on the day-to-day. @!Mr-HAYWARD : What 's that? @!Ms-HAYWARD : It has been a lot... @!CHIDEYA : What 's that? You say, relax, what 's that? @!Mr-HAYWARD : Yeah, yeah, what 's that? @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Ms-HAYWARD : Exactly. We have two kids, and taking care of a household is really hard. It 's really not relaxing because sometimes you wonder - you never know what 's going to happen the next day, and it 's really hard. It 's - there 's no relaxation whatsoever because the kids are always going to need something or something always go wrong in the house or with cars and you always - we have to keep our cars - we have to maintain them really good because like my husband he works so far out and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids in my car and I have, you know, get back to work and taking them to school. So, no, there 's no relaxation whatsoever. It 's - it can cause emotional problems a lot. @!Mr-HAYWARD : Let me give you a quick rundown on an average day for me. @!CHIDEYA : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-HAYWARD : I start my day between 4:00 and 4:30 every day because I got to get myself time to get to work, so that 's an hour. Work - own them up. And once I get off work, I immediately go pick the kids up from school, or soon as I get home, got to help them with their homework, get them situated. Now, we end today early evening. Sometimes, I got to get dinner cooked because like, she said, she 's in a lot of traffic and she 's - she gets off work right in rush hour with everybody else. So sometimes I got to get dinner started or whatever, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started, get them ready for the next day. So now we 're into the early night. Its 7, 8 o'clock, and like I said, I start my day so early in the morning. I need to be in the bed by 9, 10 o'clock. So it 's like I 'm going 24 hours - it 's like nonstop, and it 's an everyday thing. @!CHIDEYA : Well, let me bring Boyce in here now. @!Mr-WATKINS : Yeah. @!CHIDEYA : You are an economist at Syracuse. Give us a sense of the big picture, because I understand that you say that while there 's some progress in incomes, you call it awkward progress. What do you mean and how does that relate to the stories that you 've been hearing from Andre and Shiffonda? @!Mr-WATKINS : Well, I think the story is quite typical. I mean, not only have I studied this, but I have lived this. I remember my mother 's car get repossessed when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought somebody stole it. And I was shocked when she grabbed the phone and hung it up. You know, I can say that in the big picture, basically, African-Americans - what 's really going on is that our wealth levels are less than one-fourth on average compared to whites ; homeownership - less than half of us own our own homes. As far as the 1.2 million black-owned businesses in America, which is a very small number, 1.1 million of those businesses have no employees. So the fact is that, overall, in the big picture, the legacy, the 400-year legacy of economic exclusion of the black community, we build the country but we were not compensated for that. The inability of our parents and grandparents to pass that wealth down to us does sort of lead us to be born into a struggle that we have to fight through. Now, that does n't mean that we ca n't possess good values and ca n't make good decisions, which these people obviously are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have. But the fact is that they 're not alone in this struggle. @!CHIDEYA : Give us a little bit more background on you because you have a child, you 've obviously got a good job, but how does - give us a sense of how - what you 're struggling with, I guess, you know, even if it may not be tight? @!Mr-WATKINS : Well, in so many ways, I was blessed enough to have, really, to some extent been a walking statistic. Almost everything that happens to a black male, I experienced it just enough to barely escape those problems. You know, my best friend was shot in the head, I had a child when I was 18 years old, we grew up in poverty, my mother was 16 years old when she got pregnant with me, we lived in the projects together - the list kind of goes on and on. I really ended up here by accident, which makes me so committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can admit - I 'm very open about my experience. I probably pay more enough child support to fund the Pentagon for a year. And I know that what happens is that, you know, with me being economically successful that child support is not just child support. It becomes mommy-and- daddy support, uncle support, cousin support. You know, my daughter 's siblings are being supported by their money because their father is incarcerated, which is where he 's been for the past 12 or 13 years. And I 'm not saying this to talk about him per se because that 's not - that is another bigger picture in itself. In the last numbers of African-American males that are being incarcerated, many times, some guys do commit crimes and do things that are illegal, but the punishment does n't fit the crime. Almost every statistic shows that. So all these issues with black man being pulled away, the lack of wealth being passed from one generation to the next, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the structure and in the awkward progress of the black family, because the thing is that we ca n't just paint a doom-and-gloom scenario. Let 's be clear, there are more African-Americans - they have the advanced degrees now than they ever were before. In 2004, we had 624,000. Now, we have 1.1 million. More African-Americans are own - owning their own homes and our wealth and income is increasing. But the fact is that it took 400 years to build this problem. We ca n't fix it in 10 or 20. @!CHIDEYA : Well, Boyce, I just want to reintroduce for folks who were just tuning in. This is NEWS &amp; NOTES. I 'm Farai Chideya. We were just hearing from Boyce Watkins. He 's an economist at Syracuse University, also a father dealing with child support. And we also have on the line Andre and Shiffonda Hayward, five years into their marriage. They have two kids, and two jobs, and plenty of bills, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps you going when you might find yourself a little stretched? @!Ms-HAYWARD : Our kids. @!Mr-HAYWARD : Yeah. @!Ms-HAYWARD : I mean, wanting them - I mean, I want my kids to never have to want for anything. You know, I mean, I 'm just not going to give them anything just because they asked for it. They 're going to have to deserve it, but it 's just I want them to have a better life than we did. @!Mr-HAYWARD : I agree. I just - they did n't ask - they would n't, you know, they did n't ask to be here. We decided to have on them. We brought them into this situation, and like she said, I was just living it to Boyce, right? @!Mr-WATKINS : Yeah. @!Mr-HAYWARD : I agree with everything he said his life. If - it 's so hard to get ahead today. You need - it 's almost like you need somebody to - like a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house or their grandparent 's house. They ca n't go out and buy a house. And it 's like, I think all the time, I need to get a house today so, if I 'm not - if something happens for me in the future, my kids have somewhere to stay or my grandkids. And it 's like - it 's just hard out here, like you say it is, to fix the problem in 10 or 20 years. And I like to think I 'm making all the right decisions, but it just seem like I ca n't get over that... @!CHIDEYA : Now, Andre and Shiffonda, you 've been together - from what I understand - for 10 years. You 're still in - both still in your 20s and how do you - what 's your dream, Shiffonda, for how things might play out over the next 30, 40 years? Do you see yourself being able to retire at an age where you can still enjoy life? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable? @!Ms-HAYWARD : Yes, I really do. It 's funny because I was talking to Andre not too long ago about it because he kind of brought up the subject of having another baby. And I explained to him, I 'm like, are you sure about this? I 'm like, we 're finally at this, like, peak where we 're getting to enjoy our life, you know. It 's like we really do n't have to worry about - you know, we really do n't have to, like, start living from paycheck to paycheck anymore. We 're like comfortable with our living status and our, you know, we 're not living above our means. And I just, like, really wanted to talk to him to make sure like, you know, are you sure about this because we 're comfortable where we are now. You know, we 're finally able to relax and really do n't have to worry about, you know, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids to be able - I want to be able to, like, start saving money for my kids. So when it 's time for them to go to college, they do n't have to keep taking out these big loans and have to worry about those back, you know. That they - grade wise, yes, it 'll be great if they can get a scholarship, but if not, I want to be able to help them go to college and not have to worry about paying loans back. @!CHIDEYA : Andre, do you have a master plan for how you 're going to achieve this? Or do you just try to make good decisions on the week to week? @!Mr-HAYWARD : In all honesty, I just try to make a good decision week to week. And I was just listening to find out what she just said. What she said is true, but I was sitting here listening and I 'm thinking, we - what she mean by comfortable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm paying check for being broke, you know what I 'm saying? If something really happens, we do n't really have that much money saved up. But we do - we have lot money than we had a few years ago. You know what mean? @!CHIDEYA : Yeah, well, Boyce, is that common? Is it common for people to be what some folks call a paycheck away from disaster? @!Mr-WATKINS : Yeah, that 's not just the black problem. That 's really an American problem. But as we - most of us know, whatever happens to the rest of America comes down about 10 times harder on the black community. One of the things I can say to this couple to really help them work through this situation. Is number one, I 'm very proud of both of you. You know, when I listen to the brother talk, what I really respect most about this man is that he is trying, he 's committed and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his most valuable assets in the world are not financial. It 's the fact that he has a family that loves him and supports him and he has to remember that the richest people in the world sometimes do n't have any money at all. And sometimes the poorest people in the world can have billions. The other thing to remember is that anybody can say - when I did research this summer with the Centre for European Economic Research, one of my German colleagues came to me and said, what is wrong with Americans is the way they manage their money. He said Germans make less than Americans do, we pay more taxes than Americans do, but we save five times more money than Americans do. So people who tell me they ca n't save, they 're probably wrong. The third thing I will say is that my grandmother who never went to college, never made more than $20,000 a year, but was always financially independent and having been married since she was 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my Ph.D. - she said, if you are a saver, you will always have money, if you are a spender, you will always be broke. Because when spenders get more money, they spend more. When savers get more money, they save more. So most of money management are getting ahead financially is psychological. All the technical magic and mumbo jumbo is really just sort of icing on the cake. @!CHIDEYA : Well, what do you say, I mean, Andre and Shiffonda are not spending more than their means, but what advice - and I know that you 're an economist, not a personal finance person - but what advice would you have for just putting a little bit away for the future? @!Mr-HAYWARD : Yeah. @!Mr-WATKINS : Well, number one, I would recommend definitely keeping a budget. Because it 's hard to know where you 're going if you do n't know where you are and where you 've been. And a lot of people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go a long way in terms of helping you manage your money. The second thing I would remind anybody is to think ownership. You know, I really believe this is part of a legacy about slave mentality. I talked to even a lot of doctors and lawyers who go to school so they can get a good job working for somebody else. And I say that, you know, I believe in not just getting a good job, I believe in creating a job. They - you know, they say if you get - buy man a fish, you 're feeding him for a day. If you teach him how to fish, you feed for a lifetime. Well, the person who 's really getting over is the person who owns the land that the pond is on, who 's - he rented it out to people teaching each other how to fish. So own something whether it 's your home, your business or whatever the case may be. That is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality that we need to have as African-Americans. @!CHIDEYA : Andre and Shiffonda, when you hear this, does this sound like something that is in your reach or something that 's just a dream? @!Mr-HAYWARD : Well, it seems feasible. It seems like that could be reached because, like - what 's the word I want to use? I agree with him. I agree with him 100 percent. Like Fonda had said a moment ago, we just, in recent months, just kind of starting making that transition where we could start saving a few extra dollars. Cut, you know, cut back on some of the - not really blowing money or really just managing our money better. I 'll say that in. I want to make that step like, you know, owning our home. I 'll use that for example. That 's my first step, buying the house that I 'm in now and taking it from there. I 'm really just - after years of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I mean, 13, 14, and this seem like it 's just finally starting to payoff and I 'm( unintelligible). I 'm talking 15 years of hard work and it 's just now starting to payoff. @!CHIDEYA : Well you know what, we 're going to have to end this here, but we would like to talk to all of you again. You have some valuable insights. Andre, Shiffonda, Boyce thank you so much. @!Mr-WATKINS : Thanks for having me. @!Mr-HAYWARD : Thank you. @!Ms-HAYWARD : Thank you. @!CHIDEYA : We 've been talking with Andre and Shiffonda Hayward. They are a working-class Los Angeles couple who are making it work and working on making it better. Boyce Watkins is a finance professor at Syracuse University.
