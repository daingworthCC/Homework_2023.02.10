So with fertility help, they had a set of twins. Then they decided to do it again. They had another set of twins. And then they decided just one more baby, one more baby. But God laughed and said, ' How about six? " @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) Welcome to the joyful chaos of yearning fulfilled times 10. You might as well try to herd kittens.

She has cerebral palsy, raising all those questions. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) There are a lot of serious questions people have about fertility medicine and the consequences of fertility medicine. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently? @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# The, the object of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and, and my one daughter. And I came from a family of three boys and one daughter, which was myself. And I always wanted a sister. So we decided, ' Well, let 's try for one more. See if we get a girl. And if we get twins, that 's fine. " @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) I heard about that. @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# And, you know, we hit the jackpot. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Can you do the expression on your face when you heard about six? @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# It was gradual. @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# I, well, you know, it was, it was gradual because when they said there was three, possibly five because the eggs had n't developed all the way. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Right. @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# @(Inaudible). We went back the next week and there was five. Going back next week, and he looks over at me on the table and he goes like this to me because I did n't wan na tell her.

It 's called selective reduction. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Selective reduction not an issue, not an option? @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# Not an option. @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# You tell me right now who you would n't want to be here? Pick one, pick two, pick three, tell me. I could n't do that. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) You must run into people who go, who think there 's something wrong. I mean who really want to argue with you that you should n't have done this. @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# Well, it 's, it 's our choice. I mean they 're not living my life, you know. They can live their life the way they want to. We 're quite happy. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) And they say when they look at Rebecca... @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# She 's a great joy to me as, as, you know, I feel like she 's my hero. She took one for the team. Everybody else is completely healthy, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na lump it all into one and he gave it to her, and she 's gon na go right to Heaven because she ca n't commit any sins. That 's how I feel. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) The older twins, 9-year-olds Kieran and Meghan, and the 11-year-olds, Kevin and Kyle, they do what they can to help with the often literally dirty half dozen. @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# On the monitor, I heard ' I sticky. " And I said, ' Uh-oh. What is she sticky from? " And I walked in the door and Rachel and Eric and Connor were covered head to toe in baby ointment, everywhere. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) They 've just done a little cosmetic work on themselves. @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# Walls, their cribs, their hair, the carpet, everywhere. @!CHILD-@1FEMALE@2-# The carpet. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) The Hayes say the secret of each day is a constant schedule, gratitude and laughter, including at the so-called traumas they see on shows like ' Super Nanny. " @!CLIP-FROM- " SUPER-N# @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE# I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there... @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) Oh, you do? @!ERIC-HAYES-@1FATHE#... because we 're handling it with 10 and they have one and two, and they, they 're going bananas. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) In their case, food, carefully planned, and a lot of it. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Two gallons of milk, one gallon of orange juice, 128 gallons of Juicy Juice, one loaf of bread, two bunches of bananas, two bunches of grapes, one bag of apples, one Costco sized Goldfish crackers for food in one day. Six loads of laundry a day? @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# Easy. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Easy. @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# Yeah. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Diapers? 252 a week? @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# @(Off-camera) Well, if it 's, it 's 30 to 36 a day.

Six crying babies can make more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway, an ambulance siren or a chain saw. @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# When they were infants, all six of them would be crying and I would just stand there and I 'd just start to laugh because there 's really nothing you can do outside of, you know, crying. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) What about the immense cost involved with this? Did you sort of reel from... @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# I try not to think about it. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Yeah. @!ELIZABETH-HAYES-@1# I think I saw on the Internet that it costs $250,000 to raise one child. And then I started doing the math and I thought, '( Makes noise), I, I just ca n't even think about it.
