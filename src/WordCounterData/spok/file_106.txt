237341 @!LOWRY : Welcome back to " Hannity &amp; Colmes. " I 'm Rich Lowry in for Sean Hannity tonight. The immigration bill that died on the floor of the Senate last week may live to see another day. Senate leaders have agreed today to bring the bill back to the floor as early as next week. But will Congress ever agree to pass this far-reaching legislation? Joining us now is Republican strategist Karen Hanretty and FOX News political analyst and writer at Gather.com, Laura Schwartz. Ladies, thanks so much for being with us. @!LAURA-SCHWARTZ-DE : Hey, thanks for having us. @!LOWRY : Now, Laura, let me start with you, the real world example of how this bill is going to work if it 's passed. If this bill passes, someone who was here illegally in December ' 06 will get to stay. Someone who was here legally on a temporary work visa or some other visa will have to leave. Does that make any sense to you? Does that seem fair? @!SCHWARTZ : Well, we 're going to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, right now, we 're at the starting point where Senator Reid has agreed that each side can levy about 11 amendments each. That very well will be one of those amendments offered by the Republicans, you can be sure of that. But I think this is a good approach. We 're going to start on this. And you know what? I think this just might pass, because there 's 80 percent of the Democrats that are for it. They just need a handful of Republicans to make the majority, and I think they 've got a good chance. I really actually was very happy that President Bush went up there and talked to his caucus this week. Everybody is worried about border enforcement and security, and this puts that first and deals with the path to citizenship second. @!LOWRY : Now, Karen, unfortunately, I think Laura may be right about this, it probably is going to pass. But let me go back to the question I just asked. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are here legally. If you snuck in prior to January of ' 07, you get privileged over people who were here legally on temporary visas then. @!KAREN-HANRETTY-RE : Yes, not only that, but imagine how inefficient the DMV is, when you go stand in line, or you make a phone call, and you reserve a place in line at the DMV, and yet you get there, and things still do n't work on time. That 's the same government bureaucracy that is going to handle these 12 million to 20 million illegal immigrants and sort through all of them. @!LOWRY : It 's the same people who ca n't get the passports to people on time. @!HANRETTY : Yes, you ca n't even get a passport to Mexico and Canada on time. And these people are somehow magically going to hand out, you know, like 12 million number-two pencils so they can get all these illegal immigrants to fill out standardized tests, teach them English. The whole thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HANRETTY : No one has confidence it can happen. @!LOWRY : Laura, I 'll get you in, in a second. Laura, let me ask you though... @!HANRETTY : They need to focus on security first and prove to us that you do security. @!LOWRY : Laura... @!SCHWARTZ : And they do focus on security first, Karen. @!LOWRY : Laura, one second. Laura, let me ask you this. Why is your side of the debate so afraid of the word " amnesty "? That 's exactly what this bill is. You have all these illegal immigrants who are going to be made legal without any condition. And then all the conditions come later, but they get the amnesty upfront. @!SCHWARTZ : Well, first of all, it 's not amnesty. They have to go forward at the -- they have to go through a path to citizenship where they go to the end of the line, they learn English, they pay taxes, they pay a fine. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get back in line of everybody else that 's already here. That 's not amnesty. @(CROSSTALK) @!SCHWARTZ : That whole amnesty bumper sticker is n't working, because you know what? Sixty-five percent of this country is on a path to citizenship. @!LOWRY : Not liberal enough, right, Alan? @!SCHWARTZ : And, listen, Rich, if you use the word " amnesty " in the polls, still a majority of Americans... @(CROSSTALK) @!COLMES : Hold on. Everybody is talking at once. @(CROSSTALK) @!SCHWARTZ :... is n't working anymore. @!COLMES : One at a time. Look, this is a bad bill, and I disagree with everybody on this panel. Laura, it 's not amnesty, for one thing. And I 'll tell you why this -- new provisions, there Are 11 amendments on each side they 're throwing in here. Now, one of them is a touchback provision. If you 're an adult here illegally, you 've got to go back to your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States. And, Karen, that 's not amnesty. But, Laura, it 's also a bad idea, because it 's going to drive illegals underground. They 're not going to participate. This is never going to work for the opposite reasons that Rich thinks. But the touchback provision is a killer. You do n't agree with that, Laura? @!SCHWARTZ : I think the touchback is going to be taken out, to be totally honest, next week, because I think there 's too many people that just do n't see it working. And when you look at the national security benefit of this immigration proposal, it really is to bring people out of the shadows. @!COLMES : Well, this will only put them back in the shadows. And the other -- Karen Hanretty, you and the other people who oppose this bill from the right refuse to address the people already in this country. That 's where George W. Bush is right. There, I said it. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States who are not going away. You want to ignore them? @!HANRETTY : You know what? I think a lot of Americans, including me, want, and where President Bush gets it wrong, and the only time you would ever side with President Bush is when he 's wrong, Alan. That 's so typical. @(CROSSTALK) @!COLMES : You know, a stopped clock is right twice a day, right? Go ahead. @!HANRETTY :... is the fact that, again, it really goes back to confidence. I do n't think the American people have confidence in the government to figure out who is here. @!COLMES : All right, tell me what you 're going to do with the people... @!HANRETTY : You do n't know who is here. @!COLMES : What are you going to do with the people here? What are you going to do with them? @!HANRETTY : I 'll tell you exactly. I think that the American people, right and left, would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant some form of amnesty -- if you did, first and foremost, a security bill for, let 's say, a period of two to five years, prove that you can stop the illegal immigration, and then deal with the people who are here. @(CROSSTALK) @!LOWRY : We 're going to bring you guys back in just a second. @!SCHWARTZ : But at that point, we 're going to have 15 million to 25 million here. @!HANRETTY : You 're going to have that anyway, Laura. @!LOWRY : Hold on. Coming up next, Harry Reid feels right at home in front of liberal bloggers, throwing Peter Pace under the bus. But are the bloggers changing their story to protect the Nevada senator? And later, why are celebrities like Mike Tyson infatuated with Cuban guerrilla Che Guevara? We 'll debunk the revolutionary myth and expose the real Che, coming up next. @!COLMES : And we now continue with Republican strategist Karen Hanretty and FOX News political analyst and writer at Gather.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't trust the government to be able to keep track of all -- rather, Karen, you do n't trust the government to keep track of all the people coming into the country. They ca n't logistically get all this done. They 're going to bungle it, but you trust them to do border security and totally close the border and make sure nobody comes in. @!HANRETTY : Yes, I do trust the government. @!COLMES : That they can do? @!HANRETTY : The government should be able to do border security. Of course. If the government ca n't do simple border security, then what is the role of government, if it is not to protect the interests... @!COLMES : Because you ca n't secure a 3,000-mile border. And a wall -- ever hear of a shovel and a ladder? @!HANRETTY : Yes, you can. @!COLMES : A wall is not going to work. @!HANRETTY : Alan, your defeatist attitude never ceases to surprise me. I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!COLMES : I 'm a defeatist? @!HANRETTY : Yes, I have every confidence in the U.S. government to provide security. If the government ca n't provide security, they have absolutely fallen down in one of their most fundamental jobs. @!COLMES : I love how you do n't trust -- Laura Schwartz, I love how conservatives do n't trust the government to all these things... @!HANRETTY : They tend not to be good bureaucrats, but they tend to be good policemen. @!COLMES :... Laura Schwartz, all of a sudden we can trust the government to do what conservatives want them to do? @!SCHWARTZ : Exactly. I know, it confuses me every day, because even like the Democrats, they want the Democrats to put forth a plan. They put it forward, then they do n't like. Then they should have an alternative for their own. You know, Mitt Romney was asked about this immigration bill, and he said he did n't like it, he would n't vote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative? What would your legislation look like? " And he said, " Oh, I do n't want to legislate. " I mean, we have to see some alternatives from the Republicans if they 're going to constantly stonewall this. @!COLMES : By the way, Karen... @!HANRETTY : Yes, we need more bureaucracy. That 's exactly the solution to this problem. @!COLMES : If I could ask you a question... @!SCHWARTZ : Well, let 's have another plan, Karen. I 'm not talking about bureaucracy ; I 'm talking about somebody stepping forward with something. @!HANRETTY : How about put 10,000 border security agents at the border? @(CROSSTALK) @!SCHWARTZ : And where are you going to get them? I think it 's in technology. @!COLMES : Was Ronald Reagan wrong? He granted amnesty. @!HANRETTY : Yes. @!COLMES : The great Ronald Reagan, who -- never speak ill of Ronald Reagan. @(CROSSTALK) @!COLMES :... granted amnesty in 1986? @!HANRETTY : Alan, you never cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, I have said this on your show, to you specifically before, that the 1986 bill, it was not the right thing to do. It failed. It absolutely failed. They had all the right language. And if we have learned nothing from the history of 1986, it is that, you know, they had all of these great bureaucratic processes, you know, to take care of all these illegal immigrants, and they never did, what? Border security. It 's the one thing they did n't do. Why? Probably because the Democrats in Congress did n't take seriously the idea of funding the most fundamental job of government in America, which is to... @!COLMES : Ronald Reagan did it, not the Democrats in Congress. @(CROSSTALK) @!LOWRY : Karen, hold on a second. Laura, you 're asking for an alternative. But can I give you one? Can I give you the Lowry plan? @!SCHWARTZ : That would be great. @!LOWRY : Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill, which everyone, right and left, professes to be in favor of, except for maybe my friend, Alan Colmes, and why do n't we do that first? Then we can do the amnesty later. What would be wrong with that? @!SCHWARTZ : That 's actually how this bill is written, border security and workplace enforcement first. @!LOWRY : No, that 's not true. @!SCHWARTZ : And then the path to citizenship. Your president said it just today. @!LOWRY : He 's wrong. @!SCHWARTZ : It 's in the bill. @(CROSSTALK) @!HANRETTY : I like how you believe Bush when he says something you like. @!SCHWARTZ : Well, you 're looking at a president that just caucused with his Republicans, and Senator Kennedy with the Democrats, and they 're all on the same page. @!LOWRY : Laura, let me explain this, just really quickly. What happens, the bill passes. Pretty much every illegal alien in this country immediately gets legal status. They get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Criminal and otherwise. @!LOWRY : Then the enforcement stuff happens supposedly 18 months later. @!SCHWARTZ : No, criminal does n't get it, Karen. @!LOWRY : Amnesty happens first. @!SCHWARTZ : No, OK, that 's not citizenship, OK? They do n't just get that. @!LOWRY : Legal status, that 's all they care about. @!SCHWARTZ : It 's legal status. It says, " OK, you can stay. " @!LOWRY : That is the amnesty. @!SCHWARTZ : " You have to register with us. If you 're a criminal, you 're going home. " @!LOWRY : That 's fine. You 're illegal, though. You immediately become -- Karen, is n't this an amnesty? If you 're illegal one day, the next day you 're legal, whether the enforcement has happened or not, that is an amnesty. The amnesty happens first. That 's the fundamental problem with this bill, is n't it, Karen? @!SCHWARTZ : So you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $206 billion. @!LOWRY : I spent a lot of time thinking about this issue and talking with people who think a lot about this issue and want to enforce the laws. None of them think we can round up 12 million people and deport them, nor do they propose that. @!SCHWARTZ : Right. Well, you should talk to Kay Bailey Hutchison. @!LOWRY : What people want... @(CROSSTALK) @!LOWRY :... is a serious effort to enforce the law for once before we have an amnesty. @(CROSSTALK) @!HANRETTY : The fundamental difference between the Republicans and the Democrats, it 's very simple, and this bill really summarizes it up. The Republicans, the conservatives in this country, simply want to enforce the rule of law. And the liberals and the Democrats simply want to expand bureaucracy. @!COLMES : That 's why there 's a trigger in the bill, a trigger in the bill... @(CROSSTALK) @!COLMES : We 've got to run. We thank you both, but we 've got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million that are here, Karen? How do you get them out of the shadows? What do you do with those? @!COLMES : They 're going to keep arguing, but we 've got to break. Was Harry Reid wrong for calling General Pace incompetent? Liberal bloggers come to the Nevada senator 's defense. Our next guest says there 's no need to read between the lines. Later, our next guest attempts to unmask the true identity of Cuban icon Che Guevara. That 's coming up, as well. @(NEWSBREAK)
