224641 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : More and more educators are looking at community service as an important part of the learning process. Some state officials in Maryland have come up with a plan to require 75 hours of service before a student can graduate. But not everyone thinks it 's a good idea. Jane Stern is president of the Maryland State Teachers Association. She joins us from Washington, along with Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, director of the Maryland Student Service Alliance. Good morning. Miss JANE STERN( President, Maryland State Teachers Association) : Good morning. @!Ms-KATHLEEN-KENNED : How are you? @!SMITH : Miss Stern, Let me start with you. It seems, at least from hearing about this initially, that 's it 's intriguing, if not downright appealing. What do you think is wrong with it? Miss STERN : Well, first I 'd like to say that the Maryland State Teachers Association is very supportive of voluntary community service programs being made available for students to participate in. Unfortunately, this proposal makes that kind of volunteerism compulsory, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!SMITH : So what 's wrong with it? Miss STERN : Well, for one thing, once you force students to do this, it becomes not something they 're doing because they want to do, but a kind of drudgery. They 're just doing time to fulfill the requirement. It takes away all the joy of volunteering and makes it much less likely that students will volunteer during the rest of their lives. @!SMITH : Could n't you say that about anything else in the classroom? As long as you have to do it, it must be crummy? Miss STERN : Well, I -- I think so. And I think it would be unfortunate if this were -- were added to that list. But the other distinction between doing these things and doing things in the classroom... @!SMITH : All right. Miss STERN :... is that the classroom things are for the student 's own benefit, whereas these services are giving service to the community, working for someone else 's benefit. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of program. @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. We 'll get to that in a second, but Kathleen Kennedy Tolnsend, certainly you 've got to believe that it 's got to be to some -- some benefit to the students or else you would n't be pushing this. What 's -- what 's your idea behind this? @!Ms-TOWNSEND : Sure. I think that young people learn a great deal when they do service. They learn that they have a stake in the community. They learn that their voices count. They learn that they are powerful and they have something to say and to do. I have seen young people who have tutored ; who have worked with the elderly ; who have rehabilitated houses and who afterwards -- who have said that even if it was required, ' I never knew what was going on in my community. I never knew how much I had to offer. ' If you just wait for young people to decide, you 're going to wait a long time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step. @!SMITH : But it -- would n't something like this be subject to some kinds of abuse? You could just see kids out having to just sort of rake the football field on Saturday morning or something like that... @!Ms-TOWNSEND : That 's -- sure... @!SMITH :... instead of out really doing the things that you ideally at least think about, anyway? @!Ms-TOWNSEND : Well, the way that we hope it will be enacted is that -- or implemented -- is that the young people will, in conjunction with their teachers or the school system, decide what kind of service they wish to do. The whole idea is for young people to be able to -- to identify problems in their community, whether its problems in the environment or problems with school funding, which I know Jane Stern is interested in, and devise a program to solve it, so at the end of that 75 hours, with what we call preparation reflection, it 's not just the hours, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Ms-TOWNSEND :... understanding about it. They 'll say, ' You know, I 've made a difference. I am important. ' @!SMITH : What about -- what about the idea, though, that this is an involuntary servitude ; that these kids are being forced to work against their will? @!Ms-TOWNSEND : Well, you know, that 's -- I guess that 's what some people say public school is about. But the fact of the matter is that this is a real learning experience. I do n't ever call this volunteerism. This is learning to be a good citizen. You know, Aristotle said, ' We become good house-builders by building houses. We become harp-players by playing the harp. We learn to do just things by doing just things. ' And the whole idea is that -- or as John Dewey said, ' We have to learn how to act. We have to develop those skills before we become experts in them. ' @!SMITH : Mm. Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this? Miss STERN : Well, we believe that there are probably legal avenues that could be used to fight against this. We think it 's of questionable legality, because the truth is that this notion that we 're going to learn something by doing it could be used to justify many other things, like having to to go and work in a business so that you learn about the business, and being required to do that for no compensation. I mean, when you cross the line and you require labor for no compensation, just because a student has to get a diploma... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. Miss STERN :... then I think that you are using your power to coerce students in a way that 's inappropriate. It 's educationally unsound, and I think it has these legal problems. @!SMITH : We 'll be watching. Jane Stern, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Do appreciate it. Paula. @!PAULA-ZAHN-@1Co-ho : We 're moving up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up next, the tiger mosquito, spreading the deadly threat of encephalitis. Coming up in our next half-hour on CBS THIS MORNING, Robert Krulwich shows us the German example in the war against waste. Plus Dr. Bob Arnot and the Gulf War 's heroic healer ; Steve Kmetko on location in Rome with actor John Lithgow.
