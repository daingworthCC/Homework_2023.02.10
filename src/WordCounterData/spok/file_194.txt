In other political news this morning, more speculation that former Alaska governor Sarah Palin will make a run for the White House. Tara Mergener is in Washington with more on that.

It premieres next month in Iowa, whose caucuses open the nominating contest. Speculation over Palin 's political plans quieted down a bit when she dropped out of the national spotlight earlier this year. But she restarted the rumor machine last week on FOX News. @!SARAH-PALIN-: And I want to make sure that America is put back on the right track. And we only do that by defeating Obama in 2012. I have that fire in my belly. @!TARA-MERGENER: Then, there 's the house. Palin has reportedly purchased this 1.7 million dollars home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Aides have suggested it could be a campaign headquarters if she moves forward. She has also reshuffled her staff, rehiring some who worked with her in 2008, and she 's expected to soon, as early as this weekend, resume a series of public appearances to raise her profile. @!JAN-CRAWFORD: The speculation now has turned.

Terrell, she 'll face some challenges for sure, if she runs. @!TERRELL-BROWN: She sure will. Tara Mergener in Washington. Tara, thank you so much. Meanwhile, a lawyer for former Senator John Edwards says a federal investigation into Edward alleged misuse of campaign funds is without merit.

Before the ruling, federal marshals had to drag Loughner out of the courtroom after he disrupted the proceedings. He mumbled what sounded like, " thank you for the freak show. She died in front of me. " U.S. Attorney believes he will eventually face justice. @!DENNIS-BURKE-@1U.S: We 're going to make every step we can to ensure that this individual goes to trial for the crimes that the grand jury found he committed. @!TERRELL-BROWN: For now, Loughner will be held in a federal facility in Missouri.

And that she will have a good life, despite what he did to her. @!ELIZABETH-SMART: One day he will have to be responsible for his actions. @!KENDIS-GIBSON: Smart was fourteen-years-old when Mitchell took her at knifepoint from her Salt Lake City bedroom. During his trial last year, she described how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the ordeal.

And the latest crash test results on small cars. Which ones will keep your safest? This is the CBS MORNING NEWS. @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!TERRELL-BROWN: Let 's get another look at this morning 's top stories. More powerful storms and tornadoes pounded the country 's midsection overnight. At least, eighty-one tornadoes were reported. There were warnings and watches in twelve states. No deaths were reported, but dozens were injured. Rescue crews are still looking for survivors in Joplin, Missouri. The death toll there stands at one hundred twenty-five.

Researchers with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety say a record six gas sippers have earned the distinction of being a top safety pick. They are the Ford Focus, the four doors Honda Civic, the Hyundai Elantra, The Lexus CT-200H, the Nissan Juke and the Toyota Prius. Researchers ran the cars through a battery of tests, including front, side, roll-over and rear impact crashes. They say none of the thirteen cars earned a poor rating in any test. And that is a big change from the last few years when small cars struggled to earn top ratings. Researchers say the credit go to the car companies that are making what used to be extra features standard. For example, they all have standard side air bags and most have electronic stability control that can prevent many kinds of crashes. Still researchers say nothing beats the protective armor of a bigger, heavier car, proving that the laws of physics are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity.
