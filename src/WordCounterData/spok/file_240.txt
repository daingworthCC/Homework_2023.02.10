" Always great to be in your presence. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : Thank you. It 's good to see you. You look wonderful. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Good to see you. Thank you, thank you. This movie is right on time, especially with what happened with the Kentucky school shooting. And this is based, your movie is based on a true story. 2013, Georgia, elementary school, a heroic woman got a gunman to surrender. And it 's played, Antoinette Tuff @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : Antoinette Tuff. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 is the real woman and she was at the premiere. What was it like playing her? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : You know, when I think of her role and what she did, I mean this gunman is there. He 's about to kill over 800 kids and faculty members and this woman, through her faith, just talked this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these families were reunited with their kids and they got to tuck them in. You know what I mean? All the stories are n't happy. Like, the Kentucky situation was not a happy ending. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 I know, I know. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : But this woman gave us a happy ending. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 She did. Do you all wan na see a little bit of this? Okay. Here it is. " Faith Under Fire. " @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : Well, as long as I talk to God, that 's how long I got to listen. So if I 'm talking to God 15 minutes, then that 's how long I have to sit in total silence and just listen. Fifteen minutes is a long time when you really try to do it, but I just close my eyes and black out everything. Like @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 What was the reaction to your family and everybody who 's seen it so far? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : They were shocked. They were shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds for it. I lost it, but I gained five back over the holiday. But @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 But who 's counting? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : Yeah, exactly. I, I, I, what do you call it, when you @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Transform, yeah. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : Spray tan. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Oh, the spray tan. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : I spray tanned to make my skin a little darker. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Right. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : The aesthetics I did to prepare for the role. I watched everything Antoinette Tuff. I watched her imaging, I watched her interviews with Cooper, Mr. Anderson Cooper. Everything she did, the 911 call. She was completely calm. Like, how is she so calm? And I think what she was able to do, she was like a negotiator, I remember them saying. I was actually watching it as it was unfolding. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Yeah. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : And I was in Canada. And I 'm on the treadmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta? So when I got the script I 'm like, I remember this story. I mean, she was on the cover of " Time " magazine. President Obama acknowledged her. And it 's just great to have someone give their lives for someone else. ' Cause I 'm a mother and you think you send your kids off to school, you know. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 That they 're safe, yeah. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : They 're safe. You think you 'll see them when you pick them up at 3:00 o'clock, you know, but this woman was fantastic. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 You 're a mother, you 're, a musical family that you come from. Are they showing any interest in doing that? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : No. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Your boys? No? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : No. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 No, no, no? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : No, not at all. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Not so much. @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : They do n't even really even like my voice. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like Toni Braxton 's voice? @1TONI-BRAXTON-FAITH@3 : No. I mean, like Mom 's just, okay, she can sing as Mom, but, Mom, can we go to the Drake concert?

Music is always gon na be in my heart. I mean, acting is not organic for me, like singing is. So I had to study hard for that role, but music is what I do in my sleep.
