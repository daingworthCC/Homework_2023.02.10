5001341 JESSE WATTERS, THE FIVE CO-HOST : Hello, everybody. I 'm Jesse Watters along with Jedediah Bila, Geraldo Rivera, Katie Pavlich, and Greg Gutfeld. It 's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. Fox News alert, President Trump has ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into Judge Kavanaugh as requested by the senate judiciary committee. So, amazing amount of news this afternoon, Greg. First, we find out Jeff Flake, the senator from Arizona, who is not seeking reelection, has told the senate judiciary committee, you know what? I think we need an FBI investigation. And without his vote, I do n't think they might have had the 51 they needed. So it looks like there is now going to be a week-long FBI investigation. GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE CO-HOST : Yeah. You know what? This is definitely not a delay tactic. Not at all. @1WATTERS@2 : Not at all. @1GUTFELD@2 : Not at all. Everybody is so happy to take another week of completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, it was about a drunken assault at 17, and then it was indecent exposure. Then it was like, you know, ruling over gang rape parties. So I 've figured you have a week, you 're going to find out who was drowning orphans in a tub down by the city dump. This is crazy -- I mean, this is all about -- this is n't about deep diving on a specific incident now. It 's about buying more time for the Avenatti 's of the world to drum up other things, I think. @1WATTERS@2 : Because one more week -- what could happen, Geraldo? You could have more women come forward as Chris Coons, the senator from Delaware, admitted. Saying -- he goes, I ca n't control if more women come forward. And how do we know that the lawyers for Ford are n't going to play games and say, you know what? She 's not ready to talk to the FBI. She needs a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, THE FIVE CO-HOST : I do n't think that that 's the risk. I think the risk is the investigation itself. When you launch an investigation as witness by this collusion illusion, once it gets going no one can stop it. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1RIVERA@2 : What if you 're in the FBI? You have a one week limit and you have a witness who 's about to testify -- about to tell or tells you half the story, and then you say, oh, I ca n't tell you -- no. It 's not. KATIE PAVLICH, THE FIVE CO-HOST : I 'm going to push back on that a little bit because the people that the FBI is going to investigate, there may be more witnesses. I hesitate to call them witnesses because they say they were n't there, so how could they have witness a crime? But they have already given sworn statements to congressional investigators. The felony of lying to a congressional investigator is the same as lying to an FBI agent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at the party. They do n't really know what happened at the party because they were n't there. And they 're not really sure if it actually happened. So when the FBI asks them the same questions, they 're already in a position where they are under oath saying it did n't happen. The questions will be the same. @1RIVERA@2 : Let me push back on the push back. Here you have a situation where the nominee has given testimony that the yearbook references, you know, to Renata, or to barfing, and farting, and all these other things mean one thing. Now what if the FBI calls him -- now asks him to testify? Now, you know. @1PAVLICH@2 : Mark Judge? @1RIVERA@2 : Judge Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh. @1PAVLICH@2 : OK. @1RIVERA@2 : All right, Judge Kavanaugh. Here you have a situation. You said -- you gave testimony that that meant Renata -- you were just singing the praises of this one girl that to say a Renata alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all scored with this one lady. Is that true? You know, no, upon refreshing my recollection did mean. @5CROSSTALK@6 Jess : Geraldo, you 're assuming Brett Kavanaugh lied. That 's what you 're assuming. @1RIVERA@2 : I 'm telling you this, Jess. The pro-choice forces in this country are elated today. The pro-life forces in this country are running scared. They are petrified. This has thrown the -- what seems a slam dunk into total disarray. @1GUTFELD@2 : How do you know that? @1RIVERA@2 : Because anything can happen now, Greg. Anything can happen. JEDEDIAH BILA, THE FIVE CO-HOST : What if the president then upset, though. I mean, this guy had six -- this will be now seven FBI background checks. These are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated claims that the only people she said were in the room say they were n't there. They do n't know anything about a party. And. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1BILA@2 :. back up Kavanaugh 's statement. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm saying is this will open up the flood gates. You 're going to have anonymous allegations from all over the place. @1RIVERA@2 : Agree. Agreed. @1BILA@2 : You 're going to have Democrats saying this needs to be investigated. Oh, wait, the FBI investigation was n't thorough enough. Guess what? Anita Hill got an FBI investigation. It lasted 3 days, they found nothing, and Democrats are still -- still saying Clarence Thomas did what he did. They do n't care about the facts. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1GUTFELD@2 : Geraldo, you 're going to bring up what Donald Trump had said about Dr. Ford. @1RIVERA@2 : Yes. @1GUTFELD@2 :. which -- it 's actually accurate. She was compelling, and in my view, credible. That was -- he was credible. @1RIVERA@2 : I agree. @1GUTFELD@2 : Which means, I believe and I think you do, too, that they believe they 're telling the truth, both of them. @1RIVERA@2 : I absolutely believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely agree with you. @1GUTFELD@2 : This is about the flawed nature of memory that one of them might have it wrong, both of them could have it wrong. We will never know. So you have to kind of like. @1BILA@2 : But that 's why witnesses exist. You have two credible people giving credible stories. That 's why you need corroboration. That 's why you need evidence. I mean, Mitchell, who asked great questions, Rachel Mitchell, who does this for a living said I would n't bring this to court. @1GUTFELD@2 : That 's the important part. @1BILA@2 : I would n't bring it to court. I would n't even get a search warrant. There 's nothing there. @1PAVLICH@2 : I think, you know, everyone has been very careful about talking about the credibility of the woman, listening to her answers yesterday from the outside prosecutors. She actually has a lot of things. In fact, she answer that were major, major, discrepancy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post, and what we gave seen her say. For example, she said that she only told her husband and her therapist about the sexual assault. But in yesterday, she said that she actually talked to people on the beach, her beach friends about this, and that 's when she decided to go and contact the media and they encouraged her to do it. There were glaring holes yesterday in her testimony. She could n't remember a number of things that happened in the past seven weeks. Not to mention the past 32 years. I understand things are difficult to remember when traumatic things happen. However, when it comes down to this, all of the evidence of character, which what matters here because it happened so long ago, is on the side of Brett Kavanaugh. The people that she said who were in that room -- the people who said that -- were in that room all say do n't know about it. And everybody else is backing. @1BILA@2 : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's listen from the FBI perspective because they do n't know where this happened, they do n't have a house, and they really do n't know the time frame. They know, maybe, a 6-week time frame. They 're going to ask, generally, the same people that we 've all been hearing about. The alleged witnesses and the two main people involved. Besides the questions that they 've asked yesterday at the hearing, there 's only so much follow-up you can do. And if you ask me, Judge Kavanaugh was meticulous with his calendar. He has an iron-clad memory and can account for much more and in much more details, and has all of the alleged witnesses backing him up. Whereas, as Katie mentioned, Dr. Ford extremely believable but hazy on a lot of key issues. How she got to the party? How she left the party? Where the party was? All of those things are going to be looked at by the FBI investigators, and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the senate judiciary committee, and it 's going to look a lot like what the senate judiciary committee staff found themselves. @1RIVERA@2 : I 've been a combat reporter for decades. This is war. Judge Kavanaugh watching that man yesterday with that weeping and that -- did you do bongs when you were a senator? I mean, he seemed to be hanging by a thread. Now he 's got another week. Another week. And he knows they 're coming at him full bore. They 're going to question every answer he has given up until now. I would be worried that he 's going to crack in the next week. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1GUTFELD@2 : That 's what they 're hoping for. They 're hoping that this guy is n't going to -- is n't going to survive. I think he is because I think -- he 's not fighting for the Supreme Court seat now. He 's fighting for his name and he 's fight for his family. He 's fighting for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this. The thing is, I do n't know if it matters what you feel at this point because the process is a sham, right? We know the process is a sham. @1RIVERA@2 : It is. @1BILA@2 : Rachel Mitchell said as well. This is not the way to do this. @1GUTFELD@2 : I think that 's why you end up with the fact that, like, you could see she 's credible and you could see that he 's credible because the process is corrupted, so that you ca n't actually get to the facts. Like, feelings be damned, you 've got to get the evidence. And have we moved the ball anywhere on evidence? No. @1BILA@2 : The goal is to taint him. The goal is to taint him so badly, and ruin his reputation so badly and have the polling be so bad that they want him pulled so they have to go through this entire process, start to finish with someone else. Who, by the way, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue. @1RIVERA@2 : There 's no time. There 's no time. @1WATTERS@2 : I think we have John Roberts who is standing by in Washington, D.C. to update us with the latest from the White House. What are you hearing, John? @1JOHN-ROBERTS-FOX-NE@3 : Jesse, good afternoon to you. Well, we knew that the president 's hands were tied once the judiciary committee issued the request over to the White House for the president to ask the FBI to open up a, quote, supplemental investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh 's background. The president did n't really have much choice. So that 's when we got the statement from Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders which said, I 've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh 's file as the senate has requested. This update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week. And that 's where the argument, really, is going to come down here. Limit in scope, how do you limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? The request from the judiciary committee was for all current, credible allegations to be investigated? Now, does that limited just to Christine Blasey Ford? Does that include Deborah Ramirez? Does that include Michael Avenatti 's client? I think that the White House and Republicans would argue that this is limited only to the Christine Blasey Ford allegation. In which case, you would interview her, you would interview the judge, Judge Kavanaugh, you would interview the other judge, Mark Judge, and other people who were said to be at that party. And now, remember, this is not a criminal investigation. First of all, they 're not investigating alleged crime that happened some 36-years-ago. This is merely collecting background information. And it does not come to any kind of conclusion. Any conclusion on the information contained would have to be made by either the White House or the senate in this case. It 's already gone through the judiciary committee. So it will be the full senate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also released a statement this afternoon saying, quote, throughout this process I 've been interviewed by the FBI, I 've done a number of background calls directly with the senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the senators and their council asked me. I 've done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. Geraldo said just a short time ago, this is war, and he 's absolutely correct about this. After what has gone on with this nominee, it is now all-out-war between Republicans and Democrats. I was talking to a prominent Republican political operative just a short time ago, who told me wait until the next seat in the Supreme Court comes up. Maybe it 's Ruth Bader Ginsburg or somebody like that. And rather than following tradition of nominating a more liberal judge the president may go for the hardest, hardest core conservative that he can find to fill that position. So, Geraldo, you 're right. This is political war here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I appreciate the props. I appreciate the props also. But Kavanaugh 's statement does not go far enough. I would say to him if he were my client, I would say, judge, I want you to go out there and say you welcome a full throated investigation. @1PAVLICH@2 : He did. @1RIVERA@2 :. probe it. I want you to. @1PAVLICH@2 : He said that. @1RIVERA@2 : I want you to uncover every. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1GUTFELD@2 : Geraldo, if you 're innocent, you do n't have to. It 's like, hell no. Go screw yourself. I 'm innocent. The other thing about the scope of this thing, it is amazing that the Democrats are pleading for more time. Let 's not rush the judge when they already judged this guy not plausible to be on the court before the guy even got there. @1WATTERS@2 : And they knew about this in July and August. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. @1RIVERA@2 : Right. @1WATTERS@2 : So this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI investigation a long time ago, and it could have been much more than a week. They came to play now. @1RIVERA@2 : This is an attempted coup. I think that what the Democrats have done has been absolutely premeditated. They had a very weak hand. They do n't have the White House. They do n't have the house. They do n't have the senate. They were playing with a very weak hand. What they did was they had the complaint, it was many weeks ago. It could have been thoroughly, sincerely, investigated in a timely fashion, but they have succeeded in by dropping it at the 11th hour by this bomb exploding right at the end. They have succeeded in prolonging the process. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1RIVERA@2 : You 're exactly right. @1WATTERS@2 : More than a month now. @1RIVERA@2 : Mid-terms are a couple of weeks that way, and then Christmas holidays. Then you get the new government. What if the Democrats win the senate. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1PAVLICH@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emails all day from far left groups saying even if Kavanaugh comes back clean from the FBI, he 's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court. Which is why I question today, Jeff Flake who went back on his word just hours after being, you know, releasing a statement saying he would confirm Brett Kavanaugh, he gets bullied in the lobby of a senate hall on a elevator by two women screaming at him, and then he had a conversation with Chris Coons and goes back on his word and says I want a FBI investigation. I 'm not going to confirm Kavanaugh on the full floor until it is done despite promising the country that it would get done today. @1WATTERS@2 : This reminds me, I think it was his colleague, Senator John McCain who at the last minute came in for that vote on the Obamacare repeal and went like that. @1PAVLICH@2 : Right. @1WATTERS@2 : And another Arizona senator did the exact same thing. I do n't know if the motivations were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said it was about bringing the country together over bipartisanship with regards to healthcare. Flake is singing the same tune. @1BILA@2 : The motivation. @1WATTERS@2 :. brought forward for the rest of the country would bring on. @1BILA@2 : Jeff Flake wants to be loved by the media. He wants to be the Republican that gets the good headline. Oh, I did what I could that corralled everybody. @1WATTERS@2 : And he 's running for president we think, too. @1BILA@2 : Nobody cares. I hate to say it. I do n't know what happened 36- years-ago, but no one cares at all that Brett Kavanaugh -- there has been no -- there 's no evidence that was brought against this guy. There 's no corroboration. Now this guy. @1RIVERA@2 : Do n't say nobody cares. @1BILA@2 : Nobody cares he has to wait an extra week. @1RIVERA@2 : Everybody cares. @1BILA@2 : He brought up a great point. Yesterday, he said an extra week? That feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This guy has a reputation. And he knows that every single day that passes that this gets prolonged, the media has the opportunity to dig him in a deeper and deeper hole. And one hundred percent. @1WATTERS@2 : And we have some. @1BILA@2 : There 's no evidence. @1WATTERS@2 :. new information from Ed Henry who I believe has some statement from the Ford team. @1ED-HENRY-FOX-NEWS-C@3 : Yes. Dr. Ford 's statement, Jesse, her attorney Debra Katz just put out a statement and this could be a big problem in terms of potentially blowing up this tentative deal we 've keep hearing about to delay this only one week because listen closely. Debra Katz, Dr. Ford 's attorney, a thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts. Dr. Christine Ford welcomes this step in the process and appreciates the efforts of senator 's Flakes, Murkowski, Manchin, and Collins, and all the other senators who have supported an FBI investigation to ensure it is completed before the senate votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Here 's the bad part for the senate leaders, no artificial limits they say as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation. Well, what does that mean? That means that Dr. Ford 's team is saying no to a one week deadline as the president has ordered and Senator Flake and others have promised to. And they 're also saying no limit on scope. What does that mean? Well, the senate judiciary committee said the deal is that they 're only looking at current and credible allegations, as in the Dr. Ford allegations that are considered current before them and considered credible. Even the president said that Dr. Ford was credible in her testimony yesterday. Meaning, if Michael Avenatti or someone else comes up with something new over the weekend, or next Tuesday, or next Wednesday, that might not be deemed credible and is not currently before the judiciary committee, they were not supposed to look at it. Dr. Ford 's legal team is saying the opposite in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should look at anything and everything. That is just what conservatives feared, and now Dr. Ford 's team has opened the door. @1WATTERS@2 : Thank you very much, Ed. I appreciate the update. It does have to be said though that Democrats and the Ford lawyers, they do n't control the process. They 're not in the senate. They 're not in the White House. These are lawyers who are representing this woman within this, you know, political circus. They ca n't say, oh, we want unlimited scope. They ca n't say we want unlimited scope and they have to agree to that. This is a request that they 're making and it 's clearly partisan. @1RIVERA@2 : Can say they say this. Can they say, the Ford lawyers and so forth, how can you not investigate an allegation as salacious and as destructive as the contention that the nominee of the Supreme Court participated in gang rapes? @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : I would say this. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side, I would say if that 's the serious allegation take it up with the local law enforcement people because that 's their jurisdiction. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1BILA@2 : The problem is, though, because this is being tried in the court of public opinion, so no matter what you do it 's never going to be enough. No matter how much time you delegate. No matter what you do. And I promise you, if they look into that case, there will be another case. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1RIVERA@2 : I detest that sleazy porn lawyer, I feel about him, Avenatti, exactly as the president does. But it is impossible in the current climate in our divided country to ignore allegations. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1PAVLICH@2 : When you look at the details of the Avenatti 's -- publication that he put out to talk about this allegation, the allegations are laughable and should have never ever been printed by any media outlet because you were smearing someone without any evidence. And the idea that we are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence is on his side to investigation allegations of gang rape, by a woman, who, by the way, her ex-boyfriend had to file a restraining order against her after she threaten him, his wife and his child is absurd. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1PAVLICH@2 : No, you do n't. You were correct on the idea that they will continue to say this. How can you not have more time than a week to investigation allegations of gang rape? You need 3 months to investigate all of those claims. The bottomline is this is war, as you 've said. Republicans are going to have to stick to their one week timeline, and the president is going to have to hold them to it as well, because this will never ever end. They 're holding this confirmation hostage. And they 're moving the goal post to infinity. That is exactly. @1WATTERS@2 : Also, very suspicious, the lawyer who represented the person that 's making the gang rape claim with Avenatti, the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very interesting connection, Greg. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yeah. That 's evidence of pure tribalism. There are two groups pitting against each other. And the thing is, I do n't think the Republicans -- like they expected something fierce, but I did n't think they expected how low this could go. And the process is now schizophrenic. So what the Republicans and right minded people are thinking, well, it will be a fact finding procedural. No, it will be just like yesterday where you have an investigator asking questions than then kind of validate what we 've already know. But then on the other side you 're going to have this high emotional drama that will paint this guy as some kind of unstable sexual assaulter. @1BILA@2 : Anyone can say anything to derail a nomination. You do n't need evidence. You do n't need proof. You do n't need corroboration. And if that evidence -- the only person here who presented anything was Brett Kavanaugh. He showed his calendar, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought was insane. And the people that Ford claimed were there backed him up. They said, either, they were n't at the party, they do n't remember it, or they praised Kavanaugh 's character. You can not have a situation where somebody comes to the table and under testimony tells his truth and there 's no evidence against him, and now you demand further investigation. That 's not how it works. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1GUTFELD@2 : But what about the deep state? @1PAVLICH@2 : Due process. Due process. @1GUTFELD@2 : Where 's Rod Rosenstein? @5CROSSTALK@6 @1PAVLICH@2 : If this goes down, due process in America goes down with it. @1RIVERA@2 : This nation is rivet. We are divided right in half. There 's the right. There 's the left.( INAUDIBLE) And the issue is abortion. This is Roe v. Wade. This is something that is so deeply, deeply emotional. There 's so many people on both sides. This is a generational thing. @1WATTERS@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new statement by Kavanaugh 's people. And this is how it reads, hear this, throughout this process I 've been interviewed by the FBI. I 've done a number of background calls directly with the senate. And yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the senators and their counsel asked me. I 've done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate. So that statement. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1BILA@2 : No conditions from him. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : And I understand why yesterday he hedged a little bit. He said I 'll answer any question. I do n't care who investigates. But at the same time, are you going to trust this committee and this environment to not smear you for another additional week with false allegations? According to him. Geraldo, you did touch on something and it is all about abortion because the other day Juan Williams told me the exact same thing. The three fiercest fights for replacing Supreme Court people, Bork, Clarence Thomas, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were replacing justices that had written a majority opinion in Roe and Casey. And now, Kavanaugh come in replacing Kennedy who wrote the majority opinion in Casey, which is kind of the, you know, the affirmation of Roe v. Wade, and it is gotten so ugly and so disgusting -- I think it was the senator from Louisiana, Republican candidate, he said this is an intergalactic freak show. And Greg 's right, the Republicans were not prepared for this level of ugliness. Greg, I think you have a monologue? @1GUTFELD@2 : I do. Thank you. Good transition there, Jesse. You 're always good at that. All right the lesson this week, politics is a game that turns players into monsters and monsters into players. When Diane Feinstein got Dr. Ford 's allegation she was a player. But rather than hold a private meeting about these allegation which would have protected the families and lives of both Kavanaugh and Ford, Feinstein sat on it until it could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrick Garland. And here 's the key part, it normalized collateral damage. You know what collateral damage is? You drop a bomb and innocent people die. The mob in that room knew their bomb would destroy reputations, humiliate a family, scar two kids, but they did the math, politically, collateral damage was worth it. So they unleased public accusations leaking two accomplices, something Feinstein could n't quite deny with conviction, because in the end the Ford letter went from Feinstein to the media. Feinstein does n't know how this happened. How could it? She investigate right there on camera. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1UNINDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : Can you tell us that your staff did not leak it? SEN. DIANNE Feinstein( D), CALIFORNIA : Oh, I do n't believe my staff would leak it. I have not asked that question directly. @1UNINDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : Do you know that? I mean, how in the world did that get in the hand of the press? @1FEINSTEIN@2 : The answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your staff? @1FEINSTEIN@2 : I just did. Pardon me? Well, Jennifer reminds me I 've asked her before about it. @1UNINDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : Well, somebody leaked it if it was n't you. @1FEINSTEIN@2 : Well, it was -- I 'm telling you, it was not -- I did not. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1GUTFELD@2 : Oh, how embarrassing. Call it a mystery. Call it substantiation ion. But for sure it was a miracle one created -- one that created a hell no one would want to endure. Happily for Feinstein and friends the target still entered the coliseum. This is way bigger than he said-she said. This is, we said. Due process replaced by political vigilantes. Presumption of innocence be damned. Yesterday, we saw a mob seeking payback tribalism trumping institution and common sense. A female victim gets used. A wife, mother and daughter are wounded, perhaps permanently. America gets sick, while Feinstein holds a pitch fork and says, who me? @1RIVERA@2 : Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know? This was so manufactured. It 's where Alyssa Milano was sitting to -- I think directly to -- over Kavanaugh 's shoulder. She was the guest of Feinstein. And so she was smiling and texting. It was like why was she there. That was orchestrated. This was a show trial. @1RIVERA@2 : A show trial that had the intended effect. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. @1RIVERA@2 : Look where we are today. You have a situation where -- when he came back, when Kavanaugh came back off the ropes, someone talked to him at lunch time after Dr. Ford 's testimony and said, listen, dude, you want this job, you get out there and fight for this job. He got up using the boxing analogy, he went back out there and he swung and he did it. He had the momentum. He got back on top. He was heading towards -- cruising towards that nomination, and then Jeff Flake happened. And I 'm a University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And for anyone as a former activist and attorney myself, if you think that those noisy demonstrators have no impact other than making a nuisance of themselves, you should talk to the two ladies who confronted Jeff Flake in that elevator. They made history. They made him -- he does n't seem like the strongest rod in the shed anyway. He collapsed. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1RIVERA@2 : He collapsed and then they had no choice. They have no choice. @1GUTFELD@2 : Lindsey Graham said it did n't come -- the leak came from Feinstein. Should n't there be an investigation? @1WATTERS@2 : Well, I think the prosecutor, yesterday, did a really nice job of establishing the chain of custody for this letter. She said it 's either for personally, and she gave it to the congresswoman, the Democrat, and then it went to Feinstein. Those were the only three people that had custody of it. The leak must have come from them. And if you look at this woman, Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, believable, personally, but she 's incredibly naive. She 's an academic. She seemed a little out of it at times. And she has been manipulated by the senate Democrats and the judiciary committee and by her lawyers. And the prosecutor did an excellent job explaining that. And here 's how, the whole flying thing, afraid of flying that was manufactured. They 've showed that she goes to Hawaii. She goes all over the country. She had just flown back and forth across the east and west coast. And that was a lie. It was also establish that she never even heard the invitation to come interview her on the west coast, her lawyers were keeping that from her. @1GUTFELD@2 : That was not a lie. I mean, is n't that against -- could n't the lawyers be in trouble for withholding? @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : I mean, you do n't have to tell your client everything. Geraldo would know more. But it seems like she had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bizarre. They did on the same day she has gone to her mother 's funeral. And they wo n't release any of the audio and the video from the polygraph. And sex crime prosecutor, again, made a great point at the very end in closing and said this is not how you treat a true victim of sexual assault. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : Forensic interview. And you do n't polygraph her up and lawyer up, and then parade her out on national television. These people, like you 've said on the monologue, like watching Ford being tortured. Like watching Kavanaugh being tortured. It was sadistic what they did. @1RIVERA@2 : It was all of those things, but it was also premeditated. @1WATTERS@2 : Yeah. @1RIVERA@2 : You do n't have to be guessing around. The Democrats I come back to this point. The Democrats represent the pro-choice forces in this country. They were holding the weak hand. The pro-life forces represented by the Republicans holding the stronger hand. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They get the golden ticket. The golden ticket in the form of the Dr. Ford accusations. How are we going to use this to the best effect? We 're going to hold it. We 're going to hold it. We 're going to look like we 're losing. There, what about this? @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : When this first came up, no, we 're holding a vote on Monday. We 're not extending. It 's a Thursday for a hearing. That 's -- we 're not playing games. If he had done that, it would have avoided this delay, and it would not have jeopardized this vote. JEDEDIAH BILA, CO-HOST : It 's important that -- @5CROSSTALK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : Do you think he could have played that that way, or do you think he would have suffered? KATIE PAVLICH, CO-HOST : I think he would have suffered. Republicans would have looked like they 're not willing to hear from women about sexual assault, which is a playbook that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO-HOST : Agreed. @1PAVLICH@2 : They 've been using it in political campaigns -- midterm, presidential -- for years. That would have not been, optically, a good look. Now, the consequences of that are where we are today. @1WATTERS@2 : Right. It 's all risk now. @1PAVLICH@2 : One thing I want to say about Dianne Feinstein dropping this bomb into the middle of the committee, her staff and Senator Grassley 's staff used to actually have a pretty good relationship. They used to have a really professional working relationship -- @1RIVERA@2 : Not when it comes to abortion. @1PAVLICH@2 : -- on very important, big issues like protesting whistle blowers, national security, oversight of government agencies. And she has completely destroyed any kind of relationship that they had in the past as the left continues to lecture the right about civility and coming together and Washington working to make sure we 're bettering the country. She destroyed that relationship. It was a good one. And she has a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be an investigation about -- GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST : Is Feinstein doing this because she 's trouble, too, with the left in California? @1PAVLICH@2 : Maybe. @1RIVERA@2 : Maybe. But I think that this is big. You have to go back to this. I was a young lawyer when Roe v. Wade was argued and passed. This was a sea change. This was an incredibly profound -- women in the streets. The first lap of the women 's movement was happening, unfolding. The nation was beginning to fracture along these lines. This is the generation later. The pro-life force has finally had an opportunity to -- to sway things back their way, a generation later. And this is the fight to the finish. This is any means necessary. This is -- @1BILA@2 : But if you can acknowledge that, if you can say this is -- this is political. This is about abortion, then ca n't you see that, no matter how many investigations you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @1RIVERA@2 : Yes. I agree. @1BILA@2 : So you ca n't just keep calling for investigations of uncorroborated claims. Because this is political. And Kavanaugh said it was political, which they hate him for. @1WATTERS@2 : Yes, he said it was revenge for the Hillary loss. @1BILA@2 : Right. He was willing to come out and say this was about politics. @1RIVERA@2 : Or Merrick Garland. Is n't this Merrick Garland? Is n't Merrick Garland justification enough? @1PAVLICH@2 : Merrick Garland was never falsely accused of gang raping women at a high school party. @1RIVERA@2 : He did n't even get a hearing. He did n't get a chance to get accused of anything. @1PAVLICH@2 : -- never accused of these types of salacious claims. @1RIVERA@2 : They played -- they played dirty with Merrick Garland. Now what goes around comes around. @1PAVLICH@2 : Not like this. @1GUTFELD@2 : I do n't see -- I do n't think that you could actually predict or say that with this Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's a game in itself. I do n't think that it 's under threat, Geraldo. @1RIVERA@2 : I do. I do. I 'll tell you very easily, very quickly. Roe v. Wade said there 's a competing interest : mother and unborn child. At some point, the child becomes viable. When the child can live outside the mother, the child now has the rights of a human. That date gets -- keeps getting pushed back. Six months, five months, four months into the pregnancy now -- @1PAVLICH@2 : That 's good. The majority of women actually support that. @1RIVERA@2 : That 's where the fight will be. They 're going to -- the technology, they 'll use technology. @1GUTFELD@2 : A sonogram showing that a baby 's a real thing. @1BILA@2 : The message we 're giving is that you can derail a nomination if you do n't like the policy, and it 's being allowed. It 's being tolerated. @1GUTFELD@2 : All right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it? @1WATTERS@2 : You can go ahead. @1GUTFELD@2 : All right. Liberals lashing out against Kavanaugh. Some of the most outrageous bashing of Trump 's Supreme Court nominee, that 's ahead. @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1RIVERA@2 : They are whacking the hell out of the poor guy. Brett Kavanaugh getting smeared by the left. Kicking into high gear. His dramatic, emotional testimony. Watch. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 SEN. DIANNE WEINSTEIN( D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE : This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. @1DON-LEMON-CNN-ANCHO@3 : You could do these other things and still get good grades, still have a great job. That 's why they call people functioning alcoholics. I 'm not saying that he was, but there is a term. There are functioning addicts. SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE( D-RI), JUDICIAL COMMITTEE : Kavanaugh dodged and dissembled, ranted and raved, filibustered and prevaricated. I did not find him credible. @1UNIDENTIFIED-FEMALE@2 : All of a sudden, his anger was triggered. And what we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman. It 's very frightening. @1JEFFREY-TOOBIN-CNN-@3 : We then heard from a belligerent, angry, enraged Brett Kavanaugh, challenging lawyers -- challenging United States senators about how much they drink. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1RIVERA@2 : How 's the guy going to win with that kind of attitude? Perhaps never in the history of high school yearbooks has any ever been probed as intensely with such skepticism as the yearbook of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Democrats have worked to paint him as the prep school version of John Belushi in " Animal House. " @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1WHITEHOUSE@2 : Let 's look at " Beach Week Ralph Club Biggest Contributor. " What does the word " ralph " mean in that? @1BRETT-KAVANAUGH-SUP@3 : That probably refers to throwing up. @1WHITEHOUSE@2 : Judge, " Have you have " -- I do n't know if it 's " buffed " or " boofed " -- how do you pronounce that? @1KAVANAUGH@2 : That refers to flatulence. We were 16. @1WHITEHOUSE@2 : Devil 's Triangle? @1KAVANAUGH@2 : Drinking game. @1WHITEHOUSE@2 : How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1RIVERA@2 : And the other one, the F-F-F-F -- @1BILA@2 : Come on. @1RIVERA@2 : -- you know, just the -- I think that -- Jedediah, did you ever have a yearbook? @1BILA@2 : I did have a yearbook. @1RIVERA@2 : I bet you were, like, the belle of your yearbook. Were n't you? @1BILA@2 : No, I was very shy. @1RIVERA@2 : Yes. @1BILA@2 : I was very -- there was probably nothing in it, to be honest. But maybe there is. @1RIVERA@2 : Does it creep you out that here, a yearbook of all things. I ca n't imagine. @1BILA@2 : Yes. @1RIVERA@2 : I used to put, like, " doll " with a big-D-O-L-L. @1BILA@2 : That was the moment -- @1PAVLICH@2 : Sexist. You 're never getting on the Supreme Court. @1RIVERA@2 : Never. @1BILA@2 : That was the moment, when I saw them bring that yearbook out and start doing that, that 's when I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was insanity of the highest level. And he 's having to explain things he wrote 36 years ago. And I kept thinking at that time that we had yearbooks back then. We did n't have social media and all that. I ca n't wait for Twitter, Facebook. @1GUTFELD@2 : So true. @1BILA@2 : It 's going to be uncovered, all the photos you liked. @1GUTFELD@2 : Don Lemon at New Year 's Eve. @1PAVLICH@2 : Yes. @1GUTFELD@2 : When he was wasted. @1WATTERS@2 : Functioning alcoholic. @1GUTFELD@2 : Functioning alcoholic. @1RIVERA@2 : You get my point about, if he literally lied about one of these little things, you have this -- this principle in the law. False in one, false in all. You know -- I 'm just saying, you 're going to have the most ferocious advocacy on the -- and partisanship on the other side. They 're going to insist. They 're going to go through every note in his yearbook, and they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This will be the week from hell for Brett Kavanaugh. @1WATTERS@2 : Yes. I think last week was the week from hell. And if you can go through your yearbook, fine. I think he 's clean on the yearbook. I 'm not going to bring it up. I 'm just going to point people to this article. This is a Real Clear Investigations article. " Suppressed Blasey Ford Yearbooks " -- Ford 's yearbooks -- " Reveal Fast Times at Holton Arms. " Now, I 'm not going to read what 's in here. @1PAVLICH@2 : Oh, I will. @1WATTERS@2 : Her yearbook is probably, according to this article -- I have n't, you know, obviously confirmed it -- according to this investigative article, a lot worse than his -- his yearbook. @1RIVERA@2 : Meaning like what? @1WATTERS@2 : It 's just -- @1RIVERA@2 : Do n't tease it like that. Like what does it say? @1WATTERS@2 : She -- he may be, you know, talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot worse. I 'll put it like that. @1GUTFELD@2 : I do n't know if it 's her. Is n't it just the yearbook? @1WATTERS@2 : No, no, no. She 's pictured ; she 's referenced. Listen, I 'm not going to bring it up. I 'm just going to say, if you want to look at it, look at it online. Here 's the other thing I just want to also say. A lot of these things -- and I believe Ford -- we all have to remember the Rolling Stone rape hoax - - @1PAVLICH@2 : Yes. @1WATTERS@2 : -- the Duke lacrosse rape hoax, the Tawana Brawley situation. And Senator Chuck Schumer himself was a victim of a phony sexual harassment allegation that he had to then give over to the Capitol Hill police. These things happen -- @1RIVERA@2 : These things happen -- @1WATTERS@2 : -- all the time. And to say that they do n't is a lie. @1RIVERA@2 : The one thing -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing that you have not addressed is, as of 2 p.m. yesterday, there was a 90 percent chance that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice. Do you agree that it 's now a 50 percent chance? @1WATTERS@2 : No, I saw her testify, and I thought she was unbelievable. And I thought, " I do n't think he 's going to be able to do it. " @1GUTFELD@2 : You mean believable? @1WATTERS@2 : Exactly. The way Trump says it : " That was unbelievable! " And then -- then he comes out back against the wall, fight or flight. And I thought he hit a grand slam. And that emotion was real, and it was convincing. But I think you 're right ; now it 's in the no man 's land. @1RIVERA@2 : Are you worried, Katie? @1PAVLICH@2 : I 'm concerned about the timeline. @1RIVERA@2 : He just said I do n't( UNINTELLIGIBLE) @1PAVLICH@2 : But I want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Whitehouse, United States senator, sitting in a Supreme Court nomination, asking someone to define flatulence SIC and terms from a yearbook that was -- @1RIVERA@2 : And ralphing. @1PAVLICH@2 : -- printed 36 years ago, because there was nothing else to actually go off in terms of -- go off of in terms of substance. I think Americans watching think that 's really petty. I think this whole thing is going to backfire. There were record numbers of people watching this yesterday. And today Senator Whitehouse went back onto the dais and said he does n't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was telling the truth about the definition of those terms. So now we 're debating the definition of flatulence SIC, what teenage boys are saying in yearbooks, when this is a person who has 300 opinions. Thirteen of them have been passed onto the Supreme Court, which have been used by the Supreme Court. @1RIVERA@2 : You use what you have. @1PAVLICH@2 : George W. Bush -- @1RIVERA@2 : You use what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flew on Air Force One, hand in hand. There is so much more substance to this man, and instead, they 're talking about terms that were written in a yearbook almost -- @1GUTFELD@2 : The -- @1RIVERA@2 : By any means necessary. @1GUTFELD@2 : The thing that is amazing to me was some very top media minds that we saw in that montage pointed to his fury over his family being destroyed and allegations of gang rape and whatnot and his reputation being destroyed. They pointed to his fury over that as proof that he is capable of assault and all of these other horrible things. The moment of his life when he has to defend himself, I think he 's allowed to be angry. I think he is. And could you imagine if he went out there and was the opposite and was incredibly congenial and sat down and -- they would think he was mentally ill. They would go, " There 's something wrong with him! There 's something wrong. " Those hypocrites. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drinks beer. Don Lemon, though -- @1RIVERA@2 : I need a beer right now. Lots more to cover on today 's developments. The breaking details next on " The Five. " @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1BILA@2 : Breaking news all over the place this hour. President Trump ordering the FBI to conduct a one-week supplemental investigation into accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford 's legal team is already pushing back and saying the probe should not be limited in time or scope. And the lawyers for P.J. Smith, one of the people allegedly at the part, say he is willing to cooperate with any investigation. So Greg, you already see here this delay tactic now that 's going to go on and on with Ford 's team, who by the way, half of her team, remember, she hired on the recommendation of Feinstein. @1GUTFELD@2 : No. 1, did Trump know this was coming, which is why he delayed the Rod Rosenstein meeting till next week? Brilliant, I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @1RIVERA@2 : Which one is referring to? @1GUTFELD@2 : Trump. I 've got to say that the -- you know, it could be. Why did n't the Dems just stand on Ford 's confirmation? What were they -- I guess they must have been worried, because what -- if the FBI actually turns up zilch, then Ford 's testimony is kind of forgotten. I mean, this is -- @1WATTERS@2 : They run a risk, too. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes, there 's a risk. @1WATTERS@2 : Because if it comes back clean, what excuse do they have? @1GUTFELD@2 : Nobody 's going to remember Ford. @1RIVERA@2 : How can you get to the truth in a single week? Come on. Let it - - let it go a second week. Let it go a month. @1GUTFELD@2 : Of course. @1RIVERA@2 : Let it go until mid-November. Let it go until we get a majority back in the United States Senate. @1WATTERS@2 : They can say that, Geraldo, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore. @1RIVERA@2 : I just want to -- @1WATTERS@2 : We 've seen through the tactics, and they 're pretty clear. There 's a lot of holes, though, in Ford 's story that we have n't even discussed. The best friend, under penalty of perjury -- @1PAVLICH@2 : Right. @1WATTERS@2 : -- said that " There was no party. I have no idea what you are talking about. " And when your best friend that you go with runs out of a party, a small gathering, and she has no way to get home because she does n't drive, the friend never asks the next day -- @1BILA@2 : Well -- @1WATTERS@2 : -- " How did you get home? What happened? Why did you run out of the party? " @1PAVLICH@2 : Right. Very odd. @1WATTERS@2 : That 's very odd to me. And then when Ford was asked about that, why did she testify and say that, she goes, well, she had some health problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't make a lot of sense to me. @1BILA@2 : Does it matter, though, Katie? Does it matter really? @1PAVLICH@2 : No. @1BILA@2 : Because we 've already proven that if there 's no evidence and no corroboration, you can basically criminalize this guy. @1PAVLICH@2 : Right. @1BILA@2 : Does it matter if the FBI comes back and finds nothing, if the story 's still going to be the same? Republicans do n't care about women ; this guy is guilty no matter what. What can Republicans do? @1PAVLICH@2 : The only thing that -- the only thing that this might change is the way that Joe Manchin votes, the way that Heidi Heitkamp votes, red- state Democrats. I will note that -- @1RIVERA@2 : Lisa Murkowski. @1PAVLICH@2 : -- President Trump is a Republican. @1BILA@2 : Susan Collins. @1RIVERA@2 : Susan Collins. @1PAVLICH@2 : Susan Collins. I will note that President Trump will be in West Virginia this weekend. And I 'm sure that people in West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this. However, for everybody else, Democrats from day one, before Kavanaugh was even nominated, said they would do everything they possibly could to deny this -- this seat to President Trump. Their goal is to delay. That 's exactly what they 're getting. Chuck Schumer is on the record. Debra Katz the attorney in this case is in videos at resistance rallies saying they 're going to do whatever they can. @1WATTERS@2 : Yes. @1PAVLICH@2 : And the other attorney now working on the case also works for Andrew McCabe, who is under federal investigation for lying to the FBI. So here we are. It 's a delay tactic. And Republicans are going to have to decide whether they 're going to hold the line on Thursday. Because as you 've already seen, her attorneys are now putting all these conditions out. And my question is, she now - she gets questioned by the FBI, too. And are they going to ask her for the therapist notes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post or not? Are they going to ask for her yearbooks? Are they going to ask for corroborating evidence? @1RIVERA@2 : Yes, yes, yes, yes. @1PAVLICH@2 : And her attorneys are n't going to turn it over, which again shows that they 're unwilling to cooperate with this. @1BILA@2 : All right. " One More Thing " is coming up next. @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1WATTERS@2 : Time now for " One More Thing " -- Mr. Gutfeld? @1GUTFELD@2 : All right. Tomorrow night you 're going to -- you ca n't miss this show. Saturday, 10 p.m. We 've got Charlie Hurt, Madison Gesiotto, Kat Timpf and Tyrus. And I just want to say, I know a lot of people get really made over the last couple of days. It 's angry. But I think there is one positive thing that we learned. And I think that we 've learned that the nature of memory is a lot different than what we believe it to be. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all flawed. Everybody makes -- everybody has a Brian Williams story, something that they believe happened that may not have. And I think that 's an important thing that people have to explore and people have to -- @1RIVERA@2 : Especially whether you 've been married five times. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. That is true. I would n't know, but you would. @1WATTERS@2 : OK. All right. Well, my mom has never endorsed a book on this show -- @1GUTFELD@2 : Of course. @1WATTERS@2 : -- until Juan wrote one. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. @1WATTERS@2 : And here 's what she said : " We celebrate this man 's book " -- @1RIVERA@2 : Aww. @1WATTERS@2 : " -- and please send my profound congratulations to Juan. " Juan 's got the " What the Hell Do You Have To Lose? " That 's why he 's not here. He 's selling the book hard. @1BILA@2 : It 's a great title. I love it. @1WATTERS@2 : My mom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go. @1RIVERA@2 : That 's so adorable. That 's so -- @1WATTERS@2 : All right. So there 's also video circling around the Internet. It 's of Sheila Jackson Lee handing something to the attorney for Mrs. Ford. Everybody has got a theory. It 's a big conspiracy theory. Well, we found out, one of our producers on Capitol Hill, she was just handing him notes of support from her and her people and her friends and stuff like that. Nothing nefarious or anything like that. So we 're going to put that to rest. Speaking of nefarious, " Watters ' World, " 8 p.m. live, covering the Trump rally. There it is. Also, we have Geraldo. @1RIVERA@2 : When I -- when I moved to Cleveland, you know -- I still have a small place here. When I moved to Cleveland, it was on the understanding that it 's such a short flight that it will be just like, you know, commuting to upstate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had the most miserable -- @1WATTERS@2 : Who flies to the Hamptons from New York? @1GUTFELD@2 : Only Geraldo. @1RIVERA@2 : -- week and a half. I had a helicopter( ph) for 14 years. @1PAVLICH@2 : Oh, OK. @1RIVERA@2 : I was at -- leaving from D.C. to Cleveland. Three times my airplane started taking off and aborted the takeoff. Three times. Then here I am now, and they deplaned us on the tarmac of Reagan National. And then last night coming in, I swear to God, I went to -- first to a Delta flight. They cancelled that. Then I ran a mile to the next terminal to the United flight. That was five hours late. Then I ran back to the American. The American took off, flew from Cleveland halfway to New York, turned around and went back to Cleveland, landed. So I have to run to the original United flight, and I got here at 3 a.m. in the morning. @1WATTERS@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " All right, Katie. @1PAVLICH@2 : So we all know that dogs, sometimes people say they 're very difficult to take care of. But this one actually helps water itself. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @5DOG-DRINKING-OUT-OF-@7 @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1PAVLICH@2 : And we know that bathrooms in New York City are very small. So fighting for space can be difficult. But this dog learned how to turn on the faucet and just drinks its water. So whenever it 's thirsty, it can go in there and just figure it out. The other dog wants to learn how to do it, too. @1WATTERS@2 : I ca n't believe Dana 's dog does n't know how to do that. @1PAVLICH@2 : I do n't think my dog is smart enough to do that. @1WATTERS@2 : Unbelievable. @1PAVLICH@2 : Maybe just too lazy. @1GUTFELD@2 : Dana is not here. @1BILA@2 : All right. Well, my dream has come true. All right? Miami International Airport has started Miami Hound Machine, the therapy dog program where these dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two hour shifts. People afraid of flying. People get nervous. They 're going to be there to kind of help you through it. First five pups are Abbey, Bell, Dash, Donovan and Pico. They 're going to great passengers during peak traveling periods to destress everybody. And these are -- @1GUTFELD@2 : That would n't have helped Geraldo. He just wants a decent plane flight. Dogs are n't going to help. @1WATTERS@2 : Yes. Cocktail. @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. @1RIVERA@2 : I had a cocktail. I want a dog with those little -- you know, those St. Bernards -- @1GUTFELD@2 : Yes. @1RIVERA@2 : They have barrels of little beer. @1WATTERS@2 : Can we have a rule, Greg, for " The Five "? No double dog " One More Things. " One is enough. We do n't need two. @1PAVLICH@2 : -- double dog. @1RIVERA@2 : Dana 's not here. @1WATTERS@2 : Especially when Dana 's not here. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1PAVLICH@2 : Dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only if they have liquor under their seat.
