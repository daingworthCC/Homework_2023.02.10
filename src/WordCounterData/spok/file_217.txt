4124741 @!ANTHONY-MASON# The town is more than one thousand years old and is said to be the inspiration for the mythic Shangri La. @!VINITA-NAIR# Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY. I 'm Vinita Nair. @!ANTHONY-MASON# And I 'm Anthony Mason. Tomorrow night is the Golden Globes. Hollywood 's first major award show. All the big stars will be there. So who 's favorite to take home the gold? @!VINITA-NAIR# Well, we have one of the nation 's leading authorities on the subject. Tom O'Neil joins us from Los Angeles. He is editor of the showbiz awards website goldderby.com. Tom, good morning. @!TOM-O'NEIL-( Editor# Good morning. @!VINITA-NAIR# I always feel like the Golden Globes are different from all the other awards show. Why is that? @!TOM-O'NEIL# Well, Warren Beatty once famously said the Oscars are business but the Globes are fun. And what he meant is that this is the best party in Hollywood every year. It 's the one time when TV and film get together. And they 're really having a good time. Here 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles of champagne drunk in that room as there are stars. @!ANTHONY-MASON# I was going to say, Tom, one of the other big difference is this, the Globes have alcohol, the Oscars do n't, right? @!TOM-O'NEIL# I know. The Globe-- the Oscars need a little bit of booze to lighten it up, do n't you think? @!VINITA-NAIR# So the hosts this year are everybody 's favorite, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. A lot of people were saying Ricky Gervais did a great job. What can we expect from these women this year? @!TOM-O'NEIL# Well, they 're not going to be as edgy as Ricky was. Of course, they 're a lot more safe, but they 're fun and they 're sexy and they 're NBC stars. This is an NBC Show. So they 're locked in for the long haul. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Tom, the-- the Globes used to get some-- some-- be somewhat maligned because people did n't seem to quite know what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years, have n't they? @!TOM-O'NEIL# They have. You know, back in-- back in the old days, you could probably-- but it was alleged you could buy a vote with a good Cartier watch or a trip to Vegas, and there are a lot of assorted stories about all that. But these days, there 's a different kind of influence that goes on. For example, Robert Redford will probably lose tomorrow because he did n't play the game. He did n't do a press conference with them. And so there 's that kind of influence going on. @!VINITA-NAIR# Okay. We could talk about the alcohol and drama all day long. Let 's talk about some of the predictions. Let 's talk about best motion picture drama. Who do you think will win the Globe for this? @!TOM-O'NEIL# this is going to be Gravity 's award. They love blockbusters at the Globes. Avatar won, of course, a few years ago. But at Gold Derby, we have twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of them are going with 12 Years A Slave to win here and to sweep the Oscars but I do n't buy it. it 's Gravity. @!ANTHONY-MASON# What about best actress in a drama, Tom? @!TOM-O'NEIL# that 's going to be Kate Blanchett. she 's destined to win the Oscar. she should win. She will win and she 's going to start her march for victory here. @!VINITA-NAIR# What about Best Actor because it feels like this one is a really tight race based on everything you read? @!TOM-O'NEIL# It is. Matthew McConaughey is probably out front because he 's redefined himself from surfer dude to serious actor. And that counts. Robert Redford probably should win but he 's just not played the game. @!ANTHONY-MASON# The Globes are interesting because they have a second category for best picture. It 's for comedy or mo-- musical. Who do you see winning that? @!TOM-O'NEIL# This is a slam dunk for American Hustle to win here. I kind of like The Wolf of Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could sweep the Oscars. It 's got A-list casts. It 's funny and it 's probably going to sweep the Globes. @!VINITA-NAIR# Is there odds on favorite for best actress in a comedy or musical this year? @!TOM-O'NEIL# Yes. that Amy Adams has to win here because American Hustle is going to win best drama picture. @!ANTHONY-MASON# I heard Amy Adams was just remarkable in that film. What about-- what about best actor in a comedy or Musical, Tom? @!TOM-O'NEIL# Leo DiCaprio has this. It 's the consolation prize for Wolf of Wall Street. Also, he gives the biggest performance of his career here. And though, the best performance, which is a lot more subtle, is really Joaquin Phoenix. @!VINITA-NAIR# So this is-- obviously the award show, it 's not just about movie, it 's also about TV. So I want to ask you what show you think will win in the best drama series? @!TOM-O'NEIL# The Globes love new shows. And House of Cards on Netflix, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never given any love at all to Breaking Bad so a lot of the critics are saying, come on, finally, catch up with the show but, no, this is House of Cards. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Best TV Comedy, Tom? @!TOM-O'NEIL# That 's going to be the only new show nominated. This will be Brooklyn Nine-Nine on the Fox Channel. @!ANTHONY-MASON# And lastly, Tom, I mean, what role do you think the Globes ultimately have? Do they have influence over the Oscars? Do they tend to predict the Oscars? @!TOM-O'NEIL# With uncanny accuracy. Eighty percent of the stars who won Oscars over the past twenty years won previously at the Globes for the same roles. @!VINITA-NAIR# Well, hopefully Robert Redford fares a little better than Tom thinks he will fare in the Golden Globes. @!ANTHONY-MASON# It 's going to be so tight, that category. Tom O'Neil, thanks so much for being with us this morning. @!TOM-O'NEIL# Great, thank you. @!ANTHONY-MASON# And now for a final look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, from Long Island to South Beach, food expert Lee Schrager tells us why he eats at three hundred restaurants a year. I want that job. You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY. Graphics on Screen : On this date 1908 The Grand Canyon is dedicated as a national monument On this date 1935 Amelia Earhart is the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. On this date 1973 MLB approves AL adopting the designated hitter position On this date 2002 The first twenty detainees are transferred to Guantanamo Bay @(ANNOUNCEMENTS) @!VINITA-NAIR# Lee Schrager is the ultimate foodie. He founded two of the country 's top Wine and Food festivals, one here in New York, the other in South Beach, Florida. The Florida festival kicks off on February 20th for its thirteenth year. The four-day star-studded event will feature the best of the culinary world. Lee, good morning. @!LEE-SCHRAGER-( Foun# Good morning. Good to be here. @!VINITA-NAIR# We 're so excited when we look at this meal in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Well, you 're eating some of the favorite food that I discovered on a road trip that I did this past summer-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Mm-Hm. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# --and writing my book Fried &amp; True. And these are just a few of my favorites. This is Michelle Bernstein 's tomato and fatty cheese salad-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Oh, that 's nice. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# --a great fried green tomato. This over here is from my first cookbook and it 's Nigella Lawson 's caramel croissant bread pudding. @!VINITA-NAIR# Hm. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# This over here is a hash brown souffle that is really so easy to make. And when you find out what 's in it, you kind of say, wow, I ca n't imagine it 's going to be good but it 's extraordinary. That 's a tomato pie right there. And this is really probably one of my favorites from Fried &amp; True, Yotam Ottolenghi 's sesame schnitzel. Easy to make-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Say that again. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# A sesame chicken schnitzel. @!ANTHONY-MASON# I love it. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Sesame chicken, can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken that 's been pounded out and breaded? Is that-- @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Not only is a basically but less. @!VINITA-NAIR# Okay. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# So it 's really-- it's-- it 's a very to eat-- very easy to make dish. It is so delicious, the black and white caraway seeds. It 's a caper mayonnaise sauce. @!ANTHONY-MASON# It 's really good. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# It 's easy to make and it happens to be-- it 's, in my mind, the perfect breakfast food for a drizz-- drizzly morning like we 're having right now. @!ANTHONY-MASON# We mentioned this before but you eat in three restaurants a year? @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I do n't know that I eat in three hundred restaurants here. I eat out about three hundred times a year, so not three hundred different restaurants. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Got it. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I have a lot of my favorites. @!ANTHONY-MASON# And all of this is to-- is research. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Research and a lot of weight watchers. @!VINITA-NAIR# But, you know, I read that you said you 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you tend to order the same things at restaurants. So how do you go about picking the restaurants that are going to be in the festival? @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Well, I'm-- I 'm really a simple eater and people always think that, you know, they-- they have to impress me. And I-- I mean, nothing impresses me more than a great simple meal. I mean, certainly I enjoy fine dining and white tablecloth dining and trying all the Michelin restaurants and highly rated restaurants. But to me, you know, a roast chicken, a great burger, if you look at the foods that I do at the festivals whether it 'd be in South Beach or New York, things that are popular, the burger bash, the barbecue event-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Right. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# --or fried chicken event called Chicken Coop, we do a late night dessert party, we do a sushi party. So you really know what I like or you really know what 's my favorite food by looking at the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-- you-- you started out studying at the Culinary Institute but decided you did n't want to be a chef. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I-- I really never wanted to be a chef and I-- I say that I went to the CIA Culinary Institute because at that time, thirty something years ago, you did n't have to take an SAT, and I was definitely afraid of taking SATs, I had a passion for food. So I figured no SATs, cooking, what could be bad, knowing that I never wanted to be a chef. I just wanted to have the knowledge so one day I did something foolish like enter into the restaurant industry that I would have that knowledge. @!VINITA-NAIR# When I hear about someone with your title, I immediately assume he must have been doing this his whole life. But in some ways, I mean, you had an entirely separate career for twenty years and then embarked upon this at-- it sounds like forty. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Actually I went-- I 've always been in the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, in the beginning, bagging food in a Chinese restaurant. I worked in the supermarket. I worked at a hot dog stand. I worked at Swanson. So I really did, you know, work at every-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# You ran room service for a hotel chain. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I-- I did run-- run room service for a hotel chain and then became a food and beverage director for Intercontinental Hotels for twenty years. And it was really in 2000 that I joined Southern Wine &amp; Spirits handling corporate communications for the company, and in that role created the festival. @!VINITA-NAIR# I read that there was a handwritten letter, though. You actually sat down and wrote a letter. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Actually, when I turned forty in 2000, too early to discuss that. @!ANTHONY-MASON# We wo n't go back there. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually wrote a letter to Wayne Chaplin who is the COO of Southern Wine &amp; Spirits and said, hey, you know, I 've about been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit here for another twenty. I 'm looking for challenge, and I have a feeling that I can bring something to Southern Wine &amp; Spirits-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Right. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# --which is the nation 's largest distributor of alcohol. And did n't hear from him for a while and a few months later, he called me and said let 's have breakfast. And a few weeks later, got a call that I was hired and I did n't even know quite why I was hired for. @!ANTHONY-MASON# I love-- I love that both of these festivals, the money goes to charity. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Both of the cha-- festivals, South Beach and New York are not for profits. South Beach benefits the Chaplin School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University. And New York City benefits the Food Bank of New York, which I 'm a board member, and Share Our Strength, a national hunger organization. So hundred percent of net proceeds, Florida 's up to twenty million dollars, and New York just short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dish to get your signature on, we want to ask you if you could share this dish with anyone past or present, who would that person be? @!LEE-SCHRAGER# You know, that 's a tough question. But I have to say after meeting Marci Waldman here this morning who I-- I-- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Marci 's our producer. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I did n't know, is Marci your produ-- I-- I said this is somebody who I want to share this meal with. This is a real foodie and she gets to meet all these cool people who have signed your plates. And Marci really is somebody who really knows food and appreciates fried chicken for breakfast. @!ANTHONY-MASON# It 's a great choice. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# I will tell you that Marci Waldman is my choice. @!VINITA-NAIR# And now that-- and now that you 've picked her, we can pretty much assure you 'll be back on the show. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Well, a very shrewd move. @!VINITA-NAIR# Thank you so much. @!LEE-SCHRAGER# Thank you. @!VINITA-NAIR# And for more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cbsthismorning. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Up next in our Saturday session, nineteen-year-old singing sensation Jake Bugg, the chart topper will perform songs from his new CD. You 're watching CBS THIS MORNING : SATURDAY. @(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
