Ashley Dupre weighs in on the Tiger Woods and Jesse James cheating scandals. A.J. @!HAMMER, HLN HOST : Big news breaking today on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Houston, weve got a big problem. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER : A shocking comeback performance by Whitney Houston caught on tape. @(SINGING) @!SHOWBIZ-TONIGHT-th# Fed up and furious -- Elin Woods, Sandra Bullock, Charlie Sheens wife. Big news today about all their marriage messes as SHOWBIZ TONIGHT dares to ask, who should get divorced first and who will get divorced first? Ashley Dupre on the Tiger and Jesse cheating scandal. The former call girl who brought down New Yorks Governor Eliot Spitzer is naked in " Playboy " and one on one on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER-@1on-camera : As a former escort, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a married man knowing they may be destroying marriages? @!ASHLEY-DUPRE-FORM : Thats a really ballsy question from you. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER : Its the cant-miss, headline-making interview youll see only on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. @!ANNOUNCER : TVs most provocative entertainment news show starts right now. @(MUSIC) @!HAMMER : Hello. Im A.J. Hammer coming to you from New York City. @!BROOKE-ANDERSON-H : Hi there, everyone. Im Brooke Anderson in Hollywood with big news breaking today - Houston has a problem, a big problem. @!SHOWBIZ-TONIGHT-ca# Like so many Whitney Houston fans, Ive been rooting for her to put her drug troubles and Bobby Brown train wreck marriage days behind her once and for all. But today, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT got a hold of the video of her comeback concert performance in England. And when you see and hear this, you will understand why so many people are not only flabbergasted by how Whitney sounded and behaved, but are also seriously concerned. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!ANDERSON-@1voice-o : Whats the sound of a comeback derailing? @(SINGING) @!SHOWBIZ-TONIGHT-ca# Clips posted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly hitting all the right notes in her concert. @!ALICIA-QUARLES-TH : People said she fell flat, that she was late, that she left the stage for long periods of time. And then, the biggest no-no when youre a diva - that she couldnt hit the notes. @!ANDERSON : SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you what really has people talking is Whitneys less-than-perfect rendition of perhaps her most famous song, " I Will Always Love You. " @(SINGING) @!ANDERSON : Remember her powerful 1992 recording? Lets just say Tuesday night sounded a little different. @(SINGING) @!QUARLES : Back in the day, you know, Whitney would go to that note and shed hit it - that note. Last night, it sounded more like - and it just croaked. And I was like, " What happened to Whitney? " @!ANDERSON : Papers and Web sites all over the world are slamming Whitneys performance. " TheSpoof.com " joked it was actually a Whitney impersonator on stage in Birmingham. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Houston, we have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitneys performance to that of another YouTube sensation, a kid on a Taiwanese competition show who sings a very Whitney-esque version of the same song. @(SINGING) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : This young boy from Taiwan may sound more like Whitney Houston than Houston herself. @!ANDERSON : Whitney Houstons U.K. disaster is a definite setback in her comeback effort, an effort she hoped would return her to stardom after her drug problem and her troubled marriage to Bobby Brown. Her comeback album " I Look to You " did debut at number one and since has gone platinum, but the tour has been having problems. @!QUARLES : When she opened her tour in Australia, people were just livid, they wanted their money back. Whitney canceled the first four dates of her European tour and she said she was suffering allergies. Because she is Whitney Houston, people automatically jumped to conclusions. They said, " Oh, my god. Is she back on drugs? Is she hard partying? And she has nt come out and addressed this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just needed to take some time off. " @!ANDERSON : Whitneys much criticized performance in England isnt doing much to stop the chatter about her troubles. But while some critics are bashing Whitneys performance, others did nt seem to mind it so much. @!QUARLES : She actually hits most of her note. You hear people clapping for her. @!ANDERSON : Alicia Quarles of the Associated Press gives Whitney credit for at least trying to sing. @!QUARLES : Shes not like Britney. I mean, shes not going out there lip-synching. Shes actually singing. @!ANDERSON : But we live in an era where people expect perfection in every live singing performance. Thanks for that, Simon. If Whitneys trying to convince people shes truly put the problems of her past behind her, the sad fact is, Houston cant afford to have many more problems. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!HAMMER : Whats going on here? Is Whitney Houston really having a meltdown? Or was this maybe just a little bump in the road? Right now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doctor of psychology. With me in New York is Midwin Charles who is a legal contributor for " In Session " on our sister network truTV. Ive got to say, Midwin, I was very disappointed by - that Whitneys big comeback seems so derailed. But after all the drama that shes been through, people are very quick to think shes fallen off the wagon again. I mean, should we be concerned? @!MIDWIN-CHARLES-LE : I do nt think we should be concerned. I mean, it is unfortunate that this is always going to trail her, the fact that she had this serious bout with drugs and that train wreck of a marriage to Bobby Brown. But I think she is just exhausted. It happens to a lot of singers as you know. Lady Gaga just took a little break. She had exhaustion problems. I think Whitney just needs to chill out, relax a little bit and then come back to the stage. @!HAMMER : Yes. I think she should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment. Her reps do say any accusations of drug use are just ridiculous. You know, 10 years ago, the idea of Whitney getting booed on stage - that would have been just ridiculous. Somebody would laugh at me for even suggesting it. But let me show you a little comparison that I whipped together. Whitney singing " I Will Always Love You " on VH1s " Divas Live " from back in 1999 and from her gig this week in England. Take a look. @(SINGING) @!HAMMER : All right. Now, in complete fairness, Ive got to point out thats just a little part of her two-hour show. But you know, she has been getting slammed since this tour started months ago. Wendy, is this proof that Whitney is not ready to be back on tour just yet? @!DR-WENDY-WALSH-TV : I do nt think it is proving shes not ready. Certainly, there is a difference we know now from recording in the studio and doing a live performance. And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along there, too not just technical with her voice. Im rooting for her to make this comeback and make it work. @!HAMMER : Yes. And a lot of people are rooting for her. Im rooting for her. And thats what really I think makes all these reports really disappointing and the fact they have been going on again since this tour began. There have been reports of people booing and again asking for their money back. Now, like you, I agree she should probably take some time off. The problem is, if she does that, its just going to fuel the rumors and the fire a little more that something is terribly wrong. What she needs to do is get on stage and hit it out of the park. @!CHARLES : I do nt think she can do that. And you know what? Unfortunately for Whitney, given her past history, anything she does is going to be subject to scrutiny. So I think she really needs to really just relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite frankly, that song is a very hard song to sing a good 10, 15 years later. Lets face it - Mariah Carey does nt have the same voice she did 10, 15 years ago. So its possible that shes also just getting a little older. @!HAMMER : Well, then maybe do nt do the song or rearrange it. @!CHARLES : Exactly. @!HAMMER : Because the truth is, if you are paying what people pay to good to a Whitney Houston concert, one of the most successful female singers of all time, you have a right to have certain expectations. I do believe that. @!CHARLES : Agree. Agree. @!HAMMER : All right. I want to move on to another big story breaking today. Mel Gibson split from his girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. Thats the mother of his five-month-old daughter. Now, Mel, you may remember, started dating Oksana soon after he got divorced from his wife of 28 years was made public. That divorce could cost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive got to believe Mel has some serious regrets right about now. @!WALSH : I bet he does, too. This is classic textbook midlife crisis stuff. Im just really sad to know another human being was made in the middle of all this. But I bet Mel is wishing he could turn back the clock right now. Although, fortunately, he has both the Catholic guilt and all those other kids to take care of and enough money to do it all that Im sure everyone will be cared for. But, Mel, what were you thinking? @!HAMMER : He may lose all this money. His movies are nt doing what they once did. And not everybody has forgotten his anti-Semitic rant. Im saying, karma? Maybe? I do nt know. All right. Got to move on to another big story breaking today. Fed up and furious - Tiger Woods wife Elin, Charlie Sheens wife, Brooke, and Sandra Bullock all reportedly just sick and tired of all the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? And who should file first? Wendy Walsh, Midwin Charles, stay right where you are. Were going to talk about that a bit later on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. @!ANDERSON : A new Kate Gosselin family feud exploding today. Kates estranged brother and his wife in court claiming Kates kids are in danger. Oh, my goodness. This is getting ugly. And Ashley Dupre on the Tiger and Jesse cheating scandals. Now, Ashley is the former call girl who brought down New Yorks Governor Eliot Spitzer. @!HAMMER : Yes. And Brooke, now, shes naked in " Playboy " and one on one with me in an explosive interview. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @(on-camera) : " Dear Ashley, my life has been torn apart by what my husband may have done. As a former escort, help me understand how women can reconcile having sex with married men knowing they may be destroying marriages. " What would you say to her? @!DUPRE : First of all, thats a really ballsy question from you. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TONIGHT on HLN news and views.

Hammer in New York. @!HAMMER : So Pam Anderson says all that talk about Kate Gosselin being a total diva on " Dancing with the Stars " - well, she does nt see it. Pam and Kate are competing on this season of " Dancing. " There have been all kinds of reports that Kate is just a nightmare on the show. But Pam tells CNNs Larry King Kate is A-OK. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) PAM @!ANDERSON, ACTRESS : I see her, you know, when were getting our hair and makeup done and we talk about kids. But she has nt really been - shes just been nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Were you surprised at that? P. @!ANDERSON : Everyones having little meltdowns.

P. @!ANDERSON : Yes. @!KING : Do you relate to her at all? P. @!ANDERSON : Well, yes, we do talk about the kids and my schedule is around my kids so Im always say I have to go here. I have to make dinner. And Im going to rehearse here. So thats about it. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ANDERSON : Well, as Kate Gosselin has said, love her, hate her, she brings in the ratings. And I think shes right because " Dancing with the Stars " is kicking some serious butt, giving the one-time king of reality shows, " American Idol, " a run for its money. But what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions and millions of people? SHOWBIZ TONIGHT investigates the obsession with " Dancing with the Stars " and " American Idol. " @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @(voice-over) : Whats the recipe for a hit TV show? It may include borrowing ingredients from the past. Take one part " Dance Fever, " borrow the spirit of competition from " Star Search, " throw in a humorous host and a panel of judges like " The Gong Show, " add a sprinkle of solid gold sequins and top it off with celebrity guests. Sound familiar? Ratings winners " American Idol " and " Dancing with the Stars " seem a lot like retro re-dos of classic TV variety shows. @!NIECY-NASH- " DANCI : I think its one of the shows people wish they could put themselves in the middle of it all. I mean, you know? Who does nt want to know how to dance? @!ANDERSON : Mary Murphy is a veteran TV entertainment journalist. She says the throwback feel of " Idol " and " Dancing with the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MARY-MURPHY-TV-EN : The appeal of these shows applies to multi-generations who grew up on shows like this. Its the same thing. It shifts, forms and here we are in the present. And we have these amazing shows, the most popular shows on television. @!ANDERSON : Murphy says viewers also like having a say on whose dancing days are over. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Lets find out who is safe and who will be going home. @!ANDERSON : And which " Idol " wannabe will sing on for another week. @!RYAN-SEACREST-HOS : Crystal, you are safe. You may take a seat. Congratulations. @!ANDERSON : " American Idols " ratings are down slightly from the beginning of the season. " Dancing with the Stars " has swept up some of those viewers. But both shows are well ahead of the competition in the TV ratings game. So, what do the stars of these shows say is the secret to their success? @!DEREK-HOUGH- " DANC : Guys like to watch because girls are in hot dresses. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!SEACREST : You know, with successful programs, youve got to connect on a universal emotion. I think thats the universal emotion, is that all of us want at some point in our lives to be on stage. @!ANDERSON : So do people tune in as Ryan Seacrest suggested to Larry King to secretly live out their own Hollywood dreams? Is it the joy of watching a talented single mom rocket to fame? @(SINGING) Or, is it seeing celebrities do something out of their comfort zone? Maybe the simple answer is that people have always found dancing and singing entertaining. And it seems they still do. @!SIMON-COWELL-JUDG : Were going to see you next week. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!ANDERSON : OK. So, lets battle it out right here, right now on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT.

Hammer coming to you from New York City. @!ANDERSON : And Im Brooke Anderson in Hollywood with big news breaking today - fed up and furious. @!HAMMER : Furious, indeed, Brooke. Elin Woods, Sandra Bullock, Charlie Sheens wife. There is even more damaging drama today surrounding their marriage messes as SHOWBIZ TONIGHT dares to ask who should get divorced first, who will get divorced first? Explosive reports today that Charlie Sheens wife, Brooke Mueller, is not only furious but shes so fed up after learning of her husbands alleged cheating scandal that she is ready to file divorce papers. And big news breaking today about Tiger Woods wife, Elin Nordegren. Is she divorce shopping? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kids just as Tiger was returning home. With us right now in Hollywood, Wendy Walsh, who is a TV journalist and doctor of psychology. And in New York, Midwin Charles, who is a legal contributor for " In Session " on truTV. All right. So Elin skipped town just as Tiger returned home from the Masters. " People " magazine reporting that she was just fed up. She was just furious that Tiger actually went back to playing golf so soon. Well, late today, we learned that Tiger is going to play again at a tournament in just a couple of weeks in North Carolina. Wendy, off to you first. Im getting the feeling here Elins just had it. @!WALSH : I do nt know if shes just had it. But remember, this is the husband thats under more scrutiny than any husband in America right now. So I really think she should hang in there a bit and let all our eyeballs and TV cameras be on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Elin has plenty of company in the jilted wives club these days. A bombshell report is out there today that Charlie Sheens wife, Brooke is also fed up and furious and ready to pull the plug on her marriage. Now, Midwin, as the attorney we have on retainer here on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT today, I want to get your take on this. If it happened - obviously, this is not good news for Charlie if she files for divorce before he goes on trial for allegedly attacking her. After all, shes been standing by him until now. @!CHARLES : It wont look good, thats for sure. I mean, oftentimes, whenever someone is on trial, it is always great to have that supporting and loving spouse by their side. So if she is to file for divorce before he goes to trial, it may not bode well for him. Its not going to be a very sexy look. @!HAMMER : Well, we did reach out to Brookes attorney today. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife that we havent seen or heard from in some weeks is Sandra Bullock who has been undercover, of course, since her husband Jesse James alleged cheating scandal first broke. And that has us wondering how fed up and furious she still is. I imagine pretty much so. SHOWBIZ TONIGHT now dares to ask, of all of the jilted wives who are fed up and furious, who is going to be the one to divorce first? Is it going to be Tiger Woods wife, Elin Nordegren? Is it going to be Charlie Sheens wife, Brooke Mueller? Or will it be Americas sweetheart, Sandra Bullock? Midwin, right back at you. Who do you think is going to file those divorce papers first? @!CHARLES : I vote for Elin Nordegren. I think she has been through a heck of a lot of humiliation in light of Tigers actions. And I think he put her and her children at risk by having all these relationships with women. And of course, all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened. I think shes on her way to rolling out. @!HAMMER : All right. Elin down from Midwin. Over to you, Wendy, who do you think is going to file those divorce papers first? Are you with Midwin here? @!WALSH : Actually, no. I think Sandra. Shes got the most power. Shes got the most financial power. Shes got the most social power, celebrity power. There are no children involved in this particular union. I mean, he has his own children, but they did nt make any together. Shell have no problem getting a date and having enough money to provide for herself in the future. Shes going to file, trust me. @!HAMMER : See, I actually think its going to be Brooke Mueller, Charlie Sheens wife, filing first. The reason for that is because of the other two - you know, Elin, for whatever reason, has been dragging it on and on and staying with Tiger Woods despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gotten. I think in Sandra Bullocks case, you know, theyre really going to wait for the dust to settle there. I have a feeling that we may actually see Brooke be the first to file. Of course, as we said, that could be really bad news for Charlie. So now that you voted on who will divorce first, I actually have to ask you on the other foot who should file the divorce papers first, who should just get it out and do it now. Midwin, back to you. Who, in your mind, should file those papers? @!CHARLES : Once again I vote for Elin Nordegren. She should have filed for divorce almost as soon as those girls started coming out of the woodwork. She should have been out of there. And Im sorry, I do nt buy the fact they have two children as the reason as to why she should stick around any longer. He s a golfer. He has to play golf in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably put himself in situations to continue cheating. @!HAMMER : He does nt have to keep playing golf because he does nt have to keep making money. See, I do nt think its the money that motivates him anymore. People keep talking about the money thing - and Midwin, I do nt know if you disagree with me on that. I actually think he does it because this is what he s always done. At this point, does he really need more money? I mean, seriously. Wendy, what about you? Do you think that it should be Tiger Woods or Elin Nordegren filing for divorce first? @!WALSH : Well, disagree with my colleague, Midwin. I think when there are children involved, a lot of different decisions, more higher level thinking, have to take place because they are far more important. And children from two-parent families do a whole lot better. But you know who should? Brooke and Charlie. Because Im old enough to remember that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam, Heidi Fleiss. So the best way to predict somebodys future behavior is their past behavior. There are allegations of domestic violence - @!HAMMER : Yes. @!WALSH : Drug use, frequent, you know, sexual activity. All this stuff is bad, bad, bad and does nt bode well for a healthy marriage. So Brooke, boot him out. @!HAMMER : And the truth is if there is domestic violence that actually took place as is alleged, you know, thats a game closer right there as far as Im concerned. @!WALSH : Right there. @!HAMMER : Speaking of fed up and furious, Kate Gosselin just furious that her brother just testified against her at a hearing to investigate if any child labor laws were broken during the filming of " Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8. " Watch what she told HLNs own Joy Behar about this. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!KATE-GOSSELIN-REA : My brother has made a lot of money off of saying things that are untrue about us. And he has not - Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Im not quite sure what information they think that they might have. But I cant - every single time they were visiting, my kids, they would turn around and be on some sort of a show the next day talking about, you know, what it is that they saw inside our house. And so, with that kind of trust ruined and knowing that they have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on lies about us, Im not sure what their goals are, because they were a part of our show and things were all fine and dandy then. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER : All right. Ive got to tell you there are a lot of people out there who are pretty sick and tired of Kate getting dumped on constantly. And theyre not letting her move forward. I mean, I am the first to admit I was pretty tough on her when she had " Jon and Kate Plus 8 " on the air, putting the kids on television. I never thought that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think now, shes making money. Shes taking care of the family. People should really leave her alone and not be so hard on her? @!CHARLES : I think I agree with you. People should leave her alone. But every time you try to, she is out there whining and complaining about her lot in life. I watch " Dancing with the Stars " and at the end of every episode, shes always whining and complaining about media scrutiny and the paparazzi. @!HAMMER : Yes. @!CHARLES : So she keeps injecting herself into the situation. So of course, she is not going to be left alone. @!HAMMER : Quickly, Wendy, do you think the smartest thing for her to do is keep raking in the money but keep your mouth closed at this point? @!WALSH : You know, the entertainment industry is one of the few industries where you can make a lot of money in a short period of time. When youre a single mother and you have eight kids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, complain about the barking, but she did nt call on the dogs. @!HAMMER : All right. Wendy Walsh, Midwin Charles, thanks, guys. We appreciate it. As we move on tonight " South Park " just opened a big old can of controversy in its latest episode. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Excuse me.

They all came back to " South Park. " And this time, they came back with a vengeance and a class-action lawsuit. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : There is one thing that your town could do to maybe make me forget about this lawsuit. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Anything. Anything you want, Mr. Cruise. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Its just that theres somebody Ive always wanted to meet face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town - @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Sure, who is it? We can get anybody for you. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Mohammed, the prophet of the Muslim faith. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Oh, thats tricky. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could try to bring in town. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : No, just him. You get Mohammed to appear in " South Park " or your little town is done. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ANDERSON : " South Park " even reviving one of its biggest controversies ever - they made fun of the Muslim prophet Mohammed again, but also skewered other religions, too, including Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism. @!HAMMER : Right now, Ashley Dupres explosive sex scandal advice for Sandra Bullock and Elin Woods. And its the interview seen only on SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. Now, Dupre is the former call girl whose hook-ups with Eliot Spitzer led to him resigning as the governor of New York two years ago. Dupre has just posed naked for the brand-new issue of " Playboy " magazine. And now, shes also giving out sex and romance advice as a columnist for the " New York Post. " So since Ashley knows all about earth-shattering sex scandals, of course, I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra. And thats when the fireworks started. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @(on-camera) : Youre writing your sex and relationship column for the " New York Post. " @!DUPRE : I am. @!HAMMER : Thats going well for you? @!DUPRE : Going very well. Im really excited. And Im getting a lot of interesting questions. And I really hope that - to have that develop and grow. @!HAMMER : Well, speaking of interesting questions, just curious if you were to get a letter from Sandra Bullock, you might be able to provide some insight. Let me read what perhaps she might write to you if she were to write. " Dear Ashley, my life has been torn apart by what my husband may have done. As a former escort, help me understand how women can reconcile having sex with married men knowing they may be destroying marriages. " What would you say to her? @!DUPRE : Well, you know, first of all, thats a really ballsy question from you. But I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy. And if she really loves him, then they can make the relationship work. But they need to good to therapy and they need to see if theyre able - if shes able to forgive him. You know, if every time a phone rings or a text message comes through, if shes going to feel insecure, its not good for her. @!HAMMER : Cant possibly work. @!DUPRE : No, walk away, leave. I mean, shes beautiful. Shes gorgeous. Like she does nt deserve that. @!HAMMER : OK. Heres another one. What if you got this letter from Tiger Woods wife Elin? @!DUPRE : Oh, my god. Im here to talk about " Playboy, " not this. Lets go - come on. My issue is coming out on Friday the 16th and you have me in the hot seat talking about all the scandals. And oh, my god. @!HAMMER : And we will circle back to this. But I like - I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Tiger Woods wife, Elin, wrote you saying, " Dear Ashley, my husband may have paid many women to have sex with him. I do nt understand why he did this but he says he wants to stay together. Do you think I should forgive him? " @!DUPRE : I believe we do nt know the situation. We do nt know what theyre going through. We do nt know what kind of therapy theyre getting. And you know, they are going to figure it out. @!HAMMER : Is forgiveness possible? @!DUPRE : It depends. @!HAMMER : Sure. @!DUPRE : It depends on the situation. @!HAMMER : Sure. @!DUPRE : Absolutely depends on the situation. @!HAMMER : I agree with that. When you look at - @!DUPRE : And you know what, Im not Elin. And Im not Tiger. @!HAMMER : Understood. But just stepping back because certainly, everybodys been talking about this. And people have said and certainly weve seen people say, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple indiscretions, they work it out. Theyre able to move on. " You know, he has allegedly been involved with so many women. @!HAMMER : But think about it - hold on a minute, A.J. Come on. Lets back it up a little bit. Lets look at, OK, guys that cheat. If they get caught with that one girl, they get caught with one girl. But how many girls were there before that one girl? Chances are they are not just cheating on - with one girl. Theres always more. So forget about the number. If their relationship - if they can make it work and they love each other and they go to therapy, then work it out. But if not, its not healthy for the children. Go to therapy and figure out how youre going to come together and raise the children together as a family. @!HAMMER : When you look at Sandras situation and when you look at Elins situation, who do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt - I feel sorry for both of them. They are publicly humiliated. I mean, my situation was completely different. But I did nt ask for this, OK. I was pretty much, " Here you go. Figure it out. " Put in this situation. And you know what? Two years - Ive spent two years trying to figure it out. And Im not giving up fighting for who I am rather than what people think I am and I wont stop fighting. @!HAMMER : Well, you shouldnt. @!DUPRE : No. And Im not going to. @!HAMMER : Because life will continue @(CROSS-TALK) @!DUPRE : And I refuse to let my mistakes define me as a person. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HAMMER : Well, Ashley calls her life now a work in progress.
