4172241 CONTENT : TEIGEN, BURIED, MARRIAGE, BABY So welcome back. Chrissy Teigen just admitted that before she did in vitro fertilization, she chose the sex of her baby, saying she loved the thought of her husband, - John Legend, having a daughter. And people got very freaked out that she could do something, ' cause she had several embryos and she chose the girl embryo because they know, they can tell now, because that 's what science has done. But some people are concerned because they feel it 's, the next step is choosing... Well, it 's a slippery slope to designer babies. That 's what everybody is afraid of, that everybody is gon na pick a baby that has the coloring that they like, and you 'll have, you know, people are just gon na pick blonde babies with blue eyes. Not black people. I do n't think so. And every kid 's gon na look like the " Village of the Damned. " Did you ever seen that movie? Honestly, honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember, I remember hearing about designer babies a little while ago, like in the early 2000s. And I really thought about it. Yes, I was young, but I thought about it. I know I have diabetes in my family. If you know you have breast cancer in your family, if you know you have these illnesses in your family... Right.... as a mother, that I 'm not, what would I do to help the child have the best future they can have. that 's genetic testing. They have that already. They have genetic testing, but, I mean, if you have, but I understand like diabetes, yeah. Wait, she 's talking about something else. She 's talking about... What are you talking about? Go ahead, finish. They do n't want me to talk, go ahead. No, please finish. If I could design the embryo to where I can get that gene out, if I can help that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. I would n't really mess with the eyes or, you know, mess with the hair color or anything of that nature because you do n't know what 's gon na happen and you do n't know the reverse effects of it. But I 'm gon na try my best to do something to prevent those illnesses the best I can. And because that 's where we are in this generation. That 's how I feel. That 's a good intention, but like, when you start, I mean, you talk about a slippery slope and where do you draw the line between what color eyes do they have. that right there, you know, that 's a noble, that 's definitely a good reason to, to, to do... Were n't they aborting all the girls in China for several generations? No, no. They sold them. They, if you had a... They were aborting them, too.... if you, if you, well, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had, but I do know that they would abandon them on the side of the road, which they 've outlawed, finally. But, but, I, I, you know, I just, people have their needs for their reasons and whatever reasons they have for the child that they want. Now, I do n't think everybody is gon na make blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies ' cause... No.... you know, I do n't think I would. I... I, I did n't say you would. A lot of people would, though, Yeah, but I, you know, there 's a lot of Asian folks, there 's a lot of black people, there 's, and I do n't think we would. I know. that 's a sad statement, Joy. I do n't think they... It 's a sad statement, but it 's, it 's... I do n't think it 's truthful. When, when, when you read all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life and beautiful people in this country are... But blonde does n't always equal beautiful. Well, we 're working on it. We 're working on it. But it 's still out there, a lot of it. Look at the magazines. Skinny, you know what I mean? I have to say this. Remember, remember, remember the big boom of everybody being orange, remember, ' cause everybody wanted spray tans and they wanted to dye their hair. Like, there is this, oh, it was huge. It was, people were... Where have I been? I do n't remember that. People wanted to be orange? Are you serious? That 's hilarious. No, it was like ' cause people 's spray tans were getting out of control. Oh, I see. And everybody was orange, especially in Cali. Anyway, I feel like it 's not, it does n't portray exactly what we 're used to seeing as beauty. People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You 're seeing it more and more. It 's a change. Yeah, we 're working on it. There 's a change. Well, and, and also, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you know. You, what is beautiful in a magazine is not necessarily beautiful to other people. But I also, go ahead, baby. Just to go back to your point. I mean, I, I was blessed to be able to conceive children. I did n't have a problem to have that, so I understand that 's a huge struggle for many women that can and go to find in vitro. But I did n't find out the sex of my babies, for any of them. ' Cause that 's one of the last really big surprises left in life. And I wanted to be surprised. But even to your point that you were making, I did n't even want any of the genetic testing ' cause if I knew there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby in any case. Anyway. You were young, I mean, but you were young, too. But I would, I hold that decision today, too. No. But I 'm just saying, like, when, the older you are, you 're almost, they, they almost require you. I know with my last, I was 37 and they asked if I wanted genetic testing. Yes, yes. No, you can do that. But I 'm saying the point is I, you know, I, I feel that God gives life... Exactly.... and no matter what the circumstances, you would provide the best care for your baby no matter how they 're born, no matter what handicaps they have. As less, as long, as long as you can. As long as you can afford it. And that 's really important to keep in mind, you know, ' cause people do horrible things to just, horrible stuff. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best start we can. But we also want the parents of the child to also have the best that they can and be, you know, forthright. Anyway, Chrissy, congratulations, you 're having a baby. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and by the way... You look so pretty. She looks awesome. Well, yeah, and this, even if she put on 9,000 pounds, she 'd still look like Chrissy Teigen, okay? So that 's a good thing. We 'll be right back. The " View " would like to thank Apple and Eve for providing our entire studio audience with a bottle of their 100 percent pure juice. Oh, hey, we got a lot more " Hot Topics " coming up. See, check it out. Come on back now. So welcome back. A woman wrote to an online advice column, Dear Prudence, because she 's conflicted about which husband to be buried next to. Ten years ago her first husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravesite. But now she 's happily remarried with kids and maybe wants to be buried beside her current husband. How would you handle this? I would wait until the in-laws pass away and then make the, no. I 'm, but she has kids now. I would want to be buried next to my husband and my kids. I would eBay that and get that money back and go lay next to who I want to lay next to while I 'm gone. there 's only one solution. Cremation. Yes, I agree. Cremation, and spread my ashes over Liam Neeson. I want cremation. They spent a lot of money though. To cremate? No, no, no. They spent a lot of money on the thing. you 'd have to, she should explain to the folks and say thank you so much, you know, and give them the money back. Yes. And see maybe what, you know, maybe they, they want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, where is the, that person 's family member that could be, you know, if he has a sister that has n't died yet or a, a, has a family member. Or maybe they wan na be next to him. I mean, it 's, you know, I always get... It 's a big decision. It is a huge decision. I say put me in the microwave, let me go. We 'll, we 'll do that. Yeah, that 's what I do. Okay. So tune in to " Consent On Campus, " which is a " Nightline " event, apparently, tonight at 12:35 Eastern, right here on ABC, for an eye-opening look about what 's really going on on college campuses right now. Yeah. There 's a lot going on on college campuses. I, I see time left. But it, you know. There 's, yeah, it 's kind of crazy. A little confusing, right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So go ahead. But you know, do you think that one of the things that makes relationships really disappear, when you know it 's done... Yeah?... is that you 're really, like, fed up. There 's a word for it. What do they call it? Contempt. Contempt. When you just have contempt for that person. Yeah, it 's like quiet. And is that, is that when you know it 's really over? It 's like quietly hating the person. Yes. It 's more, it 's more, you know, worse. It 's more vile than, like, arguing in a way ' cause there 's still heat, but there 's like this quiet hatred. So it 's, it 's worse than resentment ' cause resentment and bitterness can build and then you have contempt and then it 's just over. Then it 's over. Why, well, well, wait, when you get, when you get resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? That 's the question. Not, should n't you have a conversation about it? ' Cause it 's slow. It 's a slow build( inaudible). I ask all married people that. I 'm so quick to say goodbye. As soon as I 'm angry, but then, again, I 'm not married. I do n't have kids and I know that divorce is expensive. Right. There are children involved. There are, well... So you let the resentment build. But let me tell you something about kids. Kids feel that resentment. Kids know. I 've had situations where my friends were like, I wish my parents would get divorced already because it 's an unhealthy environment. Do n't always blame it on us that you 're staying in a sad situation. You need to help us out, too. I do n't, I do n't agree with that at all. that kids would rather have you miserable than divorced. I really do. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce. They hate it, hate it, hate it. And that does n't mean you do n't do it. I did it. But they hate it. You did n't do it. You 're here. Well, I, the first time. Yeah. I 'm an advocate for growing within that relationship together. Yes, good luck. We 'll be right back. That 's right. They 're two of Hollywood 's most wanted men. Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton hit the table, next.
