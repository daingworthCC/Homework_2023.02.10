237741 ANNOUNCER : Welcome to Larry King Live. Tonight : Do we really know what 's going on behind closed doors? Sex in America. Plus : She 's called ' Bambi. ' Is she an innocent victim or a cold-blooded killer? And is the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle finally solved? Now, here 's Larry King. LARRY KING : Good evening and welcome to another edition of Larry King Live. By the way, on Monday night we 're going to really go at it over this proposed budget with both sides of the issue : Congressman Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts ; Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia. That 's Monday night on Larry King Live. Sex surveys in America. The Kinsey Institute has long been regarded as the leading source on sexual practices across the USA, but it has recently come under fire. Charges of fraud, misleading research and sexual perversion have been aimed at the institute. Dr. Judith Reisman is leading that charge with her new book Kinsey, Sex and Fraud - there you see its cover. The Kinsey Institute, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dr. Reisman, stating, and we quote, ' We do not wish to dignify her work by being on the same show with her. ' Joining us, however, from San Francisco is Dr. Ted Mcllvenna. Dr. Mcllvenna says that Dr. Reisman 's charges are completely false. What are you saying, Judith? JUDITH REISMAN, Author, ' Kinsey, Sex and Fraud ' : Well, it 's not just what I 'm saying. It 's what the Kinsey data says. Anybody can go to the library right now and get a copy of the Kinsey Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female and look at pages- I suggest they turn to pages 160 to 161 in the Male volume. They 'll see descriptions of children in convulsions - 196 children - in convulsions - fainting, weeping, striking what Kinsey called ' the partner ' and that was a definition that he gave for ' orgasm. ' And he was talking about these children being sexually stimulated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tables which are on pages 175 - I think - to 185, tables 31, 32, 33, 34- Read them. Look at them and let the American public determine what that is @!KING All right, and what are you saying the Kinsey report is, a false document? Ms. REISMAN : Yes @!KING It is not the correct information? Ms. REISMAN : Oh, no, it is completely misleading. It is manipulative. And worse than that - worse than that, Larry - what we have here is a whole body of information that 's been disseminated to the American public- KING : For years. Ms. REISMAN : -about human sexuality since 1948 - 40-some years - the sexual revolution, which has been based upon people who not only allowed the sexual abuse of 317 infants and children from two months of age to 14 years of age, but then who deny that this is reality, who pretend to the American public that it did n't happen and who attempt then to defame my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American public wo n't accept it because the books are there and they tell the story @!KING In essence, you 're saying - what? - Kinsey lies? Ms. REISMAN : Oh, definitely lies @!KING For what purpose? Ms. REISMAN : Well, all right. The Kinsey folks, or Kinsey himself, had an agenda. He had a- KING : The late Kinsey. Ms. REISMAN : The late Kinsey had an agenda @!KING Which was? Ms. REISMAN : It was a sexual revolution agenda. Kinsey believed - and he made it very clear - that the most important thing we can do is to have what he called ' outlet ' sex. That is that he believed that the ' Judeo-Christian ' ideas of human sexuality - monogamy, fidelity, male-female relationships, that sort of thing - was sic out the window. He felt that those kinds of relationships were repressing us and causing us then to be sexually unhappy and causing rape to increase and causing sexual abuse to increase. Well, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened @!KING Everyone I 've ever interviewed from that institute always says that all they do is gather information. They do n't have a philosophy. Ms. REISMAN : Yeah, I know. When I first hit this thing, it was in 1981. I delivered my paper at the fifth annual conference on sexology in Jerusalem. I delivered my paper there and one of the Kinsey people, at the end of the delivery of the paper, stood up and said, ' Look, this is ridiculous. Let 's have tea and talk about it, ' and I said, ' This requires a major investigation by the scientific community. ' And Walter Stewart sp? of the National Institutes of Health agrees completely. He does not think that this is foolish @!KING All right, Dr. Mcllvenna is with us from San Francisco. Let 's introduce him. Dr. Ted Mcllvenna is president of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. You disagree with Judith. Why, doctor? TED McLLVENNA, Sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Alfred Kinsey is gone- and many of us have spent many hard years looking at the validity of those reports. I spent the afternoon with Dr. Wardell Pomeroy sp?, who was the co-author with Kinsey, and just what Judith Reisman said is just flat-out lies. I find that it's- Nobody came to us ; nobody brought it to the sexological scientific community. I do n't know where she 's coming from @!KING What about her description of the practices of abuse of children regarding orgasm? Mr. McLLVENNA : Well, first of all, the children were talked to and were observed. No child was ever - in any situation - was ever touched by an adult. All children were there with parental consent. Dr. Reisman knows this- Ms. REISMAN : Oh, that 's ridiculous- Mr. McLLVENNA : All of this has been checked before. Ms. REISMAN : That 's absolutely ridiculous. It 's a defense of what you know to be untrue. All you need to do is to read what the Kinsey report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself said and that Pomeroy said. Pomeroy- KING : And they said what? Ms. REISMAN : Oh, first of all, Kinsey said that he used nine- that there were nine technically trained men who did this to these children. Look at the one in which you have- KING : Did what to children? Abused them? Ms. REISMAN : And I have a letter from Paul Gebhardt sp? - That was n't true, by the way - I did call and I did write to the Kinsey Institute. Paul Gebhardt sent me a letter and I have a copy of it in our book - a copy of the letter - and one of the things he admitted was that these children were stimulated around the clock and that oral and manual techniques were used on these children @!KING For what purpose? Ms. REISMAN : To find out- for Kinsey to say that they were orgasmic. You see, the main- KING : To show that children had orgasms? Ms. REISMAN : Exactly. The main thing- KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fair- Ms. REISMAN : I would n't show that children have orgasms @!KING You would n't show it? It 's not an important study? Ms. REISMAN : Of course not. We 're not going to stimulate children around the clock, 24 hours, to prove that @!KING All right, then why is it important to even study whether children have orgasms? Mr. McLLVENNA : Kinsey 's job was to study everything that humans do sexually and how they feel about it and he went about it in the most systematic scientific way that was possible at the time. It was well-monitored by all kinds of human-subject research committees. It was carefully evaluated - explained - and I would like everyone to buy Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. They 're very important volumes in the history of sexology. If these claims were true, all of us have been fooled by people that we have a great deal of respect for- Ms. REISMAN : That 's a very good point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the person who 's trying to fool you is Judith Reisman. Now, why are n't these charges made against these very, very fine scientists like Dr. Pomeroy? Ms. REISMAN : I 'm making these charges against Dr. Pomeroy. I think he should be investigated @!KING Wait a minute, if you 've got charges of child abuse- Ms. REISMAN : You bet @!KING -why do n't you go to Indiana and file them? Mr. McLLVENNA : You 'd better substantiate them, lady, instead of this nonsense. Ms. REISMAN : I think that he should be investigated and I 've been saying that there are legal issues here ; that if these charges hold up in the American public that Dr. Pomeroy and other people who 've been involved in this research have violated not only ethics and not only morality and all the rest of that, but actually are involved in actual criminal activity and they can investigate that @!KING And you 're saying, Dr. Reisman, the Kinsey concept was to promote kind of open sex? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KING Rather than a report? Ms. REISMAN : Oh, absolutely @!KING All right, and you 're saying, Ted, it 's reportage, right? Mr. McLLVENNA : Yes @!KING It 's not a philosophy. It's- Mr. McLLVENNA : Dr. Kinsey and his whole background- The man was a chronicler of what people did sexually. He counted orgasms. He looked at what people did. He went about it in the most systematic scientific way possible. Ms. REISMAN : Untrue @!KING Untrue? Ms. REISMAN : Untrue, untrue. Mr. McLLVENNA : All right, she 's saying it 's untrue. I was asked by the church- Ms. REISMAN : The data is completely fraudulent @!KING Wait a minute- Mr. McLLVENNA : I was asked to look into this- KING : You 're saying that Kinsey did not do research? He did not interview people? Ms. REISMAN : No @!KING Interviews were not- Ms. REISMAN : No @!KING He did not? He did none of that? Ms. REISMAN : No, as a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do? Ms. REISMAN : All right, all right, all right. When you look at what he said he did and when you look at what he did do there are two different things. In fact, if you look at the female research and if you look at the male research, the male research, he claims - or Pomeroy claims - was a cross-section of the population. It was n't. If you look at the male research, what you really find is that roughly 25 percent of that population were prison inmates. These were men who were already in prison - most of them, by the way, for sex offenses. Now, if you 're going to use that as your normal male population, yes, you 're going to find a high rate of behavior that does n't apply @!KING Wait a minute. Ted, is that true? Twenty-five percent of the subjects were- Mr. McLLVENNA : Oh, Jesus! This woman- I do n't know where she 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLLVENNA : They looked for men in the prison population because they were looking for a number of men with zero to eight grades of education and 20 percent of the men at that time were in prison with that level of education @!KING I see. Let me get a break- Mr. McLLVENNA : All of these studies, all of this research has been duplicated and checked out and followed up on @!KING All right, I 've got to get a break, guys, and we 'll come back with Dr. Judith Reisman- Ms. REISMAN : You duplicated- KING : -author of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud ; and Dr. Ted Mcllvenna, president of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. We 'll include your phone calls next. Do n't go away. Commercial break KING : Our guests are Dr. Judith Reisman and Dr. Ted Mcllvenna. We 'll include your calls in a moment. One quick question for Dr. Mcllvenna : I 'm looking at Dr. Reisman 's book in which the Kinsey folks, on checking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-year-old who had 26 orgasms in a 24-hour period. What was the purpose of that, doctor? Ms. REISMAN : And how do you do it? Mr. McLLVENNA : First of all, I was not a party at that time. At that time, with parents who brought their children and who were looked at, talked to and observed- There was no stimulation- KING : I understand. What would the purpose be in learning that? Mr. McLLVENNA : Well, I think that- KING : That knowledge then tells us what? Mr. McLLVENNA : -the whole purpose is to look at what everybody does sexually and to observe it and to chronicle it. That 's what Kinsey did @!KING Yes, but I mean the chronicling of- Let 's say that we learn that a four-year-old boy can, let 's say, have an erection and be turned on by a woman. Let 's say we learn that. Now, what? Mr. McLLVENNA : Well, that 's not- First of all, he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, what if we did learn that? So what? I mean, let 's say we learn that children self-stimulate. What do we do with that information? Mr. McLLVENNA : Because it 's important. Some children harm themselves ; feel guilty about it. What we want to know is everything about what people do sexually. Ms. REISMAN : Well, I 'm sorry. That may be true, but Kinsey said that there 's nothing to feel guilty about and what you 're talking about- He said that the men who did this- He said- KING : Wait a minute. What 's wrong with that? Why grow up feeling guilt over sex? Ms. REISMAN : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You 're talking about adults stimulating the children @!KING No, wait a minute- Mr. McLLVENNA : That never happened, lady. That is a lie. It never happened. Ms. REISMAN : Listen, here, here. That 's a phony deal. Mr. McLLVENNA : It never happened. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about- KING : He says adults did n't stimulate them. Mr. McLLVENNA : It did not happen. It 's a lie. Ms. REISMAN : Oh, you have to read the book, then. Mr. McLLVENNA : You 've made this up. Ms. REISMAN : Of course, he admits- Mr. McLLVENNA : You 're making this up- KING : Wait a minute. You 're saying that Kinsey admits that- Ms. REISMAN : Of course, Kinsey admitted it. It 's in the book. Mr. McLLVENNA : It is not @!KING OK, all right. Ms. REISMAN : You know, you do n't read the Kinsey reports. Mr. McLLVENNA : It is not. They were stimulated- KING : OK, let me get a call. Arlington, Virginia, hello. 1st CALLER : Arlington, Virginia Hello, Larry, I love your show @!KING Thank you. 1st CALLER : My question is this. First, I 'd like to say that I think she 's right. There 's an awful lot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's on your show, at this point, my question to him would be : You know, since 1948 we 've had this- KING : What 's your question? 1st CALLER : -series of reports saying that promiscuity - there 's nothing wrong with it. We 're now faced with one of the largest epidemics ever, AIDS and- KING : OK, hold it. Now, Dr. Mcllvenna, let 's get something clear. Did Kinsey promote promiscuity or report promiscuity? Mr. McLLVENNA : He reported what people did sexually and how they feel about it. He never in his life ever told people to go and be promiscuous- KING : Now, that I know- Mr. McLLVENNA : -nor did his colleagues @!KING Ruth, can you- Judith, can you give me a quote anywhere in the Kinsey report in which they said, ' Go out and have sex '? Ms. REISMAN : Oh, gosh, yeah, but you 'd have to- KING : Go ahead. Ms. REISMAN : OK, thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go have sex. ' Ms. REISMAN : OK @!KING All right, we 'll take a caller. Dallas, hello. 2nd CALLER : Dallas, Texas I would like to know why Miss- Judith is approaching this in such a moralistic way instead of a scientific way @!KING In other words, Judith, if we learn, let 's say, that children self-stimulate- Ms. REISMAN : Right @!KING -and we learn that there is early sexual- Let 's say we learn this- Ms. REISMAN : OK @!KING -then growing up with sexual guilt is stupid and Kinsey helped us come awake. Ms. REISMAN : No, no, no, no, Larry- KING : Respond. Ms. REISMAN : Larry, the whole point here is that Kinsey did not teach us anything about children 's self-stimulation. What Kinsey did was he used nine men and that 's in- I have my original book over there. He used nine men. Those nine men were involved in the sexual stimulation of 196 children- Mr. McLLVENNA : They were not. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and not only that, but I can read to you right now- Mr. McLLVENNA : You 've been trying this old turkey for years. It just is n't true. Ms. REISMAN : -the way in which Kinsey described- Kinsey said- hear this- On pages 160 and 161, he said the children responded this way : reading ' With extreme tension, violent convulsions, gasping, eyes staring, mouth distorted, sometimes with tongue protruding, whole bodies- parts of it spasmodically twitching, throbs, jerking of the penis, groaning, sobbing, violent cries, more or less frenzied movement, trembling, pained or frightened- ' And hear what he says. This is important, ' that the child ' - he 's talking about children - ' will fight away from the partner and make violent efforts to avoid climax. ' Now, here, this is the important point. They 're fighting away from this adult who 's stimulating them and he says, ' -although they derive definite pleasure from the situation. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite pleasure? He 's just described convulsions and faintings @!KING All right, if that 's a direct quote, Ted- Ms. REISMAN : It 's a direct quote @!KING -how would you defend it? Mr. McLLVENNA : Well, first of all, it 's not- There were n't any persons stimulating anyone. I have looked into this. I 've talked with- KING : The child described here was stimulating himself? Ms. REISMAN : Twenty-four hours around the clock and doing this? KING : All right- Mr. McLLVENNA : They looked at children 24 hours, around the clock, to see if they were stimulating themselves. Obviously, they did n't do it for 24 hours @!KING Bloomington, Indiana, hello. 3rd CALLER : Bloomington, Indiana Hi, Bloomington? This is- Larry? KING : Yeah. 3rd CALLER : Yeah, my question is for Dr. Reisman. Ms. REISMAN : Yes. 3rd CALLER : Dr. Reisman, what are your thoughts on the Hite report on male and female sexuality? Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Ms. REISMAN : I have mixed feelings about it. I mean, some of it was done fairly well, I thought, and some of it not, but I really could n't address it thoroughly @!KING Manchester, Vermont, hello. 4th CALLER : Manchester, Vermont Yes, hello, I want to say, when I was 17 years old I was interviewed by Dr. Pomeroy at U.C. Berkeley for the book that came out on women 's sexuality. It was in 1948. Nothing inappropriate occurred in that interview at all. As a matter of fact, I grew up to get a Ph.D. in social science and I still remember the correctness and appropriateness of the interview. Dr. Pomeroy was both reassuring and the questions were developed in a way that, if they went beyond my experience, that line of questioning was dropped and we went on to something else @!KING All right, Judith? Ms. REISMAN : Well, I have to read to you : ' The observers emphasize there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged, varied and repeated stimulation. ' Even these young boys, he says, though- it probably represents psychological blockage more than physiological incapacity @!KING All right, we 're running close on time here. Ted, you 're contending that this study is important to give us an understanding about not only sex then, but sex later, right? Mr. McLLVENNA : Yes, if you look at sexology as a science of what people do and how they feel about it, you look at everything they do. And they did it in the careful- most ethical, nonpejorative- Ms. REISMAN : Larry, I would say that- Mr. McLLVENNA : They did not intrude on the rights of those children. Ms. REISMAN : -this requires an investigation. You 're talking about a scientific- KING : Well, I mean, but you could bring charges here. Ms. REISMAN : Oh, I mean, that 's what I 'm hoping to do @!KING Have you gone to Indiana and filed charges? Ms. REISMAN : That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KING All right, we 'll be right back. We thank you both very much for coming. We promise to do more on this. An extraordinary case, the case of ' Bambi. ' She escaped ; she got caught. We 'll investigate it ourselves after this. Do n't go away @!ANNOUNCER Coming up : The capture of a beautiful murderess and the man who says she 's innocent. Commercial break Is ' Bambi ' Innocent? KING : By the way, tomorrow night on The Capital Gang at 7:00 Eastern - it 's the best discussion show on television - the special guest-panelist is Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut. The capture of Lawrencia ' Bambi ' Bembenik has rekindled interest in the former model who was convicted of murdering her husband 's ex-wife. Her imprisonment nearly a decade ago is still a hot topic for debate. Is she really a cold-blooded killer, or was she set up? Ira Robins has been investigating this case and he says he knows who the real murderer is, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beauty has pulled the wool over everyone 's eyes. With us here in the studio is Ira Robins. In Miami is Fred Schultz. Bambi - what? - escaped and was caught through America 's Most Wanted? IRA ROBINS, Homicide Investigator : That 's correct @!KING She broke out of a prison? Mr. ROBINS : Out of Taycheet sp? Institution in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, yes @!KING OK, would you briefly describe the crime? Mr. ROBINS : She was convicted of murdering Elfred Schultz 's first wife @!KING Motive? Mr. ROBINS : According to the state, they said that she had wanted to have his alimony payments cut and that 's basically it @!KING She was married to Fred and she killed Fred 's ex-wife? Mr. ROBINS : Allegedly, yes @!KING Because Fred was paying her money and she did n't want Fred to pay her money? Mr. ROBINS : That 's correct @!KING This occurred where? Mr. ROBINS : In Milwaukee, Wisconsin @!KING How was Mrs. Schultz killed? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the house at night. Apparently- In my belief, there were two people or more. The state says there was only one person @!KING What was the evidence that linked Bambi? Mr. ROBINS : A gun that Elfred Schultz possessed and turned in 22 days later - it was his gun ; they tried to say it was the same gun that they had checked on the night of the murder - a wig that was found in a toilet that we know somebody else appeared to have placed in there and some hair fibers that are similar @!KING Did the defense retain you as an investigator? Mr. ROBINS : I was- I came in on this approximately six years- after she had been in prison two years - or six years ago @!KING Did the appeal- What called you in? How did you get in? Mr. ROBINS : An individual gave me information and asked me to take a look and I contacted the attorney. When I started looking at the police reports and then the case, it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've come forward on this case? Mr. ROBINS : I 've worked on it for six years for free @!KING For free? Mr. ROBINS : Yes @!KING Do you know Bambi? Mr. ROBINS : I 've met her. I 'd worked on it about eight or nine months before I ever met her @!KING Were you surprised that she escaped? Mr. ROBINS : Yes, I was devastated by it. I could see why she did it, but I was bothered by it, yes @!KING Who do you think did it? Mr. ROBINS : I believe that Elfred Schultz, as a party to the crime, is guilty of first-degree murder @!KING Our other guest? Mr. ROBINS : Yes @!KING Why would Fred have killed his ex-wife? Mr. ROBINS : It 's easy. He threatened to kill the woman. He stole the keys to her house. It was his gun. It was his support payments that he wanted to get reduced. He lied about his whereabouts on the night of the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court @!KING Fred, I 'll give you a chance in a second. Why did n't the police act on that? Mr. ROBINS : That 's what I want to know @!KING Fred, what do you say happened? ELFRED SCHULTZ, Murderer 's Ex-Husband : Well, I feel very sorry for Ira because he 's being taken, just like a whole lot of other people have been taken in this. She was convicted upon physical evidence and a combination of circumstantial evidence. There was no key stolen to the house. I had nothing to do with the crime and Bembenik 's hair samples were recovered from a gag in Christine 's mouth at the crime scene. She was the only one with access to the gun. She was seen using that gun and playing with it some two weeks before the homicide and she had all the- She had no alibi that night to begin with. She also had the biggest reason in the world to kill Christine. She knew that if Christine would vacate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold and - because I built that house - there was over $ 65,000 in equity and she was after money. She always will be and she 'll always use people the rest of her life, just like Ira 's being used @!KING Did you believe she did it? Mr. SCHULTZ : Of course, she did it @!KING I mean, no, no- I mean, Fred, did you believe it right away? Mr. SCHULTZ : No, I did n't. She took me a long- It took me a long time and finally, I was privy to the physical evidence of this case after being sequestered by the court and by the police department, but it was too late. I lost the house- KING : All right, let me get a break and pick this up. Our guests are Ira Robins, the investigator who believes Bambi is innocent ; and Fred Schultz, the ex-husband of Bambi, who says she did it. We 'll include your phone calls. We 'll get right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Live in Washington. Do n't go away. Commercial break JUDGE : Milwaukee, Wisconsin, March 1982 That you, Lawrencia Bembenik, are to serve a term of life imprisonment- KING : Our guests are, here in Washington, Ira Robins, the homicide investigator who believes Bambi - who you saw being sentenced there to life in prison - is innocent of this crime and he believes that one of the perpetrators is our other guest, in Miami, Fred Schultz, the ex-husband of Bambi. Fred was a police officer, right? Mr. ROBINS : He was a full detective in the Milwaukee department @!KING And are you claiming that was part of the reason they covered for him? Are you saying the Milwaukee police department is going to cover for a murderer because he was a policeman? Mr. ROBINS : They had so many things go on as far as corruption under the department- Mr. SCHULTZ : There was no corruption- Mr. ROBINS : The only thing I 've been asking anybody to do is let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Fred mentioned about the evidence found on the gag? Mr. ROBINS : The only evidence that- KING : How could Bambi 's hair get on that gag unless she- Mr. ROBINS : There was no evidence that ever said anything was hers- Mr. SCHULTZ : Oh, Ira, why do n't you tell the truth that tells of physical evidence- Mr. ROBINS : They only said the evidence was similar. That 's all they said @!KING Just similar? Mr. ROBINS : Similar. Mr. SCHULTZ : Why do n't you tell us of the physical evidence? KING : How was she convicted? Mr. ROBINS : Well, they did n't go after anybody else. Her attorney was paid by Elfred Schultz secretly prior to trial, during trial and after trial. He signed over the deceased woman 's house- Mr. SCHULTZ : That 's a lie, Ira, and you know it. Mr. ROBINS : I 've got the document. Put me to the test. Mr. SCHULTZ : Yeah, put you to the test- Mr. ROBINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing. Mr. SCHULTZ : The only documents you have, Ira, are fictitious. You know, this decision- Mr. ROBINS : You 've got your signature on them. They came out of your court file, your paternity actions- Mr. SCHULTZ : What would you do if you was sic married- you were married to somebody? Mr. ROBINS : -everything else. They 're all in there. Mr. SCHULTZ : Would you support your wife if she was arrested for murder? You 're damn-well right you would- Mr. ROBINS : No. Mr. SCHULTZ : -and you know it! Mr. ROBINS : Absolutely incorrect. Not if I was in your situation- Mr. SCHULTZ : Yes, you would, until there was evidence proving her guilt. You would support her and any man in this United States would do that. Mr. ROBINS : Listen, she paid- her family paid the attorney- Mr. SCHULTZ : You are calling the judicial system a fool- Mr. ROBINS : -and you turned- KING : One at a time, guys. Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You are calling four appellate judges fools. You are calling the FBI fools. You are calling the judicial system, the DA 's office, the police department, and everybody else fools. You are not as smart as they are- Mr. ROBINS : I am saying our system is there to seek the truth and until the truth is out- Mr. SCHULTZ : Well, you 're not even working with it- Mr. ROBINS : -guys like you walk the street- Mr. SCHULTZ : You loved it when Bembenik escaped. You call that working within the system? How do I know you had n't had something to do with that? Mr. ROBINS : Put me to the test. You prove that and I 'll prove my case against you @!KING All right, has anybody ever taken- Mr. SCHULTZ : You have no proof @!KING Guys, hold on a second. Has anybody ever taken a lie-detector? Mr. ROBINS : He has and he had passed it. Lawrencia passed two lie-detector tests @!KING They both passed? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHULTZ : There is no proof of her passing a lie-detector test that 's been presented to any district attorney or any judicial process- Mr. ROBINS : I 've got it in my file and it was presented to the district attorney- Mr. SCHULTZ : And that lie-detector test was not proved to be the accurate lie-detector test that I had taken at the Strait sp? crime lab @!KING Fred, when did- Mr. SCHULTZ : I was in the presence- KING : Fred, when did you- Mr. SCHULTZ : I was in the presence, Larry, of- KING : When did you realize your wife did it? Mr. SCHULTZ : I realized it after the police department made me privy to the physical evidence from this case and all during the trial, I was never told any of it and I got taken real hard and came down real bad from this whole thing. She has the ability to take a lot of people out @!KING OK, now what made you, Ira, think that this was a wrong- What turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 've got secret- KING : Yes, but what instance occurred? Was there an instance? Mr. ROBINS : Just as soon as I started to read- This is n't even close. This is so bad, Larry - it 's phenomenal. I mean- KING : It 's so bad that the appellate courts, the FBI - nobody wants to listen and it 's this terrible? Mr. ROBINS : Well, under the circumstances, what happens when you go in there - the truth is all concealed. You ask the police department for records ; they conceal it. There are fingerprints. I 've got the latent case numbers that they 've concealed from the- KING : Where was Bambi the night of the murder? Mr. ROBINS : She was home at her house that she shared with Elfred- Mr. SCHULTZ : She had no alibi. She had no alibi. Mr. ROBINS : Now, Elfred, at the same time, was the investigating detective on a burglary that did n't know there were suspects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and another detective in my presence- Mr. ROBINS : -and at the same time- at the same time, after that, he wrote in his reports - as did his partner - their activities. And immediately after he was granted immunity, he testified that he was someplace else. The district attorney was on notice at that time that he was someplace else and they still crashed it through the court. Mr. SCHULTZ : The district attorney granted me immunity, Larry, because- Mr. ROBINS : Yeah, why? KING : Hold it- Mr. SCHULTZ : -he was afraid I was going to protect her at that time. Now, from the time I punched in my timeclock at the police department, three or four hours earlier to that incident, I was in the presence of my partner - who is a full detective - and other uniformed police officers and never out of their presence until after I was notified of the crime by phone and that is a fact @!KING OK, let me get some calls. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira Robins in Washington - hello. 5th CALLER : Grandview, Missouri Yes, I have a question for Mr. Schultz. It just seems kind of funny that she knows so much about his ex-wife, the woman who was murdered. Somehow, she found out all these different things from somebody. And it also seems funny to me that he is in community service - you know, he 's a detective - therefore, it's- You know, all these different things. Was he even questioned as a suspect? KING : Were you ever a suspect, Fred? Mr. SCHULTZ : Yes, I was. As a matter of fact, there 's been a lot of misleading statements regarding this. Lori hired her own attorney of her own accord with her parents, without me being present. Also, his first question was, ' We 've got to go after Fred. Fred must have had something to do with this, ' and her statement is, ' Fred did not do this crime. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course, now that she 's convicted - and the evidence that was physical and circumstantial convicted her - now she 's changing her tune. She 's fluttering her eyes at America and attempting to gain their confidence and swoon them, but she is, in fact, the cold-blooded murderer of the mother of my children and she murdered Christine Schultz. Period. Mr. ROBINS : It 's a conflict of interest to consider somebody a suspect and take money from that person- Mr. SCHULTZ : There 's no conflict of interest- Mr. ROBINS : -and not go after that person @!KING Well, where does this case stand right now? Is anybody open to your thoughts? Mr. ROBINS : The Milwaukee police supervisors ' union today asked me to put up or shut up. They went on television. I 've been pleading with anybody to let me show what I 've got. I 'd like to go and ask the Federal- KING : What would be the key thing you would show? If the FBI calls you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key reason to reopen this case ' - Mr. ROBINS : There are so many things- KING : No, what would be one? Mr. ROBINS : The reports that I can prove- Mr. SCHULTZ : They gave him that offer, Larry @!KING Tell me. Mr. ROBINS : For example, under Latent Case 27690 in the Milwaukee police department, they have fingerprints and photographs of Elfred Schultz in the nude standing in the park in front of hundreds of people and the guy next to him is masturbating with little children. They have those pictures- Mr. SCHULTZ : Oh, that 's a lie- Mr. ROBINS : -with fingerprints on them- KING : OK, now hold on one second. Pictures of- Mr. SCHULTZ : That 's an absolute lie @!KING -Fred Schultz nude in a park with someone masturbating? That does n't mean he 's a murderer. Mr. ROBINS : No, but they failed to disclose that information to us and they 've just declined to say- any officers have ever- KING : Fred, are you saying no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm saying that he 's been doing this for 10 years. He 's been throwing around garbage. I do not deny the fact that I was intoxicated and was nude in a park, but I 'm going to tell you something- Mr. ROBINS : That 's a crime- Mr. SCHULTZ : -that has nothing to do with any- that has nothing to do with Lawrencia Bembenik- KING : That does n't make him a murderer- Mr. SCHULTZ : -being a cold-hearted killer. That is a fact in this case and nothing else. She killed Christine Schultz @!KING Minneapolis, hello. 6th CALLER : Minneapolis, Minnesota Yes, does Ira suspect a conspiracy in the police department since, number one, Fred himself is a police officer and, number two, he 's apparently engaging in intense character-assassination aimed at Bambi? Mr. ROBINS : The fact of the matter is that the Milwaukee police department has withheld reports. They 've concealed evidence. They 've tampered with evidence. They 've fabricated witnesses. I can prove this. All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Investigation let me prove it to them @!KING All right, we 're going to have to follow up more on this and I thank you both very much for coming. Mr. ROBINS : Thank you @!KING Ira Robins and Fred Schultz. This is Larry King Live in Washington. You have all heard of the Bermuda Triangle and the mysterious disappearance of Flight 19. Somebody says Flight 19 just disappeared ; somebody else says they know where it is. We 'll come back and discuss that after this @!ANNOUNCER Coming up : The disappearance of Flight 19. Was it a wrong turn or a mysterious force? Commercial break The Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle KING : You have certainly read about it in newspapers, heard about it on television - saw it on television - heard about it on radio, the ghoulish patch of the Atlantic Ocean where ships and airplanes - there you see it - vanish into thin air. It is called the Bermuda Triangle. The theory that has haunted these waters since time immemorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five Navy planes back in 1945. Jon Myhre has made the mystery of Flight 19 his life 's work and, after years of research, he claims to have found one of the missing planes and believes he knows what happened on that infamous flight. He is joined by the well-known linguist-turned-author who wrote the book The Bermuda Triangle and really is most- his name is linked with it forever, Charles Berlitz, who believes in the concept of the Bermuda Triangle. Mr. Myhre has not changed his mind. Let 's get a quick little history here, Jon. What happened in 1945? December 5th, right? JON MYHRE, Bermuda Triangle Debunker : That 's correct. December 5th at 2:10 p.m., five Navy torpedo bombers departed from the naval air station in Fort Lauderdale on a low-level navigation training flight that was supposed to take about three hours @!KING Over the water and back? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct. It was a three-legged flight and, essentially, there was a combination of factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KING And never came back? Mr. MYHRE : And never came back @!KING And until recently, never found? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct @!KING OK, they were gone and it was reported as one of those mysteries of the sky, right? Mr. MYHRE : That was- Flight 19 was the- KING : Why was it called Flight 19 if there were five? Mr. MYHRE : Well, Flight 18 went out just before it, so it was the 19th flight of the day @!KING And there were five of them? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct @!KING OK, were there extensive searches? Mr. MYHRE : There was- One of the biggest searches in peacetime history to that point was conducted over a five-day period and they found - according to the investigation - found no wreckage or anything- KING : Nothing? Mr. MYHRE : Nothing @!KING Charles, was this- Are we correct? Is that the beginning of the Bermuda Triangle story? CHARLES BERLITZ, Author, ' The Bermuda Triangle ' : I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and strange things that he saw from the sea, and from then on - especially in our own Civil War period and since - there have been disappearances of very large ships- KING : In that area? Mr. BERLITZ : In exactly that area between Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Florida @!KING And Flight 19 is one of those mysteries? Mr. BERLITZ : Yes @!KING What have you discovered, Jon? Mr. MYHRE : Well, I 've discovered- After reading an account of this thing in 1982 that had excerpts of some of the radio transcripts, I said, ' Hey, if some of these factors are fairly close, I can figure out where the first airplane went down, ' based on geography, based on performance of the aircraft - this type of thing. I went back to my hotel room and I plotted out a point that came very, very close to my final calculation - which entailed about seven years of research - to a point off the Florida coast, about 30 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself - mounted an expedition with a remote operating vehicle with a television camera and lights. We went down to that spot- KING : And? Mr. MYHRE : -and we found a TBM Avenger @!KING Under the water? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct @!KING Why were you so involved in this all your life? Mr. MYHRE : Well, I have n't been all my life. I started in the summer of 1982 @!KING I see. What do you do for a living? Mr. MYHRE : Well, I was a commercial pilot ; I was an army pilot ; and the last six years I was working for the Federal Aviation Administration @!KING Charles, why do n't you accept this? There it is. Mr. BERLITZ : The bottom seems to be covered with these sort of planes. In other words, they were practice planes and finding one - unless you find the number, the number of the motor- I would like to ask Mr. Myhre if he- KING : Now, that picture is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's correct, the TBM Avenger- Mr. BERLITZ : That 's the Aztec Avenger @!KING If he found one, if he saw it- Do you believe he found a plane there? Mr. BERLITZ : These planes have been found constantly. Not in groups of five, but- KING : Does n't it give you some answer if you find wreckage? Mr. BERLITZ : Of course, but you have to find the number. It was known - the motor number of the different planes and so far, that has n't been found, unless Mr. Myhre has been able to check the number @!KING OK, has another plane of this type been reported missing? Mr. BERLITZ : Yes, many other planes- KING : Many other planes? Mr. BERLITZ : -because they were practice planes. Mr. MYHRE : That 's right. There was sic a lot of them that did crash off the Florida coast and- KING : Well, why do you believe this one is 19? Mr. MYHRE : Well, there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research- We did n't just go out and poke holes in the ocean at a certain spot based on a whim. There 's a great deal of corroborating evidence that I have which I will bring forth- KING : You 're writing a book? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct, we 're in the process of writing a book now @!KING Where do you think the other four are? Mr. MYHRE : The other four went in different directions and I 've got a good handle on those also. Let me ask- Let me just answer Mr. Berlitz about numbers. We went down again this past July in a submersible four-man submarine. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute out of Fort Pierce, we went down with those folks. We had a total of three dives on the wreckage that we 've located and while we did n't identify it by number, we did identify it by type, which was a TBM-1C. And going through the Navy, we have determined that there was sic only three of those particular TBM-1C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was sic only three of them that could have ended with ' 209 ' in a five Navy bureau number sic. We have located a ' 209, ' an ' L209 ' on the left outboard wing tip- KING : Charles? Mr. MYHRE : -and there's- We also got, from the Navy Historical Society, a letter stating that there was no- The other two- KING : Did not have that on them? Mr. MYHRE : -did not have an accident- KING : Charles? Mr. MYHRE : -so it could n't have been off of an aircraft carrier @!KING Seems logical, Charles. Mr. BERLITZ : Well, I wonder if Mr. Myhre knows about the preceding year, when the war was still going on, that in that area another flight of six planes disappeared? Are you familiar with that? Mr. MYHRE : Charles, I 'm not familiar with that. Mr. BERLITZ : And since that time, in Bermuda, a plane disappeared while it was in company with another flight. It went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break. Mr. BERLITZ : -disassociated itself- KING : The book is coming out next year? Mr. MYHRE : We 're working on it, Larry @!KING All right, with Jon Myhre and Charles Berlitz - back with more after this. Commercial break KING : Our guests are Jon Myhre, who has researched the flight of Flight 19 - he believes he 's solved at least part of the mystery - and Charles Berlitz, linguist and author of The Bermuda Triangle. And we 're looking forward to lots more information from Jon coming forth, right? A book will be coming and we 'll do lots more programs on this. Let 's take some calls. Alexandria, Virginia, hello. 7th CALLER : Alexandria, Virginia Yes, good evening, gentlemen. I would like to know how they explain when those boats have turned up with the people are sic missing but the food is still there, the clothing is still there and there 's no sign of a struggle. Thank you @!KING Jon, do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I do not believe in the Bermuda Triangle, per se @!KING You believe there 's an explanation of all this? Mr. MYHRE : I think- I think there is. It was n't my intention, when I started this research, to torpedo the Bermuda Triangle mystery, per se. It just so happened that Flight 19 was the kingpin on the mystery @!KING I see. Charles, you mentioned that you were n't out to prove a Bermuda Triangle. You were just asking questions. Mr. BERLITZ : Exactly. I think that whatever is going on in the Bermuda Triangle - and what we have is not this one Flight 19 ; we have hundreds of planes and ships that have disappeared under very unusual circumstances- KING : All right, and you believe that 's open to conjecture? Mr. BERLITZ : Unless we study it and try and find out - and that 's why I 'm all in favor of- KING : You 've got to be in favor of what Jon 's doing. Mr. BERLITZ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant to learning if this was part of Flight 19? Mr. BERLITZ : Well, nobody really believes in the Bermuda Triangle, except at the moment that they themselves are disappearing in it. I imagine that would be rather convincing. Thousands of people- KING : Yes, but I mean, you 'd like to learn if this is one of them, would n't you? Mr. BERLITZ : Of course @!KING Lancaster, Pennsylvania, hello. 8th CALLER : Lancaster, Pennsylvania Good evening, gentlemen. Larry, great show @!KING Thank you. 8th CALLER : I 'd like to ask one question and then make a comment. Several years ago in Pennsylvania, apparently, some object came across the sky and then landed in an area which there's- apparently, the military came out and scuttled it away, but the question I have is : A lot of times there have been patterns in cornfields and I have understood- KING : I think that 's off the topic, though. I 'd like to stay on- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain sound that, when people scanned the area for- some kind of sound came up and I was wondering if anybody tested the Bermuda Triangle for some type of sound pattern @!KING Have we ever had a sound come out of it, Charles? Good question. Mr. BERLITZ : The people who 've heard the sound are not here to advise us @!KING Yes, but a lot of people fly out of the Bermuda Triangle every day and land. Mr. BERLITZ : Well, of course, but what is especially interesting about the Bermuda Triangle - besides the disappearances of people, planes and ships - are the ones who have n't disappeared who have had experiences in there, including myself- KING : Do any say sound- Mr. BERLITZ : -and many others @!KING Do any report sound? No? Mr. MYHRE : I do n't know. Mr. BERLITZ : No, there is an element of unreality about this. In regard to the gentleman on the phone, he probably knows about the same things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields- KING : We 'll come right back. I 'm sorry, time runs so fast, but sometimes we squash it in too much. We 'll be right back with Jon Myhre and Charles Berlitz. First, these words. Commercial break KING : I promise you, we 'll do a more extensive program on this in the near future. Columbus, Ohio, hello. 9th CALLER : Columbus, Ohio Yes, I had heard that another flight went out to look for Flight 19 and it also disappeared. Is that correct? Mr. MYHRE : That is correct. Yes, sir. Mr. BERLITZ : It was a large plane with a crew of 15. Mr. MYHRE : No, it was a crew of 13 @!KING Thirteen? And it disappeared? Mr. MYHRE : It was a TBM Martin Mariner sp? - Mr. BERLITZ : Martin Mariner @!KING Do n't you think that 's a little strange? Mr. MYHRE : No, sir. That airplane was a flying gas tank. It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot who was on the search for Flight 19 two days after it disappeared. One of his pilots called him and said, ' Hey, boss, I got four inches of gas in the cockpit, ' and the commander told him, ' Do n't make another transmission ; do n't turn anything off or on ; just make a shallow turn and go home. ' So there 's no mystery in that. It was tracked from the time it took off at 7:25 until it blew up off the New Smyrna Beach, Florida @!KING Are you going to be interested in Jon's- when all of his evidence comes forward, Charles? Mr. BERLITZ : Of course, you have to sometimes be sure about what you 're looking for. You know, Mel Fisher, the diver - treasure diver - he thought he had something really, really good on the bottom - probably a deposit of gold or another plane or something like that - and it turned out to be a locomotive from the Florida- KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There 's no doubt, Jon, in your mind. You have one of these planes? Mr. MYHRE : That 's correct @!KING You 've seen it? Mr. MYHRE : I have seen it. I have seen the ' 209. ' I have seen the documentation. Obviously, I know a lot that I have n't brought out yet @!KING And obviously, we 're going to learn a lot more. Jon Myhre and Charles Berlitz, thank you coming. Nice seeing you again, Charles. Mr. MYHRE : Thank you, Larry. Mr. BERLITZ : Thank you @!KING Patrick and Donna are standing by in Atlanta. They 're going to co-anchor the news at the top of the hour. What 's up, guys? PATRICK EMORY : Larry, from the mystery you 've been discussing to another kind of a mystery tonight : When you listen to the President talk about the Persian Gulf these days, are you hearing a hidden message? DONNA KELLEY : One senator 's aide thinks there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' philosophy applied to getting rid of roaches? Mr. EMORY : Oh, sure, there are n't any roaches any more, but at what cost to an apartment and the neighbors? And Rhett and Scarlett on the big screen adored by Soviet moviegoers. Ms. KELLEY : Hope you can join us for tonight 's Evening News next. Larry? KING : Frankly, I do n't give a darn - a little joke there, folks. I wonder how they say that? Thanks, Pat. Thanks, Donna. We 're out of time. See you in an hour on the radio. Monday night : Joe Kennedy and Newt Gingrich. Have a great weekend.
