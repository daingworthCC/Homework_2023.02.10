4103741 @!LAUER, co-host : We 're back now at 8:14 with the return of AMC 's hit drama " Mad Men. " After being off the air for 17 months, it 's coming back on Sunday with a two-hour premiere. This morning for the very first time on TV we have the cast with us to talk to them and we 're going to do that in a moment. But first, a look at the show that 's made America nostalgic all over again. It 's a mad, mad world about so much more than advertising. @(Clip-from- " Mad-Men @!LAUER: " Mad Men " provides a window into America in the ' 60s. @!Ms-JANICE-MIN: The setting makes it glamorous. It 's about advertising in Manhattan. You see a lot of social themes playing out there that engage the audience. You see themes about sexism in the workplace, racism. You see themes about modernization. @!LAUER: " Mad Men " centers around a New York ad agency run by creative director Don Draper. It 's a role that made actor Jon Hamm a household name. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funny lines. @(Clip-from- " Mad-Men @!LAUER: Pete Campbell, the young and ambitious executive with big plans. Lane Pryce, who handles the firm 's finances and not well, and so he relies on the agency 's secret weapon, sultry, sexy Joan, the office manager who actually runs the place. Peggy Olson has emerged as the show 's feminist icon, the female copywriter in a man 's world. And there 's Betty, Don Draper 's unhappy wife, who became his ex-wife but stayed unhappy. She 's at home with three kids. Now 17 months later, " Mad Men " is back. So will the fans be back, too? I 'm glad you -- I 'm glad you thought that was funny, January. That 's good. We 're joined now by Jon Hamm, John Slattery, January Jones, creator Matthew Weiner, Vincent Kartheiser, Jared Harris and Kiernan Shipka. Good morning. Good to see you. Miss KIERNAN SHIPKA : Good morning. @!LAUER: Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here? @!Mr-JON-HAMM: We were hiding. We decided to take some time off and solve some issues but now we 're back and we 're very excited about it. @!LAUER: How bad were the issues. Be honest, all right. How close did this show come to going down the tubes? @!Mr-HAMM: Well, several of us had gender reassignment surgery so had to all have that settled. @!Mr-JOHN-SLATTERY-@: We feel great though. @!Mr-MATTHEW-WEINER-: We were not out of work as long as -- we have not been away from the show as long as the public has. There was a decision made by the network in 2010 that the show would be on in 2012. @!LAUER: Right. @!Mr-WEINER: And so we went back to -- I went back to work in May and they came back in August. So it was really just three or four months longer than normal. @!LAUER: Have you been hearing it from fans who have been saying, what 's going on here and when are you guys coming back? @!Mr-SLATTERY: Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an unfortunately long hiatus but I think now you can -- you know, you can DVR shows, you can -- you can -- you can actually find the show in ways you could n't before. So I mean, we 're actually hoping that, you know, it whetted people 's appetites even more. @!Ms-JANUARY-JONES-@: It gave people a chance to catch up. @!Mr-SLATTERY: Yeah. @!LAUER: Obviously we have to remember that although the show 's been on the air for a long time, there are people, believe it or not, who do n't know about " Mad Men " and have n't watched it. So who wants to take a shot at completing the sentence, OK. " Mad Men " is really a show about... @!Mr-HAMM: Kiernan, go! Miss SHIPKA : Don Draper 's life. @!LAUER: Yeah? OK. @!Mr-HAMM: See, she 's always dependable. @!LAUER: How about completing this sentence. It has connected with audiences because... Miss SHIPKA : Drinking. @!LAUER: Drinking and smoking. @!Mr-WEINER: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the show has very sort of realistic -- the characters have realistic problems. There 's not a lot of explosions. There 's not a lot of like car chases and things like that. But the problems that they have are very closely related to what people live with. @!LAUER: It 's about the dialogue when it comes right down to it. It 's brilliantly written and it 's about this... @!Mr-WEINER: That 's what I was going to say. @!LAUER: Yeah. I took the words right out of your mouth. It 's also -- we -- it 's uncomfortable. We sit there and there are times when you 're made uncomfortable watching this show because of the things you 're doing that are inappropriate and it 's weird that you 're all so good at them. @!Mr-HAMM: Well, I think it 's also, it 's set, you know, far enough in the past that it does feel different and yet it 's not too far in the past to where it feels old-timey or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- people can get a sense of feeling a part away from that, you know, so they can have a vicarious thrill of that behavior and that acting out and yet still identify with it. @!Mr-WEINER: It 's also not judgmental. I mean there 's something about it that sort of embraces on some level that we are flawed people and there 's not really this -- it is a moral universe, you know, it 's not like it 's immoral but people behave badly. It 's why the Ten Commandments are there. You know what I mean? It 's like, these are the things that we do and the show sort of treats them in a way that 's very realistic. And you watch the show and you can feel superior to the characters on some level but you also recognize a lot of the bad behavior. You know, it 's mothering and being a child and being a bad husband, all those things. @!LAUER: Well, you bring up mothering. Just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been off the air, January, you actually had a baby during the hiatus. That child is now in college, I believe. Zander is what, six months old now? @!Ms-JONES: Yeah, yeah. @!LAUER: Yeah? How are you doing? @!Ms-JONES: I 'm doing really well. He 's awesome. @!LAUER: Is it true -- and I read this and sometimes you ca n't believe everything you read -- that some fans of the show take it so seriously. You 're not a good mom on the show. @!Ms-JONES: Well, yeah. @!Mr-WEINER: That 's not true. @!LAUER: Oh, come on. You 're not a great mom. @!Ms-JONES: She 's not a great mom. @!Mr-WEINER: She 's a typical mom. @!LAUER: I 'm going to go with your side of this. @!Ms-JONES: I do n't write the show. @!LAUER: And have you had fans who have actually kind of worried about what kind of a mom you 're going to be? @!Ms-JONES: Yeah, I think so. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know -- I can only surprise people with my mothering that 's -- I do n't know, how can I say this politely? @!Mr-HAMM: I do n't know. @!LAUER: Do you ever want to say to the fans, it 's just a show. @!Mr-HAMM: We 're on the same show. @!LAUER: It 's -- no, it 's just a show. I would n't say -- I ca n't say I 'm a good mother, but... @!Mr-WEINER: Even Betty Draper -- even Betty Draper likes babies. I mean, that 's not going to be the problem. @!Mr-HAMM: Well, and January and I were on the same flight out here, too with Zander and he was incredibly well-behaved the entire flight. So I have to say that. @!LAUER: Who 's the practical joker on the cast? John? @!Mr-WEINER: John, yeah. @!Mr-SLATTERY: Am I the practical joker? No. @!Mr-WEINER: And Vinny. @!LAUER: Vin. @!Mr-VINCENT-KARTHEI: No, it 's one of these two guys. @!Mr-SLATTERY: There are n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic evidence of some of your practical jokes. @!LAUER: We 've had some of those graphics we 'd like to bring up. I have a feeling we ca n't put those up there, right? @!Mr-KARTHEISER: No, probably not. @!LAUER: Kiernan, what 's it like for you? How old are you? Miss SHIPKA : Twelve. @!LAUER: You 're 12 years old and your on this show with all these adults, though there 's some other kids as well, and you 're dealing with very adult themes. Do you ever think, ' I could be on Nickelodeon or ' I could be on Disney doing something? ' Miss SHIPKA : I do but I 'm really happy where I am right now. It 's a great show to be on and I 'm so thankful for it. @!Mr-WEINER: You would n't get to drink and smoke as much on Nickelodeon. @!Mr-HAMM: Less so. @!Mr-WEINER: Less. @!LAUER: Jon, you made some headlines recently. OK. You were talking -- you were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said this, quote, " Whether it 's Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated. Being a blanking idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you 're rewarded significantly. " Now Kim Kardashian had some comments about that and said your remarks were careless. Do you want to explain? Do you want to expand? Do you want to do anything? @!Mr-HAMM: No, I do n't think they were careless. I think they were accurate. But it 's a part of our culture that I certainly do n't identify with and I do n't really understand the appeal of it other than, you know, sort of car crash sensibility and it 's not something that I partake in or enjoy. But it is what it is and here we are, so. @!LAUER: Anybody else want to jump into the pool? The water 's beautiful. @!Mr-HAMM: You 'll enjoy it. @!Mr-KARTHEISER: I agree. @!LAUER: You agree? Go ahead. @!Mr-KARTHEISER: I agree, yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquently. @!LAUER: That was -- you just supporting your friend here or do you agree to the whole concept? @!Mr-KARTHEISER: No, I agree with everything he said. I mean, I think our society enjoys to turn on the television and see someone who 's maybe awful and they can say, ' Well, at least I 'm not as terrible as that person. ' @!LAUER: Is there room for both things though? I mean, you have a wonderfully written, beautifully acted show here and it 's a great luxury and it 's a nice position to be in. But do you understand that there is an audience for all things out there? @!Mr-HAMM: There 's a lot of channels on the dial and those channels need to be filled up with things. And listen, it 's a different strokes for different folks, I suppose. @!LAUER: Matthew, have you started to think about how this show comes to an end? Is this seventh season going to be the last season? @!Mr-WEINER: This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I meant to say fifth. @!Mr-WEINER: And yeah, we 're talking about doing seven seasons. @!LAUER: You 're going to do seven? @!Mr-WEINER: That 's the plan for right now. I do n't want... @!LAUER: Have you started to think about how you 're going to kill -- I mean, how you 're going to -- how you 're going to end all these story lines? @!Mr-WEINER: You know what? People keep asking me that so I better get on it. No, I have like a -- I have a vague idea of what it is. I think it 's interesting that people keep asking about it. And for me, it 's -- no -- you know, what I mean? About how is it going to -- or do I know. Because they really, when we get to the end of the show, they 're going to have to take my word for it. I could say, ' Oh, yeah, I thought of that you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me it 's like I think that they want the tension alleviated, that there is a plan or something, but for me I really do n't even want to think about it ending yet, you know. @!LAUER: So it 's not like some fiery crash, you know, all on the same plane type thing. I 'm looking in your eyes, I 'm starting to think maybe. @!Mr-WEINER: No, no, no. We ca n't afford that. @!LAUER: Do you have an idea of how you -- that 's too big of a budget to sustain that? @!Mr-WEINER: Yeah, we do n't do that. There 'll be a -- there will be the reflection of a fiery crash in a window. @!LAUER: Have you guys thought about what it would be like to put this behind you? I mean, you almost had to think about that over the last 17 months. @!Mr-SLATTERY: I just like to be vertical. I just like to be in the end, you know? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it to the final episode? @!Mr-SLATTERY: I 've had some scrapes and I do n't think -- I mean, I think I can probably safely speak for all of us and we all feel very lucky to have this job and I think it occurred to us early on that this is n't like a lot of television experiences and we 're lucky to have it. And it is n't going to go on forever, but we 're enjoying it while we 're here. @!LAUER: Based on the number of people in the studio this morning, a lot of people are happy you are back. Congratulations on season five -- sorry about that. And you can catch the two-hour premiere this Sunday night on AMC. Just ahead, Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart after your local news. '
