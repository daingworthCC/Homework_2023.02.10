237141 ANNOUNCER : From Washington, Crossfire. On the left, Mike Kinsley. On the right, Pat Buchanan. Tonight, An Iraqi Shell Game? In the crossfire, Ambassador Edward Peck, former U.S. diplomat to Iraq. And nuclear arms analyst Leonard Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. MIKE KINSLEY : Good evening. Welcome to Crossfire. Saddam Hussein may just have spared himself another visit from the United States Air Force today. Three times this week Iraqi soldiers have refused to allow United Nations observers to examine suspected nuclear weapons sites. Suspicious equipment seen from a distance has disappeared. In the third incident just this morning soldiers fired shots in the air, that was too much for President Bush. President GEORGE BUSH : We ca n't, from a U.S. standpoint, permit this brutal bully to go back on what was a solemn agreement and to threaten people that are there under U.N. jurisdiction and that 's exactly what he appears to have done. The man has no shame @!KINSLEY The Pentagon and the White House are known to be reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully with U.N. inspectors but if he does n't is it back to war to keep Saddam Hussein 's finger off the nuclear button? Pat? PAT BUCHANAN : Leonard Spector, how close can Saddam Hussein really be to be developing an atomic weapon if as he said today he 's invited us or the U.N. inspectors, come on in and look at it? LEONARD SPECTOR, Nuclear Arms Analyst : Well, if he really lets us in and we can see everything I think we 'll have confidence that he is n't very close, but meanwhile we do n't quite know and we do know that there was material and equipment that we were unaware of when the war started @!BUCHANAN Well, let 's get right to that. We- or the readings we were getting was that Saddam Hussein was five to ten years away from building a weapons facility that produced weapons, however he had 27 pounds or so, as I recall, of enriched uranium which could be concocted in some way maybe in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put into a truck, drive into the desert toward our troops and explode his first and last bomb and probably his first and last act. Why do n't we just go in and get the 27 pounds and bring it out? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, the 27 pounds has in fact been observed and it 's going to be removed from the country. He really has n't made a fuss about that but what he is making it very difficult for us to get a hold of is all the equipment that he acquired for this longer term program and then equipment we did n't know about which we were told about by the defector which is another part of the program. It 's this part which we have been trying to track @!BUCHANAN Well, tell us about the equipment that we did n't know about. Mr. SPECTOR : Well, the equipment is an electromagnetic process to upgrade natural uranium to the weapons grade level. We do n't know how far he 's gotten with it. The defector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but most American analysts I 've talked to are pretty skeptical @!BUCHANAN Well, my understanding is there's- it takes a- what is it, it takes a diffusion plant spread over acres and all manner of equipment put into it and an enormous amount of the type of thing he might have a little bit of, is that right? Mr. SPECTOR : That 's probably true. These electromagnets can upgrade the uranium by themselves if he has enough of them and enough electricity and can get them to work. He probably ca n't do that but we want to see the devices to make sure about it and to take some samples and some readings and see how far he got @!BUCHANAN Quick, one more. If we do n't get those kinds of samples and it suggests that he 's really nowhere near a nuclear weapon, do we think ought to go in and start bombing again? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I think there 's more at stake here than these particular pieces of equipment. There 's a biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles that he 's denied having. He 's revealed some @!BUCHANAN I 've got to ask one more. Mr. SPECTOR : But not all of them @!BUCHANAN Do you think there 's a possibility that Mr. Bush seeing Saddam jerk us around a little bit and push us to the edge may see this as an opportunity and go in and get the job done that we did n't do, in other words, clean up all the nuclear, all of the chemical, all of the biological facilities, get rid of them, finish it once and for all? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I think that idea has probably crossed the minds of a number of people @!KINSLEY OK. Let 's ask Ambassador Peck. We 'll find out if it 's crossed your mind. Look, Mr. Ambassador, there was this war. There was a cease-fire. There were terms to the cease-fire. Saddam agreed to the terms. He was darn lucky to get them and he 's clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal off? Why ca n't we do exactly what Pat was just suggesting? Ambassador EDWARD PECK, Former U.S. Diplomat to Iraq : Well, I think it 's partly because what my colleague mentioned, there seems to be an aura of vindictiveness in this whole thing with Saddam Hussein, showing up in what the President just did in the little clip, you know, this bully. We 're terribly frustrated with this guy because the nation- we had- we won the war, we had this great victory and he 's still out there and searching around for other reasons other mechanisms which permit us to go in and as you say, finish the job, whatever that means. I think there 's an element of that in there which really can not be discounted @!KINSLEY There is no doubt in your mind, is there, that he is in fact attempting to build nuclear weapons? Amb @!PECK Well, I- well, I 'm not sure. Certainly he had something going in which weapons are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few days where we spot these suspicious materials and then he does n't let us see the plant and then we see from a satellite, I believe, the suspicious materials moving to another site. We ca n't see the other site. He 's got something to hide there, right? Amb @!PECK But he 's not- it 's going to be very hard to hide a football stadium which is what he 's going to have to have in order to create a weapon. I guess the thing that concerns me a little bit is we 've totally eliminated any delivery system at least for the now that he had. We 've eliminated- you know, we 've destroyed his economy, we 've destroyed his army. He has n't got an air force. The simple fact about Saddam Hussein today is that he 's no longer a threat to anybody @!KINSLEY OK, but suppose he is building nuclear weapons that would be possible five or ten years down the road? Five or ten years down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to eliminate them. Amb @!PECK That 's quite true @!KINSLEY Now we can. If he is in fact trying to build nuclear weapons, why is n't he the one person in the world we do n't have to agonize a lot about saying, there 's no point in letting him continue, we do n't want him to build them five or ten years down the road, if he 's going it now, we 're going to stop it right now? Amb @!PECK If there's- if there were the experts saying that six months ago he was five or ten years from doing it, he 's certainly a hell of a lot farther from doing it now. Mr. SPECTOR : Well, that 's not quite right. I mean, there was that short term option a few months ago when he could have taken this weapons grade material. Now, that we 're going to move out of the country, but if he has other weapons grade material and we do n't know yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still got to be worried about, you know, 100 Scuds, let 's say, that he does n't disgorge and chemical warheads and so on @!BUCHANAN Mr. Spector, let 's take a practical matter. He did n't use any chemical weapons against us and my guess is he did n't use them because he knew the Americans- all limits would be off what we did to him. He can't- I mean, if we get the 27 pounds out there and we lift the embargo and he starts- and we find that he 's bringing things in, I 'm sure the Americans will go back in and bomb him. How big a threat is this guy to anybody right now? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I think in terms of a threat of offensive action, right now there is n't a threat. He 's a threat internally obviously to some of the minorities and I think if he can reconstitute some of his forces in two or three years or what have you, you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy if he 's keeping Scud missiles under wraps and he has biological weapons to put on them or these nerve gases or what have you. The whole purpose of the resolution was to get rid of all this stuff @!BUCHANAN All right. If- all right, do you think we 're going to be able to get rid of all that stuff, he 's going to give it up or do you think we 're going to have to go in on the ground, plant by plant, take it out and destroy it or start bombing it? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, the plan is to go in plant by plant and destroy it, using the U.N. team @!BUCHANAN Have we done some of that? Mr. SPECTOR : Some of that has been done. We 've identified a lot of the material, not all of it, and we 're now having these problems of getting to actually see individual facilities. If he opens the doors again and we can look at each one, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons and the rest, but he 's got to cooperate otherwise he 's just got to play this shell game and we 're going to be out in the cold @!KINSLEY What about that? He did agree as part of the cease-fire not merely to allow these inspections but to dismantle all these weapons. Amb @!PECK Well, has n't he just announced today that he 's going to let us go ahead with- KINSLEY : Well, fine, if he actually goes through with that that 's one thing but what should we do if he does n't? Amb @!PECK Well, that 's a tough question. How long does he not do it and what are our concerns about what 's left out there? You have to wait until the situation evolves. I certainly do n't advocate that we should leave him alone to pose a threat again to the area @!BUCHANAN Mr. Spector- Amb @!PECK And the thing that concerns me is he 's not a threat but we 're treating him as if he were. Mr. SPECTOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in the short term. They 've put down a resolution with a 48-hour deadline as I understand and at that point if Saddam has not complied and actually turned over the goods that were at issue in this particular episode, additional actions will be taken @!BUCHANAN You ought to get his people away from the boxes. Mr. SPECTOR : I would think so @!BUCHANAN When we come back, what nations besides Iraq are working on atomic weapons? Commercial break BUCHANAN : Welcome back. Is the United States headed for new military action in Iraq? That possibility arose today as President Bush said Iraq was violating the cease-fire by denying U.N. inspectors access to Iraq 's nuclear program, but this afternoon Saddam Hussein was reportedly inviting the U.N. to come back and see what it wanted. Here to discuss Iraq and the A-bomb are Ambassador Edward Peck, a former U.S. diplomat in Iraq, I guess you were chief of mission there- Amb @!PECK Yes, sir @!BUCHANAN -just before the 1980 's, late seventies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Leonard Spector, would it be fair to say that you are more concerned about the Scud missiles he retains and their capacity to launch chemical warfare, bacteriological warfare then you are about him being very close to some kind of nuclear device? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, we have a bit of a question mark about the nuclear because we have this defector who claimed that there was nuclear material produced by some of these new equipment. I do n't take that too seriously but we do n't want to have a situation where the equipment that we know he has remains in his hands and equipment that can be launched against an adversary whenever he chooses, in particular the Scuds with chemical or conventional or possibly biological weapons. We know all that stuff is out there and the U.N. is supposed to go in and clean it up @!KINSLEY Well, why not do it now? That 's the point. You say this is n't a threat immediately and it may- obviously it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few months but the point is, there we are. We can do anything we want in that country now. Who knows whether that will be true down the road? Amb @!PECK And the objective is to take out these weapons systems and insure that the man is not going to pose a threat to the surrounding area and to the world towards peace and stability @!KINSLEY Sure. Amb @!PECK But we 're doing that @!KINSLEY Well, we 're going that now by maintaining our troops there. We do n't want to stay there forever. We want- Amb @!PECK We 're doing- but we want admission inspection forces and- KINSLEY : Let me ask you. Let me put it another way. What is the downside of doing something to solve this problem once and for all? Amb @!PECK Well, when you say to solve this problem once and for all, what is it that you mean? KINSLEY : I mean, that if Saddam Hussein waves people away from another inspection, the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion was pretty clearly ready to do it today, backed off because Saddam made the nice words. If Saddam blinks one more time, go in and make sure that his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons facilities will not be a threat to anybody for the next decade. Amb @!PECK By doing what? KINSLEY : By bombing them. Amb @!PECK Oh, by bombing them, wherever they are @!KINSLEY Well, I- you tell me the details. They seem to think that it 's a fairly practical thing to do. Mr. SPECTOR : I think what may have to- I mean, the way you want to go about this is on the ground with the U.N. teams, but you have to get access and it may be necessary if worse comes to the worst to bomb a site or two more to remind Saddam that he 's still under the gun. Now, I 'm not recommending that, I 'm just saying we may be forced into that mode and I think that 's why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downside? BUCHANAN : Why are you smiling at that? Amb @!PECK No, it 's just the comment that he made there. I 've forgotten the particular phrase but, we 'd have to bomb a site or two to see what 's going on. I think there 's a certain amount of hesitation on Mr. Spector 's part as well as mine to just- to launch another, you know, major military effort there in order to remove something which we 're not sure about @!BUCHANAN Let me turn to the thing that bothers me. Mr. SPECTOR : Bombing will not get everything. There 's no question about it but if it becomes necessary to do bombing in order to enforce the resolution so that the U.N. teams can go in, then you may have to take that step but it 's got to be done on the ground eventually @!BUCHANAN Well, let me tell you what bothers me and it 's not the attack on the nuclear facilities. Obviously if he 's building an atomic bomb, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do it sooner rather than later and even the Scud missiles and the chemical weapons, if he takes them out, fine ; but this embargo blockade- now, this Harvard report says something like 150,000 children are going to die if they do n't get in the proper equipment to clean up the sewage and the rest of it. They 're catching cholera and various diseases and another report says 80 children are dying each day and Mr. Bush said the embargo will not get him out of Kuwait, we have to go to war. What makes us think the embargo is going to get him out of power and what are these- how are these kids supposed to do that? Mr. SPECTOR : I think the answer is going to be not to lift the embargo as such but maybe to get humanitarian aid in where it 's needed with the appropriate Red Cross workers and the rest to make sure that some of these worst case things we 've been discussing do n't occur, but it is important for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deprive Saddam of cash so that he can spend it on other things apart from humanitarian assistance @!BUCHANAN But if we got- KINSLEY : Let- BUCHANAN : Excuse me, go ahead. Amb @!PECK Well, you know, I 'm concerned because President Bush said repeatedly during the buildup to the war and the war that we had nothing against the Iraqi people, it was the misguided leadership, but now we 're leaving this embargo in and the results are affecting not necessarily the leadership, but the people ; and we keep saying, as long as those people are still your leaders, you 're going to suffer this way ; but you know, if the Iraqi people could find some way to get rid of him, they would have done so long ago. All we 're doing is sticking it to them, if you will @!KINSLEY But look- Amb @!PECK And they 're left with this guy on top @!KINSLEY If your concern is to get rid of these sanctions, this embargo which is causing suffering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that also dictate that we ought to solve the problem quickly rather than at our leisure and not let it go on and on and on ; and if it could be solved quickly- if this issue, which is one of the things that bothers people most about the situation in Iraq, his potential future for these dangerous weapons, could be eliminated expeditiously, that would be one more reason not to have to keep the sanctions going. Amb @!PECK Yeah, but the sanctions are not for that. The sanctions are aimed against him and it 's the poor people who ca n't do anything about him who are suffering. I mean, it 's not easy to overthrow that kind of a leader @!KINSLEY No, but if he was certifiably no longer a military threat, certainly there would be one less reason to keep those sanctions on, would n't it? Amb @!PECK Yes, I suppose that 's true but I wonder when he 's no longer going to be certifiably a threat. Certainly on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- Mr. SPECTOR : There 's no air force @!BUCHANAN Except his own domestic minorities. Amb @!PECK Oh, yeah, he 's a threat to people inside the country. Mr. SPECTOR : But that 's how the resolution is set up. Once you eliminate all these weapons of mass destruction, the sanctions come off so I mean that's- everybody agrees that this is the way to go about it. I mean, this would be the quid pro quo if you could get the military threat eliminated, and then go back to the- BUCHANAN : Let me go to the question I was going to ask you. Is now would you say, as of today, is Iraq closer to a nuclear weapon or Iran? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I still have to say that it 's Iraq because we do n't have everything out. They were acquiring a lot of equipment before the war started and presumably most of that equipment still exists. I mean, we may have bombed sites but we know they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting a program, but I do n't they 've gotten very far @!BUCHANAN Are we going to have to bomb that, too? Mr. SPECTOR : Hopefully you wo n't have to if you can keep Iraq down, maybe Iran will not be so anxious to move its program forward and maybe it will be more susceptible to export controls than Iraq was @!KINSLEY OK. We 'll take a break. When we come back, maybe we 'll talk about what countries we may have to bomb in the coming decades in order to make sure that nuclear proliferation does n't happen. Commercial break ROWLAND EVANS, ' Evans and Novak ' : Why on earth, why in the world would Saddam Hussein try to conceal his nuclear weapons capability from us and the rest of the world? LAWRENCE EAGLEBURGER, Deputy Secretary of State : He has not shown a great deal of intelligence in the past and I think he stupidly thought he could get away with this. He ca n't @!KINSLEY Mr. Spector, I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're Washington 's leading expert on the general question of nuclear proliferation. There 's been a lot of talk, there 's been a lot of conferences, there 's been a lot of negotiating, there 's a treaty. In the end, is there any way to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons short of and at least implicit commitment by the United States or the U.N. or some military force to take military action against any country that attempts to go nuclear outside of the current nuclear club? Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I think there 's plenty to do before you would really think about that. There are plenty of diplomatic measures and we do have the nonproliferation treaty and so forth. I think you have to take this case by case. One example that we are seeing now which is pretty extraordinary is that South Africa which has had a capability to build nuclear weapons for a decade is going to join the nonproliferation treaty and put everything under inspection. Now, there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good enough and all the rest but the fact is that this seems to have been a case of a country turning around @!KINSLEY And what made them do that? BUCHANAN : The prospect of Nelson Mandela running the show. Mr. SPECTOR : Well, I think what they 're claiming and I think it 's certainly partly true is that you 've gotten any kind of communist influence out of southern Africa, out of Angola, the Cuban troops are gone, and things are a lot quieter at home then they were going to be some thought, and I think that was a big factor @!KINSLEY Is n't the most effective bit of nuclear nonproliferation of the past decade the taking out of that Iraqi reactor by the Israelis in-when was it-1982? BUCHANAN : Or 1981 @!KINSLEY And do n't we want to thank goodness in retrospect that we put Saddam 's nuclear program back at least a decade or whatever by then? Amb @!PECK That 's probably- that 's the upside as you see if you think he was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in that part of the world when you do something like that to a country in the Middle East which is after all an area of the Old Testament, leaving aside whether you 're Christian, Jew, a Sidi, Muslim, Sabean. If you stick your finger in somebody 's eye that deeply as the Israelis did to Iraq in 1981, it 's not forgotten @!KINSLEY You 're not saying Iraq would have been friends with the state of Israel if they had n't taken out that nuclear reactor? Amb @!PECK By no means, but that was a pretty harsh thing. It was very effectively done, it was a classic Israeli strike, but the Iraqi people and their government do n't forget that kind of thing. That 's a bleeding wound to this day @!KINSLEY All right. Well, on that note we have to end it. Thank you, Ambassador Peck. Thank you, Mr. Spector. Pat and I will proliferate in a moment. Commercial break BUCHANAN : Michael, six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran, India, Pakistan, Iraq, maybe Libya, are all working on their little projects. Why is it our problem and our responsibility to bomb them if they go ahead with them? KINSLEY : When only the United States and the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons, that was a little bit scary, two countries. Six countries, all except one democracies, that was a little bit scarier. When these third world countries start getting it with unstable governments and feuds that go way back and are uncontrolled, that 's extremely scary for the whole world @!BUCHANAN I know, but you 're not answering my question. Why is it the problem of the United States which is in the Western Hemisphere and in North America to be worried about whether the Paks are building the bomb- KINSLEY : You would n't worry about Pakistan dropping a bomb on India, a nuclear bomb on India? BUCHANAN : I think - KINSLEY : That would n't bother you? BUCHANAN : I think it should be India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of our problems. From the left, I 'm Mike Kinsley. Good night for Crossfire @!BUCHANAN From the right, Pat Buchanan.
