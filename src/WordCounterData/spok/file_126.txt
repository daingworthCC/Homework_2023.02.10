242141 @!FORREST-SAWYER : voice-over Reporters on the front line, in World War II and in Vietnam. But today, in the Persian Gulf, it 's not quite the same. BOB SIMON, CBS News : It 's not like in Vietnam where you could ride a road and- or just hop on a helicopter and come across what you came across. DEBORAH AMOS, National Public Radio : It 's pool journalism. It does n't give an accurate picture of the military @!SAWYER Good evening. I 'm Forrest Sawyer in Saudi Arabia, and this is Nightline. MILITARY PERSON : I said I do n't want to be photographed while I 'm talking to her @!SAWYER voice-over Are reporters covering the military build-up in the gulf getting the real story. And if not, why not? Security or PR? We 'll look at relations between the media and the military in the desert tonight @!ANNOUNCER This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from Saudi Arabia, Forrest Sawyer @!SAWYER The military build-up here in Saudi Arabia has not only been the most rapid in history, it has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists here, taking thousands of pictures, writing millions of words. Military commanders have announced a policy of complete cooperation with the press and assigned dozens of information officers to handle requests for information. It is simply unprecedented. But for all of that, are you really getting an accurate picture of what 's going on? Many reporters say no. The U.S. military, they claim, is waging a public relations campaign, keeping real problems and mistakes out of sight and the public in the dark. Which raises an important question. When does the critical need for operational security outweigh the public 's right to know? First, ABC 's John Lawrence. JOHN LAWRENCE, ABC News : voice-over America is getting ready to go to war with the most sophisticated fighting machine in military history, a trillion dollars of new hardware to try out and a public relations apparatus to match. 1st ARMY PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER : Roger. Let me know when you launch, that I can key the photographers. HELICOPTER PILOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army 's Apaches was staged for a selected group of journalists last weekend, to show how well the helicopters are surviving in the desert sand. 2nd ARMY PAO : Land with nose towards the east. Just try to keep the nose of your aircraft pointed at us. That 's the best shot @!LAWRENCE voice-over Getting the " best shot " for the photographers helps get positive publicity for a story the Army wants told @!PHOTOGRAPHER Turn towards each other a little bit, that 's great @!LAWRENCE voice-over The only problem with this kind of news coverage is- DEBORAH AMOS, National Public Radio : It 's not journalism. It 's simply not. It 's pool journalism. It does n't give an accurate picture of the military, and I think it 's a bit of a disservice, certainly to the public who wants to know what 's going on out here. CHRIS BURY, ABC News : I think it 's clearly just public relations. They want to put the best face on the U.S. military, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in preparations for war, not everything goes exactly according to plan. There have been a lot of snafus, and they do n't want those shown @!LAWRENCE voice-over The director of the military 's public affairs office here- Capt. MICHAEL SHERMAN, U.S.N., Director, Joint Information Bureau : Carry on, carry on, stop it @!LAWRENCE -is Captain Mike Sherman, U.S. Navy- Capt @!SHERMAN Is this for the TV cameras? LAWRENCE : voice-over -affectionately known by both reporters and his staff as " Hollywood Mike. " Capt @!SHERMAN And I 've told them you guys are going to be responsible for your charges, if you will @!LAWRENCE voice-over Before he volunteered to come here, Captain Sherman acted as the military liaison with the motion picture industry in Los Angeles. Capt @!SHERMAN You know, everybody is trying to do the best job that they possibly can to insure that the ground rules are adhered to, that somebody does n't say something that 's embarrassing for America, for their units, you know. In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public or to the news media, it 's just a case of people trying to do their job @!LAWRENCE voice-over On paper, the system is simple. A reporter fills out a form requesting permission to cover a specific story. The form then goes into the public affairs bureaucracy for approval or denial, while the reporter waits, sometimes for weeks, for an answer. Ms. AMOS : Last week I was annoyed enough to write one that said, " I have no access. I want to go see anything in the Army. I simply have n't seen them since I 've been here. " BOB SIMON, CBS News : It 's not like in Vietnam where you could ride a road and- or just hop on a helicopter and come across what you came across. You can only go to a unit with the information officers. It has to be set up in advance, it has to be approved. They 're always around when you do interviews. Very highly controlled situation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here, we 're facilitators, you know, and if anybody thinks that we 're controllers, then they 're wrong. I 'm here to insure that the operational security is preserved and that 's what I 'm here to do. And that's- other than that, to make sure you guys can get in without getting shot and get out without getting shot @!LAWRENCE voice-over By that definition, Captain Sherman has done his job with distinction. No reporters have been shot. But many of them feel they have been manipulated, misled, muzzled, scolded and even censored. Here 's what happened during an interview when an information officer did n't like the question @!REPORTER If you do get into combat conditions, would the civilians be expected to stay in the field with you? 3rd ARMY PAO : Speculation. ARMY OFFICER : Every one of them that I 've talked to, you know- 3rd ARMY PAO : Hold on a second @!LAWRENCE voice-over The public affairs officer objects that the question calls for speculation, but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMY PAO : You want to talk about this? REPORTER : Yes. 3rd ARMY PAO : Come over here @!REPORTER I 'm staying here. My point is that if you interrupt during an interview while it 's going on because you do n't like the question- 3rd ARMY PAO : I did n't know the- and I 'm trying to tell you is, I do n't know that I do n't like the question, I 'm simply saying that speculation was being asked for. We do n't, as a normal course of action, speculate on things that we do n't know about necessarily, if we do n't have the specific answer that you 're asking for @!LAWRENCE voice-over What is happening here is that a pattern appears to be emerging. MILITARY PERSON : I said I do n't want to be photographed while I 'm talking to her @!LAWRENCE voice-over G.I.s are allowed to pray in the field, but not to talk about it. ENLISTED MAN : I still have my beliefs, and my beliefs- 4th ARMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. I really ca n't let this stuff go out @!LAWRENCE voice-over Women work in the heat in light clothing, but when a camera appears, presto! ENLISTED WOMAN ; You 're telling me, it 's hot out here @!LAWRENCE voice-over Marines wear mostly what they see fit in the field, but if the public affairs officer thinks it 's too casual, the bandanna disappears, only to be returned to its place a little later. Ms. AMOS : In situations in the field, you will have officers say, " You ca n't ask that, we ca n't discuss that. " Now, I think all of us understand you ca n't talk about numbers and you ca n't talk about locations. I 'm perfectly comfortable with that, and I understand exactly why. But a lot of times I feel it 's arbitrary. They do n't feel like doing something, so they say, " Oh, we ca n't talk about that, that 's security. " And sometimes I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs system has been strained to its limits by the hundreds of reporters and photographers trying to get out into the field to get a story. But so many field trips have been promised and then canceled, or started and then scrubbed, that journalists question the competence of their escorts. Mr. SIMON : These guys very often ca n't find anything. A lot of the trips they organize, we end up dubbing " trips to nowhere, " " trips to hell. " They do n't have maps, they do n't have compasses, they would n't know how to read them if they had them. They miss turns. They wo n't tell us where they 're going, so we ca n't help. We ended up, after a six-hour drive last week, we ended up at a base, and we wanted to get on to the base to ask where we were, and the information officer could n't get onto the base because he did n't know the password. I thought the password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time @!LAWRENCE voice- over Reporters and public affairs officers are trying to do their jobs in conditions that lead logically to conflict between journalists ' need to know and the military 's need for security. It is rarely resolved to either side 's satisfaction. John Lawrence for Nightline, Saudi Arabia @!SAWYER And, when we come back, we will be joined by two veteran war correspondents covering the military build-up here in Saudi Arabia, Patrick Sloyan of Newsday and Richard Pyle of the Associated Press, and by U.S. Navy Captain Michael Sherman, the chief U.S. information officer in eastern Saudi Arabia. Commercial break SAWYER : Joining us from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where it is very early in the morning now, are two journalists whose experience includes the Vietnam war and numerous military conflicts in the Middle East, Patrick Sloyan, senior correspondent for the New York newspaper, Newsday and Richard Pyle of the Associated Press. Also with us from Dhahran is Captain Michael Sherman of the U.S. Navy. He is director of the U.S. military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia. Captain Sherman, let me tell it to you bluntly. There appear to be quite a number of people in the press corps who believe that it is this administration 's goal, the Pentagon 's goal, to have a tightly controlled press, and that part of your mission is to keep an eye on the press and to make sure they do n't wander off the reservation too far and get into trouble. Is that true? Capt. MICHAEL SHERMAN, USN, Director, Joint Information Bureau : My job here is to provide maximum access to the military, consistent within the ground rules that have been set forth for operational security. That 's simply what we 're trying to do here @!SAWYER Well, what they say- now, you 've heard it, Mike, you 've heard it from people- Capt @!SHERMAN I 've heard it @!SAWYER -who have come up to you and said, " I ca n't go out on operations, I want to go out to the field and talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the problem? " Now, that ca n't be maximum availability. Capt @!SHERMAN Well, what- you know- well, Forrest, we 've had- I 've had over 1,700 newsmen go out into the field. We 're averaging about 10 newsmen per trip on three trips a day. I 've had men out in the Gulf of Oman with the amphibious ships, I 've had them out on the Independence a number of times, out on the U.S.S. Wisconsin a number of times, out on the small destroyers, the frigates out in the Gulf. They 've been on the Comfort, they 've been on the Mercy, they 've been everywhere in the eastern province here in Saudi Arabia. I quite honestly do n't know how much more access we can give them other than they would like to stay longer out in the field. We 're trying to accomplish that, but right now you have to realize that we 've done all this within the context of the biggest and largest build-up, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our primary goal here being the defense of Saudi Arabia. I think we 've accomplished that, I think we 've provided access as much as possible within those ground rules and within those goals. That 's what we 're trying to do. I- SAWYER : All right. Pat Sloyan of Newsday- Capt @!SHERMAN -because- SAWYER : -hold on a second, Captain Sherman. Let me bring Pat Sloyan of Newsday in here. Capt @!SHERMAN Right @!SAWYER There 's the point he 's trying to make. We 've never seen anything like this before, Pat. We have n't seen this kind of build- up, we have n't seen hundreds of journalists descend in this way. It 's been built from the ground up and if there are some problems, you have to expect it. Is that fair? PATRICK SLOYAN, Senior Correspondent, " Newsday " : Well, I do, but I do expect the military to facilitate my requests for access to the troops. Captain Sherman, his staff here has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave up on them helping me. I only had one simple request. Most of the Army troops here are operating, training at night. I wanted to see a night maneuver, a night operation. I gave up on any help from these fellows, and started interviewing individual reporters around this country who are willing to talk about it, provide the kind of details I need. But if you spend any time here waiting for Captain Sherman or his staff to facilitate or accommodate you in any way, it 's a waste of time. Capt @!SHERMAN Well, I do n't think so, Pat @!SAWYER You- Capt @!SHERMAN And I told- when Pat- let me- let me say, Forrest, when Pat showed up two weeks ago, by the way- Mr. SLOYAN : Try three. Try three. Capt @!SHERMAN -no, three weeks down- you were down in Riyadh for a week, Pat, then you came up here and showed up two weeks ago- Mr. SLOYAN : Yeah, I understand. Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me, " Mike, the only thing I want to do is night vision goggles, " and I said, " Pat, I 've got about 50 or 60 people waiting to go out overnight. " And I told you, " I 'll try to accommodate you as quickly as I can. " Meanwhile, we 've got people out, I have had 20- I 've had 20 people out last night with the Marines doing night vision training and all the rest of it. You simply have n't made it- SAWYER : All right- Capt @!SHERMAN -to the top of the list, and I 'm not going to jump you up there. Mr. SLOYAN : No, I do n't think it 's that. I think that- I did n't want to go out with the Marines, I wanted to go out with the Army. I think there 's about three or four- SAWYER : -all right, Pat, hold on a second. Mr. SLOYAN : -yeah @!SAWYER Pat, hold on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. What I think I heard you say early on was the word roadblock, and should I infer from that that you believe that there is a kind of policy here whereby the press is obstructed from pursuing certain kinds of information? Mr. SLOYAN : Yes, I think it 's a policy. It emanates from Richard Cheney, the secretary of defense, and Pete Williams, his aide. This is a continuation of efforts to manipulate " spin, " get us to do things their way. I mean, they did it in Panama, they blocked any coverage of the war down there, despite elaborate promises they were going to give us access. If anything happens here, I think they 're going to try to manipulate, maneuver, block us from doing our job. Capt @!SHERMAN That 's absolutely ridiculous. I have n't received one iota of guidance in terms of blockage from anybody in Washington, D.C. They 've been absolutely satisfied with the coverage, as far as I 'm concerned. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was n't shown and I did n't get to see in that opening piece, Forrest, was the hundreds of news media that have come to us thanking us for our assistance. The major story that Molly Moore did in The Washington Post telling everybody how- what a remarkable job we 've been doing here. And then for somebody to show up two weeks- SAWYER : Captain Sherman, before we go to commercial, let me bring in one person we have n't heard from, and that 's Richard Pyle of the Associated Press, who has covered quite a number of conflicts, and you 've covered the military for a couple of decades, Richard. What do you think? Is there a conspiracy, if you want to call it that, or is it just a little confusion? RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press : There 's no conspiracy here. I 've been here for a little over two months, Forrest, and what I see is a lot of confusion that I think results mainly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you say it 's unprecedented, it certainly is. There 's 600-some reporters in this country, in a country that 's never had that many probably in its whole history. And everybody 's trying to go out and cover a war that has n't happened yet. You 've got the tanks, you 've got the troops, you 've got the ships and everything else here. Everybody 's waiting for something to happen and it has n't happened yet. In the meantime, you have a lot of demands being made that the military 's trying to fulfill, and they 're not fully up to this job. But I do n't think we have to see a conspiracy here where none exists and I frankly do n't think there is one. What I 'm worried about is what happens when the shooting starts, not what 's going on now @!SAWYER And that 's where we 're going to stop this right now. We 're going to come back and answer that question, Richard. All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens then? We 'll talk about that in just a moment. Three hundred and three journalists from 161 news organizations are currently reporting from Saudi Arabia. Commercial break SAWYER : Our topic, covering the Gulf crisis and the problems in bringing you information that you need to know. Richard Pyle of the Associated Press, you said your concern is what happens if fighting does break out. What are you worried about? Mr. PYLE : Well, first of all, Forrest, I think we have to make it clear at the start that none of us consider the media pool system the ideal way to cover a war or anything else, but we have to live with that. And so, under those circumstances, we 're faced with having to do things pretty much the military 's way. I can deal with that in the field, but what I 'm really concerned about is if we 're going to get some- another Panama. That 's the worst possible case that we could have here, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert equivalent of a golf course in Panama and stuck there while the fighting is going on someplace else. And if they intend to do that, that 's going to be unfortunate all over again. I personally do n't see this happening right now and, based on some information that I 've gotten in the last couple of days, I'm- I do n't think at this time that that 's what they intend to do, but that does n't mean that we can rule that out @!SAWYER Captain Sherman, with the benefit of hindsight, I think the military acknowledges that maybe there was a little too much concern about security and not enough press access in Panama. Are you solving that problem here? Capt @!SHERMAN I can't- well, we 're trying to. I was n't in Panama, I do n't know. I 'm running things the way that I think it should be run and that is that we provide you as much access as possible. We sat down with Richard just the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feelings about it. He knows that I 'm going to try within everything possible in my means to get these news media out and get them up to the front so that they can cover the hostilities. It 's the only way to do it. It 's the only way that this country works, so that you can see how it goes @!SAWYER Well, now, how are you going to do that- Capt @!SHERMAN That 's definitely crosstalk @!SAWYER -how are you going to do it, Captain Sherman? Let us say that hostilities do break out. Capt @!SHERMAN Well, what we 're looking at now is trying to get news media pools set up so that we can get them out with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and so that they will be with the military the entire time, for the rest of- the duration of this operation, no matter how it culminates. We do n't know if that 'll work, we 're looking into it. I think it 's the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there, you 're living with the troops, you 're covering them and you 're getting to know them and their problems and the logistics, and I think that 's about the only way to do it. We have a team in country right now that 's come in from the Department of Defense, because both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Williams are very concerned about this and they are here now looking- SAWYER : Captain, you say that 's the only way to do it, but in World War II you did n't have to have pools. In Vietnam you did n't have to have pools. And we had very good coverage. Capt @!SHERMAN Well, but- the logistics are incredible out here. This desert is as bad as trying to put you out on an ocean and trying to find one ship in 100,000 square miles. Yes, we 've gotten lost, which you alluded to earlier in the program. We were lost in a helicopter just- some of us officers the other day, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were located. It 's a horrendous area to try to work in, the logistics are terrible, the heat is terrible, all the rest of it works against you. So what we 've got to do, we 've got to get out there, we 've got to get you guys in place, we 've got to practice our logistics, you have to practice your logistics. We have to figure out how to get all this thing working and we have to it very fast. That 's why there 's a team in here from Mr. Cheney @!SAWYER I should clarify that when we say " pool coverage, " what we actually mean is that one or two reporters, a team, a small team, will go out and then report back for all the media, and everybody would have access to that information. Patrick Sloyan, is that an effective way to go about this? Mr. SLOYAN : Well, they promised us coverage in Panama. I think we 've seen a trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It started in Grenada. They arrested our reporter down there, put him on a command ship for two days, would n't let him file. Panama, the reporters, the special pool that went down to cover it, they saw absolutely nothing. They came in late and then they were put in a position where the only thing they could see was a CNN briefing from Washington. Now they 're making promises here. I think the after-action report in Panama showed the secretary of defense deliberately cutting us out. There are no photographs of American soldiers in combat in Panama. And I think they try to minimize the actual reality of battle in these situations. I do n't trust this administration for one minute in facilitating our coverage of a war, if it comes to that here @!SAWYER Captain Sherman, is there a feeling, a kind of residue of bitterness about Vietnam, a worry that if the reality and the horror of war is actually shown on the television screens back home, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erode rather quickly? Capt @!SHERMAN Now, Forrest, that 's two questions. Is there a residue- I do n't think there is anymore. I think that we 've gotten through that at this point. I think that we 're trying to communicate, we 're trying to work together, at least I thought we were until Pat got on the show, but I do n't know what we 're doing. In terms of the other aspect of it, we 're just going to do the best we can and try to provide as much information as we can to the general public, to the- you know, to the public within the security constraints and the operational constraints of this thing @!SAWYER No, but is there a concern that if you show the horrors of war that there might actually be a loss of public confidence? Capt @!SHERMAN I want you to know that the horrors of war are something that you ought to all see, because we 're the ones that have to get shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. Those of us who do so do n't want to. So as long as everybody in this world can see how terrible and horrible a war is, then I think that 's something that is going to stop them from happening. So, can we document them? Yes, we absolutely should document them. There are ways and means of documenting them and that 's what I think we have to work out together. Mr. PYLE : Forrest, can I make a point- SAWYER : Gentlemen, that's- I 'm afraid you ca n't, sir, we 're right out of time, but forgive me, we 're going to have to leave it there. I thank all three of you for joining us tonight. We 'll be back in just a moment. Commercial break SAWYER : Tomorrow night, another edition of Nightline from here in the Gulf, but that 's our report for tonight. I 'm Forrest Sawyer from somewhere in Saudi Arabia- military regulations do n't permit us to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC News, good night.
