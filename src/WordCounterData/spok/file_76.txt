232841 CHARLES OSGOOD, host : Christmas morning is an especially wonderful time for children, a lovely dream come true. And at some point this evening, after the gifts have all been opened, the wrapping paper and ribbons put away and the toys all played with, each child eventually will go to bed, and it is then the sandman will come. The dreams of childhood are the business of the sandman, the fanciful creation of a grown-up author and artist who turns the ordinary artifacts of daily life into the stuff dreams are made of. Martha Teichner takes us now on a voyage with the sandman. @(Footage-of-childre) @!Mr-DEAN-MORRISSEY- : @(Voiceover) ' I 'll bet he wears a robe and slippers, and has a long white beard. I wonder how he carries all that sleeping sand around. If I was the sandman, I 'd take the Red Rocket. The Red Rocket was Joey 's wagon. He 'd been riding it all afternoon. ' @!MARTHA-TEICHNER-re : qwq @( Visual-of-illustra @(Voiceover) This is a story about a story, an old-fashioned story in which a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the sandman. @(Footage-of-childre) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) ' Joey wondered how he could make his wagon fly and what he would need to bring along -- a map, a box of animal crackers, some string and a chocolate bar, some grapes and an apple, a compass, an extra chocolate bar, my baseball cap, an orange, my blanket and pillow, a chocolate bar... ' @(Visual-of-illustra) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) So provisioned, Joey soon finds himself aboard the " Ship Of Dreams. " The name suggests a sleek, tall, ethereal vessel, but that is not at all what children 's author Dean Morrissey had in mind. In the fantasy world he has undertaken to reinvent, the Ship Of Dreams is stout and battered, and the sandman is a guy with a regular job. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : The sandman I think of as a very workmanlike character, and so I thought in order for him to haul what he has to haul, which is enough sleeping sand to put the entire world to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would handle the job. And so what came to mind immediately were the tugboats and the workboats. And this is the place... @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) What Dean Morrissey sees every day, living on Cape Cod, was his inspiration. @(Sights-from-Cape-C) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) One of the great things about the workboats, when you picture them from an aesthetic standpoint, there 's all this stuff that 's hanging off of them. It 's usually tires and fishing boats with all kind of nets and... @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) What is so singular about Dean Morrissey 's art is how he transforms all that stuff. The sandman 's working gear, hanging off his " Ship Of Dreams, " is like no other. @(Visual-of-illustra) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : So what I had in mind was, sort of metaphorically, the sea of time separating the world that we know from the world of imagination. So I kind of use it that way. And what visually came to mind was this -- roughly this location. But coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of this place fairly well. @(Footage-from-Cape-) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Nearly 200 feet high, with gears and counterweights like a giant cuckoo clock, the railroad bridge over Cape Cod Canal satisfies Dean Morrissey 's love for anachronistic-looking contraptions. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : I think that, technologically, I stop somewhere around the industrial revolution, is what I -- and maybe I go up ask far as the internal combustion engine, but that 's absolutely it. And so this is technology that I can sort of comprehend, and I think there 's something very appealing about that. What I paint are absurd takeoffs on that. It 's sort of non-technology, anti-technology, but I find that this kind of thing has a great deal of humanity to it. It 's a beauty, is n't it? @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) If there were such a thing as an idea store, for Dean this would be it. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : But $ 22 is a good price. This is in beautiful shape. That 's unbelievable! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife Shan somewhat unsystematically scour this indoor flea market, a kind of final resting place for obsolete technology. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : Oh, look at this, too. @!SHAN-@1Dean's-Wife : Oh, that 's beautiful. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : We did n't know it did that. It 's a stereoscopic, electric X-ray adjuster. @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) It creates a certain atmosphere when you 're around these things that lends itself. It 's conducive to building the absurd thing, you know. And that 's what my job in life, evidently, is to build that. @(Visual-of-illustra) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) The real objects that capture Dean 's imagination never come out quite the way they went in. For example, when was the last time you saw one of these? No, it 's not a locomotive. It 's from an upcoming book about Father Time. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : Well, the little girl is standing in here and she 's about to be projected through time. @!SHAN : These are the reels of films. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film of life. That 's right. @!SHAN : Oh, the film of life. OK. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : Time projection is a very funny business. @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) What amounts to thinking like a kid for a living has not always been Dean Morrissey 's career. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) I took construction jobs from the time I was 20. I did n't go to art school. I did all kinds of things. And I guess I was about 27, and I was drawing and painting at night and working as a lineman for the power company all day. And something had to go, so I gave up the day job and just set out. @!OK-Let's-imagine-i# @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Now when Dean goes on book tours, part of what he does is teach kids to think of themselves as artists. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : I had a boy tell me the other day that I drew a hairy-looking circle. @(Footage-of-childre) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) Art is something that is perceived by a lot of people as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people. Very nice. You really draw well. @(Footage-of-childre) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) I just try to make the statement that that is n't necessarily the case, that if this is what you love to do, then you very much belong there. ' Joey turned and looked into the open hatchway on the deck. He could see that the ship 's hold was filled with sparkling, golden sand. " Sand, " he thought, " Sand. " Wait a minute : the beard, the robe -- Joey turned and looked up at the old fellow. " You, you 're the sandman. " ' @(Visual-of-illustra) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Close up, it so happens that the sandman looks like an older version of Dean Morrissey. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) ' " Wow, it is you. Just like I imagined. " ' @(Visual-of-illustra) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) The sandman is a character who I see as the essence of consistency. He 's there for every child every night, no exceptions. He does n't call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very selfless person, a very compassionate fellow. And what he basically is, is he was someone who I wish I was. @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) I would like that my son should think so well of me as -- as to think I had some of those qualities, you know? @!SHAN : Yea! Go back to Daddy. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : I 'm glad you came today. Hope you enjoyed the book. @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) " Ship Of Dreams " is the first of what Dean sees as a series of stories intended to do what fables and myths have always done : Teach children about fundamental human ideals. @!Mr-MORRISSEY : Keep up the good work. It 's really great. @(Footage-of-Morriss) @!Mr-MORRISSEY : @(Voiceover) These stories will represent a universe where people have -- among other things, have a great deal of respect for each other. And I 'll restate that over and over and over again. It seems like a natural thing to want to say, and I -- and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to my son. There you go, Bennett. Thanks. @(Visual-of-illustra) @!TEICHNER : @(Voiceover) Every time a child is born, the sandman makes a new star and hangs it in the sky. ' Through stardust and comets and wind and bad weather, ' he says, ' This star that I hang in the sky, stay forever. ' And that 's just part of his job.
