242041 @!FORREST-SAWYER : voice-over Panic food buying sweeps Moscow, more than 20 people killed in clashes between the Red Army and militant nationalists in Soviet Armenia and the growing challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev 's political supremacy. As the Soviet president prepares for the summit in Washington, we 'll focus tonight on the threats to his leadership at home @!ANNOUNCER This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from Washington, Forrest Sawyer @!SAWYER It is likely that, when Mikhail Gorbachev visits the U.S. in a couple of days, he 'll be greeted with far more enthusiasm than he could ever find back home. He is, after all, still a marvel to behold in the West, the very architect of Communist reform. But in the Soviet Union, that architecture is quaking at its foundation. Parts of the Soviet empire have deserted ; others are waiting their turn. Workers go out on strike while consumers seem to believe his economic reform only means more hardship, and once-fearful politicians now openly defy him. Can Gorbachev continue to build his new system, or are events beginning to spiral out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union with Nightline correspondent Jackie Judd. JACKIE JUDD, ABC News : voice-over These are the images Mikhail Gorbachev faced on the eve of his summit departure, Soviets fighting over food, his chief antagonist fighting for political prominence, and killings in the independence-minded republic of Armenia. This is what the railway station at the capital, Yerevan, looked like, after Armenian militants and Soviet troops clashed. Each side accused the other of firing first. The doctor says : " I came to the station and saw bodies lying all over the floor, and soldiers standing in the corner. I wanted to help, but they were all dead. They were all riddled with bullets. " Six Armenians died at the station ; other clashes followed on the streets between roving gangs and government troops. In all, about 20 people were killed, and many others were hurt. And Gorbachev probably suffered some political wounds as well. GEORGE SCHOPFLIN, London School of Economics : The fact that this, too, has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an added embarrassment for Gorbachev @!JUDD voice-over Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan have been warring for some time over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated largely by Armenians but inside of and controlled by Azerbaijan. This latest trouble began the day before Armenia 's commemoration of its brief independence some 70 years ago. The rally went on today, subdued and mournful, and not a trigger for more violence, as some had feared. In Moscow today, the people 's economic misery deepened. As it does every day, the 12:33 train from Malayaroslavitz arrived in the city, filled with Soviets who traveled over 100 miles in search of food. They come from where the shelves are almost bare, and what 's left is n't worth buying. They come to the capital with empty baskets, expecting to fill them. But not today, not in Moscow. Today you had to prove you lived in the city to buy in it. through interpreter 1st SOVIET WOMAN : Can I get a bottle of milk here? SOVIET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of milk. SOVIET STOREKEEPER : We 're checking documents. 1st SOVIET WOMAN : Good Lord @!JUDD voice-over And because she does n't have the right passport, she 's turned away from the state-owned store. Some three million other people face the same predicament. And they 're fighting for meager rations. Panic buying swept the city over the weekend by shoppers anxious about price increases due July 1st for bread and grain products. A manager warns people that today they can not hoard, and that they must show their passports again to the cashier. And then she adds they should n't panic. on camera Soviet citizens heard much the same message last night from Gorbachev in a nationwide televised address. " Do n't panic, remain calm, " he said. But for those who came here today to go shopping, his words were meaningless. voice-over The passport requirement set off a kind of fury. People already pushed to the limit feel pushed beyond it. 2nd SOVIET WOMAN : through interpreter " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ca n't eat, ca n't come and get food to eat. What about this boy? What is he supposed to do, put out his hand and ask? That 's what Gorbachev is doing. Is it right, what our president is doing? " JUDD : voice-over And dangerously, the law set Soviet against Soviet. Nationalist feelings, already stirred up in the Russian federation, boiled over. 3rd SOVIET WOMAN : through interpreter You come from all over to Moscow and buy up everything. And look at your nationality, you 're not even Russian. Go back where you live and put your own house in order. 4th SOVIET WOMAN : through interpreter We also live in the Soviet Union. You do n't know anything about anything. I have eight kids. I come here to get something done @!JUDD voice-over It is precisely these nationalist feelings that politician Boris Yeltsin exploits, and Gorbachev fears. Yeltsin is struggling to become president of Russia. He failed twice last week to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy session today, Yeltsin was renominated, and another election will be held tomorrow. Russia is the largest republic in the Soviet Union, and Yeltsin wants it to have greater autonomy. That demand, gaining favor among the people, is among the most serious challenges that Gorbachev faces. ARTYOM BOROVIK, Soviet Journalist : If Yeltsin is elected, and he 's a very strong personality, there will be a very strong government in Russia. And now, if you take into account all the republics trying to separate, to go away from the Soviet Union, it looks like the Russian government will be stronger than the Soviet Union government @!JUDD voice-over Yeltsin also ridicules Gorbachev 's perestroika, and he promises Russians what sounds like an economic miracle. Mr. SCHOPFLIN : He 's obviously saying, " Elect me and I will make sure that there will be no massive rise in prices, there will be no inflation, there will be plenty of goods. " In other words, a kind of " cloud cuckooland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appalling state of the Soviet economy @!JUDD Whether or not Yeltsin wins, his thorn-in-the-side candidacy, the economic crisis and ethnic violence all point out just how fragile a situation Gorbachev faces here at home, and how he seems unable to contain it. This is Jackie Judd for Nightline, in Moscow @!SAWYER Joining us when we come back, a top adviser to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Vitaly Churkin, Soviet radio and television commentator Joe Adamov, and Paul Quinn- Judge, Moscow correspondent for The Boston Globe. Commercial break SAWYER : Vitaly Churkin, who joins us tonight in our Washington bureau, is a close adviser to Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. Mr. Churkin has also served at the Soviet embassy in Washington and is currently here to help with preparations for the Bush-Gorbachev summit. With us from Moscow is Joe Adamov, a longtime commentator for Soviet radio and television. And with us from Ottawa, where Soviet President Gorbachev is due tomorrow en route to Washington, is Paul Quinn-Judge, Moscow correspondent for The Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow, let me begin with you. Listening to reports like Jackie 's, one has the sense that there is not only panic but a sense of desperation and despair and a feeling that things are very much out of control among the Soviet people. Is that an exaggeration, or is it that bad? JOE ADAMOV, Soviet Radio/TV Commentator : I 'm afraid it is a bit of an exaggeration. They 're not out of control. There is this run on consumer goods and on foodstuffs in the stores, that is absolutely correct. But I would n't say that there 's panic among the people. There 's panic buying, that, yes. And that 's only natural, because when the lower-paid brackets learn that there will be a price rise, naturally they run for everything in the stores. But Mr. Gorbachev tried to calm feelings and said that there 's no need to panic because the lower-paid brackets will be compensated. But of course, the situation is very grave indeed, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many of our top economists. They say there 's no such thing as a regulated economy, as a regulated market. It 's either- it 's a market economy or it 's the old autocratic system of economy where everything- SAWYER : But among the Soviet people, is there a feeling of frustration with Gorbachev himself, that he has taken things down the wrong road? Mr. ADAMOV : I do n't think there is much frustration. Of course, I would say that his ratings have dropped a bit lately, yes. But I believe that the majority of the people still believe in him as the only leader in the country capable of leading the country out of the very deep crisis that it 's in now. I think if he were to be- if he were to run at an open election in the country, I think he 'd get about 60 percent of the vote @!SAWYER Mr. Quinn-Judge, you 've been following this for some time and you have been talking privately to a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sense? PAUL QUINN-JUDGE, " The Boston Globe " : I do n't think one could use the word " panic " so much as despair. I think there 's a very strong sense that Gorbachev or the people around Gorbachev themselves feel they 're running out of time. Joe Adamov talked about elections. I think perhaps we 'll see elections soon where Gorbachev can prove this. But I do think there is a feeling among a lot of people now that they 're more willing or more interested in hearing what Boris Yeltsin and the new opposition is saying than Gorbachev. Gorbachev has said rather a lot in the past, and more and more people are listening not so much to what he 's saying, but waiting for actions, and nothing is coming @!SAWYER But privately, are the aides around Gorbachev expressing full support, full confidence that he 's going to be able to continue down the road of economic reform, or is there now concern that he might not be able to survive? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sense of resignation, I do not talk for all the aides around Gorbachev, but I think a lot of people inside the Soviet political establishment do feel that they 're running out of time, that what they 're doing right now is fighting a series of rear-guard battles and that there 's no sign of them making any major breakthrough at the moment. Gorbachev is losing the political initiative. He does n't show any sign at the moment of being able to regain it. Too many things are breaking loose in too many parts of the country @!SAWYER Mr. Churkin, that of course is you. You are one of those aides around Mr. Shevardnadze, you 're in a very critical position. Do you have a feeling that time is beginning to run out and unless you move a bit more quickly than you have, that things might turn against you? VITALY CHURKIN, Soviet Foreign Ministry : Well, fortunately I 'm not doing economy. I 'm doing international relations, which is much easier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nevertheless- nevertheless, one must say that the economy is a critical factor in the conduct of international relations. Mr. CHURKIN : Oh, yes it is, oh yes, it is. And I think- SAWYER : So you must worry about that. Mr. CHURKIN : -yes, of course. There is a contradiction. People are saying that Gorbachev should be moving faster, he is losing initiative. At the same time, he has done this modest step, moving towards a regulated market economy, and of course, one of the first consequences is that rise of prices. And immediately there is panic. Gorbachev has been trying to ensure that the change comes gradually and after a lot of preparation. He is for steady- steadiness in that change. So I do n't quite see how one can look for Yeltsin or other radical reformers, as they call themselves, looking for solutions. Because what they say they are going to do is going to cause more of that, and not less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, as a way out @!SAWYER But Mr. Churkin, do you see that if Mr. Yeltsin is elected in this third try that he 's going to deal a very serious blow to Mr. Gorbachev 's power? Mr. CHURKIN : No, I do n't think so. I think that first, inevitably, he is going to move more to the center if he is going to be elected, because this is what is happening- what happens, usually, to all politicians, especially those who get elected on populist slogans. And second, Mr. Yeltsin made it quite clear that if he is elected, he is certainly going to try to cooperate with Mr. Gorbachev. So I think that it may take time for them to get adjusted to each other, but I do n't see any tragedy about it @!SAWYER Well, if Mr. Yeltsin is elected, he would become, I suppose you might say the most- the second-most-powerful person in the Soviet Union behind Mr. Gorbachev. What could that mean? We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government poll shows that 56 percent of the Soviet people favor a limited market economy although 69 percent believe they would suffer because of it. Commercial break SAWYER : We are continuing our discussion with Vitaly Churkin, Joe Adamov and Paul Quinn- Judge. Mr. Quinn-Judge, to be blunt, there were those people who saw Boris Yeltsin not too long ago as a bit of a buffoon and something of a hard drinker, and now here he is challenging Gorbachev in a very serious way. How has he come to this so quickly? Mr. QUINN-JUDGE : Well, I think it has to be a reflection of a crisis in the system. People are irritated with the lack of change. Boris Yeltsin is somebody who is rejected by the old system, I think as Gorbachev must realize to his regret now. He essentially made Yeltsin into the dissident hero that he is now. I think Yeltsin is still very woolly. He may not be a buffoon, he may be a very good political fighter, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a disciplinarian reformer. Nobody really knows what he wants right now, but he is riding this tremendous wave of popularity, and that has to be a sign of a deep sense of distrust and lack of confidence in the present political leadership @!SAWYER Mr. Adamov, do you have a sense that he might be able to pull it off? Mr. ADAMOV : Yes, I think he might pull it off, although it 's very questionable. But I will say one thing. I just heard that things have not changed. I think economic-wise, things have become worse in the past five years. There 's no question about that. And Mr. Yeltsin promises no rise in prices, no unemployment. How he can go over to a free market economy without a rise in prices or without unemployment is a question, but I do n't think he 'll be able to do that. But generally speaking, his platform, which he has pronounced from the rostrum of our parliament, is very much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feeling, personally, that if he is elected, he will act as a catalyst and make Mr. Gorbachev more radical and make more radical steps in the economy. As for the support Mr. Yeltsin has, it 's overwhelming. He got 90 percent of the votes when he was elected to congress, and right now the deputies have got up, one after another, in the parliament of Russia proper and said that their electorate, 85, 90, one from Vladivostok on the Pacific said 98 percent of the electorate supports Yeltsin. In him they see a more radical change. He wants to give the farmers more freedom, he wants to give them land and the freedom to own their land and to dispose of the products as they see fit. He wants to give more freedom to the enterprises. So on the face of it, you see, the program sounds much more radical. I have a feeling if he is elected, he 'll sort of make Mr. Gorbachev speed things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the summit, and this is tomorrow morning 's Washington Post. You 'll notice the headline here, which says, " Soviets Dismantle Disputed Radar. " That is referring to the Krasnoyarsk radar station which has been in dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union for many years now. And it is being dismantled, I gather. Is that true? Mr. CHURKIN : Oh, yes. We promised some time ago that we are going to do that, and after some preparation, they started this work @!SAWYER Is that an indication that things are moving along well enough that Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush will be able to say that all the problems on strategic arms discussions are out of the way, as they hoped? Mr. CHURKIN : I think they are going to do that, yes @!SAWYER They are going to do that? Mr. CHURKIN : They are going to do that, yes @!SAWYER So we can say at this point that all the problems have been ironed out? Mr. CHURKIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few, very many, actually, smaller things which still need to be worked out, but other most difficult problems, I think, will have been settled by the time Mr. Gorbachev leaves Washington @!SAWYER Given the difficulties that Mr. Gorbachev is facing back at home, given the economic problems, given the tremendous rearrangement of Europe that we are witnessing, what does Mr. Gorbachev come wanting to take away? Mr. CHURKIN : Well, he is not going to take away anything. You are going to have- all we have as it is now. But basically, I think he is coming to Washington to talk with President Bush about the current state of the world. You have pointed out, quite accurately, that many things have changed, so the two leaders, I think, need to talk about those things and need to figure out where the two nations stand now and how they can work together in order to manage this current period of transition, in which we all find ourselves @!SAWYER Mr. Quinn-Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gorbachev really going to be laying a philosophical groundwork and not looking for anything specific? Mr. QUINN-JUDGE : I 'm not sure what he can look at to take back to Moscow right now. I think the situation in the Soviet Union is so grave, both politically and economically, that there 's nothing much- there 's no one piece of paper or one undertaking from Washington that he can bring back that will really help him. The only thing I think he can look for from this summit is to create a sense that everything is business as normal, at least as far as U.S.-Soviet relations are concerned. But his mind is going to have to be a lot on what 's going on in Moscow and in Armenia and in the Baltics. And that 's where his problems lie. Washington is very much a sideshow right now to a much bigger drama that 's going on inside the Soviet Union @!SAWYER Should the United States be doing more? Can it do more? We 'll talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform Plan, the price of a loaf of bread will increase 200 percent. Commercial break SAWYER : Mr. Churkin, the Soviet economy would benefit greatly by having most favored nation status bestowed upon it by the United States, but Mr. Bush has said that simply is not going to happen because of Lithuania and because of emigration problems. He has, however, given most favored nation status to the Chinese. Does that seem unfair to you? Mr. CHURKIN : No, I do n't want to make any comparisons here. It seems unhealthy that our two nations do not have normal economic relations. I think you are overestimating the import of that status in the short term. In the long term, of course, it 's necessary for our two nations to interact normally on the economic plane @!SAWYER Will Mr. Gorbachev try to change his mind at this summit, and have it given in a short time? Mr. CHURKIN : No, it 's the decision of the U.S. administration. Whenever they are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that @!SAWYER Mr. Quinn-Judge, is there a feeling among the Soviet Union that the United States ought to be doing more, at least to help economically? Mr. QUINN-JUDGE : I think it 's very hard to see what they could do right now. If there was a sort of Marshall Plan for the Soviet Union right now, that could be helpful. But the fundamental problem is that the political and the economic system is collapsing, and this is only something that only Gorbachev or only the Soviets can try to rectify. I do n't think much aid is going to make any difference either way or the other @!SAWYER Do you have a feeling, Paul, that Mr. Gorbachev is beginning to slip on the ice? Mr. QUINN-JUDGE : Yes, I 'm afraid I do. I hope he regains his posture, but I would n't want to bet on it right now @!SAWYER Mr. Adamov, there are those people in the Soviet Union who are saying : " Look, you people over there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to pay attention to the broader picture and not to the individual. " Do you have that feeling? Mr. ADAMOV : Well, I have a feeling that the people by and large are still behind Mr. Gorbachev, because they feel that he is the only real figure on the horizon, and I feel that the summit will strengthen his hand in foreign policy and thus improve his image at home @!SAWYER Joe Adamov, I thank you very much for joining us, Paul Quinn-Judge in Ottawa, thank you, and Vitaly Churkin, here in Washington for the summit which begins on Wednesday, our thanks to you. And of course, ABC News coverage with Peter Jennings will begin on Wednesday as well. And that is our report for tonight. I 'm Forrest Sawyer in Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.
