223541 @!THIS-IS-A-RUSH-TRA :( voice-over) Tonight, a family and a nation are once again united by tragedy. In the waters near his mother 's island home on Martha 's Vineyard, John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s plane crashed into the sea with his wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren onboard. The search that began early this morning along the northeast coast of the U.S. was finally focused when the Coast Guard found debris from the plane. Lt. GARY JONES, U.S. Coast Guard : We have confirmed that that luggage was from this flight. PETER JENNINGS :( voice-over) For the next two hours, the latest developments in this tragedy. We are joined by Charles Gibson in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Barbara Walters and Ted Koppel. Tonight, the country waits for word @!ANNOUNCER This is an ABC News Special. " John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s Plane Is Missing : The Nation Waits. " Now reporting from ABC News world headquarters, Peter Jennings. PETER JENNINGS : Good evening, everybody. Once again today, the Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There has been so much tragedy for the Kennedys. Tonight, we 're involved in a mystery. John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette, seen there on the right -- though it 's an old picture of her, the only one we have -- they 've not been found, though bits of their airplane have been. So we 're also here, to some extent, to examine a life that most of us assume has been lost. John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s life has only been several chapters long. I 'm also joined tonight, besides Barbara Walters and Ted Koppel and Charlie Gibson, the whole family of ABC News correspondents and analysts as we spend the next couple of hours trying to understand what has happened and trying to understand what it means, that what has happened, or which has happened. I want to go first to Martha 's Vineyard, where the search is now focused, to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who flew there earlier today. Bill, what 's happening tonight? BILL BLAKEMORE, ABC News : Officials have just told us, Peter, that they are still double-checking their facts. They say that in about an hour, at 9:00 Eastern Time, the state police, district attorneys and others will be here to give us some sort of a news conference. They will not confirm what they found. Of course, we have these other reports that a number of items have washed up on the beach. But so far, aside from the fact that they have blocked off a number of the roads at the southwest corner of this island and are searching the beach, we 're still waiting. PETER JENNINGS : Bill, you were around the southwest corner of the island quite a lot today. Did you have any sense of the search? BILL BLAKEMORE : We could hear the helicopters out over the sea. We know that one of the possible impact sites was so far out into the haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And, indeed, we could n't. There was a great deal of haze, as is very common here in the summer, beginning to build up in the afternoon. The interesting point there, I 've talked to a number of pilots, and they all say the haze here in the late afternoon and evenings makes flying in to this island, this airport, very tricky. They think that might have happened last night. PETER JENNINGS : Bill, thanks for now. We 'll come back to you before this broadcast is over. Bill Blakemore. ABC 's John Miller traveled to Martha 's Vineyard by sea. And of course, the search for the debris from the plane, the search for the three passengers has been very extensive around the southwest corner of the island particularly. ABC 's John Miller is on Martha 's Vineyard tonight. John, what can you tell us for a start? JOHN MILLER, ABC News : The search is in very high gear, even though the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes of daylight left here yet. I 've been watching the Coast Guard boats coming in. And I 've been watching the new teams going out for what may be an extended night-time search. We have n't been told that. But if they are leaving with their crews at this hour to start, it 's presumable that they are going to work in the dark. Aside from those boats, we 've been seeing. PETER JENNINGS : One of the things, John - one of the things they did not do was search last night in part because a family acquaintance only got in touch with the Coast Guard at about 2:00 in the morning, so the search did not begin until first light. Do you think they will search through the night tonight? JOHN MILLER : Well, it certainly appears that they have the resources out here, and they 're sending some more resources out now. So it appears they 're going to, if not search through the night, at least search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, three-mile square grids, and assigned them to different 41-foot Coast Guard boats under the command of the Coast Guard cutter Hammerhead. Areas of special interest -- the waters off Gay Head, near the beach where that suitcase washed ashore, which may have had items in it. Another area of special interest -- an Air Force plane observed an oil slick in the water a couple of miles off Martha 's Vineyard. They have dispatched teams there to drop sonar from the boat to scan the bottom to see if they can come up with any evidence that way. Again, the Massachusetts state police dive team boarded a Coast Guard boat when I was at their station and went out with them as the sun was going down. So it looks like they 're going to be out there for some time tonight, if not all night. PETER JENNINGS : John, it looks like that it will be scaled back to some extent overnight and that the helicopters will be brought in and start full bore again tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the evidence that has been found. Debris has been found, including a piece of baggage, including a wheel, a head rest? JOHN MILLER : And a glove. This is a tricky business, though. They 're sorting through this stuff. A lot of this stuff are things that could have blown off a boat. But they 're working very carefully with that to see how much of it they can actually tie to the aircraft, how much they can tie to the individuals who were on it. PETER JENNINGS : OK, John Miller and Bill Blakemore, who are on Martha 's Vineyard tonight, where the search has been centered. Martha 's Vineyard is where John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s mother had a house, and when she died, she left the house to John and his sister, Caroline. Caroline, by the way, has been in the western United States in Colorado on a vacation with her family. She is headed back East tonight. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often gather in times of tragedy, at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and ABC 's Charles Gibson is there. Charles? CHARLES GIBSON, ABC News : Peter, just a little story of how things transpired last night, overnight and this morning. John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife, Carolyn, called the house where they were going to be staying here at the compound last night before they took off from New Jersey and said we 'll be in a little bit after 10:00. Would you mind bringing John 's jeep over to the airport? And a family employee took it over there. And it was that employee who first began to sense that things had gone awry when they had n't come in by 11:00. But the family said, no, leave the jeep at the airport, John will pick it up and drive it in when he arrives. And so, the family employee took a cab back here, left the jeep there. Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep and bring it back, and that was the surest sign of all, obviously, that the family knew John F. Kennedy, Jr. was n't coming in. PETER JENNINGS : Charlie, this was going to be such a happy day there. They 'd all gathered for a wedding. CHARLES GIBSON : Yes, it was supposed to be a happy day. And the signs of that are right down the beach, as you 'll see in these pictures.( voice-over) The tents along the Hyannis Port beach was in place today for the 275 guests here to celebrate the wedding of Bobby and Ethel Kennedy 's young 's child, Rory. But instead of the evening wedding and reception, the tent has been used for services of prayer -- one this morning, one this evening. Early in the day, we could see young wedding guests walking the beach here, hand in hand. No one could really imagine a scenario where John, Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they roamed the beach. A family spokesman said the presence of so many young Kennedy grandchildren, Rory 's nieces and nephews, kept the mood light and hopeful, particularly at the morning prayer service. BRIAN O'CONNOR, Kennedy Family Spokesman : The prayers were about hope. Hope for the people who were not present. And expression of best wishes for Rory and Mark. And prayers for the family. CHARLES GIBSON :( voice-over) But that was early in the day. And that family spokesman has had no gauge of the family mood for the past seven hours. And the surest sign, really, of what family members expected came when the wedding was canceled this morning. Ethel Kennedy, the bride 's mother, who we saw only briefly through a long lens, knew that there would be no celebration today. We took particular note of the flagpoles in the compound. The flags stayed high. No one would lower them to half- staff until they knew for sure. The faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day dragged on. Here, former congressman Joe Kennedy. And the eeriest was seeing the trappings and preparations of a normal wedding going on even after the ceremony had been canceled -- catering trucks, flowers, the band equipment, sound and lights. And perhaps most poignant, the tuxedos that were to be worn by groomsmen in the wedding.( on camera) Peter, this is a very difficult place to be, because essentially what we 're all doing here -- and there are an enormous number of reporters and local residents of the Hyannis and Hyannis Port area -- what we 're all essentially doing is waiting for word that the family has gotten the word of what we all fear and now expect. And given the distinct possibility that the three bodies are encased in the fuselage in that plane and that the plane is under water, as you were talking about with John Miller, this is a very small plane to find under a very large ocean. PETER JENNINGS : Thanks, Charlie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over. I think we 're all struck by the words of Admiral Richard Larrabee, who 's the Coast Guard commander in the area, earlier today when he pointed out they found debris on the sea and this had helped them to pinpoint the search. It was clearly a bad sign in terms of what had actually happened to the craft. And then he said, " I can tell you so many miraculous stories of people surviving, " which lends so much credence to the notion that at the compound at Hyannis Port and all across the country, people are still waiting for some kind of definitive word. In a moment, how did this aircraft get into trouble? Where did it get into trouble? Please stay with us. We 'll be back in just a moment @!ANNOUNCER " John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s Plane Is Missing : The Nation Waits " - this ABC News Special will continue in a moment.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : An ABC News Special -- " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Nation Waits " continues. PETER JENNINGS : It is also almost exactly 24 hours since JFK, Jr. and his wife and her sister went to New Jersey to get into a plane, which he had bought not long ago, to make a flight to Martha 's Vineyard and then on to Hyannis. It was an intended stop, as we know. Somebody, presumably Lauren, but not necessarily, was going to be dropped off on Martha 's Vineyard. And as Charlie Gibson told us, JFK, Jr. was going to arrive in Hyannis last night. And then the accident. ABC 's Lisa Stark in Washington has been following this from the moment we first heard about it. And she helps us now put together the entire scenario of the day. Lisa? LISA STARK, ABC News : Well, Peter, clearly it appears as though a plane has been lost. It appears as though there has been a crash. But the National Transportation Safety Board has still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators in place. But I guess, like many people, they 're hoping against hope, they 're just waiting for a little more evidence. We would expect, though, that they will officially launch that investigation as early as tomorrow. Now, this all began as a routine flight last night.( voice-over) Kennedy 's plane, a single-engine Piper Saratoga, took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, New Jersey, around 8:30 last night, bound for Martha 's Vineyard, an hour and 15 minute flight. Visibility was three to five miles. It was hazy. Pilot Kyle Bailey saw the trio board the airplane. KYLE BAILEY, Pilot : I just thought the visibility was so poor, you know, I just thought to myself, " Well, I ca n't believe he 's doing the trip tonight. " LISA STARK :( voice-over) The flight was operating under visual flight rules, meaning visibility was good enough that flying by instruments alone was not necessary. No flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News has learned the plane was cruising at an altitude of 5,500 feet, made a turn to the south toward the island, descended to 2,500 feet, then 2, 200 feet. The next indication on radar, an altitude of 1,300 feet. Meaning the plane would have traveled 900 feet down in just 12 seconds. Aviation experts call that a precipitous dive. Radar contact was lost at 1,300 feet, an altitude far too low for an approach to the airport some 20 miles away. The Piper plane like this one was equipped with an emergency locator beacon. But the Coast Guard says they never received a signal from the aircraft. JFK, Jr. should have arrived on the Vineyard around 10:00 p.m. He was to have dropped off his sister-in-law, then continued on to Hyannis Port with his wife. Just after 2:00 a.m., a family friend notified the Coast Guard that the plane was missing. It was n't until after 7:30 in the morning that a search was launched. Authorities first tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen agencies began an extensive search from Long Island to Martha 's Vineyard. The Air Force, Air National Guard, the Civil Air Patrol, the Coast Guard, launching all available boats and planes. Private boats in the area also helped in the search. By 3:00 p.m., there was grim news. Lt. GARY JONES, U.S. Coast Guard : We have a confirmed report that there was a piece of baggage that belonged to one of the persons who were described to have been on that flight. Family notifications are being made at this time, so I am not at liberty to give you that name. LISA STARK :( voice-over) Other debris turned up, possibly from the plane -- a head rest, carpet, a wheel, a sneaker. Using debris and radar data, the search area narrowed to the waters west of Martha 's Vineyard. Officials said there is always hope. Rear Adm. RICHARD LARRABEE, U.S. Coast Guard : Each one of these cases is different. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I can tell you that in previous cases like this, we 've searched as many as three or four days. We 're not ready to give up on this yet. And we 're going to continue to focus on search and rescue. LISA STARK :( voice-over) The Coast Guard is bringing in the Rude., a ship with sophisticated side-scanning sonar. It will search for signs of any debris on the ocean bottom. The Piper Saratoga owned by JFK, Jr., a plane like this one, was manufactured in 1995. PIPER COMPANY SPOKESMAN : This is a very safe airplane. It 's equipped very well. LISA STARK :( voice-over) JFK, Jr. just purchased this single-engine, high-performance plane, two and a half months ago. So he presumably had little experience in this kind of cockpit. And he got his pilot 's license just over a year ago, training at Flight Safety International at Vero Beach airport in Florida. The restaurant there boasts his autograph.( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Martha 's Vineyard who had flown with JFK, Jr., had instructed him at times, in fact. He called him a diligent - excuse me - pilot who loved to fly. A few weeks after he got his pilot 's license, JFK, Jr. talked with USA Today, and he joked at that time that the only person who would fly with him was his wife. And he also told the newspaper, " Now, whenever we want to get away, we can just go in the plane and fly off. " Peter? PETER JENNINGS : Thanks very much, Lisa, for that and for all day. The instructor that Lisa 's referring to up on Martha 's Vineyard, Arthur Marks( ph), said he may not have been the best pilot in the world, but he was a good pilot. And he was familiar with the area. And he did know this island. He was as familiar, he said, with this airport as someone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to talk to our aviation specialist, John Nance, about this plane and about this. But before we do that, I want to go back to Lieutenant Gary Jones, the Coast Guard, who you saw just a moment ago to see if there 's any later news, Gary, than we heard in your earlier briefing. Voice of GARY JONES : Well, Mr. Jennings, currently, as was stated, the NOAA research vessel Rude is on scene executing its side-scanning sonar, which is mapping out the area, trying to look for any sign of debris or large-scale object under the water. As well as the Coast Guard has two H-60 helicopters and four boats that are still scouring the area. Number one, looking for any signs of survivors, and we 're still pushing through on the search. PETER JENNINGS : Of the debris that you 've actually got your hands on, how much of it showed up out at sea and how much of it washed up on shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found this afternoon, what I can confirm was a piece of personal luggage that was about 1,000 - I 'm sorry -- about 100 yards off of the beach, off of Gay Head beach. PETER JENNINGS : In Martha 's Vineyard. Voice of GARY JONES :. in Martha 's Vineyard, as well as a piece of aircraft, head rest from the seat and some luggage from the inside of the aircraft. PETER JENNINGS : Admiral Larrabee said in his briefing earlier that because you had found debris out at sea, it sounded like almost you 'd found a field of debris, it was going to make the searching out there a good deal easier now. Has that been the case? Voice of GARY JONES : Well, the crews are looking. But things such as the current and, you know, the tides make it a little tricky to try and pinpoint a specific impact location. As I said, you know, our crews do this, and a large number of the crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the unfortunate TWA 800 incident. So with respect to that, you know, our people are very, very well-trained, and they 're good at what they do. So we 're going to press on. PETER JENNINGS : Well, thanks very much, indeed, Lieutenant Gary Jones from the Coast Guard in Boston. They had a very busy day up there. Does n't sound like they 've made an awful lot of progress since we talked to them several hours ago. The USS Rude, by the way, to which he refers, which did appear -- this is the third anniversary of the crash of TWA 800 -- and so there is a graphic representation of what it does. It draws something which is colloquially known as a fish along close to the surface of the ocean. It can look out a couple hundred meters on either side. But the bottom of the ocean is, as anybody who dives knows, a rather complicated place. Now, I want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a pilot, with John Nance, our aviation specialist, who is himself also a commercial pilot. John? JOHN NANCE, ABC News Aviation Editor : Yes. PETER JENNINGS : Someone from the Boston Globe writes this today. " Visibility was n't optimal. He was n't licensed to fly using instruments only. And some fellow pilots suggest he should have brought a flight instructor. And he had just upgraded to a more powerful and complicated plane. " What do you think? JOHN NANCE : Well, those are all possibly valid points, Peter. The problem is when you look back in hindsight, especially at an early point like this, it 's easy to see how somebody stacked the deck against themselves, and that apparently is what we have here. But that does not necessarily mean it was unsafe or it was lousy judgment. Those things, I think, are going to have to be a downline analysis. What we basically have here is a visibility problem, and a pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility got dicey. And when you put yourself in that position -- single engine, at night, over water, no instrument training -- you have stacked the deck to make it a more difficult situation if anything goes wrong, such as the weather changing precipitously, which it does in this region. PETER JENNINGS : So the rest of us are going to close our eyes for a second, John, and ask you to get in the cockpit seat, look out the window, see the haze, see the island, I assume, somewhere in the distance, and tell us you what happens when you become disoriented. You 've been talking about this all day. JOHN NANCE : When you become disoriented, it can take only just a few seconds of looking down to change a radio or putting your concentration someplace else. You start banking off in one direction or another. You look up. Nothing is making sense outside. And you put the wrong control inputs in. You either pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spin, get it into a spiral. Now you 're totally confused, and before you can figure out what 's happened, you 're in the water. That is a likely, although not necessarily a certain, scenario. PETER JENNINGS : So you 're saying that if you look away -- he 's flying on what 's called VFR, visual flight rules. He 's flying on the basis of what he sees in front of him. If he looks away only for a second to do something, the plane may go totally different - may go upside down, he may not realize it? JOHN NANCE : Well, not completely upside down. But if you 're into a bank, Peter, and your reference point is outside and you ca n't see those reference points anymore because of this haze, you look up, something does n't feel quite right. Your vestibular senses - senses of where you 're sitting in your seat basically and your body are going to tell you everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very easy, if you do n't go to those instruments, if you 're not trained, to make the wrong decision. Maybe he pulled too hard. PETER JENNINGS : John - I 'm not a pilot, John, but even I know -- I think most people know sitting in front of an instrument panel in any airplane, you 've got that gyroscope there that tells you what the relationship is between your plane and the horizon. JOHN NANCE : Right. Right. Artificial horizon is what it used to be called. PETER JENNINGS : Right. JOHN NANCE : And he should go to that first. But a lot of visual trained pilots who have not been trained with instruments are going to be frantically looking outside. And that 's where you can get in trouble. It is n't necessarily - it does n't have to be that way, Peter. But it could explain this. PETER JENNINGS : OK, John. Thank you very much for the moment. John has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to speculate or become engrossed with a single point, and then it could be any number of other things. Let 's go back to Martha 's Vineyard because Bill Blakemore has some late notes. Bill? BILL BLAKEMORE : Hello, Peter, can you hear me? PETER JENNINGS : I can, indeed. BILL BLAKEMORE : Peter, I 've just spoken with a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force Auxiliary Air Patrol in uniform. He told me that he had spent eight hours searching today and then went to the beach where he has just been. He said that he watched them bringing in parts of a plane. He described a wheel that had floated to the surface, a strut along with it. He described parts of a seat, parts of other seats of the plane. And also said that they saw a slick out on the oil -- out on the waters. He said it was not an oil slick apparently. It looked to him like a gasoline slick. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted it and laid down some green dye markers, he said, so the searchers could come in and look at it. So this does not appear to be good news. This is not official either. He did not say that it was the plane. But certainly in the area they expected to find parts of the plane if there was, indeed, a crash. PETER JENNINGS : Bill Blakemore on Martha 's Vineyard, thanks very much. Again, we 're not altogether sure that the debris that is coming ashore at the moment is not the debris that was identified earlier. But as the Coast Guard commander said earlier, once they got fixed on the debris and fixed on where it was, there was no question in their minds that they were looking at a catastrophe, though they were, as he said, still searching, mindful of their responsibility. When we come back, Barbara Walters talks about a young man who has had to shoulder an awful lot of responsibility.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits, " will continue after this from our ABC stations.( Station Break) ANNOUNCER : An ABC News Special -- " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " - continues. PETER JENNINGS : Good evening again. I 'm Peter Jennings. Some wise person remarked not too long ago that in this age of celebrity, we all become members of the international family. It does n't really matter always whom tragedy strikes. In the case of the Kennedys, of course, they 've been with the country for so very long. For so very, very long. Not many people knew John F. Kennedy well, I suspect, but one of the people in our field who knew him well, as well as I think journalists do -- Barbara Walters. BARBARA WALTERS, ABC News : Well, I do n't want to say that I knew him well. I did not know him well. But I had spent some time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had so much responsibility in his life, Peter, and, indeed, he had. So that to a lot of us, it 's surprising to learn that he might have been a risk taker. You know, flying without a co-pilot in a single- engine plane. So much had happened to him just in the last few years. His mother 's death in May of 1994. In 1995, he opens -- starts to publish this magazine, George. A lot of people said it was not going to make it. In 1996, he marries Carolyn Bessette, who had not been in the spotlight. By the way, his mother had never met. And this seemed to be now a very good time in his life. The magazine seems to have made it. He had become a reporter himself, doing some very good journalistic pieces. Some very good interviews. Marriage three years old, seemed to be strong. The paparazzi were no longer on his back all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, indeed, was n't he, from the moment he was born.( voice-over) If we ever had a selective national photo album, the pictures of John F. Kennedy, Jr. would at once be instantly familiar to millions of us and, of course, bring back a flood of memories. And no wonder. Pres. JOHN F. KENNEDY : I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) He was born within weeks of his father 's election. The only child ever born to a president-elect. A living reminder that the nation had elected a young 42-year-old as its leader. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : You have to remember that both my sister and I, particularly myself, view my father 's administration through the color of others and the perceptions of others and through photographs and through what we 've read. And so, it 's difficult for us to discern much about him independently of what other people 's impressions are. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John, seldom talked with reporters about himself or his memories. But seven years ago, he and his sister, Caroline, did tell our Jay Schadler about some special times so long ago. JAY SCHADLER, ABC News : Do you have any memories of your dad at all? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : I have a few. He had this desk in the Oval Office, which was made -- which belonged to a sea captain. And it was made from American frigate. And I just remember the inside, you could climb around in. And there were cavernous spaces in it. JAY SCHADLER : You remember crawling inside? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Yeah, and just hanging out there. And he used to give us chewing gum, because my mother did n't like us to chew gum. So we 'd used to go over to the Oval Office at night, and he 'd feed us gum under the desk. JAY SCHADLER : There 's a shot that I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the helicopter. Do you remember the White House helicopter coming down? CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG : Oh, sure. That was big excitement. JAY SCHADLER : Big event. CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG : Right. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) And who could ever forget that searing image now ingrained in all our memories. Within a few days shy of his third birthday -- as a toddler, he saluted his slain father 's coffin as it passed him by. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : It 's not something, frankly, I mean, I know this is hard to believe, but it 's not a subject which I spent a great deal of time analyzing. I understand that that was, obviously, a very historically significant event. He was a president. And there are people who -- historians, filmmakers, etc. -- who are going to make money and time studying that. Whatever they decide or whatever they find, it 's not going to change the one fundamental fact in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) Shortly after the assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy moved her family here to an apartment in New York City. There were semblances of a normal life. But five years later, Bobby Kennedy, who had become a surrogate father to John and his sister, was assassinated, too. And within four months, Jacqueline Kennedy married Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Pierre Salinger remembers it well. PIERRE SALINGER, Former Kennedy Press Secretary : Jackie came into my office, and she told me something which I 've never forgotten. She said, " You know, I only have one thing to do in life now. I have to take care of these kids. I have to bring them up. I have to get them intelligent. I have to get them in good shape so that they can go into a real career in the future. Because if I do n't do that, they 'll be totally linked to their father 's death. " BARBARA WALTERS :( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John, Jr. was largely out of public sight. Photographers occasionally managed to get a glimpse of him, almost always with his mother close by. And as a foreshadowing of things to come, whenever he did appear in public, it was a guarantee of a media mob. John and his sister, Caroline, returned to New York City after Aristotle Onassis 's death, and John began to emerge in controlled situations. The dedication of the JFK library in Boston was a prime example in October of 1979. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : I think continually of those who, from the womb, remembered the soul 's history through corridors of light. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) John, Jr. seemed to have trouble finding himself as a young man. He attended the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy in Massachusetts, and Brown University, where he thought he wanted to be an actor. Biographer Wendy Lee( ph). WENDY LEE, Biographer : John was very able to throw himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in a strange way, that was his escape, his only escape from the role of being John F. Kennedy, Jr. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) He was graduated from Brown University in 1983, to the cheers of an adoring family. After Brown University, expectations for the son of America 's most famous dynasty were huge. His path was uncertain, and the public scrutiny was unrelenting. He never did become an actor. But instead, JFK, Jr. attended law school in New York City. Speculation was that it was Jackie who wanted it that way. JOHN DAVIS, Cousin : Jackie put her foot down and said, " You will not be an actor. You will be in a profession. " And made him go to NYU Law School. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) Politics may not have been his chosen career path, but he had all the right stuff. In 1988, 27-year-old John Kennedy, Jr. electrified the Democratic National Convention when he delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unwavering commitment to the poor, to the elderly, to those without hope, regardless of fashion or convention is the greatest reward of public service. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) His speech earned him a two- minute standing ovation. But his law career got Bronx cheers. The tabloids had a field day with his failure to pass the bar exam twice. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : When I failed the bar exam, it was, you know, the New York Post had the " Hunk Flunks. " Some of that I could actually do without. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) The third try was a charm @!REPORTER How you do feel about that? Is it true that you passed the bar? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Apparently it 's true. I got the official word not long ago. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) And he eventually took a job at the Manhattan district attorney 's office. But it was not John Kennedy 's public life that became the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paparazzi followed him everywhere. If JFK, Jr. was in the park, it made the news. The man whom People magazine chose as " the sexiest man alive " became Manhattan 's most eligible bachelor. He was as handsome as any movie star and was himself attracted to Hollywood beauties. There were rumors of a relationship with Madonna.( on camera) Do you mind all the stuff about you? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : What stuff? BARBARA WALTERS : The stuff about being sexy and attractive, and every time you see another woman, there 's all of this, is she the one? Is this the one? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Listen, people can say a lot worse things about you, right, than you were attractive and you look good in a bathing suit. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) For five years, actress Daryl Hannah was " the one. " And the couple was seen everywhere. But the romance fizzled. Although JFK, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to steer clear of the scandals that plagued so many of the rest of the Kennedy clan. When cousin William Kennedy Smith went on trial, accused of rape, JFK, Jr. was there to support him. He also campaigned publicly when his other family members ran for office. All during his time, JFK, Jr. enjoyed a special closeness with his mother. She was his friend, his confidant and the guiding force of his life. But tragedy struck. And Jackie Onassis was diagnosed with cancer. John Kennedy, Jr. was at his mother 's side during her final days. Outside her 5th Avenue apartment, the world 's press waited in anxious vigil. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died in May of 1994. And John Kennedy emerged from the glamorous high rise that he had lived in as a child to announce to the world that his mother had passed away. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Last night, at around 10:15, my mother passed on. She was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and the things that she loved. And she did it in her own way and on her own terms. And we all feel lucky for that. And now, she 's in God 's hands. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) With his mother 's death, John, Jr. seemed suddenly more mature. The little boy America had held so dear was now all grown up.( on camera) Famous children seem to have an extra burden to find themselves, to be themselves. Do you think you have found yourself? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : I think part of what famous children have is that they have an abundance of opportunity. And that life circumstances does n't force them to, you know, choose. And you 've got to choose. I do n't think that I 've seen as many of you in one place since they announced the results of my first bar exam. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) It seemed inevitable that his fate and politics would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John would choose the role of observer rather than participant. In 1995, the son of the 35th president of the United States unveiled his new magazine named for the first. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Ladies and gentlemen, meet George. BARBARA WALTERS :( on camera) You who have avoided the press, have now made yourself, in a sense, one of them. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Sure. Well, you ca n't beat them, join them, right? Here are your messages, Mr. Cohen. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) The irreverent magazine seemed an instant hit, and it gave its famous publisher the chance to shine in a new career as a journalist. Kennedy bylines appeared on sharp-witted interviews with Colin Powell, former Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry and Garth Brooks. JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : How long will it take us? BARBARA WALTERS :( on camera) Did you discuss this magazine with your mother? JOHN F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. KENNEDY, Jr. : Well, I think we showed her a -- I think we showed her a mock cover, and she was a little skeptical. But I think that she had always encouraged both Caroline and I to make our own way to not be -- subordinate our own lives to the expectations of what we should do with our lives. And so, in that respect, I think she got a kick out of it. BARBARA WALTERS :( voice-over) Ultimately, it was a tall, statuesque blonde named Carolyn Bessette, a public relations executive who put an end to Kennedy 's bachelorhood. Reports had surfaced that they were close. There were a few pictures snapped. But the couple 's courtship remained largely private. So private, that the world was stunned in September of 1996 when the wedding was announced after it had already happened. DANA KENNEDY, Entertainment Weekly : The world 's most eligible man is no longer eligible. He 's pretty much our crown prince, and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is married. BARBARA WALTERS : In the last year, the young Kennedys had settled into their lives. The press seemed less a factor. The magazine was doing well. The Martha 's Vineyard home they were heading to last night was their retreat.( on camera) And you know, Peter, as we talk about this and see -- talk about the relationship that JFK, Jr. had with his mother, I think what so many of us must be thinking is, how would she, had she lived, been able to emotionally withstand this? PETER JENNINGS : Well, I must tell you, first of all, that 's a very beautiful piece of work you put together. And I 'm struck by the fact that I recognize virtually everything that 's happened. Which is a reminder, of course, how public the Kennedy relationship has been with us, and the country as a whole. He 's 38. His mother was only 64 when she died, and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassinated. BARBARA WALTERS : One of the people that they just talked to said, " He was our crown prince. " And we think of him, so many people, as the American prince. I mean, it is a cliche to say that he is American royalty, that the family is American royalty. And earlier today, without making too much of a connection, you were saying that in this country, it has some of the feeling of Princess Diana 's death. I mean, he is our royalty. If he has died, he has died too young. He had a life of vulnerability. People could relate to him. He was also as handsome as she was beautiful. I mean, the mythical elements of it is what 's keeping us talking and doing this kind of a program. PETER JENNINGS : Though I deeply suspect that John F. Kennedy 's life will not disappear in the same way, I think, that Princess Diana 's life -- I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him our residential presidential scholar because we feel so proprietary about him on occasions like this. Michael Beschloss, who 's with us in Washington again tonight. Michael, I 'm very struck by what John John, JFK, Jr., was -- never quite sure what to call him because we 've known him for so long, right? When he says to Barbara, " Our mother taught us not to subordinate our lives to the expectations of others. " Enormously difficult for the child -- children of first families. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential Historian : Well, that 's right. And actually, very difficult, very different from his father. Because John Kennedy, after World War II, came back home from his heroism in the Pacific. He was very depressed. He thought he might become a newspaper man or something else. It was only because of the death of his older brother, Joe, Jr. that his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, almost forced Jack to go into politics. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very introverted guy. Interestingly enough, it was more John Kennedy 's mother, Jackie, who really tried to sort of make her own way in the world and not be bound by expectations. One of the things you always hear about her is -- first lady was, her saying that she was n't going to do what all the other first ladies did, she would do it in her own way. PETER JENNINGS : Michael, I 'm struck, too, and have said it before, by how enduring the relationship is with the Kennedys. You were mentioning to me earlier today that in popular polls, even the historians disagree with the notion, John F. Kennedy often comes out as the most popular president. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS : You 've said it. You know, we always think of John Kennedy from 1963 and what we knew at the time as this great man who was suddenly cut down and ended this period of Camelot. But it was during the 1970s that we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underworld that you would imagine would cause Americans at least to think a little bit more skeptically about him and certainly about the entire family. And the amazing thing is that polls in recent years of Americans asking who were the greatest presidents, John Kennedy almost consistently comes out at the top by a pretty wide margin, even over Lincoln and Washington. And I think what this suggests is that people are willing to some extent see what they want to see. All that was very much projected on John Kennedy, Jr. I think they projected all of the good, virtually none of the bad. PETER JENNINGS : I have a question for both of you. First, Barbara. Because I 've been struck today by how much interest there is in the Kennedys across the generations. Why do you think that is? BARBARA WALTERS : They are beautiful people. They were people with a great deal money. They were people with an enormous amount of charm. When John Kennedy gets married, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about. It has all of the trappings that we want to have for people whom we look up to and admire. And at the same time, there is that tragedy, there is what I said before, that vulnerability. There are those aspects, somehow, of wickedness and, again and again, the risk takers. PETER JENNINGS : Just one quick note about John F. Kennedy 's wife. His wife 's sister onboard was, I think, in the banking business. But we do n't know very much about her at all. Lauren Bessette. She was an investment banker. She worked for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York City. BARBARA WALTERS : And had a twin sister. PETER JENNINGS : And had a twin sister, who was in New York today when all this occurred and has now gone to be with her mother in Connecticut. So that question for you, Michael Beschloss. The enduring fascination with the Kennedys, is it just too obvious? MICHAEL BESCHLOSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is dominated by television. We have to sort of find interesting aspects of our public figures that draw us to them. Sure was n't the case in the 19th century. We did n't care much about Benjamin Harrison 's life or private life or life experience. And the other thing, I think you have to say is, to some extent, the ever-presence of death and tragedy in the Kennedy saga. John Kennedy 's life was more interesting -- is more interesting as we read about it today, because you know what happens in the last act. Tragically, I think that 's going to be true of his son. PETER JENNINGS : Michael, you 're a very serious presidential historian. I mean that absolutely -- I mean that very seriously. What do you think about this notion of a curse on the family? Teddy Kennedy once spoke about it in public. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS : He did. And that was only 30 years ago. And we 've seen other evidence of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Peter, other families in American history -- other famous families -- who has had this kind of recurrent, horrible bad luck and tragedy? Even people who are pretty serious presidential historians do begin to think that maybe there is something to this idea of a curse after all. PETER JENNINGS : Thank you very much, Michael. Please do n't go away. Barbara, thank you for that. That was very enlightening. We 're going to continue exploring both this mystery, as we called it at the beginning, what may have occurred in this accident. That is the family compound in Hyannis, to which, as we have said before, the Kennedys retreat in times of tragedy and gather in times of celebration. And they were there today for a wedding of Rory, the youngest child of Senator Robert Kennedy, born after her father was assassinated. So it all, all mixes up. We 'll be back in just a moment.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : This ABC News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters, Peter Jennings. PETER JENNINGS : Just one small piece of news, and it 's not particularly vital, is the National Transport Safety Board in the last few minutes has now formally launched an investigation into this crash. It does n't mean a great deal, except that on this third anniversary of the disaster onboard TWA 800, they are very mindful of the fact that the longer you wait, the longer -- the more time there is to lose an opportunity to understand what 's really happening. It also says that come first light off the coast of Martha 's Vineyard, this investigation will go to full bore again. Though the Pentagon, the Navy, the Coast Guard have all gone out of their way today to say that this is what happens when anybody gets in trouble in any part of the United States. The Coast Guard gets involved in something like this about 50,000 times a year. Barbara Walters mentioned very briefly in her very moving piece about John F. Kennedy, Jr., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn Bessette? Here 's ABC 's Kevin Newman. KEVIN NEWMAN, ABC News :( voice-over) We 've come to know vigils can exist anywhere -- at fences, in school yards and, tonight, at the nondescript front step of the home John and Carolyn shared in lower Manhattan. 1st WOMAN IN NEW YORK : Unfortunately, I 'll probably be telling my own children about this some day. And that 's just really sad. KEVIN NEWMAN :( voice-over) Their apartment was one of the few private places in a very public romance. 2nd WOMAN IN NEW YORK : But it was like having a beautiful flower in your presence when he or Carolyn would be around. It was just nice. KEVIN NEWMAN :( voice-over) As soon as they knew about her, the tabloids crowned Carolyn Bessette " Camelot 's new queen. " It was not a title or a role she relished. It meant that an argument between lovers in Central Park was shared with the country. She gave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the end. What she wore established style, much as it had for the mother-in-law she never met. But at times, the strain showed. In 1996, John, Jr. pleaded with the paparazzi to back off to relieve the pressure. It took the tragic death of Diana, whom Carolyn had sometimes been compared to, to convince the photographers to give the couple some space.( on camera) Carolyn grew up with identical twin sisters who are about 18 months older. When she was quite young, her parents divorced, so she was raised by her mother and her stepfather, a doctor in Greenwich, Connecticut. The sister who was with her in the airplane, Lauren, is described by a friend as social and brilliant, a Rhodes scholar who was working overseas in investment banking. Carolyn and her sister shared a love of gourmet food.( voice-over) For all the press pursuits, the couple managed to elude the media to exchange vows, escaping to a secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after it happened. At their wedding, they danced the first dance to Prince 's " Forever In My Life. " Carolyn and John were last seen with the Kennedys at the funeral of cousin Michael Kennedy, who was killed in a skiing accident. By then, the sorrow of so many events in this family was part of Carolyn, too. Kevin Newman, ABC News. PETER JENNINGS : A friend was telling me today, who had been at that wedding what a delightful time the Kennedys fooling us all again. But again, I 'm struck watching Kevin Newman 's piece, as well as watching you, just how much the media was in their face all the time. BARBARA WALTERS : And this was a girl who was very spontaneous and had to really rein herself in and never answered the press. Never said, you know, no matter what was written, never answered them back. I sat to her one night, and she talked about this, because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely open. And she said, " I have learned, I never say anything. " And she said, " I also will never campaign to my husband. He 's had so much to contend with. He does n't need to have me complain as well. " PETER JENNINGS : Barbara, thank you very much for being here. We 're going to be away for a second. Then we 're going to come back and see how the country has, indeed, been reacting to this all across the country.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " will continue after this from our ABC stations.( Station Break) ANNOUNCER : An ABC News Special -- " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " - continues. Once again, from ABC News world headquarters, Peter Jennings. PETER JENNINGS : Good evening, everybody. It 's a little after 9:00 in the East, a little after 6:00 in the far West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are spending these couple of hours trying to understand as much as we can about the mystery of the crash, which appears -- appears almost overwhelmingly now to have cost the lives of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife and his wife 's sister on their way from New Jersey to Martha 's Vineyard about 24 hours ago now exactly. The Coast Guard and the Navy continue to search in the waters off Martha 's Vineyard this evening. But the search has slowed down just a little bit because of darkness and will be picked up again at first light. But no matter where you were in the country today, and it was a very nice day in most parts of the country -- an awful lot of people on the road going to the beach and doing things outside -- wherever you were when the news began to emerge, people began to feel, have this horrible feeling, I think, of whether or not another Kennedy tragedy was in the making. As some young boy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lost another Kennedy? It appears at this moment, as if that is the case, though nobody wants to say so outright. And none of the searchers will say so officially. But Elizabeth Vargas, who has spent part of the day working on this broadcast, has now been out looking at the rest of the country to see precisely how people are reacting. ELIZABETH VARGAS, ABC News :( voice-over) Public reaction to the disappearance of John Kennedy, Jr. ' s airplane came quickly. Early this morning, the Kennedy family spokesman outside the compound in Hyannis Port was cautiously optimistic. BRIAN O'CONNOR : They 're in constant contact with the military and civil aviation authorities. But there 's no further word at this time. ELIZABETH VARGAS :( voice-over) In Germany, Russia and Great Britain, evening newscasts led with word that yet another tragedy may have struck what has been called America 's royal family. BBC ANCHORWOMAN : John F. Kennedy, Jr., President Kennedy 's son, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young, vibrant, and handsome, John F. Kennedy, Jr. seems in many ways to be the living embodiment of the best of the Kennedy legacy. Massachusetts congressman Ed Markey says John, Jr. is the Kennedy family 's shining light. Rep. ED MARKEY,( D) Massachusetts : His brothers, Ted and Bob, originally picked up the fallen torch. And the expectation was, and it has come to pass, that the next generation of Kennedys would do so as well -- with John F. Kennedy being, without question, the unfulfilled destiny of his father, whose life was cut short. ELIZABETH VARGAS :( voice-over) Close friends and family of John and Carolyn Kennedy, including Carolyn 's older sister whose twin was onboard that plane, gathered today at their New York apartment. The mood inside was somber. One friend called it surreal, saying no one could truly believe this was happening. John, Jr. and Carolyn were a familiar presence in this neighborhood, known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, eating at the corner diner and rollerblading through the streets. Many residents say despite being known as America 's royalty, they were down-to- earth. MAN IN NEW YORK : They actually seemed very low profile, you know? Never really -- I do n't think he had a big presence, actually. You know, you 'd see him. And you 'd go on. He 's just like someone in the neighborhood. 1st WOMAN IN NEW YORK : I was just telling him about seeing him on that doorstep about a year and a half ago, begging the press, please, give us some space. ELIZABETH VARGAS :( voice-over) But John Kennedy, Jr. could never escape the Kennedy legacy. Throughout the day, reaction to his disappearance was always filtered through the seemingly limitless tragedy that has befallen members of the Kennedy family. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : That family 's got to be cursed. UNIDENTIFIED MAN : I do n't know how many other horrible tragedies can befall one family. ELIZABETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time out from remembering the Apollo 11 mission President Kennedy inspired to speak to the pain caused by the possible death of JFK 's only son. BUZZ ALDRIN, Apollo 11 Astronaut : Our hearts go out to that family that has started so much, achieved so much, suffered and sacrificed so much. And now has even further uncertainty. ELIZABETH VARGAS :( voice-over) This afternoon in Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore spoke to the increasingly desperate hope of all those following the rescue operation. Vice Pres. AL GORE : So I want to begin with a moment of prayer for John Kennedy, Jr., for his wife, Carolyn, and for her sister Lauren, that they may be returned to us safely and soon. ELIZABETH VARGAS :( voice-over) But even as the search for survivors continues, reaction to the crash suggests that people find something sadly familiar and inevitable about the Kennedys ' fate. From Los Angeles to Chicago to Atlanta, people spoke about John Kennedy, Jr. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the Kennedy family, the best and the brightest never seem to get out alive. PETER JENNINGS : This is a weekend of anniversaries. Buzz Aldrin, the Apollo astronaut, was speaking there at celebrations to mark the 30th anniversary of the beginning of man 's journey, which finally did lead Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong down to the Moon. This is the third anniversary of the disaster onboard TWA 800 off the coast of Long Island, in which so many people lost their lives. And it is also the anniversary of the Chappaquiddick crisis for Senator Kennedy, when a young woman with whom he was traveling late at night, driving across a bridge in Martha 's Vineyard area, was drowned. So this is a weekend people are not going to forget in a hurry. Here in New York, at Lincoln Square, at Lincoln Center, a place where people from all over the world can be found on a summer Saturday night, ABC 's JuJu Chang. JUJU CHANG, ABC News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been talking to this evening are echoing what you were saying earlier about, " Oh, no, not again. Not another tragedy for this family. " Many of the people we talked to said they could not stop watching coverage of today 's events. Many of the people we talked to said that, in fact, this was a mysterious event unfolding. It was a reminder of the fleeting quality of life. That no matter how wealthy you are, no matter how rich and famous you are, that tragedy is tragedy and that we are all at risk. We 're being joined by now by David Klonsky, who worked for the JFK campaign during college. David, why do you think there 's this enduring fascination with the family? DAVID KLONSKY : I think John Kennedy, in particular, represented, in the 1960s, change. He was dynamic. He was personable. He was charming. He was particularly good looking. He was young. And I was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified with him. I identified with his values and some of the things he had to say. And I got a chance to hear him, you know, speak at the university that I was attending at the time in the 1960s. JUJU CHANG : And that charisma remains. Irene, your wife, was saying that losing a former first family member was like almost losing a family member yourself. Why is that? IRENE KLONSKY : Well, being part of that whole generation, watching him get elected. Being part of the inauguration. Remembering the snowy, cold day. He was the first president that I could recall that did n't wear a top hat. Sharing in their, you know, birth of John Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy. And being part of John Kennedy being assassinated. It was just so painful. And then, the Robert Kennedy assassination. And then -- it just was having them part of my family. JUJU CHANG : Thank you, Peter. Peter, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger generation, many of the young folks said they did n't remember Kennedy administration events at all, that they were n't alive. That JFK, Jr. ' s life was more of a celebrity and that this was a sad note. But clearly, among the older generation, there is a slightly different sentiment. Peter? PETER JENNINGS : Thanks very much, JuJu Chang. It is clearly a generational thing. In 1963, ask anybody where you were when John F. Kennedy was killed, and we all have an answer to precisely where we were at that given moment. But there has been today, listening to members of subsequent generations, a very, very interesting take on the Kennedys as an enduring factor in American life and in American politics as well. We 'll return to that subject and others when we come back.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " - continues. PETER JENNINGS : John F. Kennedy, Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his magazine George was more often than not inclined to tweak the nose of the stuffier people in the Washington establishment. But when anything happens to a Kennedy, that is news in the establishment. And here 's ABC 's John Martin. JOHN MARTIN, ABC News :( voice-over) Ever since he was a little boy, young John Kennedy has had a special place in Washington. Not only as the son of a president and heir to a political dynasty, but as publisher of a magazine about the world of politics. The President, who flew to Camp David last night, was awakened early this morning and told that Kennedy 's plane had disappeared. Mr. Clinton has said he idolized Kennedy 's father when he was a boy, displaying a picture of the two of them. One of Clinton 's cabinet members, Andrew Cuomo, is married to Kerry Kennedy, a cousin of John, Jr. The White House issued a statement. " All prayers and thoughts are with the families of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican conference. In the heat today, tourists moved slowly at Arlington National Cemetery, where his father is buried. JULIAN ROSALES, Chicago : They 've always seemed to have done good things for other people. It just seems like misfortune happens to them all the time. ANN HANSEN, Blair, Nebraska : I ca n't imagine that so many tragedies would happen in a single family in such a short span of time. JOHN MARTIN :( voice-over) Congress, where his father served, was on weekend recess. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt recalled a recent visit to George, Kennedy 's magazine. Rep. RICHARD GEPHARDT,( D) Missouri : Just to look around that room and see so many young people who were there because of their interests in politics, and they had been brought to that task by John Kennedy, Jr. JOHN MARTIN :( voice-over) The magazine covers politics with an eye as much on the glamour of Hollywood as the nuts and bolts of government. It is widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts : Once a month, George magazine comes in to every single congressional office in Washington. And once a month, I can promise you, just about every young person in every congressional office goes through George magazine. JOHN MARTIN :( voice-over) Eleven years ago, that one prolonged glimpse of Kennedy at the podium sent the Democratic National Convention in roars of applause. The possibility of the son following his father 's footsteps partly explains his attraction, says Congressman Markey. ED MARKEY : That John F. Kennedy, Jr. represents the unfulfilled potential of his father, but also the hope for the next generation of politics in the United States. JOHN MARTIN :( on camera) Kennedy left this city after his father 's assassination 36 years ago, but he is still a presence here. And his disappearance has left the capital in a state of shock and prayer. John Martin, ABC News, Washington. PETER JENNINGS : Congressman Markey, of course, is a Democrat from Massachusetts, long-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for younger people to remember that the Kennedys were not always so popular. Not by any means revered by anyone. That story from Ted Koppel, when we come back.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " will continue after this from our ABC stations.( Station Break) ANNOUNCER : " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " continues. Once again, Peter Jennings. PETER JENNINGS : This search for JFK, Jr. and his wife and his wife 's sister Lauren will continue through the night. The Air Force is now bringing in a couple of helicopters or at least one helicopter, which has an infrared device which will enable them to continue to search throughout the evening. The Massachusetts police are sending divers to the area. One of the ships belonging to the National Oceanic Association is coming up from Montauk to put a fish or electronic scanning device into the bottom of the ocean. They continue to find personal items from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by members of the public. Public reminded that if you keep a piece of debris from anything like this, it 's an arrestable offense. But in fact, that suitcase did - it 's now been confirmed by the Boston police -- belonged to Lauren Bessette, the sister. And they also found a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Kennedy. So the evidence of tragedy continues to mount. And as we 've said, in the course of this two hours, what we wanted to do was to try to focus on the mystery, which is becoming less of a mystery all the time, except perhaps what happened to the aircraft. And the general history of America 's connection with this family, which has been experience of both triumph and tragedy. Here 's ABC 's Ted Koppel. TED KOPPEL, ABC News :( voice-over) There has probably never been a family in American public life more envied and more pitied than the Kennedys. Rich, famous, handsome, powerful -- and yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any single family, however large, could bear. Several of the tragedies that afflicted this family struck before the Kennedys were quite as prominent on the American landscape as they would eventually become. Joseph Kennedy, the acknowledged patriarch of the clan, himself the product of a privileged background -- Boston Latin School, Harvard University -- was a brutally tough businessman who made his fortune in the Roaring ' 20s -- banking, movies, bootlegging. RONALD KESSLER, Author : Well, I think, as a boy, he would really almost black mail people. He would pay off people. Really almost anything to get ahead, make money. TED KOPPEL :( on camera) Did he ever cross the line into illegality? I mean, it is often said that he was a bootlegger. RONALD KESSLER : Yes. No. There 's no question that he was a bootlegger. His family was in the liquor business before Prohibition. All of a sudden at the end of Prohibition, he was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his stock before the market crashed in ' 29. And on that fortune, he built a political dynasty. His wife, Rose, whom Americans would see fleetingly over the next 60-some odd years, the constant pillar of faith and strength as the family plunged from triumph to disaster and back again. HAYNES JOHNSON, Author/Journalist : Any one of us who has children, the horror and the nightmare is what happens if one of them dies. I do n't know how you could handle it. How could she have handled it over and over and over again - - in fact, the whole family, but particularly her. And living as long as she did and seeing one after the other after the other go down in the most horrifying of ways. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) Their oldest son, Joe Kennedy, Jr. He was the one supposed to be the first Kennedy in the White House. But in 1944, flying on a secret mission from England to Calais, France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with explosives, was intended to blow up a German bunker. The crew was to parachute to safety. Joseph Kennedy was 29. This was Joe Kennedy 's younger sister, Rosemary. The family had always maintained that she was retarded. When she was 23, doctors recommended a lobotomy. It failed. RONALD KESSLER : Believe it or not, that was a myth that Joe Kennedy created, because it was more -- it was less embarrassing to say that she was retarded than to say the truth, which is that she was mentally ill. She had a form of mental illness essentially something like manic depression. They had some name for it in those days. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) Rosemary has been institutionalized since the operation in 1941. She 's now 80. Then in 1948, still before most Americans had become aware of the Kennedy family and its ambitions, another plane crash and another Kennedy youngster dead -- Kathleen Kennedy. She was 28. In years to come, as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first for Congress and then for the U.S. Senate and ultimately for the presidency itself, these earlier tragedies would become a part of the fabric of the Kennedy story. But most of us only learned about these events later, when the country as a whole began to focus on this young man, attempting to become the first Catholic in the White House. RONALD KESSLER : There certainly was prejudice against Catholics. There was always concern that the Pope would, you know, call the shots. But Joe had the answer. He put Jack into TV acting lessons, which was unheard of in those days. And you could see the result in the Nixon/JFK debate. And Joe also made sure that he paid off the right people. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) By the narrowest of margins, John Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon for the presidency in 1960. Pres. JOHN F. KENNEDY : Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. TED KOPPEL :( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult now to remember how angry people were at the arrogance of this new president appointing his own brother attorney general of the United States. But those were the glory days. In 1962, Ted Kennedy would be elected U.S. senator from Massachusetts. And there they were -- Jack, the president ; Bobby, the attorney general ; Teddy, the senator. And all of them young, with long lives stretching out ahead of them. He and she and the children were picture perfect. Nobody wrote about presidential infidelities or indiscretions in those days. Although, as it later turned out, there would have been plenty to write about. There was a hit musical on Broadway celebrating King Arthur and his knights of the roundtable at a place called Camelot. That 's how Jackie Kennedy wanted these times to be remembered -- as Camelot. In late November of 1963, as part of the run-up to the ' 64 elections, John Kennedy paid a campaign visit to Dallas @!REPORTER Something has happened here. Something is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :( voice-over) And this, for many years to come, would be the image of John Kennedy, Jr., saluting the caisson carrying his father 's coffin, that would be seared into our memories. John John, and standing nearby, his uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, now carrying all the burdens and soon to carry the hopes and ambitions of the Kennedy clan. HAYNES JOHNSON : Clearly, the sense of tragedy, the sense of fatalism, the family curse or the family legacy did transform him. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) Before and during his brother 's administration, Bobby Kennedy had always been known as the tough guy, the hatchet man, the enforcer. After the assassination, he became the protector of the legacy. There had never been much love lost between President Lyndon Johnson and Bobby Kennedy. Kennedy thought that the war in Vietnam was destroying America. More and more, he came to believe that perhaps he should challenge Lyndon Johnson for the presidency in 1968. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the Democratic nomination was effectively his. President Johnson had announced that he would n't run again. ROBERT KENNEDY : My thanks to all of you. And now it 's on to Chicago, and let 's win there. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) It looked as though another Kennedy might be about to win the presidency in his own right @!ANCHORMAN We 've heard an alarming report that Robert Kennedy was shot. UNIDENTIFIED MAN : Oh, my God. Senator Kennedy has been shot. Be very careful. Get the gun! TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) He would linger for another day. When Bobby Kennedy died, he was 42. Everyone now assumed that the mantle would pass to the next brother in line, Senator Ted Kennedy. But only a year after his brother John was shot, Ted Kennedy was aboard a private plane when it crashed. One of the senator 's aides, Edward Moss, was killed. Kennedy 's back was broken. Then five years later, 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18, 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in an incident that was far more damaging to his presidential hopes than anything that had happened before. Driving home after a party on Chappaquiddick Island, Kennedy drove off a bridge and into the water below. He survived, but a young woman with him, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned and was later recovered from the submerged car. In 1980, Senator Kennedy would challenge incumbent Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination. But Chappaquiddick would always stand between Ted Kennedy and the White House. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the story of the Kennedys is that they fluctuate as a family between tragedy and triumph. And just when it looked as though Ted Kennedy had disqualified himself from any chance of political greatness, he began to emerge as one of the most effective senators of our time. ADAM CLYMER, The New York Times : Many people who had gone through the assassinations of two brothers and a plane crash of his own, which happened within four years, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just keeps plugging away. And legislatively, he 's developed probably -- certainly one of the strongest legislative records of anybody who 's ever served in the Senate. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) What is so staggering about the Kennedy saga, though, is the sheer volume of tragedy that the family has endured. In 1973, Ted Kennedy 's son Edward, Jr. had his right leg amputated because of cancer. In 1986, son Patrick, then a teenager, sought treatment for cocaine addiction. Patrick Kennedy is now a congressman from Rhode Island. Among Robert and Ethel Kennedy 's 11 children, these incidents. Son Joseph involved in an automobile accident that left a female passenger paralyzed for life. Young Joe Kennedy also served as a congressman from Massachusetts. Robert, Jr. arrested and charged with heroin possession in 1983. He is now a leading environmental activist. Sons David and Michael are among the many Kennedys who died far too young. TED SCHWARZ, Author : I think the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the greatest tragedy. This was a child who was watching television when his father was assassinated -- this is Bobby 's son -- so he went on heavily into drugs. He was down in Florida, down in Palm Beach. Someone, possibly one of his family members, got him some drugs that were from his grandmother, who was quite ill, and the drugs, which nobody knew, caused you to stop breathing. Really kind of a wasted life. A kid who went on constantly running, and no one was able to reach him. That 's probably the greatest tragedy within that family. TED KOPPEL :( on camera) And then that bizarre skiing accident with Michael. TED SCHWARZ : Yes. And that, to me, is kind of typical of the arrogance you hoped that they would n't have. Here is a kid who was filming - who was using a video camera. He was playing football, all while skiing. The family had been warned not to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was an arrogance. It was n't a case of great athletic prowess. It was a case of just being foolish. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) Among the stories involving young Kennedys, few received more public attention than the 1991 charges against William Kennedy Smith. The nephew of John and Robert and Ted was accused and then later acquitted of raping a woman at the family 's Palm Beach estate. He has gone on to become a medical doctor. But there is also Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, lieutenant governor of Maryland, considered one of the brightest political prospects in the country. And JFK 's daughter, Caroline. TED SCHWARZ : Caroline is living a normal life, which is an amazing situation. She 's a nonpracticing attorney. She 's an author with some success with books related to the Constitution. She 's a mother. She 's living a normal life - - and that in itself is remarkable -- with some private, personal successes. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) In most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to Congress or to the Senate and certainly to the White House. Only among the Kennedys is it remarkable when someone leads what could be described as a normal life. I spoke with Haynes Johnson and Ron Kessler, two journalists and authors who have written a good deal with the Kennedys.( on camera) If I apply the word " courage " to any of the Kennedys -- appropriate, inappropriate, overdramatized? HAYNES JOHNSON : Well, of course, it 's overdramatized. And it 's part of the mythology. From the Greeks on, we love mythology. But John Kennedy did, mythology not withstanding, do something very great in the Pacific, when he saved those sailors and almost broke his back after PT- 109 went in. And taking them back with his teeth across that great expanse of water. So there was instantaneous courage. His brother Joe, flying on that dangerous mission out of London, a secret mission, the plane blew up. Knowing that it was a highly charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how we -- Hemingway is 100 years old now, and so a lot of us were formed on the Hemingway myth about courage and manliness and all that. Maybe the Kennedys were, too. But clearly, they did take risks for sure. And they did exhibit at times some courage. TED KOPPEL : Be a little careful here, Ron, not to cross the line into amateur psychology. But I speak to you now as someone who spent a lot of time looking into the lives, the motivations, the drive of different members of the Kennedy family. What is it about the Kennedys that causes them always to seem to want to push a little bit too far? RONALD KESSLER : You know, it 's hard to know if it 's genetics, or it 's the culture, or the genetics lead to the culture. But certainly there is a culture in the Kennedy family of taking risks, of knowing no fear, of considering it to be unmanly, if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( ph), who is the family physician. And he said the family knew no fear. The kids were always doing something totally crazy. TED KOPPEL : Was that part of the family, I say was -- is that part of the family ethos? If you 're a Kennedy, you 're not afraid. If you 're a Kennedy, you take risks. If you 're a Kennedy, and so on and so on? HAYNES JOHNSON : Kennedys do n't lose. Kennedys are winners. Kennedys are heroic. We charge the mountains. We save people in the waters. We fly planes and we blow up and we crash, but we sort of come back the next generation. We carry the load. It 's just an incredible kind of thing. It 's not even a clan story. It 's so human a tragedy and so enduring one now, for 30-some years - actually, you go back longer than that. Joe Kennedy, the oldest brother, when he dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Kit Kennedy, she dies in a terrible plane accident. And on and on and on, and the tragedy, and then also this keeping coming back. None of us, any of us, who 've watched American life or world life or written anything has ever seen anything like it. And here we are again. RONALD KESSLER : You know, there 's no question that human beings love to have celebrities -- heroes, kings and queens. We do n't have a king and queen in this country, and we 're always looking for someone that we can admire. The Kennedys played in to that. The Kennedys were very good at manipulating at -- at creating this celebrity status. It 's something that where the reality has been embellished upon. HAYNES JOHNSON : Scottie Reston, James Reston, the great correspondent for the New York Times, the day Kennedy died, said, " We 'll be writing books about him for 300 years, and they will be in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got all of those things in there. It 's like Lady Macbeth. It 's like Macbeth. It 's like Richard III. It 's tragedy. It 's excess. It 's too much success, too early, too young. It 's all of those things. And you had all of it wrapped up in this one family over and over and over again. So we 're all part of that Kennedy lore, that fable, that tragedy. And it 's also something else. These favored people -- young, handsome, good- looking, everything in the world, all the money, all the compounds of life and advantages and so forth, flying off in your own airplane, surrounded by beautiful women, generation after generation, and they all come down in flames like Icarus flying too high to the sun. There 's something -- you name the fable, Ted, you 're a writer, too, and better than I. And it 's all there to be crafted, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. TED KOPPEL :( voice-over) The Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius( ph) warned us never to consider a man fortunate until we know the circumstances of his death. How could we have known 36 years ago what lay in store for this man and what appears to have been the fate of that child. Peter? PETER JENNINGS : Ted, I 'm struck by two things. First of all, how smart James Reston is when he said we 'll be writing books about the Kennedys for 300 years, and how good Haynes Johnson is at getting -- grasping the sense of history he 's written about for so many years in the Washington Post. As you and your staff in Washington prepared this today, what did you finally conclude? TED KOPPEL : You know, I began, Peter, by wondering what we would have been writing or saying about John Kennedy, as they once said about his Uncle Edward, if his name had been John Smith. He was an extraordinarily -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense. He is an extraordinarily gifted, handsome young man. Went to law school, got his degree. Running a magazine. But you have to believe that were it not for the relationship with all these other members of the family, going back two and three generations now, all of them having lived life to the utmost, having lived at the edge, that he is simply the latest in a long line of people who have had great success and ended in a very tragic way. That 's really what 's grabbing us all so hard today, I think, is this notion that it 's happened before. And you just wonder how many more times can it happen to one family. PETER JENNINGS : Ted, thanks very much. I think we 're all struck by the notion that it happened again to someone who was far too young. All the people who have suffered in the Kennedy family, have died in the Kennedy family, have all been so young. A reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was only 46 years old. In that piece by Ted, that eloquent piece about the history of the Kennedy family, you do hear people of a certain generation. When we come back, we 'll talk to some members of the new generation and see how the Kennedy legacy works today @!ANNOUNCER " John F. Kennedy, Jr. : A Nation Waits " will continue in a moment.( Commercial Break) PETER JENNINGS : I 'm Peter Jennings. Again, the waters off Martha 's Vineyard continue to be searched tonight. Pieces of evidence from the aircraft and from the personal possessions of JFK, Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren continue to be picked up and washed ashore. There is n't much doubt in many people 's minds about the final resolution of this tragedy, which appears to have occurred just about 26 hours ago now. Caroline Kennedy, the only notable member of the family who is not up at the compound in Hyannis tonight. She was out West with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the family has gathered there. There was a family Mass around 7:00 this evening. And the National Transportation Safety Board begins in full bore early tomorrow morning to look at this as the accident it was, which they 're trying to bring to some kind of resolution. And we 've been talking off and on this evening about this picture perfect family, the Kennedys, that has lived for so long between triumph and tragedy. I said we wanted to talk to some members of a younger generation than those of us who grew up with President Kennedy in the 1960s. We are joined by Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian who is with us in Washington and has been with us throughout the day. Carl Anthony, colleague of John F. Kennedy, Jr., contributing editor to George magazine, an author writing about first families, and Abigail Pogrebin, the senior editor of Brill 's Content, a magazine about journalism here in New York, who has written about JFK, Jr. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his magazine. I want to start you with, Abigail, and then just simply go to Carl and to Michael. You 've all been listening to this other generation talking about the Kennedys. What 's your take on it all? ABIGAIL POGREBIN, Brill 's Content : I think what 's really obvious here is that my generation has not outgrown the Kennedys. I mean, in terms of being riveted by royalty, it 's just as present. It 's just as strong. And even though he was really a contemporary of mine, I had the privilege of interviewing him for a cover story we did a few months ago. I ca n't deny that walking into that room and shaking his hand did n't make my knees wobble a little bit. And not just because he was handsome. It 's really meeting history. And there 's no denying that that was a huge part of his mystique. PETER JENNINGS : You know, having written about him and having spent time with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits in? ABIGAIL POGREBIN : Well, I think part of what was attractive about him, honestly, were his foibles. I mean, he was n't perfect. He was n't an overachiever. He certainly was a child of privilege. And there 's no denying that he had accomplished a lot. But the fact that he did n't seem to know exactly what he wanted to do. The fact that he seemed to prize his sports life, his active life, that he saw him in kayaks and on rollerblades. And that he did n't seem to, you know, really be lucky in love or know where he was going in that regard. I think all of that endeared him to us. I think his imperfections are part of what countered his kind of -- the fact that he was coming from such privilege and royalty and inaccessibility. PETER JENNINGS : Carl Anthony, you worked with John F. Kennedy, Jr. on the magazine, and you are writing about first families. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY, First Family Historian : Well, I think personally that it was always a greater sign of respect for John or dealing with somebody like John to talk to them as opposed to look at them. I think it not only made me sort of feel more comfortable, but I assume it made him and others like him more comfortable when you engage in something substantive, when you engage in something that was of mutual interest. And in this case, that was the magazine and potential stories for the magazine. But I also had to play a somewhat odd role, too, in that there were inevitably questions that I had or things that came up in my work as a historian which made me sort of cross the line. I remember once a couple of months back, actually it was a year ago, saying to him how the Kennedy compound, for example, should be preserved at some point, like FDR 's Hyde Park, or George Washington 's Mount Vernon. And he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live there. That 's where the family lives. " And so, you know, there was this kind of mutual acknowledgment of the. PETER JENNINGS : History and the contemporary? CARL ANTHONY : Historical -- yeah. But you had to respect the humanity, and just the basic fact that people lived their lives. PETER JENNINGS : Carl, thank you very much for your contribution today. It 's been very useful throughout the day. Michael Beschloss? MICHAEL BESCHLOSS : JFK, Jr. was sort of a post-modern figure. Not of the heroic age of John and Robert Kennedy, but of the ' 90s, where we sort of laugh sometimes at politicians, do n't always take them very seriously. His creation, George magazine, was the very expression of that. PETER JENNINGS : And thank you, Michael, again, for your contributions throughout the day. I want to go back a generation, not maybe a full generation, and talk very briefly to David Nyhan, a Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold even in the summertime waters of the Atlantic. David Nyhan, you 've covered the Kennedys for close on 30 years. You 're on the phone now. So what 's -- I want to know what you think about it in Massachusetts, because the Kennedys are of and about Massachusetts. Voice of DAVID NYHAN, Boston Globe : Listening to Koppel 's piece reminded me that 30 years ago tomorrow, I was dispatched to Chappaquiddick by the AP as a young reporter. And we -- even then, we never had any idea how deeply involved the American public would be with this remarkable family. But I think after listening to your program, Peter, the thing I 'd like to say is that John, Jr. lived a very principled life on his own terms, and his death at least came with him at the controls. This was n't some ugly little man pulling a gun to exact revenge on a dynasty or in the name of some twisted cause. This is a pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died before. And this fellow, he was a remarkable guy. He was a gentle, charming, elegantly mannered young man. Very much his mother 's son. Protected by Jacqueline, sort of a lioness in that cage of Kennedys. He was open-minded, a kind-hearted fellow. Graceful in everything he did. And I 'd like to remember him as that and not for any so-called curse on a rambunctious clan that has meant a great deal to America. PETER JENNINGS : David, thank you very much. I know I 've kept you on the phone for a long time. But thank you for that eloquence in reminding us that this young man lived life on his own terms and, as you put it, in all likelihood, died at the controls. We 'll be back in just a moment.( Commercial Break) PETER JENNINGS : Our broadcast is almost at an end. You can continue to watch this, follow this, throughout the night, of course, on abcnews.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to check in two final places. First at Martha 's Vineyard on the status of the search. ABC 's Bill Blakemore. Bill? BILL BLAKEMORE : Peter, most of the search and rescue operation has been suspended until first light. But there is one helicopter working through the night. It has forward-looking infrared detection. It can detect temperature differences on the surface of the water. So if there is somebody out there swimming, trying to make their way, it would pick them up. But with what they have found, as they 've said, objects with the names of Lauren Bessette on it, a suitcase, and a prescription bottle with Carolyn Bessette Kennedy 's name on it, there does n't seem to be much good news here tonight. PETER JENNINGS : Thank you very much, Bill Blakemore on Martha 's Vineyard, who will be there again in the morning. And as we 've said so many times throughout the day, the Kennedy family, in large number, has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went for a wedding, and they remain for this tragedy. Charlie Gibson is still there. Charlie? CHARLES GIBSON : Peter, just a word about Ethel Kennedy. You know, she was the mother of the bride-to-be today. She had looked so forward today, a day of celebration. Because the last time there was a gathering of the clan here, it was for the death of Michael Kennedy on New Year 's Eve a year and a half ago. She had looked forward to this day so, and with all the tragedies, you know, that Ted mentioned in his piece, that had befallen the family. He did n't mention that her two parents died in a plane crash as well. So two siblings of John Kennedy died in plane crashes, her parents died in plane crashes, the plane crash that broke the back of Senator Ted Kennedy. There 's a lot of people in his family who do n't like flights and do n't like planes. And that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have any sense this late in the evening of what the family is doing, has done through the evening, expects to do tomorrow? CHARLES GIBSON : They 've battened down the hatches, Peter. You know, we were hearing about the family mood for a long time, until about noon, and as the reality sank in and the realization that this was not going to end happily began to sink in, as we got word of the debris coming on the beach at Martha 's Vineyard, they 've battened down the hatches. And we have n't heard anything from them. PETER JENNINGS : Thank you very much, Charlie, and everybody else at ABC News who has contributed to this day-long coverage. Tomorrow morning at 8:30 Eastern Time, there will be a special edition of This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts. Much of tomorrow on ABC will be taken up by the British Open. If any developments occur in the Kennedy tragedy, we shall be here immediately. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good night.
