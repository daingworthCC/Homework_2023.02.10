242441 @!TED-KOPPEL : voice-over A mystery that 's been unsolved for more than a decade, the " October surprise. " Did Ronald Reagan 's campaign really delay the release of American hostages in Iran? Tonight, we 'll talk with the author of a book who says yes, and with a journalist who says it 's all nonsense @!ANNOUNCER This is ABC News Nightline. Reporting from Washington, Ted Koppel @!KOPPEL Perhaps it 'll be of some small comfort to those of you who 've been following what 's come to be known as the October surprise story if I confess that several of us here at Nightline who 've been following the story for years and concentrating on it with varying degrees of intensity for months, that we, too, are confused. I, for one, find myself equally uncomfortable with those who are certain that the case has been made, that members of the Reagan-Bush campaign helped delay the release of American hostages in Iran back in 1980, just as uncomfortable with them as I am with those who declare the whole story a farce. At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed conversation that allegedly took place in the summer of 1980, between an Iranian envoy of the Ayatollah Khomeini and William Casey, who would become Ronald Reagan 's CIA director, but who was then his campaign manager. My source for this conversation was an Iranian arms dealer, Jamshid Hashemi, who claims to have been present at the meeting. His account of the conversation did not have Casey asking the Iranians for a delay in the release of American hostages ; quite the contrary. Hashemi quotes Casey as asking that the hostages be released as soon as possible. It was the Iranians who said that such a release would never take place before the elections, and ultimately the Iranians who said that the release would n't take place until after the inauguration. For some reason, that piece of information seems equally unpalatable to both sides, to Reaganites perhaps because it would require admitting that such meetings took place before any one of them held government office, to October surprise advocates because the thrust of their conspiracy theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay the release of the hostages. Nightline correspondent Jeff Greenfield provides some background for the continuing debate. JEFF GREENFIELD, ABC News : voice-over According to Gary Sick 's book, October Surprise, two key series of meetings took place between Reagan campaign operatives and Iranian official. The first, in late July and in August in Madrid, where a general agreement was reached to delay the hostage release until after the presidential election, in return for arms. Reagan campaign director William Casey, it is charged, was at those meetings. The second, in mid-October in Paris, where final details of the deal were negotiated. Casey, national security council operative Donald Gregg and, by some accounts, GOP vice presidential nominee George Bush were at those meetings. GARY SICK, Author, " October Surprise " : I take the evidence that persuaded me and I lay it out for anybody to look at, and then I would hope that a reader would make a fair judgment at the end. And I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, will find it hard to say, " Nothing happened. " GREENFIELD : voice-over The principal source on the alleged Madrid meetings is Jamshid Hashemi, an Iranian arms merchant, who says he and his late brother, Cyrus, arranged the meetings. He has alleged that Reagan campaign director and future CIA chief William Casey and two other unnamed Americans met with Iranians, including Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi. Last June, Nightline reported that records from a Madrid hotel appeared to confirm that the Hashemi brothers were in fact in Madrid in late July and in August of 1980. When it came to the whereabouts of William Casey, we looked at news accounts, appointment books, and listened to the recollections of Reagan campaign workers, and we found a three-day period at the end of July where Casey 's whereabouts could not be accounted for. Further, a July 30th, 1980 New York Times story reported that Casey was planning to return that day from a trip abroad. In the wake of these and other reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, with a strong partisan tilt to the assumptions. Rep. ROBERT TORRICELLI,( D), New Jersey : The problem has been that there have been so many people with nearly identical stories over so many years, making the same charges, that it 's remarkably suspicious, and at least warrants inquiry at this point. Rep. HENRY HYDE,( R), Illinois : So far, all of the evidence that I have seen are from people who have been thoroughly discredited, unreliable, and it just seems to me this does smack of a political adventure 10 years after the fact, and still an effort to nail Ronald Reagan with some sort of smoking gun @!GREENFIELD During our original reporting last June, Nightline talked with a number of people who 'd worked closely with Bill Casey during the 1980 Reagan campaign. None of them had any recollection of an overseas trip by Casey in late July ; indeed, many of them said it would have been almost impossible for Casey to have left the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day gap in Casey 's whereabouts did new information surface about Casey 's travels in late July of 1980, when the Madrid meeting supposedly took place. voice-over New information has also surfaced about the credibility of some of the leading sources for this story, and two national magazines, Newsweek and The New Republic, report their conclusions that the October surprise never happened. Steve Emerson was one of the New Republic 's reporters. STEVE EMERSON, " The New Republic " : I have concluded that there was no October surprise, that 's the bottom line, that all of the sources contradict each other irrefutably, that there is no consistency whatsoever and, most importantly of all, there is no evidence at all to support the major contentions of the October surprise conspiratorialists @!GREENFIELD voice-over We do know one place where Bill Casey was at the end of July, 1980. As Nightline reported some months ago, Casey was in London for a conference on World War II. He was photographed on the evening of July 28th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's unclear whether Casey 's whereabouts can be fully, conclusively traced. Newsweek and The New Republic claim that an attendance chart for the conference shows that Casey was there for most of the day of July 28th. Nightline has interviewed the secretary for the conference planning committee. We also talked with some 20 participants. They can not confirm Casey 's presence for this day. And Craig Unger, a freelance journalist, says the attendance chart is not conclusive. CRAIG UNGER, Journalist : Well, Casey is penciled in, that 's a British tradition, in, " I 'll pencil you in for lunch, " but he is not inked in as having definitively have been there, and no one- I talked to the man who did the- took the attendance there, and he thinks it 's likely that Casey was there, but he 's absolutely not positive @!GREENFIELD voice-over But officials at the Royal Army Medical College in London say they have discovered documents showing that Casey slept there on the evening of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 28th. Does that make the story of Madrid meetings in late July impossible? That depends on who you ask. Mr. EMERSON : The new information provides further evidence that he actually stayed in London for those three days, in tending a conference, making impossible the allegations of consecutive meetings in Madrid, just physically impossible. Mr. SICK : From my point of view, the fact that he 's missing for a day and a half, or that he is identified for a day and a half in London, at that conference, really does not- does n't preclude anything, as far as his presence in Madrid @!GREENFIELD What about the claims of mid-October Paris meetings? Secret Service and campaign records strongly suggest that neither George Bush nor William Casey could have been in Paris when supposed eyewitnesses say they were there. Moreover, two key sources for the Paris story, self-professed CIA operative Richard Brenneke and one-time Israeli intelligence operative Ari Ben-Menashi, have both made many assertions that have proven demonstrably false. Mr. EMERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people, that he has fallen victim to their naivete and their willing intention to manipulate him, and that he is endorsing something that simply never occurred and he is making a terrible mistake. Mr. SICK : I do n't trust anybody. I do n't trust Jamshid Hashemi, I do n't trust Ari Ben- Menashi, I do n't trust Ronald Reagan and I do n't trust the Israeli government. All of these people have probably lied at one time or another, and in some cases we 've caught them at it, doing it. Does that mean that everything they say then is a lie? No. It does not @!GREENFIELD By Thanksgiving, the House and the Senate will decide whether to go forward with their formal investigations. If they do, it is possible that the subpoena power of Congress may be able to put to rest a story that literally years of investigation has still not resolved once and for all. I 'm Jeff Greenfield for Nightline @!KOPPEL When we come by, we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the author of October Surprise, and Steve Emerson, who rejects the idea that there was an October surprise deal. Commercial break KOPPEL : Joining us from our Washington studios are Gary Sick, whose book, October Surprise, argues that Ronald Reagan 's associates did, in fact, delay the release of the 52 American hostages in Iran, and Steve Emerson, an investigative journalist and author whose recent article in The New Republic concluded that the October surprise deal never happened. Very quickly - and I realize in the context of this kind of a brief interview it 's hard to do - but Gary Sick, the two or three reasons that most compellingly convince you that the October surprise did take place. GARY SICK, Author " October Surprise " : This has been a very gradual process for me. As you know very well, I started out as being one of those who said that it never could have happened, I believed that it could n't happen, and then I started working seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for about three years. And over that time, I have gradually accumulated more and more evidence which simply ca n't be explained any other way. There are- KOPPEL : For example? Mr. SICK : -well, there are a series of coincidences, just on the broad sense of the thing, without getting into the details of sources and so forth, that, for instance, in October 1980, things were going very well for the Carter administration in its negotiations with Iran. The Iranians were showing a great deal of interest in getting arms from the United States. During the period of time that the meetings took place in Paris, everything reversed. The Iranians went into that meeting believing that they were going to get rid of the hostages and end the embargo within a period of three to four weeks. They came out of the meeting saying, " No more negotiations with Carter, and that ends that. " And moreover, " We 're not interested in arms anymore. " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they found arms elsewhere, and those arms showed up later on, when the hostages got released, just minutes after Reagan came in, suddenly there was a flood of arms. So in the broad sense, these pieces have begun to fit together and there are, I think, dozens, if not hundreds, of others which I 've tried to set out as clearly as possible in the book that I wrote @!KOPPEL Steve Emerson, it is, as you know, one of the most difficult tasks that a journalist can set himself, to prove that something did not happen. Let me ask you the same kind of question that I asked Gary Sick, but from the flip side. What, more than anything else, convinces you that October surprise is just a figment of a few overactive imaginations? STEVEN EMERSON, Investigative Reporter : Well, as an investigative reporter, I went into this trying to find out whether certain things happened, and I basically concluded, based on interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's akin to the Hitler diaries hoax. Essentially, this revolves around three or four people that have consistently embellished lies about themselves, inserted themselves as in the center of major events and have fabricated major, major stories. They are documented perjurers and fabricators, and the whole frustrating thing for a reporter is to see how this thing has evolved in the last four years. When it was first suggested in 1987 that a conspiracy existed, everyone focused on George Bush and William Casey in Paris. Then it slowly materialized, in fact this year it is documented that the primary source for that allegation was an abject liar who was actually in Oregon at the time that he said in Paris, everything shifted to Madrid, shifted to William Casey. Now it turns out that William Casey was at a London conference, now one of the conspiratorialists is suggesting that because somebody penciled in a check rather than wrote it in ink, he is somehow less sure of his attendance. This whole thing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter is, every single source that Mr. Sick relies on, every single one, has been indicted or the subject of a federal investigation, and only had a sudden memory recall on the October surprise after they were indicted. Now, I 'll tell you something, if I were indicted tomorrow for murder or for robbery, I 'd invoke the October surprise, I 'd have the perfect alibi @!KOPPEL Let me just ask you, you said you have spoken to a number of people all around the world. I think you 'll agree that Jamshid Hashemi was one of the key witnesses to this, at least claims to have been an eyewitness, an earwitness to the meetings in Madrid. What did he tell you? Mr. EMERSON : I did not speak to Jamshid Hashemi, because he did not want to speak to me. Neither did Ali Ben-Menashi. And these are characters whose statements I read in your interviews with them, as well as with Frontline 's, the PBS station did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me because I was not going to report what they said uncritically. They wanted to be interviewed by Gary Sick, who endorsed their whole fantasy, hook, line and sinker, and that 's the problem with Gary Sick 's reporting @!KOPPEL Well, let me, without getting into an argument as to whether or not I was prepared to accept everything he said uncritically, turn to Gary Sick and let him respond. Mr. SICK : You know, we 've been talking a great deal about sources, and one of the points that I think is worth making is the phantom sources that have not appeared. We have identified at least three major times when William Casey was supposedly out of the country, at meetings, meeting with Iranians. There 's an eyewitness to that, there are four other witnesses, four other individuals who have backed that up, corroborated it independently - and not all of them have been indicted, by the way, that is simply not true. And as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sources that I cite, or the corroborative sources. We have identified- Mr. EMERSON : Let me tell you- Mr. SICK : -we 've identified three different times when William Casey has been out of the country, and if this had happened during the Carter administration, and somebody had made this kind of an accusation, I can tell you, there would have been a flood of people coming forward saying, " I was with him that day, " " I know where he was, " " He would n't do such a thing. " In this case there 's been dead silence. His secretary can not recall- Mr. EMERSON : Listen, Gary, I have no vested- Mr. SICK : -there are no records of where he was then- Mr. EMERSON : -I have no vested interest. I think you should- Mr. SICK : -and there 's no way that anybody else has stepped forward, this is as if Casey was on the moon during those periods of time. Mr. EMERSON : Gary- Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where was he during those periods of time? Mr. EMERSON : Gary, I have no vested interest in supporting the Reagan administration or debunking them, I 've written a book, Secret Warriors, a couple of years ago that severely criticized the activities of William Casey and the Reagan-Bush administrations in their role in the Iran/Contra affair. I do n't have a vested interest. If anyone does, you do, to a certain extent, because you are trying to rehabilitate the Carter administration 's debacle in Iran. Now, as far as your sources, and this goes to the heart of the issue, if you name your sources, I will go down the list with you methodically and show you how each one is either serving time, was indicted or was prosecuted for conspiring to illegally ship weapons to Iran, to another country. Mr. SICK : You know, I would be very happy if the people who ran this operation, Casey and all, had in fact hired Boy Scout leaders and church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that some of the people that they chose were, in fact, money launderers, arms dealers, and people who knew how to do the kinds of things that were needed to be done crosstalk @!KOPPEL As indeed - if I may interrupt for a moment - as indeed a number of the people who were later involved in the Iran/Contra affair turned out to be also. Let 's just take a quick break, and we 'll continue with both of you in just a moment. Commercial break KOPPEL : Just as a matter of curiosity, I 'd like to ask both of you - Steve Emerson, let me ask you first - you did n't pick up in your article, although you did quote a number of things that Nightline reported back in June, on my quoting Cyrus Hashemi to the effect that Casey initially went in there and said, " We want those hostages out as quickly as possible. " It was, indeed, directly contrary to what had been reported prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ask why? Mr. EMERSON : I did n't make mention of it. This was not a book, I only had nine pages in The New Republic, and we just- KOPPEL : It 's rather a significant item, do n't you think, that the very charge that was made, namely, that the Reagan administration went in there to delay the release of the hostages, was denied by the very man who is the key witness? Mr. EMERSON : I was trying to look at the larger charge, which is whether Casey met with Hashemi. That was really the issue that 's going to lay to rest whether the October surprise conspiracy happened or not, and that 's the essence of the investigation. If you look at the article, which obviously you have, you will see that I 've examined the primary sources, including Jamshid Hashemi, who allegedly had all of this blackmail information on William Casey, that he had a secret deal, why did n't Jamshid Hashemi, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the charges dropped when he was threatening everything he could to try to get the charges dropped? KOPPEL : Interesting question. Let me have Gary Sick respond to that, and then I 'd also like to have him respond to the fact why he made no mention of what Jamshid Hashemi said with that regard, either, but first of all, if you 'd just respond to what Steve Emerson said. Mr. SICK : Well, Jamshid Hashemi told me, and I- that Casey said to him, said in the meeting that they wanted the hostages released to the Republicans, and I took that as pretty good evidence that he wanted them released later, and after the election, and not necessarily- at that point it was n't a matter of delay, because the hostages were n't about to be released, the hostages were sitting in their prison in Teheran, nothing was being done with them, nothing was happening. So, in fact, that would be, in any sense, expediting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Emerson was saying a moment ago, though, why would not this man who was sitting there- after all, with the best blackmail information in the world, I mean, he has the capacity of holding all kinds of blackmail capacity over the heads of the Reagan administration and Bill Casey in particular. Why did n't he use it? Mr. SICK : Jamshid Hashemi- well, actually, the Reagan administration, when it came in, suddenly removed the surveillance on Cyrus Hashemi, which had been put in place by the Carter administration. This was ended suddenly, in February. The indictment was brought three years later, and it was brought by the Customs department, and was not brought by the federal officials. And, in fact, the federal officials later on were not exactly excited about it. We know from CIA documents that have been released subsequently that Cyrus Hashemi, Jamshid 's brother, was in fact in contact with Casey directly through an intermediary, John Shaheen, who was carrying messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those is, " Cyrus Hashemi tries to play hardball. " And clearly some interesting messages were going back and forth. I ca n't explain why he did n't talk to- Mr. EMERSON : In those documents, Gary- Mr. SICK : -his lawyer, but I do n't know what he said to Casey, as a matter of fact. Mr. EMERSON : -those documents, Gary, if you would report exactly what they said, show clearly that Cyrus and Jamshid Hashemi were trying to dredge up everything they had on the Reagan administration to get the indictments dropped. Mr. SICK : And it does not spell out what they- Mr. EMERSON : And they did not- Mr. SICK : -it does not spell out what they were saying. Mr. EMERSON : -yes it does spell- Mr. SICK : It does not. Mr. EMERSON : -it does- it 's a Department of Justice memorandum of conversation, I 'll be happy to provide it to you after the show @!KOPPEL Gentlemen, we 're down quite literally to our last 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and ask you to respond very quickly, Gary Sick first of all, do you think that there should be a congressional investigation? There is some doubt on the Hill now whether there will be. Mr. SICK : There is- I simply set forward as much evidence as I could find. It 's evidence that I find extremely persuasive. I think anybody who looks at that book will find it extremely persuasive and I 'll challenge it against anybody, and there should be an investigation @!KOPPEL Steve Emerson, do you think there should be? Mr. EMERSON : It 's a good question. I do n't think it 's the role of me to say whether there should be. All I can say to you is that I 've thoroughly investigated this with a fellow author, other- Newsweek has, London Sunday Times has, even the GAO has, the General Accounting Office has, and they have concluded beyond any reasonable doubt that there is not a shred of evidence to support the notion that a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both very much. I 'll be back in a moment with a program note. Commercial break KOPPEL : Tomorrow, on World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, a return visit to a prison boot camp to see if an innovative form of incarceration can keep young offenders from returning to prison. That 's our report for tonight. I 'm Ted Koppel in Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.
