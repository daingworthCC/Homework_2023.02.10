234841 @!NEAL-CONAN-HOST : This is WEEKLY EDITION. I 'm Neal Conan. This past Wednesday, as allegations involving President Clinton and a former intern erupted, reporters repeatedly pressed White House spokesman Mike McCurry on when they could expect the president to respond. MIKE MCCURRY, WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN : We have, you know, an interview with PBS, and an interview with NPR lined up -- fortuitous bit of scheduling. That 's probably a lot better than the $25 pledge I sent in during pledge week. LAUGHTER Yeah... CONAN : As it turned out, PBS and NPR were first to hear the president deny that there was any inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the former intern. In a moment, we 'll talk about how that interview happened and how it changed once the story broke. But first, we 'll hear part of the interview, which was conducted by NPR 's Robert Siegel and Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, NPR REPORTER : Mr. President, where do you think this comes from? Did you have any kind of relationship with her that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE UNITED STATES : Mara, I 'm going to do my best to cooperate with the investigation. I want to know what they want to know from me. I think it 's more important for me to tell the American people that it was n't an improper relations -- I did n't ask anybody to lie and I intend to cooperate. And I think that 's all I should say right now, so I can get back to the work of the country @!LIASSON Mm-hmm. But you -- you 're not able to say whether you had any conversations with her about her testimony? CLINTON : I think it would be... LIASSON : Had any conversations at all... CLINTON :... I think given the state of this investigation, it would be inappropriate for me to say more. I 've said everything I think that I need to say now. I 'm going to be cooperative and we 'll work through it. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST : But is the fact that, in this case as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was outfitted with a wire, with a microphone, to record conversations with her at the instruction of the Whitewater counsel, does that -- does that disturb you? Do you regard that Mr. Starr is playing the inquisitor here in this case? CLINTON : Well, that 's a question the American people will have to ask and answer and the press will have ask and answer, the bar will have to ask and answer, but it 's inappropriate for me to comment on it at this time. I just have to cooperate and I 'll do that @!CONAN Robert Siegel joins us in the studio now. Thanks for speaking with us @!SIEGEL Sure, Neal @!CONAN How did this interview come about? SIEGEL : Well, this was a -- a scheduled interview, scheduled a week in advance with the president, as one of several interviews he granted prior to the State of the Union Address. And it had nothing -- the scheduling had nothing whatever to do with this story concerning Monica Lewinsky @!CONAN So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade I guess as " a wide ranging-interview " -- you 've -- to talk to the president? SIEGEL : Yes. I guess I wanted to ask mostly about the Middle East peace process, and Mara wanted to ask mostly about entitlements in Social Security @!CONAN Obviously, you do a lot of preparation for an interview with the President of the United States. And there 's no such thing as unimportant interview with the president. But when did you realize that this was going to be something rather different? SIEGEL : That morning. And more so that afternoon, watching the White House press grill Mike McCurry, trying to get more information out of him. It was clear that the people with the next interviews up, meaning Jim Lehrer, Mort Kondracki( ph) of Roll Call magazine and us, that we bore the burden of getting some elaboration of the president 's written statement @!CONAN Now, the interview covered the Middle East, Iraq, the budget surplus, the Unabomber trial. Was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time for? SIEGEL : No actually, we made it down through the list, the outline that Mara and I had drawn up -- and went over many times and amended. As it was, I think... CONAN : I assume your editors wanted to have a finger in that pie... SIEGEL : Our editors had a finger, but I would n't -- you know, I would n't grant them a whole hand. And we 'd mapped out the interview and we pretty well got through it. We would have asked him at the end why Clintonism -- last subject, did n't seem to work for the Democratic Party running for Congress or governorships the way it worked for him. At that point, my call was -- we had about 30 seconds left -- and he was running it about a minute an answer, so, no chance @!CONAN Is there tension between the respect due the President of the United States and the fear that, on a lot of these questions, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsed positions? Did you hope that you would get him to say something beyond what he 'd said before, or is this one of those situations where you 're going to get what he 's going to give you? SIEGEL : You 're going to get what he 's going to give you. However, at any moment that you interview a president I think, something is newsworthy, something is expected from him, because it 's that day. Now what we 've all focused on is the fact that that day, the story about Monica Lewinsky came out. But that day also, he 'd been up into the early hours of the morning with Netanyahu. And Arafat was coming in the next day. And Richard Butler, the weapons inspector in Iraq, was -- was getting nowhere with the Iraqis. So, lots of other things were happening that were newsworthy. We were -- we were hoping he would commit to spending a budget surplus on Social Security, but as he said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union message @!CONAN Was there any temptation to try to go for something off the wall, something a little lighter? SIEGEL : Yes, there was a temptation, but we resisted it @!CONAN Mm-hmm. LAUGHTER SIEGEL : You only have so many minutes in the Oval Office with the president and I -- you know, I would never go into that interview expecting find some communication with Bill Clinton that no one else has found before. I mean, he 's a busy man. I 'm one of three interviews in a row that he 's doing. And he 's -- he 's being open and candid in the way that a sitting president, who 's trying to communicate his positions prior to the State of the Union, is going to be open and candid. But, he 's not going to be the patient on the psychiatrist 's couch, that 's for sure @!CONAN Thanks very much @!SIEGEL Sure. Good to talk with you, Neal @!CONAN NPR 's Robert Siegel. #
