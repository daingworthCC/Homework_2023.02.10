5000741 @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Okay, right now we 're going to move on now to a new twist in the case of that missing mother of five, Jennifer Dulos. Her estranged husband 's lawyer now claiming this could be a " Gone Girl " case, suggesting Dulos faked her own disappearance, but her family is firing back. Eva Pilgrim here with the details. Good morning, Eva. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5OC@6 Good morning, guys. It 's been more than a month since Jennifer Dulos vanished. Her estranged husband and his longtime girlfriend facing charges in her disappearance. And now his legal team is offering their own theory on what happened. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5VO@6 Overnight, a shocking new theory from the attorney of the estranged husband of missing Connecticut mom, Jennifer Dulos. The lawyer for Fotis Dulos telling ABC News they believe Jennifer might be responsible for her own disappearance, saying " We are actively investigating the possibility that this is a " Gone Girl " -type case and are considering the possibility that no third party was involved in foul play. " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking exclusively to ABC News. @1CARRIE-LUFT-SPOKESP@3 : She is not, in any way, the sort of person who would vanish. This is not a woman who would ever, ever leave her children. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5VO@6 Fotis Dulos ' lawyer is now claiming that Jennifer, an accomplished writer, worked on a 500-page manuscript similar to the 2012 best-seller " Gone Girl, " where a woman in a troubled marriage fakes her own death in order to frame her husband. That book was later turned into a hit movie. @1KIM-DICKENS-GONE-G@3 : So, your wife has no friends here. Is she kind of standoffish, ivy league, rubs people the wrong way? @1BEN-AFFLECK-GONE-G@3 : She 's from New York. She 's complicated. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5VO@6 Luft remembers the manuscript in question, saying it was written long before Jennifer was married and does n't resemble " Gone Girl " at all. @1CARRIE-LUFT-SPOKESP@3 : I think that drawing any comparison to a work of fiction does an incredible disservice to the family. This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our real life that someone we love is missing. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5VO@6 This case has garnered national attention. Jennifer disappeared after dropping her kids off at school on May 24th. A friend of Jennifer 's telling " The New York Post " this weekend that Jennifer was afraid for her life. The mother of five was locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with her estranged husband. Authorities say they discovered blood stains in her garage and believe she was the victim of a serious physical assault. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @5VO@6 Earlier this month, Fotis Dulos and his longtime live-in girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, were charged with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence and hindering prosecution. According to their arrest warrant, surveillance video from the night Jennifer went missing captured two people police suspect to be Fotis and Troconis tossing bags, including a blood-stained sponge, into trash cans across the city of Hartford. Both have pled not guilty and are out on bail. Dulos seen out jogging recently wearing his ankle bracelet. @1EVA-PILGRIM-ABC-NEW@3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Fotis in August. As for the Dulos ' five kids, let 's not forget about them, they 're currently staying with Jennifer 's family. George. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Okay, Eva, thanks very much. Let 's bring in our Chief Legal Analyst Dan Abrams for more on this pretty audacious defense. @1DAN-ABRAMS-ABC-NEWS@3 : @5OC@6 Yeah, to - to basically make a - a great headline, yes, it does, to say it 's comparison to this movie, etcetera, but the problem for them is that you have this videotape. If they can link back him to 30 different locations in Hartford where they found blood-stained evidence, her blood on clothing, on sponges. They were also able to link back cell phone, his cell phone, to those areas. If they 're able to connect him and her to those 30 locations of dumping items and where her blood was found, then this does n't make any sense. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 So, then - then how would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public? @1DAN-ABRAMS-ABC-NEWS@3 : @5OC@6 You know, look, my guess is they 're going to say that it 's not him on the video, right? They 're going to say, " Yes, it looks like his car. Yes, his cell phone says he was in the area. Yes, it may appear to look something like him. But it was n't him who was dumping those items. " That 's - that 's my guess as - as to what they 're going to say. And then, suddenly they have a little more leeway here. The problem is that once we see this manuscript and it sounds like, you know, those who 've seen it are saying it has nothing to do with - with " Gone Girl, " then you 've got an even bigger problem for them. I mean, this is, as you point out, a very audacious effort. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Can you get a conviction on - on murder if the body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been many cases where there 's no body found and there 's a murder case brought. It makes it harder in any case to win a murder case without a - without a body, but it is certainly not impossible. You can still present all the evidence that the person has died, but that often becomes the defense is you ca n't even prove that the person is dead and that becomes something that the prosecution has to overcome. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Dan Abrams, thanks very much. @1DAN-ABRAMS-ABC-NEWS@3 : @5OC@6 Yep. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Michael.
