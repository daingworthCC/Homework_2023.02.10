223341 @!THIS-IS-A-RUSH-TRA : Around-the-clock search for the wreckage of John Kennedy, Jr. ' s plane, high-tech ships on the surface and under the sea. Divers battle murky, frigid water for clues to what happened that night. Good morning, America. DIANE SAWYER, ABC News : It 's Wednesday, July 21, 1999. CHARLES GIBSON : I 'm Charles Gibson. Good to have old friends back after a couple of days away. And we do n't know what it means yet, but there seems to be a hubbub of activity up on Cape Cod and at Martha 's Vineyard. DIANE SAWYER : That 's right. For one thing, investigators are canceling interviews in order to remain out at sea, which may or may not mean something. But this morning, we are going to have the latest developments on the search off Martha 's Vineyard. And also a clearer picture of John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s final maneuver, shedding new light on the path of the plane and its precipitous fall. CHARLES GIBSON : And we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally. We have an exclusive interview with a fraternity brother of John 's. He 's going to tell us about a different side of his friend of 20 years. DIANE SAWYER : And turning to other news this morning, it is a testament to a new life built by a woman who was an FBI fugitive for two decades that her friends have put up their own money for her million-dollar bail. And we 're going to talk with one of her closest friends to find out how and why. CHARLES GIBSON : Also ahead, the first multipart interview, I guess, with Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura. It 's an interview that we conducted yesterday. He is a very interesting man, and we 're going to run some of it today, tomorrow, and on Friday as well, get his sense of how he feels about his first six months in office. He 's going to talk today about Hillary Clinton, the Senate candidate, and he has some rather sharp things to say. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential contenders. He is a -- his thoughts and opinions are rather interesting, and I hope you 'll stay tuned for that. DIANE SAWYER : " Rather interesting " turns out to be the understated adjective of the year. CHARLES GIBSON : Well, he 's -- he is outspoken, to say the least. DIANE SAWYER : He is. Also, another exclusive interview this morning, with tennis champion Andre Agassi. And we 'll bring you the greatest women in rock and roll, and you can argue with it if you want. But first, the rest of the news. Here 's Antonio Mora. ANTONIO MORA, ABC News : Thanks, Diane, and good morning, everyone. It has been a long night and should be another long day for searchers off the coast of Martha 's Vineyard. For the latest on the investigation of the crash of John F. Kennedy, Jr. ' s plane, we go to ABC 's Lisa Stark at Otis Air Base on Cape Cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning? LISA STARK, ABC News : Well, good morning, Antonio. This morning, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jim Hall, and Admiral Richard Larrabee, who 's running the Coast Guard effort here, are both out on the water. They are visiting all the vessels out there, getting a firsthand look at the recovery operation on the sea. Now, here on land, investigators with the safety board are reanalyzing radar data, learning more about the path of the plane as it approached Martha 's Vineyard, always normal until about 20 miles out, and then the plane descended to 2,300 feet, and then began to turn to the right and went back up to 2,600 feet. Now, after that, just about a minute later, the plane began another turn, which probably would have put it in line with the airport. And then, chief investigator Robert Pearce explains what happened next. ROBERT PEARCE, NTSB Investigator : Thirty seconds into the maneuver, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid rate of descent. The rate of descent may have been greater than 5,000 feet per minute. LISA STARK : Now, radar contact was lost. The plane went below radar contact at 1,100 feet. Now, that last turn to the right would have put the plane heading in the opposite direction of Martha 's Vineyard. Bob Pearce, Robert Pearce, was asked whether that 's the sign of a confused pilot. He said he could not venture an opinion on that. But one very experienced pilot who I talked with who flies into this airport all the time said if you 're flying under visual rules and you get into a situation where you can not see at all, one of the main things you do is reverse direction, turn around, go the direction you just came from. It 's unclear if that 's what JFK Jr. was trying to do. Antonio? ANTONIO MORA : Thanks, Lisa. Lisa Stark at Otis Air Base on Cape Cod. Plans for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister are in the works. JFK Jr. ' s sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and other members of the family have been talking with a priest at a New York church about a service. The priest says nothing has been decided yet. He hopes to know more about the plans today. The battle over tax cuts is expected to come to a vote in the House today. The Republican leadership wants to slash taxes by nearly $800 billion over 10 years. But any vote will be very close. Democrats and some Republicans say a smaller reduction, around $300 billion, would be more fiscally responsible. Wall Street is coming off a rough day. The Dow Jones industrials shrank by 191 points yesterday, the fifth biggest point drop of the year. Most analysts say investors are just trying to lock in profits because, they say, there is no real sign of weakness in the overall economy. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference has canceled its annual convention in South Carolina this weekend. The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its capitol dome. Other civil rights groups also plan to boycott South Carolina until the flag is removed. Former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah is returning home to Minnesota while she awaits trial. Soliah was released yesterday by a California judge after posting a million dollars ' bond. She was arrested last month on charges of attempted murder that date back to the 1970s. Soliah says she is looking forward to returning to her family. KATHLEEN SOLIAH, Former SLA Member : I 'm a very fortunate woman to have a loving family and to have such wonderful friends who 've been so supportive and who 've worked so hard for me, and put up their houses and their retirement funds to get me out of jail. ANTONIO MORA : Later this half hour, Diane will talk with a friend of Soliah 's who is one of 250 people who helped raise her bail money. Thirty-eight years after it flew in space, Gus Grissom 's Mercury capsule, " Liberty Bell 7, " has been salvaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when its hatch blew open too early just after splashing down from the second manned U.S. space mission. And finally, more from space. The Apollo 11 astronauts were honored yesterday 30 years to the day after they landed on the moon, July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins received the Langley Gold Medal from Vice President Gore at the Smithsonian. That 's the news coming up on 7:07.( Weather)
