247941 LIANE HANSEN, Host : The Fourth of July came and went a month ago, but here in Washington, Friday was ' independence day ' for the House of Representatives. The Senate is still in session, and rhetorical fireworks continued to explode at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. At a news conference last Tuesday, President Clinton declared the Republican-led Congress was ' on the wrong track, ' and threatened to veto no less than five pieces of legislation. The hit list includes bills that would gut environmental protections, deregulate the telecommunications industry, roll back gun control laws, and lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. The president even threatened to shut down Congress itself by brandishing his pen over the bill that pays for its operations. Also, the Waco hearings concluded, more hearings this week on Whitewater this week are scheduled, and in our analyst 's chair is Weekend Edition commentator Fred Barnes to discuss all of these. Hi, Fred. giggles FRED BARNES, Political Analyst : Hi, Liane. LIANE HANSEN : Nice to see again. FRED BARNES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much. I came back to the fact that the president up until now has only vetoed one bill since he 's been president. It cut spending from the ' 95 budget ; new version negotiated. The president signed it last week. Now, we have five bills the sites. What about this move politically. I mean, does he really have his ducks up in a row, and he 's going to pick them off one by one? FRED BARNES : Well, some are never going to get to him. He 's talking about rolling back gun control laws. That 's not going to happen, even in this Congress. They 're not going to pass any new gun control laws, but they 're not going to roll them back, at least in the short run. So, I do n't think that 's going to be a real worry. But look, he 's engaging, he 's joining the game. He wants to be a part of the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first six months of the year. That was bad politics. Now, he 's gotten in there, he 's got his budget which he says should be balanced in- well, it was ten, now nine years. He 's got his proposals, he 's joined the game. This has helped him politically, and this also what a president is supposed to do. I think he is going to issue some vetoes, and it 's going to be very much like the one you talked about, Liane. He vetoed, Republicans made some changes - not huge ones, but they made some - and then he signed it. I think we 're going to see a good bit more of that, and the president can claim, well, I helped shape this legislation. LIANE HANSEN : What areas do you think that that 's going to happen? FRED BARNES : Well, it 's certainly going to happen in the spending bills. He 's going to veto any number of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put some things in that he wants - you know, funding for the AmeriCorps and a few other things, probably more education spending and more job training spending. They did both of those in that earlier rescission bill. And then he 'll sign it. The president, I 'm convinced, is on a signing strategy. He does n't want the so-called ' train wreck, ' though he threatens it. He wants to sign bills and he wants to be able to say next year, you know, I worked with Congress, we had bipartisanship, and I got the balanced budget I 'd been talking about, and that welfare reform I promised in 1992. LIANE HANSEN : So, he 'll still, in spite of these vetoes- still be pursuing a common ground philosophy and way of operating with Congress here? FRED BARNES : I think so ; that 's his phrase for bipartisanship, and this makes about two-thirds of the Democrats in Congress furious. But it 's certainly helping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many people, including me, thought was going to be a terrible one from him - has really improved his chances of reelection. LIANE HANSEN : Really? FRED BARNES : Mm-hmm. LIANE HANSEN : Let 's talk about some of these areas, particularly the last bill that passed - because you and I have discussed it before - the telecommunications bill. If I 'm not mistaken, you said this was a good thing the last time you were here. You thought prices would go down. FRED BARNES : Well, I think so. Well, clearly they 're not going to go down in cable TV rates instantly, because those would be deregulated and they 'd go up and there would be no competition there yet for the monopoly cable TV operators. But in most areas, I think in the long run - meaning, you know, three or four years - you 're going to have competition and prices are going to go down. But the president 's going to veto this bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so. I think it would have to be changed substantially. And that 's a veto that Republicans may not have the votes to override. In the House, they did, but it 's unclear in the Senate. That 's going to be a tough fight. We may not see the so-called ' Tel-Com Bill ' as they call it on the Hill actually get through this year. LIANE HANSEN : War and peace was also part of the legislation that was passed. There is the bill that 's passed to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. I 'd, you know, like to get your thoughts about the possible veto of that bill. But on the hand, this is a weekend where the embassy, U.S. embassy, in Vietnam is opening up. So it 's almost, you know, past and present. Your thoughts on this? FRED BARNES : Well, it 's remarkable the way things can change, particularly on Vietnam. I would have thought that the whole recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being opposed to the war in Vietnam and, at least, avoiding the draft - it would have much more controversial than it 's turned out to be. And yet, while I have my qualms about it, the president has John McCain, a POW in Vietnam, and Bob Kerrey of Kansas sic - Nebraska, the senator who won a Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and they 're both very, very strongly in favor of this. And it 's gone down very, very well for the president. I still think there 's some grumbling but-. And then on the embargo, you know, it passed the House again ; it had passed the Senate by enough to override the president 's veto, and it passed the House by way more than enough to override the president 's veto. So, it 's going to come down to whether a couple of Democratic senators will switch their vote and now join the president. LIANE HANSEN : What do you think it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift the arms embargo - our relationship with the U.N., our relationship with NATO, and the escalating war in that part of the world? FRED BARNES : Well, it 's going to mean that we 're going to have a different relationship with Britain and France there. It does n't mean that the embargo 's going to be lifted overnight. You know, there are so many qualifications and waivers and things that have to happen in 12 weeks for this, and then- so, it wo n't happen overnight. But it would really express the position of the American government over the objections of the president that the U.S. has given up on the U.N. ' s role in Bosnia, and that something else will have to be done, probably by NATO. LIANE HANSEN : If the president is performing, in your estimation, well enough to actually look like he might be reelected, what about Whitewater? We have double-header hearings scheduled this coming week in the House and the Senate. FRED BARNES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the Waco hearings and Whitewater hearings this summer that the president would be taking a double-whammy. And yet, the Waco hearings have really turned out the way- concluding what we knew anyway, that David Koresh was a very bad human being, and the FBI and the other agents could have handled it better. We knew that already, and that 's what the hearings said. Whitewater is a little more touchy, but it has not aroused the sort of national passion that other scandals involving White Houses have. LIANE HANSEN : And Waco - the case is closed, we 've heard the testimony, and can we put this incident behind us? FRED BARNES : I think so. I think that 's absolutely what the hearings did. LIANE HANSEN : Other hearings, ones that will not be public, more private, those allegations of sexual misconduct against Sen. Bob Packwood. The Senate voted last week not to hold public hearings on these allegations. I do n't know - I guess my reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again. I 'd like to hear yours. FRED BARNES : Well, there are a lot of boys up there - about 97 of them, or 94, or whatever the number is. You know, I think this is really just sort of a power question. Now, I know, Liane, you 're going to say I 'm just being cynical and so on, but if Republicans are in charge, they do n't want a public hearing on the problems of their guy, because what will happen, of course, if there 's a public hearing and it 's on television and there 's testimony against Sen. Packwood, that means they 're going to have to assign a tougher penalty to him. I think they 're already going to have to, with these new charges that have come out, and prolonging the hearing, and the case- Barbara Boxer, the senator from California has kept the case on television day after day after day. But if Democrats- I 'm convinced that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, they 'd vote against public hearings in that case. LIANE HANSEN : Anything else been on your mind lately? Me, I 've been paying attention to baseball. FRED BARNES : Well, so have I. A great pennant race in the East - if you 're a Red Sox fan, you can hardly believe that here it is, heading into mid-August, and the Red Sox are still four-and-a-half games ahead. I 'm sure it 's an illusion. LIANE HANSEN : Well, we 're count our blessings, because baseball is indeed on the radio this summer, so we have it to listen to. Fred Barnes is the executive editor of The Standard magazine, which premiers in September. He 's also a regular commentator for Weekend Edition. Thanks a lot, Fred. FRED BARNES : I enjoyed it, Liane. Glad you 're back..
