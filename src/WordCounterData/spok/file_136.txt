246741 @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos : You know, one of our favorite guests around here is Sarah Jessica Parker. She 's a Golden Globe and Emmy Award winning actress, and now she 's about to add something else to her formidable resume. The role of Carrie Bradshaw on the hit TV show " Sex and the City " made Parker not only a cultural phenomenon but a fashion icon, as well. Many tuned in week after week to see what Carrie would wear next. qwq @( Clip-from- " Sex-and @!LAUER : So guess what? Parker has used her fashion expertise to create her very own line. It 's called Bitten, and the really good news -- and I mean this -- you do not have to be a TV star or a movie star to afford this stuff. Sarah Jessica Parker, good morning. How are you? @!Ms-SARAH-JESSICA-P : Good morning, Matt. I 'm well, thanks. @!LAUER : You look great. @!Ms-PARKER : Thank you. @!LAUER : And I want to talk about this clothing line in a second, but first, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after " Sex and the City " there may finally be some momentum on a movie. @!Ms-PARKER : I think momentum is the word to focus on rather than there is going to be a movie. I think -- I think the best thing to say is I 'm hopeful, I feel more hopeful this time, but there still remains so much stuff, simple, logistical things to be -- to be done and hammered out. @!LAUER : Has someone approached you about this? Have you shot scenes for this already? @!Ms-PARKER : Or this is all a figment of my imagine -- I 'm making a movie in my head. @!LAUER : But, I mean... @!Ms-PARKER : No, there is some true, real discussions, and it 's just, you know, complex, but hope -- I 'm hopeful, I 'm hopeful, I 'm hopeful. @!LAUER : The movie business, complex. All right, let 's talk about the fashion line. @!Ms-PARKER : All right. @!LAUER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name? @!Ms-PARKER : Well, when you work in the theater as a young person and you have a good experience and you want to keep pursuing a career in the theater, they say you got -- you got bitten by the bug... @!LAUER : Right. @!Ms-PARKER :... theater bug. And so when I first heard about Steve &amp; Barry I was really sort of dubious and actually quite skeptical that this could be done at this price point and that all the labor practices were above board. And so I just did due diligence and I started learning about this company, and I was really so seduced and so enchanted by what they want to do for women, what they 've already done for young men. I got bitten. @!LAUER : But the price point, let 's talk about that, and we mentioned it outside a second ago. Every piece in this line comes in under $20. @!Ms-PARKER : That 's right. @!LAUER : And Carrie Bradshaw character, not known for being frugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, this is really kind of a change of course. What did you want to accomplish? @!Ms-PARKER : Well, it 's not a change of course from my life in certain ways. I mean, I grew up with not a whole lot of access to things that were costly. I come from a family where my mother had to be very intrepid and industrious about things. @!LAUER : Right. @!Ms-PARKER : So I 'm very -- I 'm keenly aware of things not being accessible to people, especially to women and especially when it comes to fashion. So what I really -- what appealed to me about this is the idea of making fashion accessible to all women in this country despite their economic status, their age, their size, their ethnic background, their shape, their anything. And I think it 's sort of this democratization of fashion that I really love. @!LAUER : Let 's give people an idea of what we 're gabbing about here, OK? @!Ms-PARKER : OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now... @!Ms-PARKER : Yes. @!LAUER :... is Dawn. @!Ms-PARKER : Yes. @!LAUER : And what Dawn is coming out in, the entire outfit from head to toe under $59. @!Ms-PARKER : That 's exactly right. It 's a three-quartered sleeve linen jacket with a simple linen trouser with a, you know, flap pocket, and one of my favorite totes. The jacket is $19.98. The pants, the trousers, I think are about 19.98, maybe 14.98, and the bag is 9.98. And the shoes are 9.98, as well. @!TEXT : Bitten - Blazer $19.98 - Linen Pant $14.98 - Tank $7.98 - Tote $9.98 - Bangle $5.98 - Total = $58.90 @!LAUER : It 's beautiful. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah, it 's very simple. @!LAUER : And, now, did you design this yourself? @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah. Yeah. @!LAUER : Did you draw this and the whole thing? @!Ms-PARKER : Well, I 'm not a sketcher... @!LAUER : Right. @!Ms-PARKER :... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two people on my team, Irene, who is, and Mikhail who has -- they both have great fashion pedigrees, so they help me interpret. @!LAUER : All right. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah. @!LAUER : Dawn, thank you very much. Appreciate it. @!Ms-PARKER : Thanks, Dawn. Thanks. You look great. @!LAUER : Next we have Sonya... @!Ms-PARKER : Sonya, darling Sonya. @!LAUER :... and she 's wearing -- what do we call it, a tank dress? @!Ms-PARKER : This is two -- we 've layered two tank dresses. Fourteen ninety-eight these tank dresses are. The one underneath is a sort of slate gray and this is our teal. And she 's wearing a little kind of Mao-collared top, which is 7.98, I think. And the two dresses, each are, I think, $14.98? @!TEXT : Bitten - Top $7.98 - 2 Tank Dress @ $14.98 Ea. - Shoes $9.98 - Total : $47.92 @!LAUER : That 's all right. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you, but we 've got the graphics up there on the screen. @!Ms-PARKER : And the shoes are not -- are just under $10. And this dress is one of my favorite, favorite dresses because it 's really simple and it looks good on everybody. And we have it in four colors and it 's just very charming and simple and perfect for the summer. @!LAUER : Sonya, thank you very much. You look great. @!Ms-PARKER : And Sonya looks darling in it, of course. @!LAUER : Tatiana is next, and I understand she 's wearing one of your favorite items in the line. @!Ms-PARKER : Love it. @!LAUER : This is a fleece hoodie. @!Ms-PARKER : This is a double-zip fleece hoodie and it 's $19.98. And she 's got our cuffed jean, our special jean, just for the summer. It 's a cuff jean. Also 19.98. Fourteen ninety-eight? Matt, help me out. @!LAUER : We 'll put the graphics up here. @!Ms-PARKER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... @!Ms-PARKER : Fourteen ninety-eight for the jeans. @!LAUER :... for the capri pants, the hoodie is 14.98... @!Ms-PARKER : Fourteen ninety-eight. @!LAUER :... the top 's 7.98, flip flops 9.98. @!Ms-PARKER : And our earrings -- yeah. @!TEXT : Bitten - Capri Pants $14.98 - Hoodie $14.98 - Top $7.98 - Flip Flops $9.98 - Earrings $5.98 - Total : $59.88 @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah, so it 's a relatively inexpensive outfit.

And the jeans, I 'm really proud of our fit on our jeans because we worked hard on that. @!LAUER : Tatiana, thanks very much. Appreciate it. @!Ms-PARKER : Thanks, Tatiana. @!LAUER : Next is Susan, who 's wearing a shirt dress. Hi, Susan. How are you? @!SUSAN : Hi. @!Ms-PARKER : Shirt dress. Classic, simple, silhouette.

Our great wedge... @!LAUER : Nine ninety-eight, as well. @!Ms-PARKER :... which I think is 9.98, as well. Yeah, with a sort of little nice detail of a more sparkly little piping around the toe and... @!LAUER : So the whole outfit here, $39 and 94 cents. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah. @!LAUER : And, Susan, I 'm not ogling the models here, but come closer, seriously. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah, yeah. @!LAUER : Because, you know, people talk about -- they say you get what you pay for. @!Ms-PARKER : Yeah. @!LAUER : So how 's the quality going to hold up on this? @!Ms-PARKER : Well, we -- you know, so far we feel really good about production. I mean, it remains to be seen. Obviously we think it 's going to wear really well. We 've worked really, really, really hard so that people do n't say that very thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this, and it 's actually some of the same people that make the higher-end stuff that just charge an exorbitant price. @!LAUER : All right. @!Ms-PARKER : So... @!LAUER : All right, Susan, thank you, before I get accused of ogling the models, go ahead. @!Ms-PARKER : Thanks, Susan. @!LAUER : Next we have Meghan, and she 's wearing -- now this is one of the more expensive outfits in the entire line.
