235941 NOAH ADAMS, Host : One eigth-graders lesson on the Holocaust - how much did he learn. That story coming up on All Things Considered. music ROBERT SIEGEL, Host : This is All Things Considered. I 'm Robert Siegel. NOAH ADAMS, Host : And I 'm Noah Adams. Last week, we heard the story of some Chicago eight-graders and their class trip to Washington, D.C. We return today to that subject to tell this anecdote. It 's the story of one student, who started quite a stir when he declared in class two months ago that he did not believe that the Holocaust occurred. As part of series on Washington Irving Elementary School, NPR 's Ira Glass reports on how this debate about history played out when the class paid its visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. IRA GLASS, Reporter : Abraham Palasios is one of the most articulate eight-grade boys and canny people-watcher, and so it 's no surprise that at first, he did n't tell his teacher, Joe Perlstein, what he thought of the Holocaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be emotional lectures, there 'd be long, heart-felt talks, one-on-one. But one day back in April, when Mr. P was out, students were doing group work with a substitute teacher, and finally, he told an adult what he 'd been telling his friends. ABRAHAM PALASIOS, Student, Washington Irving Elem. : Everyone tells me that the Holocaust is real and this and that. I do n't believe it. Even though I see books, I do n't believe it, ' cause I was n't alive, and people just tell stories like I told you - people make up stories. Maybe, I think, they made up that story just to protect the Jews. That 's what I think. IRA GLASS : Abraham says he did n't pick up his skepticism about the Holocaust at home, or by listening to talk radio, or really, from any adults. It all just sounded too incredible to him. Why had he never heard of it before Mr. Perlstein 's class? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true, but I think he added it, because he 's a Jew, he feels proud of what- you know, of, wow, thinks unintelligible to the Jews. I mean- 1st STUDENT : Mr. P is going to kill you when he sees it. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : He can kill me all he wants. IRA GLASS : It got pretty raucous. Madie went to the shelf and came back with a copy of The Diary of Anne Frank, and waved it at Abraham, asking if he thought that all the personal experiences in it were made up. He reached for the nearest book to wave back. It was - no kidding - The Beavis and Butthead Ensucklopedia. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : This is a book. Look at this - this is stories, is n't it? And look at this - is this real? IRA GLASS : Books are n't reality, he said. Then, one of the boys who was repeating eight grade spoke up - Israel Tapea sp. Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington, D.C. ISRAEL TAPEA, Student, Washington Irving Elem. : From my point of view, I do believe in the Holocaust, because I 've been- shouting over other students I 've been- I 've been- I 've been- I 've been to the Holocaust Museum, and I 've seen all those people, and I seen the diary, and it 's paper. She had a picture and everything, and she was right there, and she was a lady. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : I could take a picture with me bloody and everything, and I could take a picture from- ISRAEL TAPEA : But she was not bloody or nothing. It was a picture like Normez or Jeffrey or you. IRA GLASS : In general, Abraham seems to take a kind of perverse pleasure in holding a contrary opinion, being at the center of an argument. But this is true for lots of teenagers. Sometimes, they hold certain prejudices and unpopular points of view just because they get people 's goat, draw some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham to take a stand like this, most teachers were compelled to respond. And, in front of the whole class, Mr. Perlstein treated the subject with the utmost seriousness. JOE PERLSTEIN, Teacher, Washington Irving Elem. : There are some people today who still say the Holocaust did not exist. Number one, the Holocaust is not a Jewish thing. The Holocaust is a man 's inhumanity toward men thing. It belongs to all of us. IRA GLASS : Mr. Perlstein had his students read the Pulitzer Prize-winning comic book novel Mouse. He showed them a video with Opera Winfrey interviewing concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel, with grisly footage of the camps, the ovens, stacks of bodies. But at the end of all this, when students wrote their essays, Abraham wrote, ' I still think this is not real. Maybe a little bit - who knows? Maybe I will believe this whole story, ' he put the word story in quotes, ' when I go to Washington. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Abraham had been so public about his beliefs that he was understandably self-conscious as we walked into the Holocaust Museum. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Why is everyone looking at me? 2nd STUDENT : You just bumped into me. IRA GLASS : We went to a section of the museum especially set up for children, and Abraham wandered away from the group. This portion of the museum tells the story of one boy who was sent to the concentration camps and his family, and of all of our stops in Washington, it was one of the most engaging and popular with the students. Generally, these students shrug off anything that happened before they were born as irrelevant. But Veronica Gallardo sp said that the boy 's story had a much different effect on her than the videos and readings they 'd done in class. VERONICA GALLARDO, Student, Washington Irving Elem. : Because I really did n't, you know, I did n't really care, because it was in the past already, you know. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, he was said because his parents and stuff, you know, I really, like, felt for him, because he talked about his life. That 's it. IRA GLASS : I caught up with Abraham on the bus, after the museum, and even he said he was moved. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : It made me believe that the Holocaust was real and that, I mean, I was crying because I felt as if it were my own race and all that, you know, like it happened to my people, too. IRA GLASS : You were crying? ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Yeah. I do n't why - it just got to me. IRA GLASS : What makes someone change their mind about anything? When I pressed Abraham on what precisely had done the trick for him, he said the museum had n't given factual proof about the Holocaust 's actual existence, but the story got to him, and besides, things had been building up over time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders that happened in Mexico that made the idea of the Holocaust more believable. And on top of all that, he felt that he had no choice but to say he believed, what with all his classmates and teachers always on his case about it. interviewing Is it partly that you 're partly convinced, and partly because you 're sick of everybody asking you? ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Yeah. Yes, I do. See, she asked me. Jennifer, everyone, asking me, so I guess I believe in it now. IRA GLASS : Just to get everybody off your back? ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Part of it, and part of it is because, like I said, it can happen to anyone. IRA GLASS : In the end, it 's unclear what Abraham really believes about the Holocaust and what he only says he believes. When I asked him exactly where in the exhibit he cried, he got vague, never answered, and it seemed possible he had n't cried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson Memorial, and there his friends Jennifer, Patty, and Naomi gave a very different spin on the whole thing. They said Abraham was exaggerating all his feelings. 3rd STUDENT : Like I say, he want 's to get people 's attention. That 's why he 's saying that he does n't believe in it, because he 's the only one that- 4th STUDENT : He wants to be the center of attention, that 's all. IRA GLASS : Right. But now that he 's saying, ' OK, I- ' 3rd STUDENT : I think he 's faking it. I think he 's just- IRA GLASS : You think he 's faking which part of it - faking saying he does n't believe, or faking saying now he does? 3rd STUDENT : Faking now, saying that he does believe in it. IRA GLASS : Really? 3rd STUDENT : That 's what I think. IRA GLASS : You think that 's the part he 's faking? 3rd STUDENT : I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so he 'll say anything. IRA GLASS : Seeing them talking to me, Abraham came over and tried to bust it up. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Hey, OK, hold on, see, this was my story, so I should hear it. I just want to hear - I wo n't say anything. 3rd STUDENT : No, you got ta get out. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : No, this is my story. He told me, because- this is my story. IRA GLASS : And standing there in front of the 19-foot statute of Thomas Jefferson, the 14 year-olds engaged in a heated debate over what Abraham believes. As Abraham 's teacher, Mr. Perlstein, says, only Abraham knows the answer to that. All a teacher could do is repeat the lesson over and over, give students many reasons to believe and understand, and if they want to believe it, fine. And as for Abraham, he told me later that his big fear that some day, years from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elementary school friends remember about him. ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Like 20 years from now, ' Oh, remember this guy. ' It 's always going to be- ca n't take that away. 5th STUDENT : You still believe in that story? Are you sure, man? ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Yes, I 'm sure. I 'm going to put a sign on my back that says, ' Everyone shut up and stop asking me. ' That 's what I 'm going to do. 5th STUDENT : Wait, how did you change your mind? What got you to change your mind? ABRAHAM PALASIOS : Well, when it comes out on the radio, you 'll hear it. I 'm tired of explaining myself over and over. IRA GLASS : If you run into him, do n't bring it up. He does n't want to talk about it anymore. I 'm Ira Glass reporting..
