237041 ANNOUNCER : From Washington, Crossfire. On the left, Mike Kinsley. On the right, Pat Buchanan. Tonight : Sex, Lies and Sportsmanship. In the crossfire, Claire Walsh of the Sexual Assault Recovery Service. And Mel Feit of the National Center for Men. PAT BUCHANAN : Good evening and welcome to Crossfire. After its best record in years, the Washington Caps hockey team faces a post-season disaster. A grand jury is investigating a charge that four players raped the 17 year old girlfriend of a fifth in the back of a limousine after a party of boozing. According to the girl, she was forced into sex acts by three teammates while a fourth watched. According to the driver of the limo, however, the girl got into the car voluntarily and was a willing participant. This scandal has stunned this city and questions arise. How common has gang rape become? Are the girls involved not in some part at least to blame for putting themselves into these situations and has the general cheapening of the idea of sex led many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal. ' Michael? MIKE KINSLEY : Mr. Feit, why would she make it up? MEL FEIT, National Center for Men : Oh, women do n't make up false accusations of rape, of course. Every time a woman says she was raped, she was raped. That 's nonsense @!KINSLEY No, I 'm asking- I 'm not asking you about every time. I 'm asking you about this occasion. Mr. FEIT : I do n't know- KINSLEY : Why would she make it up? Mr. FEIT : -whether this claim is a false claim. What I can tell you is this. That the women who runs the sex crimes unit in New York City where I live says that of the nearly 4000 reported rapes every year in Manhattan, about 2000 are false. That means that half of the time when a woman says, ' He raped me, ' she 's trying to rape him. She 's trying to send an innocent man to jail for 10 or 15 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you spend your life thinking about these things apparently. Do n't you ever wonder why would they do that? Give me a theory. Why would she make- Mr. FEIT : I 'll give you a scenario about- KINSLEY : No, take this scenario. Mr. FEIT : I do n't know whether this is a false case. And we do n't know whether there was an actual rape- KINSLEY : Well, we understand we do n't know the facts here. Mr. FEIT : Yes @!KINSLEY So, but take the facts as we know them and explain to me why this girl would make it up. Mr. FEIT : Because in some instances, not all instances, but in some instances a woman has sex with a man or men and feels tremendously guilty about it afterwards. And the only way that some women can cope with that guilt is that they tell themselves, it was n't their fault, they were coerced into it, they got drunk, they were forced to do it. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, well, did they use physical force? The woman says, yeah, they did and in her mind, in her mind, she really believes she was raped when maybe she was n't really @!BUCHANAN All right. Claire, let me ask you this. We ca n't make a judgment as to whether it was criminal conduct. We 're not- certainly it 's squalid behavior by these individuals. And there was one Capital player who apparently opened the door and found a struggle of some kind going on. So, I 'm not going to defend the conduct of these guys, whether it was just squalid or criminal or not. But is n't there a real problem here with a lot of these women who are basically groupies and run around sleeping with a lot of these ball players and stuff. And they get themselves in these drunken parties and something happens and then they cry rape. I mean, are n't they at least in some part responsible for putting themselves into this situation? CLAIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have to look at the reality of the situation. And before I answer that question I just want to make a statement to Mel that- and I find the statistics that you have presented here tonight fallacious and outrageous because, in fact, if that were the case, the FBI certainly would have recounted that. And according to FBI statistics, only 2 percent of rapes are in fact- Mr. FEIT : I cited a source. Ms. WALSH : That doesn't- Mr. FEIT : I cited a source. Ms. WALSH : That does n't mean- Mr. FEIT : And I 'll cite another source. The United States Air Force says that up to two-thirds of rape claims are false- KINSLEY : Let- let her finish. Ms. WALSH : That also is a very obscure study. I certainly would go with the FBI statistics @!KINSLEY Well, look, these statistics are not- BUCHANAN : All right. To refine- KINSLEY : These statistics are not incompatible. You say, some women falsely accuse men of rape. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, those are not in conflict in any way. Surely, you would agree that many, many, many rapes go unreported. Mr. FEIT : Yeah. What I am concerned about now is what happens to those women, those 2000 women in New York every year who make a false accusation. What happens to them? Are they sent to prison? Are they brought before a judge? You know, the only cases- KINSLEY : Well, what happens to the thousands and thousands of men who commit a rape and who never get charged- Mr. FEIT : We must- KINSLEY : Which is a worse crime? Falsely accusing someone of rape or raping someone? Mr. FEIT : They 're equal- equally heinous crimes @!KINSLEY You 've got to be kidding. Mr. FEIT : No. A person- KINSLEY : You 've got to be kidding. Mr. FEIT : No. If someone falsely accused you of a crime that threatened your life and you would spend 20 years of your life in jail for a crime you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would think that would- Mr. FEIT : I think a false accusation is a moral equivalent of attempted murder @!BUCHANAN All right. Let me bring Claire into this. Now, look, if these guys, and they were behind there- this place in Georgetown. Now, if some coed, 17-year-old coed was walking along the street and they grabbed her and dragged her into that limousine, I think everybody in Washington would say, put four of them in jail maybe for life for that. It 's a vicious rape. However, this town is reserving judgment, I think, partly because they do n't know for sure. Now, again, can we get back to the question. Is n't the girl somewhat culpable for having put herself in this limousine. Some say she gets into this car voluntarily near 2 o'clock in the morning. Ms. WALSH : I think that we have to be careful on commenting specifically on this case. However, what I would like to make very clear is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And indeed sometimes individuals do participate in poor judgment. For instance, drinking with somebody that they may not know, for instance, you know, many of the things that you- BUCHANAN : All right. Ms. WALSH : -you have already recounted here. However, I think what we need to do, Pat, is we have to look at the culpability and place it exactly where it is- BUCHANAN : I agree. Ms. WALSH : -and that is with the- BUCHANAN : Let me ask you- Ms. WALSH : -offenders who have transgressed- BUCHANAN : If they used force, I agree with you. But is there not a difference between, let 's say, taking- the coed walking down the street and being dragged into the car and some girl who-let 's put it bluntly-who may have behaved as a total tramp for a long period of time and all of sudden they drag her in the car and treat her like a tramp. Is n't there a difference in the kind of punishment you would impose upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did come to a point where she started to resist and they used some force. Ms. WALSH : I think what you 're trying to do is set up a dual system of judgment and of justice in which there are some people that we will call this rape and take it to its nth degree. Now, others- BUCHANAN : I guess, I'm- Ms. WALSH : -but she is- BUCHANAN : If it 's worse- Ms. WALSH : -more culpable because she is more sexually active or whatever- BUCHANAN : I am setting up- now, I agree with you. Wait a minute. If you use force there 's no doubt what it is, it 's rape. However, is n't there mitigating circumstances if you had someone who has been- behaved, say, like a groupie and a tramp around all of them and one of them suddenly takes advantage of her at a time when she does n't want to be taken advantage of. There 's a difference between that, surely, and grabbing some innocent kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One- one would result in a life sentence, I think, and the other is going to be mitigating punishment, would it not? Ms. WALSH : There is a difference between what you 're suggesting and consensual sex. There is a big difference and that is the choice. Now, an individual- one of the things that we 're seeing across the country is a set-up situation occurring. And the situation is that a woman will agree to have sex with one man and after that- that episode has happened, the man will leave the bedroom and then others will enter. So, it is a set-up. Now, it appears collusive because the woman is having sex with someone. We are still in a society- Mr. FEIT : That- Ms. WALSH : -which demands chastity of its women. And yet we expect that our males who will be- Mr. FEIT : Feminists would have us- Ms. WALSH : So, there is a double standard. Mr. FEIT : Feminists would have us believe that a woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way through intercourse. And at any point even during the middle of the act, if he persists it 's rape. I think we have- I think Pat is right, there have to be gradations here. But I do n't know- no, I do n't agree with you that a woman is ever culpable, that she ever brings it on herself and that we can say that rape is justified @!BUCHANAN I did n't say that. Mr. FEIT : Well, I do n't think we can ever- we have to be careful never to blame a woman because I do n't she 's ever- BUCHANAN : Well, I say, when it 's force, the guy uses force- KINSLEY : Well, explain to me what you mean when you say that if the woman- you seem to be saying that there 's some point if a woman says no, a man has the right to ignore that and that 's not rape. Mr. FEIT : No, I do n't think so. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEIT : What I 'm saying is that I think women are culpable, too, about the way in which they treat men. And what happens frequently is that women misuse their sexual power, abuse their sexual power. I 'll give you an example. There was a study done at Texas A&amp;M University where 40 percent of the women who were surveyed said they sometimes said no to sex when they really meant to say yes because, some of them admitted, they liked to make men beg for it. I think - KINSLEY : Is that as bad as rape? Mr. FEIT : I think that women- women are sometimes motivated to make men feel humiliated and powerless and that 's exactly the rapist 's motivation. And yeah, the objectives are exactly the same @!KINSLEY Okay. Well, when we come back we 'll be joined by a woman sportswriter from the Washington Post who 's covered the Caps and maybe can shed some light on this for us. Commercial break KINSLEY : Welcome back to Crossfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control. It 's the story of a 17-year-old girl who claims that she was gang raped in the back of a limousine by four members of the Washington Capitals hockey team. Rape is a common occurrence unfortunately. But false accusations of rape are also not unknown. We 're discussing that dilemma with Claire Walsh who 's director of the Sexual Assault Recovery Service at the University of Florida. And with Mel Feit who is executive director of something called the National Center for Men. And we 're joined now by Christine Brennan, a sportswriter for the Washington Post and president of the Association for Women in Sports Media. Christine, these guys have not yet even been charged and of course you ca n't pronounce anymore than the rest of us can about their guilt or innocence of this accusation. But you can shed some light. You 've covered the Capitals. You know the world of sports. Does this kind of thing happen? CHRISTINE BRENNAN, ' Washington Post ' Sportswriter : Well, I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover sports and not crime beat. Certainly things have happened in the past involving professional athletes, whether it be drug rehab or contract negotiations or drug arrests. So, these things are continuing. And I think - I 'm not so certain that it 's new. Babe Ruth was notorious for running around trains and doing all sorts of things back when he was playing. But I think the difference is now that the news media is much, much more investigative and we are going to check on these things. We are not going to let them pass the way they may have passed in the good old days back in the 20 's, 30 's, 40 's and 50 's @!KINSLEY Now, too, just to be fair to the opposite point of view. Is it also common, or not common, that there are groupies, willing women who will go along with anything and- and might have led these guys on? I mean, is that also true? Ms. BRENNAN : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they- what they 're doing in the hotel lobbies. But, sure, there are groupies. And there are- you know, in addition to female groupies, there are male groupies. I have seen hundreds of people camped in Washington Redskin or Washington Capitals lobbies, hotel lobbies, waiting for players to come out and get autographs. So, men and women both. Sports obviously does encourage groupies to form and this is a case where I 'm sure that there are groupies involved with the Capitals @!BUCHANAN All right. Christine, without naming one of them, I believe it was your newspaper mentioned it, one of these individuals who's- allegedly was involved with a 17-year-old left the limousine, then went out to Prince George 's county where the 17-year-old girlfriend was staying with another player and she woke up to find him in bed with her. Do you know these- what are these guys like that are involved in this? Ms. BRENNAN : I know all four of the Capitals that are involved with this incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is that I 've found the Washington Capitals to be the easiest locker room to work in this town. It 's much more- the players are much friendlier and nicer, much better to deal with with the media than, say, the Redskins or some other teams around town @!BUCHANAN You mean these are the sweet ones? Ms. BRENNAN : I do n't know if I 'd use the word sweet. But it is an irony. The hockey players who are these bears on the ice tend to be some of the nicest people to deal with @!BUCHANAN All right. Let me ask you- well, nice people do n't rape 17-year-old girls, excuse me. And do you think that the kind of conduct that 's been alleged against them, does that strike you as utterly and totally inconsistent with the characters whom you worked with even if they were, say, all liquored up after a big post-season party? Ms. BRENNAN : I- I can not say if it is totally inconsistent with what I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I only know them in a work sense. And that 's the important thing to keep in mind about all sportswriters. We do n't socialize with these people. We cover them @!KINSLEY Go ahead. Mr. FEIT : Well, first of all, I want to say something. Washington is probably an enlightened town, more than New York, because we have a similar case in New York where young athletes on the St. John 's University lacrosse team were accused of gang sexual assault and no one uses the word alleged there. The- St. John 's University has suspended these students without a hearing and that 's happened in many other instances where I know of. It happened to Dan Quayle 's aide, a man accused of a sex crime is often punished without an evidentiary hearing, without having an opportunity to give his side of the story. There is a process due any person accused of a crime including men accused of- BUCHANAN : Well, wait a minute now. Excuse me. But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university- if six guys are involved in sexual relations with a coed, they can boot them out of school without- Mr. FEIT : That 's the same thing. It 's an alleged, there is an alleged- KINSLEY : Surely, surely, Mel- BUCHANAN : I mean, they all denied- nothing took place at all? Mr. FEIT : Yes. No. The men have denied- BUCHANAN : What did they say? Mr. FEIT : They said that there was willing sex. The woman involved- BUCHANAN : Okay. Well, the school- it 's a Catholic university. They can punish six guys and they- Mr. FEIT : Without a hearing? BUCHANAN : This is not a criminal proceeding. Mr. FEIT : They were suspended because the university- KINSLEY : Mel- Mr. FEIT : -believed the accusation that it was forced sex without even conducting some kind of a formal hearing. There was no due process. What about Dan Quayle 's aide who lost his job because a woman at Baylor accused him of rape. There- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think, look, when a man 's in a public official position very often when you 're charged or something is alleged, you take a leave of absence quite naturally. That doesn't- that 's not to say the guy 's guilty of a crime @!KINSLEY Mel, before you can be convicted of a crime in this country, he would have to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and thank God for it. That 's the American system. Mr. FEIT : Unless you 're a man accused of- KINSLEY : However- however, would you wait a minute? However, when the reason is ' cause you go to jail. When there are other questions like holding on to your job or staying as a student in a school, the standard of evidence is quite reasonably lower, is n't that reasonable? Mr. FEIT : Yes. But is an accusation proof of guilt? Is that what you 're willing to accept? Because that 's what happened at St. John 's. That 's what happened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute. Hold it, Mel. Look- look, these- well, look, none of these guys- if these four Capitals came and said, look, we were n't in any limousine and I never saw that girl, I would agree with you 100 percent. Mr. FEIT : And that 's what- BUCHANAN : But they 're not going to- Mr. FEIT : That 's what Dan Quayle 's aide did. He denied the allegations. The young men at St. John 's have denied the allegations. Why are they punished- Ms. WALSH : I think - Mr. FEIT : -without at hearing? KINSLEY : Go ahead. Ms. WALSH : I think that we have to recognize that in every single case an offender will deny an accusation. And, in fact, we know from research that males do not process the- do not call the act that they have committed rape. They call it something else @!BUCHANAN Let me- Ms. WALSH : And in every single case a willing victim is always- is always- BUCHANAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old, is reportedly the girlfriend of another Capitals player, Steve what's-his-name. Have you, as a journalist, followed up and called Steve or talked to the other players? Because it seems to me that the situation- the morale on this team and its relation with this city has been so torn up that we 're going to see some dramatic changes, are we not, in the make up of the- the Capitals team when they go on the ice next year? Ms. BRENNAN : That 's a larger issue, I think, Pat. That 's important to bring up. That forever, I think, the reputation of these four players has been changed and altered. They were role models. There were kids wearing jerseys with their names on the back, 10-, 11-year old kids. Whether they should be role models is another issue. But they are and they have a huge impact on kids. And that has been changed. And that is a shame because they can never, ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine. Let me ask you this because I 'm asking for your judgment. Let 's set aside whether they 're guilty of criminal conduct and let 's say they 're not even as alleged, given the behavior that was written up in your publication and in the Washington Times, can they serve as role models and do you think the team would be better off if they went to another city now? Ms. BRENNAN : I think it would difficult for them to serve as role models, certainly the way they were before. It 's all changed. Probably these are decisions that David Poilsp? who 's a fine man and general manager of the Washington Capitals will make. But my guess would be that something would have to change in the situation they have now because I have trouble picturing them on the ice in Washington Capitals jerseys come this fall @!BUCHANAN Okay. We 'll be back with more on the scandal with the Washington Caps. Commercial break BUCHANAN : Claire, I 'm not going to condone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an awful lot of forced sex and gang rape and fraternity-style rape that goes on much more so than the 50 's. Is n't it in a sense- are n't women partly, in a sense, responsible for creating the climate in which it exists by the very cheapening of sex? You know, we 're supposed to teach little kids in fourth grade how to use condoms and all this nonsense. The very idea that it 's sort of- nobody takes it very seriously anymore. It 's quote, ' No big deal. ' Ms. WALSH : Well, I think that that's- that 's the belief that it 's no big deal and that 's the way most people feel. But that 's not what I hear working in my college campus and working with other- other campuses across the country. I think that what we need to do is we need to de-sexualize a crime. What we 're looking at is we 're looking at a pseudosexual screen which totally belies the incident of what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is involved in- KINSLEY : Mel, let me ask Mel a question because we 're running out of time here. Let 's leave rape out of it for a second. Suppose this girl consented. Does- so, what you 've got is three guys drunk, two of them married with children gang-banging a consenting drunken 17-year-old. Now, as the head of the national executive- whatever it is, for men- Mr. FEIT : I 'm not- KINSLEY : Does that strike you as a good thing for men to be doing? Mr. FEIT : No. But when a woman is drunk somehow we say that she 's not responsible for her behavior. In fact, we make men responsible for her behavior @!KINSLEY I 'm asking you- you run an organization for men. Do you want to stand up and say that these men were behaving well? Mr. FEIT : No. I want to make it clear that anyone who would poison an act of lovemaking with brutality wo n't have any friends in my organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women together create a cycle of violence whereby women abuse men who abuse women who abuse men. And the only way to stop that is for both sexes to acknowledge their culpability @!KINSLEY You'd- Ms. WALSH : One of the things that I would like to interject and we do have a meeting of the minds of a way here, Mel. And that is that women have been trying for years to deal with this horrendous social problem that we have and we all suffer because of it. Because you 've got women in your family, you 've got women in your life. We all have people who are going to be very traumatized by this. We can not do this by ourselves. Men have to become involved in the struggle to end this kind of violence- Mr. FEIT : And women have to be taught that they 're responsible @!BUCHANAN Let 's give the last word to the Washington Post. Christine? Ms. BRENNAN : Well, I think it 's great to have women involved in news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation perhaps to sensitize all of us. The reason we should have women sportswriters, black sportswriters, Asians, Hispanic is because the pluralism helps. And it makes us all more aware and more sensitive to others ' needs. So, I think that that probably has helped in having women in the business, I 'm sure, has helped to cover some of these issues that we were n't dealing with 15, 20, 30 years ago @!KINSLEY Okay. Thanks very much, Christine. Ms. BRENNAN : Thank you @!KINSLEY Thank you, Mel Feit. Thank you, Claire Walsh. Pat Buchanan and I will be back in a moment. Commercial break BUCHANAN : Tomorrow night on Capital Gang : verdict in Bensonhurst, the Pan Am 103 report is out, and who is the real George Bush. That 's 7:00 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN. You know, Michael, oddly this thing corresponds almost exactly to the famous Scottsboro case where the black kids allegedly raped those two women, remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on the side of the males. Well, where 's the liberals today? KINSLEY : There are injustices in the world. Pat, I hope you were n't implying earlier on that it 's something less than rape if a woman happens to be drunk or if she wants to sleep with one guy and finds herself sleeping with four or five @!BUCHANAN Well, if it 's force, there 's no question it 's rape. But there are mitigating circumstances @!KINSLEY From the left, I 'm Mike Kinsley. Good night for Crossfire @!BUCHANAN From the right, Pat Buchanan. Join us Monday night for another edition of Crossfire.
