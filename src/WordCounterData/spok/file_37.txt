225141 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : Segment One this morning, kids and guns. While lawmakers rush to pass anti-crime legislation, the tragedy escalates every day. Yesterday a dozen youngsters brought their plea for peace to Capitol Hill telling Congress how guns and violence have affected their lives. Two of these young people join us this morning -- Rushon Harrison and Zoe Johnstone. Also joining us this morning is New York Congressman Charles Schumer who chairs the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice. Good morning to all of you. Thank you very much for being with us. Rushon, yesterday you very poignantly talked about how gunfire had impacted on your life. How many of your friends have been murdered? @!RUSHON-HARRISON-@1 : It 's really too many to count. Just about 10 that I can name in the last four years. @!ZAHN : And what were the circumstances surrounding their murders? @!HARRISON : It was -- it was for no reason most of the time. Sometimes it was for drugs. Sometimes it was, like, just being at the wrong place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but life goes on. @!ZAHN : How tough is it for you to wake up every morning and try to psych yourself up to go to school... @!HARRISON : It 's hard. @!ZAHN :... knowing that you could be a victim? @!HARRISON : You get -- you get nervous a lot but sometimes you just got to live with it. But, see, you get over it after awhile. You do n't think about it as much. If it keeps happening, you do n't think about it as much. Like the first couple of times it happened, it hurt. But now it -- it still hurts, but I 'm used to it. @!ZAHN : What is it that you wanted legislators to walk away from that hearing feeling yesterday? @!HARRISON : Feeling sympathy for the people 's families who was killed. Feeling like they owe them since their children and things were killed. They need to be comforted and everything and give the parents out there hope ; the parents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children will be able to grow up and live their dreams and stuff. @!ZAHN : Zoe, yesterday you talked about losing your father to muggers, muggers who were the same age as -- as you were. @!ZOE-JOHNSTONE-@1Hi : Uh-huh. @!ZAHN : What is the message that you think must be heard today by parents and by legislators? @!JOHNSTONE : That this -- the violence and the guns, it all has to stop and it 's -- it 's too bad now this is as intolerable as it is now, and it has to stop. @!ZAHN : We heard story after story after story yesterday of children losing parents, of children losing friends to gunfire, what was it like to sit in that hearing room and hear those... @!JOHNSTONE : It was very moving. @!ZAHN :... painful stories? @!JOHNSTONE : It was very sad. It was just -- it was terrible. @!ZAHN : And the irony of all of this, Representative Schumer, is they were testifying at a time that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town to lobby congressmen and congresswomen to vote against a ban on assault weapons. What does this tell us? Congressman CHARLES SCHUMER( Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice) : Well, it 's what 's wrong with government in Washington. I wanted to bring the kids here because they would n't be here on their own. They do n't have lobbyists, and, yet, to see the personal stories, you know, I just wish every American, every member of Congress could see the 11 young men and young women sitting in front of us from all walks of life, all races, all religions. Every one of them had suffered tragedy. Every one of them was robbed of their childhood. Even if we passed all the laws we wanted tomorrow, they 've had to grow up much more quickly and -- but I -- you have to make it a personal message. The abstract numbers do n't get to people, legislators and anyone else. The lobbyists are there in force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony that Rushon and Zoe and their compatriots had, there was n't a dry eye in the house, and one of our most conservative members and one of our most liberal members, who argue all the time, reached out and shook hands at the end of the hearing and said, ' We have to do something. ' @!ZAHN : What are you going to do? @!Cong-SCHUMER : There 's a lot that can be done. Banning assault weapons is -- is the first step. @!ZAHN : Will that make it in the crime bill? @!Cong-SCHUMER : It will probably, but amazingly as it seems, it 's a very close vote. It 's passed the Senate ; we 're within five votes one way or the other in the House, and I hope people who saw the hearing yesterday, who hear from Rushon and Zoe and share a little bit of their pain, will just let their legislators know. No more of this kowtowing to the NRA and to these extremist gun nuts who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American people or what 's happening out there. @!ZAHN : Will we see a bill passed that will include 100,000 extra police officers on the street? @!Cong-SCHUMER : I believe we will. I believe we will. @!ZAHN : This three-strikes-you're-out provision? @!Cong-SCHUMER : Yes. I think we 're going to pass all of those. I 'm working very hard with some of my colleagues to get them passed. You know, the anguish... @!ZAHN : How tough of a fight, though, are you going to have on your hands? @!Cong-SCHUMER : It 's a tough, tough fight, Paula. The anguish of the American people has not quite yet broken through. It 's beginning to. @!ZAHN : Why is that? @!Cong-SCHUMER : Why it is, it 's a mystery to me. I 've thought about it for a long time. I think a lot of the issue, you get the idealogs of the left and the right sort of arguing these little arcane constitutional points and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real, banning assault weapons is real -- real, three strikes and you 're out is real. And we have to give the -- these people -- what happen -- because we had 11 kids lined up at the hearing, some went to the fanciest private schools, some came from the poorest of neighborhoods, it was clear it affected everybody. These were not isolated incidents. @!ZAHN : Representative Schumer, Zoe and Rushon, thank you very much for being with us this morning. It is 15 minutes after the hour. Coming up next, Arnold Diaz points the finger at Medicare and a company that may have gotten more of your tax dollars than it should have.
