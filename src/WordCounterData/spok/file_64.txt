231541 BRYANT @!GUMBEL, host : At their core, most stories are basically about heroes and villains. In his time, Bob Cooley could lay claim to being both. The son of a cop, he became a high-rolling lawyer for the mob, a fixer, who spread cash to set wise guys free. Then one day, he struck a deal with the feds, and since then, he has continually risked his life to deal a crippling blow to organized crime. Tonight, in a PUBLIC EYE exclusive, our Carol Marin details the twisted times of Bob Cooley. @!DISHONOR-THY-FATHE# @(Footage-of-Marin-a) @!CAROL-MARIN-report : This look familiar to you down here? @!Mr-ROBERT-COOLEY : Oh, yeah. @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Robert Cooley is back in his hometown, but there are reasons for him to be afraid here. This is where your action was. @!Mr-COOLEY : This was it. @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) It was on these streets that he blew wide open the mob 's control over law and order. Bob Cooley was not just any attorney who represented organized crime, he was a fixer extraordinaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them go away with an envelope of the mob 's cold cash. By your account, how many people have you bribed? @!Mr-COOLEY : Judges : over 30. I -- I went for years without losing a case. We were n't supposed to lose our cases. We had to win everything. And, again, I 'm not bragging, I 'm just telling you that 's the way it was. I mean, I bribed judges, states attorneys, police. I bribed a lot of people. I mean, that was just the system. @(Footage-of-court-b) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) But 11 years ago, Bob Cooley turned on that system with a vengeance, going undercover for the government to break the mob 's stranglehold over politics and the courts. He has never talked openly about what compelled him to turn on the mob until now, in an interview conducted in a remote and undisclosed location. @(Footage-of-Marin-a) @!MARIN : So you carried with you the full clout of the mob? @!Mr-COOLEY : Most certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capone, the mob has pulled the strings of some of Chicago 's most powerful people. Robert Cooley 's boss had once been an enforcer in the Capone era named Pat Marcy ; now he ordered the fixes and Cooley made them happen. @!Mr-COOLEY : Pat asked me if I had a judge that could take care of a matter, a murder case. @(Footage-of-Harry-A) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Cooley says there was one case, one fix, that haunted him for years. Harry " The Hit Man " Aleman was considered by police to be one of the mob 's coldest killers. The year was 1977 and Aleman had been charged with the murder of a Teamster. @!Mr-COOLEY : And Pat basically tells me, ' We 're gon na fix the case and you 're gon na do it. ' And I was afraid to tell him no. @!MARIN : Because? @!Mr-COOLEY : Well, because of -- you know, you do n't tell Pat, ' No. ' I wound up using somebody that had never fixed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooley called an old friend, Judge Frank Wilson, who had an honest reputation, but a weakness for alcohol. So if you used Frank Wilson, people might not smell a fix? @!Mr-COOLEY : That was the way I felt, and he obviously, you know, felt the same way. @(Footage-of-Aleman-) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) But there were problems, big ones. The state had two eyewitnesses who testified that Aleman was the hit man. Wilson, who was both judge and jury in the trial, began to worry. He wanted out. @!Mr-COOLEY : I made that clear to him that once we got in, we were in. I mean, if this judge finds him guilty, I 've got a very serious problem. @!MARIN : What is your serious problem if this judge finds him guilty? @!Mr-COOLEY : I 'm certain that Harry will -- well it -- it 'll get me killed. I 'm certain of that. qwq @( Photo-of-Wilson ; -f @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) In the end, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, $ 10,000. And Harry Aleman, the hit man, walked out of court a free man. The public was outraged, and Judge Frank Wilson was ruined. @!Mr-COOLEY : And he never recovered from it ; retired afterwards. @!MARIN : So the judge took the heat but you were a hero? @!Mr-COOLEY : To certain people, yeah. Even at this stage, I realize that they actually used me to burn somebody who was a good friend of mine. @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) But Cooley could not leave the life he 'd chosen, a high life, bought by the rackets, big bucks in gambling with the mob 's bookies. @!Mr-COOLEY : Sometimes $ 1 million -- close to $ 1 million in a weekend in actual bets. I had weeks where I won a couple hundred thousand. There were weeks when I lost -- I lost that much. @(Vintage-photos-of-) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Remarkably, Bob Cooley had been born into a family of policemen. His grandfather was a cop. His father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be promoted beyond patrolman. As a young man, Cooley carried a badge and the family honor. Now he was betraying its very foundation. Did your family know what you were doing? @!Mr-COOLEY : My family knew, you know, who I was representing and who the people were. My -- my father was n't happy with that. @(Vintage-photos-of-) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) It was only after his father 's death in 1980 that Cooley says he began to try and pull away from the mob, but the mob kept pulling him back. @!Mr-COOLEY : I was afraid to -- to lose the life that I had and I knew that the c -- what the consequences were once I did it. @(Footage-of-funeral) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Cooley knew that the mob 's revenge is cold, calculating and deadly, and he remembered the way others had died. @!Mr-COOLEY : Little Tony Borsellino. @!MARIN : What happened to him? @!Mr-COOLEY : They whacked him. @!MARIN : Why? @!Mr-COOLEY : I -- I have no idea. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Butch Petrocelli? @!Mr-COOLEY : They took a blowtorch to him. Sammy Onerino -- they shotgunned him. @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Cooley says the final break came in 1986, when the mob called once again. @(Photos-of-injured-) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) A Chicago policewoman had been brutally beaten and Cooley was being ordered to fix the case and free the accused. He did n't want the case and warned his boss, Pat Marcy, that the police would be watching closely. Marcy, he says, replied... @!Mr-COOLEY : ' Who would dare( censored) with us? ' -- words to that effect. I just looked at him and I said to myself, ' Somebody will. ' @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) And somebody did. @(Footage-of-federal) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Weeks later, Robert Cooley walked into the federal building and the US attorneys ' office. Scott Mendeloff was the deputy chief of special prosecutions. @!Mr-SCOTT-MENDELOFF : Oh, the government knew who he was in the sense that they knew he was an attorney, but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a case on him. @(Footage-of-Marin-a) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) But Cooley could give the government a case it had always wanted. For three years, Cooley secretly recorded the bribes of judges, the corrupt acts of lawyers, the buying and selling of legislation by politicians and the extortion, gambling and murderous acts of mobsters. One by one, they went to court and, because of Cooley 's testimony, one by one, they went to prison -- three judges, a state senator, an alderman, lawyers, a court clerk, businessmen and mobsters. So what did make Bob Cooley decide to cooperate? @!Mr-MENDELOFF : My impression was that Bob felt that he had let his father down by the life that he had chosen and wanted to rectify that. @!MARIN : How dangerous was it to do what he did? @!Mr-MENDELOFF : Extraordinarily dangerous. @!Mr-COOLEY : I never expected to survive. @!MARIN : Why not? @!Mr-COOLEY : I just never imagined I would. I felt that eventually, they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to me. @(Footage-of-Marin-a) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) But Cooley lived to tell his tale, and this fall, he was on the witness stand again ; this time, with tears in his eyes as he spoke of his old friend Frank Wilson, the judge who took a bribe and set a hit man free. Do you remember when you heard that he had killed himself? @!Mr-COOLEY : I remember, yeah. @!MARIN : And what did you think? @!Mr-COOLEY : I just... @!MARIN : Did you think, ' I did it '? @!Mr-COOLEY : I do n't know what I thought. No, I just -- I felt bad. I mean, I felt very bad. I do n't want to think about that. I ca n't do anything about that, so I just hope it was n't me. @(Footage-of-Aleman) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) And remember Harry " The Hit Man " Aleman? It took 20 years, but last month, because of Bob Cooley 's testimony, Harry " The Hit Man " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case that 's currently making US legal history because, for the first time ever in this country, the constitutionally protected provision against double jeopardy did n't apply. The court ruled that because the judge had been bribed the first time around, double jeopardy went out the window. @(Footage-of-court-b) @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Harry Aleman will be sentenced next week. The Aleman case may mark the end of Cooley 's work for the government, but then again, it may not. Cooley has more secrets to tell, specifically about a current Chicago alderman and cases Cooley says the alderman tried to fix. @!Mr-COOLEY : Murder cases. @!Mr-MENDELOFF : He 's still in danger. The kind of blow that he led, that he helped strike against the Mafia, is one that many people will never forget, never forgive. And he has to live the rest of his life looking behind his shoulder. @!MARIN : @(Voiceover) Bob Cooley now lives far from Chicago, moving at least a dozen times by his count, in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knows who I am. When I shop, I use coupons. @!MARIN : Are you a sympathetic character? @!Mr-COOLEY : I do n't think so. Why would I be sympathetic? I 've done what I wanted to do. @(Voiceover) And I just felt that, you know, I 've got to undo it. And I think I did undo it. I think I paid my -- my penance in full. @!GUMBEL : Carol, Bob Cooley never officially applied for the Wit -- Witness Protection Program. Why not? @!MARIN : He -- he does n't really describe his circumstances, but he 's a very independent person. He was not under investigation. The government did n't really know who he was or what he did. @!GUMBEL : He just came in? @!MARIN : So he was found guilty of no crime ; he had demonstrated he resolved his gambling debts. He showed them a tape with the mobsters saying, ' You do n't have to pay that. ' So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own man through this. @!GUMBEL : Does he have family? @!MARIN : He does, indeed. He has a large family in Chicago : a family of lawyers, former policemen, a priest. @!GUMBEL : Just curious ; Pat Marcy, the mobster he worked for, where is he today? @!MARIN : Pat Marcy did get indicted. He died during trial. @!GUMBEL : Carol, thanks so very much. Appreciate it. @!MARIN : Thank you, Bryant. @!GUMBEL : When we come back, the first prime-time interview with the doctor who earlier today delivered the McCaughey septuplets. Stay with us. @(Announcements)
