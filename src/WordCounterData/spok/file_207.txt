4104141 @!SCOTT, FOX HOST @(voice-over) : On FOX NEWS WATCH -- @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!JAY-CARNEY-WHITE-: We believe that you all ought to do your jobs and report on context. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: -- White House spin man, Jay Carney, wants the D.C. press to report on context. But who defines the context on the White House leaks, the Fast and Furious scandal, a possible contempt of Congress charge against the attorney general, the commerce secretary 's hit-and-run accidents after a seizure, all stories plaguing the White House and getting media attention. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES: There will be no shortage of gaffs and controversies. I recently made my own unique contribution to that process. @(LAUGHTER) @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: The president 's " private sector is doing fine " comment is still getting coverage, but are the liberal media dismissing the meaning of his message? @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @(GUNFIRE) @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: The civil war in Syria, relations with Russia, tensions with Iran, and the economic meltdown in Europe all raising questions about Mr. Obama 's foreign policies. But have the media been glossing over the concerns? @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BILL-MAHER-COMEDI: I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Mormon. @(LAUGHTER) It 's a stupid religion and a stupid country. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: Liberal loud mouth Bill Maher attacks Mitt Romney 's religion, then calls our nation stupid. And Bush 41 gets the HBO treatment. Was it fair? @(on-camera) : On the panel this week, writer and FOX News contributor, Judy Miller ; Richard Grenell, former spokesman for the last four U.S. ambassadors to the U.N. ; Jim Pinkerton, contributing editor, the " American Conservative " magazine ; and " Daily Beast " columnist, Kirsten Powers. I 'm Jon Scott. FOX NEWS WATCH is on right now. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: Can you assure that the White House and the people who speak for President Obama will not take somewhat unflattering sentence @(ph) of Governor Romney and use it out of context? @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: What 's the White House 's view of the deal reached in the European Union, this week 's agreement -- does that change -- does that change the intensity of tensions in Europe? @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: I want to ask, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's announcement? @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: Fast and Furious, the House is moving towards a vote on contempt charges. What 's the White House view on this? @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: How can you say, unequivocally, that it 's wrong and absurd? Have you done an internal investigation? @!UNIDENTIFIED-REPOR: Why is the whole process of resolving the issue of supply routes in such trouble at this point? @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: Could it be getting tougher for White House press secretary, Jay Carney, to spin the news in favor of President Obama? Jim, you 've got to feel for the guy. @(LAUGHTER) He took a whole load of questions like that at that White House briefing on Monday and the reporters would n't let up. @!JIM-PINKERTON-CON: They would n't and did n't let up all week. And this was all supposed to change with President Obama 's speech in Cleveland. And in a complete man-bites-dog, I have to say, news-worthy spin turn around, the liberal media clobbered the president. I know I 'm -- have a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that. @(LAUGHTER) But when you see Jonathan Alter and Joe Klein and Dana Milbank and Melinda Henneberger pounding away on that speech -- Milbank called it a falsehood wrapped in a fallacy -- and that 's a pretty tough week. @!SCOTT: Jonathan Alter says it 's one of the worst he 's heard. @!PINKERTON: Yes. And interestingly, Mickey Kaus, who writes for " The Daily Caller, " citing a blogger named Richard Rushfield @(ph) out in L.A., says it 's a phenomenon of Twitter. What 's happening now, when you do the same old speech over and over again, same old stuff, the media are so bored with it, even if they kind of like you, they nonetheless tear it up because they want something new to do, as opposed to simply rehash the old stuff. @!SCOTT: Jay Carney challenged reporters to put it in context. Who is minding the context? Who gives the definition? @!JUDY-MILLER-WRITE: The media decides the context, clearly, and Jay Carney was unhappy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the reporters ate their spinach or what 's going on, but they were acting like reporters. That what they 're supposed to be doing, asking the tough questions. And poor Mr. Carney just came in for it this weekend. @(LAUGHTER) @!SCOTT: The president, when he made " the private sector doing fine " remark, it was described as a gaffe and, in fact, he even seemed to say so in the clip we played at the top of the program. Is that kind of an easy out for what it was, and what he meant? @!KIRSTEN-POWERS-CO: Well, that 's the question. The question is, was it a gaffe where he just meant to say, as compared to the private -- the public sector, it 's doing fine, or is this actually what President Obama thinks about the economy? And so it 's, depending where you 're sitting, you might have a different perspective on that. But whenever a politician makes a gaff, they 're saying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look, it 's not the media 's job to clean up his mess. So the idea that they are being told, you know, why are n't you fixing this? That 's not their job. @!RICHARD-GRENELL-F: I think that the context was worse for this White House. When you look at the context, this was n't a gaffe. A gaffe is when the president says a polish death camp. That 's a gaff. We know he did n't mean that. But in this context, when the economy is fine, if you read the whole context, he doubles down on this philosophical bent argument that mayors and governors are to blame and that the economy -- he gives statistics. He says the economy is 4.3 million jobs, 800,000 this year alone. This was not a gaffe. This was a well-thought out contextual argument against that private sector is fine and the public sector is what needs to grow. @!PINKERTON: I think Rick has a point and that is, the context, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been saying this every day for three years now, that the public sector needs to be pumped up with more money and deficits and spending and so on. Yes, if you 're reading " The New York Times, " like everybody in the Obama White House is, you 're getting a daily dose of it 's the public sector is shrinking tragically because we 're not spending enough on the government. @!MILLER: He made the point on Friday in his Friday column. @!POWERS: but I think that the issue is the president did n't mean to -- just that line was a gaffe in the sense it just gave the opponents just this perfect line to make him look like he 's out of touch. @!SCOTT: We also saw a first in the media this week, take a look. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BRAIN-WILLIAMS-AN: In Washington today, Attorney General Eric Holder took heavy fire from Republican critics in a Senate hearing, and calls for his resignation are growing louder, but Democrats contend it 's all about politics in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because after months of coverage on FOX News channel and other outlets, that was the first mention of Fast and Furious by " NBC Nightly News, " Rick. @!GRENELL: It 's remarkable, right? This is has been a story that 's been out there a very long time and the mainstream media just has not covered it. They viewed this as a partisan issue. And it 's really been remarkable. And I think NBC admitted this week that they are behind the story. @!SCOTT: Texas Senator John Cornyn announced this week he wants him to resign. He 's not normally considered a bomb thrower, even among Republicans in the Senate, but it barely got any coverage, his request. @!POWERS: Yes. I think this is a partisan witch hunt, but that does n't mean that the media should n't be covering it. The Valerie Plame investigation was a partisan witch hunt and they covered that. They covered it quite enthusiastically, as Judy knows. @(LAUGHTER) @!MILLER: Yes, as I know. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterested in this when it 's something that has been going on and gets a lot of attention in the conservative media -- and even at the " Daily Beast, " where I write, they 've actually covered it quite a lot. And that the mainstream media has mostly ignored it is a problem. @!SCOTT: Under the heading of coincidence or media manipulation, we have this. " Time " magazine ran its cover story called " We are Americans, only we just are not legal. " " The New York Times " on Sunday ran a story on frustrated Hispanic -- " The Frustrated Hispanic Electorate. " And then on Friday came the surprise announcement that the Department of Justice is going to ease up on deporting the illegal immigrant children or young people or offspring in this country. It that any coincidence? @!MILLER: Utter coincidence. @(LAUGHTER) @!MILLER: I mean, clearly, everything that the president does from this point on that affects the Hispanic community is going to be seen in a political light. Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in a sense instance I think -- @(CROSSTALK) @!PINKERTON: The interesting question is whether " The New York Times " and " Time " magazine had any inkling that the president would be doing this and wanted to get ahead of the story or get credit for being a part of the wave. That 's an interesting question. @!MILLER: No, you do n't think they would have reported it if they had an inkling? @!PINKERTON: Actually, as a matter of fact, I 'm pretty sure they would n't have reported it because they wanted the scoop. They did n't want to blow up their own story by saying -- if they get a wink from their friend Eric Holder or Axelrod or any of these people, hey, the administration does something good, they want to be a part of it. @!MILLER: They wanted the story. @(LAUGHTER) @!PINKERTON: They 've got the story but now they get credit for having impact. They can say, we 're moving the needle. @!GRENELL: As a former spokesman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you unequivocally someone briefed " Time " and " New York Times " to say this announcement is coming, if you can hold it till a certain time, we 'll give you access. That 's how it works. And in this case, absolutely, that is how it happened. @!SCOTT: That 's the inside view. Next on NEWS WATCH, are the media acting as apologists for Mr. Obama 's foreign policies. @!ANNOUNCER: Nuclear threats from Iran, civil war in Syria, pandering to Pakistan, chilled relations with Russia -- President Obama 's foreign policies causing concerns around the world. Are the media making excuses for his failures? @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MAHER: I would say, in a hundred years, this country will be Mormon. @(LAUGHTER) It 's a stupid religion and a stupid country. They were made for each other. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ANNOUNCER: Is he a comedian, a political pundit or an anti-American bigot? Bill Maher strikes again. Is it time for HBO to pull the plug? All next, on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, U.N. officials and our secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said Syria is getting closer to an all-out civil war. That designation would trigger the Geneva Conventions on conducting war. Also on Syria, this little items from " Time " magazine : " U.S. officials have revealed to " Time, " the Obama administration has been providing media- technology training and support to the Syrian dissidents. " Is this another high-level leak, Rick, do you think? @!GRENELL: Let 's hope not. Certainly, there 's a pattern of leaks from this administration. It started early on in the administration. I hope it 's not. I hope it 's just individuals trying to push positive stories about the administration and maybe going too far, and now they 're going to dial that back. There needs to be a longer-view take. And as someone who was dealing with intel and talking to reporters all the time, it 's a very touchy situation. You 've got to remember what 's intel, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pushing positive stories and making sure that your boss looks good. It 's a difficult road. I 'm hoping it was n't planned. @!SCOTT: What about this whole flap over the attack helicopters? Secretary of State Clinton said that Russia was sending attack helicopters to Syria. It turns out apparently they were Syria 's own helicopters that had been refurbished and sent back to Syria. Did it get the kind of coverage that it deserved? @!POWERS: I do n't think foreign policy generally gets the coverage it deserves. You can have lots of difference theories why it is. Part of it is because I think Americans are n't interested in it generally. And add in the fact that the economy is doing bad, so they 're much more interested in what 's going on here. So I do n't think it 's unusual for them to not pay attention to even extremely important stories going on. I do n't think there 's any bias per se that is liberal or conservative. I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria, right, Judy? Why would the Assad regime let them come in? @!MILLER: They 've not only let the reporters in, they 're letting the United Nations observers go to the areas where there have been massacres. And they 're almost showing them the handiwork of these terrible militias that are aligned with the administration. Almost as if they 're daring the world 's community to do something about it. I think that the Syrian regime has concluded that the world is not going to do anything about it. And this is where you really yearn for something other than what the " New Yorker " called Obama 's leading-from- behind policy. I mean, as people are being slaughtered, one wants a little more. @!SCOTT: The Syrians probably would n't be doing as well as they are without help from Iran. The Obama administration has announced, with great fanfare, the sanctions on Iran. Are they working? @!GRENELL: It 's absolutely clear sanctions are not working. They did n't work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is a terrible situation for the media, who keeps buying this argument that sanctions are working. And if oil sanctions worked, we would see it in two months. The nation would be crippled. And it would cause Iran to stumble quickly. @!MILLER: Oh, I think there 's a different way of working. And what -- I think the -- one of the goals of the sanctions, at this point, is to separate the Sunni business class from the Alawite minority regime so that they lose their base. That may be a longer-term strategy. The problem is people are being killed in the short-term. @!SCOTT: Jim, the economy, the number-one issue for the elections in 2012. Europe obviously coming into play. Do you think the media are making the connection for voters between what 's going on in Europe and this country? @!PINKERTON: Yes. I think they 're covering the Euro thing pretty heavily. I think that 's getting a lot -- and what is astonishing to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were, was the Egyptian semi coupe -- @(LAUGHTER) -- and the headlines in the " Washington Post " on Friday, ruling bolsters Egypt 's old guard. If that 's not a snooze headline, what is? @(LAUGHTER) Nobody has any idea. And the fact is the military just overturned the civilian government. And that would be news to me. But I think the problem is media, A, realized nobody cares. and they also do n't want to force the Obama administration into doing something about it. Let 's face it, we 've got enough to chew on in Syria and elsewhere. @!POWERS: It also goes against their whole narrative of -- that the Arab Spring and change is coming and this is what really was supposed to happen according to the media -- @(CROSSTALK) @!GRENELL: Iran clearly loved it, though. They 're using the time. @!SCOTT: And the president invited Hosni Mubarak to get out of office, too. We have more NEWS WATCH ahead. But if you see something that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newwatch@FOXnews.com Up next, Bill Maher strikes again. @!ANNOUNCER: Liberal big mouth Bill Maher slams Mormonism and our nation. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MAHER: It 's a stupid religion and a stupid country. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ANNOUNCER: And this is the guy that CNN lets sub-host in prime time? And HBO paints a positive portrait of Bush 41, but something very different and dark for Bush 43. Details next, on NEWS WATCH. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MAHER: Would it be better if the country got over the notion of American exceptionalism? Oh, I think it would. I mean this is -- @(APPLAUSE) This is, by the way, this is one of the reasons why -- and people laugh at me -- but I say in a hundred years this country will be Mormon. @(LAUGHTER) It 's a stupid religion and a stupid country. They were made for each other. @(LAUGHTER) And -- @(APPLAUSE) And I tell you, one of the things Americans are going to love about Mormonism, when they find out about it, is, first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American in Mormonism. And they love the idea that Mormons embrace more than anybody, that we are the super-duper star- spangled best country ever. And if we had any flaw, it 's that we make other countries feel bad because our awesomeness is so overwhelming. @(LAUGHTER) @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: That 's Bill Maher, explaining his disdain for the phrase " American exceptionalism, " calling the U.S. stupid and taking a shot at the Mormon religion in the process. @!HBO-gives-him-that# @!PINKERTON: Well, maybe money. Look it, it 's telling -- there 's an audience for it, too. He 's got at least however many people in that live audience in L.A. that are clapping for him. Look, this is a -- to think that his words kind of speak for themselves, but it does say something about where you can make a living in this country. @!SCOTT: Rick, what if you replaced America, say, with Iran in that little diatribe and you started trashing Islam, for instance, in that bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down on you. It 's ironic that he 's making these statements in Los Angeles. He 's not making these statements in Cairo or at the United Nations. To suggest that the United States is just one of 193 other countries is ludicrous. It is the idea that Americans are not exceptional, which I think will become a huge political issue this year, and I think that Bill Maher is going to be on the losing end of that. @!SCOTT: He bought a piece of the New York Mets. And " The New York Times " did a glowing story about the purchase. Rush Limbaugh, a conservative, tried to buy a piece of, I think it was the Rams, and got hammered and basically told by the NFL that he could n't do it. Why? @!POWERS: The whole " New York Times " piece was delusional. Actually, it described a person that does not exist. Their description of Bill Maher -- @(LAUGHTER) -- has no connection to reality, including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit versus it being the central point of everything he says. And that he was a Libertarian? @(LAUGHTER) @!GRENELL: That 's right. @!POWERS: He 's an Obama supporter, a liberal. I thought maybe they meant libertine or something. @(LAUGHTER) I was n't sure if they got off on that one. But he says the most vile things. and the idea that he would get a glowing profile is disturbing. @!SCOTT: We have to take one more back. When we come back, HBO takes a gentle look at Bush 41 and then something very different for Bush 43. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: What was it like to see your son elected president? @!GEORGE-H.W-BUSH-F: Very emotional for me, very proud father. It 's the first time it 's happened I guess in the history of our country or except for the Adams. It was bind- boggling. It was enormous. And it was a source of great pride for the family. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: HBO 's documentary " 41 " debuted this week, 100 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news and offering no fresh insights into the life of George H.W. Bush, who celebrated his 88th birthday this week. The film by Jerry Weintraub, producer of " Ocean 's 11 " and a Bush family friend, is described as fond and friendly, except the part where he talks about the press. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BUSH: I know I am going to sound like I 'm bashing the press but there was almost unanimity in the press corps that I should loose and that they were for him and that makes a huge difference. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SCOTT: Of course, FOX News was not around back then to add balance to the coverage. @!HBO-received-mostl# Also, this week, it was revealed that the HBO hit series " Game of Thrones " used a bust of George W. Bush in a scene with decapitated heads. Why? Producers say they needed a head and that was just lying around if you believe that. Both HBO and the producers of the series apologized, claiming the spiked head of our former president was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WATCH. Thanks to our Jim Pinkerton, Judy Miller, Kirsten Powers and Rick Grenell. I 'm Jon Scott. Thanks for watching. We 'll see you next week. '
