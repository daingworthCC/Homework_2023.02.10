234441 KATIE @!COURIC, co-host : Carol Burnett made her Broadway musical debut 40 years ago in " Once Upon a Mattress. " After that, she became a beloved member of most American households with the success of her Emmy-winning TV show. Well, now she 's back on the Broadway stage in a musical review of composer Stephen Sondheim 's work called " Putting It Together. " qwq @( Clip-of- " Putting-I @!COURIC : Carol Burnett, good morning. Lots of singing, a little squeaking there. I was just saying... @!Ms-CAROL-BURNETT : A little squeaky. It just comes out naturally that way. @!COURIC : How do you do that with that sort of funny little yodel thing that you do in the song? @!Ms-BURNETT : Well, I think it just -- just came, you know, when I was a kid and did the Tarzan yell, you know, so it 's just in there. @!COURIC : Are you having fun doing this show? @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes, I am. Of course. Stephen Sondheim is so fabulous. You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it 's spelled R-E-V-I-E-W... @!COURIC : Right. @!Ms-BURNETT :... which is like reviewing a -- his work, a great body of work, and this is n't everything, but there 's quite a bit in there. @!COURIC : And for people who have n't seen it, and there are probably many out there right now. @!Ms-BURNETT : Right, right. @!COURIC : It 's basically taking some of -- a lot of his great songs from a number of shows... @!Ms-BURNETT : Absolutely, yeah. @!COURIC : And they 're woven together with a storyline. @!Ms-BURNETT : With a kind of a little thin plotline. I call it, actually, in my mind it 's a musical Virginia Woolf. @!COURIC : Right. Because there is a lot of angst going on on-stage during these songs. @!Ms-BURNETT : Oh, yes. Oh, yeah, yeah. @!COURIC : And we were talking during the commercial break... @!Ms-BURNETT : And that 's not just the songs, it 's us. Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs, it was -- the songs to me, are -- are -- I mean, they 're wonderful, they 're so clever and witty, and -- and obviously fun to listen to, because there 's so much there. I know they 're -- they 're pretty hard to master, though, are n't they? @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes. I think that was probably the hardest thing I ever had to do was to -- to learn this piece. We did it... @!COURIC : And " I 'm Not Getting Married, " you said, was not the hardest? @!Ms-BURNETT : That was not the most difficult. The most difficult is one that George Hearn and I do called " Country House. " It 's a conversation musically that the husband and wife are having where they 're arguing and deciding what to do. And it overlaps, and it -- it was really -- it was a tough one to learn. But once you get them, they 're in there, forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're -- they 're -- they 're somewhat difficult on an emotional level, too. @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes. Yeah. @!COURIC : Because some of them are -- are very depressing, because they 're about love not enduring, about disillusionment and ennui and -- and people who have everything but they 're miserable. @!Ms-BURNETT : Well, so many wonderful songs are about that, you know, and that were n't just written by Stephen Sondheim. It 's just that these really get into it. @!COURIC : I mean, they 're -- they 're almost brutal that way. I mean, I like sort of like, " I 'm As Corny As Kansas in August. " I like those kinds of songs. @!Ms-BURNETT : It 's easy to remember. @!COURIC : And listening to these, you 're like, oh, my God, let 's go home and... @!Ms-BURNETT : Well, you have to pay attention, you really have to pay attention. Because every one of his songs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're -- every one of his songs is a three-act play. They -- you know, they have the beginning, the middle, the end, the third act, and then there 's a button, a punch at the end of it that sometimes you do n't expect. So you really have to pay attention. @!COURIC : An example of that is " Could You -- Could I Leave You? " @!Ms-BURNETT : " Could I Leave You? " You know, which is ' Could I leave you? Yes. Will I leave you? ' And you wonder where she 's going with that. Guess. Ooh. @!COURIC : You and George Hearn play -- play the -- the older couple who sort of -- they 're -- they 're sick of each other. @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes. They 're married -- yeah, yeah. @!COURIC : And then there 's a younger couple. @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes. John Barryman and Ruthie Henshall. @!COURIC : Ruthie Henshall. And they 're wonderful. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the evening, you know, so he 's our Puck. @!COURIC : What do you think took you so long to get back on Broadway in a musical? I know, of course, you were in " Moon Over Buffalo " a few years back. @!Ms-BURNETT : Yes, uh-huh. Yeah. @!COURIC : But this is your first musical in 40 years. @!Ms-BURNETT : Really? @!COURIC : Yes. Sorry. @!Ms-BURNETT : Oh, my gosh. I 'd better go back to bed. Well, Stephen Sondheim. Stephen Sondheim. You know, I do n't think I would want to come back and do something new or go from scratch. Although this is, in a way, for me. But it 's -- it 's his -- it 's a challenge. It 's an acting piece. Not just musical. You know? @!COURIC : And -- and -- and to be totally superficial, I have to say, you -- you have the best legs in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, well, thank you. @!COURIC :... wow, she has incredible gams. @!Ms-BURNETT : I 'm glad I shaved this morning. @!COURIC : And -- and wore a -- wore a short skirt and showing them off. And anyway, how do you stay in such great shape? @!Ms-BURNETT : I -- I -- thank you. I do n't know. I... @!COURIC : Do you exercise? @!Ms-BURNETT : Well, the legs are the last thing to go, I guess. @!COURIC : Do you exercise regularly? @!Ms-BURNETT : Only on-stage. Only when I 'm doing... @!COURIC : Really? @!Ms-BURNETT : Which is great. Because I -- I 'll eat dinner early. And then you work it out -- off on-stage, and then I do n't eat anything afterwards, so that helps. @!COURIC : You must have good genes. Well, it 's great to see you. @!Ms-BURNETT : Thanks, Katie. @!COURIC : You 're wonderful in the show and -- and so funny, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thank you. @!COURIC : Nice to see you. Bye, Carol. Carol Burnett. And " Putting It Together " opens here in New York on November 21st. I was lucky to see it in previews on Saturday night. And we 'll be back with more of TODAY right after this. *** @!COURIC : So, Matt, I forgot Carol -- to get Carol Burnett to do her trademark, you know? @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos : She 's probably only done that a few times in the last several years. @!COURIC : Yeah, exactly. Anyway, still to come this morning, what women need to know about cholesterol. @!LAUER : And we 're going to do a little fly-fishing right out in Rockefeller Plaza. But first, your local news.
