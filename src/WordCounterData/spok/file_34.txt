224841 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : Topic A this morning : the death of a doctor. We want to get a couple of very different takes on the shooting death of Florida abortion Dr. David Gunn. Randall Terry is the founder of the anti-abortion Operation Rescue. He joins us from WBNG-TV in Binghamton, New York. And with me here in Washington is Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Good morning to you both. @!Ms-KATE-MICHELMAN- : Good morning, Harry. @!SMITH : What was your immediate reaction yesterday when you heard the news? @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Well, I think, like many Americans, I was absolutely devastated. It 's a horrible occurrence. A man has been gunned down in the service of reproductive health in this country, a father of two, a man who braved day in and day out anti-choice and religious extremists in order to provide the services for women in that community. And I -- I want to say at the outset here we can not delude ourselves into believing that this is somehow some isolated incident. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood silently by why a -- while a campaign of intolerance and violence has occurred in this country. I 'm talking about the arsons, the bombings, the blockades, the chemical attacks, the -- the kidnapping, the stalkings, the terroristic harassment of doctors and their families. This incident is borne out of that intolerance. @!SMITH : You were n't surprised by this. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : I was not surprised -- horrified, devastated. But it was going to happen. @!SMITH : Randall Terry, let me ask you what was your reaction to what happened yesterday? @!Mr-RANDALL-TERRY-@ : Well, I was shocked and I was repulsed. This is an absolutely inappropriate repulsive act that Michael Griffin has done to David Gunn. But we need to remember that this man, David Gunn, has single-handedly killed thousands and thousands of children throughout Florida, Mississippi and Georgia. So while we grieve for him and for his widow and for his children, we must also grieve for the thousands of children that he has murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question. How could somebody who is supposedly pro-life justify murdering somebody? @!Mr-TERRY : I do n't know. It 's wrong. @!SMITH : You condemn what happened yesterday? @!Mr-TERRY : Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. But we equally condemn what Kate Michelman stands for and what David Gunn stood for : the murder of innocent children. I mean, yesterday one abortionist was murdered, which is horrifying and that 's the first time in this century that we know of that that 's happened. But also yesterday 4,500 children were murdered in cold blood. And I -- I do n't see very much grief coming from Kate about that. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Well, first of all, what I stand for is the fundamental principle of choice, of the freedom of choice, the basic right of women to make reproductive decisions. What Randall Terry has just said appalls me. To use the murder of a doctor to -- as an opportunity to, again, inflame rhetoric and to create, again, the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whatever way... @!Mr-TERRY : No, no, no, no, no. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Wait a minute, Randall, please. Do n't interrupt. I did n't... @!SMITH : Randall, hang on one second. Go on. Finish your sentence. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : The fact is that is the kind of -- the kind of climate that Randall Terry and Operation Rescue has created in this country, a climate of intolerance and harassment and terrorism... @!Mr-TERRY : Kate -- Kate... @!Ms-MICHELMAN :... that has led to Griffin murdering, gunning down a doctor, a hero. @!Mr-TERRY : Kate, your nose is growing. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : So... @!SMITH : All right. Hang on. Ra -- look, Randall Terry, let me ask you the question that -- that Kate Michelman brings up, that : Is there not an atmosphere of intolerance? And it 's -- the -- the -- the nature of these protests, are they not more than just a -- a benign -- there 's certainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... amongst many of these people. @!Mr-TERRY : Harry, we make no bones about it. We do not tolerate child killing. We despise child killing. But the 60,000 arrests that have occurred over the past five years, the hundreds of thousands of people that have been in the street have been peaceful. What happened yesterday is an aberration and Kate, frankly, should be happy... @!Ms-MICHELMAN : It is not an aberration. I 'm sorry. @!Mr-TERRY : Excuse me, Kate -- Kate should be thankful for the leadership of Operation Rescue because we insist that people commit to non-violence. We are committed to non-violence. We will continue to be committed to non-violence. And if she and her cohorts -- her feminist cohorts up in Washington, DC, get their way, they are going to be responsible in the Clinton administration for driving the fringe people that are out there to acts of extremism. @!SMITH : All right. Let... @!Mr-TERRY : If you take away the right of people to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it a felony to be involved in pro-life activism, then they are the ones that are responsible for what fringe people do out of frustration, not us. @!SMITH : O -- all right. Hang on one second. Thirty seconds just to respond to that -- to answer the charge that the Clinton administration is trying to do what Randall Te -- Terry said. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Well, it 's just complete nonsense. Randall Terry represents the extremist wing of his party -- of his -- of his movement. He has created a climate where this could happen. Congress must move quickly... @!Mr-TERRY : No. @!Ms-MICHELMAN :... to pass legislation that will protect women and doctors and personnel at the clinics and to establish a fundamental... @!Mr-TERRY : The murder of children has created this climate. @!Ms-MICHELMAN :... and establish a fundamental... @!Mr-TERRY : The murder of children, Kate, has -- is what has created this climate. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Excuse me, Randall. This is a basic... @!Mr-TERRY : Thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and stop immediately. And this is a basic right that needs to be protected. @!SMITH : Kate Michelman... @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Thank you. @!SMITH :... Randall Terry, we thank you for joining us this morning. @!Ms-MICHELMAN : Thank you. @!SMITH : Paula. @!PAULA-ZAHN-@1Co-ho : We 're moving up on just about 16 minutes after the hour, Harry. Coming up next : A defense attorney gives us his take on the Rodney King trial. And tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING : Arnold Diaz on real estate dealers who still discriminate against minorities ; plus, a woman dedicated to saving the elephants ; and Paul Newman in a brand-new movie.
