238941 BOB @!EDWARDS, host : This is NPR 's MORNING EDITION. I 'm Bob Edwards. Studies show one of the fundamental changes taking place within the American family is that it is gradually becoming more egalitarian, especially among two-job couples. A recent survey found a solid majority of women and men in agreement that there should be equal sharing in the home front when both parents work full time. The practice of dividing household chores and child-care duties 50:50 remains the exception. Nevertheless, it 's growing. NPR 's David Molpus reports. @!DAVID-MOLPUS-repor : How to divide the workload on the home front when husbands and wives both have careers is one of the most contentious issues in marriages today, according to social psychologists such as Francine Deutsch of Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Professor FRANCINE DEUTSCH( Social Psychologist, Mt. Holyoke College) : The truth is in most families today, whether equal or not, people are negotiating about the work at home because roles are changing. @!MOLPUS : For several decades now women have been doing what used to be labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what used to be considered women 's work. Francine Deutsch says on occasion, usually after considerable struggle, the role switching leads to real equity in parenting and household chores. Deutsch examined just such couples in a study funded by the National Science Foundation. Equality, she says, comes in many varieties and can look quite traditional in some respects. @!Prof-DEUTSCH : There is no one-size-fits-all model. In some families I interviewed, mothers did more of the comforting or mothers held on to some job that they felt was particularly maternal. Fathers found other ways to contribute. @!MOLPUS : Several studies now suggest that mother and father contributions to child care are converging. Professor Deutsch assumes that those in the vanguard of this movement would be highly educated professionals committed to feminist values, but she learned that is not necessarily so. @!Prof-DEUTSCH : Middle-class families tend to be more liberal than working-class families. They tend to believe more in equality between the sexes. However, many middle-class families do n't really practice what they preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often practice more than they preach. @!MOLPUS : Deutsch presents her research, along with profiles of couples who are equally sharing parenting, in a book titled " Halving It All. " There is a tendency, she says, among upper middle-class families to balance career and child-care demands by outsourcing, relying on maids, lawn services, nannies and day-care centers. On the other hand, working-class couples who are achieving equality tend to do so by alternating their work shifts. As a University of California sociologist notes, 30 to 40 percent of parents with young children work non-day shifts. And Fran Deutsch found that many shift workers, regardless of economic standing, volunteer for the odd hours because it allows them to share in child care and avoid placing their children in the hands of strangers. Those were prime motivations behind Jim and Teesha Arakelian 's decision against day care. @!Mrs-TEESHA-ARAKELI : First of all, all the horror stories you hear scares you to death, and then the financial aspect. Child care is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just being a nurse, I guess I was more attuned to, you know, the fact that maybe she 'll get sicker and things like that. So we just thought we would try this first. @!MOLPUS : That was nine years ago when Jim Arakelian was a cop and Teesha was a nurse in River Edge, New Jersey. He took care of their two children from late afternoon to bedtime, then went to work at midnight. His wife went to work late in the day and watched the kids in the mornings, when Jim was asleep. Over the years their shifts have fluctuated -- he 's switched to selling houses now -- but the parenting and housework have remained a 50:50 split, more or less. @!Mr-JIM-ARAKELIAN : Sometimes. Sometimes it 's more 60:40 me, but she wo n't admit to that, I 'm sure. @!MOLPUS : Jim is right, she wo n't admit to that. Sometimes Teesha Arakelian says it 's a 90:10 split, with her doing 90 percent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim getting the children ready for school and later trekking them to birthday parties, dance lessons, karate. Teesha says the details of who does what is always evolving, but in the end it all pretty much evens out. Jim 's become one of the neighborhood moms, his wife says, and she teases him about that. He also puts up with light razzing from male buddies, who leave phone messages about being too domestic. @!Mr-ARAKELIAN : Hi. Is the woman of the house in? Hi. We 're going out tonight. Too bad you ca n't go. ' You know, just things like that, having a lot of friends that are cops, you know, that whole man thing and guy thing -- I just get harassed. What are you going to do? @!MOLPUS : Jim Arakelian says it 's been quite an adjustment for him to buy into this equality deal. Previously he thought of housework as trivial, and he admits he still relies on his wife to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home front. @!Mr-ARAKELIAN : Did I -- did I use the word remind '? I meant nag. No. @!MOLPUS : Despite his apparently foot-dragging at times, Jim Arakelian says equal sharing at home has been a blessing because, as he puts it, Now I know what my children are about, what they think and what they do. ' @(Soundbite-of-Jeff-) @!Mr-JEFF-KEOUGH : Hello? Hi. @!MOLPUS : For Jeff and Diane Keough(ph) of Boston, equal parenting works a bit differently. He 's a book editor and she 's in public relations. Throughout their 13-year marriage, they have equally shared home duties without much conflict. Since their son, Jack, was born nearly three months ago, Diane has been on maternity leave. When Jeff gets home, though, she immediately puts the baby in his arms for the rest of the evening. @!Mrs-KEOUGH : So he 's going to be ready to be fed in about an hour and a half. @!Mr-KEOUGH : OK. @!Mrs-KEOUGH : OK? @!Mr-KEOUGH : Mm-hmm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Daddy 's home. @!Mr-KEOUGH : OK, OK. @!MOLPUS : Shortly these roles will be reserved. Diane will return to her job, and Jeff will take paternity leave for a couple of months. Jeff says he 's really looking forward to the switch, and so is Diane. @!Mrs-KEOUGH : For me, it 's really important to have Jeff experience everything I experience. I do n't want the relationship to be the type of thing where he comes home from work and he does n't understand what 's been going on all day. And there 's so many magical moments and such surprises, and it 's such a joy to be with the baby, and I want him to experience that as well. @!MOLPUS : When Jeff 's paternity leave ends, he and his wife will each work one day a week from home so they 'll have to use outside child care only three days a week. The quality of day care is good in their area. Their decision to reduce dependence on day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else. @!Mr-KEOUGH : Whenever I 've thought about raising children, it has always been with the idea that I would play more of a role than, say, fathers of my father 's generation. It 's hard for me to tell if that 's a reaction against the way it used to be or just the way society has changed. I mean, I think there are a lot more equal relationships now and that they are leading to more equal parenting. @!MOLPUS : The real test for 50:50 sharing, experts say, often comes when a child gets sick. Which parent stays home is a pretty good indicator of whether the claim of equality is real. It 's one of the situations that makes this lifestyle hard to achieve. It requires compromise and shared sacrifice. But Fran Deutsch and other researchers are documenting the many ways it can be done when men learn new skill sets at home, when women give up some control over how things get done at home and when employment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!EDWARDS : It 's 11 minutes before the hour.
