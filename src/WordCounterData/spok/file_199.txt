Then we have comedian and actor Rick Younger who 's married with a toddler son, and has been on so many commercials this Christmas season, you ca n't turn on the TV without seeing... @!Mr-RICK-YOUNGER: I 'm just trying to feed that toddler son.

That 's a miracle. @!KOTB: That 's shocking. @!GIFFORD: OK. So here we are, guys. @!KOTB: All right. @!GIFFORD: Good to have you back. @!KOTB: All right. Let 's go across the street to Ms. Sara. Hey, Sara. @!SARA-HAINES-report: @!Hi-I'm-here-with-B# @!BRITNEY: Hi. I just recently turned 30 and I was wondering does the dating change after 30 and does guys still chase the woman they want? @!Mr-NICE: Yes. @!Mr-DAVID-GOOD: Yes. @!Mr-NICE: It 's just that those guys happen to be much older than 30. But they are still chasing what they want, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are 45, probably with kids -- probably with kids. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!Mr-GOOD: And, yeah, older. @!KOTB: Yeah, but does it change? I mean... @!GIFFORD: But a guy 30 does n't want a woman 30? Yeah. @!Mr-NICE: Sure. @!Mr-GOOD: I 'm 30. @!Mr-NICE: Would you go out with a 30-year-old? @!Mr-GOOD: No. @!Mr-NICE: Oh. @!Mr-JOE-LEVY: Oh! @!Mr-GOOD: Yeah. @!GIFFORD: Younger? @!KOTB: Why not? @!Mr-GOOD: Yeah, I want somebody younger. @!KOTB: But wait, why not? Why would n't you go out with this girl? She 's gorgeous. What about her? @!GIFFORD: She 's beautiful. @!Mr-GOOD: She is beautiful. Let -- all right, fine, set it up. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Well look, I 'm... @!Mr-GOOD: Let 's do it. @!GIFFORD: All right, we 're going to set it up. @!Mr-GOOD: Set it up, set it up. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Bring her up here right now. @!BRITNEY: All right. Sure. @!KOTB: Oh, my God. @!HAINES: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!GIFFORD: OK. We can make that happen. @!Mr-NICE: OK, I got to tell you, she did n't look very excited about that. I 'm just saying. I was looking at her, she was just like, ' What the heck did I get into? ' @!MR-GOOD: Maybe she wants somebody younger. She wants somebody younger. ' @!BRITNEY: No, no, no. I want a mature man, trust me. @!Mr-GOOD: You can move on, then. Get out of here. @!KOTB: All right, kids. @!GIFFORD: Wow, it 's hot in here. @!KOTB: Let 's get to our next question. This is a Facebook question from Kelley. Why do men look at other women and then act like they did n't? @!Mr-LEVY: All right, this is -- this is instinct vs. training. Instinct says look, training says, ' I should n't, so that 's what happens. @!Mr-YOUNGER: No. @!KOTB: Rick, what do you think? @!Mr-YOUNGER: Well, like I always say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful woman when I see one. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!Mr-YOUNGER: But I know my wife does n't want me just sitting there just like, ' Aaaa. ' @!Mr-LEVY: Well, that 's it. @!Mr-YOUNGER: So I, you know, I have to like, you know, if she 's walking down the street, I time it so that when she is going past... @!Mr-LEVY: You do. You got to time it. @!Mr-YOUNGER:... then I have a reason to look at something back that way. Bam. And then I keep moving forward. @!GIFFORD: And now you 're busted and now she knows. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Right. @!Mr-LEVY: Well I think -- I think she already knew. @!Mr-YOUNGER: I will change my technique now. I wanted to share that with the people out there and now I got a new one and I 'll let y'all know about that later. @!Mr-NICE: I told m wife, ' I 'm looking. I love you. I 'm going to be with you for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she is leaving. You will be here. ' @!GIFFORD: Oh, oh. @!Mr-NICE: I 'm never going to see her again. @!Mr-LEVY: It 's worked for 14 years? @!Mr-NICE: I 'm never going to see her again, so I 'm looking. @!KOTB: All right, Jim. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. But if you look too long you 'll be leaving. @!KOTB: Yes. We 're going to take a little commercial break, boys, and we 're going to be back with our man panel after your local news. @!GIFFORD: This is so riveting. @(Kotb-yawns) *** @!KOTB: And we 're back again with our man panel. David Good, Chuck Nice, Rick Younger, Joe Levy and more of GUYS TELL ALL. OK... @!GIFFORD: And more questions. @!KOTB: Yes. Back across the street to Miss Sara. @!HAINES: OK. I 'm here with Bobbie from Boise. @!KOTB: Uh-huh. @!GIFFORD: Bobbie from Boise. @!HAINES: And she 's got a question about communication. @!KOTB: Is n't that cute? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer. @!KOTB: Anyway. @!BOBBIE: My question is, why do men like to -- from your perspective -- do texting instead of calling personally on a phone to ask a woman out or to even anything. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!BOBBIE: To go to texting instead of the phone call. @!KOTB: @(Unintelligible) @!Mr-LEVY: This is -- this is -- this is so simple. Men are lazy. Men are lazy. It 's easier. It 's... @!GIFFORD: But would n't you rather hear a woman 's voice? @!KOTB: Do n't -- are n't you intrigued by... @!Mr-LEVY: Only if I know exactly what she 's saying and she 's saying exactly what I want. @!Mr-GOOD: It 's easier. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Me, personally, I prefer -- I prefer the telephone. @!Mr-GOOD: You can think about what you 're going to say to a woman. @!KOTB: What do you think? What do you think? @!Mr-YOUNGER: It 's like... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!Mr-YOUNGER:... you know, you spend so much time and then you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Mr-YOUNGER: So I like to talk. @!KOTB: You pick up. @!Mr-YOUNGER: But I think also that might be a generational thing as well. @!Mr-NICE: Yeah, it is. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!Mr-GOOD: I enjoy texting. I like texting. It 's easy. You can do it on your own time, think about what you want to say. @!Mr-NICE: Good. @!KOTB: But would you ask a girl out on a text? @!Mr-GOOD: Oh no. I 'd never ask her out by text. @!Mr-NICE: No, you 're not going to ask them out in a text. @!Mr-GOOD: No. @!KOTB: OK. @!Mr-NICE: But I would rather communicate through texting. @!Mr-GOOD: But once you 're in there -- yeah. @!GIFFORD: Because you are married. @!Mr-NICE: Right. And that means I can control how much you talk because I am texting. So you know, I do n't want to call you because then 25 minutes later I 'm still on the phone going, yeah, yeah, OK, all right, oh, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are geared. Guys do n't sit here -- we wo n't sit here and have a conversation like girls do and we 're up in there like this. @!Mr-NICE: Well, if you did it like that I would. @!KOTB: Here is Jennifer. OK. Here 's her question. " My man thinks that showing affection makes him whipped and makes him look weak in front of his buddies, but very loveable behind closed doors. What 's the deal? " So he 's too different guys, one in front of his friends and one at home. @!Mr-NICE: Oh, he 's immature. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Yeah. @!Mr-NICE: What a -- what a little pup he is, how cute. How cute is that? You 've got to be tough in front of your buddies. @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: Trying to impress the guys. @!Mr-NICE: You 've got to impress the guys. Ah. Go, what 's up. @!GIFFORD: So a man who 's in love wo n't care who 's around? @!Mr-NICE: No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that I was not going to have sex with my friends. @!Mr-GOOD: Know who you 're going home with, exactly. @!KOTB: All right. Let 's go back across to Sara. Hey, Sara. @!HAINES: Oh, is it me? We 've got Cheryl from Nashville with a question about gifts. @!CHERYL: Hi. I 'd like to know if you think it 's inappropriate for a spouse to volunteer their wish list? @!Mr-NICE: What do you mean volunteer? @!Mr-LEVY: Oh, no, no, no, no. @!Mr-NICE: Do you mean tell your husband what you want? @!CHERYL: Yes. @!Mr-NICE: Oh, I love you. Thank you. @!Mr-YOUNGER: No, I want to know. Yes. @!Mr-NICE: Thank you. Thank you so much. @!Mr-GOOD: We 're not mind readers. @!Mr-LEVY: Yes. @!Mr-NICE: You mean I do n't have to guess or actually do some detective work to figure out what the hell you want? Thank you. @!Mr-YOUNGER: I want to get it right, so please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want because, you know. @!Mr-LEVY: And the thing is that most men are terrible at paying attention. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!Mr-LEVY: Women tell you what they want all the time. @!GIFFORD: Does your wife tell you? Does she tell what you want -- what she wants? @!Mr-LEVY: Men are not listening. No. I actually pay attention. I pay attention and I check her Web browsing history. And then I know exactly to buy her. @!GIFFORD: You check her Web browsing history? @!Mr-LEVY: No, I don't. @!Mr-NICE: He 's getting her sex toys. @!GIFFORD: Oh, boy. @!KOTB: All right. Here 's the question from Shereen. " How do I get my husband to willingly help out around the house and with our toddler? " @!GIFFORD: Operative word, mm-hmm. @!KOTB: " If I ask, he does n't do it. If I wait, it never gets done. I wind up doing it all myself and quite frankly, I 'm tired. Help! " @!Mr-YOUNGER: I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up one morning and go. Leave the baby, go. Say this is your child, you take care of him. You -- trust me, you 'll figure out a way to keep him alive until I get back home. @!GIFFORD: And keep it clean, yeah. @!Mr-NICE: I 'm going to say, he might be alive, but he might be laying in his own filth. @!Mr-YOUNGER: Oh, but no, see, what he needs is a day to realize just how hard it is to do what she does. @!KOTB: Hard she works, yeah. @!GIFFORD: If he 's a nasty selfish guy, he 's just going to resent that she got up and left, it 's not going to teach him anything. She married the wrong guy. @!Mr-NICE: Yeah. All right. But then maybe she needs to take the whole family and leave and never come back. I do n't know. But I 'm just saying. It 's like I 'm hoping -- I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizes what she goes through... @!KOTB: Yeah. Yeah. @!Mr-NICE:... that he will be willing to do something. @!GIFFORD: He might be -- yeah. @!Mr-LEVY: And men need a reward system. Whatever it is he likes, emphasize it. I do n't care if it 's doughnuts or affection, say I need you to take care of the baby. There 's a doughnut on the other end. @!GIFFORD: Oh, wow. @!Mr-NICE: Doughnuts of affection. Heart-shaped doughnuts, yeah. @!KOTB: Chuck Nice... @!GIFFORD: That 's disturbing on a lot of levels. @!KOTB: Thank you, kids. @!GIFFORD: Love you guys, you guys are awesome. @!KOTB: Thank you. All right, coming... @!GIFFORD: Immature, but awesome. @!KOTB: Coming up next, we 're going to have our latest inductee into the JOY FIT CLUB. He lost over 100 -- 340 pounds. @!GIFFORD: Oh my gosh. @!KOTB: Wow. @!GIFFORD: That might be the most ever. Wow. Is that true or is that a misprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
