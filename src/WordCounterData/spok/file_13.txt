221741 TWA REMEMBERED @!DAN-RATHER-host : It happened six months ago tomorrow, thousands of lives changed forever with the crash of TWA Flight 800. Today, for the first time in months, reporters got a glimpse of the hangar where investigators are painstakingly rebuilding what 's left of the 747, still searching for clues to the crash. As for friends and loved ones left behind, of course they ca n't forget, but they also ca n't forget the future. @(Footage-of-wedding) @!Ms-JUDY-STORY-@1Wi : You look gorgeous. @!GILLIAN : I wish I could give you a hug... @!Ms-STORY : I know. @!GILLIAN :... but I know I 'll step on my dress. @!Ms-STORY : No, that 's all right. And those are her grandma 's earrings. @!GILLIAN : Yep. @!Ms-STORY : Are n't they beautiful? Are n't they beautiful on you? Bill Story and I had expected to live our whole life together. @!GILLIAN : I 'm really getting married. @!Ms-STORY : You are. We fully expected to live at least 30 years happily married. This is such a happy time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of B -- life with him... @(Photo-of-Bill-and-) @!Ms-STORY :( Voiceover)... has made me feel that I 've been cheated. This is one of my favorite pictures of Bill. He was up in Alaska. @(Footage-of-Judy-ho) @!Ms-STORY :( Voiceover) He was n't supposed to be on Flight 800. He missed the flight that he was supposed to be on. qwq @( Footage-of-searche Unidentified Man 1 :( Voiceover)... body recovery right now...

Unidentified Man 3 :( Voiceover) What do you have there, Bob? Unidentified Man 4 :( Voiceover) He 's got a body in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marine operator, was one of many volunteers to respond to calls for help. @!Mr-LANEER : I do n't think anybody will ever forget the frustration that all of us felt not being able to find a survivor. After all, I think that 's what all of us went out there for. @!Mr-NEIL-TURNER : I did n't hesitate at all. @(From-crash-site) Looks like the back of a weight. @(Footage-of-Neil-Tu) @!RATHER :( Voiceover) Neil Turner, a college student home for summer vacation, also responded. @!Mr-TURNER : It was a lot more devastating than what I thought it would be. @(Footage-of-floatin) @!Mr-TURNER :( Voiceover) So we were just trying to put everything on a boat that looked like it was on its way down. @(From-crash-site) We towed this other piece that was sinking over to a -- a troller that -- three bodies on it. My thought was that these people are -- are -- have families and they 're out in the ocean. @(Footage-of-rescue-) @!Mr-TURNER :( Voiceover) And they should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is when Bill and I were married. @!RATHER :( Voiceover) Judy and Bill Story met and fell in love seven years ago. @!Ms-STORY : We realized how precious life was because we both lost our spouses previously. @(Footage-of-Judy-St) @!Ms-STORY :( Voiceover) I was really lucky because Bill had no children and he absolutely adored my two girls. And now it 's my own daughter and Bill 's stepdaughter that 's getting married herself. So far so good. @!GILLIAN : So far so good. @!Ms-STORY : Just do n't have me trip you down the aisle. I 'm s -- stepping in. I 'm the father of the bride and the mother of the bride today. @(Footage-of-wedding) @!Ms-STORY :( Voiceover) Gillian 's father would be extremely proud of her today. He was extremely excited about his number-one daughter getting married. She was truly troubled by his death and -- and -- and very emotionally upset for a long time. @(Footage-of-rescue-) @!Mr-LANEER : I spent some time in Vietnam and saw some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but maybe opened your eyes. @!Mr-TURNER : It comes to mind basically when I 'm alone and when I 'm not surrounded by people. I 'll think about it and I 'll try to push it out of my head because there 's no one really you can talk to about it because there 's no one really who understands what it -- what it was like. @(Footage-of-boat-be) @!RATHER :( Voiceover) Badly shaken, their boat disabled during the night, Turner and his brother had Laneer tow them to shore the next morning. @!Mr-TURNER : If could I take back that night, I would. I would n't have gone out there. @(From-crash-site) I -- I ca n't re... @(Footage-of-Turner) @!Mr-LANEER : Being out there that night and seeing 230 some odd people just destroyed in a flash is something, I guess, you do n't forget. @(Footage-of-Turner-) @!Mr-LANEER :( Voiceover) You learn to live with it. You learn to understand it. You never accept it. @(Footage-of-grievin) @!Mr-LANEER :( Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family. I hope they realize that the people that did go out there that night tried to do everything they possibly could. I hope they realize that we grieve along with them. And I hope that they can go on with their lives. @(Footage-of-wedding) @!RATHER :( Voiceover) At his daughter 's wedding, reminders not so much of the way Bill Story died, but of the way he lived. @!GILLIAN : Bill Story was such an amazing man. I just want you guys to know that we are remembering him and we are honoring him and missing him very much tonight.
