225241 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : Segment One this morning : the buzz inside and outside Washington over two primaries and a behind the scenes book. The new book is raising eyebrows with its peek inside the Clinton White House. At the same time, there 's quite a bit of Republican heartburn over the Senate nomination of Oliver North in Virginia. And in California today, it 's primary day in the Golden State 's closely watched governor 's race. Joining us from our Washington bureau to talk about all this and more are our political pundits, Democratic analyst Bob Beckel and Fred Barnes of The New Republic. Good morning. Nice to see you two again. @!Mr-BOB-BECKEL-@1De : Good morning, Paula. @!Mr-FRED-BARNES-@1P : Hi -- hi, Paula. @!ZAHN : I actually wanted to sta -- start someplace else, and that is talking about the president 's European trip. Fred, President Clinton had a lot to prove to world leaders and to veterans on this trip. How did he do? @!Mr-BARNES : Well, it was a start, you know. His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Bob Packwood giving a series of speeches on Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. But -- but -- but under the circumstances, I -- I think he did very well. He still needs to give the mea culpa speech, the speech where he really wraps it altogether and -- and tells the military -- and not just in an interview with Harry -- that -- that he really -- really means it when he says he loves the military. @!ZAHN : Well, le -- let 's talk about what the president tried to spell out in -- in various interviews that he conducted yesterday, Bob. He seemed to want to talk about his lack of service in Vietnam. Were any of his explanations satisfactory? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, Paula, I think they could have gone a little further. But first of all, that was a cheap shot worthy of me, by the way. @!Mr-BARNES : I -- I was going to say... @!Mr-BECKEL : That shot that you just gave... @!ZAHN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's something I would say. You 're supposed to be the conservative one here. No, I -- Paula, I think he -- he made an effort to try to go back and explain Vietnam, and I do n't think the way you do it is say ' I wish I could have served. ' I wish he had said that ' I probably made a mistake. ' @!Mr-BARNES : Exactly. @!Mr-BECKEL : ' I did n't -- still did n't agree with the war, but I 'm sorry I did what I did. Let 's try to put that behind us. ' And I think that everybody would have forgiven him. As it is, I do n't think the explanation was good enough, but I will say this. He went to Normandy, had a l -- big burden on his shoulders. I thought he did a terrific job in every way and came through the thing much better, and I 'll tell you, the people at the White House were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course, all this was happening at a time that Bob Woodward 's new book is out, which is a -- a blistering book on the inner workings of the Clinton administration. @(Close-up-of-the-bo) @!ZAHN : Bob, how damaging is it to have such a well-documented book showing such chaos, tension and indecision mas -- basically coming from the president within the administration? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, I guess the saddest part about that, Paula, is it does n't come as a big surprise to a lot of people. @!Mr-BARNES : It sure doesn't. @!Mr-BECKEL : But I -- but it was interesting. I was at an event last night with some White House people, and everybody was saying, ' I did n't say it. I did n't say it. Did you say it? No, I did n't say it. ' Woodward did a very good job. @!Mr-BARNES : Yeah. @!Mr-BECKEL : I 'll tell you the problem with it, though, is it does underscore a problem of decision-making that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to find right after the elections that there 's going to be a major change in the White House from every level. And I think that book, if anything else, sort of brought it all together in one place, underscoring the problems, and frankly, a lot of that still gets back to Bill Clinton himself. @!ZAHN : Fred, we have heard stories about the chaos within the White House now for months and months and months. What does it tell you that so many low-level staffers and high-ranking officials in the administration spoke on record to Bob Woodward? @!Mr-BARNES : Well, it tells me that, in -- in one sense, it 's business as usual. You know, it 's -- it 's always been a joy to me covering the White House because so many people like to yap at -- at every level. It 's not just the fifth-level staffers either. Now I... @!ZAHN : You 're talking about George Stephanopoulos talking very candidly about the president 's shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't talked quite that candidly to me, but he has on some occasions been very candid. Look, Bob Woodward is a very talented reporter, and he can get people to say things that others ca n't, and they somehow think that because it 's going to be in a book a year from now that somehow it 's not going to be in print, but -- but here it is. And it does really show the one thing -- and Bob mentioned it -- and it -- and there 's a policy -- a problem making decisions at the White House. President Clinton makes a decision, but then he does n't stick with it. I mean, the de -- the decisions are un -- made and unmade, and i -- and -- and everything is always an open question. @!ZAHN : Want to move on to California primary right now. Kathleen Brown, of course, Bob Beckel, wants to be the next governor of California. She is expected to win the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think she can win in November. I know that the Wilson people are bragging because they 've got a poll showing him ahead of her, but keep in mind, she 's been taking a beating now in this primary by her opponents. It 's not surprising that she would be down a little bit against Wilson. I think she 's going to come out of this in a strong way. Wilson has hit his peak. And I do n't care how many ways you cut it, Wilson has not been a good governor. He is a bad candidate, and he pretends to be a conservative, and he 's not. @!ZAHN : Fred, every -- you know, the Republicans... @!Mr-BECKEL : And Fred Barnes -- Fred Barnes loves him. Why do you like this guy so much? @!ZAHN :... they 're calling him the Comeback Kid. @!Mr-BECKEL : He 's dull, unimaginative and lackluster. @!Mr-BARNES : He 's a very good candidate. @!Mr-BECKEL : He 's dull, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Bob, my advice is never underestimate Pete Wilson. This guy is a great... @!ZAHN : Di -- people are saying he could be a presidential candidate. @!Mr-BECKEL : Oh, co... @!Mr-BARNES : If he wins, automatically. If he wins the governorship in California... @!Mr-BECKEL : Oh, get out of here! @!Mr-BARNES : Bob, if Kathleen Brown wins, you 'll be calling her a presidential candidate. @!Mr-BECKEL : This guy speaks -- this guy speaks -- this guy speaks, and Sominex sales plummet, I 'm telling you. @!Mr-BARNES : Oh, look, Bob, he -- you 're mad because he 's got the two big issues in California. He 's ahead of her on -- one is -- is illegal immigration and the other one is crime. @!Mr-BECKEL : Yeah, I notice he... @!Mr-BARNES : And those are helping him. @!Mr-BECKEL :... I notice he discovered both of thos... @!ZAHN : OK, you know what? I 'm going to give you 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us what 's going to happen in Virginia. Oliver North, what 's going to happen to him? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, the ques -- first of all, i -- for the Democrats, it underscores two things. One, the Christian right is now in charge of the Republican Party, at least there and in other places. @!Mr-BARNES : Oh, Bob. @!Mr-BECKEL : Secondly, that Ollie North will become the Jesse Jackson of the Republican Party. And three, if he gets elected -- and he could -- will you believe him when he swears to uphold the Constitution of the United States? That 's my question. @!Mr-BARNES : I -- I do n't think the Keating Five will have any trouble with Ollie North in the Senate. They can allow him to be th -- the interesting thing about this race... @!ZAHN : Fred, you have five seconds. @!Mr-BARNES :... that any of the four people who are going to be -- any of the four could win. @!ZAHN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much. @!Mr-BARNES : Bye-bye. @!ZAHN : We 're moving up on 16 minutes past the hour. Harry? @!HARRY-SMITH-@1Co-h : Thanks very much, Paula. And coming up next from Paris, well, the French go to bat for their troubled economy, but they 're finding out the rest of the world is playing hardball. And still ahead on CBS THIS MORNING, Ambassador Pamela Harriman takes us on a truly grand tour. And Dr. Howard Torman on a noisy and serious sleep disorder. And we 'll talk to Tom Arnold about the real-life drama between him and Roseanne.
