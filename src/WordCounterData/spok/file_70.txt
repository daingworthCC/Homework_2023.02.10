232141 SUSAN @!MOLINARI, co-host : Did you know that that mess in your medicine cabinet and the clutter in your closet could keep you from getting a promotion? Just ask a personal coach. @!Ms-TALANE-MIEDANE- : Hi, it 's Talane. @!MOLINARI : As a personal coach, Talane Miedane earns $ 200 an hour giving clients advice like this. @!Ms-MIEDANE : So then you have just a blitz week, where you say for -- for one hour a day, for the next week, I will spend time just organizing my office. @!MOLINARI : And this. @!Ms-MIEDANE : If your boss comes up on -- behind you on your -- while you 're typing into the computer, instead of trying to cover up the computer and protect your privacy, instead share more information, get them more involved than they ever wanted to be involved and believe me they 'll be leaving your alone. @!MOLINARI : And she told another client, Keith Gittens, to get rid of everything he 's been putting up with. Miedane believes that in order to achieve clarity in our lives, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets. @!Mr-KEITH-GITTENS-@ : And here 's a suitcase I do n't even use, can not lock. It 's tattered and torn, and I still keep it. Also, there 's a pair of shorts that I have n't worn since 1991, or another thing I 've been tolerating is a button here that 's missing on my coat since August and I 've got the button, too. It 's right here. Look at this. @!MOLINARI : And their sessions are starting to pay off. @!Mr-GITTENS : I used to do my personal training on a schedule that looks like this, just a piece of paper. I showed it to my coach and she said, ' J -- that wo n't do. ' So this paper turned into this. Now I use a Franklin planner. It 's really great because right now what I do is I schedule time for myself, which I never did before, and I also schedule time for my girlfriend. @!MOLINARI : And Keith and Talane have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORNING. @!Mr-GITTENS : Thank you. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Well, hello. @!MOLINARI : Let met ask you, Talane, there are more than 3,000 personal coaches in this country today. Sun Microsystems spends hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal coaches. The head of John Hancock and other CEOs are now starting to use personal coaches. It is obviously becoming a big business industry in the United States. What is a personal coach? @!Ms-MIEDANE : A personal coach is a trained professional who will help you reach your goals, whether they 're personal or business goals, in record time. @!MOLINARI : OK. You say that. When we watched what happened to Keith when you went into his house, it seemed like you were almost just giving him permission to do the things he knew he had to do in the first place. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Yeah. A lot of that is. You are giving people permission to do things they really want to do. Like one of my client is a senior executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a massage everyday. I heard Bob Hope does that. ' @!MOLINARI : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-MIEDANE : I say, ' By all means, go ahead. Your assignment this week is to get a daily massage. ' @!MOLINARI : And so part of your job is to get rid of our guilty conscious to do what 's good for ourselves. @!Ms-MIEDANE : That 's right. @!MOLINARI : But you do other things, too. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Well, a lot of times people do n't know what they really want to do with their lives. A lot of people hire me because they 're in a job that they 're frustrated with or they 're stuck and they do n't know what the right thing for them to do is. So sometimes they do n't know what they want to do. @!MOLINARI : But you are not a psychologist. If there 's a problem that 's going on there, some critics have said that the personal coaches ca n't deal with the emotional problems that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place. @!Ms-MIEDANE : That 's right. I 'm not a psychologist. Coaches are not trained or licensed to do therapy. And I 'm not interested in doing that. We work with people who are already healthy and successful and taking them up to the next level. If you have unresolved issues from the past, you 're much better off with a therapist. @!MOLINARI : OK. Now bringing us to someone who has gotten their life together in the future is Keith. Keith, what made you think, you know, one day, ' I 'm going to call a personal coach '? @!Mr-GITTENS : Well, I was going through a transition in my job. I was working in the financial industry... @!MOLINARI : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-GITTENS :... and I wanted to go into health and fitness. And when I got there, I had no idea how to get clients as a personal fitness trainer. So I went to a seminar and I met Talane and she said she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she helped you? @!Mr-GITTENS : Oh, it 's been tremendous. I went from three clients and now I have about 22 clients in about three months. @!MOLINARI : OK. But what we saw in -- in your house, the -- the closet that looks a lot like mine. Sewing buttons on... @!Mr-GITTENS : Mm-hmm. @!MOLINARI :... but you knew where they were. I never know where I put those buttons. You knew you had to do those things all along anyway. How did Talane get -- help you focus on getting these things done? @!Mr-GITTENS : Y -- d -- she said that there were certain issues that I may have -- you know, like if you have a cluttered closet, it might mean you have a cluttered brain, you know? @!MOLINARI : Uh-oh. Then I 'm in big trouble here, ladies and gentlemen. So you needed Talane to come in and tell you to clean your closet? I mean, this is, I think, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I do n't need to pay somebody all that money to tell me to do -- cleaning and -- and sewing buttons on. ' How did that help you? @!Mr-GITTENS : I -- I never looked at it as I 'm cleaning my closets in order to -- to do other things. But I found out wh -- with Talane, some of the things that she told me just helped me in every day situations in my life. So by cleaning out the closets was just one thing and it just lead to other things and other things and, you know, commitments, you know, being honest, certain things like that. @!MOLINARI : Right. Talane, how does this all work? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Well, basically, anything that you 're tolerating or putting up with, all those little things, that drains your energy and it prevents you from getting on with the big goals that you have in life. So that 's why it 's important. Get rid of those. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK. @!Ms-MIEDANE :... assignment. @!MOLINARI : And what comes in the second week then. @!Ms-MIEDANE : The second week you 're -- you 'll be working on your bigger goals, the things that you want to have. That frees up your energy, then you start to work on what you really... @!MOLINARI : So what we saw was just sort of the practice run going on here. @!Ms-MIEDANE : That 's the first assignment I give before I even have my first scheduled call with a brand-new client. @!MOLINARI : OK. And then after that, you go to another level? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Action -- yeah, it 's very action oriented. You work on your goals and every week you report back in on how you 're doing against your goals. @!MOLINARI : OK. Now you 've got some goals for all of us. I, myself, said just this morning I had no New Year 's resolutions. You 've got some for us. @!Ms-MIEDANE : We sure do. @!MOLINARI : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the first thing I 'd recommend that everybody do is get rid of everything in your life that you 're tolerating. All those little buttons, sew them on. Take a blitz day. Take a Saturday afternoon or Saturday morning, set aside a -- set around a time, say, from 10 to 11, blitz through as many things as you can on your list. Most people tolerate anywhere from 60 to 100 things in their life. @!MOLINARI : Like what? Give me a couple of examples. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Well, you 've got the missing buttons. @!MOLINARI : What am I tolerating? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Maybe the refrigerator light is out in your refrigerator. The venetian blinds that do n't go up and down very smoothly anymore. Or maybe you 're tolerating something about your boss -- a boss who micromanages you. Or maybe you 're tolerating that you do n't have enough money or credit card debt. @!MOLINARI : OK. @!Ms-MIEDANE : So there 's all sorts of things that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City, you know? All these things you can put on the list. When you start to add it up, it 's a lot. @!MOLINARI : And then what do I do? Move? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Yeah. Well, some people do. @!MOLINARI : Yeah, I guess so. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Yeah. Some p -- some of my clients have moved out of New York into other -- other states. @!MOLINARI : Well, come on back. We 're doing great here. All right. What 's number two? What 's our number two resolution? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Dump any goals that you have that over a year old. @!MOLINARI : I love that. I think that is such a great idea. So if it 's on your list for the last 20 years to lose weight... @!Ms-MIEDANE : Start exercising, forget it. Of course, we should n't say that with Keith here. @!MOLINARI : I know. Hire a personal trainer instead. OK. @!Ms-MIEDANE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- if you ca n't take action on it for yourself, give yourself a break, just forget it. Be the weight that you are, stop exercising or hire a trainer, hire a nutritionist. Get somebody else to do that goal for you. @!MOLINARI : OK. Number three. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Put in place a daily pleasure, something that you 'd have to look forward to every day. It could be something as simple as a hot bath with a glass of wine... @!MOLINARI : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-MIEDANE :... maybe you call a friend after work and chat for a bit but every day have something to look forward to. @!MOLINARI : All right. Number four. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Throw out anything that you have n't used in the last year. I had a client who goes to... @!MOLINARI : Like those lovely purple shorts of yours...( unintelligible). @!Mr-GITTENS : Thanks. @!Ms-MIEDANE : The purple shorts, the suitcase. @!Mr-GITTENS : Yeah. @!Ms-MIEDANE : One of my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd had that there for, you know, seven years. @!MOLINARI : OK. Well, those are some great resolutions. I 'm going to start working on that. Thank you both very much for being with us. @!Mr-GITTENS : Thanks. @!MOLINARI : Russ. @!Mr-GITTENS : You 're welcome. @!RUSS-MITCHELL-@1Co : Thank you, Susan. And just head this Saturday morning, we have a hot Latin recipe from this week 's Chef on a Shoestring. It 's quick, it 's easy and it 's pretty tasty, too. Now we 're going to take a break for some of our local stations. But for the rest of you, we 'll be right back, so do n't you go away. @(Logo-shown-theme-) @!MOLINARI : And Keith and Talane have done so well in organizing their life, they can even spend a few more minutes with us. We got down to a few more on our New Year 's resolution list. What 's next? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Next thing is to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself to do. @!MOLINARI : Like what? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Like the scuba lessons that you 've always wanted to take, tango classes, guitar lessons that you say, ' Some day when I have more time and more money, I 'll do it. ' @!MOLINARI : Hmm. @!Ms-MIEDANE : This year, do it. @!MOLINARI : OK. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Do n't wait another year. @!MOLINARI : All right. Good. What else? @!Ms-MIEDANE : Simplify your life. Do one thing this year that will permanently simplify your life. Sign up for automatic savings at your bank so you do n't have to do that every month. Hire a housekeeper so -- you know, do something this year that will permanently simplify your life for the rest of the year. @!MOLINARI : It sounds like a lot of these resolutions are things that we know we want to do, like simplifying your life, but we think that it 's just too big a project so we avoid it. And what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually get down to it. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Yes. Yeah. And you... @!MOLINARI : Pick one thing to do instead of 100 what you ca n't do. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Exactly. And we work on things one step at a time, one week at a time. And you 'd be amazed at how much you get done. @!MOLINARI : So you alleviate our guilty conscious and you also are, like, the protective mother over us, poking us, making sure we get it done. @!Ms-MIEDANE : Yes. If every week you had somebody to talk to about your goals, you 'd probably get a lot done. @!MOLINARI : Wow, that 's... @!Ms-MIEDANE : Not that you do n't accomplish a lot. @!MOLINARI : Well, no, that 's OK. We can always do more. Keith, you glad you did it? Are you going to recommend it to friends? @!Mr-GITTENS : Oh, absolutely. Sure. @!MOLINARI : Made a big difference in your life? @!Mr-GITTENS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H -- did you start a personal coach with you when you-all started this? @!Ms-MIEDANE : I certainly did. It has changed my entire life. I now do what I love to do every single day. Ca n't imagine anything more fun than coaching. @!MOLINARI : Well, that 's great. Thank you both very much for being with us. You 've given us some great suggestions for the new year, and good luck to you and your personal training and to you in your personal coaching. We 'll be right back with CBS SATURDAY MORNING. Stay with us. @(Announcements)
