4171841 @!JAMIE-YUCCAS# The city 's mayor tells CBS THIS MORNING three suspects are in custody and a fourth suspect is dead. We are now awaiting a news conference in Dallas with the city 's mayor and police chief. We will bring that to you live as it happens in a special report. @!JEFF-GLOR# As we wait for that, former chief Washington correspondent and FACE THE NATION moderator Bob Schieffer, he 's from Texas, grew up there. He started as a reporter there more than half a century ago. Bob, is now a CBS News contributor, he is in Washington. Bob it is -- it is good to see you. I know but we 're still waiting for a lot of information here, Bob. As -- as you know, we 'll go to this report when it happens. But what -- what do you make of what you 've seen so far? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER-( CBS# Well, what the mayor is going to say in this news conference is going to be very, very important, because what 's happened here, Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we -- we have been talking about. This was not a random act by some deranged person. This was a carefully planned military-style operation. This was a classic ambush where the ambushers put their shooters on the high ground, surrounded a certain place and then let their prey walk into their line of fire. They were also very good shots. These were people that knew how to use these weapons. We know that by the -- by the accuracy, by the number of police officers that were shot. They were, obviously, shooting at police. They were not shooting at the protesters. And they were successful, obviously. Twelve people were shot, five police officers are dead. The question now is who are these people? Is this some kind of organized group? Could it be terrorists? The Dallas mayor has said already this morning that he is not ruling out anything as to what the motive is or how these -- who these people are. So as we begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what their motivation was. This may be tied to some of the police shootings we have been seeing around the country. It may be something entirely different. Those are the things that we -- we will hope to find out more about when the Dallas officials hold this news conference. @!JAMIE-YUCCAS# Yeah, we 've been going on hours now. Still do n't have a ton of information, Bob. But I -- I want to ask you, because you provide such great perspective, covering so many events over the last sixty years -- the civil rights movement, JFK 's assassination, Vietnam. Can you put into context the type of divisiveness we 're seeing in this country and the rhetoric we 're seeing? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER# Well, one thing that we overlook, Jamie, is our culture is changing. I do n't think there 's any question about that. We are becoming a less patient society. We are becoming a more demanding society. For want of a better word, we are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road rage, in the way we treat one another. There 's just almost people -- nobody is satisfied with anything now. People are dissatisfied, they are frustrated, and -- and they act out on these things. And when you put those who are deranged into the mix, and they have access to these very powerful weapons of war, it just makes the stakes even higher. There 's no excuse for the -- some of the police shootings that we -- we have been seeing. Police are shooting first and asking questions later. But on the other hand, you have to remember that the police are scared too of these weapons. @!JAMIE-YUCCAS# Right. @!BOB-SCHIEFFER# That is why they are on such a hair trigger now. It 's going to take great training and we 're going to have to have more of it for our police departments around the country. They are running thing. And Scott Pelley talked about this earlier. The Dallas Police Department is a very good police department. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community policing. The Mayor Mike Rawlings, I know him personally. He -- he is a very upstanding guy. He is very forward thinking. He enjoys very bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats in Dallas. It is somewhat ironic that this would happen in, of all places Dallas, where their police department has done such a good job. But, again, I go back to this. We do not yet know what the motivation of these shooters is. This may be something totally unrelated. Probably not, but it could be something totally unrelating -- unrelated to some of these police shootings that we have been seeing across the country. This might be the work of terrorists. We 're going to find out eventually, but right now, we simply do n't know. @!KRISTINE-JOHNSON# Until we do find out, Bob, the fact is that the anger in this country really does seem to be at a tipping point and that is a very, very scary feeling, I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to this news. Based on your experience, what do lawmakers need to do to finally turn this corner? @!BOB-SCHIEFFER# Well, nobody knows the answer to this because there are so many things that this is so complex. But you 're exactly right. We wake up each morning wondering what could happen today that is worse than what happened yesterday. I 'm now told that we are going now. The mayor is coming out. We are going now to that special report. Let 's go directly there. @!SCOTT-PELLEY# This is a CBS NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. I 'm Scott Pelley in Dallas where the mayor of Dallas and the police chief are holding a news conference. Let 's listen in. @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# -- determination to make our city safe and to arrest anybody that did us harm. I also want to thank the county, Judge Jenkins. I want to thank the FBI. I want to thank the governor, lieutenant governor flew in last night. The President called me from Poland. And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. And I want to say from our -- from our -- our heart we feel that. And so, thank you. I am now going to tell you some not good news for you reporters. And that is we 've got a criminal investigation going on. And our number one job is to make sure the citizens of Dallas are safe, so we 're not going to tell you anything about the suspects and we 're not going to answer any questions on that. We will, when it 's the right time. Now is not the right time. But a lot has happened in the last five or six, seven hours since we talked. it was early in the morning. And I want Chief Brown to -- to give you an update on that. I 'm proud of him. He has been working so hard these last few hours. We 've been with families and we 've been trying to make sure that the city is safe this morning. And I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, Mayor. We 're hurting. Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. All I know is that this, this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. To update you on what 's transpired since we last spoke, let me walk through the standoff that had occurred, that was occurring at El Centro on the second floor of the college there in downtown Dallas. We cornered one suspect and we tried to negotiate for several hours. Negotiations broke down. We had an exchange of gunfire with the suspect. We saw no other option, but to use our bomb -- bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was. Other options would have exposed our officers to great danger. The suspect is deceased, as a result of detonating the bomb. The reporting that the suspect killed himself is not accurate. We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bomb. Our hostage negotiator did an exceptional job getting this suspect to talk before he died during the hours of negotiating that eventually broke down. And I want to share with you some of the comments from this suspect. The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. The suspect stated he will eventually -- that we will eventually find the IEDs. The suspect stated he was not affiliated with any groups and he stated that he did this alone. The suspect said other things that are part of this investigation so that we can make sure that everyone associated with this tragic event is brought to justice. So, as the mayor said, we wo n't expand on any further on what other suspects we have interviewed or looked at their status until we get further into this investigation and get closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let me just say just some closing comments about Dallas police officers and DART police officers, some of the bravest men and women you 'd ever want to be associated with. You see video footage after video footage of them running toward gunfire from an elevated position with no chance to protect themselves, and to put themselves in harm 's way to make sure citizens can get to a place of security. So please join me in applauding these brave men and women who do this job under great scrutiny, under great vulnerability who literally risk their lives to protect our democracy. We do n't feel much support most days. Let 's not make today most days. Please, we need your support to be able to protect you from men like these who carried out this tragic, tragic event. Pray for these families. I spoke with the families of the deceased and the injured. They are not having a good time trying to deal, absorb this, trying to understand why. And they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us comfort the grieving officers ' families. And I 'll trust that soon because we 're working very diligently and processing the crime scene finding to find evidence to bring any other suspects to justice that were a part of this. But, please, pray for our strength through this trying time. Thank you. @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# I want to add that there are public safety officials that protect our cities and our institutions all across America every day that are n't police officers. And we lost one of those last night. A DART officer was one of the victims. And I want to just take a moment and say that professionalism of the DART organization was great. And I appreciate better school police officers, campus college police officers standing shoulder to shoulder with our police officers. And that 's the way we work. Chief Brown told the victims ' families last night and the police officers that he was a man of faith. And I am a man of faith, too. And that we need prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve o'clock at Thanks-Giving Square, a leadership group of inter faith ministers will be lead us -- leading us in that prayer. I would ask that if you 're at your home or at your office or at your school to join us today at noon and that spirit of prayer. To bring our city together and our country together to heal wounds, not create them. Thank you. Any -- any questions that were not off limit? Yeah. @!WOMAN-#1#( INDISTINCT). @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# Yeah. @!DAVID-BROWN# The injured officers have -- most of them have been released. There are some that will need follow up. I 'm not going to go into detail of -- of what types of injuries. Their families are being very private for obvious reasons right now. But, again -- excuse me, what 's the question? I 'm sorry. @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# Yeah, are they critical? @!WOMAN-#1#( INDISTINCT) critical? Are they doing( INDISTINCT)? @!DAVID-BROWN# Yes, they are doing better. Some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're still needing more treatment but they 're being very private about any further details about their health. @!MAN-#1#( INDISTINCT). Can you speak of that and the fact that something like this( INDISTINCT). @!DAVID-BROWN# So we have to be right a hundred percent of the time in the way we police this city. Suspects like this have to be right once, they do n't have to work very hard to do cowardly acts like this, to snipe at our officers from elevated positions and to ambush them. From secreted positions, around corners. All that hard work is not for naught. This city has shown great support for this police department. The mayor and council and city manager 's office have supported this department and these officers and we expect that to continue. And -- and this community, I 'm born and raised here. Dallas is a great city. Our officers will continue to put themselves in harm 's way to protect these great citizens. So, it 's worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for -- for -- if anybody has n't heard us say this. This police department trained in de-escalsh -- escalation far before cities across America did it. We 're one of the premier community policing cities in the country. And this year we have the fewest police officer-related shootings than any large city in America. So, we are working hard to improve and there 's always room for improvement. But we are best in class, we feel. @!MAN-#2#( INDISTINCT). But the people in Dallas watching at home right now( INDISTINCT). @!DAVID-BROWN# No, I 'm not going to be satisfied until we turn over every stone. We 've got some level that this one suspect did do some of the shooting, but we 're not satisfied that we 've exhausted every lead. And we 're not going to be satisfied until every lead is exhausted. So if there 's someone out there that was associated with this, we will find you. And we will prosecute you and we will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it total four suspects? @!DAVID-BROWN# We 're not counting or expanding on who or how many. We 're -- we 're going to keep these suspects guessing. @!WOMAN-#2# Chief, can you talk about the -- I know you 're first focused right now in( INDISTINCT), I heard your first focus right now( INDISTINCT) @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# Well, I -- I 'm going to let Chief Brown make any strategic decisions, but it 's important for citizens to realize that we want to give everybody their freedom of speech. We have been through several protests in the last five or six years. And they 've all gone in a safe manner. But the chief makes decisions at times that people could be critical of, de-escalated too much. You put too much body armor on. If we 're all being critical of those things, just think about today. This is what you 're risking, if you do n't do it right. And, so, from -- from a policy standpoint, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully and these were peaceful protests until this happened. But we also have to believe in keeping our police officers safe. And I know I 'm going to redouble my efforts on that. @!DAVID-BROWN# Again, I just want to expand on the mayor 's comments. The police officers is our guardians of this great democracy, the freedom to protest, the freedom of speech and the freedom for expression. All freedoms we fight for with our lives. It 's what -- it 's what makes us who we are as Americans. And so we risk our lives for those rights. And, so, we wo n't militarize our policing standards, but we will do it in a much safer way every time, like -- like we chose to do it this time. We had an adequate amount of officers at this scene. And we were blocking traffic and doing all the things to protect people 's right to protest and -- and their free speech. We are not going to let a coward who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to do it. Our city, our country is better than that. @!WOMAN-#3# Can you say at all whether this is someone who was having some mental stability problems and just looking for an opening to really act or is this something more organized. Can you talk about that? @!DAVID-BROWN# All of those questions would just be speculation to answer. We ca n't get into the head of a person that would do something like this. We negotiated with this person. They seemed lucid during the negotiation. He wanted to kill officers. And he expressed killing white people. He expressed killing white officers. He expressed anger for Black Lives Matter. None of that makes sense, none of that is a reason or a legitimate reason to do harm to anyone. So the rest of it would just be speculating on what his motivations were. We just know what he said -- that 's what he said to our negotiators. @!MIKE-RAWLINGS# Hey, guys, thank you. We still have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to take off. @!SCOTT-PELLEY# A news conference in Dallas with Mayor Mike Rawlings and the Police Chief David Brown. A number of important questions have been answered. The suspect was killed when the police put a bomb on a robot and drove the robot into the area where the suspect was holed up and detonated their bomb. The suspect spoke to the police for several hours, talked to a hostage negotiator for the police department and said that he was angry about the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of white police officers across the country. He was angry on behalf of the Black Lives Matter protest movement, and that he wanted to kill white people and he wanted to kill white police officers, in particular. Those were the details coming out of the Dallas news conference this morning. Our coverage will continue throughout the day on our streaming news service, CBSN and we 'll be right here for you on the CBS EVENING NEWS tonight. Until then, I 'm Scott Pelley, CBS @ @ @ @ @
