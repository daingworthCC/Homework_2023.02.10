4103441 @!MR-RICHARD-ENGEL: Thank you very much. Good to be here. @!MR-GREGORY: We ca n't wait to get your analysis. Thanks, Richard. @(Todd-touches-Engel @!MR-ENGEL: Hey, you wanted to touch me? @!MR-CHUCK-TODD: Just want to make sure you 're here. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah, he 's actually here. @!MR-TODD: I 've heard of you. @!MR-GREGORY: Editorial page editor for The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot is here ; presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin ; and last but not least, my hometown mayor -- and I just pronounced your name wrong, which is really embarrassing -- the mayor of Los Angeles. Antonio Villaraigosa, for his first appearance here on MEET THE PRESS. Villaraigosa was elected in May of 2005 after serving in the California State Assembly and at LA City Council. Now in his second term. He 'll be sworn in tomorrow as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Baltimore. In that role he will represent an organization of more than 1200 mayors and speak out on policy issues impacting cities across the country, and, indeed, some of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!MR-GREGORY: Welcome to everybody. Let 's talk politics. Let 's talk about the race for 2012 and the Republican field. Here is our, our board of who 's in right now. And a couple of notes you pay attention to there. Jon Huntsman is going to announce on Tuesday. And, of course, Michele Bachmann, who had a strong debate, has filed papers this past week to get into the race. She 'll be doing more of that this coming week. And this is how the field now looks, if you look at our latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal polling. Mitt Romney still on top, Sarah Palin, Herman Cain at 12 percent. And, excuse me, let 's just go back to that previous board if we can do it. I glossed over and I should n't have, because you 've got those who are undeclared or undecided. Palin is the perpetual one that we speculate about ; Giuliani ; Rick Perry creating a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And even John Bolton, who does n't think the Republicans are talking enough about foreign policy. You heard that debate just a moment ago with Lindsey Graham. So, Chuck Todd, there 's a lot on the table. Where are we at the end of this week on the Republican side? @!MR-TODD: Well, first I 'm going to stick with the baseball theme, and that is the focus, I think, is on the player to be named later at this point. Because of the people running right now, Mitt Romney is not just a front-runner. I think he 's a very solid front-runner when you look at all of the things that matter to being a front-runner right now, all of the candidates chasing him seem to be stepping on themselves. Tim Pawlenty had a particularly bad week. Michele Bachmann does n't seem as if she can get the nomination. You can see how she can get very, very strong, and in the end, the Mitt Romney folks love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the player to be named later, specifically Rick Perry, I think when you look at how this week played out, as good of a week as Mitt Romney had as being a front-runner, you 're seeing it in our own poll, you 're seeing it in other polls, Rick Perry had a pretty good week, too, because of two things. One, the Tim Pawlenty flubs. @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MR-TODD: And, and, two, the fact that there does seem to be this vacuum here of the anti-establishment wing of the party who 's not enthused about who 's all out there. @!MR-GREGORY: And we 'll come -- I want to unpack that Tim Pawlenty baggage in just a little bit. But, Paul Gigot, let me ask you this, Rick Perry, the buzz about Rick Perry, he spoke this weekend at a gathering of, of Republicans down in New Orleans. Here 's a portion of what he said. @(Videotape) @!GOV-RICK-PERRY: Let 's speak with pride about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elect more conservative Republicans. Let 's stop this American downward spiral. @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: Here 's a, here 's a Republican saying, " Let 's talk about social issues. Let 's talk about moral values. " He sees that there 's a space here for a social conservative candidate in the race. @!MR-PAUL-GIGOT: But his trump issue will be jobs. @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MR-GIGOT: I mean, there 's a, the Dallas Fed has recently had a, Federal Reserve recently had a study showing that Texas has created 40 percent, nearly 40 percent of all the new jobs since the recession ended. That 's going to be his big selling point if he gets in. Yes, he 's, he 's going to talk about the social issues, but there 's plenty of other candidates who are talking about that. I think if he gets in, he 'll say, " I 'm a governor. I 've been in for a decade. I 've accomplished a lot. The Texas economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So what 's going to happen is he 's, that 's the theme he 's going to make. The question I have for Perry is, is the country, and particularly those Northern suburbs, ready for another Texan after eight years of, of George... @!MR-GREGORY: It 's interesting... @!MR-GIGOT:... George W. Bush? @!MR-GREGORY:... Doris, if you look at the debate this week, some of the big headlines, we 'll put them on the screen, showed a theme. Focus on Obama and the economy, targeting the president at the debate, target Obama, hits the president on the economy, and on and on it goes. This was, let 's not disagree with each other. Let 's focus on the president 's performance on the economy. @!MS-DORIS-KEARNS-GO: And in a certain sense, that 's what Pawlenty got lambasted for because he was suppose to have taken on Romney on Obamacare. You know, I think some of these things, when we say at the beginning, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget how early it is. I remember, this time in ' 07, McCain was in the wilderness. His campaign was imploding. So we 've got a lot way to go. The problem with Pawlenty focusing on Obama and not focusing on Romney at that time was then you have to ask, if he could n't stand up to Romney, can he stand up to Obama? And you 're looking for that forcefulness. @!MR-GREGORY: Well, then let 's talk about Pawlenty for just a second because in the debate he decides not to take him on on health care in Massachusetts, which he had done in an interview. Then he came on Fox News this week and said, " Hey, I made a mistake. " Even said -- he called Romney a co-conspirator with President Obama on health care. This is what he said to Fox News. @(Videotape) @!Mr-TIM-PAWLENTY: I should have been much more clear during the debate, Sean. I do n't think we can have a nominee that was involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then continues to defend it. @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: May... @!MS-GOODWIN: You see, I think, though... @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah. @!MS-GOODWIN: I think the one thing Romney did well in that debate, he has an answer, finally, for the Obamacare thing by saying, " I did it in my state. There are problems in my state. He should have come and asked me what worked, what did n't work. " He was prepared for this in a way that he was n't prepared four years ago. It really helps to have run for the presidency once before. It 's a whole different planet. We were talking about planets before. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah. @!MS-GOODWIN: And he 's learned... @!MR-ENGEL: @(Unintelligible)... too. @!MS-GOODWIN: Exactly. @!MR-ENGEL: We were listening to the clip that you played earlier by Mitt Romney and he, there was one thing that jumped out at me that implied a specific lack of preparation. @!MS-GOODWIN: Oh, yes. @!MR-ENGEL: He -- you played a clip earlier and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a concept, I think, everyone would agree with. The problem is, the people are not called Afghanis. They 're called Afghans. So if you 're try, the Afghani is the currency. @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-ENGEL: So if you 're trying to talk about what the foreign policy should be for a foreign nation... @!MS-GOODWIN: He should learn the words. @!MR-ENGEL:... where we have troops... @!MR-GIGOT: He should at least... @!MR-ENGEL:... you should know what the people are called. @!MR-GREGORY: And I want to come back on this foreign policy points, but I want to hear from the mayor, as well. What is your take? I mean, here you are in a big Democratic state, in, in a city that is dealing all the major issues, from the economy to education reform. How do you see the way the debate is shaping up on the Republican side? @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Well, I think the term was used now twice, it feels like these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is America 's out of work, too many people have n't been able to get back into the workplace. We 're not doing enough to train those new workers. We 're cutting infrastructure and transportation. In America 's cities, we 're, we 're saying that America needs to focus at home again. And, and this issue of the war in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq is now an issue that 's front and center of debate in our cities. @!MR-GREGORY: Well, and you even talked about this in the gathering of mayors. We 'll put it on the screen. The New York Times reported on a resolution that you 're talking about : " Mayors See End of Wars as a Fix for Struggling Cities. When downturn-weary mayors from around the country gathered... Friday for the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors... they introduced a resolution calling for the speedy end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and calling on Congress to use $126 billion a year the wars cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here. @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Absolutely. You know, you have Democrats who do n't want to address entitlements and Medicare and Social Security. You have Republicans who say that defense spending is off the table. So what 's left? It 's infrastructure, it 's transportation, it 's education, it 's public health, it 's eviscerating Medicaid and the safety net. And, you know, we actually have to represent these people. We do n't live in the bubble of the Beltway. And I think for many of us, although we 're about 80 percent Democrat, we 're also very practical. And so the issue of pension reform is an issue that almost all of us have embraced. The issue of education reform, seniority and tenure, we 're tackling these tough issues. And so we find, and I find, that the debate right now among the Republicans is so out of touch with everyday people who live on Main Street. @!MR-GREGORY: Well, let me get an aspect of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is watching this campaign develop and this internal fight on the Republican side about Afghanistan, about the future of America -- America 's involvement in the rest of the world, whether it 's Libya or Afghanistan. There 's real war weariness here. @!MR-ENGEL: There, there certainly is. And I think that 's understandable. I mean, 10 years the U.S. has been engaged in two major land wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. But I think this debate about Libya, for example, I just came from Libya before I came here, and the fact of the matter is the war in Libya right now is not very serious, that NATO is not doing a terribly good job. The rebels need a lot more help. The bombing campaign in Tripoli barely exists. Every once in a while there 's a few bombs on mostly empty compounds, and people go about their lives more or less unaffected. It 's not the kind of thing that 's going to drive Khaddafy from power. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lead this, this fight, which -- and are, and are struggling to do it, are looking at this debate in -- within the -- in the United States to end the U.S. support for NATO. If the U.S. ended its support for NATO in Libya, NATO really is dead. And all of these European allies, particularly Italy, who supported the United States in Iraq, which they, they had no interest in, would say, " Well, why is n't the United States supporting us now in Libya? "... @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MR-ENGEL:... which is an important mission for Europe. @!MR-GREGORY: Paul, how do you see this debate within the Republican Party? I mean, Lindsey Graham could n't have been stronger, saying... @!MR-GIGOT: It 's... @!MR-GREGORY:... " Look, you 're going to start taking the president on the left on foreign policy? That 's not going to go well in the Republican Party. " @!MR-GIGOT: There 's war weariness, and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret to say this, there 's some real political opportunism here. I mean, you have a Democrat in the White House. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah. @!MR-GIGOT: This is not what Republicans would be saying -- most of them, nearly all of them -- if George W. Bush were still in the White House. So the question, I think, that -- fair to ask of a Michele Bachmann, who voted for the Dennis Kucinich resolution to cut off funds within 15 days for Libya, is if you 're, you 're, you 're running to be commander in chief, all right, do you really want as a candidate to invite Congress to micromanage and be able to cut off your use of force if you become president? That 's not a very thoughtful position. Yes, it is what Barack Obama did when he was a candidate, but now you can see it 's hurting him as he 's president. So I think there 's some real contradictions here on the -- from some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McCain-Lindsey Graham wing... @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MR-GIGOT:... and some of the more grassroots, and I would even say somewhat isolationist, elements of the Republican Party. @!MR-GREGORY: It 's interesting, Doris, though, on this question of leadership around the world, Robert Gates, he 's the departing secretary of Defense, he 's been giving interviews, and he gave one to Newsweek. And he 's been quite outspoken about his views, whether it 's about the wars or about how Congress is behaving. We 'll put a portion of it up on the screen, the interview that he gave, and it 's quite interesting. He said, " I 've spent my entire adult life with the United States as a superpower, and one that had no compunction about spending what it took to sustain that position.... It did n't have to look over its shoulder because our economy was so strong. This is a different time. " He says, " To tell you the truth, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's time " to retire, because frankly I ca n't imagine being part of a nation, part of a government... that 's being forced to dramatically scale back our engagement with the rest of the world.... Congress is all over the place... and the Republicans are a perfect example.... I think there is no consensus on a role on the world. " That 's a very interesting statement. @!MS-GOODWIN: Well, and it comes with such credibility because he 's conducted himself so incredibly well during his tenure as secretary. I mean, I think we are confused right now. I mean, I think the problem with Libya right now is we should be debating exactly what Richard said, what should we be doing there substantively? Instead, we 're debating president vs. Congress. @!MR-ENGEL: Who gets to call the shots. @!MS-GOODWIN: And who... @!MR-GREGORY: Right, the fight behind the fight. Right. @!MS-GOODWIN: And, and it 's always going to be a dispute. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The president 's the commander in chief, but Congress can declare war. So we 're going to have these fights forever. @!MR-ENGEL: I think you 're going to see more of them going forward because small wars, after this last decade... @!MS-GOODWIN: They become -- that 's right. @!MR-ENGEL:... are going to become the future. @!MS-GOODWIN: The really interesting thing is James Baker wrote... @!MR-ENGEL: Drone wars, little wars like Libya. @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MS-GOODWIN: James Baker wrote an editorial in The Washington Post because he was part of a commission that I was an historical adviser for, a war powers commission, arguing that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, it needs to be repealed. What we need to replace it with is a war consultation act where, before you go to one of these things, you go to the Congress. You should go to the Congress. It helps you to communicate to the country. But if it 's something like bin Laden, you do n't because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do it afterwards. @!MR-GREGORY: Well, part of it 's about, again, what are we doing? What 's, what 's, what -- if the rebels take power, what does that look like? And how long does Khaddafy stay? @!MR-TODD: Well, look, a couple things. One is, is, the one thing, that every president believes the War Powers Act is unconstitutional. @!MS-GOODWIN: Right. @!MR-TODD: And if you notice in the very ways they word these legal memos -- Bob Bauer, the current White House counsel, very specific about saying certain things are consistent with the idea of the War Powers Act, you know, because they do n't -- most presidents do n't want to acknowledge that -- the... @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-TODD: But let 's also talk about why this is also a problem. The president has done poor personal politics on selling Libya, period. OK? When you 've got Jim Webb out there, who would be a national security Democrat, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission. Dick Lugar, Republican, spend a little time with him, explain the mission. He 's not done the personal politics of this. Joe Biden usually -- it 's usually outsourced to Joe Biden, the way this White House works. He 's been in the middle of the debt negotiations and this whole debt commission. So I think, yes, you have Congress all over the place. Yes, there 's all these issues with, with the Republican Party inside Congress right now. And yes, I do think there 's some opportunism. But the president has n't made a good faith effort at just good, old-fashioned back-slapping politics. @!MR-GIGOT: And I would add, not only, not only within Congress, but to the American public. I mean, he does n't not want to talk about Afghanistan or Libya because I think they feel that the -- in the White House, he needs to focus only on domestic issues. There 's only downside on foreign policy. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you have to make the sale. @!MR-GREGORY: All right, I 'm going to take a break here. Couple things I want to do when we come back : talk about the final act in this Weiner scandal, more about the economy and how that is going to shape the debate for the presidency, and more about the Republican approach to it all. More from our roundtable right after this. @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY: We 're back now with more from our roundtable. Doris, a big story still this week, Anthony Weiner. He did finally resign. One of the questions that comes up is why it is some politicians can have sex scandals that they can survive and yet he could n't. What happened here? @!MS-GOODWIN: Well, I think a couple of things happened. One was the timing of it. For the Democrats, it was disastrous. They were just making a momentum on the fact that they had won the special election for yet another congressman who had to resign because of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he distracted them from that news. So they were putting pressure on him. Secondly, he lied to his colleagues, to the country, to the press. And thirdly, I think the saturation of the media today is such that he must 've felt like a mountain was falling on him. The only way to relieve that pressure was to get out. @!MR-GREGORY: And, Chuck, he just did n't have the support. I mean, he, he called Nancy Pelosi and said look at my polling. It 's still holding up in my district. She said, take that as a sign that you can bow out gracefully here. @!MR-TODD: Well, no. What it -- it 's a message to some of these members of Congress saying it 's good to have friends. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah. @!MR-TODD: And he found out he really did n't have any friends, and sort of the way he might butt into a press conference or do some things, clearly had irritated Nancy Pelosi over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. What I just did n't understand is why he thought having yet another press conference, going in front of the cameras one more time was a good idea. It seemed it only fed the worst parts of this scandal. You 're right about the media saturation. And by the way, I do n't think in this environment, anybody -- I do n't think David Vitter would 've survived... @!MS-GOODWIN: In this environment. @!MR-TODD:... in this environment. @!MS-GOODWIN: What 's sad about it, though, is we waste so much time in our political arena. @!MR-ENGEL: I was shocked by how much time is wasted on this kind of stuff... @!MS-GOODWIN: We took three weeks on Weiner. @!MR-ENGEL:... when I got back. @!MS-GOODWIN: They spent them three weeks... @!MR-ENGEL: Now I know why Osama bin Laden has his messages hand delivered. @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MS-GOODWIN: But I mean, three weeks on Weiner, three weeks on the birth certificate. We 've got serious problems, as you were saying. @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Yeah. @!MR-GREGORY: Mayor, let me turn to that. On the, on the economy specifically because, again, front line mayor, dealing with these problems. Here 's the cover of Newsweek, and it 's former President Clinton who, lo and behold, has a few things to say about the economy, " 14 Ways to Save America 's Jobs. " And " It 's Still the Economy, Stupid, it says inside. Can you make a case for Democratic governance given the economic woes of this country that have persisted under President Obama? @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Without question. But let me say something about the three weeks of scandal that you referred to. For most of us watching that circus and, and the amount of time and air it had consumed, it -- again, feels like you 're on another planet. People are losing their homes due to foreclosure. People are out of a job in, in double digit numbers. According to our metro economies report, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for another 10 years in some cities. And so, yes, I think you can make a case that, that with Republicans primarily threatening to default and what that would mean to the economy, what it would mean to, to an increase in unemployment, I think you could say that most of -- when, when Bush inherited a surplus and, over an eight-year period of time, took us to the highest deficits and debt in our history, you 've got to say call it like you see it. And the Republicans certainly have put us here. @!MR-GREGORY: But, Paul Gigot, you ca n't keep blaming Bush. I mean, there, there are just some stubborn figures. @!MR-GIGOT: The economy -- yeah, I do n't think it worked in 2010 very well. And I do n't think it 's going to work in 2012. President Obama owns this economy. And, yes, he can go and try to, " I inherited a mess, " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Republicans would concede, " Yes, you did. " But the question is, did you make it better or did you make it worse? And if not -- if unemployment a year from now is 9.1 percent or even 8.5 percent and the deficit is still a trillion dollars, and you do n't see -- and you see growth at 2 percent, the president 's going to have a very hard time winning re-election. @!MR-TODD: You know, David, the -- there, there 's something bigger that I 've found from our poll that I think we 're all missing here, which is you can see the collective frustration on the American public again at Washington. Congress hit its low that it has n't hit since March 2010, the healthcare month. You have people saying they want government to " do more, " but at the same time, they have 60 percent of them say, " Will you please do something about this debt and deficit mess? We get it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama had inherited this mess. They 're basically -- the message they 're sending us, " Just do something. " And the worst thing for both parties will be some sort of gridlock, and then look at other countries and how they 've handled that. Japan has gone through -- they go through a prime minister every six months because of a public frustration with the government 's inability to just solve problems. @!MR-GREGORY: And you know, Richard, from your vantage point, covering much of the world, the businessmen I talk to in this country who, of course, are traveling around the world say you go to a country like China, they 're not talking about America as much as they may be talking about certain European countries. That, that notion of American decline or a diminishing role in the world is something that is -- stems from an inability of our political system to meet the challenges we face. @!MR-ENGEL: The -- they talk about the United States in terms of its military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- are n't rushing here to do business. It 's become difficult. I -- primarily coming from the Arab world, it 's thought of as an unfriendly place, it 's hard to get visas, you get hassled if you 're here. And they think of us in terms of our U.S. military, which is why -- as an organization that 's still works and is still an incredibly unique capability. Which is why I 'm finding that comment that you played earlier by Secretary Gates so incredibly chilling, that he 's basically saying, " Our economy is so bad right now that we are not in a position -- and our political leadership is so fractured -- that we 're not in a position to lead the world any longer and I do n't want to be part of that. " And that 's frightening. @!MR-GIGOT: Yeah. @!MR-GREGORY: Doris, we, we showed the pictures from Greece. We can show them again demonstrations in the streets as a result of draconian cuts being made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Graham, are we being too aggressive about tackling deficits at a point when the economy still needs so much help? @!MS-GOODWIN: Absolutely. I mean, it seems to me the rational answer right now, we 've got to get the economy to grow, and then get some problems which we agree on both sides that we will have targets for cutting the deficit. I mean, most economists would argue that. But somehow the deficit has become -- it 's the same way it became with Perot, it 's become that lady in the closet. We have to deal with it, we do have to deal with it. @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MS-GOODWIN: But you 've got to deal with the economy first, get it going, and then you make promises about getting that down. @!MR-GREGORY: But even -- I 've spoken to House Republican leaders who say, you know, this is -- even our zeal to cut the debt... @!MS-GOODWIN: Mm-hmm. @!MR-GREGORY:... is hurting our ability to have a jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive ideas to say how do we get people back to work? @!MR-GIGOT: Yeah. There 's a little bit of an accountant 's mentality that comes across, I think, and that 's a problem. But I -- I think, philosophically, from an economics policy point of view, you cut spending, you 're going to help the economy, in my view. Because every dollar the government spends is a dollar that 's taken out of the private sector, which is the only place, the only place you 're going to drive growth. But the problem for the Republicans is a little too much talk about budget balancing and not enough talk about growth and jobs and getting growth back up to 3 and 4 percent. @!MR-GREGORY: Who 's hiring? Can I... @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Or investment in infrastructure. @!MR-GREGORY: Yeah. @!MAYOR-VILLARAIGOSA: Or investment in education or investment in workforce development. I mean, there is no conversation from that side of the aisle. And do n't get me wrong, I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good one. People are tired of the gridlock, the partisanship, the polarization, the shrill debate. I mean, we 're, we 're excited that the president and the speaker are on some, you know, golf tournament day. You know, the fact of the matter is, they should be talking on a regular basis, and they 're not talking. All they 're doing is screaming at one another. @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-ENGEL: You talk about money the U.S. spent fighting this global war on terrorism. I think, which is a terrible misnomer, it 's like a war on fear or something like that. And I think in many ways it has been a war of fear. But the United States spent at least a trillion dollars on this for the last decade. And we 've become very good at killing bearded men in Waziristan. But there are trade-offs. We 've -- China owns a tremendous amount of our currency, and we 've focused on other -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We 're going, we 're going to get a break in here. We 'll come back with our final segment, Trends &amp; Takeaways, a look at what was said here today and what to look for in the coming week. Plus, what are the hot political stories trending this morning? That 's coming up, right after this. @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY: We 're back. Final minutes with our roundtable here. And to review, Senator Lindsey Graham talking about what he sees as an isolationist streak within the Republican Party over foreign policy, particularly responding to the debate this week in New Hampshire, said earlier on this program this following : @(Videotape) @!SEN-GRAHAM: If you think the pathway to the GOP nomination in 2012 is to get to Barack Obama 's left on Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq, you 're going to meet a lot of headwinds. This is not a war of Afghan independence, from my point of view. This is the center of gravity against the war on terror. @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Party? Does Graham win out or does the tea party, the focus on the debt and spending ultimately win the day, which means more war weariness? @!MR-GIGOT: I think probably Graham wins out in the end, just because I think that the, the tradition, the modern tradition of the Republican Party tends to be a strong military party, and that tradition will be hard to, to beat. To really get an isolationist trend in the GOP, you 've got to go back to the ' 50s, before Eisenhower, or back to the, to the, to the, well, Woodrow Wilson. @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-GIGOT: So I think that, I think in the end Graham will win out, particularly if the president starts to make the sale on, on Libya and Afghanistan. @!MR-GREGORY: Foreign policy is still on the top three on our political trend tracker. The top stories on the big political Web sites that we 'll put up on our screen, our political trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, at number one, getting buzz from this weekend 's gathering of Republicans, the Obama-Boehner golf summit. These are stories that are still gaining attention. Libya and the war powers debate losing a little bit of steam in terms of people focusing on it, but it 's still in that top three. Now, Chuck Todd, to you. As we look ahead on the political schedule, not just for this week, but really a summer of intense campaigning, what are you watching out for? @!MR-TODD: There 's two dates that I 'm watching in particular, and number one is July 15th. That is the FEC fundraising deadline. We 're going to find out, rubber hits the road on money. How much did Mitt Romney raise? You know, you had somebody hinting from his team that they think he can get to $40 million to $50 million, a very Bush-like number when Bush was running in ' 99. What 's Tim Pawlenty 's number? Does Michele Bachmann outraise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry. If Romney has this insurmountable financial lead... @!MR-GREGORY: Right. @!MR-TODD:... Perry may bow out on this. @!MR-GREGORY: All right. And go through some of the other days, quickly. @!MR-TODD: And then I would say here August 6th is Rick Perry 's National Day of Prayer that he 's hosting. @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-TODD: Reliant Stadium, home of the Houston, Texas, in Houston. That 's going to tell us a lot. He 's not going to announce before that date. I 've been told by advisers he does n't want to politicize that thing, but it 's going to tell you, this is a guy that can speak to the tea party wing, the social conservative wing... @!MR-GREGORY: Mm-hmm. @!MR-TODD:... talk jobs, as Paul mentioned. He can put together two legs of that stool. And then finally, I think the, the Iowa Straw Poll. It 's going to tell us whether the Tim Pawlenty campaign is for real or not. @!MR-GREGORY: All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on Twitter today from President Obama, and specifically from his campaign for next year. On their campaign logo they 've made it clear, as we 've seen today, from Barack Obama it says, " Welcome to a new @BarackObama.... staff will manage this account ; tweets from president will actually be signed ' -BO. ' " So you know they 're actually coming from him. So... @!MS-GOODWIN: That 's the modern world. @!MR-GREGORY: The modern world. Everybody these days... @!MR-TODD: But he has n't tweeted yet though, right? Even he himself had to have been, " What 's Twitter? " @!MS-GOODWIN: I would think that after... @!MR-GREGORY: All right. @!MR-TODD: He did n't quite know how to do it. @!MR-GREGORY: All right. We 're going to leave it there. '
