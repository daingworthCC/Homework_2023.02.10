223241 @!THIS-IS-A-RUSH-TRA : As I said at the beginning of the show, a lot of people who read the Starr report still ca n't really come to terms with whether or not they think what 's outlined there is serious enough to impeach a president. Let 's look at what the Founding Fathers said a president could do. He would -- could only be impeached for -- and conviction of treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. Now, people have been debating what " high crimes and misdemeanors " means for the last weeks, for the last several years, as a matter of fact. But they never really explained what that meant, the fathers. And that 's the job of the House of Representatives, never easy. Twenty-four years ago when Congress was considering impeaching President Nixon, former Massachusetts Congressman Father Robert Drinan struggled with that definition as a member of the House Judiciary Committee at that time. And Father Drinan joins us now from Washington. Good morning, Father. Father ROBERT DRINAN, Former Massachusetts Congressman : Good morning. KEVIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Starr report and the White House 's response, do you believe there are grounds for impeachment this time? Father ROBERT DRINAN : I doubt it very much, because all of this is personal conduct. Yes, it 's serious. He has repented. Let me make an analogy, that in the Nixon Whitewater -- White -- Watergate, we had this problem. Mr. Nixon had back-dated his taxes. He had cheated the government. It was clearly a provable felony. Yet the vast majority of the House Judiciary Committee, including myself, said that that is not an impeachable offense. Only 12 voted that it was. It 's a private thing, and that an impeachable offense should be something that rocks the republic, that subverts the order of things, that undermines the law. And we felt that, in that one case, that is not so. And I think that you could make that analogy to what has transpired now. KEVIN NEWMAN : One of the other things the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the American people. The President has admitted to making false statements to the American people about Monica Lewinsky. Does n't that qualify as a rule for impeachment, according to the 1974 standards? Father ROBERT DRINAN : That 's the nearest to it. There 's one further factor here, however, that Mr. Clinton has repented, and he has lavishly and eloquently set forth his sorrow. We 've never had that before. Should that be taken into consideration? Impeachment means that you remove a president from office because he 's a danger to the republic. He has disgraced the republic, but furthermore, that he has to be removed in order to save the republic. And it seems to me that the repentance is a whole new factor in this proceeding. KEVIN NEWMAN : What about breaking the law? If, in fact, he committed perjury, is that serious enough offense? Father ROBERT DRINAN : Not every crime is necessarily impeachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could prove it. Furthermore, perjury is very, very difficult to prove. You have to have the specific intent. I think that 's the nearest, in my judgment, to something that is impeachable. KEVIN NEWMAN : But again, you do n't think that this should go forward. Father ROBERT DRINAN : Well, I think it 's up to them. I think it 's conceivable that they would say that this is too disruptive, that he has repented, that this tends to be in the private sector, and that they would say that it 's not impeachable. They may have the fallback position, nice and comfortable, but it does n't mean anything, that they censure him. KEVIN NEWMAN : All right, Father Drinan, thank you for being with us this morning. We appreciate it. We 're going to turn now to Jonathan Turley. He 's a professor at the George Washington University Law School. He 's written two opinion pieces, one in today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " USA Today, " essentially saying, Jonathan, if I 'm correct, that even though his misconduct is personal in nature, it 's still impeachable. JONATHAN TURLEY, George Washington University Law School : That 's right. I think it 's a dangerous thing if we get to the point where we say that some acts of perjury by a president do not rise to the level of impeachment. If you remember that impeachment is simply the term of the House finding credible evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors, and sending them to the Senate, impeachment does not mean removal. And it 's very important how we do this. It 's probably more important how we do it than what we conclude in all of this. And we would send a very dangerous message if we say that some acts of perjury, very credible acts of perjury in this case, do not rise to the level of impeachment. KEVIN NEWMAN : But why go through, then, an impeachment process? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying is that we could impeach the President, but in the Senate, when it comes up to its vote on it, it could say, " No, we 're not going to kick you out of office. " Why go through the process of impeachment and put the country through that if, in the end, what you 're saying is, he wo n't truly be punished by losing his job? JONATHAN TURLEY : Well, I think that the act of impeachment is punishing. That is, by being impeached, the Congress says, " Your conduct is the type for which a president could lose his office, " and that sends a message to future presidents. When a president commits crimes, he loses legal legitimacy. A president needs both political and legal legitimacy to govern. And the only way that you get that legitimacy back is to stand before the country in the well of the Senate and have the American people give it back to you. Then you can continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like being a partially impeached president, and that causes great difficulties for all of us. What are we going to do in the future? Are we going to continue to prosecute perjury cases? People who 've done conduct almost indistinguishable from the President? How do we handle that? KEVIN NEWMAN : But I guess the difference here is not -- the average person would n't have a $40 million grand jury chasing down his personal life. JONATHAN TURLEY : Well, the problem, though, is that much of the money spent and the time spent on this was because the President actively pursued a campaign of misrepresentation. For months, he allowed and encouraged his staff to attack the credibility of witnesses, who apparently now told the truth, and to advance an argument that he knew was completely false. That 's serious by any president at any time. And so we have to in some ways make a decision as the public, but the question is where we make that decision. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this man. I 'm a lifelong Democrat. I do n't like this. But there are other things in this than the future of Bill Clinton or the outcome of this crisis. KEVIN NEWMAN : All right. Jonathan Turley, thank you for being with us as well. JONATHAN TURLEY : Thanks. KEVIN NEWMAN : As we 've seen, a lot of varying opinion, couple of people who read the report in two very different ways.
