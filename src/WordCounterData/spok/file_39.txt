225341 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : Segment One : witness to history. That 's President Clinton 's role this morning at the Wadi Araba Crossing on Jordan 's border with Israel. The peace treaty formally ends more than 40 years of war between the two countries. But what does it really mean to the Mideast and the president? Let 's go live now to Wadi Araba and ask our Connie Chung and CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante. Good morning. @!CONNIE-CHUNG-repor : Good morning, Paula. This treaty closes the history of conflict between Israel and Jordan, Paula. Jordan had fallen into disfavor in supporting Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War, but now Jordan is back in favor. It was in 1979 that Camp David was signed, the agreement between Egypt and Israel. And just last year, Israel and the PLO ; and now Jordan and Israel are signing this historic treaty. I 'm watching the monitor here hoping that you 're seeing the same thing that we are watching. There are hundreds of people here. A delegation, along with President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!ZAHN : Connie, you talked about to -- today -- the signing today representing a critical step in the overall peace process. You had the opportunity to talk with Prime Minister Rabin yesterday. What did he say about how he expects this to move the -- the rest of the peace process forward? @!CHUNG : Well, Jordan was critical in that Israel and Jordan had been friends. In the last few decades, actually, there had not been as much animosity as earlier. So this is a popular peace treaty. It 's a -- it 's a warm peace. What is significant is that it puts Isr -- Syria in the last holdout position. Syria now must negotiate. Economically, it is a poor country. And it is only in the position that it must -- it is time for Syria to come forward and make a concession. President Clinton, of course, is meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad tomorrow morning. The Israelis want and expect some kind of concession. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Warren Christopher and President Clinton are saying, ' Do n't expect any breakthroughs. ' @!ZAHN : I want to ask Bill Plante about that right now, because it seems that the White House has been lowering expectations of -- of what might come out of that meeting. What is the White House spin on that today? @!BILL-PLANTE-report : Paula, they always lowball. They never want to promise more than they can deliver. They obviously hope, though, that President Clinton 's being there talking to President Assad in Damascus -- first president to do so since Richard Nixon 20 years ago -- will make some difference, will move the peace process forward. There 's no guarantee of that. They 've tried to tell the Syrians that the president would n't come unless President Assad was willing to move forward. But he had to go. He had to go both for the sake of the American prestige and because the Israelis are very anxious to move the peace process forward. The president is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least of which is to help himself, of course, too, because he 's having such a hard time at home. @!ZAHN : Let 's talk about the risks, though, the president is taking. He 's visiting a nation that 's on the list of terrorist nations. What must he walk away with in his meetings later today with President Assad? @!PLANTE : Paula, they keep telling us that we 're not going to expect it -- should n't expect to see anything -- any immediate results. And, of course, they would love nothing more than to be able to announce, after that meeting is over tomorrow, that the Syrians have agreed to take some specific step in -- in meeting Israel, to move their peace process with Israel forward, but they keep telling us not to expect it. The very least, I think, that they hope to get is a statement from Assad that he is committed to the peace process, that he is committed to meeting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to to say, ' This is -- this is worth every moment. This is worth what we came for. ' @!ZAHN : Connie, I wanted to talk about the PLO for a moment. A general strike has been called by PLO leader Yasir Arafat. He has shut down the West Bank in Arab East Jerusalem. It 's in protest over the signing of this peace treaty. They 're upset over a provision that gives Jordan a -- a role in -- in running East Jerusalem holy sites. When -- what did Mr. Rabin say about that yesterday? @!CHUNG : Prime Minister Rabin feels that PLO chief Yasir Arafat has to live up to the agreement that he signed, and that is to be effective when it comes to the Palestinian militants, to the Hamas and try and crack down. The difficulty, of course, is that if Arafat cracks down on the militants, he 'll end up with a civil war within his own ranks. So when President Clinton met with Yasir Arafat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his part. And, of course, Arafat said that he would try to go along, but he 's in an untenable situation in that the Hamas is a -- is a very effective group and has -- has caused a great deal of pain and terrorism throughout in these last several weeks -- the 22 killed in the bus bombing. It 's a difficult situation. Rabin feels that he can hold Ar -- Arafat responsible for certain areas of Hamas terrorism, but also feels that if -- if the Israelis are in charge of those particular areas, then he can not hold Arafat responsible. Paula. @!ZAHN : All right. Connie Chung, Bill Plante, reporting from Wadi Araba this morning on the border of Israel and Jordan on this very historic day -- peace between Israel and Jordan after 46 years. Let 's go back to Harry now at 16 minutes past the hour. @!HARRY-SMITH-@1Co-h : Thanks, Paula. Coming up next, too close to call. We 're going to see how America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still ahead in our next hour this morning, the fight to free innocent prisoners ; plus, Hattie Kauffman on crime in the hospital and Gene Siskel on the sports film of the season, " Hoop Dreams.
