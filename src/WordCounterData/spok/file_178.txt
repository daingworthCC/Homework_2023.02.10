4072441 @!AUDIENCE-MEMBER-@1# I was wondering if maybe if you checked out some of the statistics about legalizing prostitution, gambling, drugs and nonviolent crime, in order to stimulate some of the economy. @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O# I appreciate the boldness of your question. That will not be my jobs strategy. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So, we know what 's not in President Obama 's new jobs program. He 's going to lay out some new ideas on Tuesday. We 're going to talk about that in a minute, but let 's begin with Afghanistan on our " Roundtable ". I 'm joined, as always, by George Will, Peggy Noonan of " The Wall Street Journal ", the president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass, and Katrina vanden Heuvel of " The Nation. " @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) And George, I want to start by showing everyone a poll that we had earlier this week, of presidents approval in wartime. You see Johnson, Truman and George W Bush there, basically ski slopes, as they dealt with unpopular wars. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit strategy that President Obama has proposed. And he said it was in our vital national interest. But clearly, there is political imperative at play. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Those were unpopular wars. And so is this one. And there 's really no precedent that I can think for the public again rallying behind a war that they have decided they did n't like in the first place. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well the initial support for the President 's speech. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Sure. For the speech. But this is, this is not the McChrystal plan. Let me say this in defense of the President. He 's - McChrystal proposed, essentially, nation-building, meeting the " needs " of the Afghan people, his words, by, with, and through the almost nonexistent Afghan government. This is not that. This is an increase in forces in order to constrict the mission. But this is going to be harder than it was in Iraq. In Iraq, you had a literate society. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important, when our surge began in Iraq, the tide had already turned. There had been the Sunni awakening in Anbar. They had turned against al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who were largely foreign fighters. The Taliban are there. When you asked Secretary Gates about the Helmand operation, he said, very tellingly. It 's going very well wherever the marines are present. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) They ca n't be everywhere. @!**29;519;TOOLONG @(Off-camera) And as long as they 're present. But they wo n't be there forever. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Richard, except you write in " Newsweek " magazine this week, Richard that this should be labeled the no exit plan. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# Well wars are always easier to get into than out of. And this is unlikely to be an exception to that. We 'll do the surge. And as George, as I think correctly pointed out, as long as we 're there, things will be better. But I think it would have to be the triumph of hope over experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we go back, say, to pre-surge levels, that any improvements will endure. That would mean that the Afghan government had picked up tremendous capacity. And that the Pakistani government had discovered tremendous will. And I would think both of those are open questions. So odds are, to me, that the United States will find itself in Afghanistan for some time to come, along, by the way, in Iraq for some time to come. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Presidents Obama is at risk of losing part of his coalition. I 'm deeply saddened by this speech because the facts on the ground do n't lend itself to this policy. At a time of true unemployment of 17%, we 're sending 100 - we 're sending 30,000 additional troops, for a 100,000-force, at $100 billion, when his own national security adviser said there was no national vital interest at stake. We 're going to destabilize... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Said clearly there was. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Yeah, but I mean this was a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed country, Pakistan. And, you know, wars suck the oxygen out - George know - out of reform presidencies. We 've seen it throughout our history. And so the prospect of the reform agenda President Obama ran on is one that is at risk. And I think we could have done a very smart counterterrorism strategy at far lesser cost. And we have national security threats around the world. This will limit his options in that area. And I think, you know, the larger problem is we need a new national security. President Obama ran not as an anti-war president, anti-Iraq war. And he is not hostage to the mindset in Washington. But he is to a certain extent because... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But he also ran on finishing the war in Afghanistan. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# But he 's... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But Peggy, let me bring this to you. Because I think one of the things Katrina says is something that was weighing on the President 's mind at the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest of his agenda. But by the time... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Sure. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera)... he gave that speech, he, he talked about that, but also seemed quite at peace with the decision. @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Oh, he did. But, look, I think the key number here is nine. It 's not 30,000 troops. It 's not July 2011. It 's nine. That 's the number of years we have been in Afghanistan. That is enough time for the American people to essentially decide how they 're viewing it. I think they will probably give more time to the President after his decision. But I also think it is up to the people to decide. And we 'll see how they 're deciding, month-by-month, in the polls. How they feel about this war. No president, certainly nine years in, can execute and lead a war if the people are not with him. He 's not only in trouble with his base. I think he, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're probably... @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL#... of convincing people after nine years, this is still good. It 's viable. We 've got a new plan here, it can work. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So at best, he 's bought himself a little bit of time. The clock is ticking to, at best, again, 2011. But we have no clarity, talking to both Secretary Gates and Clinton, about what happens in July 2011. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Not much because the situation - the President did, with a little bit of rhetoric, leave wiggle room. And he will wiggle. That is the conditions on the ground are not going do be dramatically different then than they are now. Therefore, his hope of beginning withdrawal, 12, 13, 14 months before the next presidential election, is probably going to go a glimmering. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# That 's exactly right. And the answer is none of us knows how this is going to work out. My hunch is that after 18 months, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep coming back then to, George, the President really has to answer, not simply the question of will it work, but is it worth it? And I simply do n't think they 've made the case either that Afghanistan is central to the global effort against terrorism. Quite honestly, it 's not. This is not 1991, or this is not, rather, 2001, right after 9/11. Afghanistan is not the home or the sanctuary for al Qaeda. Nor is Afghanistan central to Pakistan, which is what really matters. It 's... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well that 's the key point, though. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# Right. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Because you saw a fundamental difference there between Secretary Gates on the one hand and Senator Feingold on the other. Does putting more troops in Afghanistan make the situation more secure in Pakistan or less? @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# It makes it worse in the sense that you 're pushing a lot of bad guys across the border. The biggest question is regardless of whatever we do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seriousness about cracking down on what has essentially become an internal threat of their own long-term survival? Up until now, they have not. And the answer is obviously why. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Can I just... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let me put the question to you this way. If they see us leave Afghanistan, would n't the Pakistanis say, we 're next? They 're going to abandon us again. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# No. I think it 's much more complicated. And our occupation of Pakistan is going to deepen divisions in Pakistan and destabilize an already fragile civilian government. I mean, we are already engaged in a secret war in Pakistan. " The Nation 's " cover story this week, based on multiple sources, shows that Blackwater is working with a joint special operations command, planning targeted assassinations and drone campaigns. This is fundamentally destabilizing. We need another policy. The larger overlay of all of this in my view, is our overreaction to the terrible, horrible tragedy of 9/11, has led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage a conventional war, which we are doing in Afghanistan, against an odious, horrifying set of ideas or tactics. And until we end that, we are, as an American people, going to have a de facto policy of permanent warfare. Do we want that in this country? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I 'm going to bring up a Pew poll that shows perhaps we don't. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# We do n't. I do n't... @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) It was fascinating this week the Pew Center did a look at the sense of isolationist sentiment in the country. Should we be minding our own business? 49% say that we should be minding our own business. That 's the highest it 's been in years, the highest in 40 years. And, Peggy, that gets to your point. Not only a war-weary nation, a nation turning inward. @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# That 's a post-9/11 poll. Do you know what I mean? That was not the mood after September 2001. A number of things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might be created and suck in more trouble if American troops just abruptly left. It seems to me, that is a destabilizing move. And if Obama is just buying time, in effect, as those - as Russ Feingold said, it 's going to take time then I think that will probably seem reasonable to people. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# But we should not just leave. And there 's a choice between doing as much as we 're now doing and leaving. You know, sometimes there is a gray in between area. The middle course is not always wrong. And rather than simply surging more troops, which is not clear to me is going to work, we could take a lot of the rest of the strategy, which is, by the way, where we 're going to end up, which is more emphasis on training, not just in Kabul but around the country, a greater emphasis to win over some of the Taliban, some counterterrorism and so forth. We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate with our interests. We have to avoid these situations where 's we do everything, which is more than situations warrant, or we simply abandon a country like Afghanistan. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# But at the, at the end of the day, Afghanistan, Pakistan, this region, will require political and diplomatic solutions. I interviewed Gorbachev in September. Secretary Gates, in my view, took the wrong lessons from the soviet invasion in Afghanistan and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev says very clearly, and he has had insight into this, political, diplomatic, regional work needs to be done. No one is talking about abandoning. But the idea of pouring money and troops in, the US footprint growing larger is we are going to be an occupying force. Barack Obama spoke eloquently about we are not an occupying force. We are perceived as such. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And George, he 's going to have the chance to speak again this Thursday when he goes to Oslo to accept the Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oslo? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) The Oslo venture is so surreal. I mean, he 's going to give a speech, thanking them for an award given to him because of the quality of the speeches he gives. All he can say is that I am fighting a war to stop the destabilization of these countries. And we 've got some help. And he 's going to, perhaps, by then be able to say already that NATO members are pony up. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera)... thousand. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Still... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Could you write that speech? @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Oh, you know, this is just the sort of thing that, well, normally, a sitting American president wins a Nobel Prize that 's just good. You definitely get a bounce out of the Nobel Peace Prize. Not in this case because of what George says. I just think people will look at it and think, oh man, this is just more talk in a fancier tuxedo. You know? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) From the speech - the teeth of it. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# Oh no, he 's got to. And he 's got to, in a sense - the one opportunity here, it 's interesting to go to Oslo for a Nobel Peace Prize speech, and argue why there has to be a security component. And actually that 's where I disagree with Katrina. It 's not a question of just politics or just economics. What we 've learned in history, you get overwhelmed by having those kinds of strategies. There has to be a security component. My problem with the policy is I think it 's out of balance. That the security component has now grown more than it should. One last point, Pakistan, they have a different agenda than we have. They see Afghanistan as their hedge. It is the real estate that they have to make sure they 're not surrounded by India. We have a problem. We have a partner that does not share the same geopolitical outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistanis are worried about being abandoned by the United States again. We have to keep in mind that we 're very much working in tandem with someone who has very different geopolitical goals. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let me bring this back to our domestic agenda. We 've got some jobs numbers on Friday. Unemployment actually went down 10.2% to 10%. Before the President goes to Oslo, he 's going to give a speech on Tuesday, laying out some new ideas on how to create new jobs. And one of the big questions at issue is whether to tap the TARP, the bailout fund to pay for some of these programs. There 's debate already on Capitol Hill. @GRAPHICS @!REPRESENTATIVE-NAN# Creating jobs reduces the deficit. And I think the TARP funds are an appropriate use - appropriately used to create jobs to reduce the deficit. @!REPRESENTATIVE-JOH# What we ought to do with that money is use it, use it to reduce the budget deficit. There 's no, there 's no - nobody ever had any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and spend it on something else. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The next big fight, the President says he 's going to tap it. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And Senator Thune of South Dakota is going to give senators a chance to vote against that. The public hates TARP for, in my judgment, a lot of good reasons. Before the decline in unemployment, slight but encouraging, Democrats were saying, unemployment 's not coming down. We need to have another stimulus. As soon as you got signs that there was some job creation, the liberals said, no time to stop now, we need another stimulus. I 'll give you one number. Under the stimulus package, the Energy Department got $36.8 billion. Of which they 've spent $1.5 billion, 5%. Why have 95% of that little bit of the stimulus sitting there do we need another stimulus? @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# The recovery stimulus has helped this country avert a great recession. Though there are people in great pain out there. In order to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TARP funds and even beyond that. We should use the AIG bailout money given to Goldman Sachs, $13 billion, to give to people to create jobs, as opposed to the $17 billion payout in bonuses. And there are very smart, targeted jobs program. The economy stimulus was not a jobs program. We need to give the aid to states and localities. We need to... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) It was n't a jobs program? @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# No, it was n't. It was essentially - it was n't. I mean they may have painted it that way, but it was like to keep the economy from falling into the abyss. And I think that is - what we need is a targeted jobs program. And you know, part of the problem with the TARP is you 've given money, taxpayer money to banks. They are n't lending. And the polls show that Americans do not believe this administration is on the side of working Americans. And this administration, the Democratic Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# But there 's also an area where working Americans, in some cases represented by organized labor are not on the side of working Americans because what 's missing from this entire jobs debate is trade. The single-biggest engine of American job creation is trade policy, is export promotion. And where are we? We do n't have a positive trade policy. This is the best way to have non-inflationary stimulus that does n't break the budget. It does n't cost us a dollar. Let 's start negotiating in earnest a global free trade... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Is our trade policy. @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# Well, not enough. It 's a start, but it 's not enough of one. @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Hello. Well this is all a mess. The, the public does n't like all this spending. People naturally look and they think the guys who have got the system wired are getting it. The guys in Detroit are getting it. Goldman Sachs is getting it. People who have the system wired are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this spending, in my view. I do n't think they 'll mind terribly if all of the sudden it looks like some money is going to jobs creation in jobs that people can actually see. This is a pure political calculation. But I do n't think it will be so terribly unhappy. I think it will be removed in the public imagination from the feeding the pigs at the trough, which is what the last year has looked like. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Every dollar... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# We 're back to where you saw this, George, close-up. I mean it is again Bob Rubin, in the White House, with you, Carville, Robert Reich. It is the deficit hawks versus... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Carville was n't in the White House. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# All right. Well, you know, maybe - but putting people, no, but putting people first. And you 've got Geithner, by the way, in the White House, wanting to use the TARP money to pay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we need to use this money at a times of crisis, of emergency in this country. And we can afford the deficit. And by the way, when you get outside of Washington, and you ask people about jobs versus deficit, it 's a myth that people are crazy about reducing the deficit at all costs. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But they 're crazy about both. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# That is just not on the minds of ordinary, non-pundit, ordinary, living Americans. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Said she from Manhattan. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Hey. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Look, every dollar... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Burlington? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera)... you want to siphon out of the economy by the government to spend on the economy, comes from the economy. The sky is dark, Katrina, with dollars flying back and forth between consumers and Washington and states. That 's not how you stimulate the economy. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) A couple of minutes left before we go. Gate-crasher gate reached a new level this week. Hearings on Capitol Hill. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary Desiree Rogers did not. Led to this exchange in the White House briefing room. @!MARK-SULLIVAN-@1DI# In our line of work, we can not afford even one mistake. Although these individuals went through magnetometers and other levels of screening, their entry into the White House... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The wrong tape up there. But that was - what you heard there was the head of the Secret Service saying we could n't make mistakes. But, George, it was an interesting choice by the White House. Desiree Rogers, the social secretary, called to testify. They refused citing separation of powers. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Executive privilege and all the rest, yes. Look, what 's interesting about this is we saw this week an example of the excessive security concerns in this country. Those cadets who listened to the President 's speech were in their seats three hours before he talked. Now think about this. He 's talking at West Point. He 's surrounded by the United States Army. And they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the guest list at the White House right? @!RICHARD-HAASS-@1PR# Coming back to the White House decision. There will be moments over the next three years when this president and this administration are going to need to claim executive privilege, where you 've got to protect the confidentiality and the privacy of what this or that adviser says to the President and vice versa. This does n't seem to me to meet that standard. And the risk, therefore, is they create a whole pushback or backlash in the Congress and the American public by this expansive claim of executive privilege, when it does n't, when it does n't apply. This is not about confidential conversations between the President and a staff member. It 's about performance of certain people and its impact on American security, which, by the way, goes beyond the administration. All Americans have a stake in the security of a White House and the security of a president. My reaction to this would simply be preserve and save executive privilege. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had Desiree Rogers go up and testify? @!PEGGY-NOONAN-@1WAL# Yes. I think that would have been wise. I must say, on the party-crashers what fascinated me this week, is the shock of the party-crashing couple that people had criticized them. They showed up on TV, stricken. Looking like, okay, we did this thing. It was bad for security. It was bad in every way. But we did n't know we 'd be criticized. That 's - in a way, it 's understandable, they felt the way they felt, because the line of acceptable behavior keeps moving. These people did n't know where that little sucker was, that little line. You know? It 's sort of everybody can do what they want. There 's a heedlessness that is sort of out there. And it 's fascinating to me. @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# Well I mean I think we have to be worried about egregious security lapses. This president, I believe, has received record number of death threats. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crasher-gate. I mean our media is addicted to silliness. I bet if we did a survey of the media this past week there would be as many references to the crasher-gate, as there are to Afghanistan and the President 's speech. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I doubt it. We may have been close... @!KATRINA-VANDEN-HEU# I swear. There 's an addiction to silliness. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The exit strategy begins here. We 're out of time. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) This " Roundtable " is gon na continue in " The Green Room " on ABCNews.com. @!ANNOUNCER-# " This Week " with George Stephanopoulos brought to you by...
