232541 UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU! @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Attention, young Americans : Uncle Sam Needs You! There was a time when a simple poster with a straightforward appeal to patriotism and duty could be counted on to fill out the ranks of America 's military. But with the country enjoying peace overseas and prosperity at home, recruiters are working harder than ever, but finding fewer and fewer takers, and that, in turn, is taking the country down an uncharted path. Rita Braver reports our cover story. @(Footage-of-West-Po) @!RITA-BRAVER-report : @(Voiceover) Amid the pomp and pageantry of West Point cadets on full dress parade, it 's hard to imagine that there 's a big problem in recruiting the troops that these future officers will command. qwq @( Footage-of-Thompso Staff Sergeant SWAINE THOMPSON( Military Recruiter) : All right. You take care. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But Army Staff Sergeant Swaine Thompson knows all about the problem. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Hey, what 's going on? You ever thought about the Army? @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) It 's his job to try to recruit volunteers... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now, so do n't act like you do n't know me when I call you. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover)... anywhere in Chicago he can hunt them down. @(Footage-of-Thompso) @!Sgt-THOMPSON : You a veteran? No, that 's OK. We 're looking for the young. We 're looking for the young. @(Voiceover) I look for target spots. I look for places where kids in the target age would be at -- fast food restaurants, the parks. You ever thought about the Army? Why not, why not? How old are you? @(Voiceover) A lot of times people say ' No ' because this is the first immediate reaction when they see the uniform. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? You got to go? All right. @!BRAVER : How many kids a month do you personally get to sign up, Sergeant? @!Sgt-THOMPSON : A month? @!BRAVER : Mm-hmm. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : One, maybe two. @!Hi-My-name-is-Serg# What I need to do is get beyond the ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three or five minutes and let them know something about the Army that they did n't know. @(Footage-of-Thompso) @!Sgt-THOMPSON : And the Army is a great opportunity, and I 'm here to tell you why. The United States Army offers a lot of benefits, many benefits to get you where you want to be. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) This 12-year career Army man spends a lot of time in Chicago high schools, like Lane Tech. He hammers home the educational benefits. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : We have a program called the Army college fund. Have you heard of it? All right. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) College is paid for, up to $ 50,000 in benefits for a five-year tour of duty. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : You can come into the Army, get job training in one of over 200 different career fields, free training. We 're going to pay you for that training, and at the same time, you can go to school part-time. So you can do something that I call ' the total person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with out here in recruiting -- the total person. Your resume is double-stacked. You 've got work experience. It shows leadership. You 've earned awards. So basically, what have I given you? I 've given you an option, a road map, and I 'm waiting on somebody so ask me, ' What 's basic training? ' Unidentified Student : What 's basic training? @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Thank you. This is what basic training is. Give him a hand. @(Footage-of-student) @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Want to get down? Down, up, down. Can you do it? Can you do it? Stop. Get up. If you can at least do one push-up and one sit-up, the drill sergeant will take you the rest of the way. @(Visual-of-of-Selec) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Ever since the draft was abolished in 1973, the military has had to beat the bushes hard to attract enough volunteers. Unidentified Officer :( From vintage footage)... do hereby acknowledge that you are voluntarily enlisted... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in today 's economy, with good jobs so plentiful. And every service, except the Marines, is having trouble making recruitment goals. This year, the Navy squeaked by, but the Air Force was down by about 1,700, and the Army down by about 6,300. @(Footage-of-Thompso) @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Hey, how you doing? You a look like a college student. Unidentified Woman : Sorry. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : You 're sorry? OK. That 's all right. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) It 's a story Sergeant Thompson has heard too often. Does this economic boom mean that people say, ' Hey, I do n't need the military? ' @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Economic boom, the MTV, ' Give it to me now, ' Pepsi, all these fancy commercials, designers clothes -- I 'm -- I 'm fighting all that. @(Footage-of-band-pr) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) He does cut through to a few kids, like Eric Rodriguez, who plans to join the reserve officer corps. @!ERIC-RODRIGUEZ-@1S : It helps me shoot towards, you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be. you know? I do n't just want to be a nobody. I want to be a somebody. @(Footage-of-Braver-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But there are a lot more youngsters like Mine Barin. @!MINE-BARIN-@1Stude : It 's not very appealing to me. I just -- you know, I just see that the military 's just not for me, you know. I -- I 'm not one who -- I mean, I -- I take orders from my parents and stuff, but for me, I know that sounds kind funny, but I do n't -- I do n't like to take orders. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Or Brandon Coleman. @!BRANDON-COLEMAN-@1 :... because if you join the Army you might have to, you know, like if it 's a war or something, you might have to fight. And I do n't want to have to fight, in, like, in, you know, like any wars or anything. @(Footage-of-militar) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) In reality, while operations like Desert Storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless a recruit signs up for a fighting job, there 's little chance of seeing combat. @(Footage-of-West-Po) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) But with the end of the draft, many young Americans simply do n't know anything about the military, or anyone who 's been in it. Even West Point, which always fills its ranks, encounters the problem. Colonel Michael Jones, director of admissions. Colonel MICHAEL JONES( West Point Director of Admissions) : I mean, it 's not unusual for me to go into a candidate meeting with parents and children, traveling around the country, and to have none of the sets of parents have any uniformed experience in the armed services, either active duty, National Guard or reserve. That is the typical case now. qwq @( Footage-of-the-Coh Unidentified Man : Great to see you again, sir. Welcome to( unintelligible). Thank you very much. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Secretary of Defense William Cohen agrees that the Pentagon 's message is not getting out. Both he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major advocate for the armed services, say that in times of relative peace, the military is just not on most Americans ' radar screens. @!Ms-JANET-LANGHART- : They 're so busy enjoying this great economy, they 're so busy being on the Internet, and surfing with remote controls, and driving their cars, and taking their kids to ball games, and going to the mall, all the great things that our men and women make possible for them to do. So it 's -- it 's -- it 's human nature to say ' Unless there 's a conflict to -- or -- or -- or a threat to the homeland, we do n't think about it. ' @!BRAVER : Do you think that we 're in a crisis? Secretary WILLIAM COHEN( Defense Department) : I do n't think it 's a crisis. I think it 's always challenging, certainly, but it 's not a crisis. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) And it 's just part of the challenge facing the Pentagon. @(Footage-of-Navy-re) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job, well, there 's also another one : convincing experienced soldiers to re-up. qwq @( Footage-of-Sires-a Sergeant WILLIAM SIRES : Yeah, yeah -- you tell ' em. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) After eight years in the service, Sergeant William Sires says that even though his wife works, too, with their new baby, he just ca n't afford to stay in on about $ 400 a week. @!Sgt-SIRES : If I was the only one supporting the family, I would go on food stamps, and that 's something that I -- I do n't believe should ever happen while you 're serving -- serving your country. The opportunities out on the civilian side are just too good to pass up. The pay is better, the hours are better, overtime, stuff like that. @(Footage-of-Clinton) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) President Clinton has just signed a 4.8 percent military pay raise, the largest since 1981, and that has kept some people in uniform, but Sergeant Sires is not impressed. @!Sgt-SIRES : Four percent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say, ' Here 's a 4 percent raise, ' that 's only 4 cents. That does n't make even a dent on the -- on the -- on the things that you need to -- to -- to carry on the daily life. @(Footage-of-militar) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Starting in July, there will be new promotion bonuses. And to boost their ranks, both the Army and Navy have relaxed requirements, accepting more recruits without traditional high school diplomas. @(Footage-of-Braver-) @!Mr-CHARLES-MOSKOS- : I 'm very fearful now that we 're going to hear more and more rationalizations of dropping quality. We should look up the educational ladder, not down. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Charles Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern University, says the military needs to change its strategy to go after more college students. @!Mr-MOSKOS : We need a new option, which is a short enlistment, say 15 months, in which a young person, after graduating from college, would train for several months and then go overseas to places like Bosnia, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, of the junior year abroad, if I can use that kind of an expression. We 're going to do something different, and then I 'm going to return to my civilian life. @(Footage-of-Braver-) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) Defense Secretary William Cohen questions the economics of that proposal. @!Sec-COHEN : It 's if you have too much turnover with shorter and shorter periods of service, then you have more and more people coming in, you have tremendous expense involved. @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) What, then, are the long-term solutions? One of the things people seem to be talking about is bringing back the draft. Is that realistic? @!Sec-COHEN : I do n't think it 's realistic, and I do n't think it 's necessary. We have to be better able to identify those types of messages that will appeal to our young people, to inspire them, to really appeal to their sense of patriotism, all of that, I think, is -- is necessary. @(Footage-of-various) @!BRAVER : @(Voiceover) So the armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, recruiters like Army Sergeant Swaine Thompson are finding it a tough sell. @!Sgt-THOMPSON : Hey, can I talk to you all? Can I talk to you-all, or are you-all in a hurry? You in a hurry? All right. You take care. @(Visual-of-SUNDAY-M) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Next on SUNDAY MORNING, remembering Charles Mingus -- a visit with the woman who is keeping the Mingus Big Band big. @(Announcements)
