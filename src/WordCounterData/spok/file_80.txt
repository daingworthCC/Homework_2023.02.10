233241 PACO TAIBO @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Gather a group of mystery writers and one subject they are sure to discuss is how to keep their main character from being knocked off in each death-defying novel. In his continuing series about mystery writers, Anthony Mason found one sly Spaniard who hosts such a gathering each year and who has found a novel way to keep his hero alive. @(Footage-of-writers) @!ANTHONY-MASON-repo : @(Voiceover) You are aboard a private train making its way across Spain with a most unusual cargo... @!Mr-PACO-IGNACIO-TA : So the title of the book will be " The Black American and the South Mexican. " @(Footage-of-writers) @!MASON : @(Voiceover)... a cargo of crime writers... Unidentified Woman : Do you know real culprits? Unidentified Man 1 : Yeah. @(Footage-of-writers) @!MASON : @(Voiceover)... from all over the world. Unidentified Man 2 : And I 've got a character in a jail in Jamaica, and I have to figure out how to get him out. @(Footage-of-writers) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) This merry band is on an eight-hour journey from Madrid, north to the coastal city of Gijon, where their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semana Negra, Black Week. They call this the Black Train. @(Footage-of-Taibo-s) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) And its engine, the festival 's organizer, is an irrepressible Mexican mystery writer named Paco Ignacio Taibo II. @!Mr-TAIBO : So there 's something mythological about the train, the Black Train that goes. Even some people think that the train is black. @!MASON : It 's actually blue. @!Mr-TAIBO : It 's actually blue, yeah. And it 's -- but -- but some people think it 's a black train, you know. And -- and children say in Gijon, ' The Black Train is coming, ' and I like that -- that kind of idea ; that something is coming into everyday life that will change it for 10 days, no? @(Footage-of-band-pl) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) In Gijon, the writers arrive in triumph. They are the stars at Paco 's party from the moment they step off the train and Black Week formally begins. Not a lot of writers get -- get that kind of reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that 's the idea. Writers finally could be a hero, no? @(Footage-of-ribbon-) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Semana Negra is more than a writer 's festival. It 's a fiesta that stretches for miles. ' Culture, ' Taibo says, ' should be a party. ' And at his party, there are always books. @!Mr-TAIBO : So we put the first hundred books in here... @!MASON : Uh-huh. @!Mr-TAIBO :... and people will start changing. @!MASON : Are all these crime books? @!Mr-TAIBO : We started with crime books, but now we have " West of the Pecos " from Zane Grey. @!MASON : You 've got Zane Grey here. @!Mr-TAIBO : It says the only condition if you take a book, leave another one in exchange. But it works. It 's great. @(Footage-of-Taibo-s) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Taibo is a dervish, in constant motion, sucking down a smoke and chugging Cokes to keep himself going, stalled only by the occasional fuel crisis. @!Mr-TAIBO : I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your father never seems to stop moving. @!MARINA : Nope. He makes six novels at the same time. @(Footage-of-Marina-) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Taibo 's daughter Marina helps him run the festival. @!MARINA : And thinking. The whole time, he 's thinking. Even when he sleeps, he 's making a novel. @(Footage-of-keyboar) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Taibo has written nearly 50 books -- biographies, histories. In the ' 70s, he turned to crime. You 've written nine books about one particular character. @!Mr-TAIBO : Hector Belascoaran Shayne. @!MASON : What kind of name is that? @!Mr-TAIBO : Hector is a common name. @!MASON : Yeah. @!Mr-TAIBO : Belascoaran is a Basque name. And Shayne is an Irish name, OK? I decided that if -- if I have a character with those names set in Mexico City, if you believe he exists, it 's because the character is very strong. @(Footage-of-words-o) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) ' It was a joke, just one hell of a big joke, thinking he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the course of six short months, there had been six attempts on his life, with a scar to show for every one. ' He 's lost an eye. @!Mr-TAIBO : Yeah, poor guy. It 's not easy to be a private eye in Mexico City. And he 's not a private eye, he 's an independent eye. @!MASON : What is an independent eye? @!Mr-TAIBO : An independent eye is a -- is a detective who has no links with -- with anything that means power, structure of power, no? @(Footage-of-words-o) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) ' His only chance for survival was to accept the chaos and quietly become one with it. Take yourself lightly, but take the city seriously -- the city, that inscrutable porcupine bristling with quills and soft wrinkles. Hell, he was in love with Mexico City ; another impossible love on his list. ' He has the distinction of being, I think, the only independent detective in crime fiction to have died three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times. Yeah, Mexicans believe in resurrection. It 's a Mexican tradition. What -- what can I do? What can I do? I kill him because the novel said, ' You have to kill the character. ' The novel pushes that kind of end. When -- when I kill him, I said, ' Gosh, I lost the character. ' My mother arrived, wro -- wro -- read the book and said, ' Son, you 're an asshole. You killed a great character. ' I received letters from fans saying, ' What are you doing? You been working three years building a character and then you kill him. ' @(Footage-of-book-ti) @!Mr-TAIBO : @(Voiceover) And I got the message. And I said, ' OK, next book, resurrection. ' @!MASON : @(Voiceover) ' I never should have fallen in love with a Mexican detective, ' she said. ' You never should have fallen in love with a dead man. ' Suddenly, she started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, skinny, mustached detective before her. ' Though he 's made Mexico his world, Taibo was born here in Gijon. @!Mr-TAIBO : I came from a leftist family on both sides : Anarchist on the mother 's side ; Socialist on the father 's side. Political debates every time after lunch. Always after lunch. Smart people. @(Vintage-photograph) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) But the politics of the tight Taibo tribe were not appreciated by the Spanish government. So in 1958, frustrated by Franco 's dictatorship, the Taibos decided it was time to go. It was a family decision, and that year, together, they all boarded the ship that would take them to Mexico. @!Mr-TAIBO : So I discovered myself at eight years old, saying, ' Well, where 's Mexico? ' @!MASON : Why Mexico? @!Mr-TAIBO : I do n't know. It was there. That 's what Edmund Hillary said to Sherpa Tenzing, right? ' It was there. ' @(Vintage-footage-of) @!Mr-TAIBO : @(Voiceover) ' Because it 's there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was intrigued by his new home, and by 1968, when students in Mexico City began rising up against the government, Paco Taibo was among them. @!Mr-TAIBO : @(Voiceover) Yeah, they tried to kill me twice in those years. I mean, I was crossing, and a soldier shoot in ' 71. And -- well, he was not trying to kill me, he was trying to kill us, which is more important. @(Vintage-footage-of) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) It would be a defining moment in his life. @!Mr-TAIBO : @(Voiceover) I discovered myself as a Mexican. It was very important for me. And in ' 68 -- I was a young boy who was born in Spain -- has half his mind there and here. But I discovered myself as a Mexican in ' 68. I said, ' This is my country. ' @(Footage-of-Mason-a) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) But his new city never completely eclipsed his old home. @!Mr-TAIBO : Mexico -- Mexico has no river, no lake, no -- no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the sound of the sea, which is very common in Gijon, was -- was with me. @(Footage-of-the-sea) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) So 11 years ago, looking to create Semana Negra, he returned to Gijon. He spends three months every year organizing the festival, dealing with every detail. Here he 's refereeing a dispute between street vendors. @!Mr-TAIBO : So you have to deal with this. It 's part of the magic of the story. @!MASON : Mm-hmm. Yeah, but you 're a -- you 're a writer. @!Mr-TAIBO : Well, that 's why I can fix these kind of things. Do you think a non-writer will be able to deal with these kind of things? @!MASON : He 's a pretty amazing guy. @!MARINA : Yeah. Yes. He makes -- I do n't know. I think for me, he 's a magician. He makes everything possible. @(Footage-of-fire-ea) @!MASON : @(Voiceover) Only a magician could bring fire-eaters and Ferris wheels to a writer 's festival. Paco Taibo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead. @(Footage-of-SUNDAY-) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) Lost in space with John Leonard, when SUNDAY MORNING returns. @(Announcements) @(Footage-of-SUNDAY-) @!OSGOOD : @(Voiceover) L minus two minutes and counting, L for Leonard, when SUNDAY MORNING returns. @(Announcements)
