244841 SONYA : Hello, and welcome to our Tuesday show. New York Hotel magnate, Leona Helmsley was sentenced to four years in prison last week for her conviction on tax evasion charges. Her case is one of many to become the focus of the public 's fascination with high profile defendants as well as the focus of questions about whether a famous or infamous person can get a fair trial and a fair sentence. Leona Helmsley 's attorney is Alan Dershowitz. He 's with us today. He 's a professor at Harvard University Law School. His other famous clients, by the way, we should mention have included people like Claus von Blow, Michael Milken, Jim Bakker. He 's also the author of the book Chutzpah. And joining us, too, is Michael Kennedy, the attorney for Jean Harris who was convicted in 1980 in the murder of Scarsdale diet doctor, Herman Tarnower. Welcome to both of you. You know, Alan, people see Leona- Some people see Leona as a magnificent actress ; a woman who was tough as nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own acts. Others say, ' Unfair! She did n't murder anybody, would have paid back the money. She 's really getting a terribly unfair shake out of the judicial system. ' Now, I know that you 're her attorney, but on balance, how do you see it? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, Leona Helmsley 's Attorney : I wish she were a good actress. I wish this was not true. The objective medical tests- You ca n't fake an MRI. An MRI showed three strokes. The EKG showed that she has very, very serious cardiac illness. Her husband is 83 years old, was found incompetent by the judge to stand trial and is very, very sick. This is a death penalty case. Mrs. Helmsley is being asked on April 15th to kiss her husband goodbye for the last time and to say to him, ' Harry Helmsley, I will never again see you in my life or in your life. ' SONYA : That sounds very tender, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to celebrity status clients, we would n't pay attention to that kind of an argument with Joe Doe off the street. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : We do all the time. I 've done a study of every one of the cases in New York in the last five years for tax offenses. The vast majority of people get probationary sentences, and in the vast majority of cases where there are medical problems, the Joe Doe or Jane Doe, they get special consideration. Not special in the sense that because they 're rich, they 're given special treatment, but the law provides that you do n't impose the death penalty for tax offenses. Moreover, we have proof that we 're trying to present to the judge on the basis of a new trial that she did n't do it. That is that the accountants made the decision what to allocate personal, what to allocate business. This is a woman who has paid over $ 600,000 in taxes. She has a dispute with the IRS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The IRS has just asked for an extension ' til 1995 to complete the audit. You know what my nightmare is? 1995, they 'll complete the audit and a check will be sent out to Harry and Leona Helmsley for a refund on the taxes and they 'll be no one there to open the envelope @!SONYA So you think she is being punished severely because she is aggressive, because she has a lot of money, because she is high profile and because some people do n't like her? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : And, if she were a man and had all of those traits, she would be regarded as a terrific businessman. You give a woman those very same traits and they use the ' B ' word. The ' B ' word is not applicable to men, only applicable to women. And there are a lot of people out there who are after her because of the same characteristics which in a man spells success @!SONYA Michael Kennedy, why is Jean Harris still in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the fault lies primarily with our governor and his political aspirations or lack thereof @!SONYA What did his political aspirations have to do with whether or not she gets a fair sentence and is allowed to appeal and to be reconsidered? Mr. KENNEDY : Well, I think he still has designs on a higher office, notwithstanding the fact he 's not presently running. What he continually says when we go to him for clemency, for mercy for Jean Harris, he says, ' Well, what you have to do is you have to apply to this Board of Clemency Review Board that I set up. ' And what he did is he really rigged that Board, because that Board has people on it of the most disparate political views that it is impossible for them to agree on anything. They could never have a unanimous opinion. Yet the governor requires them to make a unanimous recommendation to him before he 'll even consider @!SONYA Now, Alan came in with a study and apparently has done some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court. If you were to give us your impressions as fair as you can about Jean Harris- These are the number of people who have murdered with or without intent, accidentally or not. Certainly, we were n't there and do n't know exactly what went on. How was her sentence different or the same from the average person on the street? Mr. KENNEDY : The average person convicted of murder spends somewhere between seven and nine years in prison. Jean Harris has just completed her 11th year. And, in fact, unless the governor acts, and it does n't appear that he will, she 'll have to do four or more as a minimum to do the 15 year minimum sentence she got all because- SONYA : Now, why are n't you giving this same reason ; that this was a death penalty for Jean Harris? I mean, indeed, she is now approximately 70 years of age. And one might say that one is assigning her to death. One might even say an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not the retribution of an eye for an eye. It 's not the basis of our criminal justice system 's punishment guidelines, fortunately. What it is supposed to be is about rehabilitation and theoretical deterrents. We know that, in fact, there is virtually no deterrents from punishment such as this. Jean Harris ' crime is totally situation. Lovers with a falling out, a woman who is addicted to drugs that he prescribed for her and then actually yo-yoed her. When she would be too speedy, he would cut down the amount of speed he would give her. When she was n't speedy enough, he would increase it @!SONYA Let me just move to two points very quickly. Can the media help or hurt you in terms of how you 're viewed by a jury and when sentencing occurs or by a judge? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : They can absolutely destroy you. In this case, they portrayed Leona Helmsley as the queen of mean. They presented a totally inaccurate, unsympathetic story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what the people out there wanted. You talk about an eye for an eye. You know, the bible refers to an eye for an eye as a limitation ; no more than an eye for an eye. This is a woman who has a dispute over taxes and they 're taking her life. It violates the most primitive notions of justice @!SONYA Why were n't people more sympathetic to Jean Harris? I mean, if the argument is that one takes a look at community values, whether it 's the media or the person on the street that is actually speaking, Jean Harris, I would think, who 'd get out in 24 hours. A lot of women have felt the same way about men who have betrayed them. Mr. KENNEDY : Indeed they have. And I think had- I happen to agree with Alan on this. That if Jean Harris- If this had been a crime where Dr. Tarnower had killed Jean Harris, they probably would n't even have gone to Grand Jury. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a tremendous amount of pressure brought to bear on the governor and brought on Jean 's case because of the publicity. She was a schoolmarm, unintelligible school head mistress, not a wealthy woman, a woman of great education and a woman of high social position. Those things work against a defendant @!SONYA So, in fact, what you 're saying is that we need to pull them down to size ; that there is something within perhaps all of us including a judge or a jury that needs to humble people who have achieved the American dream either by their own or by inheritance or whatever. It is a leveling. And I 'm just going to ask you to reflect on that as we go to our audience and get their questions and comments. 212-643-0077 is our number. We 're talking about famous defendants and what happens to them when they go to trial. Commercial break SONYA : We have two of America 's best trial attorneys with us today. We 're talking with Attorney Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is Michael Kennedy, the attorney for Jean Harris. We 'll go right to phones and to Charles in New York. Hi, Charles! 1st CALLER : New York Yes, good afternoon, Sonya! SONYA : Yes. 1st CALLER : Good afternoon, Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Kennedy. I 'm calling in reference to Mrs. Helmsley 's case. I 'd just like to mention a couple of names like Miliken, Boltsky, Levine, country club sentences in Connecticut. They 're playing tennis and golf and they lost more money for widows, orphans, elderly people and they hurt thousands upon thousands of individuals as well as our country. I 'd like to know how is there justice when this woman circumvented maybe a million-two worth of her taxes and she 's going to be sent to a Kentucky prison? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Well, first of all, she did n't circumvent anything. We can prove, in fact, that she overpaid her taxes. The IRS is so confused about the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit. We have introduced new evidence showing that the accountants made the decision what to do and what to allocate. All we want is justice even if she were guilty which she 's not. A four-year sentence is way out of proportion even if she were a 25-year old man. But for a secondary signer of a tax return, you know what the message is going to be to women in America on April 15th? Do n't sign your husband 's return unless you have an independent accountant reading through every page of it. She had a ten-foot high tax return to sign with little paper clips where she should sign. And as a result of signing that tax return of her husband 's, basically, she 's being sentence to death @!SONYA Let 's go to Tom in New York. Hi, Tom! 2nd CALLER : New York Yes, hi, Sonya! I 'm sick and tired of these high priced lawyers getting on TV and they sit here and they beg for mercy for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking about Leona Helmsley obviously, for the tax fraud she committed, Mike Tyson trying to buy his way out of his sentence. And I would like to ask Mr. Kennedy one question. When is Mrs. Harris ' - The doctor she killed, when is he coming up for parole? SONYA : OK. Well, those are obvious questions that come out of an audience that looks at you two guys and say, ' You are hired mouthpieces. You are there to hide the kinds of things that the jury would never know if it was left up to you. ' Now, is that a fair assessment, Alan? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : I would love the jury and the public to know everything about Mrs. Helmsley, all sides of her personality and her character. All we want is an open hearing ; a hearing on the new trial issue in this case. All we 're seeking is a complete disclosure of everything that went on in this case. And then if you still think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at least give us an opportunity. Talk about a high price lawyer. We have n't helped. I have n't helped. The high price doctors have n't helped. Being a wealthy woman in this country is what created the problem for Mrs. Helmsley. If she were n't as wealthy and well-known as she were, she would not have gotten a four-year sentence as a study of sentences in New York suggests @!SONYA Michael Kennedy, I mean, certainly somebody would say the doctor 's not coming back. She has to pay for the crime. Mr. KENNEDY : Of course, he 's not. Nobody regrets the death of Dr. Tarnower more than Jean Harris. No one lost more when he was killed by her than she. And no one has suffered more for it. The point is that she suffered enough. We can not return Dr. Tarnower. We can, however, have some mercy in our hearts, understand that this woman is no risk, no threat and is not about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that, let me just stop you. I was amazed today to read that the attorney who was defending the young man- the young tourist from Utah who was killed in the subway that that attorney is saying that the young boy impaled himself on the knife ; that it was not only just an accident, but in effect, it was the kid 's fault. If this kid had not walked onto the knife, he would n't be dead today. So I guess the question that many of us has is what is it with you guys? Will you use anything of in no ethics? Could you really come up and create this story when there are witnesses, a mother, a father, a sibling who may have seen what was going on? Mr. KENNEDY : That 's an example of absurd advocacy that will not do him well, will not do his client well and does n't serve the profession at all, no. What people, I think, are sick and tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what we 're about here. With Leona Helmsley, the sentence is absolutely outrageous, totally unfair, totally disproportionate to anything other than her celebrity. The celebrity status of Jean Harris is what is primarily responsible for her still being in prison. That and our governor 's absolute truculence when it comes to mercy @!SONYA Let 's go on. We 'll go to Ohio and Joe. Hello, Joe! 3rd CALLER : Ohio Hi, Sonya! I have a brief comment to make to Professor Dershowitz and then I 'll hang up to listen to his response. I can understand and appreciate that our Constitution allows everyone legal representation. I only wish as an enormous admirer of yours that the human scum of this earth like Leona Helmsley and Mike Tyson would be represented by someone else. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Well, I do n't agree with your characterization, obviously of Leona Helmsley. I 'm not commenting on any other cases. Leona Helmsley- Let me give you a story about Leona Helmsley that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtroom a couple of years ago and both of them were talking about their husbands, both of whom were very sick. My father had died of Alzheimer 's and my mother described how my father had gotten lost in the subway and could n't be found for three days. Without saying a word, Mrs. Helmsley went home that night, wrote out a check for $ 100,000 to the Alzheimer 's Foundation so that every sufferer of Alzheimer 's could have a bracelet so they would never get lost. You know, you just fall for hype when you talk about human beings as scum. Human beings are n't scum. They are decent people who suffer, who cry and who are asking for mercy in a case like this. And I think it 's an American quality, mercy. And I think a lot of people out there feel a sense of compassion about people going to jail @!SONYA Let 's stop at this point to invite our audience again to join us. 212-643-0077. Commercial break SONYA : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get a fair trial. We go to Julie in California now. Hi, Julie! 4th CALLER : California Good morning! Mr. Dershowitz, my question is for you. First of all, sir, I have a great deal of respect for you. I 've followed your career for quite a while. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Thank you. 4th CALLER : I 'm concerned about Mrs. Helmsley. It seems like the majority of the public are basing their feelings and their knowledge on little, tiny tidbits of probably false information like a made-for-TV movie. And it seems like right now, with the economy like it is, they 're looking at this as an opportunity to take a jab at the guy who has the big bucks @!SONYA Well, I would imagine you would agree with that in substance. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : You know, I do n't think there 's a person in this country that would want to change places with Mrs. Helmsley or Mr. Helmsley today. On April 15th, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing to be jealous of any more. The caller was absolutely right. There is a lot of this- SONYA : But you 're really talking about a much larger issue, Alan. And I think we have to keep that in context. And that is, should someone pay for their crimes if, indeed, they have committed a crime? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : They should pay proportionately @!SONYA And if they 're perceived as an evil or as an unkind or mean-spirited person, does that have anything to do with what goes into their sentence or if they 're male or female? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : No question about that.( A) When you 're male or female does go into your sentence. Women are disproportionately punished, treated more harshly. You know, there are no facilities really for women today that match the facilities for men in the present system. If you 're highly visible, you are discriminated against. They try to make a kind of lesson of you on April 15th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a man who was suffering grievously. And I think the people of this country when they know the whole story feel real compassion @!SONYA Let 's go to Maryland and Carl. Welcome, Carl! Carl, are you with us? 6th CALLER : Maryland Hello! SONYA : Go ahead. 6th CALLER : Yes, hi! I 'm calling from Maryland and the reason why I 'm calling is to say that you have a lot of poor people, especially like minorities, black people, that get no sort of proper legal representation. And then you always have these big shots that, you know, when they commit offenses, that 's supposed to be forgiven. How about the poor people? SONYA : Michael Kennedy? Mr. KENNEDY : I agree. How about the poor people? The fact of the matter is that poor people are not getting a fair shake in the criminal justice system either. Not only because they 're not able to afford counsel, but also because they frequently do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to press for them. But the reality is that it is probably easier in this day of overwhelming news coverage. It is probably easier for a person without celebrity status to get a fair trial than it is for one with celebrity status @!SONYA Let me just ask you a question about the issue of fair trial. I mean, is n't it true that in many ways that the media is exposing deep, dark secrets that you guys would be protecting? I mean, you 're a father figure there. That 's what you 're there for. You 're there to give a rationale, to protect this person, to offer up a defense. The media comes in and the media is, unfortunately, always seen as the bad guy, it seems to me from whichever point of view you look at something and says, ' But here 's something you did n't tell. ' I mean, for example, before the show, we got a phone call, Alan. And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helmsley palace, ' We have been told to call this show when it goes on the air and say good things about Mrs. Helmsley. ' And, indeed, we have gotten 11 calls prior to the show going on the air each of which said something nice. Now, we did n't say, ' Are you an employee?, ' and I do n't know if the call indeed came from an employee. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Well, there has been a lot of spontaneous support from the employees. You know, there are 35,000 people that the Helmsleys employ. There have been a few over the years that were fired. They were the ones who testified against Mrs. Helmsley at the trial. But there is tremendous and enthusiastic support from among people who do n't want to lose their jobs if the Helmsley empire were to collapse who love Mrs. Helmsley. She 's done a tremendous amount to help people with medical problems, people with other kinds of problems. She has supported New York Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charity. So there are people out there who are trying to drum up support for her but it 's all spontaneous. People feel terrible about the fact that Mrs. Helmsley, after what she 's done for the city of New York and what Harry Helmsley has done for the city of New York are being told to end their life that way. You ca n't complain when people do that @!SONYA And do people feel the same way about Jean Harris? And if so, why does n't that seem to do anything to change what 's occurring? Mr. KENNEDY : Well, the public support for Jean Harris has been really tremendous. There have been over 15,000 letters gone to the governor unsolicited from all over the country saying, ' Why keep her in? What possible good is there to spend between $ 25- and $ 40,000 a year to warehouse this extraordinary woman who is no threat to society whatsoever? ' SONYA : Let 's stop here and take some more calls from our audience. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SONYA : Welcome back! We 're going to continue our discussion about famous defendants in just a moment. First, we 're going to go to the financial news desk and here 's Myron Kandel. Financial News SONYA : And we 're talking about famous defendants and whether or not they can get a fair trial. We 'll go to Joan in New York next. Hi, Joan! 7th CALLER : New York Hi, hello, Sonya! SONYA : Yes. 7th CALLER : I 'm speaking not only for myself but for a lot of people. If there was an error in the taxes that Mrs. Helmsley paid, let them correct it. But she 's not John Gotti and I think she 's lost her dignity and her- SONYA : Well, I 'm not sure- Frankly, I find this a very surprising comment only because what does it mean, ' She 's not John Gotti '? Unless the caller meant to say John Gotti may or may not, we do n't know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is not and there 's no need to put her in that kind of a setting. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Every case is different. Every case is different, but the important thing about Mrs. Helmsley is every nickel was earned legitimately and the government concedes that. The people who go to jail for tax violations generally are people who fail to report illegally earned income. I think that may have been the reference to at least an allegation in that case. And in the Helmsley case, every penny was earned legitimately, and when they first learned that there was even an inkling of suspicion, Harry Helmsley wrote out a blank check, gave it to his accountant, said, ' Here. Go to the IRS. If they think we owe them anything, fill in the amount, then we can litigate about it later. ' That 's the way taxes are generally settled. You know, the tax laws are so complicated. The Supreme Court today granted review in a case about whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduction. It still is not resolved and yet that 's what they 're putting Mrs. Helmsley in jail for, because items taken from Dinelle and Hold sp? are home which was used for business entertainment were taken as business rev and personal expenses @!SONYA Michael, we had a reference to John Gotti. Can a guy like John Gotti get a fair trial? Mr. KENNEDY : Very unlikely. Very unlikely, primarily because not only has the judge taken away from John Gotti his lawyer and most effective advocate, Mr. Cutler, but he 's also deprived him of bail, pre-trial, which does n't seem to me to make a whole lot of sense with all due respect to the judge, because Mr. Gotti is n't going to flee anywhere. And, in fact, he 's a danger to the community, he has access to the phone. So putting him in jail gives a public perception that he 's being treated differently and that 's the fundamental problem. He is being treated differently. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not anonymous from the government. They know the government knows who they are. And, therefore, every effort that can be made has been made to convict John Gotti. That 's not what it 's supposed to be about @!SONYA Let 's go to Iowa and Jean. Hi, Jean! 8th CALLER : Iowa Yes, I have a question for Mr. Dershowitz. Are you still representing Jim Bakker? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : I represented Jim Bakker on the appeal from his sentence, an excessive sentence, 45 years. United States Court of Appeals agreed and reversed the sentence and sent it back to a different judge for different sentencing. I 'm no longer involved in the case at this point @!SONYA Let me ask you about the role of politics. Mike Kennedy mentioned something about the governor of the state and Jean Harris. I believe that you have some feelings about Rudy Guliani and your particular case. Do you? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Well, Rudy 's an old friend of mine, and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DERSHOWITZ : We 've been on the other side of- But, I think a decision was made to give immunity to the accountants in this case who are the real culprits and to get a big fish, somebody very visible and indict her on April 14th with a big press conference and then try to send her to jail on April 15th. I think there were political ramifications to this case. Prosecutors run for higher office if they can get very prominent people and convict them @!SONYA Now, I love the style that both of you have. I note that when you speak, you say ' The accountants, the real culprits. ' I mean, I hear you in my head arguing in front of a jury or a judge and I know just by listening to you hear, I have a sense of how you would do that. How is someone supposed to decide? You know, as I look at the two of you distinguished, very bright, attractive men who can articulate better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not this person 's really guilty if I were on the jury and did believe in justice not just points of law and had no axe to grind? What would you recommend? Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Well, first of all, you have to hear both sides of the story. Next time, bring prosecutors of Mrs. Helmsley here. Let 's debate the issue in public with both sides of the story. All we 're asking for in the Helmsley case is an opportunity for a new trial, an opportunity to present all the evidence including the evidence that was suppressed @!SONYA Mr. Kennedy? Mr. KENNEDY : The difficulty, I think, is that we have to come up with imaginative ways of sentencing and punishing people. We now have over a million people in prison in the United States ; more than any country on earth. And most of them probably would be able to function very well. We have to find alternatives. We have to take someone of extraordinary resources of Mrs. Helmsley and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society. Jean Harris ought to be out making a contribution to society. It 's absurd for us to be spending our money warehousing these women @!SONYA Well, gentlemen, you 're both very interesting men. I 'm pleased to know that you take a number of cases either pro bono or with minimum and sliding fees. I think we should tell the audience that. And if I ever get into trouble, you guys are it. Thanks for being with us today. Mr. DERSHOWITZ : Thank you. Mr. KENNEDY : Thank you @!SONYA When we return, is it really Japan bashing to say, ' Buy American '? And what does ' Made in the USA ' really mean? We 'll find out. That 's next. Commercial break Made in America SONYA : Take a look at the label inside of your shirt. Does it say, ' Made in America '? Well, it might, but does that really mean that it was made in the good old USofA? Not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor is n't that easy leaving many Americans who are trying to buy American in the lurch. June Collier says that that 's because our country has lost it 's edge to the Japanese. She is president of Citizens Against Foreign Control of America. Journalist Phil Patton is with us, too. He contends that Americans should n't focus on where they have fallen behind but concentrate instead on what they do well. He writes the Design column for Esquire Magazine and is the author of the new book Made in USA. And joining us from Washington is Seiichiro Noboru. He is the minister of economics at the Japanese Embassy to the United States. Welcome to all of you. June Collier, I would like to start with you. You feel that we are losing our competitive edge, and if you do, why? JUNE COLLIER, Citizen 's Against Foreign Control : Well, I do n't think we 're losing it. I think we 've already lost it. We did n't lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!SONYA Well, when you say that, explain more and what does Japan have to do with it? Ms. COLLIER : Well, Japan is probably the biggest- Well, as we know, they 're the biggest exporter of goods in this country. It 's the country with the largest trade deficit with our country. It has subsidized, you know, head industries here. It is just the one that has targeted the American market and they 're going to take it @!SONYA But as I listen to you, I say to myself, ' What about good old American ingenuity? And so what if there 's somebody else competing? ' We 're the ones where we say, ' Go for number one. ' We 're the ones who are out here trying to do the best, make the best products, are n't we? Ms. COLLIER : There is no doubt about it. Americans are, I mean, they 're a wonderful group of people. They do say, ' Go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concrete building down with your head, and that 's what we 're trying to do. We can not do that. It 's getting to the point where, I mean, you just can not compete in any way @!SONYA Now, what is it you 'd like to have us do? Ms. COLLIER : Well, the problem we have today is twofold. One of them is goods coming into this country whether it be from Japan, whether it be from a third world nation, or whoever it may be, should have- Rather than saying tariff, I 'm going to say market access fee, you know, pay for the use of our market. It 's the largest market in the world. It is the world market. The second thing is that anyone that is not a citizen of this country should not be able to buy property and tangible assets. They should n't be able to buy anything they ca n't take home with them. If you ca n't work in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory or a farm @!SONYA Mr. Noboru, how do you feel about what you 've just heard? SEIICHIRO NOBORU, Japanese Embassy : You have to take into account the fact that the economies of the country is so intertwined. It is not easy to distinguish what is made in America and what is not made in America. And moreover, the countries are so interdependent and you have to realize the fact that American business are very well established in Japan and they own a lot of the properties and buildings, and they are manufacturing more than 55 billion dollars ; a lot more than this country 's actually exporting @!SONYA Mr. Noboru, let me stop you for just a moment. We must go back to Lou Waters in Atlanta. We 'll be back with you in a moment. Lou? CNN Breaking News with Lou Waters SONYA : We 're talking about ' Buy American ' and what ' Made in USA ' really means. Let 's go to Phil Patton right now. You 've heard some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks about keep nationals from other countries out of buying our real estate and really out of the manufacturing and taking over our country. That was one point of view. And then Mr. Noboru who says very clearly we are so intertwined. This is a global community today. So let me ask you having done a study about things that are made in USA. Is it where the idea comes from, where the technology comes from, where it is manufactured, where it is sold? What does it mean when you have that label? PHIL PATTON, Journalist : Well, I think we 've forgotten a lot of the history of the things that have made it successful in the past. And if you look back at some of the people who really made great American products, they 've been people who 've been interested in making good things, first of all, before any kind of quarterly reports. They 've been people who 've been interested in changing lives whether it 's Henry Ford enabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picnic or George Eastman producing the Brownie camera to take a picture of that picnic. And that spirit is not gone. We simply have to work harder at getting the technology into the products @!SONYA Yeah, but June Collier is worried about jobs. I mean, let 's be straight about what 's happening in this economy in this country right now. Should all manufacturing of products sold here be done here? Let it be designed in Japan and manufactured, assembled and sold here. Mr. PATTON : We ca n't go back to the days of borders among countries. Every company that 's successful today has to be global. Ford Motor Company would not be with us today most likely if it had not European operations in the early ' 80s @!SONYA Let me go to June Collier and ask a question. June Collier, I understand that while we here in America may have some difficulty with Japanese cars, that France was not happy taking some of our cars because they, in effect, had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ' Wait a minute. These are American cars. ' Now, we ca n't have it two ways. Ms. COLLIER : Well, I do n't think we have to worry about having it two ways and I do n't think we should tell France what to do, you know. France should be able to manage their own economy and we should be able to manage ours. And I'm- SONYA : Well, then how do you feel about Lee Iacocca who reportedly uses more Japanese parts in the Chrysler as he talks about buying American? How do you start to distinguish all of that? Ms. COLLIER : Well, Sonya, let me just say that I was in the manufacture of automotive components for almost 30 years. So I know about the automotives. You could take all the foreign components off an American car and you would n't have enough left to fill up a parking place. That 's why- SONYA : Now, having said that- Ms. COLLIER : -a tariff or a market access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans of jobs. I think all Americans should have a job and I think they ought to work or they ought to go hungry. We do have- SONYA : All right. Now, we 'll get to Mr. Noboru in just a moment. I want to go to Kip in Iowa first. Hi, Kip! 1st CALLER : Iowa Hi! I 'm getting tired of the Japan bashing playing out. I think it 's wrong to punish a country or attempts to punish a country because they happen to be a wily and productive society and to see- One of the most ludicrous things I saw this year was our President Bush not only going to Australia on his tour and flipping their country off, basically, is what he did from his limo, then going to Japan and vomiting on Japan and then taking- SONYA : Well, I think that 's a really inappropriate and inaccurate representation of what occurred that day. So let 's just stay with the first part of your comments, if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your knowledge, is there a plan to take over the manufacturing, in fact, the entire industrial base of this country? And if not, what do you buy that 's American and what do you want? Mr. NOBORU : Absolutely, I deny that. There is no truth in that what 's been said just commented by you and the kinds of things mentioned by unintelligible. Well, the United States and Japan are the great partners. We unintelligible to number one and number two countries in the world economy. We must compete with each other and that competition makes the economy of two countries stronger. And so if you try to be isolationistic, that will only end up in the making of the economy very small. Right now, the U.S. economy grows, but nearly 50 percent of the economy growth comes from U.S. exports. And if you try to maintain the posture of isolationism, then what is going to happen to those American exports which have been the really unintelligible power, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. economy @!SONYA Let me stop you if I may, please. We 're going to go to Matt in New Jersey. Hi, Matt! 2nd CALLER : New Jersey Hi, how are you doing. My question is for the guy in Washington @!SONYA Go ahead. Mr. NOBORU : Yes. 2nd CALLER : My question is, if you have all- If the Japanese have all this money to buy all this property in the United States, then why do n't they have the money to pay off the debts that they owe us? Mr. NOBORU : We are not trying to buy your property or anything. We are trying to increase the investment in this country partly because the Japanese business is asked by the American local industries, local companies and local residents to invest and create jobs. We have so far created more than 500,000 jobs by investing in this country and we have been contributing about 8 or 9 percent of American exports, done by the Japanese related business @!SONYA June Collier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some kind of a tariff, and I understand that is a part of the platform that you are describing here. What about the fact that the Consumer Reports comes out and takes a look at the ' 92 cars and says, indeed, that the Japanese cars are better in terms of safety and performance and reliability? Is that an objective source or are we supposed to feel that somebody is buying them off, too? Ms. COLLIER : I would n't be surprised. I mean, I think probably our Congress- many of our Congressmen have been bought off by the Japanese. And I want to correct something that the gentleman from Washington just said. You know, we keep using this term, ' investment. ' We throw that around. It 's like a big, important word to impress people and it does impress people ' cause it confuses them. When Japan invests in this country, invest means one thing. It means buying. And when you buy, you control. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, the people should speak. They should speak to their elected representative. Now, back to the- SONYA : Now, Phil Patton, let me ask you, in terms of what was just said. Is that something that you feel we have to worry about? Mr. PATTON : Well, I think we have to understand the total picture. For instance, the world 's largest television factory is in Bloomington, Indiana. It 's an RCA factory. It 's owned as of the last two or three years by Thompson in France. The products that are turned out are superb. They 're made by American workers, designed by American designers and they 're right up there in the consumer- SONYA : But who owns the building? Who owns the real estate? That 's really what June is talking about. Ms. COLLIER : Where does the profits go? Mr. PATTON : But the profits go not only to France, they go to the American designers, they go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole economy. And the product is in every way of personality an American product @!SONYA June, I 'm going to give you an opportunity to tell us what you think we ought to do. The tariff and? Ms. COLLIER : I think that we should have- Let 's not call it tariff. That seems like a dirty word. Let 's call it a market access fee. To come into play in our market, let them pay. They have vast profits @!SONYA Mr. Noboru, how do you feel about that? Is that fair and would that be more reciprocal in terms of a variety of the trade laws in Japan? Mr. NOBORU : Well, we have to be- Since we are mutually interdependent, we must open our market. We must keep our markets open to everybody. That is the only and best way for the overall prosperity of the world. Ms. COLLIER : Excuse me. But the Japanese economy is based on protectionism, one hundred percent protectionism. Mr. NOBORU : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, Ms. Collier, how much we are importing from this country? We are importing more than the United States, Germany and Italy are importing combined from the United States. Ms. COLLIER : I understand. I know what you do. You import from the United States, add value to it, and you send it back to us @!SONYA Clearly, this is a controversy we 're not going to solve today, ladies and gentlemen, and so, therefore, we have given all of us an opportunity to hear a variety of points of view. We 'll have to decide for ourselves which one we believe in. Thanks again. We 'll be right back. Commercial break SONYA : Thank you for joining me today. Tomorrow, you want to do a little research for us? Go out and see Basic Instincts just for research and then we can talk together about what it really means to be bi-sexual. That 's what we 're going to talk about tomorrow. We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your comments. We 'll also take a look at how anger affects your health. Have a good rest of the day. And now for a look at what 's ahead on Newsday. Let 's go to Sharyl Attkisson in Atlanta. SHARYL ATTKISSON, ' Newsday ' : Sonya, coming up, we will have details on the hotel fire at the Intercontinental in Amman, Jordan. We also hope to have a phone report from the scene next on Newsday.
