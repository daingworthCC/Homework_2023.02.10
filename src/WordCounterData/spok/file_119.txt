239041 CATHY MARSHALL, Anchor : Republican Senator Dan Coats is conducting the questioning now at the confirmation hearings for Joycelyn Elders. His line of questioning focusing on paying Social Security for some household help. Dr. JOYCELYN ELDERS, Surgeon General Nominee : in progress -was already at work. She left before I got home. So, you know- Sen. DAN COATS,( R-IN) : If there was a- If you were going to travel at a different time or leave early or leave later- Dr. ELDERS : Senators, I 've caught planes at 6:45 in the morning- Sen. COATS : So, you- Dr. ELDERS : I would get my mother-in-law up, bathe her, feed her- Sen. COATS : I understand that. Dr. ELDERS : -and put her in the chair, because the most important thing for me was that she was very comfortable. Sen. COATS : I understand that, Dr. Elders. Dr. ELDERS : This was a woman who, when my children were very small and I was having to work very long, hard hours, and especially during the summer, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month in order- and take them to Disney World and, you know, to places. And every summer, she devoted- you know, she would keep these, my children, for a month with me- Sen. COATS : No, Dr. Elders- Dr. ELDERS : So now- Sen. COATS : I understand that. Dr. ELDERS : -I do n't have any problems taking care of her. Yes, when I left at 6 o'clock in the morning. Sen. COATS : You misunderstand my question, Dr. Elders- Dr. ELDERS : Oh, I 'm sorry. Sen. COATS : I perhaps did n't state it clearly. Dr. ELDERS : Oh, I 'm sorry, I thought you said when I was going- Sen. COATS : I think it 's very admirable what you did, and I can appreciate the difficulty of doing that, and I 'm trying- Dr. ELDERS : I never considered it a difficulty, Senator. I felt that I was doing- Sen. COATS : I 'm trying to be sympathetic. Dr. ELDERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. laughter VOICE IN BACKGROUND : She does n't need it, is what she 's telling you. Dr. ELDERS : I 'm telling you that this is something I 've done with pride because she did it for me. Sen. COATS : My question was it in your- could you have called up Audrey Ruffin sp? and said, Audrey, I have to leave at 6:45, could you come earlier today or tomorrow? Were you able to do that or were you- did you do that? Dr. ELDERS : Now that I 'm here, Senator, and my husband is here too, Audrey Ruffin is taking care of my mother-in-law. Sen. COATS : I understand that, but my question is who made the arrangements for Audrey Ruffin in terms of what time she would show up for work, how long she would have to stay? Dr. ELDERS : That had really been prearranged by father-in-law. She always looked good. She was always well taken care of. So I did n't see her. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay, let me go on to another question. I 'm not able to state that with sufficient clarity. Did Audrey Ruffin ever live with you? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. Sen. COATS : Did she- Was she, excuse me, was she paid by checks drawn from your joint checking account with your husband? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. COATS : Have you ever signed a check or made payments to Audrey Ruffin for services she received? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. COATS : Have you ever signed a check or made payments for services rendered to, keeps clearing throat, excuse me - Maybe it 's divine intervention. Maybe I 'm not supposed to ask these questions. Now, is Leona Elders sp? your mother pause -in-law? Dr. ELDERS : No. Yes, sir. She is my mother-in-law. She 's not my mother. Sen. COATS : All right. Is it true that Social Security and unemployment taxes were not withheld from Ms. Ruffin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's correct. Sen. COATS : Were federal and state taxes withheld from her salary? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. Sen. COATS : Did either you or your husband consult with a lawyer or tax expert regarding your mother-in-law taking a deduction for services which she did not pay? Did you ever contact a lawyer or financial consultant or banker to- I 'm trying to understand what the arrangements were. Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. I was, Senator- Sen. COATS : I 'm not commenting on whether this is- Dr. ELDERS : Well, I 'm saying.? : Restate it, Dan, just so that we- I 'm just trying to follow it myself, just so that- Sen. COATS : Did either you or your husband consult with a lawyer or a tax expert regarding your mother-in-law taking a deduction for services for which she did not pay? In other words, on your mother-in-law 's return, did you consult with a lawyer about your mother-in-law 's taxes to see whether she was taking- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. This was- Sen. COATS : Or any other deduction? Dr. ELDERS : Our tax accountant handled that, and this was- Sen. COATS : You did n't raise the question with him? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. Sen. COATS : When did you realize that what was done here was a violation of the law, in terms of not paying the taxes? Dr. ELDERS : Senator, I guess even today, I do n't feel that it was a violation of the law in regard to me, but, you know, I think it was an error that was made- Sen. COATS : Well, the law, whether we agree- Whether we agree with the law or not, the law states that it 's a violation. Did you at some point realize that it was a violation of the law as written? Dr. ELDERS : Well, I guess, the past few weeks, I guess I did. When we found- and we paid it, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think, for me. Sen. COATS : But you did, at some point, realize that the law had been violated relative to the taxes and Social Security? Dr. ELDERS : Yes. Sen. COATS : As a director of a state Health Department, were you familiar with the practices, procedures for hiring private nurses? Did you- Dr. ELDERS : Well, I was- Senator, I was not- I did not get into all of the details of personnel policy at the Department of Health. Sen. COATS : So you were not aware then that private nurses, there were certain legal responsibilities relative to tax payments? Dr. ELDERS : Senator, it was my understanding, and this had been some of our understanding in regard to this, that, you know, like private duty nurses really are independent consultants or independent- Sen. COATS : Contractors. Dr. ELDERS : -contractors, and they handle their own- You know, you pay them a fixed amount and- Sen. COATS : Your husband, when asked why he failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't afford to pay them. Yet, there 's been a lot written about your salary and your husband 's combined salary with yours. Is that an accurate statement? How could- Is that a fact that you could not afford to pay the taxes on the nurse hired? Dr. ELDERS : Senator, I would not like to answer in regard to what was said that my husband said, because, you know, I did n't hear him make that statement. Sen. COATS : Could I hear your opinion as to whether or not you though you and your husband had sufficient income to pay the taxes? Dr. ELDERS : I 'm sure, Senator, we would have. You always have sufficient income to do what you have to do. Sen. COATS : Well, I guess my question goes to whether or not you thought you were supposed to pay the taxes or you thought that you just did n't have enough money to pay the taxes? Dr. ELDERS : Senator, this was, again- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen, I can- Sen. EDWARD KENNEDY,( D-MA), Chairman, Labor and Human Resources Committee : Let her on, sir. She 's trying to answer. Sen. COATS : Well, maybe it was n't answering the question I asked, but I 'll be patient. Sen. KENNEDY : unintelligible -give any answer, if you- Sen. COATS : I 'm sorry, Dr. Elders, I did n't mean to interrupt. Dr. ELDERS : Well, I guess, I was- what I was really saying is these were really my mother-in-law 's taxes. There is my husband and he has two sisters. Our agreement was he would take care of what needed to be done with his parents. You know, I was not involved in their financial affairs. His mother-in-law had funds that I know that we paid Ms. Ruffin. So, you know, I just- you know, I was not involved in their day-to-day affairs. Sir, I was- Maybe, I should have, but I was n't. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important thing that I had to do was to provide the best possible health care that I could for my mother-in-law. Sen. COATS : Dr. Elders- Mr. Chairman, I should inquire how much time I have left in this round, because I have another series of questions. I do n't want to start if I 'm going to run out of time halfway through. Sen. KENNEDY : One minute. Sen. COATS : One minute. Well, I ca n't make it through the series of questions then. I 'll wait for the second round. Sen. KENNEDY : If Senator Metzebaum would you just yield a few moments on the Social Security. Now, as I understand, 1985 Leona Elders executes a power of attorney in favor of her son Oliver Elders, is that right? That 's your mother-in-law? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir, that 's correct. Sen. KENNEDY : Now your mother-in-law and your father-in-law came to live in your home? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Now, due to- They had established a relationship with Audrey Ruffin, or at least initially, is that correct? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Now, due to the failing health of Mr. Elders and Leona Elders, move into the home with you and your husband. Now, in the summer of ' 88, O.B. Elders, that 's your father-in-law, hires to care for his wife, who is suffering from Alzheimer 's Disease, and Mr. Elders arranges to pay Ms. Ruffin without Social Security taxes, and shortly thereafter O.B. Elders dies, is that right? Dr. ELDERS : That 's correct, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Now, from ' 88 to ' 93, your husband continues to employ Audrey Ruffin under the same conditions as his father had employed her, and Audrey Ruffin is paid from Leona Elders ' funds. Dr. ELDERS : That 's correct, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : So there is, the funds that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. ELDERS : That 's correct. Sen. KENNEDY : That you husband had access to, and they used those funds to pay for this attendant. Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Now, when you signed checks, you signed the checks from that amount of money, even though it 's a joint account, that amount of money that belonged to your mother-in-law, is that right? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : And then Oliver Elders acknowledges that he was obligated to withhold the Social Security. This is your husband. Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : It 's your husband 's parents. You love them as family, but it 's your husband 's parents. Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : And he acknowledged that he was obligated with- Well, I love my wife 's parents too, I just want to make- laughter They 're out there watching. I can feel a certain tension coming back here at my question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicky sees this- Oliver Elders now acknowledges that he was obligated to withhold the Social Security, and then he pays approximately $ 15,000 backtaxes to the IRS. Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Okay. You never took any kind of deduction in your taxes, to the best of your knowledge? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. Sen. KENNEDY : Well, not even the best- You did n't take any? Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. They were- You know, she filed- Her taxes were filed as Leona Elders every year. Sen. KENNEDY : But you never took any. Dr. ELDERS : No, sir. Sen. COATS : You and your husband file a joint return? Dr. ELDERS : Yes, sir. Sen. COATS : Well, did that tax return reflect any deductions that were taken? Dr. ELDERS : Not for Leona Elders. Sen. COATS : There were no deductions taken for Leona Elders on the joint return filed by you and your husband? Dr. ELDERS : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that, I think is- I think the- We have other questions, but I 'll come back to them. I yield the remaining time, Senator @!MARSHALL We 're going to take a short break in our coverage, but when we come back, we 'll have more of the confirmation hearings for Dr. Joycelyn Elders. Stay with us. Commercial break MARSHALL : Senator Howard Metzenbaum has now taken over the questioning. He told Dr. Elders that he believes in her financial integrity - the Social Security issue not a problem for him. He 's now moved on to why she wants to be surgeon general. Sen. HOWARD METZENBAUM,( D-OH) : in progress -everybody has to stand up and salute you for having made the effort. There are some things that you ca n't do that much of. Then I read some articles in the paper about the availability of condoms and the fact that some of the condoms were defective, and whether you should have gone public or should n't have. I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure. But I 'm interested in the health of the people of this country, and for myself, I 'm satisfied that you 're a breath of fresh air. You 're going to come in and do that job. You 're going to get confirmed, and you 're going to get confirmed by and overwhelming vote, and I think you 're going to do a fantastic job for the health care needs of this country. Some right-wing groups are going to be unhappy because you 're aggressive in speaking out about some of these issues having to do with sex, having to do with venereal diseases, having to do with certain other issues of that kind, but that 's their problem. I think that you 're going to do a fantastic job, and I 'm just so pleased that I 've had the privilege of meeting you here today - I never had that privilege before - and I wish you well. Dr. ELDERS : Thank you, Senator. I 'll do the very best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to you. Sen. CHRISTOPHER DODD,( D-CT) : Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would just as unanimous consent that some formal remarks be included in the record and to welcome you once again to the committee. I just would point out, Mr. Chairman and my colleagues here - I had never met you before the opportunity came by the office, and I 'm pleased that you took the time to visit. But I always think a pretty good test when a case like this arrives is to go back to one 's neighbors, coworkers, friends or other people that may have known you. Not that it 's necessarily an absolute test, but it 's a pretty good one, generally speaking. I 'm always a little bit cautious about endorsing people who have n't been endorsed by people that they 've worked with in the past and know them. And for those who may not know you well and are only becoming familiar with your views in this setting, I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 organizations in the state of Arkansas - it 's not a big state - 100 organizations in Arkansas is a lot of organizations - have endorsed your candidacy, including such radical groups as the Parent Teachers Association of Arkansas laughter, the American Medical Association. I asked my commissioner and former commissioners in the state of Connecticut who know you, neither of whom are the same political parties, strongly endorse your candidacy. The medical societies of your state, and the list goes on and on. I think that is a very worthwhile piece of information in trying to make judgments based on the six years, or almost six years, of your work in the most recent position you 've had and your previous involvement. So for those who may be trying to make a judgment call as to whether or not you 're competent or qualified- And I suspect that every one of these organizations who have endorsed you did not agree with everything you did or every word you 've spoken. I 've read a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty with some of the ways you 've articulated some views, but that 's not the issue really. I think what is important is whether or not you 've demonstrated the kind of leadership and involvement and forthrightness that is critical in this job. I took the floor a week or so ago on your behalf. After I had met you and talked to you and decided early on, I wanted to express my strong views, and I said at that time that- We do n't like to admit mistakes up here. Senators are really dreadful at admitting that we 've cast votes that we 'd like to have back, and there have been a few in my 12 years I 'd like to have back, and one of them is the vote on Dr. C. Everett Koop. I voted against him, and I regret it, because he turned out to be one fine surgeon general. Dr. ELDERS : Yes. Sen. DODD : And one of the reasons I got to like him so much, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked his forthrightness, I liked the fact that he did n't mince words. And he laid out issues before this committee and the Congress and the American public that we had to come to terms with, and he ended up being a terrific leader on these issues. And not that you 're going to necessarily follow a similar path on views, but that same forthrightness, I think, is critical. And you 've, of course, raised- You 're told you 're a radical and dangerous individual, and I look down and I see where you care about teenage pregnancy and substance abuse - and those are radical ideas. In a sense, they are, maybe, in a true sense of the word, radical in the sense that we 've been ducking them for a long time, and maybe we need to come to terms with them and should have a long time ago. And the fact that you, the state of Arkansas, brought them up, I think, is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them radical. So, I welcome your nomination. I think the president made a terrific choice. I 'm glad you excepted the challenge. I 'm sorry you had to go through some of this, but that 's what people have to do, but it 's worth it, in my view, in the end. The American people, I think, are going to come to know you, respect you. I think your statement this morning was tremendous, and I 'm confident you 'll do an excellent job. Now let me- because I made the offer earlier to the chairman, if you want to get back into some of these other lines of question, I 'll yield time to you to complete that cycle, if that 's what you 'd care to do, Mr. Chairman. Sen. KENNEDY : Well, I would. I 'd like to do that if it's- Sen. DODD : I 'll do that, reserve- Sen. KENNEDY : -agreeable, and just take- There are still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Senator Christopher Dodd basically giving his endorsement of the Elders nomination. The confirmation hearings will continue after a news update at the top of the hour. Commercial break
