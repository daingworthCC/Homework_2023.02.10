234741 MATT @!LAUER, co-host : Just last month, attorneys for the parents of victims of the high school shooting in Paducah, Kentucky, filed a $ 130 million lawsuit alleging that several video games, including Mortal Combat and the movie " The Basketball Diaries " inspired Michael Carneal to kill three of his classmates and wound five others. One week later, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold gunned down 12 classmates and a teacher. And while there 's no direct connection between the killings, there is ongoing debate about the influence of video games and movies on our children. The film " The Basketball Diaries " is based on the memoirs of bohemian poet Jim Carroll. This is his first television interview since the the shootings. Jim, thank you for being here. I know you do n't like to do interviews, so I appreciate it very much. @!Mr-JIM-CARROLL-@1 " : Yes, I 'm a little trepidatious about it, but... @!LAUER : I can imagine. But what was your first reaction, Jim, when you heard the connection being made between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-CARROLL : Well, I got calls from my publisher and my literary agent about all these news people, CNN and -- wanting to speak to me. Because apparently, it is the first thing the kid said after, you know, days -- the guys said, ' What made you do this? ' He said, ' I saw " The Basketball Diaries, " and Jim Carroll ' -- he did n't even say Leonardo DiCaprio, he said Jim Carroll. And it just -- you know, so I did n't see it on the news first, I -- I heard it from -- I finally called up my agent, and they told me about it. And we just issued a statement then, because I did n't want to do any interviews about it and stuff. But... @!LAUER : But what was your reaction? @!Mr-CARROLL : It... @!LAUER : I mean, when you heard the two items being connected? @!Mr-CARROLL : It was totally surreal. The only thing that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died to me. And -- and I respected that very much, and -- but I could not see how that scene isolated in that movie, which I get -- that movie, I mean, has enabled so many kids to read that book, and I get so many letters from kids that same age, and it just gives them so much hope, that it was a book about you being an outsider, and -- and surviving it. And if you got through it, then I can get through it, ' you know. @!LAUER : So you 've been hearing all these years, since 1979 it was published, the positive side of the impact? @!Mr-CARROLL : The exact opposite. And especially since the movie, which -- the movie, to tell you the truth, I -- on aesthetic reasons, I did n't think -- I thought it was an OK movie, the -- the portrayals were great by the actors, but it did n't have that much to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't have much impact, then... @!Mr-CARROLL : No. @!LAUER :... on the movie? @!Mr-CARROLL : No, I didn't. @!LAUER : Let me play you a tape here. This is something Jack Thompson said. He 's the attorney representing the families in Paducah. OK? @!Mr-JACK-THOMPSON-@ : In some people 's minds, Jim Carroll 's " Basketball Diaries " will be presumed to be somewhat responsible for what happened in Paducah, Kentucky, and maybe in Colorado at Columbine High School, as well. @!LAUER : You 're a writer, and all of a sudden, tragedy occurs in this nation, and the finger -- I mean, it 's your name, Jim Carroll -- the fingers are pointed at you. @!Mr-CARROLL : Well, I think it 's -- it 's surreal, like I said, but it 's also ridiculous. I mean, these people have to understand that artists have to use -- you ca n't just take these things out of context and just always point the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be " Catcher in the Rye " which they found on Chapman after he shot Lennon. @!LAUER : Mark David Chapman. @!Mr-CARROLL : Yes. There would n't be Beatles songs because of Manson 's use of " Helter Skelter. " I mean, come on. I remember seeing " White Heat " when I was a kid, top of the world, and blowing up everything, James Cagney. But the thing is, I mean for me to feel that way when it 's really -- I mean, a writer has to use evil and, I mean, evil to illuminate goodness, and goodness to illuminate evil. @!LAUER : As a matter of fact, in the book -- in the movie, this is a dream sequence. Leonardo... @!Mr-CARROLL : It 's a dream sequence. @!LAUER :... DiCaprio walks in and shoots a teacher and students. In your book, how did you handle the same element of the story? @!Mr-CARROLL : I -- completely different. It 's not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that out of boredom, some days I just want to take a machine gun and rattle the blackboard and the ceiling with -- with it. I do n't want... @!LAUER : But it was a fantasy. @!Mr-CARROLL : I say I do n't want to hit anybody, I do n't want to shoot anybody, I just want to riddle it. And it was a fantasy. @!LAUER : Let 's do this. Let 's watch the tape from the movie from the scene as I read the excerpt of your book, and then I 'll ask you to comment on the other side. Here 's what you write in the book, ' It 's just that I get this complete urge to suddenly take a machine gun and start firing like mad toward my right side. Not at anyone or anything, unless they got in the way, but that would n't matter much, because I would aim fairly high. Just do that for a few seconds, like one whole round, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I guess it would just release some tension. ' Now why do you think, though, that that 's a different message from what we 're seeing Leonardo DiCaprio doing in the movie? @!Mr-CARROLL : Because film is -- is a different medium, I suppose. And when I first saw this scene, I thought it was a little over the top and kind of corny, to tell you the truth. It 's " Terminator, " smoke in the back and all that. @!LAUER : Slow motion. @!Mr-CARROLL : Yes, the slow -- I do n't like slow motion in films. I mean, real-life violence is fast, chaotic, and I do n't like using slow motion to portray violence. @!LAUER : So in your mind, you ca n't imagine a young person seeing that scene from " The Basketball Diaries " and then going out and duplicating it in life? @!Mr-CARROLL : Not -- certainly not in the context of the rest of -- if you read the book, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or even if they saw the rest of the movie, because the movie, as well as the book, is about an ultimate redemption. It 's -- and in connection with Colorado, it 's strange, because in the book I went from being a jock, my life was consumed by basketball, I was all-city until, like, I was a sophomore, then I got interested in poetry, and that changed my life. And then I went on and poetry really gave me an identity, and that kind of redeemed me by the end of the book. The last line is, ' I just want to be pure. ' And I think that 's the biggest problem today. I had -- when I said ' I want to be a poet, ' I could n't tell anybody in the neighborhood, because it meant you were a sissy. Kids ca n't cry today. When Michael Carneal had this depression, he could n't go tell anybody because it would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't think that someone would go out and mimic the scene from the movie or even the fantasy from the book, is it possible that it 's a contributing factor? Again, Jack Thompson is the lawyer for the families in Paducah. Here 's something else he had to say. @!Mr-THOMPSON : Any child who sees and saw " The Basketball Diaries " does n't become a mass murderer like Michael Carneal. But, indeed, the pediatric forensic psychiatrist who analyzed Michael Carneal in the criminal proceeding concluded that this movie, this specific movie, contributed to Michael Carneal 's spiraling descent into depression. @!LAUER : Contributed to his " spiraling descent into depression. " @!Mr-CARROLL : The key words there, " spiraling descent. " At what point did he see " The Basketball Diaries "? And why did n't he get help? Because he was afraid. You ca n't show that vulnerability as a boy in America when you 're depressed. He could n't tell his parents about it. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. ' Shake it off, ' your parents would tell you, as if it 's an ankle injury. ' Play through the pain. ' But, if he -- at a certain point, he could have -- a girl could have turned him down for a date. It could... @!LAUER : And that could have contributed to the " spiraling descent "? @!Mr-CARROLL : And that could have contributed for him going with -- off with a gun. I mean... @!LAUER : So you think, basically, in the wake of these tragedies, we all look for answers... @!Mr-CARROLL : To put it on a movie... @!LAUER :... and we 're looking in the wrong place? @!Mr-CARROLL :... yes. I think it 's the fact that kids in this country today, I mean, I think the cliques have a lot to do with it, but they 're going to be there. But, I mean, it 's about kids have to learn -- I read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday, and the boys and girls were all fascinated, and it was so wonderful. But I read to a ninth grade class of New York City public school kids about six months ago, and all the boys just were saying, ' Oh, this is sissy stuff, I do n't want to hear it, ' you know, because it 's poetry and they have this connotation about it. @!LAUER : We have to reach kids at an earlier age. Jim Carroll, author of " The Basketball Diaries. " Again, thank you for doing the interview. I know you do n't like to do it. @!Mr-CARROLL : Thank you, Matt. @!LAUER : We 're back in a moment. This is TODAY on NBC.
