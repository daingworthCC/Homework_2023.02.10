EVELYN WILSON : sp? I knew that I was not the only one that was raped, but I had no idea there were thousands of us @!IPANNOUNCER Thousands of American women in the military, from every generation, in different wars reporting rape, assault, sexual abuse by their own comrades -- men in uniform. MALE SOLDIER : Thrashing a woman, you know, doing her till she 's hurting, till she 's sore, you know, that 's something that 's bragged about all the time @!IPANNOUNCER Our extensive investigation reveals widespread sexual misconduct in every branch of the military. NELCINA DAY : sp? They took my dignity. They took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and who I wanted to give to @!IPANNOUNCER Chilling stories from women frightened into silence. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : sp? And they told me if you say anything to anybody we 're going to kill you @!IPANNOUNCER Time and again, their claims were dismissed, protecting the men, preventing justice. BRIGITTE WILSON : sp? It 's hard to get good old boys to go after good old boys. I mean that 's hard to do @!IPANNOUNCER And, for the first time, the soldier who broke the silence and made sexual abuse in the military this week 's headline story. JESSICA BLAKELY : sp? I would n't go anywhere, you know? I would constantly be looking over my shoulder because I was terrified @!IPANNOUNCER Tom Jarriel with an American crisis making headlines today -- women under attack at home -- Rape In the Military. @PGPH Plus, the best of what science has discovered to rejuvenate aging skin. We looked at all the claims, at the products that promise to smooth out wrinkles. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : They actually can fill in fine wrinkles. They can fill in fine scars and make a significant improvement in appearance @!IPANNOUNCER We 'll tell you what your money will buy and what it wo n't. ARNOLD DIAZ, ABC News : What have you noticed? 1st CONSUMER : Not a thing @!IPANNOUNCER The ingredients to look for when you read the label. Arnold Diaz is going to make your day with good news about Getting Rid of Wrinkles. @PGPH Those stories tonight, November 15th, 1996, after this brief message. Commercial break BARBARA WALTERS : The story has been front page headlines for the past week. Officers at several army facilities now stand accused of raping or sexually harassing young women in their charge and a hot line set up by the army to hear similar allegations has been flooded with thousands of calls. Even so, Pentagon officials say they have no evidence that sexual abuse is widespread in the military. Well we hope they 're watching tonight. @PGPH For the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's women in uniform and what we have uncovered can only be described as a national scandal. HUGH DOWNS : At military bases across the country, in every branch of the armed services, women are being preyed upon in staggering numbers by those who serve with them. It 's a crisis the military has known about and virtually ignored for years. Tonight, Tom Jarriel breaks this story wide open with the help of some courageous women. They wanted to protect this country. Why did n't anyone protect them? 1st WOMAN SOLDIER : We 're the women in the military who were raped, beaten, assaulted. We 're the victims of an undeclared war. We have an incredible story. It is n't incredible because of the details. It 's incredible because the details are shared by so many. ARMY SQUAD : One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. We like it here. We love it here. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories, women 's war stories. They begin at the time of enlistment. 2nd WOMAN SOLDIER : When I was in the military, I loved the feeling of putting on my uniform every day. I was something. I was part of my country. I was doing something special. 3rd WOMAN SOLDIER : I felt like I was out there helping to protect the United States, helping to serve my country. 4th WOMAN SOLDIER : I was willing to risk my life, yes, absolutely. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over They joined the military for the same reasons men do -- to fight the enemy, to defend their country, to protect democracy. 5th WOMAN SOLDIER : I 'm the kind of person that when you go to a parade and you see the flag, you stand up and salute the flag. I get goose bumps. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over But they would fall victim, not to enemy fire, not to a foreign foe, to a more insidious enemy, the enemy within. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, gang raped, raped at knife point, raped at gun point by friends, colleagues, superiors. Lynn Dale, sp? raped on ship by an officer during the Gulf War. LYNN DALE : It was later that night when he burst into the bathroom, took me by my shoulders, threw me around, started kissing me, somehow got my pants off and penetrated me. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Joyce Massenburg, sp? raped while sleeping in her barracks. JOYCE MASSENBURG : The person came in buck naked with military black eyeglass on, put a knife at my throat, he pulled my panties down and he had sex with me. And I thought my god, please do n't let him kill me. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Barbara Alt, sp? raped by a marksmanship instructor. BARBARA ALT : Before I knew anything I was face down and he had raped me and he punched me in the face, held a gun to my head. He had a Colt.45, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Nelcina Day, raped by her supervisor on a base in Germany. NELCINA DAY : I saw someone come out of the window of the men 's barracks and the next thing I knew, he was upon me and that 's where he raped me. I saw his face. I still see his face and he knew it and he knew that there was nothing I could do about it. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Judy Brown, sp? raped during basic training on the way to the bathroom. JUDY BROWN : A man came up behind me with a knife and dragged me into an office and told me that he would kill me if I told anybody. I remember thinking there 's armed guards marching around this building, how did this happen, where were they? TOM JARRIEL : voice-over During the course of our six month investigation, 20/20 reviewed thousands of pages of military records and talked to over 300 people about rape in the military, including women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pain, proud military women now lost and homeless, women haunted by frightening memories. And they are not alone. @PGPH on camera 20/20 's investigation found that thousands and thousands of military women are raped and they 're raped by American servicemen. The total number of rape victims serving in uniform seems to be one of our deepest military secrets. According to the chairman of a Senate committee which issued this report in 1992, the committee estimated that 11,000 women in one year alone may have been raped or sexually assaulted and suggested a staggering 60,000 women veterans may have been sexually assaulted some time during their service. @PGPH More recently, in a 1995 Pentagon study, one in 10 army women said they were sexually assaulted and in one small study at a V.A. hospital, one in four women under age 50 said they were raped or sexually assaulted on active duty. In fact, so many women have reported sexual assault, the V.A. has opened 69 centers across the country to help them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5,000 in the last three years alone. @PGPH voice-over Former Senator Alan Cranston held Congressional hearings on sexual abuse in the military. @PGPH interviewing Senator, from your inquiries into this issue, why does it happen so often to women in the military? ALAN CRANSTON : I guess there are all sorts of reasons. One is the natural macho atmosphere in the armed forces among the men. They 're in there for a very tough mission defending the country, prepared to fight and die for the country, it 's sort of a boy 's club in the past and it 's really the culture of the life they lead. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Listen to this young man, a soldier who agreed to talk on the condition that he not be identified. MALE SOLDIER : Thrashing a woman, you know, doing her till she 's hurting, till she 's sore, you know, that 's something that 's bragged about all the time. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Experts say many military men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down barriers, competing for jobs. For many, it 's become a power struggle with sexual overtones and rape, say experts, is all about power. MALE SOLDIER : If you see a woman or you know a woman, a bunch of guys know a female who they perceive to be what they call a bitch, you know, they 'll say, you know, what she needs is a good word omitted to put her in line like word omitted straighten her out and be punishment for her or you know, or put her, or tame her, you know, like she 's some type of wild horse or something and a good word omitted will just, you know, tame her. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Colleen Mussilino sp? had been walking back to her barracks when she says she was gang raped by four soldiers at Fort McLellan, Alabama. COLLEEN MUSSILINO : I fought as hard as I could but they pinned down my legs and my arms and put their hands over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with their fists to keep me from fighting at which point I did fall unconscious. MALE SOLDIER : Also, it 's sort of an unspoken contest where you try and get all four services, you try and get the army, navy, air force, marine corps and once you 've got all, you know, that 's covered, that 's called, you know, covering the branches, getting all the branches of the service and once you cover that next step you brag about it, you know? It makes you more of a man in your peers ' eyes. ALAN CRANSTON : Another cause of the problem, another reason for it happening to the degree that it does is that weapons are so easily available and the men can threaten to kill if someone does n't submit or threaten to kill if the person reveals what happened and that leads to silence and fear. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over That 's what happened to Wretha Wilson, sp? who was raped by her drill instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun at me and it was still cocked and he told me if I moved or left the room before sunlight that he would kill me. EVELYN WILSON : This is an epidemic and they 're going to have to recognize it because they 've covered it up for years, for years. I hold them personally responsible for where I am today. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Evelyn Mitchell sp? was raped by a soldier. She now works with rape victims. EVELYN WILSON : I knew that I was not the only one that was raped, but I had no idea there were thousands of us. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : It was roughly in October of 1991 and I was at the naval amphibious base in Coronado, California. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Kimberly Youngerman 's tragic story began when she joined the navy. She had planned to further her education and travel. To her surprise, she fell in love with her work as a helicopter mechanic working on the flight line. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : There were days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blowing and the rotor would be going, I 'd go what am I doing out here? I 'm a girl. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over But Kimberly 's excitement soon turned to horror. A few months after enlisting, she met and married a navy SEAL. One night while her husband was at sea, she went to Gator Gardens, a club on the naval base at Coronado. When friends asked Kimberly to help a drunk sailor back to his barracks, she thought nothing of it. She knew the man, had worked with him and was happy to help. She put the sailor to bed and as she headed out of the barracks, she heard the men call out to her. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : They said something like, you know, hey or whatever and I turned and I go hi and then they grabbed me and pulled me into the room. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Three men, fellow sailors, the men who had lured her into the barracks, attacked Kimberly, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Two of them pinned me down at hands and feet and while a third raped me and they -- they did that repeatedly for -- for several hours. TOM JARRIEL : Were you able to scream out? KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Screaming and yelling. There were a couple different times where the door would open and a couple people would come in. TOM JARRIEL : Others came in the barracks, they heard you, they even looked in and did nothing? KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Others heard me, others came in, a couple of them watched for a minute or two and -- and left and -- TOM JARRIEL : That 's unbelievable. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : It is unbelievable. TOM JARRIEL : A young woman in a dark room with three men being gang raped -- KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Screaming for help. TOM JARRIEL : -- screaming and others looking in and this was in a military facility? KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Yes, barracks. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over The men left Kimberly that morning. She says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : I think at one point during the night I just thought that this was it, this was -- I might as well just forget it and my life was probably over because I did n't think there was any way that they were going to let me go and they told me if you say anything to anybody we 're going to kill you and they seemed very serious. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over The rape of America 's military women by America 's military men has been reported in every major conflict from W.W.II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. It 's happened on base, in barracks, in bars, overseas and on ships. In all these years, just how much did the military know and when did they know it? We filed a Freedom of Information Act request and obtained copies of court martial records from all services over the last five years. In them, we found thousands of reported cases of rape. Under military rule, this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army, navy and air force are briefed about these statistics at least once a year. And during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, women were assaulted and raped with frightening frequency. 20/20 obtained highly sensitive documents from the army 's criminal investigations division. It 's clear from these, too, that the army knew they had a problem. On March 17th, 1991 in southern Iraq, a U.S. army female reported she was raped by a male sergeant. On March 27th in Bahrain, an army female reported a male entered her ship 's cabin while she was sleeping and raped her. On May 19th in Saudi Arabia, a U.S. army female reported that an army male grabbed her from behind, placed a knife to her throat and forced her to perform oral sex. And the list goes on and on. NELCINA DAY : In any branch of the service, it 's a man 's world. It 's always been that way. Some of them, they have respect for women. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of raw meat. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Nelcina Day was raped by the supervisor she had come to respect and to trust. NELCINA DAY : It 's like your own government raping you. You 're serving with the enemy but the enemy are your peer and your supervisors. EVELYN WILSON : The betrayal is that they wear the same uniform you wear. That 's betrayal. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over That betrayal would turn to abuse and punishment. What happened to the women you 've heard and others you 'll meet after they were raped was almost as chilling and disturbing as rape itself. IPHUGH DOWNS : When we come back, the outrage continues. Military women claiming sexual assault by men they trusted are looking for justice. How will the military respond? As Tom Jarriel continues, you 'll see that in the armed forces, it is still a man 's world. Stay with us. Commercial break BARBARA WALTERS : Not a few, but thousands of women with the same traumatic experience, victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust violated. Why did n't they speak out more? Why do they still remain silent? Perhaps you 'll understand better when you hear what many military women go through after claiming sexual assault. As Tom Jarriel found out, it 's a battle few of them are prepared to fight. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Drawn in by patriotism and promises and kept in my courage and camaraderie, America 's military women were trained in the art of war. Together along with men, they hone their skills and bodies, preparing to battle side by side. What no one taught them and nothing prepared them for was that they could become the target, the friend could become the enemy, the system they had turned their lives over to might one day turn on them. Our investigation found case after case of women whose charges of rape were overlooked, ignored, dismissed, forgotten. Many experts we spoke to blame it on the way the system is set up. @PGPH on camera Unit commanders hold the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under laws defined by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the commanding officer of a unit makes key legal decisions. They 're not trained investigators nor are they lawyers, but they often wield enormous power. The commanding officer, for example, decides whether or not to charge an accused rapist, where and how the charges will be heard and approves the punishment before it 's handed out. @PGPH interviewing You joined the system, you lived by the system, you trusted the system. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Yeah. TOM JARRIEL : And the system? KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : The system did n't work for me. The system failed. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over When Kimberly Youngerman reported the rape to the naval investigative service, she signed a statement that said she had slept with one of the men a week earlier, something she now denies. She then went on to graphically describe the rape. When questioned by the naval investigative service, the three men admitted they had had sex with Kimberly but said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew at the time it was wrong and that he did not want to participate anymore. Dr. Margaret Howard sp? treats military women who 've been raped. MARGARET HOWARD : Well, a lot of rapists say it 's consensual. I mean rape is a totally irrational act and a man who is raping a woman has no empathy for that woman. He 's not thinking about her. So he can -- he can make up whatever he needs to make up in his mind to justify the rape, but it 's not consensual. Rape is never consensual. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Without holding a hearing, the navy dropped the charges against two of the men, deciding to hear just one case. It took a day for them to make their decision -- insufficient evidence to proceed. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : Which would lead me to believe that they were believed, that their story was more believable than mine because why would three respectable navy enlisted men do something like this. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims. BRIGITTE WILSON : It 's true of any of the issues of assault and harassment with women in the armed forces is that you are literally going up, butting heads with the very people who are the buddies and colleagues and chums of the person who has assaulted you and I think one of the big problems we see is that there really is no independent oversight or investigation. It 's all somehow tied in. It 's hard to get good old boys to go after good old boys. I mean that 's hard to do. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Kimberly Youngerman was devastated that the men she believed had raped her were now free. The night after the decision at her father 's home, she slit her wrists. I was afraid that now that the trial was over and they let them go that they were going to come find me. DAN YOUNGERMAN : It was real bad and I mean she would have died if we had n't found her. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Kimberly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it and stuff is just another form of abuse, you know? It made her question what she was doing. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Kimberly was taken to a psychiatric ward for treatment. Shortly afterwards, she was dismissed from the navy for attempting suicide. Kimberly 's husband died this year in a navy accident. Now she 's alone with her baby. As for the navy, they say they did a thorough investigation. Sarah Baker sp? contends the military 's handling of sexual assault would change her life forever. Shortly after joining the navy, Sarah was sent to the U.S. naval air station at Millington, Tennessee. On her first night there, she was asked out on a date by an airman. Sarah, who was young and naive, had never been allowed to date before and she was still a virgin. SARAH BAKER : He raped me. He took me into Memphis and took me on a date and it just got bad. He took me on a horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman and then we got to his house and I used to think it was my fault but I do n't know. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over At first Sarah told a different story about that night. She was afraid she 'd be thrown out of the service. But six days later, she went to the navy and to the Millington police and told them about the airman she claimed had raped her. @PGPH on camera Police told 20/20 they knew right away who Sarah was talking about because that same airman had been charged with raping another woman just a month earlier. That victim, military wife Jeannette Graves, sp? had reported the assault to the Millington Police Department and to the naval investigative service. @PGPH voice-over Now they had two separate charges of rape. But when the case went to court martial, at the last minute, the navy said they could not find Jeannette Graves and dropped the case. 20/20 had no trouble finding Jeannette Graves, who would have been happy to testify. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy says it acted in good faith in all cases. SARAH BAKER : Just hearing the other day that he 's out of the military or supposedly out of the military was enough to frighten me, but I ca n't live with fear. If I live with fear I 'll just -- I wo n't be able to survive, you know? I 've got to live somehow. I 've got to forget it. I mean I 'll never forget it, but I 've got to forget it as much as I can. BRIGITTE WILSON : They can get rid of these guys. They can get rid of these guys if they want to. Even if they do n't succeed in a criminal prosecution, they have the option of sitting down and saying we do n't want this person in our command. They can separate them administratively. It 's been done and they can do it. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over But no one separated Sergeant Ted Sinclair from the system and that would prove to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court system took over, a verdict was finally rendered. In 1986, Sergeant Sinclair was charged with the rape and sodomy of a young female private. The matter went to a military court martial and Sinclair was acquitted. Less than one year later, Private Wretha Wilson would become his victim. One night while she was off base on a pass, a soldier came to Wretha 's motel room. What happened next has so traumatized her, she has been hospitalized and continues to need heavy tranquilizers. WRETHA WILSON : He started beating me up and he was holding a gun, too for leverage or whatever, attacking and he just ripped my clothes off and threw me no the bed and continued to rape me. He said that I was going to die. I thought he was going to kill me. TOM JARRIEL : After several hours, the man left. Wretha reported the incident to the army 's criminal investigation division. But since the attack had occurred in a motel off the military base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They arrested Sergeant Ted Sinclair and jailed him as a suspect. It came down to civilian versus military justice in handling a rapist. Had the offense occurred on a military base in the jurisdiction of the military courts, Sinclair by high odds from past cases would have likely gone free. However, a civilian court convicted him and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. WRETHA WILSON : And it kind of felt good because he knew that I was the one pressing charges against him, that he was n't getting away with what he was n't getting away with what he did to me. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Of the 50 alleged rape victims 20/20 interviewed in depth, Wretha Wilson is the only woman whose rapist was sent to jail. She was also the only woman whose case was tried in civilian court. EVELYN WILSON : By not doing anything, they 're saying that you are n't worth it. That 's pretty much what they 're saying, that you are n't worth it. Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over Of all the cases 20/20 found, the case of Colleen Mussilino, a proud veteran, perhaps best illustrates how far the military might go to avoid dealing with the problem of rape, to protect its honor. Colleen says that while serving in the army, she was gang raped by four men on her way back to her barracks, beaten and left in the woods unconscious. She still suffers from her injuries. @PGPH interviewing Did they claim that it was consensual or did they claim anything other than it had been a sexual assault? COLLEEN MUSSILINO : They had confessed that they had done it. That 's the irony. TOM JARRIEL : Do you remember what they said before the commanding officer? COLLEEN MUSSILINO : I have no idea. All I know is that the commanding officer had come in and said to me that they had confessed that they had done it. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over In spite of that confession, Colleen says she was taken to a bare room like this and interrogated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, denied food or water. COLLEEN MUSSILINO : It was from seven in the morning till four thirty in the afternoon and it was -- it was relentless, the questioning was relentless. That 's why I feel like I was a prisoner of war. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over It went on for six weeks. Colleen began to wear down. The pain of the rape was being replaced by the fear of her interrogators. @PGPH interviewing What was their goal? What seemed to be what they were driving at by the questions? COLLEEN MUSSILINO : The final goal was what they had -- they wanted was me to not press charges and me to sign a paper stating that I would not press charges and I did. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over In the end, after she signed the paper, Colleen was ostracized, promotions denied, and finally, she left the military she loved so much. COLLEEN MUSSILINO : It was just like your mother and father, basically, telling you that you 're not worth saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my country, but they 're not willing to do anything for me to help me, to protect me. KIMBERLY YOUNGERMAN : I think, as a military woman walking through a military barracks, that should be the safest place on the planet for me. To know that, you know, these are supposedly America 's finest young men, that should be the safest place in the world for me. NELCINA DAY : But these people took my career away from me. They took my dignity. They took my pride. And they took my body that only belonged to me and who I wanted to give to. IPHUGH DOWNS : The story that hinted at this national scandal first made headlines last week, accusations of rape and sexual abuse at a Maryland army optimist. Just yesterday, Tom Jarriel met with one of the women who brought those charges. We 'll have that exclusive interview after this. Commercial break ANNOUNCER : From ABC News, 20/20 continues. Once again, Hugh Downs. HUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military women like the ones you just met to continue was finally broken by a young army recruit. She is one of at least 12 women who say they were raped, assaulted or harassed by officers at the army 's Aberdeen Maryland post. Her accusations made national headlines last week and new cases surface every day. Tonight, she tells her story exclusively to Tom Jarriel. Army life was not what she dreamed of when her mother let her sign up. JESSICA BLAKELY : My mom signed for me to come in and my recruiter came and told my mom that everything would be fine, that the army would take care of me. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over It took the recruiter 's assurance that she would be safe before the mother of 17-year-old Jessica Blakely would sign her into the army. At basic training, Private Blakely learned the domineering role of the drill sergeant in army life. JESSICA BLAKELY : They 're like your god. Everything they say is what you do. They are your whole entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell you what to do. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over In basic training, she learned to respect and follow orders from the drill sergeants. But a few allegedly crossed the line between giving legitimate orders to demanding illegal sex from recruits when Blakely reached her assignment at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. @PGPH interviewing How many non-commissioned officers hit on you, made advances toward you? JESSICA BLAKELY : About 10. TOM JARRIEL : This was a regular way of life? JESSICA BLAKELY : Yes. TOM JARRIEL : And you were the target? JESSICA BLAKELY : Yes. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Most of the alleged offenders were married men. She told us about one, Sergeant Nathaniel Beech, sp? who, against regulations, she says, made endless and unwanted sexual advances. JESSICA BLAKELY : He would close the door and he would just grab me and kiss me. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Blakely said she finally gave in and had sex with Beech, but when she tried to stop him by threatening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. JESSICA BLAKELY : He started calling and saying that -- that he would kill me. He said if I told anybody that he would cut my throat, that he knew ways of killing people where no one would find out who did it. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over According to Private Blakely, the nightmare did n't stop there. Another attack happened while she was doing office work and was approached by a drill sergeant named Delmar Simpson. @PGPH interviewing How well did you know Simpson? JESSICA BLAKELY : I did n't know him at all. He came up to me and he told me to go to the bathroom, just like that. He was just like go to the bathroom. TOM JARRIEL : This is a drill sergeant? JESSICA BLAKELY : Um-hmm. A few minutes later he came in behind me and that 's when he started telling me to do certain things for him. TOM JARRIEL : To disrobe? JESSICA BLAKELY : Um-hmm. TOM JARRIEL : Is that correct? JESSICA BLAKELY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to investigators, Private Blakely describes having intercourse with Simpson on the bathroom floor. Blakely says she never screamed, never said no, only that she was traumatized. @PGPH interviewing When you had sex in the bathroom, was it something you wanted? JESSICA BLAKELY : No. TOM JARRIEL : And did you resist? JESSICA BLAKELY : Yes. TOM JARRIEL : voice-over Sergeant Simpson was not charged with raping her but he has been charged with raping three other recruits, sodomizing two women and sexually assaulting three others. JESSICA BLAKELY : One girl actually clawed him and he was bleeding. She left a scar and that 's how they used, knowing that she was telling the truth and all these girls, their lives have just been completely torn upside down by this. TOM JARRIEL : What 's it done to you? JESSICA BLAKELY : I do n't trust anybody in the military anymore. TOM JARRIEL : You still have several months to serve. JESSICA BLAKELY : Yes. TOM JARRIEL : You still are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARRIEL : Are you afraid? JESSICA BLAKELY : Yes. IPHUGH DOWNS : Tom, top military authorities have gotten all these reports so they 've known what 's been going on. What have they been doing about it? TOM JARRIEL : Hugh, first, at Aberdeen, some of the accused men have denied the charges. Overall, Defense Secretary Perry declined our request for an interview to address these issues. He did say in passing this week that they need to broaden the investigations beyond Aberdeen. BARBARA WALTERS : Well to follow that up, individual cases of course it 's difficult to assess. But this report shows that the extent is gigantic. What can make the difference, Congressional investigations, a public uproar, what? TOM JARRIEL : Barbara, this is such a huge problem and demand such total reform it must come from the very top. Obviously the military has not been able to make the reforms yet that have been effective. It 's got to come from on high. BARBARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JARRIEL : The Department of Veteran Affairs has set up a toll-free 800 hot line for any woman veteran who feels that they have been the victim of sexual assault. They have a special number, which is 1-800-827-1000. Operators are standing by. Again, any woman veteran who feels they need help with this issue, 1-800-827-1000 is open for them for assistance. BARBARA WALTERS : Thank you, Tom. It should be a glorious career for women and many women want it to be. We all want it to be. HUGH DOWNS : Indeed. TOM JARRIEL : It 's sad. HUGH DOWNS : It is a massive problem. Thanks, Tom. BARBARA WALTERS : We 'll be right back with more after this. Commercial break HUGH DOWNS : No one has yet discovered the fountain of youth but it 's not for lack of trying. Empires have been built on products that promise to help us defy gravity and look younger than our years. How many jars of wrinkle cream have you tried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is yes. Arnold Diaz checked out the most popular brands of anti-aging skin cream. For anyone with the determination to look younger, there may finally be a way. ARNOLD DIAZ, ABC News : voice-over Selling so-called wrinkle creams is now a billion dollar a year business. The promises of youth in a jar are irresistible, though they 're often less than they seem. For instance, L'Oreal claims its product is even more than a wrinkle cream. clip from L'Oreal commercial ARNOLD DIAZ : It says when you need more than a wrinkle cream. Is that more than a wrinkle cream? Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : No, in fact I think it 's probably less than a lot of wrinkle creams. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over Dr. Andrew Scheman is the author of Consumer Report 's Cosmetics Buying Guide. He says Revitalift and many other wrinkle creams are really just moisturizers. So how can they reduce wrinkles? They ca n't, he says. That 's why they claim to diminish the appearance of surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is appearance. @PGPH interviewing So when it says reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles, is that true? Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : That 's probably true. It 's a moisturizer and all moisturizers reduce the appearance of wrinkles, at least for a short time. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over Moisturizers temporarily plump up the outer layers of the skin. But when the moisture evaporates, you 're left looking at the same old wrinkles in the mirror. So, do you really need to spend $63 for a product like Lancome Primordiale? clip from Lancome Primordiale commercial ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over Is it possible? In an unscientific test, we gave each of 16 volunteers two unmarked jars. For one side of their face, a plain moisturizer, Vaseline Intensive Care, price $4.000. For the other side, either the $13 Revitalift, the $40 Capture Rides or the $63 Primordiale. clip from Lancome Primordiale commercial ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over The wrinkle creams all promise visible results in seven or eight days. So, after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you noticed? 1st CONSUMER : Not a thing. ARNOLD DIAZ : Not a thing? It says within a week you should notice a difference. 1st CONSUMER : Well, I did n't. ARNOLD DIAZ : You did n't. Instantly smoothes skin 's surface. 2nd CONSUMER : No. ARNOLD DIAZ : No? 2nd CONSUMER : Sorry. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over Bottom line, while they may have liked the feel of one product over another, between the pricey wrinkle creams and the cheap moisturizer, they saw no difference in the way their skin looked. PHYLLIS DILLER : from television show And you know as you get older, you get dry and brittle. When you put your moisturizer cream on, your skin should n't go disparaging sound ARNOLD DIAZ : Until now, it has been a joke, moisturizers masquerading as wrinkle creams. But now for the first time ever, there are wrinkle creams available that have been scientifically proven to work better than moisturizers. In fact, there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this corner, the alpha-hydroxy acids. Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : The alpha-hydroxy acids are really the miracle drug of the 90s. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over AHAs, as they 're known, are the hot new ingredient at the cosmetics counter. Virtually every major skin care company is now selling creams and lotions with AHAs added. @PGPH interviewing What is it doing to the skin, rejuvenating it? Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : Well, it has several effects. Alpha-hydroxy acids exfoliate very nicely so they do leave a really nice, smooth feel to the skin. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over In addition to speeding up the removal of dead cells on the skin 's surface, over time, AHAs also act below the surface to produce new collagen. Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : Eventually it does make the skin firmer. It actually can fill in fine wrinkles, it can fill in fine scars and make a significant improvement in appearance. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over In beauty salons and doctors ' offices, they use high concentrations of alpha-hydroxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quicker this way, peels are expensive and can cause burning and even blistering. But the big surprise came last June when a study showed even a lower strength AHA found in some over the counter creams made age spots fade and skin look smoother. Dr. Lynn Drake sp? led the study. Dr. LYNN DRAKE : The changes noted with these low concentrations of alpha-hydroxy acids are subtle but real. However, they 're not going to make you look 20 when you 're 40. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over The change after just 10 weeks was enough to please test subject Lorraine Harrington. sp? LORRAINE HARRINGTON : It has lightened the red blotches and the dark blotches seem to have disappeared. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over But here 's the problem. The tests were done with an eight percent concentration of alpha-hydroxy acids. However, we found most creams on the market do not contain that much AHA, though consumers do n't know that. @PGPH interviewing So you need eight percent? Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say. Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : Most of them do n't. Most of them do n't. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over So we had 26 different AHA products tested in a laboratory. The results? Twenty-two of the 26 did n't even come close to containing eight percent alpha-hydroxy acid. @PGPH on camera And more money does not buy more AHA. In fact, we found just the opposite. The $70 Estee Lauder Fruition and the $125 La Prairie cream each had less than three percent alpha-hydroxy acid. The products our lab found had the most AHA were Avon Anew Intensive Treatment, Suave 's Age Defense, Pond 's Age Defying Complex and Formula 405 and they each cost less than $15. But before you go running out to buy one of these AHAs, take a look at the other contender in the battle of the wrinkle creams, Renova. It costs about the same, but you 've got to go to the doctor to get it. clip from Renova commercial ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over Renova has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reformulated version of Retin A, the acne fighter, with more moisturizer added. Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman Bill Cortaveri sp? touts Renova as the only government approved wrinkle cream. BILL CORTAVERI : If you 're an individual trying to make a choice, you know with Renova it 's beauty by prescription, beauty by science, beauty by evidence. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over While it 's different from alpha-hydroxy acids, Renova, a Vitamin A acid, also smoothes the skin, fades brown spots and fills in fine lines with new collagen. @PGPH interviewing What are fine lines? Are those those lines that you and I have around our eyes here? Dr. ANDREW SCHEMAN : These are fine lines. These are deep wrinkles. Renova will work for fine lines. It will not work for deep wrinkles. Renova will not put plastic surgeons out of business. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over There are some impressive before and after pictures from the clinical trials, in which there was at least some improvement in more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids in fading brown spots. But none of these gains came without some troubling side effects, which the company downplays. BILL CORTAVERI : With Renova there is a minor redness, some people actually call it a rosy glow. ARNOLD DIAZ : Right. BILL CORTAVERI : But the -- again, it 's generally transient and mild and goes away after a couple of weeks. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over He may call it a rosy glow, but the package insert states peeling dries skin, burning and stinging were reported by almost all the test subjects. And as for the effects going away -- @PGPH interviewing Your own study shows that these side effects come back, the dryness, the peeling and the redness. BILL CORTAVERI : Yes, these minor side effects, they can come back, but I think the really important thing is people find it a fair trade off for the results that they 're getting. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over The package insert also cautions Renova has not been established as safe and effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were done on younger women. However, many dermatologists like Dr. Debra Jalamey sp? prescribe it for patients of all ages. Dr. DEBRA JALAMEY : The reality is that it will affect a change in any skin type. So, for example, I have patients in their 70s that use Retin A and see a difference in their skin. ARNOLD DIAZ : voice-over So, which is better, Renova or alpha-hydroxy acids? Dermatologists disagree. Some recommend using both. But all agree the world of wrinkle creams, still full of misleading claims, remains a minefield for women and a gold mine for cosmetics companies who 've convinced them they have to do something about that face @!ACTRESS From " The Truth About Cats and Dogs " Do you see how dry and discolored you are? Do you see the irreversible sun damage? You have n't been taking care of your skin and it 's only going to get worse. IPBARBARA WALTERS : Obviously I do n't need any of this. All I need is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I do n't mean you, but what should one use, the Renova or the alpha-hydroxy? ARNOLD DIAZ : Well, the dermatologists say start out with the most mild, which would be the over the counter AHAs of eight percent or more. If they do n't do what you 're looking for, then move up to either the fruit acid peels or the Renova, which are harsher and may do more but also may end up with side effects. BARBARA WALTERS : I have tried some of these creams. A little advice, put some on the back of your hand or inside your arm and wait a couple of days to see if you do have any reaction, allergic or otherwise. Then if not, then I guess you can try them. And you have to keep using them, right? ARNOLD DIAZ : You have to keep using them, otherwise the effects go away and be very careful about the sun because your skin is more sensitive when you 're using these. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and do a little unintelligible. You 'll never know me, Hugh. HUGH DOWNS : I will. BARBARA WALTERS : We 'll be right back. Commercial break HUGH DOWNS : Well now it 's time to check in with Nightline. Ted Koppel previews tonight 's program. TED KOPPEL, ABC News : Tonight on Nightline, charges the CIA injected crack cocaine into the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The community confronts the director of the Central Intelligence Agency at an unprecedented town meeting. Crack and the CIA, tonight. HUGH DOWNS : That 's Nightline, after your local news. And that is 20/20 for tonight. We thank you for joining us. BARBARA WALTERS : And remember, we 're in touch so you be in touch. By the way, next Friday we 'll have the first interview with legendary actor Kirk Douglas since we spoke eight months ago. He is inspiring, believe it or not, a wonderfully funny, Hugh. I 'm Barbara Walters. HUGH DOWNS : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us here at 20/20, have a good weekend. Good night. may not have been proofread against tape.
