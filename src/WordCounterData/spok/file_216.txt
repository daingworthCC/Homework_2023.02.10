4124541 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Let 's talk about this now in The Roundtable. We 're joined by Peggy Noonan from " The Wall Street Journal, " CNN 's Van Jones and one of the top teams in political journalism, authors of " Game Change " and " Double Down, " now the managing editors of Bloomberg Politics, Mark Halperin and John Heinemann. Your new program " All Due Respect " premieres tomorrow. And, Mark, let me begin with you. The White House had no choice on Pierson by the end of the day on Tuesday, but they did not want to push her out. @!MARK-HALPERIN# They do n't want, no president wants to fight with the Secret Service, the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies. Those are tough bureaucracies to take on. I would 've preferred the President fired her rather than letting her quit. It was his selection. When people say this is not really his problem, he picked her to run the Secret Service. It is unacceptable to the country. We all respect the individual agents and the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so weak. I would 've preferred he fire her and announced big changes right away. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Especially, Peggy Noonan, after Director Pierson did not reveal that elevator incident when she spent a whole day testifying on Capitol Hill. It was so amazing. She talked and talked and talked in her testimony, then it ends. Then, the " Washington Examiner " and " The Washington Post " come out with this information that she somehow forgot to include about the scariest incident, the President in the elevator, the guy jumping around and he 's got a gun and, apparently, an unfortunate past. One of the things, it seems to me, about the Secret Service story is that it 's not only incredibly dangerous that the service unit is n't working, it 's also got to be turned around quickly. This is not the kind of thing where you can say, you know, eight months from now, we got to have it working. It 's got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and, John Heinemann, that is a good point. The White House now, this first review is only in the incidents that have been reported. It 's not about the bottom review. @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# Right. And then, you want to know, what other incidents there are? There was one much less serious that was reported at Bloomberg last week where, like, someone got backstage at a Congressional black caucus. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) They thought he was a congressman. @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# They thought he was a congressman. There was confusion. They eventually found out and they got him out of there. But, again, how that guy got back there, there are a lot of questions about, that should be discussed in a top to bottom review that goes back historically and then, the question of how you get to the point where people have confidence in whatever the review finds, which is that we 'll never see the results, even if it 's successful, even if it changes are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, right, because the way the service operates. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And Van Jones, another concern, I was struck by this front page story in the " New York Times " this week, talks about blacks seeing flawed shield for President. They quote Congressman Emanuel Cleaver saying, " well, the Secret Service, they 're trying to expose the president. " You hear a lot of that from African-Americans, in particular, this concern that somehow the Secret Service is n't doing all they should be doing for their president. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") First of all, that is unfair. I did get a chance to work in the White House. I know how hard this job is. Let 's not forget, if you 're a Secret Service person, you are one second away from history being made in a negative direction your entire time you 're there. This is a very high stress job. People sign up for this job. We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of African-American leaders being killed in this country, whether you 're talking about Medgar Evers, whether you 're talking about Malcolm X, Martin Luther King. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") So there 's a big sensitivity in the black community to, the minute he first announced, every African-American that I knew above the age of 50 said he 's going to be killed. And so there 's a huge concern that this level of shenanigans is going on. The last thing I want to say is this president has been threatened more than any other president and he deserves a better job. I wish that the Secret Service had only the job protecting the president, not all these others. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And, Peggy, this ties into this broader concern you wrote about this week, the title of your column this week, " Bureaucratic Brazenness, " you know, this loss of confidence in every official who comes out there and tries to calm us down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is going on in the executive agencies. To my mind, as I look at this White House six years in, I see a great deal of articulate thought and a great deal of, you know, let 's do some rah-rah, some build the spirit, some this and that, but they do n't seem that good at running the government, at running their own agencies. There have been a series of scandals, as we know, from early days of GSA through the Veterans Administration, which is a very tough mishandling by the government. This latest one is just the Secret Service. It feels like things are n't quite working anymore. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) How big an issue is competence in the midterms? @!MARK-HALPERIN# it 's a big issue if the Republicans are able to make it one. Because unhappiness with Washington goes to both parties, but the President does run the executive branch. Republicans, I do n't think, have found a way to talk about it and connect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it should be something discussed, but I have n't seen any Republican candidate actually draw the lines together in a way that 's that relevant to voters. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I want to talk more about the midterms when we come back. Got to take a quick break right now. We 'll be back to analyze all the midterms and the latest on 2016. Does George W. Bush really know what his brother Jeb wants. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) And that leads to us our Powerhouse Puzzler on Bush 's grandfather, Senator Prescott Bush. Okay, here 's the question, guys. Name the state he represented in the Senate. Bonus points if you know the year he was first elected. Answer in two minutes. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Okay, who knows their Bush history? Senator Prescott Bush, which state did he represent? Let 's see. When was he elected? @!MARK-HALPERIN# Nutmeg state. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Boy, everybody gets Connecticut and Peggy and Van get 1952. Excellent. Well done, guys. Excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No, that 's not what it said. That 's not what it said. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) We 'll be right back. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) Back now with our politics buzz board, topping it off just one month from Election Day, ISIS invading campaign airwaves. Tough GOP ads and tight Senate races from New Hampshire to Colorado, like this one in North Carolina from Thom Tillis. @!NARRATOR# While ISIS grew, Obama kept waiting and Kay Hagan kept quiet. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) Hagan fired back. North Carolinians need to know his position and he is spineless in this regard. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) President Obama talking up the economy and his agenda. @!PRESIDENT-BARACK-O# I 'm not on the ballot this fall, but make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot, every single one of them. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) But was it smart to make the midterms an Obama referendum? GOP candidates pounced and new grandmother Hillary Clinton is hitting the trail. Political reports that she 'll barnstorm key midterm states like Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver 's team at FiveThirtyEight gives the GOP a 59% chance of retaking the Senate, down one point from last week. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# Back now with The Roundtable. Mark Halperin of Bloomberg, is Nate Silver right to move just an inch away from the Republicans? @!MARK-HALPERIN# In the world of margins of error, I 'm not sure that 's much of a move. You know, right now, Democrats must change the electorate. the reason you see President Obama injecting his economic record in and you see him attacking Fox News in that same speech is because they need to change the electorate, they need to get the coalition of the ascended, the Obama voters, who do n't normally vote in the midterms, to vote in places like North Carolina and Iowa. Go race by race today, they 've got three of the six in the bag. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Republicans. @!MARK-HALPERIN# Republicans do. And right now they would get the final three. Kansas, though, is a huge problem for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they win six. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Pat Roberts not closing the gap there at all. Van Jones, I have to ask you this. I understand what Mark is saying about energizing the Obama electorate, but it did not seem like a wise move for the President to put his agenda front and center like that. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") Well, we 've got to get our base going. The other thing, too, is that we ca n't let the Republicans get away with some of the stuff they 're doing this week, just trying to bash Obama. Hey, you know, government is always your enemy until you need a friend. This Ebola thing is the best argument you can make for the kind of government that we believe in. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") A year ago, Ted Cruz shut down America 's government, shut down the CDC over shenanigans. What if that happened this year? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that they believe that you can take a wrecking ball to America 's government and never pay a price. Obamacare means that 8 million people who could n't have gone to the doctor last year, if they feel sick today, they want, if they 've got Obama, they can go see the doctor. The Democrats have to start talking like that. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But, Peggy, that does not seem to be top of mind of voters right now and certainly the campaigns, at least the Republican campaigns want to make this ISIS issue front and center. Yeah, there 's ISIS. There 's a bunch of stuff. Look, the Republicans, in some of the close cases, have been very interested in hanging the past six years on their Democratic opponents. that the President meant to help his Democrats out in the field when he said, in his speech the other night, I am not on the ballot but my agenda is. Well, how many Republican senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's his agenda that we 're voting on? I do n't think that did him or them a lot of good. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And we 'll see the president raising money, John Heilemann. We will not see him in the close states. But as you 're gon na write in Bloomberg tomorrow, we will be seeing a lot of both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# I mean, it 's really striking. If you think about the races that are in play, President Obama is welcome in virtually none of those states. He will not going to most of these close contested Senate races, some of the governors races, but he 's gon na basically be on the coast raising money. Hillary Clinton is welcome everywhere and will be almost everywhere, and then her husband also welcome everywhere and will be almost everywhere. They can do things. The candidates want them there as a matter of persuasion, as a matter of getting out the vote, and it signifies a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years, this has been Barack Obama 's Democratic party. It 's not been the Clintons ' party. They 've been in the wings. This is the moment where they come out and they, more or less, take control of the Democratic Party. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But they 're gon na have to show some, put some Ws on the board, right? @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# They are gon na have to do that. @!MARK-HALPERIN# You can even go back longer than six years. Remember, Barack Obama came to national prominence in 2004. Got elected. What did he do in 2006? He campaigned everywhere in the midterms. He went to Missouri. He went to northern Florida. He was welcomed everywhere. And as John 's piece makes clear, right now, there are very few places in this country where there are contested races. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You 've got more people going to the polls, Van Jones, saying they want to vote and send a message against President Obama, than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") Well, that 's true. This president is not as popular as he once was. But he is not wrong. His policies are incredibly popular. You have a Republican party that wo n't raise the minimum wage, that wo n't extend unemployment insurance to active job seekers who just need a little bit more runway. They wo n't be for fair pay for women. They wo n't help on student loans. So the Republican agenda is incredibly unpopular. Just because President Obama is not as popular, we 've got great people out there, like Elizabeth Warren, like Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, to build that case. that 's important. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# And these races are still close. We 're seeing Jeb Bush out on the trail as well and did hear from his brother, the former president, this week. @!PRESIDENT-GEORGE-W# Yeah, he wants to be president. he 'd be a great president. He understands what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or serving, plus family. He 's seen his dad. He 's seen his brother. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) So a little nudge right there. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") You 're talking about you ca n't be seen anywhere. That 's somebody who ca n't be seen anywhere. That 's the president. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He 's not gon na go out there. Oh, no. His numbers are going up. @!MARK-HALPERIN# Yeah, in the Dallas suburbs. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) A lot of mention of Jeb Bush, he seems to be holding back a little bit. This was the first time the interview with former President George W. Bush that I thought, geez, maybe Jeb is going to go forward. I had been feeling his ambivalence. May I say, Van, the story of next month 's election is on the Republican side, the past six years did n't work and on the Democratic side, huh, we 're not sure the past six years worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is the under meaning of all of it. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# You guys nodding your head when Peggy was talking about Jeb. Oh, they 're polite. @!MARK-HALPERIN# I 've got a piece. John 's writing about the Clintons. I 've got a piece about Jeb coming, about where he stands. And it 's funny, this week he was out impressing people on the campaign trail raising money. There are those who say he 's definitely in. I had three calls from people this week saying he 's in and there are people saying there 's no way he 's running because of three generations of Bush women. The reality is, it 's both more simple and more complicated. He has n't decided, but he is much closer to running than people realize. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) If you have n't decided at this point, are you running? @!MARK-HALPERIN# Well, he can decide in January. The thing about Jeb Bush is he can decide late. He is a monster fundraiser. He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got some work to do on Common Core and immigration, work to do at the grass roots, but in terms of what normally gets you the Republican nomination, elite support and fundraising, he is first among equals in this. VAN JONES( CO-HOST OF CNN 'S " CROSSFIRE ") But here 's what you got to say. If you want to put competence on the table, you got a Republican Party with Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and somebody named Bush. I 'll take that fight in 2016 any day. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Which is why some people, we only have a few seconds left, John Heilemann, which is why some people are talking about your first guest on your program tomorrow, Mitt Romney opening the door just a tiny, tiny bit. @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# Opening the door, but more than a tiny bit. You know, there is a story, Byron York wrote this story this week, had talked to a lot of Romney people and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cooperation on background from a lot of people in Romney 's world who were saying, yeah, he 's really looking at it. @!JOHN-HEILEMANN# he 's been looking over it more and more seriously over the course of the last few months and he 's more interested today, in some ways, for some of the same reasons that he actually got in the race in 2012, which was he looks at the field that Van just talked about and says, I do n't think there 's anybody else out there who might be able to win. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) That 's what always drives people. And we got... @!MARK-HALPERIN# If Jeb runs, he wo n't. But the elites and the money men also like Romney a lot, as much as they like Jeb, so that might be a little interesting to see. No? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Can not decide until after January. We got to take a break. Up next, we 're on the front lines of those massive protests in Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean for US ties to China? That and more, and our exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
