4025441 @!SENATOR-JOHN-MCCAI# At no time have I ever done anything that would betray the public trust. @!BILL-KELLER-@1 " NEW# According to some of the people who know him best, he can be surprisingly careless about his reputation. @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH-@1 " -# It 's " The New York Times " reporting about a Republican. You know damn well a story like this would n't run about Hillary or Obama. @!HOWARD-DEAN-@1DNC-# Now it looks like John McCain is part of the corruption problem in Washington. He does n't seem to really have an ethical compass. @!SENATOR-JOHN-MCCAI# I do n't have any more comment about this issue. I had a press conference yesterday morning. I answered every question. I 'm moving on. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) John McCain weathering the storm. We 'll talk about that. And all of the week 's politics on our roundtable. I am joined, as always, by George Will, EJ Dionne of " The Washington Post, " also the author of a new book, " Sold Out, Reclaiming Faith in Politics After the Religious Right, " Cokie Roberts, and Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all. And George, John McCain and their entire team are convinced that they got the better of the mini-scandal at the end of the week and that " The New York Times " was hurt more than John McCain. True? @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well there 's some truth in that. There 's a certain kind of conservative who hated Nixon until ' 73 because then " The Washington Post " and other liberals attacked him and they said, well, he 's our guy now. In McCain 's case, he was so lucky that this lobbyist in question was female. Because then the sexual innuendo took over a story that otherwise would have been about John McCain on the corporate jets provided by people with interests before the Commerce Committee, John McCain pressuring the FCC, and that does n't accord with the image of Saint John of Arizona. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) He would point out thought that was all eight years ago. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# Right, but, you know... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) So was the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen of spades is to a game of hearts. It overwhelms everything. And I think short term McCain had a good week because all of these conservatives rallied against " The New York Times. " I think long term this story hangs around because the core question - this is what the public editor of the internal critic at " The Times " said this morning. That the sex kind of drove out the legitimate part of the story in the public 's mind, which is, is this Saint John McCain? Is his campaign a band of brothers or lobbyists? And the new " Newsweek " has more detail on this, where John McCain seems to have contradicted himself in the course of defending himself. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But more than... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# So I think this lives for a while, longer term. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) More than seems to, Cokie, and I want to bring you in on this. Because Senator McCain 's denials were unequivocal on Thursday, about the relationship, about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company involved and " Newsweek "... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) That 's always a mistake. You know, because first of all it 's entirely possible that legitimately he does n't remember. And - I mean, it was a while ago. And just to, you know, leave yourself a little bit of hedge room makes a certain amount of sense. Because we 've seen it how many times that people get in more trouble for what they say after the fact than the fact itself. And that could happen to him. But I think right now we are certainly dealing with " The New York Times " being in much bigger trouble than John McCain. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # Well, but I think it 's really early to make any verdict, as EJ was suggesting on how this is going to play out. Because it 's not just " The New York Times " that is involved. I think most people agree " The New York Times " did not prove that there was a sexual relationship involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care very much if there is. But as you suggest, George, the Senator made some very unequivocal statements that are already starting to erode. He said his staff put out papers saying that he had not met with the broadcaster in question, Mr Paxson, who then said to " The Washington Post " that he did, in fact, meet with Senator McCain. Senator McCain testified, as it turned out, that he met and spoke... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# Under oath. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " #... under oath, that he spoke with him. We now have three different news organization, not only " The New York Times " but " The Washington Post " and " Newsweek " saying they independently talked to former McCain aides who spoke with him about this relationship and about - and at least the appearance of impropriety. And he unequivocally says it did n't happen. You now have a out there in the air that people are going to continue, I think, to explore. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be what Senators are supposed to do and all that. And it may not be corrupt. But it is the appearance of corruption. And the appearance of corruption is the rational Mr McCain has used promiscuously in his towering moral vanity to say that everyone else is guilty of this and therefore we must... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well it 's interesting though. I remember... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) His context. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A#... interviewing him about being on corporate jets in 2000. And his answer then was, look, I think it stinks, but that 's the only way I can get from here to there and that 's the system that we have to live by until we can do something else. And that 's what he always does. I mean, he does a good job of saying this is n't the way it should be, and I 'm working really hard to change how it is. But this is the way it is. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Except now he 's getting caught up in precisely that. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EJ on a separate but related issue of the public financing of this campaign. He had earlier said he was going to consider taking the public money. He got a loan based on the - not the promise but the expectation that he would have to apply for the public money, EJ, yet he got a letter this week from the head of the Federal Election Commission saying, wait a second. You 've obligated yourself, you ca n't get out of the system. Which would mean he only had about $5 million to spend, if it holds, between now and August. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# He 's going to have to consult that former corporate - that former constitutional law professor Barack Obama to sort this one out. I mean it 's a mess because well you do n't even have... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) First of all, there 's no FEC... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# Exactly. That 's what I was going to say. You do n't have enough members because of a fight between Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough members of the FEC to enforce this. So does McCain, the leading supporter of campaign finance reform, say, well, they ca n't enforce this, and besides this is n't what the law really meant. You 're at an intricate level of detail in campaign law. I think he 's gon na override the law because he ca n't afford not to. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think on this one, Barack Obama is in much worse shape on this one. And I think that he - that when we start... @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # You 're talking about the general. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Yes, because of the pledge he 's made to take public financing in the general if the Republican did it as well. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # Right. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) But Barack Obama is going to get out of that because he 's going to say what we need is a comprehensive solution which means not just money to get us to the presidential campaigns but the 527s as well and they 'll negotiate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more interesting than this. John McCain had two choices in Ohio. He could do what all of his Republican rivals did, which is go in and comply with the law which says you can come in and you can get all these signatures from all these counties. It 's a high hurdle. They did it. Or you can come in and wave your certification that you 're going to take public financing and skip all that, which he did. He has gamed the system brilliantly. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Ron, let me bring you in on the Obama question that Cokie raised as well, saying it 's more trouble for Obama. I say potentially you 're right, which is why - I actually believe he should keep the pledge. Public financing gives you $85 million from a very late convention, September, October. It 's basically two months, $85 million for two months. And he can raise and spend $10 million a month until then and then send his supporters to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # It may be $10 million a week in fact. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Right. Exactly. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # Look, I mean, we are living through a transformation of the way presidential campaigns are financed. I mean and what Obama is doing this year is taking trends we 've seen over the last few years and accelerating them to a remarkable degree. 650,000 donors by the end of January. If he 's the nominee, it 's entirely conceivable that he will have 2, 2 1/2 million active donors. I met a woman in California on the Sunday before the primary who said to me that every time my husband and I think about going out to dinner, we send $80 to Barack instead. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Oh my goodness. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # And she said it - and she said " Barack " with a sense of personal ownership. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Had she lost weight? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # And the reality is that this - you know, in the ' 70s and ' 80s Republicans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial advantage. It lasted a long time - bequeath to the party. Now Democrats have been more aggressive and effective at going on the internet. And Obama - no matter how McCain deals with is, the situation about from now until September, Obama,, if he is the nominee, is going to raise astounding amounts of money. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # And you know, but the only thing to keep in mind is in those last two months, even though it 's 85 - free - million dollars, that 's a lot of money to leave on the table, he probably could raise considerably more than that and so, as George has suggested, he finds a way around it. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But you reach a point of no... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# He does n't have the problem John Kerry had in 2004. In 2004, there was an enormous gap between the two party conventions. And so John Kerry had to stretch the public money over a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions is very small. So he 's not giving up what John Kerry gave up when he accepted public money. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) I think that 's exactly right. But we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. Although, you know, the wave seemed to hit Senator Clinton Thursday night at the debate. Let me show you this moment, final moment. @!SENATOR-HILLARY-CL# I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored. And whatever happens, we 're going to be fine. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And perhaps concerned that her supporters might think she was giving up, she came out with a very different tone yesterday in Ohio. @!SENATOR-HILLARY-CL# So shame on you, Barack Obama, it is time you ran a campaign consistent with your messages in public. That 's what I expect from you. Meet me in Ohio. Let 's have a debate about your tactics and your behavior in this campaign. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) She is going to fight, George Will, she is not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math is perilous for her, the delegate math. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Yes she has to win the last three big states, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, by at least 20%. She shows no sign being able to do that in any of them. The arithmetic, it 's almost Huckabee-ian at this point. She has to say I 'm for miracles. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I mean what happened - Wisconsin happened. And she lost by too much in Wisconsin. She lost too many groups that had been with her. The only group she still really has is white women. And I do think that there 's some possibility that you will see a sort of reaction among white women. I had the opportunity... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Like New Hampshire. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera)... to interview Billie Jean King this week. And she said, you know, I feel like everything I worked for all my life is going out the window. And there is that sense. I mean, here is this woman who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're supposed to do it, and then this cute young man comes in and says a bunch of sweet, you know, nothings, and pushes you out of the way. And a lot of women are looking at that and saying, there goes my life. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But play that out. Let me bring in both Ron and EJ on this. Let 's say you 're right. Let 's say she pulls out a five-point win in Ohio, a five-point win in Texas. Very possible with those kinds of wins, EJ, that she actually does n't pick up any delegates that day because she loses Vermont. And that 's the nightmare scenario for a lot of Democrats. She wins, she keeps going, but no possibility of getting the nomination. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# Well the Texas process was organized by the Rube Goldberg... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Exactly. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# There 's such a - you know, caucuses and primaries. All of which benefits him. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# So all that works in Obama 's favor. Her biggest problem is that he can play to win. If he knocks her off in one of these states, he could actually assemble a majority. She 's playing to tie. And then to pray that all kinds of other factors come in to play later, the Super Delegates, Michigan and Florida, which as Senator Biden said, she ca n't win just by taking those delegates. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And look at those Super Delegates... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# So it 's a disadvantage... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But look at what 's been happening with the Super Delegates, Ron. The last two weeks, he 's picked up 25 Super Delegates. She 's lost two. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # And not only the last two weeks, really since the voting began in Iowa. In 2007, most of the major endorsements went to Hillary Clinton. Since the voting began in Iowa - in January, what did we see? We saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napolitano, Kathleen Sebelius, Ben Nelson, move towards Obama. In February, we have seen liberal leaders of the party, starting with Ted Kennedy, moveon.org, the SCIU, last week, " Chang to Win ", the alternative to the AFL union coalition endorsed Obama and out - on the phone call announcing the endorsement, Anna Berger, the chairperson of it said we are endorsing because we think it is - we are reaching the point where it is the time to begin wrapping up this nomination. And I think that unless Hillary Clinton wins decisively in Ohio and Texas, the movement of the elite level is already toward Obama. You would see that accelerate. And I do think you would see more across, especially after - Cokie 's point is really important. In February, when Obama was winning, he was mostly winning states where his voters outnumbered her voters. Wisconsin, the results in Wisconsin came accompanied by the sound of something cracking. It was the first time that non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress in Virginia, but he carried a majority of them in Wisconsin. It suggested - it had the feel of the party saying, look, this has been a great race but we have made our decision. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It did have that feel. There 's still - I mean you look at these numbers and you still see lots of land mines, not necessarily in the nomination but in the general election. I mean, you start looking at young voters. Are they going to show up? Probably not. They never have before. By the time November comes, they 'll be tired. You know, they 'll have heard it all. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # I do n't know. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You look at independents. They 're the least likely people to vote. I mean, you have all these groups that are not necessarily going to show up. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) They 've shown a lot of enthusiasm all year long for the Democrats. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I know. But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And how do you hold it? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Right. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And this is what the Obama campaign is dealing with right now. And let 's look a little bit at that. They got a little bit of a scare this week when Michelle Obama came out with some - what turned out to be controversial comments. @!MICHELLE-OBAMA-@1W# For the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) George, she started back-pedaling the next day. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Well, she should. Because what that does to - a lot of people say, uh-oh. There is this latent thing in the Democratic Party that it has a kind of adversarial stance to mainstream American patriotism. It 's just there. And it seemed to leak out there and they have to stop that awfully fast. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# There was a cartoon of Mrs Clinton lecturing Barack Obama saying, get control over your spouse. So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic primary very much. But I think it is a problem. I think that there is - you know, Obama speaks like an instinctive patriot. And I think people hear that in his message. And I think anything that goes crosswise to that ends up hurting him in the election. And I do n't think you 're ever going to hear something like that again. Because if there 's one thing both Obama 's have shown is they learn a lot on the run and you look at... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Absolutely, every single month. @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W#... Obama 's - yes, when you look at Obama in the debate, for example, he is so much better now than he was six months ago. And I think they 're not gon na make any mistake like this one again. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And also, look, you 're on the road, you 're saying a lot of things. Things come out of your mouth that you just feel like, oh my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Off-camera) We 've all been there. Let me bring Ron in but on a specific question, building on this. I do n't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But if he is the nominee - and I think the Obama campaign already realizes they have a couple of vulnerabilities they have to deal with that they saw during the primaries. Number one, that he comes off as a little aloof, not as someone who really cares about people in his bones. And, secondly, that he will be accused of being a reflexive liberal, despite all this talk about being a bipartisan healer. How do they address that? @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # They 're both challenges. First of all, an Obama/McCain race, if it comes to that, I think would further scramble the traditional class alignment of American politics. I mean Barack Obama has shown in this primary an enormous appeal for upscale, well-educated white voters, many of whom have been - are disillusioned with Bush. Look at Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as well. He has an opportunity to cut into a lot of that vote. But among kind of a blue collar America, where experience counts more, where national security may count somewhat more in a kind of traditional way that Republicans play it, you can imagine an opportunity for John McCain to win, in particular, a lot of those white waitress moms that Bush won in 2004 around security issues who have not voted for Obama in this campaign. And that is - you know, you can see, for example, an Obama who could be a very strong candidate in Virginia, in Colorado, in affluent states, but have a lot of trouble in some of those interior states that are economically troubled. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) And the Reagan Democrats who had gone to Clinton go back to McCain. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think that 's right. @!GEORGE-WILL-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Probably. I mean it seems to me Obama 's problem is that you can only be a novelty once and for a while. And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ quite enough now. This stuff about - I 'd call it banal eloquence. Where he says, in the face of despair, we can still hope. I have news for him - Americans are n't in despair. Look around you. Who 's despairing? @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well the other thing is... @!EJ-DIONNE-@1 " THE-W# They 're unhappy in a public sense. They may be happy in their private lives, but they 're unhappy about public things. @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) What has not been useful for Hillary Clinton because of running among liberal Democrats is his voting record. And, you know, the truth is, is that if it were a Republican running against him, he can put him, you know, just squarely on the left of the Democratic Party. You know, he 's got a very - very much, you know, ADA approved - Americans for Democratic Action approved voting record. He, unlike Hillary Clinton, oddly enough, given the rhetoric, has not reached across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get things done, which she has done. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " # And also in the course of the election, I mean he 's had a number of areas where he 's suggested kind of challenging the base on social security, for example, considering benefit reductions... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Affirmative action. @!RON-BROWNSTEIN-@1 " #... on merit pay for teachers. And he has significantly backed off - and in fact, now, there 's kind of a cognitive dissidence between the way he is concluding this campaign in Ohio, with a very strong populous anti-business kind of message and this broader argument about bringing people together around the table. He says he wo n't talk to any lobbyists. Who 's going to be at the table? He sees the opportunity to go after the blue collar vote in Ohio. And put the death brawl, end this campaign, but in the process, I think he is clouding the larger message that... @!COKIE-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Well, not to mention what happens in the general election. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.
