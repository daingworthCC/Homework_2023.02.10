231041 JIM MORET, Anchor : I 'm Jim Moret in Los Angeles. Welcome to our coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial. We 're still waiting for defense witness Rosa Lopez to take the stand. She 's the housekeeper who worked next door to O.J. Simpson. She says she saw his Bronco parked at his home at the time of the murders. Her testimony is being handled out of turn because of her threat to leave the country. Lawyers on both sides spent most of this morning in chambers or in side-bar. Prosecutors are fighting for access to a statement they claim Lopez gave to the defense over the weekend. Defense attorneys said in court they have no notes or recordings. Later this morning, Lopez herself headed into Judge Lance Ito 's chambers. There was a request to get her a new translator, one more familiar with her El Salvadoran dialect. No word on who made that request, but a new translator has been found. When Lopez does take the stand, it will be in front of a video camera, not the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor Marcia Clark. She says she was not given a chance Friday to argue against the live testimony, and that her side has not had enough time to prepare rebuttal witnesses. Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran called that disingenuous, and suggested Clark invented a child care problem Friday in order to buy time. JOHNNIE COCHRAN, Simpson Attorney : It 's the usual thing, Your Honor. And for her to say that our whole case hinges upon this witness is preposterous. We have a number of other witnesses, and they are very much aware of it. And specifically, the Court has ruled on this. They agreed to it. We talked about it, as you said, a half dozen times. And when they asked for the delay on Friday night to look at the transcript, they did n't say, ' We do n't want to have her testify before the jury. ' They said, ' We just ca n't do it tonight because, even though Mr. Darden is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and advise him and tell him what questions to ask. ' And that was why we put it over. We went through this in detail. And so clearly, Your Honor, this is another attempt by them to avoid facing up to what they have to face up to in this case. And we 're ready to proceed. And we should proceed. The Court 's ruled on this. It 's the honorable and fair thing to do. And all the rest of it is wild speculation on their part, and totally disingenuous. I 'd ask the Court to allow us to proceed at this point. MARCIA CLARK, Prosecutor : I 'm offended as a woman, as a single parent, and as a prosecutor and an officer of the court to hear an argument posed by Counsel like that of Mr. Cochran today. Some of us have child care issues, and they are serious and they are paramount. Obviously Mr. Cochran can not understand that, but he should not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have those considerations. And I 'm deeply offended. The People, I would like to indicate the People are strenuous and vigorous in their desire to have this witness testify. We want the ability to fully and effectively cross-examine her. We feel that it would be the fairest thing for both sides to do that in a conditional examination. What the Court nor the People could not know on Friday is that new information was obtained- would be obtained over the weekend, which it has been, that will provide fertile ground for more effective cross-examination. This information needs to be followed up. It will also afford us the opportunity to present our rebuttal effectively, having gathered all of that information at one time. JIM MORET : Over repeated objections from the defense, Judge Lance Ito sided with the prosecutors and ordered the proceedings videotaped. Judge LANCE ITO, Los Angeles Superior Court : The original defense request was for a 1335 conditional examination, which I granted. And after our discussions, I was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better under all circumstances then to have Miss Lopez testify before the jury, since that is the ideal situation. However, the rights of both sides will be protected under the 1335 procedure, so I will modify my order and we will proceed. JIM MORET : O.J. Simpson 's defense team has asked for documents relating to alleged police internal affairs investigations of LA Detective Mark Fuhrman. In a motion filed today, the defense says it was informed last week that the department is investigating whether Fuhrman planted the bloody glove at Simpson 's home, or otherwise tampered with evidence. The defense says it also wants information on two other investigations, one reportedly on allegations Fuhrman had a swastika or other Nazi symbol at the police station. The other concerns, comments he allegedly made about Nicole Simpson 's anatomy, indicating he knew her personally. Judge Ito has set a hearing on that motion for March 3rd. Let 's get some analysis now from our guests. Joining us from our Washington studios is Greta Van Susteren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Georgetown Law Center. And here in Los Angeles, Roger Cossack is a criminal defense attorney and former LA prosecutor. Greta, first to you. Are you surprised- and I 'm sure you are- that this is taking so long. You 've commented in the past how long these proceedings take in California. Any surprises here? GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, Trial Attorney : No, Jim. And this is not a sophisticated legal issue. This matter should have been taken care of in probably 30 minutes or less. But it seems to have gotten a life of its own on Friday. And the life seems to continue to grow. This is a very simple issue. And am I surprised? Not particularly. Should it have happened? No. JIM MORET : We are getting audio now from the courtroom. I see the camera has tilted down. Court is once again in session. Let 's listen in to the proceedings. We 're expecting Rosa Lopez to take the stand any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Counsel. Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Bailey. People represented by Miss Clark, Mr. Darden, and Miss Lewis. CARL DOUGLAS, Simpson Attorney : I have a matter, Your Honor, I 'd like to bring to the Court 's attention, and it was the subject of some discussions that we had in chambers. Your Honor, there, as the Court is aware, Your Honor, this afternoon- this morning, a document which is a two-page statement written by an investigator and addressed to Mr. Shapiro concerning Rosa Lopez was turned over to the prosecution after having an in camera review with the Court. That was a document that is dated July 29th, 1994. Now, Your Honor, I was under the impression that that document had been turned over to the prosecution consistent with other documents that we had turned over on September the 1st, 1994. Indeed, Your Honor, when we discussed with Miss Lopez last week the substance of her testimony, we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That document, Your Honor, included reference to an undocumented housekeeper who was named Sylvia, who is acquainted with Miss Lopez, and who was present on some times that are not critical nor germane to the substance of Miss Lopez ' testimony. Miss Lopez had expressed severe concern that this Sylvia, and she is not aware of Sylvia 's last name, but that Sylvia, since she was undocumented, did not want to have any involvement at all in this particular case, and did not want her name mentioned at all in any reports dealing with Miss Lopez ' statement. It was with that context that Mr. Pavlic sp generated a second document, which was an interview of Miss Lopez which occurred, and that document was dated August the 18th, 1994. It is the August the 18th, 1994 document that was turned over to the prosecution. I have, Your Honor, in the interim since this morning, checked with my office to see whether my office had any record or knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the documents that I used to help discuss Miss Lopez ' testimony with her this past week. And I was told that we did not have the August 18 document in our particular file. I learned about the possibility that such a document existed when I spoke to Mr. Pavlic on Sunday, complaining that Mr. Pavlic had included in his report to the prosecution a name that Miss Lopez had wanted to not be included. It was then that I learned, and I verified it when I checked my own documents here in court, that in fact there had been a second report, the August 18 report, that was in fact a two-page document of Miss Lopez, just as the July 29 statement was a two-page document of Miss Lopez. That is where my confusion was born, such that when I saw that there was a two-page statement of Miss Lopez, I thought we were talking about the earlier statement, and I was not aware of the existence of the August statement. I anticipate that Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some outrage, and some sense of prejudice. I would like to say these words in response, however. The August 18 statement that was turned over to the prosecution is more detailed in terms of the germane facts of Miss Lopez ' testimony. There is more inclusion, for example, in the August 18 statement about the circumstances of the June 13 interview between Mr. Fuhrman in the morning and Miss Lopez. More information was contained in the August 18 statement than was even in the July 29 statement. The August 18 statement was created simply to assuage Miss Lopez ' concerns that her undocumented friend, who did not want any involvement in this case, might come forward, her name might be released, and she might then be interviewed or some way involved in this case. However, Miss Lopez told me, and told Mr. Cochran when we were discussing that statement, that she had had subsequent conversations with this Sylvia, and that Sylvia had in fact been interviewed by Los Angeles Police Department officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any acquaintanceship with Miss Lopez, knew her only briefly, and did not have any information to lend to anything concerning this case, which was consistent with the statement that Sylvia told Miss Lopez that Sylvia did not want to have any involvement in this case, and would deny any subsequent involvement of the case, were she to be asked about it. Therefore, Your Honor, if there is some claim that there is some surprise that there is some prejudice, I think that you should inquire whether or not this Sylvia person has ever been known to the prosecution, whether or not this Sylvia person had ever been interviewed by the prosecution, and she was in fact interviewed, as I said, months ago. Her relevant involvement in this particular case is not germane to the substance of Miss Lopez ' statement that some time after 10:00 o'clock, she went outside walking her dog, and saw Mr. Simpson 's Bronco in a location identical to where she had seen that Bronco earlier in the evening. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of relevance is to explain why at approximately 8:00 o'clock, Miss Lopez was outside, waiting for Sylvia to come over, and thereby saw Mr. Bronco's- Mr. Simpson 's Bronco parked in the same position as it was parked later after 10:00 o'clock, and why sometime after 9:00 or 9:15, Miss Lopez was outside to see Mr. Simpson leave and to notice that he had left in his Rolls Royce with another man, who we now know was Kato Kaelin, when they went to go get a hamburger. The statement in August includes mention of Miss Lopez being outside at 10:00 and seeing the Bronco, includes mention of Miss Lopez seeing Mr. Simpson leave in his Bentley after 9:00 o'clock with an unknown person, and then learning that there was some hard-soled shoes walking down Mr. Simpson 's property about 20 to 30 minutes after he had left to McDonald 's. CHRISTOPHER DARDEN, Deputy District Attorney : Excuse me, Your Honor. Excuse me. If Miss Lopez is here, can we have her step outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sp, why do n't you and your client step outside while we 're discussing your client 's potential testimony, please? Thank you. Please wait in the hallway. Thank you, Counsel. CARL DOUGLAS : But, Your Honor, any involvement or any mention of Sylvia or any relevance to anything that she may offer is really collateral and tangential to the substance of Miss Lopez ' testimony. The statement that we gave in August is more complete as to what Miss Lopez will testify to, than the statement that was in July. The prejudice, if any, is minimized because the People have already interviewed this Sylvia, the People have a statement, I would assume, although I have never seen any reports of the interview of Sylvia. But Sylvia told Miss Lopez that in fact she was interviewed by detectives or police officers shortly after the incident occurred, months ago. And therefore, Your Honor, I think that, yes, there was a problem because a two-page report that predates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. However, the report that was turned over is more complete in terms of the testimony that Miss Lopez will give in this trial. And the reason why the second report was given- was created was simply to protect the identity of an undocumented worker who did not want to have her name mentioned or to be involved in a case of this sort of profile. JIM MORET : We 're going to take a short break in the arguments of Carl Douglas, defense attorney, and be back with more, right after these words. Stay with CNN. commercial break the following transpired during CNN break CARL DOUGLAS : I 'm also reminded, Your Honor, that we, upon learning, and this morning when we were looking at the documents that we turned over to the prosecution, learned for the first time that, in fact, to our surprise, the July 29 statement was not the one that had been turned over, but it was this August 18 statement, and that was then the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Court and then voluntarily turned that document over to the prosecution. Judge LANCE ITO : Miss Clark? Certainly. MARCIA CLARK : I feel like I 'm experiencing deja vu. All over again, that 's right. Mr. Douglas stands before the Court once again to fall on his sword. I guess he 's elected to do that. That 's his job in this trial. I 'm not impressed. I think that these representations by Counsel are unavailing to alleviate the problem that they have created by willfully failing to disclose material statements. This July 29th statement is not only- Counsel wants to represent to us that the August 18th statement was more detailed and had more relevant information than the July 29th statement. When I went through and compared the two statements, what I found was that actually in most relevant respects the July 29th statement was far more detailed. And there was one obvious omission in that July 29th statement, and that is that at 10:15 to 10:20, on July 29th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and made no mention of seeing the Bronco at all. That statement is totally absent from the July 29th statement. Only on the August 18th statement does it state- end of commercial break JIM MORET : Marcia Clark is arguing the defense willfully failed to disclose a material statement of Rosa Lopez dated July 29th. MARCIA CLARK : - That she went out to walk the dog at 10:15 to 10:20 and saw the Bronco. Obviously, we have some material discrepancies of a very important nature, discrepancies that we should have been informed of quite a long time ago, discrepancies that would have allowed us to address Miss Lopez in a far different manner. With respect to the greater detail in the August 18 statement, let me point out that it was only the July 29th statement when she made mention of what kind of shoes she was adamant the prowler was wearing. August 18th says nothing about that. The information concerning Detective Mark Fuhrman in July 29th statement is no different. In fact it states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas in the August 18th statement it says that he was subsequently identified as Mark Fuhrman. And lest there be any mistake made here, Your Honor, the August 18th statement makes no mention of a July 29th interview. And the August 18th statement states specifically that it is not an edited version of a prior statement, that it was a statement generated by Rosa Lopez on August 18th. So we have not only willful failure to disclose the July 29th statement by their late presentation today, but we also have a deliberate material misrepresentation implicit in the August 18th statement, in which it purports to have interviewed her once and only once, and that was on August 18th, deliberately misrepresenting and misleading the People to believe that there was only one interview. Now, what makes that an even more gross lie is that both statements were taken by the same investigator, Bill Pavlic, given to the same attorney, Robert Shapiro. Obviously counsel knew. Obviously Pavlic knew that there was a prior statement. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a material misrepresentation in and of itself. And as officers of the court they should be ashamed. They should be embarrassed. In fact, their bar tickets should be hanging in jeopardy at this point for this kind of misconduct. And this is misconduct. There 's no question about it. The question is what the Court wants to do about it. That 's another issue. But I am appalled. I am appalled as an officer of this court that these kind of misrepresentations would be propounded in the manner that they are, with these sanctimonious denials and claims of being fair-minded and open-handed and forgetting. Forgetting? Forgetting that there was supposedly a witness who would corroborate at least some aspect of Rosa Lopez ' statement? Obviously Rosa Lopez put this person into her July 29th statement for the express purpose of showing how credible she was. And when the defense found out that Sylvia was not only not going to corroborate Miss Lopez, but was going to say, ' She 's a liar, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't at her house and I did not make an observation of the Bronco, ' she conveniently disappeared from the statement. That 's the truth. All we knew- and Counsel wants now to point the finger at us to try and put us on the defensive after their misconduct, which is reprehensible in itself. I would like for the Court to know what that situation was. What happened is that we received a clue to talk to a maid named Sylvia who said that Rosa sold her story for $5,000. And that 's what we did. We interviewed a maid named Sylvia who lived close to the Rockingham address of the defendant. And she denied having spoken to Rosa- she denied having any close relationship with Rosa Lopez. She denied having any knowledge of the case at all. She said she did know Rosa, but having ridden the bus with her a couple times, and that 's all she knew. And so there was nothing to generate, because all we did was follow up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information. ' We had no idea, because of the defense misconduct, that Sylvia was somebody who had some material information, Rosa Lopez claimed. And so all we were doing was following up a tip that did n't pan out. Had we known that Rosa Lopez made this statement on July 29th, claiming to have visited- and now the defense wants to downplay her importance, and they want to downplay her importance in order- this is gon na be how they cover up, how they explain away yet another way we 're going to expose Rosa Lopez as a liar. This is- now we 've got their cover story. The Court 's heard it. That this woman does n't want to get involved, and she 's an illegal alien. Illegal aliens tell the truth, too, Your Honor, and I 'm sure that Sylvia will tell the truth if asked, whether or not she was with Rosa Lopez that night. But obviously she becomes a source of impeachment material. Judge LANCE ITO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our determination that the Sylvia mentioned in the report from July is the same Sylvia that the tip was followed up with? MARCIA CLARK : We have no way of knowing that. Because the defense hid this report from us, we have no way of knowing at this time. We 're going to attempt to find out. Judge LANCE ITO : OK. Second question, although from Mr. Douglas ' comment I take that to mean that apparently it 's the same person. MARCIA CLARK : It would seem that they are saying so. Judge LANCE ITO : All right. Sure. MARCIA CLARK : We 'd like to point out to the Court that we have an inconsistency even among defense counsel. Judge LANCE ITO : Miss Clark, I just had two questions. MARCIA CLARK : I 'm sorry. Judge LANCE ITO : Let me pose-.
