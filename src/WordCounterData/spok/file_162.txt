4027141 BILL @!HEMMER, CO-HOST : Welcome to AMERICA 'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS. And good afternoon or good evening, depending on where you are. I 'm Bill Hemmer. @!MARTHA-MACCALLUM- : And I 'm Martha MacCallum. Good evening, everybody. This is the place for all things politics, your official news show of the 2008 election. @!HEMMER : Let 's begin now with Alert from New York City. Now developing tonight : Eliot Spitzer is stepping down. The Democratic governor is resigning with wife Silda by his side -- offering this apology for allegedly spending tens of thousands of dollars on high- priced hookers. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!ELIOT-SPITZER-@1D : From those who whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much -- the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York and the chance to lead this state. I 'm deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : Spitzer 's resignation goes in effect Monday. Lieutenant Governor David Paterson will take the rein then. Barack Obama is accusing Geraldine Ferraro of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics. Ferraro is not backing away from comments that Obama would not be doing so well if he were white. She also insists that her remarks would take another context and are not racist. We will analyze this political firestorm coming up again today in a few minutes. John McCain back in New Hampshire today, thanking voters there for taking part in the January primary that helped him win the Republican nomination ultimately. McCain is also fundraising today in Manchester in Boston, Massachusetts. Hillary Clinton is now falling further behind Barack Obama in a delegate count after the primary in Mississippi. And coming up in a moment here : The big vote in Pennsylvania, why both sides argue a win there is the ticket to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Brit Hume on that, minutes away here. Martha. @!MACCALLUM : All right, Bill. Well, breaking developments tonight in New York 's big sex scandal : Caving in to threats of impeachment and media pressure, Eliot Spitzer quit today over his alleged involvement with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRESPONDENT - NEW YORK CITY : Hello, Martha. We are now back at the home of Eliot and Silda Spitzer, it is a multimillion dollar apartment building on Fifth Avenue, built by his father. He comes from a family fortune worth $500 million. He will be out of a job on Monday, and could be facing legal trouble. Let 's take a look at this video after he announced his resignation on Monday. Look at his wife. She darted out of the SUV, not even waiting for her husband, quite a different picture of those two just a half hour earlier when he made his announcement. Silda Spitzer 's 21-year long marriage with his -- woman who he met during Harvard Law School was standing by his side when he announced that he was resigning effective Monday. He said that he 's grateful for her love and support and that of his family. He apologized and said he was proud of his accomplishments as governor and he paraphrased one of his predecessors, Teddy Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SPITZER : I go forward with the belief, as others have said, that as human beings, our greatest glory consists not in never falling, but in rising every time that we fall. As I leave public life, I will first do what I need to do to help and heal myself and my family. Then I will try once again outside of politics to serve the common good. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SHAWN : Well, he will be replaced on Monday by Lieutenant Governor David Paterson. He is a 52-year-old African-American state senator. The minority leader of the State Senate now comes from a very prominent Democratic family. His father is a big time lawyer, a former partner with Harold Ickes in a Long Island law firm. But tonight considering possible legal issues, Eliot Spitzer ' s biggest problem may not be losing his job. But what comes next potentially in court. Martha, back to you. @!MACCALLUM : We will get to more of that later. Thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on FOX, our next guest is assuming the duties of New York 's lieutenant governor, Spitzer 's arch-nemesis, New York Senate majority leader Joe Bruno in his first national TV interview since Spitzer step down. And, sir, good evening to you. Thank you for your time in Albany. @!JOE-BRUNO-@1R-NY@ : Good evening, Bill. @!HEMMER : Take me back to the past few days. When you first heard about these allegations, what was your first thought? @!BRUNO : Disbelief. I really thought that somebody was playing some terrible joke. And really, just shocked when we became aware that it was for real, that these things were really unwinding, and then, you know, you think in terms of what do you do about it and how do you go forward and how do you do your job? @!HEMMER : Yes. Has he telephoned you, or would you even expect that? @!BRUNO : He did not. I talked to just about everybody but him, and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you commented, since a year ago or over a year ago, he has seen me as his real rival and he 's done everything within his power to get me out of office and using the state police in allegedly, really, what can be a criminal way. So, we talked a week before, but he really would n't have been calling me as one of his colleagues and best friends. That 's for sure. @!HEMMER : I think the people living here in New York have a pretty good understanding of your relationship with Eliot Spitzer, but for the rest of the country, how would you describe it? @!BRUNO : Well, it was not productive -- is the best way. I tried everything in every way I could from January and February of last year to get along with him, talked with him, talked with him like a Dutch uncle. I 've been around for some years. He was new. I said you got to be a CEO, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prosecutor. You ca n't step all over people. He then comes out that he 's( INAUDIBLE) steam roller, he 's going to crush anyone who stands in his way, starting with me, starting with my Republican conference. And so it 's quickly became unproductive in terms of trying to partner and govern. I did the best that I could, but I have n't talked with him until last week since probably July. @!HEMMER : Given that answer, you know, do you consider this a relief? Do you feel like the state government can be more effective now? @!BRUNO : Yes, absolutely. It is a relief. I feel very badly for Silda, his wife, his children, his family, and he said the right words, that he 's going to heal himself and heal his relationship with the family. That 's the right place for him to be mentally and emotionally. And I wish him the best in that regard, that he can put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But we are elected to govern, so we 're going forward trying to get a budget down, as we 're supposed to, constitutionally, by the end of this month. It 's been a distraction, no question about it, and very, very difficult to deal with the real world around here, but -- so, this is a relief. We get some certainty, the Constitution is pretty clear in the transition, David Paterson was a colleague of mine in the Senate, and I consider him a real colleague where we can govern, we can partner. You 'll see a whole different attitude. You wo n't see this aggressiveness and this kind of intimidation on his part. So, I look forward to getting things done and getting results on behalf of the people of this state who truly need assistance. @!HEMMER : First on FOX tonight. We certainly appreciate your mind. I know you got a lot of interviews coming up later this evening. Joe Bruno, thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Attorney 's Office says that there was no deal that was cut, and this is very significant, with the outgoing governor, so what charges, what does that mean? What is he still facing and could he end up in jail? Here now, former New York Congressman Rick Lazio ; and former New York prosecutor Lisa Pinto. Welcome to both of you. Lisa, let me start with you. Significant I thought that shortly after this announcement from him, the prosecutor 's office said no, we reached no deal. So, what does that mean for him? @!LISA-PINTO-FORMER : Well, he has to cooperate. Usually when there is money laundering conspiracy such as the one alleged here, the johns come forward and they cooperate. They agree to plea to a felony and then they will testify against the operators of the ring, and that will get them - keep them out of jail. I believe he 's going to have to eat a felony here. I believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he did and what he knew about the ring. And I think he 's extremely liable for the money laundering issues because he can not in good conscience say to a jury, I really did n't know that the QAT shell corporation and the Emperor prostitution enterprise were linked. I really thought QAT was a legitimate business enterprise. He ca n't do that. He 's not a regular Joe. He 's a guy with financial savvy and as the wiretap indicates, with all his conversations, he knew exactly what was going on. He talks about the payment. @!MACCALLUM : So, let 's hear the worst scenario, do n't we? So, these are federal criminal charges that carry specific mandates and guidelines for sentencing. What kind of time could he face? @!PINTO : Theoretically, five years, but I do n't think that 's going to happen. But he could do five years or more. It depends if he 's found guilty of the violation of Mann Act, violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual act of prostitution. All that together? Is it consecutive? Is it concurrent? He could do a lot of time. I do n't think that 's going to happen. @!MACCALLUM : All right. That 's what a lot of folks are saying tonight though. Lisa, thank you. Let 's get to the political side of this. Rick, you 'd just heard Joe Bruno. He said, to a certain extent, this is a relief. This is a man who called himself a steam roller and rolled over just about everybody. What 's the thinking now in New York state politics? @!RICK-LAZIO-@1R@2- : I think that the tone will change in Albany which will be positive. It will be a better chance for David Paterson, for people to come together and try to address some of the problems that Eliot Spitzer came to office promising he would address : lowering Medicaid, bringing jobs, lowering taxes, addressing health care and transportation and education. And it 's important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval numbers were around 20 percent He was really struggling even before this announcement took place. @!MACCALLUM : That 's a pretty quick fall because you 've been there for 14 months and he was brought in on a very strong mandate when he was elected. He did hint today, he said that he would come back and work for the common good. Do you think he imagines a further political career for himself? @!LAZIO : You know, I ca n't imagine. Eliot Spitzer is a smart man. He 's got to understand the dimensions of this. To me, he 's got about as much political potential as Jim McGreevey. So, I think he needs to move past this and there 's a lot of different ways in which he can contribute. He 's been a public servant. People have criticized him for some of his tactics, but he 's also done some things really well. And there 's going to be a lot of different ways in life, and I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a difference and be positive without actually having to hold office. The state has got great needs right now. And you know, I 'm hoping that people pull together. @!MACCALLUM : All right. Rick Lazio and Lisa Pinto, thank you very much. Bill. @!HEMMER : There is a FOX News Alert now from our election headquarters. Geraldine Ferraro, you heard her yesterday in her first national TV interview about these controversial comments about Barack Obama. She is now stepping down as a member of the finance committee of Hillary Clinton. There is a lot of heat from a number of corners yesterday and again today. Ferraro is defending her comments saying that Obama would not be where he is if he were a white man or a woman. Much more on this coming up in a few moments here, Geraldine Ferraro is stepping down from the finance committee of Hillary Clinton. In the meantime : Clinton 's loss is Barack Obama ' s gain yet again. The Illinois senator picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night. And as we know, every delegate really does count in this race. Tonight : Obama is in his home state and Clinton is in the nation 's capital. Major Garrett is there live now with more. Hey, Major. @!MAJOR-GARRETT-FOX : Hey, Bill. We 'll get to the delegates in a minute. Today, on the campaign trail, since there are two battles play themselves out. One for image and one for pledged delegates. The image one first : Barack Obama was in Chicago posing with about 10 former military commanders to suggest very strongly, visually at least that he 's a proper commander in chief, completely ready for the job. And said one of the reasons he is, is because he had the correct judgment to oppose the Iraq war and Hillary Clinton did not. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SEN-BARACK-OBAMA- : And the most important national security question since the cold war, I 'm the only candidate who opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning. The judgment was not about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America would go to war in Iraq. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : The other war today or battle that is to say was over pledged delegates. In order to close Obama ' s lead in pledged delegates, one that grew larger after yesterday 's victory in Mississippi, Senator Clinton needs delegates from Florida and Michigan primaries and she needs them to be counted by the Democratic National Committee. Today, she said so, emphatically. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SEN-HILLARY-CLINTO : The results of those primaries were fair and they should be honored. Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of discussion about what we should do to ensure that the voters in Florida and Michigan are counted. Well, in my view, there are two options. Honor the results or hold new primary elections. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : The negotiations about what to do with Florida and Michigan 's delegates are stalled, and the debate over them and who is the more fit commander in chief, well, that 's going to continue -- location : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, April 22nd as you mentioned there. Major, thanks. Major Garrett in Washington. Now, Martha. @!MACCALLUM : All right, Bill. Well, coming up next : The Pennsylvania primary. Barack Obama is downplaying his chances in the state these days, while Hillary Clinton is basically banking on it. Her camp is saying, quote, " The path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, well, it goes right through the state of Pennsylvania. " @!FOX-News-Washingto# BRIT @!HUME, FOX NEWS : Hi, Martha. @!MACCALLUM : So, are they right? Do you have to win Pennsylvania to win this nomination and go on to win the presidency? @!HUME : Maybe not. Look, whether he wins Pennsylvania or not, Barack Obama will undoubtedly get a lot of delegates out of Pennsylvania, making it very difficult for Senator Clinton to make much of a headway, make much headway against his delegate lead, and in the end, of course, the delegates are what count. So, the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't win Pennsylvania, you ca n't win the presidency. That there 's a couple of things wrong with that argument. One of them is, of course, that it pre- supposes that inability to win a state or among Democrats only, means you ca n't win the state when it 's Democrats versus Republican nominee in the fall. I do n't think that follows. I do n't think anybody thinks that follows but it sounds kind of good. Obama can just basically argue that all the red states that he 's winning, which have gone for the Bush-Cheney team the last two times around, will that put them in play for the Democrats. I do n't think that 's necessarily true either. So, it 's all just gamesmanship and sort of silliness here. Obama is going to go where he can get the most delegates and Hillary Clinton appears to be doing the same thing and their emphasis on Pennsylvania, the state that is a demographically kind of designed for her is understandable. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to win the nomination. You don't. @!MACCALLUM : You know, Brit, let 's look at landscape here, you got six weeks to go before the Pennsylvania primary. So, there 's a lot of time, some people say time is on Hillary 's side. She 's sort of successfully changed a bit of the discussion to having a little bit more scrutiny on Barack Obama. Does that feel like it has traction to you or it has been going by the wayside? @!HUME : Well, look, Barack Obama had a pretty easy run in the press for a long period of time, and the Clinton campaign complained about it and not without justification to complain about that, and the scrutiny of Barack Obama has gotten a little more intense, as well it should have. In addition, of course, you got John McCain out there with nobody on the Republican side to campaign against in a position to take shots at either or both of them, which I might add as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all, a rather limited national record to run on. And that of course is why you saw him trying to bolster his credentials there with the bunch of military figures today, as he was talking about foreign policy issues. And of course, casting doubt on Hillary Clinton by saying as he does over and over again that she after all voted for this war while he was opposed to it. @!MACCALLUM : All right, Brit. Thank you very much. Good to see you. We 'll see you back right there at the top of the hour. Thank you. @!HUME : Thanks, Martha. @!HEMMER : In the meantime : A lot of people are wondering : What was he thinking? A former sex addict will explain why Eliot Spitzer would risk everything, his career and his marriage for paid sex? That 's coming up. @!MACCALLUM : Good question. Then, this continues, folks. Geraldine Ferraro stepping down from Hillary Clinton 's campaign over remarks she made about Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that story for you plus more sights and sounds tonight from the campaign trail, including John McCain 's idea of an ideal running mate. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SEN-JOHN-MCCAIN-@ : My criteria( INAUDIBLE) someone who shares your principles, your values and your vision and your priorities is who you want.( INAUDIBLE). That 's all. Of course, it 's much less a factor given my( INAUDIBLE). @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MACCALLUM : Coming up : New tonight, John McCain says he 's getting the impression that Mitt Romney wants to be his running mate. We 're going to get reaction from FOX 's Sean Hannity. Plus : What Sean is going to ask McCain when he meets with him tomorrow? @!HEMMER : Breaking news in the war between one of Hillary Clinton 's supporters and the Obama campaign. Geraldine Ferraro, under fire for saying that Obama has been doing well in the race because he is black, has just stepped down from Hillary Clinton 's finance committee. Obama today is accusing Ferraro in participating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Clinton supporter, Ferraro is saying that Obama ' s campaign has been twisting her remarks but has resigned nonetheless, moments ago. Here 's what she said earlier today when I talked to her on AMERICA 'S NEWSROOM. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!GERALDINE-FERRARO, : I 'm sorry. I said nothing negative. I care about the black vote in this country. I am absolutely thrilled by his campaign( AUDIO BREAK) and I really do n't this is right that they should attack me as racist. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : All right. That was earlier. Now, tonight, reaction to this breaking news, Maryland 's former lieutenant governor and FOX News contributor Michael Steele. Hello, Michael. Good evening to you. @!MICHAEL-STEELE-@1 : Hey, Bill. What 's up, man? @!HEMMER : I 'm fine, thank you. First, where are you on this issue? @!STEELE : Well, you know, I have to admit that there 's some legitimacy to what she says. It does n't go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very valid point. There is not a white person or black person, and certainly, I have talked to a lot, where that has been in the back of their mind or what 's been expressed explicitly. Now, keep in mind, it does n't diminish the value of his candidacy. It does n't take away from what Barack has done. It just speaks to the fact that race, no matter how you dance it, no matter how you dice it, it 's still a part of the life and culture and the politics of this nation, and we 've got to stop pretending that all of a sudden we 're now in nirvana and everybody is getting along to go along. That 's just not the case. @!HEMMER : The point I made to her this morning is, I do n't hear people who are supporters of him saying that I like him because he 's black. I hear people saying because he talks about hopes and dreams and it all sounds really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounds good. @!STEELE : Right. @!HEMMER : Now Obama was asked about that. Roll this tape here and we 'll get your reaction, Michael. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!OBAMA- : The notion that it is a great advantage to me, to be an African-American named Barack Obama and pursue the presidency, I think, is not a view that has been commonly shared by the general public. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : He went on to say that my name and my skin color would not be in the asset column when it comes to running for the president. That 's a pretty good line. @!STEELE : Well, it 's a good line but it 's the truth and it 's a reality. Look, Bill, when I ran for the United States Senate, we did a poll, we asked two questions : Would you vote for an African-American for United States Senate? Seventy percent of Marylanders at the time said yes. The next question, would your neighbor vote for an African-American for the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still this tension, there 's that divide that exists when it comes to race. And I think that Barack 's campaign helps open up that discussion, but every time you take that step, you have more casualties of that conversation, and we 've got to get past that point where we can actually have an open discussion about this. And not hang someone 's hat on the wall. @!HEMMER : What she insists is that we 're over the top in this country when it comes to the topic of race. Are we over the top -- entirely sensitive, too sensitive? @!STEELE : Yes. I think that, I mean, to the point where you can not engage on it, you can not discuss it. And it 's one of the questions that, quite frankly, Republicans are going to have to deal with as we go forward if Barack is the nominee. @!HEMMER : Michael Steele, good to have you on. All right, former lieutenant governor in Maryland, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in Washington, back here in New York now and over to Martha. @!MACCALLUM : All right, Bill. Thank you very much. Will Dr. Death turns to politics? Assisted suicide champion Jack Kevorkian just announcing his plans to run for Congress in the state of Michigan, intending to be a candidate with no party affiliation representing Detroit 's suburbs, he says. The " right to die " advocate says he just wants honesty and sincerity in government. Kevorkian was just released from prison last year after serving more than eight years for second degree murder. And he had to know, Eliot Spitzer, that it could cost him his career. So, why could n't New York 's governor control his sexual appetite? A reformed sex addict weighs in on this, and this question tonight : Did Eliot Spitzer ' s wife really not know what her husband was up to for all those years? We 're going to talk about that next, coming up on AMERICA 'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS at FOX NEWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS at FOX News. And here 's what we 're watching right now. Eliot Spitzer resigned today. The New York governor is stepping down after being caught in a sex sting operation. He apologized to his family and the people of New York. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!SPITZER : I have insisted, I believe correctly, that people, regardless of their position or power, take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MACCALLUM : And there it is, Lt. Gov. David Paterson will take over the position on Monday. And Hillary Clinton speaking to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. today. Clinton promising comprehensive immigration reform and better business opportunities for women and minorities in America if she 's elected president. Barack Obama playing down the chances that he will win the primary in Pennsylvania on April 22. Instead, he is focusing on states that he thinks are more likely to support him and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!HEMMER : OK. Sex, lies and a phone tap. After a decade of alleged infidelity, the Democratic governor 's secret is now out. Spitzer 's enemies tonight are saying good riddance. And others are just trying to understand how a smart man could take such a stupid chance. FOX 's Douglas Kennedy just spoke to someone who says he thinks he knows why. Tell us. @!DOUGLAS-KENNEDY-F : Yes, Spitzer did a lot of damage to himself, Bill. He also tragically did damage to his wife and three kids. And to most, his behavior is inexplicable. But there are some who say they understand. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @(voice-over) : Brian Brevig is a self-described recovering sex addict. He says watching Eliot Spitzer is like watching himself. @(on-camera) : So how do you identify with Eliot Spitzer? @!BRIAN-BREVIG-RECO : Well, I can identify, because, you know, as a sex addict, it can take you to the absolute depths of hell. For years, Brian said he spent much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes. @!KENNEDY : So why pay for it? @!BREVIG : Well, I think, you know, when you pay for it, it makes it that much more exciting, I mean, the exchange of money, the exchange of power. I mean money has a lot of power and sex has a lot of power. @!KENNEDY-@1voice-ov : Spitzer is said to have paid over $80,000 over a ten-year period on high-priced hookers in New York, Washington and Florida. One of those classy call girls talked about her experience with the soon-to-be ex-governor to the " New York Post, " describing him as a big tipper. Still, it was Spitzer himself who seems to have gotten himself caught, by trying to hide the prostitute 's payments, dividing a $140,000 tab into smaller amounts to avoid federal reporting rules. @!SPITZER : I 'm deeply did not live up to what was expected of me. @!KENNEDY : He also allegedly asked the bank to take his name off the wire transfer, which the bank quickly reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-destructive. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE- : What I 'm saying he is should have known better but he was so obsessed, I guess, with this feeling of invincibility. He must have felt infallible. @!KENNEDY : And Spitzer may also have been self-destructive with the sex itself. FBI sources confirming today the governor asked to pay more for sex without a condom. Brian says that 's typical. @(on-camera) : Why would you want to have unsafe sex with a prostitute? @!BREVIG : It makes it more real. It makes it more exciting. It 's a big risk. @!KENNEDY-@1voice-ov : He says he sought treatment for his sex addiction and he suggests Spitzer do the same. @(on-camera) : So what kind of treatment is there? @!BREVIG : Treatment is available at pretty much any rehab-type place that deals with other types of addictions like a Betty Ford or a Hazelden probably has a specific section for sex addiction. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!KENNEDY : He says there are also 12-step programs that deal with sex addiction. He says in his experience, sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who thinks they have one, Bill, to find someone to talk to. @!HEMMER : Douglas, thank you. I think. Douglas Kennedy in New York. @!MACCALLUM : We 've got some interesting responses from the ladies on this one, folks. So will the Spitzer scandal -But first we 'll get to politics for you - impact the Democratic National Party and how? Here with me now is FOX 's political analyst Kirsten Powers and syndicated radio talk show host, Monica Crowley. We 'll get to that in a second. Let 's talk about the delegate situation, because she 's going to lose one out of all this. @!MONICA-CROWLEY-SY : Oh, yes, never a dull moment. And for Hillary Clinton, she 's facing a pitched battle over the super delegates with Barack Obama, and to lose even one is pretty devastating for her. So when she made that statement today that she was saddened for Spitzer and his family, I 'm sure that 's true because she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself because now she has to go scramble for more support. And do n't forget that Gov. Spitzer was one of her point men, not only in New York, but in the northeast to round up superdelegates to support her. @!MACCALLUM : Yes. It 's a lot for her, Kirsten, you know, on two levels, as Monica points out. The superdelegates and also the reminder to everybody - I mean it went through my mind when I thought of Hillary today, well, she 's been there, too. @!KIRSTEN-POWERS-FO : Well, I think it 's the loss of a superdelegate. I 'd be surprised if this is going to be decided by one superdelegate. So I think the bigger loss is the fact, as Monica says, is that he is, you know, a very powerful person. He was a huge star in the Democratic Party and he had a lot of influence. And could have influenced a lot of people probably if it comes down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more superdelegates. So I think that 's a problem. On the issue of reminding people of things, we do n't know which way that cuts for Hillary. Because remember, she has never been more popular than when she went through this. @!MACCALLUM : Their clients could be sympathetic to her in a way. And we all watched Silda standing there. And that 's what I want to ask you guys about now. When I heard him make the statement today, at one point, he said - in fact, one of the first things he said was that " I would need to seek help for myself. " And I thought, here we go again. We 've got another sort of a rehab situation - it 's not my fault because I was just, you know, born addicted to that. @!CROWLEY : Overtaken by his impulses. Right. So you know he 's going to rehab and then the second stop will be Barbara Walters. I mean you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that for Hillary Clinton, it actually is very interesting because it does remind people of her sex scandal baggage with her husband. On the other hand, she ca n't make this argument but her surrogates can. Look, male politicians, they 're thinking with a different set of brains here. And then it almost always ends up with either an intern or a hooker. Therefore, it is time for a woman president. @!MACCALLUM : You know what? That 's an interesting point, because when I talked to Dr. Keith Ablow about this last night, I said, " How often do we see this with female candidates? " @!CROWLEY : Never. @!MACCALLUM : It 's almost never. @!POWERS : Yes. I mean I can not think of a time when a female candidate or governor or member of congress was taken down by a sex scandal. @!CROWLEY : It has n't happened. @!POWERS : Yes. @!MACCALLUM : You know, the other thing that came up and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well, is the question of whether or not Silda knew before, and this obviously just all of us speculating. She is obviously a very smart woman. She could, you know, go through all those legal papers and advise her husband on what he should do. But do you get the feeling that she know about this? @!POWERS : I would think something has been going on as long as they say it has been going on. It 's certainly possible that she would know. It 's possible that they 've maybe worked through it. If he says he 's a sex addict, maybe they - When you think of other people, Michael Douglas is I think the most famous sex addict. And he and his wife have gone through all sorts of counseling to try to get over it. And then I guess he 's cured now because I have n't heard anything about with Catherine Zeta-Jones. So( UNINTELLIGIBLE). @!MACCALLUM : But you know, in terms of Silda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, you wonder if she had that look on her face today of, you know, " We 've been dealing with this, but now I have to deal with the fact that everyone else now knows. " @!CROWLEY : And look, you never know what is going on internally between two people in a relationship or what kind of deals that they have struck. And it 's entirely possible that she did know, and her big issue was that he got caught, that he was indiscreet, which is I think was Hillary Clinton 's problem with Bill getting caught with Monica Lewinsky was all about. @!MACCALLUM : Yes. That 's an interesting point. All right. Thank you very much, ladies. It is always good to talk to both of you. @!HEMMER : I 'm here tonight to defend an innocent man( UNINTELLIGIBLE). For the record, Hillary Clinton putting new pressure now on Barack Obama to hold these fresh primaries in Florida and Michigan. Why Obama is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll explain that and more sights and sounds from the trail, including a lighter moment from Bill Clinton. Listen and watch here. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BILL-CLINTON-FORM : I know whenever I go someplace and speak for - people sort of discount what I say. They say, " He 's got to say those nice things or he could n't go home tonight. " @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!HEMMER : Hillary Clinton, while stepping up the pressure to hold these fresh primary elections in Florida and Michigan as Barack Obama extends his lead in the delegate race, oh so slightly, after a win last night in Mississippi. Clinton says there are two options - honor the ballots of two million people from January or hold them all anew, period. Florida 's trying to figure this out - well, trying to figure out if, too, they can conduct a re-do. And perhaps, if you do it, do you do it by mail? Listen, the clock is running. The calendar is ticking off, too, day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary Clinton, Lisa Caputo is here in the studio tonight. Good evening to you. @!LISA-CAPUTO-FORME : Good evening. @!HEMMER : Also working as an advisor for the Clinton campaign. How do you solve this? @!CAPUTO : Well, I think this is clearly a difficult thing to solve. I think that the right thing to do, just as just stepping back as a political person myself is to hold some kind of a re-do. The question is what kind of re-do do you hold? Do you hold caucuses? Do you hold primaries or have write-ins? I think there has already been the notion of a write-in and the Obama campaign has objected. They 're afraid of voter fraud. The Clinton campaign would prefer not to have caucuses because the Obama campaign has fared well in caucuses - @!HEMMER : Seemed to do better in that, yes. @!CAPUTO : So it would seem to me that the way to go would be to hold primaries both in Michigan and in Florida. @!HEMMER : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that. @!CAPUTO : Well, I think sure they would like that, but I think that really, Bill, we 're in a situation where it is so close and Barack Obama is ahead on pledged delegates, but it 's close. It 's a difference of about 100 and some odd delegates. @!HEMMER : And you wonder in the end whether you do a re-vote in Michigan and Florida if it really separates the two that much. About two hours ago, Robert Wexler, a congressman from Florida was on the FOX NEWS Channel. I listened to this guy minute after minute. I could not figure out what his solution was, which told me he does n't have one. The process, the method, the mailing, the money - this is a real fix for the Democratic Party. @!CAPUTO : It 's tough. You know, clearly, I think that the party would rather not be in this situation. But you can not discount two very important states. Michigan clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida, we know what the history with Florida has been in past presidential elections. So these are two states where the voices of the voters should be heard. The question is, how do you do that? @!HEMMER : You 're sure - and the house Democrats from Florida saying they do n't want a re-do anyway by the greater majority of them. @!CAPUTO : No, but then you have the governor of Florida saying - @!HEMMER : Who 's a Republican, saying, let 's play ball. @!CAPUTO : I think, you know, this will cost money. And the question on the table is whether both campaigns can raise the money to independently finance a quote, unquote, " re-do. " @!HEMMER : Is it five or six million dollars? What is that? @!CAPUTO : I think it 's like closer to $10 million if I had to bet. @!HEMMER : In Florida alone. Lisa, nice to see you tonight. @!CAPUTO : Nice to see you, too. @!HEMMER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill, this question, what will John McCain do to win over the conservatives who are not with him yet? FOX 's own Sean Hannity will ask the presidential hopeful that in an exclusive interview. Sean joins us live moments from now in a preview of that when AMERICA 'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS, next on FOX NEWS Channel. @!MACCALLUM : Well, it is 24 hours now and none of us can wait. FOX 's Sean Hannity is about to interview the man that he and other conservative radio hosts have been very skeptical about for months on the air, Republican presidential nominee John McCain. Tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, the two of them will sit down, one-on-one, and talk about whether McCain will reach out to conservatives in his party who have some major concerns still about his politics. Sean is with me now live on the phone for a preview of what he is going to ask him. Good evening Sean. Good to have you here. @!SEAN-HANNITY-CONS : Hey, Martha. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you? @!MACCALLUM : I 'm great, thanks. You know, you have said that the two of you, you and John McCain, that you get along, that you think, you know, he is a good guy. But, listen, he was never your pick in this nomination, so now you 're going to sit down with him. You tend not to change your mind about how you feel about things and neither does he. So where does that leave us tomorrow night? @!HANNITY : Well, you know, it is - First of all, I have always admired Sen. McCain. It 's actually on the eve of the 31st anniversary when he was released from Vietnam, so we 'll talk about that. Look, you can not help but admire his record, his background, his life, his service to his country. He has been right on issues like the surge. If we go back to his CPAC speech, Martha, he said he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party and that he said he would. He said that he knew that he could n't win without conservatives. We 'll talk about exactly what that means. You know, it 's interesting. Over the years, we 've had this relationship where, you know, he is known as a maverick and as an independent and somebody that has his own mind. But over the years, we have also debated the issues of McCain-Feingold and McCain-Kennedy, so there is no surprise that he and I have some disagreements. But, you know, on measure, he has been right on the war. He made a pledge recently not to raise taxes, to eliminate earmarks. We 'll talk about judges and some other issues. And I think it will be a friendly discussion. I can guarantee you that, but I think one that 's really important to conservatives. @!MACCALLUM : So does that mean - it sounds to me like you 're finding some common ground. Are you happy in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enthusiastically go out and back and try to build support for him? @!HANNITY : I think Sen. McCain - I think this is his opportunity more than mine. And in as much as I think there are conservatives out there, there is no hope for Barack Obama or Sen. Clinton to win over the conservative vote. That 's not going to happen. I think for Sen. McCain, I think he was right when he spoke at CPAC, he highlighted his conservative credentials, those areas where we do agree. And I think he has an opportunity to maybe clarify or talk about issues like judges and immigration. And if he 's going to focus on McCain- Kennedy, or is he just going to focus on securing the borders? What kind of judges he would appoint to the Supreme Court? Does he really mean it when he says no new taxes. You know, is that a George Herbert Walker Bush no-new-tax fudge? So I think those will be areas of significance. @!MACCALLUM : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made your differences. I talked to Newt Gingrich the other night. He basically said, " Look, if he 's tough on terror, if he picks conservative judges and sticks by the tax plan, I 'm onboard. " Are there areas that you - What is your toughest point of contention with him and what do you expect you 're going to hear from him tomorrow night? @!HANNITY : I think certainly one of them is immigration. Another one is McCain-Feingold. I would like to examine other issues, for example, like Anwar and drilling and energy independence and eliminating the death tax - issues that have come up throughout his career. For example, we 'll examine the issue of - he at one time talked about some class warfare stuff. And when he voted against the Bush tax cuts, he had said, " Well, it would benefit the wealthy too much. " @!MCCALLUM : Right. @!HANNITY : I 'll ask him about all those things. But look, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for. I think there 's an opportunity here for Sen. McCain, who does pride himself in reaching across the aisle to work with people like Russ Feingold and Ted Kennedy. And one of things I will ask him is what does that mean? What does it mean to reach across the aisle? What does it mean in terms of reaching toward your base? How will you try to reunite them? So, I 'm very interested in some of the answers. @!MACCALLUM : All right, Sean. And I know you 're going to ask him about Mitt Romney, too, so that 's going to be the tee that we 're going to put out there. We 're going to talk about that as well with the VP issue. Sean 's exclusive interview with John McCain airs tomorrow night on " @!HANNITY &amp; COLMES " at 9:00 Eastern, right here on the FOX NEWS Channel. Sean, thank you. Do n't miss a moment. @!HEMMER : All right. In meantime, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when talking about Clinton and Obama. Are we entering the political nice zone? And is that what Americans want after all? Political reaction coming up right after this. @!HEMMER : All right. We have seen the jabs go back and forth for months now. But it seems that John McCain is taking the high ground here, asking supporters to drop the personal attacks against his Democratic rivals, His campaign manager telling everyone backing McCain to stay positive a and do n't take the low road. Is America used to this? Former Ohio congressman, FOX 's contributor, John Kasich is with us from Columbus. Hello, John. @!FMR-REP-JOHN-KASIC : Hey, Bill. @!HEMMER : What do you make of this? Are we ready to be nice? @!KASICH : No, no. What I make of it is they 're doing the work of the Republicans. They 're pounding one another in the McCain camp and the strategists are sitting back looking to see where they 're drawing blood on each other. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall campaign. So it would be really silly for McCain to start attacking them, because he does n't even know who the nominee is. But let me tell you, when we get in the fall, the campaign does n't have to be personal - the attacks do n't have to be personal, but they are going to be striking, Bill, because we 're running for president of the United States. And you need to show why you 're better than the other person, your positive program and where they fall short, where their philosophy is different. So I do n't think it will get real personal. It will, at times, but it will be intense. And now, the Republicans are enjoying this. @!HEMMER : Well, is it your suggestion then that McCain will change his attitude, because anytime someone goes after and offends somebody, McCain always pulls them back. That 's been the pattern, John. @!KASICH : Wait a minute. Look, maybe on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But let me tell you, if Obama is the nominee, he 's going to go after him on the fact that the guy has no experience. If Hillary is the nominee, I mean he 's going to talk about her failed healthcare plan and how she screwed things up. I mean that 's the way it 's going to go. It wo n't have to be personal. But he 'll wait until the fall to do that. And then he 's watching to see what is really working. Hillary attacking Obama on experience - it 's really working, and then they 're going to pick that kind of thing up. We will see how Obama comes back and hits Hillary. That 's where we are. @!HEMMER : I 've got about 15 seconds, John. Do you think Americans like to see these politicians mix it up? @!KASICH : Yes, you know, at the end of the day, comparison ads are important. They move the numbers, and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the positive, but they 're comparing products. And in anything, the public responds, and that 's how campaigns respond to what the public wants. @!HEMMER : That 's like, show us what you 've got. John Kasich - good to you have on, John. Take care of Ohio. @!KASICH : Thank you both. @!MACCALLUM : All right. Thanks for being with us and watching this special edition of AMERICA 'S ELECTION HEADQUARTERS. I 'm Martha MacCallum. @!HEMMER : And I 'm Bill Hemmer. Have a great evening. See you tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m., back here at 5:00 in Eastern Time. In the meantime, here is Brit Hume, live, " SPECIAL REPORT " in Washington. Here 's Brit. '
