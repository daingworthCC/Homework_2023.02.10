ROBERT KRULWICH, ABC News : How do I know- they do n't have clothes. You did n't tell me that. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over It 's a world where fantasies run free, right at your fingertips. It was Hank Aaron 's moment of glory. BASEBALL GAME ANNOUNCER : There 's a new home run champion of all time. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Or was it? HANK AARON : To this moment I do n't think about it, because of some of the scars I guess in left in me. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Hank Aaron talks about racial harassment and death threats while he was chasing Babe Ruth 's record. DARRELL EVANS, Atlanta Braves, 1969-1976 : It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still crazy now. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Bobby Muller survived a war to start a movement. BOBBY MULLER : Being given, you know, a second chance at life, my reaction to that has always been one of absolute gratitude, and I got a real wake-up call in Vietnam. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over And he made a friend along the way. MICHEL McQUEEN, ABC News : Born in the USA, you know, the cool-rocking daddy of the USA? He says that 's about him. Is that true? BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN : Sure is. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Now Bobby Muller 's back in the war zone, fighting a weapon that continues to kill @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News, Forrest Sawyer, Sheila MacVicar, John Hockenberry, Michel McQueen, John McKenzie, Lloyd Kramer, and Robert Krulwich- this is Day One. Cybersex FORREST SAWYER : We begin tonight on the road to the future. It is called the information superhighway, and it starts right in your living room. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible just a few years ago. There is a lot of chat about technology and business. You 'd expect that. But some of the conversation might surprise you. It is not just tech talk. They are talking about sex. Robert Krulwich eavesdrops tonight on the world of cybersex. ROBERT KRULWICH, ABC News : voice-over It does n't look like an information superhighway, but up this road, deep in the Ozark Mountains, people from all over the world are linking their computers together and doing business right here. This is the world headquarters of Laura 's Lair, a computer service for adults only, and this is the company 's chief executive, not him, but her, Laura @!LAURA Well, I just have to ask you a couple of questions. The first one is, are you an adult? ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over What she does is, she loads pictures, mostly X-rated pictures, into her computer, and then customers anywhere in the world can call up Laura 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,000 descriptions of photos in language that 's not always suitable for TV. interviewing Wait, here. ' Veronica Attacks Theresa. ' We can- now, what- LAURA : Right, that 's crosstalk. ROBERT KRULWICH : Now, well, do n't run it yet @!LAURA Right. ROBERT KRULWICH : ' Veronica Attacks Theresa, ' what would that be about? Would that be hugging, or something nice? LAURA : Probably someone tickling somebody else. ROBERT KRULWICH : All right. Let 's try it. voice-over Now, Laura 's customers pay to transfer these photos from her computer, through the phone lines, to their computer @!LAURA Okay, here it comes. ROBERT KRULWICH : Okay. How do I know? Oh, okay, so, this is a little bit more than a tickle, actually @!LAURA Yeah. ROBERT KRULWICH : In fairness, slightly more than a tickle @!LAURA Yeah, well, they do n't have clothes on. ROBERT KRULWICH : They do n't have clothes on. You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of Veronica? LAURA : They 're gone. ROBERT KRULWICH : Okay, well, that was a very interesting experience. Excuse me while I stop sweating @!LAURA Sorry. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over There are thousands of adult bulletin boards like Laura 's. To sign up, all you need is a personal computer that connects to a telephone, and then you subscribe, just like to a magazine, for, say, $40 a year or so, and when Laura sends a picture from her computer to your computer, that picture is yours forever, it 's in your computer. You can look at it, create your own fantasies, whatever you want @!LAURA All right. In this one, now, I 'm laying on top of a truck. ROBERT KRULWICH : Of a truck. Well, let's- who is the ' I, ' by the way? LAURA : Me. ROBERT KRULWICH : You are on this? LAURA : Yeah. ROBERT KRULWICH : You put yourself on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I look like, too. ROBERT KRULWICH : Oh, my God. All right, yes- LAURA : I 'm happy to show them. ROBERT KRULWICH : -all right, let 's see what you look like on a truck. There you are, on a truck, with a little Laura 's Lair insignia @!LAURA Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. ROBERT KRULWICH : Well, that 's nice. And are you always, uh, fully clothed on top of the truck? LAURA : No. ROBERT KRULWICH : Oh. Well, so in addition to managing this and building the computers, and collecting the clients and paying the bills, you are also a model? LAURA : Right. Mm-hmm. ROBERT KRULWICH : I do n't even know what to ask you next. Does your husband also model occasionally? LAURA : Yeah, he has. ROBERT KRULWICH : In- on a truck, or more? LAURA : More. ROBERT KRULWICH : More? LAURA : Mm-hmm. ROBERT KRULWICH : Oh @!LAURA It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fun to do. ROBERT KRULWICH : I see, all right, very interesting @!LAURA Nothing to be ashamed of. ROBERT KRULWICH : No, I was just trying to remember my name. voice-over Laura 's Lair is only one of tens of thousands of new businesses connecting people and computers. Mary Kathleen Flynn covers this technology for U.S. News &amp; World Report. interviewing Is it just sex that all these people are doing on these computer services? MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : Not by a long shot. People are looking up the health care reform documents- ROBERT KRULWICH : Well, that ai n't sex. MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : No, it 's not. ROBERT KRULWICH : Is this growing business? Is this a growing business? MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : It 's been growing tremendously, you know. Right now there are five million people on commercial online services. Five years ago there were about one million. Compuserve is saying that it 's getting 80,000 new members each month. ROBERT KRULWICH : So people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLYNN : And they 're getting stock quotes, and they 're searching databases of information for market research. ROBERT KRULWICH : Well, I have a- I have, in a book that I have, I have a list of just subjects on something called The Well, which is one of these services. Just listen to this. Explain what this might mean. ' Space creatures ate my modem, ' is the name of a- MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : Sounds like a sci-fi forum, to me. ROBERT KRULWICH : ' Anxiety in the modern world, ' ' The aquarium and related hobbies. ' Are there groups this small, of people? MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : Oh, yeah. Yeah. There are- ROBERT KRULWICH : People are talking about archery? MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : People will talk about anything. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over But the most popular topic on thousands of services is still sex. This company, Event Horizons, in Oregon, had gross sales of $3.2 million last year. Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is buying this stuff? on camera Well, Laura says they are overwhelmingly men, they earn about $40,000 a year, and they 're aged between 35 and 45, on average, and they live and phone her from places like London, Liverpool, Tokyo, Tartu, Estonia, Kalamazoo, Waco, and one of her customers, she tells us, is Harvey Weinstein, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, in fact, right here in this yellow house. voice-over Over the computer, on what Laura calls her chat line, we asked Harvey to describe himself. He wrote, let 's see, ' I 'm five-ten, 165 pounds, with dirty blonde hair, ' and he said he was a programmer. When we got upstairs, this is the Harvey we met. interviewing How much time do you spend dialing up these bulletin board systems? HARVEY WEINSTEIN : Oh, BBS 's, in general, I 'd say between five and eight hours a week. ROBERT KRULWICH : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year, online doing this? HARVEY WEINSTEIN : Anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000. ROBERT KRULWICH : Two thousand dollars? HARVEY WEINSTEIN : Possibly as much as that. ROBERT KRULWICH : And how many pictures do you have in your collection? HARVEY WEINSTEIN : Pictures, I 'd say I probably have in excess of 2,000. ROBERT KRULWICH : Two thousand? HARVEY WEINSTEIN : Mm-hmm. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over And a lot of them are of Laura. interviewing Now, what do you do with the Laura pictures? to Laura He collects them. voice-over Does any of this embarrass Laura? LAURA : No, I 'm not embarrassed at all. ROBERT KRULWICH : And it does n't give you any qualms- LAURA : There 's nothing to be embarrassed about. ROBERT KRULWICH : -and you do n't think, ' Oh, I wish I were doing something else '? LAURA : No, no, not at all. I do n't find anything wrong with it. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over Even though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the chat on Laura 's Lair. Now, what is chat? Well, simply this. Here I am in the Ozarks with Laura 's assistant, Chelsea, and on her computer I ask a man in London will he talk with us on TV, and he types right back, ' Oh righty oh, no probs. ' This is kind of neat. People like this @!CHELSEA They 're hooked. They ca n't get out of it. They 're hooked. But it- ROBERT KRULWICH : Hooked on what? CHELSEA : Their computer can do anything they want them to do nowadays, even give them a conversation and computer sex. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over And what is computer sex? LAURA : Having sex via text. ROBERT KRULWICH : They 're having sex via text? LAURA : Yeah. They 're typing, ' Ah, oh, moan. ' ROBERT KRULWICH : Okay. Now, let 's see, here. voice-over For example, we once turned on our camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the middle of some heavy typing, and as soon as we said, ' We 're here, ' Vi wrote, ' Okay, got ta go, then. Bye, all. ' Then Squire left, then Juicy left. on camera Everybody else is leaving. voice-over Even though the sex was just words, as this guy wrote, they ' do n't like to do it on camera, ' almost like it was real, which makes you wonder, are people really, you know- CHELSEA : They 're very descriptive on what they 're doing and how they 're feeling. ROBERT KRULWICH : And they 'll say, ' Oh, my gosh, my gosh, yes, yes, yes, I 'm done '? Do they write these things down? CHELSEA : No, they do n't say, ' I 'm done. ' ' That was great, ' ' That was good, ' ' Very satisfied. ' ROBERT KRULWICH : Oh, so you get finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's amazing people feel free to talk this way. MARY KATHLEEN FLYNN : Well, sometimes, what I 've noticed is that people are really freed up by the fact that they- that nobody knows what they look like, or even, unless you choose to tell them, nobody knows what you do for a living or anything about you, what your age is. So I 've seen that people tend to share a lot about themselves, you know, very personal experiences, sometimes much more than you want to know about them, I think because they feel somehow protected. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over Still, Laura believes that new computer services will now grow faster than the X-rated kind @!LAURA Oh, I definitely do. I see that in the future there 'll be less of this file exchange of the X-rated pictures going down. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over The boom 's over, she says. So, in a few years, how will these computer networks and chat lines affect our lives? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the biggest way that it 's different is that it 's more like penpals than anything else. I mean, you know, I had a penpal when I was growing up. She was my cousin who lived in England. I did n't even meet her until I was 20 years old, and we got to know each other through our letters. This is a similar kind of way of communicating, only there 's a lot more of it, and you 're communicating with people all over the world and people that are n't necessarily related to you, I mean, they 're not all your cousins @!LAURA It opens up a whole big window and a whole big door to everybody. ROBERT KRULWICH : voice-over That 's the future, but for the moment, Laura is selling what the customers are buying now. This year, she says, she will make $100,000 selling sex online, just working her small patch on the information superhighway @!LAURA Laura 's BBS. FORREST SAWYER : We should point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's not like broadcasting. But obscenity laws do apply. The more responsible computer services do make an effort to keep children away from adult material, but not all do. And remember, there is no foolproof system. The final safeguard remains in the hands of parents @!ANNOUNCER Still to come on Day One, Bobby Muller went to war in Vietnam. Now he 's repairing the damage of war, with a little help from his friends. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN : Well, I can make a lot of noise, you know, and I can make some money, you know? So that 's what I 'm good for, and if there 's any way that I can kind of, you know, help you out @!ANNOUNCER The battles of Bobby Muller, when Day One continues. Commercial break Muller 's Mission ANNOUNCER : Now from New York, Forrest Sawyer. FORREST SAWYER : If there is one man whose life parallels America 's experience in southeast Asia, it would have to be Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vietnam to do his duty, and when he thought that the mission was misguided, he fought relentlessly against the war. And when Muller came to believe that America had neglected its Vietnam veterans, he fought to give them a voice. And now, in a way, he is still fighting a war in southeast Asia, only this time it 's on a different front. Michel McQueen has the story of Bobby Muller, then and now. BOBBY MULLER : Our generation happened to come of age at a time when this country went to war, and we had a decision, you know, the 27 million men that were draft-eligible during the Vietnam era had to make a decision. What are you going to do when your country goes to war? MICHEL McQUEEN, ABC News : voice-over In 1967, Bobby Muller made that decision. At the age of 21, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. He demanded to be sent to the front lines. BOBBY MULLER : Sort of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we 're the greatest country in the world. So when they say, ' You 've got to go to Vietnam and help those freedom-loving people repel that communist invasion, ' hey, ' Sure, let 's go at it, let 's do what we 've got to do, ' and I went. The reality of that war has stayed with me every day. You know, I know what it is to have people around me die. I know what it is to hear the screams in the recovery room. The most important thing for me in life is dealing with those issues that come out of war, and particularly the Vietnam war. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over A few years ago, Bobby Muller started going back to Vietnam and to Cambodia, as a way to make sense of his experiences there. He wanted to replace his time-frozen images of a land at war. Like Bobby, Cambodia 's people carry the scars of war in ways that anyone can see. In April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the village of Camlo, in Kuang Tre province, Vietnam. A shot through the chest pierced both lungs and severed his spinal cord. But if Vietnam wounded his body, it was Cambodia that marked his soul. BOBBY MULLER : If you can understand how terribly these people have suffered, and the degree of continuing trauma and suffering that 's going on there, if you could do something, you would. RON PODLASKI, former Green Beret : I 've known Bobby Muller when we first came home from Vietnam. He 's dedicated his life to try to let people know there are other ways to deal with conflicts, and that war is not the answer. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over In Cambodia, there are over seven million reminders of war. They are called ' hidden killers, ' land mines. They are responsible for the death and maiming of thousands of Cambodians every year. BOBBY MULLER : You have today in Cambodia a society which is considered to be the most disabled society in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for probably over 40,000 amputees. You can not come to Cambodia and not be impressed by the numbers of people that you see without legs. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over The land mines in Cambodia are the legacy of two decades of war. The Americans, the Vietnamese and various Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge, all planted land mines. Bobby Muller is determined to get rid of them, not just in Cambodia, but everywhere. It is an enormous task. Munitions experts estimate that over 100 million land mines are already in the ground around the world. BOBBY MULLER : Have you found mines literally all over the place? MILITARY OFFICER : Oh, yes, definitely. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Land mines have turned the routine tasks of nation building, like farming and clearing roads, into a deadly challenge. Thousands of acres of land have become unusable. BOBBY MULLER : There was a mine literally right here, another one right down the path there, and look at where this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over To really understand what led Bobby Muller to his latest mission, it helps to return to his earlier ones, on a journey that led from gung-ho warrior to anti-war activist, from blind faith to deep disillusionment, and the struggle for something to believe in. He grew up in Great Neck, Long Island, in a middle-class family with traditional values. He was a good athlete. He played in the Little League and earned college letters in wrestling and track. He loved spending days down at the beach with his friends before joining the Marine Corps. On the form asking his preferred assignment, he wrote, ' Front line infantry, duty station Vietnam. ' BOBBY MULLER : ' Hearts and Minds, ' 1974 documentary I got a colonel that 's flying upstairs, and he 's getting down on me and he 's saying, ' Take the hill, take the hill, take the hill. ' So I popped up behind the lead tank and started to go up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire, and makes sound the ARVN started to split, and that 's when I got it. I said, ' Oh, my God, I 'm hit. ' I could n't believe it, you know. I ca n't believe it, I was really hit. And my first, first thought was Kay, my girl, you know? This is going to sound stupid, but I'm- but my thought was, ' She 'll kill me, ' you know? Here I was, dying, and I was worried that she was going to kill me, you know. My last conscious thought was, ' I ca n't believe it. I 'm dying. On this piece of ground I 'm dying, and I ca n't believe it. ' MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Do you remember when you woke up that day, when you first regained consciousness? BOBBY MULLER : Absolutely. My- I 'll never forget it. I was stunned. I was shocked. I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had of dying. MICHEL McQUEEN : What- what went through your head? BOBBY MULLER : ' I 'm here. I 'm here. I did n't die, ' you know. ' Whew. ' MICHEL McQUEEN : A lot of young people say, ' You know what? I 'd rather be dead than paralyzed. ' BOBBY MULLER : So did I. MICHEL McQUEEN : ' Somebody shoots me, I 'd rather be dead. ' Did you ever feel that way? BOBBY MULLER : Absolutely. I remember so vividly, you know, the conviction I had, and if I were to lose a leg, I 'd rather die. The idea of being a paraplegic was like, forget about it. All I can tell you is that when that moment of truth occurs, you know, and you take that bullet and you 're facing, you know, ' I 'm outta here, ' you 're copping a plea and saying, ' Wait a second, I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've had moments of despair since then. BOBBY MULLER : The first time I cried was my first day in a veterans ' hospital. It was, to me, the end of the line. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over These pictures, taken for Life magazine in 1970, showed the terrible conditions in Muller 's hospital ward. As he lay in the hospital, feeling abandoned and betrayed by the country he had nearly died for, Muller began to question the war for the first time. By the time he left the V.A. hospital a year later, he was a passionate, outspoken convert to the anti-war cause. He began to speak out. BOBBY MULLER : Based on my experience, everything that I 'd understood about Vietnam before I went turned out to be a lie, and the war was an atrocity, you know? Coming back from that and disengaging from the emotions of the battlefield, you know, it took time to, you know, replay all of this and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to say something about it. ' And as I was speaking out about conditions in the hospital, you know, people would say, ' What about the war? ' And I 'd say, ' The war was crazy. ' MICHEL McQUEEN : When you started speaking out against the war, how did people react to you? BOBBY MULLER : People would call me a traitor. And I 'd say, ' Look, it 's harder for me to repudiate the war. Do n't you think I 'd love to be able to wrap myself up in the mantle, you know, of being a hero? Do n't you think I 'd love to be able to say that what happened to me, you know, was for a reason, you know, that it 's a price you 've got to pay for freedom? When I have to say what happened to me, what happened to my friends, what happened to everybody over there was for nothing, and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter pill to swallow. ' MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over In the summer of 1972, the Republican convention was held in Miami. President Nixon was getting ready to accept the nomination for reelection. Bobby Muller went to Florida with other Vietnam veterans to protest the war. BOBBY MULLER : And when the president came and gave his acceptance speech for the nomination to run again, it was the most quiet that the hall would get, took a deep breath, leaned back, and started shouting. BOBBY MULLER : Stop the bombing! VIETNAM VETERAN : Stop the murder! Pres. RICHARD NIXON : Let us build a peace that our children and all the children of the world can enjoy for generations. BOBBY MULLER : I 've got to be honest with you. I considered it one of my more heroic moments, you know. Here I am, surrounded by, you know, 15,000 people, all dressed up, you know, suits, ties, Republicans, rich people in adulation of their president, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wheelchairs, you know, having slept in Flamingo Park for a week, so we stunk, and we 're in camouflage, so we were these real dirtbags, and finally somebody said, ' Throw them out. ' And with that, you know, they threw us out a back door, and that was it. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Angry and bitter, Bobby Muller decided that veterans like him needed their own voice in the corridors of power. In 1978 he went to Washington and put together the first Vietnam veterans ' organization in the country. JOHN TERZANO, President, Vietnam Vets of America Foundation : There 's no doubt in my mind that there would n't have been a Vietnam veteran organization or a Vietnam veterans movement in this country without Bobby. He was the person that put it together. He took out second mortgages on his house to keep money coming into the organization in the early days, and he was the person that had the drive and determination to keep it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was considered out of the mainstream, and they had little support from the American public, and even less money, but Muller 's group did catch the attention of one well-respected public figure. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN : We talked for about an hour and he, you know, at the end I said, ' Well, gee, you know, you know, I can make a lot of noise, and I can make some money, you know, so that 's what I 'm good for, and if there 's any way that I can kind of, you know, help you out. ' BOBBY MULLER : A couple of weeks later we 're in Los Angeles, one night we had a benefit for the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, raised $100,000 in the evening, and saved the Vietnam veterans movement in this country. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Springsteen has supported the organization ever since. A few years later, when he wrote this song, he played it first for Bobby Muller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- basically it was in the voice of the Vietnam veteran. Hey, I did n't go to Vietnam, you know, I stayed home, and I was really concerned, like, with- getting it right, and you know, he wheeled into the room and I put him in front of these two big speakers, you know, and I just hit the tape button, and, you know, kind of watched him as it went by, you know, and said, ' Hey, did I get it, ' you know? ' Did I get it? ' MICHEL McQUEEN : He says, in ' Born in the USA, ' you know, the cool-rocking daddy of the USA, he says that 's about him. Is that true? BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN : Sure is. MICHEL McQUEEN : Really? BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN : That 's a good part of Bobby 's voice, you know, yeah. Sure. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Bobby Muller 's life has now come full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In 1991, he helped organize this clinic in Cambodia to provide artificial limbs and wheelchairs to victims of land mines. CAMBODIAN MAN : This is a borrowed leg. He borrowed from his friend to come here. BOBBY MULLER : He borrowed the leg from his friend. To come here. BOBBY MULLER : That 's really totally useless. This is the one you 've got to watch, all right? Because if we get in a fight- MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over With Muller 's help, the international campaign against the use of land mines is developing real momentum. Sen. PATRICK LEAHY,( D), Vermont : He has been absolutely indispensable in helping me get support for the ban on land mines. I 've gone to him many, many times and said, ' We need a few more votes here. Can you talk to this person, can you talk to that person? ' I 've never had him say no. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Bobby Muller spends part of each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without legs, can be filled with purpose. BOBBY MULLER : But I was able to get strong, and I was able to get back to work. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over Still, he wishes that no one had to learn that lesson, and that everyone could see that such suffering is rarely justified. interviewing Is there any situation that you can envision that you would think was worth fighting for? BOBBY MULLER : Oh, absolutely. I 've killed people, I 've gone to war. I am not a pacifist. I 'm somebody that was burned by the reckless use of American military power, and has come back and examined and challenged when it is that we 're going to commit Americans and military force and lives to battle. MICHEL McQUEEN : voice-over In the ideal world, Bobby Muller 's organization could move beyond issues of war, but he is not optimistic. BOBBY MULLER : When war has been put in the history books and is as archaic an idea as the torture devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when we 'll be out of business. Our bottom line is dealing with war and the issues around war, and war, unfortunately, is a good business to be in. FORREST SAWYER : Bobby Muller 's work today is with the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, a group he founded after parting ways with the Vietnam Veterans of America. Commercial break ANNOUNCER : Still to come on Day One, at the height of his career, Hank Aaron feared for his life. HANK AARON : Well, I had police protection at every site and everyplace I went, so it was- it was really tough living @!ANNOUNCER For Hank Aaron, beating the Babe meant standing up against prejudice, and a moment of glory taken away. HANK AARON : What I accomplished in baseball, I did not enjoy it at all @!ANNOUNCER Hank Aaron remembers, when Day One continues after this from our ABC stations. Commercial break The Hammer FORREST SAWYER : One of the greatest records in sports was broken 20 years ago. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 714 home runs. His name is Babe Ruth. And this is the man who broke it, Hank Aaron. But for Aaron, what should have been the pinnacle of his career was, instead, the lowest point of his life, because while Hank Aaron was chasing the Babe, he was being chased by racist threats, all because he was a black man going after a white man 's record. voice-over Here he is today, baseball 's home run king, 60 years old, passing the second decade of the game 's greatest record, and he will not get much more attention than this. Hank Aaron hardly minds. That record should have been his best moment in baseball. Instead, it was the worst pain in his life. HANK AARON : To this moment, I do n't think about it until somebody brings it up, you know? I do n't think about it because of the- because of some of the scars, I guess, it left in me, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and long, and track all the way back to 1952, when Aaron broke into the old Negro leagues. He played for the Indianapolis Clowns. To fill the stands, the athletes had to bring in a midget named Bebop, and a comedian, King Tut. HANK AARON : That was part of our routine, that we had to put on an act before the game started. But once the game started, you know, we were serious. We wanted to win. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Only a few years earlier, Jackie Robinson had successfully broken baseball 's color barrier when he became a star with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Now the Milwaukee Braves wanted their own black players, so young Henry Aaron became baseball 's next experiment in integration, only his test was in the heart of Dixie, with the Braves ' Jacksonville, Florida farm team. HANK AARON : Everything was segregated. The ballpark itself was segregated, you know, and you had a black section over here, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAWYER : People would shout things at you at the stadium. HANK AARON : Oh, call you all kind of names. Not only the fans. You had players, you know, some of the opposing players would do that, too, you know, would try to upset you by calling you names and doing certain- and having- and just- just trying to belittle you, you know? FORREST SAWYER : How do you keep your cool during that? HANK AARON : When I looked in the stands, you know, after they 'd say these nasty things, I 'd look in the stands and I 'd see all these black people in the stands, and I 'd say, ' I can not let them down. ' FORREST SAWYER : voice-over And he did not let them down. By 1957, Aaron was the National League 's Most Valuable Player, leading his team to a World Series victory over the New York Yankees. Even so, the following spring it was the same old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stay in the same hotel, and in fact, he could n't drink out of the same fountain and go to the same bathroom. All of a sudden, I realized what was going on, and that 's the only regret I have, that I did n't make more of a stand. BOB UECKER : To be around Hank, you know, I thought it was great for me. I was no big-deal ballplayer. FORREST SAWYER : Bob Uecker played with Aaron in Milwaukee, and then again after the Braves moved to Atlanta. He was there to watch his teammate quietly hammer out history, chasing a legend around the base paths. BOB UECKER : Who thought he was going to catch Babe Ruth? I mean, at that time. You know, he gets to 400 home runs, ah, big deal, you know, he 's still got 314 more to go, you know. Then he gets to 500 and you say, ' Wait a minute, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you say, ' Wait a minute, this guy 's got a shot. ' FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Which is when all hell broke loose : 1973, Aaron was 39, and he was suddenly discovered, marching his way to glory, and a lot of people did n't like what they saw. Who was this no-personality stiff trying to put the Babe in the shadows? With 41 homers to go, Hammering Hank Aaron 's old teammate, Eddie Mathews, was now his manager. EDDIE MATHEWS : I did n't want to be a manager, but they talked me into it, and I inherited Hank when the thing popped. I said, ' Hammer, this is going to be a nightmare, ' because you can see this influx of sportswriters, even in spring training. ' HANK AARON : That ' 73 season was a mother, you know, really. I mean, it was tough on me, you know, in more ways than one. I would come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can imagine, every single day was the same thing, you know, talking about the home runs, talking about the home runs. SPORTS REPORTER : Your times at bat compared to Ruth 's, say, and that sort of thing, and people are forever coming up with unpopular concepts. HANK AARON : I don't- I do n't really care what they say. I 've got 3,300, 3,400 hits, too, and Ruth did n't get that, so I do n't care about that. I do n't really care what they say about me. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over To the sportswriters, that sounded uppity, so they started taking a few swings of their own. But as bad as that pressure was for Aaron, as bad as it had been all those years, that was nothing. What made it really ugly were the letters. HANK AARON : reading ' Hank, there 's three things you ca n't give a nigger, a black eye, a puffed lip, or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have covered the pain, but it did n't keep the letters from coming, by the thousands. ' Dear black boy, We do n't want no nigger Babe Ruth. ' ' Dear Mr. Nigger, I hope you do n't break the Babe 's record. How do I tell my kids that a nigger did it. ' ' You 'll be in Montreal June 5-7. Will you die there? ' interviewing Did it hurt to read all this stuff? HANK AARON : Yes, it hurt very much. It hurts right now, when I go back through them and look at some of the letters, yes, it hurts. FORREST SAWYER : Do you read the letters, even today? HANK AARON : They are there. Let me put it that way, Forrest. I have them, no question about it, you know. In regards to whether people say I should throw them away, or what, they are still there. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over The hatred that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot to kidnap his daughter while she was at college. It seemed the nightmare would never end. DARRELL EVANS, Atlanta Braves, 1969-1976 : It was like he was assassinating somebody. It was like he was going to take somebody and throw somebody in jail. It was like he 's going to take Babe Ruth 's name and paint his name- cross it out and paint Hank Aaron 's name on it. Well, that 's crazy, and it 's still crazy now. HANK AARON : I kind of felt like I needed to isolate myself, and I did. I stayed in a different hotel from some of my teammates, I was not able to receive calls. I was kind of like living in a bubble, you know. I had police protection at every site and everyplace I went. So it was really tough living. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Call it magic, call it faith, but somehow Aaron felt safest when he was most exposed, out on the ballfield. Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought they could. DUSTY BAKER, Atlanta Braves, 1968-1975 : We were scared, but we did n't want to show Hank that we were afraid, so we were like, ' Aw, Hank, no problem, man, we 're down with you, you know. ' Hank says, ' Hey, you guys, do n't sit by me tonight, because, you know, somebody 's going to try to assassinate me tonight. ' HANK AARON : And sure enough, somebody threw about 15 firecrackers on the field, just started popping all around, and boy, you should have saw the guys dancing and ducking. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over The dust finally cleared that season when Aaron took his final swing. interviewing You ended the season with? HANK AARON : Seven-thirteen. FORREST SAWYER : Babe Ruth 's record was? HANK AARON : Seven-fourteen. FORREST SAWYER : One short. HANK AARON : Right. One short. FORREST SAWYER : And you 've got to wait. HANK AARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over So Hank Aaron cleared out of town with his brand-new bride, Atlanta TV personality and civil rights activist Billye Williams. The next season, when Aaron spoke out against racism, there was someone new to blame. BILLYE WILLIAMS AARON : ' Well, it has to be that wife of his. She has to be behind it. He 's always been quiet. Where was he before? ' Is what some reporters said. And obviously, many of them had just never paid him any attention until he got right up on the record. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Opening day in Cincinnati, April 4th, 1974. Would this be his last season? HANK AARON : I hope so. I just hope I can get through it. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over Lots of hoopla, celebrities around. Hank Aaron just wanted it over. GAME ANNOUNCER : Three-one pitch. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over His first time at bat. GAME ANNOUNCER : There 's a drive into left field. That ball is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over The record was tied. GAME ANNOUNCER : The crowd is up, as you would expect, a standing ovation. His teammates are there to greet him. A three-run blast by Henry Aaron has tied the great Babe Ruth. FORREST SAWYER : voice-over And just four days later, April 8th, in Atlanta, Henry Aaron was ready to run past Ruth. interviewing Seven-fifteen was hit right here. HANK AARON : That 's right. FORREST SAWYER : If you look out on the field, does it come to mind? HANK AARON : Yes, right there, I remember that. Here it is, right there. FORREST SAWYER : Tell me about it. HANK AARON : Well, it was rather- it was kind of a cool night, you know, here on April 8th, 1974. DARRELL EVANS : That night, I think we knew. The omen was, he 's number 44, Downing is 44, pitching against us, he 's a lefthander, and I know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on base, to be on base for this to happen, and then, when I was on base and I 'm thinking, ' Okay, if I 'm on base, how am I going to be able to shake his hand first? ' HANK AARON : What I did that night, really, was to move up on the plate just a little bit, because, you know, he throws a screwball, thrown by a lefthander, you know, usually it breaks away. GAME ANNOUNCER : And here 's the pitch by Downing. Swinging, there 's a drive into left center field. That ball is gon na be outta here! It 's gone! It 's 715! There 's a new home run champion of all time, and it 's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going! Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate, and listen to this crowd. DARRELL EVANS : There 's no better moment in my baseball career than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on base when Hank Aaron hit 715. No one else can say that, so that's- it gives me chills just to think about it. So I certainly did enjoy it an awful lot. EDDIE MATHEWS : I said, ' You 've been watching the best baseball player I 've ever seen. ' HANK AARON : I felt free, and I felt like it was a load off my back, I felt like it was time for me to just say, ' Hey, it 's over with, done with, and that 's it. ' FORREST SAWYER : ' Leave me alone. ' HANK AARON : Yes. That 's right. FORREST SAWYER : Do you feel like you were robbed of the pleasure that you had earned? HANK AARON : Yes. The moment, the chase, the home runs and et cetera, what I accomplished in baseball, I did not enjoy it at all. FORREST SAWYER : So when you think back to the greatest moment of your husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure that came from achieving this thing? You really think of the racism that was shown. BILLYE WILLIAMS AARON : It 's always there. I do n't like the feeling that comes with it. I do n't like feeling- sad about it. It should have been a very, very special time, and to the degree that we can make it and remember it that way, that 's how I 'd rather remember it, and enjoy what aspects of it we can enjoy. So it 's better not- I mean, for us, it's- it 's something that you just- live with. HANK AARON : And I just thank God it 's all over with. Thank you very much. FORREST SAWYER : Hank Aaron went on to hit another 40 home runs, for a record total of 755. Now, here 's how incredible that record is. A player today could hit 35 homers every year for 20 straight years, and he would still be 55 home runs short of Aaron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be broken @!ANNOUNCER Still to come on Day One, fixing up what fell down in Los Angeles was supposed to take nine months, but just three months later, the job is nearly done. WOMAN, Freeway Construction Worker : I can hardly believe it myself @!ANNOUNCER How did they do it? When Day One continues. Commercial break On the Road Again FORREST SAWYER : You 've heard that old expression, if they can put a man on the moon, they can do just about anything. Well, they 're not trying to get to the moon in southern California, they 're just trying to get to work. Earthquake damage made repairs to the Santa Monica freeway an astronomical task, but less than three months after the quake, this commuter lifeline, ' The 10, ' is about to reopen, way ahead of schedule. Here 's Judy Muller with the story of how they did it. JUDY MULLER, ABC News : voice-over When this man commutes to work from Sacramento, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't worry about the conditions of the freeways until he gets to work. C.C. Meyers is the contractor hired by the state of California to repair the overpasses on the busy Santa Monica freeway that were destroyed in the earthquake. C.C. MEYERS : Just another bridge. JUDY MULLER : Just another bridge? It 's not just another bridge. C.C. MEYERS : It 's another bridge, we just did it faster, that 's all. JUDY MULLER : voice-over Faster is an understatement. C.C. Meyers and his crew wasted no time tackling this job. They were there the night of the earthquake, in fact, shoring up the damaged road. January 18, 1994 REPORTER : What 's the company that has the contract here? 1st FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION WORKER : That 's C.C. Meyers @!REPORTER Okay. Boy, they do n't fool around. JUDY MULLER : voice-over But few thought this would turn into this in just three months time. Back then, not even the savviest of reporters came close. ' This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1994 And transportation officials have n't set a specific date, that would be foolhardy, but I 've heard estimates as optimistic as nine months. C.C. MEYERS : Nine months, I think, probably in a lot of situations, the way things are administered these days, through all the red tape, would probably be a reasonable amount of time to expect it would take to do something like this. I guess what has been proven here is that if they really want to do something and get it done fast, it can be done. JUDY MULLER : voice-over And the state really wanted to do this. The loss of the Santa Monica freeway, or ' The 10, ' as it 's called, has cost the city about a million dollars a day in commuting and shipping costs. The state cut the usual contractual red tape to get this job going. ROY FISHER, CalTrans : You know, this contract came out on the 4th of February, you know, which is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If we 'd have gone through our normal process, this job probably would n't have started till what? Now. JUDY MULLER : voice-over C.C. Meyers started work at 12:01 A.M. on the 5th. He summoned his subcontractors, hired hundreds of laborers, and put them on round-the-clock shifts seven days a week. C.C. MEYERS : Just like going to war, right? You 've got to be ready. JUDY MULLER : voice-over C.C. rented his own trains to bring supplies in from the East Coast, at a cost of $125,000 a load, and some of those materials are expensive and state-of-the-art. on camera Usually, the process of building a road is about as exciting as, well, watching cement dry, but even that cliche does n't hold true on this project. They 're using a special kind of fast-drying cement here. Normal cement would take three days to dry. This cement was poured two hours ago, and I 'm already standing on it. voice-over To oversee the whole operation, Meyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. GARY JANKO : Why do n't you get that other compressor? All right, give me the hammer. Run that straight edge on out. to interviewer Well, the night before I think I left the job around 2:30 A.M., and I was back on the job at 6:30 A.M. It 's really hard to explain. It 's a good feeling. It 's dark out and the sun comes up, and here you 've got this done. 2nd FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION WORKER : I 've done bridges half this size that took close to a year, so this, to me- I mean, I can hardly believe it myself. JUDY MULLER : Is this the kind of thing you 'll tell your grandchildren about, you know, ' I did the Santa Monica freeway? ' 2nd FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION WORKER : Yeah. I think my kids and my mom- my mom 's getting more of a blast out of it than me, you know. ' My daughter 's over there, you know, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDY MULLER : voice-over And making all that money. With time and a half for overtime, some of these workers are bringing home $3,000 to $4,000 a week. interviewing No job will ever be the same after this. 3rd FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION WORKER : No, not really. No. A regular eight-hour thing, it 'll feel like part-time. JUDY MULLER : voice-over C.C. Meyers made a fair amount of money himself. As incentive to get the job done, the state promised him a $200,000-a-day bonus for every day he finished before the June 24th deadline. That adds up to more than $14.5 million, and that 's in addition to his $15-million contract. C.C. MEYERS : I 'm going to get some money, there 's no question about that. But I get the satisfaction of building something to the magnitude of this, in the period of time we did it. JUDY MULLER : But there are people, you say, who are accusing you of being greedy. Does that hurt your feelings? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer that. JUDY MULLER : Go ahead. C.C. MEYERS : I 'd tell them to go to hell, no. JUDY MULLER : voice-over Besides, says Meyers, the state got its money 's worth. This freeway has been built to last. C.C. MEYERS : They do n't have to worry about this one. The biggest earthquake that ever could hit, when Los Angeles is flat on the ground, everything, those two bridges will be standing there. They 're made out of stronger than steel. JUDY MULLER : voice-over But the contractor admits he could not have accomplished this feat without the cooperation of the state, including the engineers who stayed on the site around the clock to inspect the work as it progressed. ROY FISHER : The most amazing part of this whole thing is just, you know, you get a big bureaucratic machine like the government and other agencies, and you can cut out a lot of the red tape and you have everyone focus on just that one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is what can happen. JUDY MULLER : The problem is, you 've done it once. We 're going to expect that you 're going to do it every time now. ROY FISHER : Yeah, I know, success is going to be the end of us all, I think. JUDY MULLER : voice-over But it 's not going to be the end of C.C. Meyers. Fear of success is not something he suffers from. As for his plans for that bonus money, C.C. says he could really use a bigger jet, so he can commute to all those freeways in his future. C.C. MEYERS : A nice way to travel, huh? FORREST SAWYER : You can sleep well tonight, Los Angeles. The Santa Monica freeway will be open for business by rush hour tomorrow morning. Commercial break FORREST SAWYER:We have a program note. This Wednesday, on Turning Point with Diane Sawyer, one of Chicago 's biggest newspapers was tired of crime and did something about it. Find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And later tonight, Nightline. But that 's our broadcast for tonight. I 'm Forrest Sawyer. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.
