234541 KATIE @!COURIC, co-host : The year is 2020, and nuclear war has left much of the United States in ruin. That 's the setting for John Updike 's latest novel, " Toward the End of Time, " the story of a man facing his own mortality as his life nears its end. On that cheery note, good morning, good to see you. @!Mr-JOHN-UPDIKE-@1 " : Good morning, I guess we say. Yes. @!COURIC : I guess. This is your second foray into the future, and I know that you find writing about the future, writing books set in the future very liberating. How come? @!Mr-UPDIKE : You 're sort of free of a lot of details of the real life. I mean you can kind of make up a world, if you have the imagination. My futures tend not to be too much un -- unlike the present. But there is an attempt. Yeah, there 's a leap -- there 's a leap into empty space that 's sort of exciting. @!COURIC : And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this is a little way for you to incorporate that fascination? @!Mr-UPDIKE : I read it as a boy. And I do n't know if science -- how to really write science fiction. But yes, this is my attempt to write a science fiction novel. @!COURIC : So as I mentioned, this novel is set in the year, you know, 2020, post war -- post-nuclear war. @!Mr-UPDIKE : That 's right. @!COURIC : And this country is a mess. Explain sort of the scene and the environment. @!Mr-UPDIKE : The country is a mess. But we do n't have to really go out and visit it. We -- they basically stay with my hero. His name is Ben Turnbull. And he 's a crotchety 66-year-old man in the year 2020 who lives on top of a hill and is retired and has decided to keep a journal. So the journal entries mention that yes, there 's chaos out there and anarchy. And there are various anarchic elements that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have evolved out of machinery parts, out of metal. They 're metallo bioforms that go around nipping at people 's ankles. But... @!COURIC : Now where did you come up with that? @!Mr-UPDIKE : I 've always thought that maybe the process of evolution might occur in a dump -- say -- in a dump, instead of or -- or -- organic matter. You have inorganic matter creating little tiny animals, then bigger animals, then who knows how big they 'll get. @!COURIC : Yeah. And tell me what else is going on in this country? The Midwest is pretty much a mess, but pockets of the Northeast are just going on fairly normally? @!Mr-UPDIKE : Yes. @!COURIC : Fairly. @!Mr-UPDIKE : And mysteriously enough, the trains seem to run, and offices still operate. But -- but Boston is much less -- fewer people than it used to. Yeah, but in a way, my limited experience of apres war things is that we very quickly pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed does go on. So, yes, life and messages is going on. @!COURIC : Let 's talk more about this -- this fellow, Ben, who is your protagonist, and whose diary the story is told through. He 's -- he 's not a very likable sort. He 's a bit of a creep. @!Mr-UPDIKE : Mishiko Kakatani in The New York Times did n't like him, but I kind of liked him. I would n't say he 's a creep, exactly, but he is a man trying to come to terms with his -- his approaching end. His time is ending. And, yes, he 's kind of sardonic and mean. I hope I 'm not that sardonic and mean, but he has a few rough edges, you could say. @!COURIC : Is there a little bit of John Updike in Ben Turnbull? @!Mr-UPDIKE : A little bit, but not all me. With any fictional character, you try to extrapolate from your own inklings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I hope so, because he does have an affair with a 13-year-old girl? @!Mr-UPDIKE : Yes, he does. But it 's certainly a glancing affair. It does n't go on for very long. @!COURIC : So it does n't count? @!Mr-UPDIKE : And there are certain rules they both observe. So, yes. @!COURIC : Tell us about his obsession with the aging process, and if you -- if you share some of his concerns. @!Mr-UPDIKE : You ca n't -- but, you see, you do n't know yet because you have n't begun to age. @!COURIC : I 'm starting to understand, actually. @!Mr-UPDIKE : But when you do age, you tend to observe it and notice it and the details. And it 's sort of -- I would n't say I wake up and look in the mirror horrified, but I certainly am not greatly pleased by what I see, and neither is Ben. So yes, he 's keeping track of the aging process. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on, it 's also the brain. The brain kind of develops gaps in it. So when you reach for a word, it 's not there. You reach for a feeling and it 's not there. So he 's -- my book reflects those -- those holes in his consciousness, as well as... @!COURIC : Right. Looking forward to it. I know that you 're also writing a more light-hearted approach to aging that 's a little less intense. @!Mr-UPDIKE : I thought I 'd try to revive an old writer character of mine called Henry Beck, who -- who has his problems, but they 're not Ben 's problems. @!COURIC : Now before we go, I want to ask you about this Internet project, a murder mystery that you started and finished and other people filled the gaps. Do you find that satisfying? @!Mr-UPDIKE : It was sort of lucky. I did n't really play a very big part in it. People think I was judging and helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the beginning. The beginning, which is a murder mystery I 'd never be able to complete. I was happy to let them have that page. And then other people contributed paragraph by paragraph, this rather tangled tale. Then it was my task -- my happy task at the end to sort of wind it up, which I did do. @!COURIC : Were you heartened to see that people in this country could write? @!Mr-UPDIKE : Yes. They were very... @!COURIC : And had imagination and creativity? @!Mr-UPDIKE :... very literate, and they cited classics and they were bookish, almost. Yes, it was surprising. @!COURIC : See, everybody thinks the masses... @!Mr-UPDIKE : No, they 're reading all the time, it turns out. The masses are crazy about the written word. @!COURIC : Well, John Updike, everyone is crazy about your written word. So the newest novel is called " Toward the End of Time. " It 's a real pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thanks so much for coming in. @!Mr-UPDIKE : You 're most kind. Thank you. @!COURIC : Up next, some things you men can chuckle about, hopefully, as you hit 50, speaking of aging. But first, this is TODAY on NBC.
