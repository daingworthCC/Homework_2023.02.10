4026341 JOE WITTE, announcer : TODAY THROWS A WEDDING : RACE FOR THE ALTAR is brought to you by... @!MATT-LAUER-co-hos : And what do you say we throw a wedding? @!MEREDITH-VIEIRA-c : Why not? Let 's do it. @!LAUER : OK. Our RACE TO THE ALTAR is over. It 's time for LaDonna and Darnell to tie the knot in an East meets West themed wedding. And we 're going to do it right now. First we want to tell you that the wedding will be presided over by this gentleman right here. He is Pastor Willie Butler. And he is from -- actually, he used to be LaDonna 's pastor, and he is with the Project Dreams Ministries. And he met LaDonna when she was only eight years old. He used to be in Sugarland, Texas. @!VIEIRA : And here he is now, the groom, Darnell Suggs. LaDonna and Darnell have been together for over three years. He looks pretty cool and collected. Decided to surprise LaDonna with a special vacation to Egypt. All LaDonna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day. While standing by the Sphinx, Darnell popped the question and LaDonna, as you know, said yes. @!LAUER : Let 's talk about the proud parents now, shall we? This is Steve and Jacqueline Suggs. They are the parents of the groom. They have been married for 27 years, and their children still cringe, but they call each other, romantically, " Butter. " They just get along wonderfully. And Jacqueline, by the way, told Darnell that LaDonna was the one for him very early on after they met. @!VIEIRA : And then Donna Bradford, LaDonna 's mother. We have fallen in love with her. She is from historic Tuskegee, Alabama. She met LaDonna 's father, Wade, who was a police officer and World War II vet on her first day at work in an area hospital. Wade and Donna fell in love and they were soul mates. LaDonna 's dad, Wade, however, passed away in May of 1993. LaDonna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!LAUER : We have got a wonderful bridal party and we 're starting now with Christian Davis and Dana Suggs. Christian and Darnell are simply best friends since they met in high school. And Dana is Darnell 's baby sister. She 's 15 years old, in the 10th grade and she is one of Darnell 's favorite people in the whole world. @!VIEIRA : And up next, Leigh Torrence and Jessica Okake. You might actually recognize Leigh. He 's currently cornerback of the Washington Redskins in the NFL. Leigh and Darnell have known each other for over 22 years. And, ladies, he is single. Growing up, Leigh and Darnell were constantly together playing sports. Leigh was there when Darnell almost broke his neck, and Leigh was also there when Darnell did break his wrist. And Jessica, one of LaDonna 's closest friends. LaDonna used to call her Jessie Bobohead, when they were in kindergarten. @!LAUER : By the way, the bridal party all wearing the outfits you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks. Here 's Matthew McFarland and Lauren Barnes. Matthew is a grad student at Florida State University. When they were in college, Matthew and Darnell would order pizza every night and watch " Forrest Gump " over and over again. Lauren Barnes and LaDonna met a few years back in college. LaDonna says that Lauren is the one who will feed your ego when you need it. And of course we all need that from time to time. @!VIEIRA : We absolutely do. And now the best man and the maid of honor, Damon Suggs and Gwedette Bradford. Damon, Darnell 's younger brother, currently a senior at Georgia Southern University. When the Suggs were growing up, everyone would stay away from Damon whenever he was eating because he was a messy eater, would get his mess all over everyone else, especially barbecue. And Gwedette Bradford, LaDonna 's big sister, the apple of her eye. The two are 18 months apart and as close as sisters can be. Gwedette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now, at last, as the music changes to " At Last, " here comes the bride. LaDonna Bradford in her Priscilla of Boston gown. She 's being escorted by her grandfather Jackson C. Summers or, as family and friends call him, " J.C. " LaDonna 's father, as we mentioned, passed away when she was eight years old. Her grandfather has been an instrumental part of her life. And do n't tell the other grandkids, but I think LaDonna is J.C. ' s favorite. LaDonna 's 24 years old, a nuclear reactor inspector for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and she knew Darnell was the one when he started driving 300 miles just to sit in on her college design classes whenever she had a presentation. How beautiful does she look? @!VIEIRA : She is absolutely stunning. The perfect gown for her. Our audience was right. She looks beautiful. @!LAUER : And ladies and gentlemen, it 's time now for the wedding of LaDonna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Ms-LaDONNA-BRADFOR :( Holding out bouquet) Gwedette. Pastor WILLIE BUTLER : Dearly beloved, we have come together today in the presence of God to witness the joining of this man, Darnell Suggs, to this woman, LaDonna Bradford, in holy matrimony. I 've known LaDonna since she was eight years old. I baptized her and I conducted her father 's funeral. I 've watched her grow up into a -- to be a beautiful and smart and elegant young lady. And as for Darnell, he is so respectful. I almost see a mirror image between the two of them. Now, marriage is one of the highest and happiest of all the human relationships. And I am so very happy to be able to share this special day with two such deserving couple. Darnell and LaDonna, if you have both considered the commitment that you 're about to enter, please join your hands. And as for your vows, you both have chosen to speak directly from your heart. Darnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to offer my heart, my soul and to pledge my love to you for a lifetime. As God is our witness, I pray that we will continue to grow in his will, that we will live according to his will and that we will always try to love each other as much as he loves us. LaDonna, you 're my best friend, my confidant and the love of my life. I would go to the ends of the earth just to see you smile, to see you laugh, to kiss you softly, to hold you tenderly and to be at your side to ease your fears. I stand here a better man because of you. For as long as I live, I promise to love you for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to guide and to protect you, to honor and respect you, and to always be faithful to you. I love you. Pastor BUTLER : LaDonna : @!Ms-BRADFORD : Darnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather just gave me to you in marriage. As we enter upon life 's privileges and joys, I will look to you to be the head of our home as we look to Christ to be the head of the church. I love you with all of my heart. You are my very best friend, and we have known each other for this time and I love you dearly. I promise you fidelity. I promise you loyalty. I promise to be there for you through thick and thin, when life is good, when it 's bad, when our relationship is at its best and at -- when it is an effort. I promise to be there for you. I promise to comfort you. I promise to laugh with you and love you in all that we do. I will love you with every beat of my heart from now for as long as we both shall live. And this is my solemn vow to you. Pastor BUTLER : Darnell, do you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawfully wedded wife, before these witnesses, forsaking all others till death do you part? @!Mr-SUGGS : I do. Pastor BUTLER : LaDonna, do you take this man whose hand you now hold to be your lawfully wedded husband, before these witnesses, forsaking all others till death do you part? @!Ms-BRADFORD : I do. Pastor BUTLER : Wedding rings are circular for a reason. They represent an unending love and commitment, which you are making to one another today. May these rings be the seal of a pure and imperishable faith that you have now pledged to each other. Darnell, would you please repeat after me, please? This ring is a sign of my constant faith and abiding love. @!Mr-SUGGS : This ring is a sign of my constant faith and abiding love. Pastor BUTLER : LaDonna, would you please repeat after me, please? This ring is a sign of my constant faith and abiding love. @!Ms-BRADFORD : This ring is a sign of my constant faith and abiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rings have -- that have no end be a symbol of a lifetime of love and of peace. Now, by virtue of the authority vested in me as a minister of the gospel of Christ and in accordance with the sovereign laws of the sovereign state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Darnell Suggs. @!LAUER : Well, there they are, the newly joined Mr. and Mrs. Darnell Suggs. They jumped a broom, which is part of the African-American tradition, symbolizing the blessed union of marriage. @!VIEIRA : And because it 's our show, we get to talk to them first. @!Mr-SUGGS : Oh. @!VIEIRA : Oh. @!LAUER : Congratulations. @!Mr-SUGGS : Thank you so much. @!LAUER : It was fantastic. @!VIEIRA : Congratulations. @!LAUER : Congratulations. @!Mr-SUGGS : Thank you so much. @!LAUER : You look so beautiful. @!VIEIRA : Such beautiful, beautiful vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't.

I mean, do you regret anything about turning over all the planning of your wedding to our viewers? @!Ms-SUGGS : Oh, not at all, not at all. I can barely deal with what we had to deal with. I can only imagine having to do what you guys did for us. We appreciate it so much. @!VIEIRA : And we love what both of you said to each other. You were talking about how you 're a better man for having her in her life every day. @!Mr-SUGGS : I am.

You are two charming, lovely young people who deserve just happiness in your life. @!Mr-SUGGS : Thank you. @!Ms-SUGGS : Thank you. @!LAUER : We have a couple things to do. First of all, we 'd like to offer a toast to you two. @!VIEIRA : Yes, we would. @!LAUER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one piece of unfinished business. @!Ms-SUGGS : There is? @!VIEIRA : Honeymoon. @!Mr-SUGGS : Oh, there it is. @!LAUER : And I 'm betting it 's the thing you were looking forward to most. @!Ms-SUGGS : Yes. Yes. @!LAUER : We 're going to find out where you 're going to be going on a honeymoon. @!Ms-SUGGS : Whoo! @!Mr-SUGGS : That 's right. @!VIEIRA : We know you 're going somewhere. @!Ms-SUGGS : That 's right. @!VIEIRA : We 'll find out where. @!LAUER : Well, Mr. and Mrs. Suggs, congratulations again. @!VIEIRA : Congratulations. @!LAUER : We 'll see you in just a second. @!Ms-SUGGS : Thank you so much. @!LAUER : We 're back in a moment. This is TODAY on NBC. *** @!VIEIRA : And we are back with the newly united LaDonna and Darnell Suggs. And in the break Darnell said, We are married, and then LaDonna said, We are so married. And Ann pointed out you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Ms-SUGGS : That 's true. That 's true. @!VIEIRA : Congratulations. @!ANN-CURRY-anchor : Yeah. @!Mr-SUGGS : Thank you. @!VIEIRA : But we wanted to honor you with a toast, so I can give you each -- here 's for LaDonna. @!LAUER : There you go, Al and Ann. @!CURRY : Thanks. @!VIEIRA : And Darnell. We 've all been married a little while and we have a little bit of advice to impart, but mostly just a toast to tell you how much we care about you. @!LAUER : You two won our RACE TO THE ALTAR, and so that was the past and now the future begins. Your lives together begin. Darnell, you 're a computer engineer. You know that in life there is no backspace key, right, OK? Everything moves forward. You also know, to use computer lingo, that when you first laid eyes on LaDonna your heart did a double click, did n't it? @!Mr-SUGGS : That 's right. @!VIEIRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose, you opted for some old-fashioned romance. New Year 's Day, your birthday actually, the Egyptian pyramids, and when Darnell got down on one knee and asked you to be his bride, you actually were as silent as a sphinx for a moment and then you said yes. And on that day you were surrounded by a lot of strangers in Egypt and today you are embraced by your friends and your family and your extended family here at TODAY. @!LAUER : And, LaDonna, you 're a nuclear reactor inspector, OK. So you know what happens, you know the power when an atom is split apart. @!Ms-SUGGS : That 's right. @!LAUER : And now you 're experiencing the power of what can happen when two people come together. And so for our couple from Georgia who met in Boston, pledged their love in Egypt and have now shown their commitment in New York... @!VIEIRA : We hope this toast sets you off in the right direction. @!CURRY : Hm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Suggs. @!LAUER : Cheers. @!VIEIRA : Cheers. @!LAUER : Congratulations. @!VIEIRA : Congratulations. @!CURRY : Congratulations. @!VIEIRA : Mm. @!Ms-SUGGS : Very nice. @!VIEIRA : Now you want to go do it again?
