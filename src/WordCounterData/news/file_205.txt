3040241 <p> When was the last time you spotted chicken-liver curry on a local Indian menu? <p> Right, it 's far from being a staple on the mulligatawny-chapati circuit. When I encounter an item such as that, I shake out my napkin and get ready to dig in deeply. <p> Neat, clean Asian restaurants with good food, polite help, convenient location and plenty of free parking are pearls almost beyond price. <p> If the kitchen boasts an interesting edge or two, so much the better. <p> The curry in question - served at Jewel of India - is mildly spicy, delicious and not at all livery, at least not in the nose-wrinkling sense. It does deliver the slightly earthy, truffle-like qualities treasured by members of Liver Lovers Anonymous. And it does not stand alone. The menu offers other liverly bounty : sauteed and herbed as an appetizer and stuffed into bread as a side dish. <p> If the very thought of liver makes you go all giggledy-poo, keep reading. Jewel of India, a couple of doors from Sierra Grill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more to offer. <p> The place is spotless, new and attractive. Picture a long, narrow, nearly empty room ; pale green walls with small, romantic pictures hanging up high ; red and green tablecloths ; and Indian music clinking right along. On a hot night, the restaurant seems almost a passage through which one might bridge the continents. America! India! Peace! <p> Well. Returning to such mundane matters as dinner, the cuisine is rather less exquisitely evocative of things subcontinental. Well- prepared? Tasty? An extensive, balanced menu? Yes. <p> Yet the spicing is in almost every instance toned down, as if painfully adapted to some imaginary, fearful Midtown milquetoast tongue. Where hotness is expected, warmth comes ; where fireflowers of flavor, mere seasoning. <p> The fearful should thus stand reassured. People Who Shudder, you wo n't be frightened here. Not unless you inadvertently order liver. <p> That said, several main dishes are worth anybody 's time. Kati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham, is tossed with shaag bhajee - spiced spinach, tomatoes and onions. The quite-good latter, which has bite, is available separately and is a component of lamb shaag and other dishes as well. <p> Shrimp pathia, about eight tasty shrimp in a thick lentil sauce, makes a good foil for the kati chicken.( At $ 12.25, it 's also on the expensive side.) Mottor ponir - fried Indian cheese( which looks deliciously like fatback) cooked with green peas and flavored with fresh cilantro - and alu mottor gobi - potatoes, peas and cauliflower cooked in spices - are among the best vegetable dishes, both excellent. <p> To this spread, I would add an order of flavorful nan bread, perhaps a cup of mango chutney and either a glass of mango lassi - a fresh- tasting, refreshing mango-yogurt drink - or an oversize bottle of Tajmahal lager beer from India. <p> For those who require soup, the coconut makes a decent palate cleanser, provided that you enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four visits was better than dull-normal. <p> Of the desserts, kheer - rice custard - toned down from the usual perfumed headiness, is perhaps the best. Of meats, you may want to avoid the thing called lamb, which is virtually devoid of characteristic texture and flavor. <p> To end where we began - with price - it should be said that Jewel of India 's are not rock bottom. Though lunch or dinner will break few budgets, tabs do seem high for the quality of the food and the size of the portions. <p> On the other hand, when a place has what you crave - like curried livers - there just ai n't no price too high to pay. ; The mail bag <p> Dear Mr. Mackle : <p> What Atlanta restaurant most closely resembles Elizabeth on 37th in Savannah in food, ambience and service? My wife just about refuses to eat anyplace else and I 'm going to wear my car out. <p> A.W. Gray, Decatur <p> Dear Mr. Gray : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a progressive dinner on Piedmont Road. Chef Gerry Klaskala 's food at Buckhead Diner( 262-3336) is of the same quality, inventiveness and Southern rightness as Elizabeth Terry 's. The welcoming atmosphere at Chefs ' Cafe( 872-2284) is as refined as the package Elizabeth and Michael Terry have put together. The California cuisine there is wonderful, too. Ask for managing partner Michael Tuohy. <p> Dear Mr. Mackle : <p> I recently ate in the no-smoking section of the St. Charles Deli at Loehmann 's Plaza. We asked the waiter to speak to the customer right behind us about the smoke from his cigarette, but the waiter replied, " No, I would n't want to offend him. " I 'm not sure why he thought his response would n't offend me. <p> Frank Sandler, Atlanta <p> Dear Mr. Sandler : <p> Thanks for the reality check on St. Charles Deli. The heavy attitude there never charmed me, either. Here 's a couple more. <p> Last month, after ordering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited an hour to see food. Just as deliverance seemed at hand, a couple plopped down next to us - he with pipe, she with cigs - and lit up. We moved our tea and beer outside. The server gave us a shamefaced smile and agreed that it was really a shame about such people. But did anyone ask the smokepots to stop? They may be puffing there yet. <p> But hey, try Dusty 's Southern Style. A printed sign at the desk warns customers that they do not provide a no-smoking section. Some servers conspicuously suck sick-making ciggies back at the service bay by the kitchen door.( " Like some ashes on your sandwich, honey? ") The place feels like a lunchroom in Winston-Salem, N.C. <p> Maybe we ought to invest in water pistols.
