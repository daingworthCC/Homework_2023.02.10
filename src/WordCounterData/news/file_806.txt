5019041 <h> The 2017 Quote of the Year was a real tough choice between John Dorsey and Kyrie Irving <p> CLEVELAND, Ohio -- John Dorsey made an immediate impression when he took over the Browns front office from Sashi Brown. <p> And it was n't only that his first move was to release overpaid, underwhelming wide receiver Kenny Britt. <p> Dorsey also said something that got everyone 's attention. For that reason, we ca n't discuss the 2017 Quote of the Year in Cleveland sports without highlighting his take that the previous front office did n't acquire enough " real " football players. <p> Dorsey will obviously get his chance to do that since the Browns have a treasure trove of high picks in 2018, including No. 1 and No. 4 overall. <p> Thank you, Sashi. <p> In the meantime, Dorsey was up against some tough competition for Quote of the Year status.( We did n't even include Kenny Britt 's agent ripping Hue Jackson.) <p> Dorsey had to beat out Kyrie Irving 's Flat Earth Theory, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben, and stay out of casinos) and Hue Jackson coming and going in his support of DeShone Kizer. <p> He also had to go up against an old-standby from Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and a training camp statement from Brock Osweiler( in answer to that nag, Doug Lesmerises.) <p> Maybe someday the Quote of the Year will be dismissive of a hated rival after Cleveland celebrates another championship( " Steelers Schmeelers. ") <p> But until then, we have to pick from a grab bag of quotes that seem to be part famous-last-words and part **29;784;TOOLONG. <p> Join us as we announce the winner in the Quote of the Year competition for 2017.
