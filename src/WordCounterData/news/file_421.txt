3071141 <p> " Push " technology has brought noise levels down a notch in the hectic trading room at Wheat First Butcher Singer Inc. brokerage. <p> Instead of blurting news of a transaction into a speakerphone system, as they did for years, traders in the Richmond, Va., headquarters now quietly feed their block trades into a database. Seconds later, push software silently beams the price and number of shares available to the desktops of more than 1,000 financial consultants in 128 branch offices. <p> Quieter trading rooms are the least of it. Wheat First 's push technology system delivers benefits that could boost the bottom line by several millions dollars a year : Branch-office financial consultants are no longer chained to their speakerphones, yet news of the latest trades is always at their fingertips. In the end, the fresher information lets them offer customers better deals. <p> Throughout corporate America, companies are making push technology part of their future - and it 's changing the way they do business. <p> The nascent technology, sometimes called " Webcasting, " spoon-feeds workers and business partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate networks. Push comes in different flavors, and serves various functions : It is being used to improve customer service, keep sales forces ahead of the competition, update employees, deliver software revisions and keep tabs on manufacturing gear. And push is popping up in companies as diverse as Vermont ice cream maker Ben &; Jerry 's, disk-drive giant Seagate Technology Inc. of Scotts Valley and Alain Pinel Realtors in Saratoga. A new paradigm? Less than a year ago, when push first hit the consciousness of the Internet masses, it was hailed as something different - a consumer 's tool. Pundits proclaimed it a new paradigm in information delivery that would turn the Internet on its head ; it was said the global network would transform into a super-television with the browser replaced by a channel tuner. Push would end information overload, craftily delivering juicy bits of up-to-the-minute news, stock quotes or entertainment programming to desktops. <p> Now that push technology has landed on the desks of millions of computer users as a standard feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Microsoft Corp., it 's clear it wo n't become the consumer-oriented bonanza experts had predicted. <p> Instead, push is slowly becoming a more ubiquitous and, at least for the dozen or so start-ups that have bet their fortunes on it, perhaps a more profitable tool in the business arena. <p> " Push comes to the corporation, " proclaims Bob Schoettle, vice president of marketing for Mountain View, Calif. -based Wayfarer Communications Corp., the company behind the push system at Wheat First Butcher and Singer. " I think this is going to be the story of 1998. " <p> Ira Machefsky, an analyst with the Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif., says corporate push is coming of age. <p> " I 'm starting to get inquiries from Fortune 1000 companies who are trying to find( a place for) push, " Machefsky says. " There is a lot of uncertainty simply because the category is not commonly understood. " <p> Yet the future remains uncertain for many push start-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative at best. Some companies have already perished. Others have been acquired. What 's more, the entrance of Netscape and Microsoft into the push market is likely to alter the landscape in ways that are difficult to predict. <p> In broad terms, push is a way to automatically deliver information across the Internet or a company 's internal network, known as an " intranet. " It follows what the industry calls a " publish-subscribe " model : Users who subscribe to a channel receive new information as soon as it is published. <p> The term " push " was coined to contrast with the more familiar " pull, " which is essentially what computer users do when, with a click of the mouse, they retrieve a Web page off the Internet. <p> Yet push will not replace pull, as some experts predicted. It will complement it - the two delivery mechanisms are best suited to different tasks. <p> " We think an effective business system will need a balanced combination of push and pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at business software giant PeopleSoft Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif. <p> Technically, push technology ranges from the simple to the sophisticated. Internet browsers, for instance, merely simulate push. What they actually do is pull information from Web sites at regular intervals. A subscriber to a browser sports channel, for instance, can see sports scores updated automatically, giving the illusion that the information is being broadcast to the desktop. Yet behind the scenes, the browser is polling the sports channel 's Web site, and pulling new information when it becomes available. <p> More elaborate systems, such as technology from Palo Alto, Calif. -based Tibco Inc., deliver " true " push : As an event happens - a stock trade is completed, inventory falls below a certain level, a competitor advertises a new price on a product - the information is automatically broadcast across the network. Pushed into limelight It is Sunnyvale, Calif. -basedPointCast Inc. that can be credited with virtually singlehandedly pushing push into the limelight. The company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites, stock quotes and weather reports to desktops in the form of a screen saver - was an instant hit when launched in 1996. Within months, more than 1 million users had downloaded the software. <p> But PointCast was a victim of its own popularity. As more employees subscribed to the free, advertising-supported service, traffic grew on corporate networks to the point that many companies discouraged or even banned the use of PointCast. The company also faced increased competition, particularly from the basic push capabilities that are now a commodity in the Internet browsers. <p> To survive, PointCast and other push companies have turned their technologies into more than a Web-page delivery mechanism. Now companies can push virtually any type of digital information : a Web page, a text file, a report from a corporate database or a spreadsheet, the status of a piece of equipment or software. In what is an increasingly tangled push market, each vendor provides a slightly different solution, hoping to meet a specific need in corporate America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneered software distribution using push. Its Castanet tuner lets companies keep far-flung computers up to date, automatically delivering software upgrades to every desktop. Castanet is already being used by many companies, and is included with Netscape 's Navigator browser. <p> In the future, Castanet could do more. Cellular phone maker Ericsson, for instance, is evaluating Castanet as a mechanism to deliver customized features into smart phones. Customers would buy a bare-bones phone and use a built-in Castanet tuner to download different features - speed dialing, e-mail capabilities or even a corporate telephone directory - offered by a service provider. <p> BackWeb Technologies Inc., a San Jose company that got its feet wet creating channels from consumer-oriented Web content, has followed Marimba 's footsteps and entered the software-distribution business. Late last year, the company signed a deal with McAfee Associates, the Santa Clara company known for anti-virus software. <p> With about 300 new viruses cropping up each month, the effectiveness of anti-virus software hinges on its ability to remain up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAfee. The integration with BackWeb has helped McAfee secure several large customers, including a deal with the Department of Defense to keep its estimated 2 million computers virus-free. " For the customer it eliminates having to figure out when new versions are available, " Hodges says.
