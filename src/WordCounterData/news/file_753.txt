However, experts say if you try to purchase a pet online, there 's a good chance you 'll get scammed. A new report by the Better Business Bureau( BBB) says that online pet sale scams are on the rise. Keep in mind, there are some legitimate breeders, but a majority of the websites appear to be scams. In fact, the BBB warns that when you search online, 80 percent of sponsored links may be fraudulent. <p> We have told you about this scheme in the past. One Colorado Springs woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked on a website and emailed the so-called breeder. She said they answered all of her questions so she sent them $500 through a MoneyGram. She went to the airport to pick up her new dog, but the pup was never delivered. <p> " Went to the airport actually and sat there with a blanket, " the woman told me. The next day they asked her for more money. " I stopped communicating altogether. I knew at that point I had been taken big time. " <h> Voice of the Consumer : <p> The BBB International Investigations Initiative reports that " the scams are so widespread that anyone searching for a pet online is likely to encounter this fraud. " The Federal Trade Commission( FTC) has received 37,000 complaints involving pets, many of them are from puppy sale scams. The study found that most victims of the scam lose between $100 and $1,000. <p> " Pet ownership is extremely popular, and pets are often considered a new member of the family, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the BBB of Southern Colorado, in a news release. " We want to inform our community of the growing number of pet scams seen across the U.S. and internationally. " <p> The report says most of the scams seem to originate from the West African country of Cameroon. It says workers in the United States pick up the wire payments. Nearly all of the pictures and information on the sites are copied from legitimate breeder websites. The crooks normally communicate through email, text message or by phone. They wo n't meet in person. The thieves continue to ask for more money until the buyer eventually refuses to keep paying them. <p> There are many ways to avoid falling for the scam. The BBB says you should n't buy a pet without seeing it in person and visiting the breeder. Do n't pay a stranger with a money order. Instead, use a credit card in case you need to dispute the charges. Make sure to check references for the breeder. <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file a report with the BBB or call the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP.
