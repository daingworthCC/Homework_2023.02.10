4136041 ARNOLD The phrase - #calledoutdianne - spread through Twitter accounts in the Fox School District after the revelation last week that derisive online comments about critics of the district came from Superintendent Dianne Critchlow 's house. It was a play on #callitoffdianne, a slogan Fox students used this winter in hopes of convincing her to call a snow day. One person tweeted this week : " we really know how to pick ' em do n't we? disgusting. " Now, Critchlow 's Twitter account is gone, and she may not return to the district either. It 's the latest controversy in a district that has been plagued in recent years by turmoil stemming from allegations of nepotism and attempting to silence dissent, as well as criticism of Critchlow 's $260,598 salary. Critchlow was one of four administrators put on paid leave by the Fox School Board on Wednesday as it investigates libel allegations based on comments on a Topix website about nepotism in the district. The School Board made the moves at a closed meeting in which it appointed Tim Crutchley, the district 's assistant superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave are Critchlow ; her husband, Jamie Critchlow, who heads an at-risk program ; Dan Baker, assistant superintendent of elementary education ; and his wife, Angela Burns Baker, an assistant principal and head of the district 's federal programs. Efforts to reach them have been unsuccessful. Dianne Critchlow had been on leave through the Family and Medical Leave Act. On Thursday, the Critchlows referred all questions to their attorney Chet Pleban, who said, " People in glass houses should n't be throwing stones. " He declined to elaborate. District officials were saying little about the investigation. " The board and all of us in the administration are working very hard to move forward and do what we 're here for, which is to educate kids, " Crutchley said. " And that 's what we would love to be concentrating on doing, and it is what we will be concentrating on. " He would not comment on a report that Dianne Critchlow had told the district she will retire in October. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will be 49. Katie Woodruff, a 2009 Fox graduate, said that the negative attention was hurting the district 's reputation and that new leadership was needed. " There has been so much scandal lately, " Woodruff said. She is one of many who want to know what happened and who did what. " I just want to see the truth come out, " said Daniel Bub, another Fox graduate who is a district bus driver. FIGHT OVER NEPOTISM Residents have criticized the Fox School District for years. In 2012 the School Board came under fire for hiring Kelly Nash, who was an assistant manager at a McDonald 's restaurant and the daughter-in-law of then-board president Linda Nash, as food services director for $65,000 a year, even though she had only a high school diploma and lacked the certifications and education required by other districts. The district has since tightened its anti-nepotism policies. Attempts to stymie district critics brought more unwanted attention. Last year, attorneys for the district sent letters to critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to tone down their behavior or face legal action. The trio said they were being unfairly targeted by an administration seeking to silence them. Ferry, Tyler and Simpson were accused of " harassing, troublesome and confrontational communications, " according to the letters sent by Ernest Trakas of the law firm Mickes Goldman O'Toole. The letters were sent to stop further trouble, Dianne Critchlow said at the time. " You do n't have the right to make up lies and defame someone 's character, " she told the Post-Dispatch. The dispute spilled over onto the Topix website in a forum discussing nepotism allegations in Fox. Some posts on the website accused Ferry, Simpson and Tyler of depravity and criminal acts, including sex with animals and possession of child pornography, according to a libel suit they filed. The suit was against John Doe, because the online comments were anonymous. The lawyer representing the three district critics won a court order to trace the source of the comments and said last week that they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also were traced to the home of William Brengle, who retired as an assistant principal at Fox High School in 2009 after more than 30 years in the district. He has denied saying anything wrong. Simpson has decried Dianne Critchlow 's salary on his blog, Fox C-6 Watchdogs, where he has advocated for the district to be more transparent about its finances. Her base pay for the 2013-2014 school year was the third-highest in the state behind the superintendents of Lee 's Summit and Kirkwood schools, according to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. " A salary that high does n't give me the impression that Fox is trying put all of its dollars into the classroom, " Simpson wrote in a September 2013 blog post. Richard Simpson Elementary School is named for his father, who was a Fox teacher, principal, assistant superintendent and interim superintendent. The Fox district has about 12,000 students. It is similar in size to the Mehlville and Wentzville districts, where superintendents earned $190,592 and $170,000, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary is $124,079, according to the Fox district. Dan Baker makes $156,142, and his wife earns $107,289. Dan Herman, the attorney representing the district critics, filed their suit against John Doe in February before he knew who made the comments, which were posted last year. A judge ordered Topix to turn over the IP address information that led to the administrators ' homes. Herman has said that he expects to amend the lawsuit to include the names of those traced through IP addresses. He would not say whether he intended to add the district as a defendant. Dianne Critchlow was on leave through the Family and Medical Leave for 10.5 days in March and April, according to district documents, and went on leave again May 28, two days before Herman told the Post-Dispatch that the Topix comments had been linked to her home. Her salary for the 2014-2015 year was set at $267,468 and jumps to $274,338 for the 2015-2016 year, according to a contract approved in January. 2000 CONTROVERSY The last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was in 2000, when the School Board tried to fire Diana Bourisaw after accusing her of offenses including favoritism, intimidation and not listening to her assistants. She came to the district in 1996 in a time of upheaval in the district that included missing money and accusations of sexual harassment. She fought her dismissal and filed federal complaints alleging gender and religious discrimination. She also said her role in uncovering an improper business transaction between a board member and the district had contributed to her firing. Ultimately, the district paid Bourisaw a $373,080 settlement and she resigned. She was also represented by Pleban. She went on to serve as superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools from 2006 to 2008.
