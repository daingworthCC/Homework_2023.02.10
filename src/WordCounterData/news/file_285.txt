3049741 <p> Digital music became one of this year 's biggest Internet success stories after several firms started selling Walkman-like devices that let people listen to digital tunes without sitting at a PC. <p> So it came as quite a shock this summer when a tiny Cupertino firm called Audiohighway.com said it had a patent on portable digital music players -- and promptly informed all the companies making such devices that they 'd either have to pay it royalties or quit peddling their wares. <p> " That would be like Ford saying that since he created the first car, nobody else can build cars, " Ron Moore, general counsel for Milpitas ' Diamond Multimedia, one of the device-makers, said in July. <p> Actually, a patent can do just that. Patents confer a 20-year, government-sanctioned monopoly over a given technology. Patent holders can stop anyone else from using an invention, or grant licenses in return for royalty fees. <p> The Audiohighway flap is just one example of the brawls that are erupting in every technical field -- software, hardware, e-commerce and biotechnology -- as firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive rights to new technologies. Questionable patents can stall the pace of innovation and competition in an industry. <p> Patent disputes are n't new. But critics say the lightning pace of innovation, the increasing complexity of inventions and the financial stakes of patent ownership make it tougher for the patent office to perform its traditional role -- deciding who invented what first. <p> Seth Shulman, author of " Owning the Future, " a book about the patent process running amok, argues that the Patent Office is granting so many questionable patents that it may be impeding progress instead of promoting it. <p> " Patents are being misused to gain ownership claims over broad conceptual terrain that used to be freely shared, " Shulman said. <p> His favorite example is the eye doctor who patented a type of cataract incision and tried to stop other surgeons from using it. " What 's next, " he asked rhetorically, " a patent on the Heimlich maneuver? " <p> The loudest complaints of so-called patent abuse have involved Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of letting people name the price they wanted to pay for goods and services. <p> Critics said it never should have gotten such a patent, but the bigger surprise was that Washington, D.C., attorney Thomas Woolston said he got a patent on the same idea -- 17 months earlier. <p> Companies that get controversial patents are understandably defensive. " Some people see us as Johnny-come-latelys ' but they 're wrong, " said Audiohighway co-founder Grant Jasmin. It was 1994 when his company created the Listen-Up Player, a device to download digital music over phone or cable lines and play it back. Audiohighway applied for a patent in 1995. It was issued in June. <p> Audiohighway never sold many of its Listen-Up Players, which used proprietary software to digitize music, and ceased selling the device in 1998. That, ironically, is roughly when the new crop of portable digital players began to appear -- using the free, MP3 software for digitizing sound and using the Web as the download path. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts to decide whether Audiohighway 's patent is enforceable. Meanwhile, similar disputes seem in the offing. Last month, for instance, DoubleClick of New York revealed that it had a patent on delivering ads over the Internet, which could affect every one of its rivals. <p> At the center of the controversy is Todd Dickinson, whose role as acting commissioner of patents and trademarks makes him the middleman in a perpetual tug of war. Patent filers like Audiohighway urge him to expedite certifying that their " inventions " are novel, useful and nonobvious -- prerequisites for obtaining a patent. But every time his office makes a controversial call, critics charge that it is just rubber-stamping outrageous claims. <p> " Are we perfect? No. Are we doing a great job at keeping up with a tremendous increase in the number and complexity of patent applications? Absolutely, " Dickinson said. <p> Between 1997 and 1998 alone, applications soared 13 percent, as 243,062 wannabe inventors asked the patent office to certify their claims. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire 1,300 new patent examiners to augment the 2,000 already on staff. <p> Filling these posts ai n't cheap or easy. Michael Kirk, executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association in Alexandria, Va., said patent examiners must be lawyers with advanced degrees in engineering, software or biotechnology. <p> " I was at the patent office in the 1980s when the first wave of biotech patents hit, and we had to hire examiners to qualify them, " said Kirk, a former assistant patent commissioner. " We called in some industry folks and asked, How much would we have to pay these people? ' They came up with a figure higher than the salary of the secretary of commerce. " <p> No one would argue that patents have become the ticket to riches in our high-tech economy. And American history is replete with stories of inventors like Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell, whose patented inventions spawned corporate giants like General Electric and AT &T.; <p> But it 's less well known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940s and the 1980s. The number of patents issued each year stagnated or grew slowly, at best. <p> John Lynch, a veteran patent attorney in Menlo Park, said the reason was simple : The federal courts basically were unfriendly to patent-infringement cases. Trials were argued before federal judges, who made stingy damage awards. Even worse, appellate courts across the nation routinely reduced awards or dismissed infringement cases -- making patents into paper tigers. <p> In 1982, however, a procedural reform had far-reaching implications for patents. The courts ordained a single group of judges in Washington, D.C. -- the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit -- to hear all appeals in patent cases. It became, in essence, a mini-Supreme Court for patent law and began upholding patents. <p> This patent-friendly appeals court also helped expand the definition of inventions to include things like strands of DNA, software -- during the early days of the PC revolution, no one dreamed of patenting software -- even business processes like conducting reverse auctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Patent applications began rising in the mid-1980s and have been ballooning ever since. The Patent Office received 243,062 applications last year, more than twice as many as it fielded just 15 years ago. <p> Kevin Rivette, chief executive of Aurigin Systems in Mountain View, said the changes in patent behavior, sparked by the court reforms, have made U.S. high-tech and biotech startups the envy of the world. <p> " When entrepreneurs are trying to raise venture capital, the first question they get is how they expect to protect their market from bigger competitors, " Rivette said. " A patent is the best answer. " <p> Rivette 's firm sells software to help companies plot their patent strategies. He also co-authored a new book, " Rembrandts in the Attic, " that explains how to make the most aggressive use of patents. <p> Rivette said that during past eras of innovation, like the rise of the telegraph and electrical industries in the late 19th century and the airplane and auto era in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would thwart progress. <p> " What happens is that the Patent Office and the courts eventually correct these imbalances, " Rivette said. <p> But Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences and a former University of California professor, wonders if the current patent fever differs from past outbreaks. <p> For one thing, universities have gotten into the patent race. They used to be ivory towers, above the commercial fray. Nowadays, professors file patents, raise venture capital and start companies. Alberts fears that this may encourage secrecy and inhibit the free exchange of ideas, which traditionally has helped advance science and innovation. <p> " We have patent laws for the purpose of stimulating technological discovery, " Alberts said. " What we have to ask is whether our current intellectual property policies are still appropriate given the tremendous changes in technology. " <p> The National Academy of Science will convene a meeting of 30 experts tomorrow at the University of California at Berkeley 's Boalt Hall to begin mulling a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Has the patent system gone too far? <p> " Over the last decade, we 've had a renaissance of technology and prosperity in America driven in large part by patented inventions, " said Yale University President Richard Levin, an economist by training. " At the same time, there 's a concern we may have gone too far and taken too many steps to protect inventors. " <p> But even those who express such concerns are leery of tinkering with a system that has become the envy of the world. <p> " I 'm somewhat concerned the pendulum may have swung too far toward valuing patents, " said Donald Chisum, patent law professor at Santa Clara University. " But we 're beating the socks off Europe and Japan in part because of our venture financing system, which is directly tied to patents. <p> " I would hesitate about an overreaction the other way, " Chisum said.
