3004441 <p> As he stands on the threshold of his second inauguration, Bill Clinton poses a paradox for the party he leads. <p> Like no Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt, he has managed to capture the White House for a second term. Yet he did so by accepting many basic principles of the Republicans, while staving off their most ambitious assaults on Government. <p> Mr. Clinton was not able to carry Democrats back into control of Congress. He built much of his political comeback on distancing himself equally from both parties in Congress. Now as he prepares to take his second oath of office on Monday, the question is whether this ever-fluid leader stands as a party of one or whether he can redefine the Democrats and keep peace among factions that submerged their differences in 1996 in the interest of preventing the Republicans from winning both Congress and the White House. <p> " It 's very fundamental, " said Will Marshall, the president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research organization of centrist Democrats. " Democrats have yet to coalesce around a post-New Deal governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats is still uncharted. He himself has said his agenda " is n't liberal or conservative -- it 's both and it 's different. " <p> Appearing before centrist Democrats late last year, he reminded them of the themes on which he had first run for President : " This era requires a Government that neither attempts to solve problems for people, nor leaves them alone to fend for themselves. Instead we envision a Government that gives people the tools to solve their own problems and make the most of their own lives. " <p> Yet what that means in practice remains elusive, for Mr. Clinton has had two such distinct periods in his Presidency that his aides acknowledge they could be viewed as separate terms. In his first two years in office, he failed to persuade a Democratic Congress to enact a number of the fundamental changes he had promised the country : universal health care coverage, restructuring of the welfare system and a cleansing of the campaign finance system. <p> After the Republicans won control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their most extreme proposals by making a stand for Medicaid, Medicare, education programs and the environment. Yet he acceded to the Republicans ' goal of creating a balanced budget and he signed a Republican welfare bill that went further than anything he had previously envisioned. <p> Mr. Clinton 's partisans say the President reminded Americans at the height of the Republican Revolution of what they value in Government. Noting that the Republicans have moderated their tone on issues like education and the environment, Vice President Al Gore said, " It 's a measure of how far President Clinton has come in defining not only the Democratic Party but also the center of gravity in our country. " <p> Yet even those who share his " New Democrat " credentials say Mr. Clinton, in his final term, must persuade doubters within his own party that his promise is real, that Government can be not only smaller but also activist and more effective. <p> " There is a new political debate which is struggling to be born here, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party who sees and then seizes the terms of debate, " said Bill Curry, who recently resigned as counselor to the President to teach at Yale University. <p> " The New Democrats have much of what is required, " Mr. Curry said, " a belief in the devolution of power, fiscal restraint, smallness of scale, public-private partnerships and free markets. The question is, if that 's all there is to it, then there 's also a really useful name for the people who believe in it -- Republicans. " <p> Much of what Mr. Clinton provided for his party in the campaign was a new symbolism. He used small-scale family-based proposals to show middle-class America that he shared its values on issues like crime, education and welfare and that Democrats did not stand simply for redistribution of middle-class tax dollars to the poor and for 60 's counterculture values. <p> " He 's buried the daggers that were aimed at our heart, " said Mr. Clinton 's former adviser George Stephanopoulos, " weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and that 's a significant accomplishment. " At the same time, many Democrats applaud him for being able to keep their party in favor of abortion rights and gun control. <p> The symbolism came linked to proposals that are a shadow of what Mr. Clinton once represented. But his approach reflects an understanding, his aides say, that Americans at this moment do not want grand change but do want some help in taking control of their lives. <p> Where once Mr. Clinton wanted universal health care coverage, now he has called for legislation to allow laid-off workers to be able to keep their health insurance for six months. His budget proposal is also expected to extend Medicaid coverage to more poor children. <p> Where he once had a welfare plan with the premise that putting people to work would be more expensive than giving them checks, now the President, who signed into law $54 billion in savings as part of the Republican welfare overhaul, is trying to ameliorate what he signed and restore $16.4 billion. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has said he would delegate students from the National Service program to be reading tutors to promote third grade literacy. Using two separate proposals -- a $10,000 tax deduction or a $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of postsecondary school -- Mr. Clinton has also said he wants to make two years of higher education as universal as high school. <p> Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said his top priority for his last term is to balance the budget by the year 2002, an action his advisers believe will end a debate that has divided Congress for more than a decade. <p> Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton 's new chief of staff, calls the achievement of a balanced budget essential for economic growth. <p> " You free up an enormous amount of capital that would go to deficits so that it can go to the private sector to invest in new tools and equipment and machinery that makes American companies more competitive and more productive, " Mr. Bowles said. " By being such they can earn higher profits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this darn wage stagnation that 's been bedeviling this country for a long time. Is that liberal of conservative? Who knows, O.K.? But wage stagnation is something we 've got to deal with in this country. " <p> Yet it is precisely on questions of budget priorities, and economic policy that the Democratic Party is most divided. Democrats, as well as Republicans, still face decisions on how much to rein in spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as what kinds of trade-offs to make in cutting domestic programs or the military. <p> As a result, two distinct Democratic camps have emerged, distinguished largely by how they view the global information age. <p> On one side, moderate New Democrats joined by architects of Mr. Clinton 's re-election campaign say Democrats should concentrate on ways to help the family and make pensions and health insurance portable at a time when workers can no longer count on lifetime job security. This faction is more amenable to scaling back and reshaping the entitlement programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government should stress education to better prepare workers for the age of technology. <p> On the other side, a coalition of liberals and organized labor, including some strategists of Mr. Clinton 's first campaign, argue that Democrats should safeguard the existing entitlement programs and make deeper cuts in military programs to free up money for domestic needs. <p> They are leery of free trade agreements that do not include provisions to discourage American business from moving across borders for cheaper labor. And they would like to see Government use the tax code to goad corporations to invest more in their own workers. <p> " You will see the progressive wing of the Democratic Party start to reassert itself, " said Robert L. Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America 's Future, a research group established to counter the centrist Democrats. " It will be beginning on fights over the budget, depending on what the President does, and real fights on trade. " <p> If Mr. Clinton 's hopes of being able to work with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he can navigate without liberal Democratic defectors in Congress to enact a legislative program. <p> But at what cost to his heir apparent, Vice President Gore? Many Democrats predict that today 's divisions will solidify into a primary challenge to Mr. Gore for the Democratic nomination in four years. <p> " You 'll start to see more of the traditional debates in the Democratic Party, " said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who was the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. " How that debate is waged, how acrimonious it is will determine whether it is helpful or harmful.
