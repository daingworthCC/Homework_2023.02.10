4115941 To match the striking developments in today 's minivan market, you might have to go back to the seminal launch in 1983, when Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca accidentally was locked inside the company 's then-revolutionary new minivan and could n't sling open the sliding side door and hop out, as planned, at the introduction. # The superstitious at Chrysler surely shuddered, fearing that moment was harbinger of minivan failure. # Instead, family vans there 's been nothing " mini " about them for years enjoyed two strong decades, before sport-utility vehicles began to siphon buyers. # Sales have tumbled to fewer than half the 1.4 million peak in 2000, and family vans share of the new-vehicle market is about 4%, less than half the zenith of 8.5% in 1995, according to J.D. Power and Associates data. # Now, in what must resemble bald guys fighting over a comb, the few remaining family-van makers have plowed tens of millions of dollars into new and updated vans hoping for modest pieces of a small market. # They are trying luxury features, working to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally beating each other 's brains out for sales that all players combined are about enough to keep two big factories running hard. # Why? Profits, of course. Minivans, it turns out, have become big-ticket items. # " Buyers are willing to pay the $40,000 for a Honda Odyssey or Chrysler Town &amp; Country to get all the bells and whistles, " says Jeff Schuster, executive director of forecasting at consultant J.D. Power and Associates. # " It 's not a price or payment issue, " because family van buyers already have decided that only a well-furnished van suits their needs, says Bruce Velisek, who oversees the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. # At Honda, about 75% of Odyssey sales are models priced at $35,230 and up, says Sage Marie, U.S. product planning manager in charge of vans, SUVs and Honda 's sole pickup, Ridgeline. By contrast, he says, " Only 7% of volume is the LX, our entry Odyssey, " which starts at $28,580. # Honda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it about 24% of the minivan market, a modest number of vehicles by industry standards, but even so, Marie says, " We can make money in the minivan business. " # Toyota had about 21% of minivan sales last year. Chrysler Group 's Town &amp; Country and the similar Grand Caravan, combined, had about 47%. The crumbs went to Kia and to Volkswagen in effect, to Chrysler, which builds the VW van on the same line as its own T&amp;C and Grand Caravan. # Nicely appointed vans # To evaluate the high-end, high-profit vans that make the small market worthwhile, USA TODAY, Cars.com and the MotorWeek TV show convened the Ultimate Minivan Shootout, a comparison test among well-equipped vans priced from about $34,000 to $43,000, without shipping charges. # A suburban Atlanta family was recruited to help judge the vans, ensuring that real-world considerations were n't overlooked. And the family Travis and Heather Weatherby and their three children ranging from 15 down to 1 year old made the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to minimize or eliminate debt, and spent a lot of time with the $35,000 Volkswagen Routan, second-lowest-price of the group. " I like this, I like this, " Heather, 41, said several times. " It has all the features I really enjoy " for an attractive price, Travis, 31, noted. # But in the end, their highest scores went to the loaded $43,000 Honda Odyssey, even though they agree that it was n't the best value, and they judged the visibility mediocre. # Scores from professional auto reviewers who made up the panel of judges also favored Odyssey, making it the overall winner. # The average transaction price for a family van has jumped to about $32,000 or $33,000 from about $30,000 less than two years ago, before the Chrysler Group, Toyota and Honda all introduced new vans, and Nissan returned to the family van market, says Velisek. # Schuster sees family vans as a stable or gently growing market. # Automakers say buyers are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the family-first image a van projects. Some makers also suspect that kids who grew up feeling bored and dorkified in their parents SUVs, once they hit parenthood will reject their ill-remembered SUVs and re-embrace vans. # Supporting the minivan market : # Huge pool of potential buyers. By the industry 's count, some 60 millon Generation Xers 30 to 44 years old, followed by 80 million Millennials ages 15 to 29. That trumps the 70 million Baby Boomers, Chrysler notes, so the odds are favorable. # Van fans. Most minivans are bought by minivan owners who want another, J.D. Power reports, so there 's a good-size pool of likely customers loyal to vans. # Aging Boomers. Retirees who want to haul grandkids or travel in roomy comfort are settling on minivans more often, automakers agree. # To encourage automakers to load up their vans for the shootout, the price limit was a generous $45,000 before shipping was added. # The only no-show was Kia, which says it had no Sedona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around Atlanta, rotating drivers through the vans, three facts quickly were clear : # Family vans are big as hefty a footprint as a full-size SUV such as the Chevrolet Tahoe. # The first Chryslers back in the 1980s really were mini. The Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Plymouth Voyager were built atop compact-car chassis, were smaller than the full-size delivery-style vans then in vogue among customizers( shag carpet, big stereo speakers, faux wood consoles with the first cup holders) and some nomadic individuals who did n't like the Volkswagen Bus popular with wanderers of the time. # A true minivan, or perhaps " mini-minivan, " market is aborning, however. The Mazda5 is about 2 feet shorter than a conventional family van. It seats six, instead of seven or eight, and starts at about $20,000. Ford promises the similar-size C-max, though wo n't say exactly when, or what price to expect. Schuster forecasts mid-2012 or later. # He expects Chrysler and Fiat to combine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but timing and details are unknown. # New entries usually spur new interest, and Mazda expects the true minivan market to get more attention as rivals arrive. # There 's nothing " mini " about the vans fuel appetite, either. The government fuel-economy ratings outdo those of truck-based big SUVs but are n't much better than the ratings of the full-size Chevrolet Traverse and Ford Flex crossover SUVs that family-vanless GM and Ford offer as substitutes. # Our mileage run showed real-world fuel economy ranging from about 21 to 26 mpg in mostly highway driving. # Double-checking on varied routes, not part of the official scoring, showed mileages typically in the midteens, which is similar to crossover SUVs. # Automakers idea of their " ultimate " vans varied, usually coming in well under our price limit. # Honda took the greatest advantage of the $45,000 ceiling and supplied a $43,250 Odyssey Touring Elite( $44,030 with shipping). # Toyota was close, at $41,144( $41,944 with shipping), largely because the Sienna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers AWD, and 15% to 20% of Sienna buyers pick it, says Rich Bame, national manager of truck and van marketing for Toyota in the U.S. # Seats always have been a key minivan feature. Today 's high-price vans have taken that to a new plateau. If you have n't shopped for a family van lately, you might be surprised to hear that the second-row seats in the Sienna fold back in La-Z-Boy lounge fashion. And the Chrysler and Dodge second rows can fold down under the floor to leave a fat, flat space without removing the seats. # Rear entertainment systems likewise have evolved, and today 's video screens sprawl up to 16 inches, wide enough to display two video programs side-by-side. # The lure of fancy features alone, though, is unlikely to convert what the auto industry calls " resisters " people strongly reluctant to buy a minivan. # Dodge has the R/T " man van " black interior, leather upholstery, sporting suspension to counter the soccer-Mom image. And a Toyota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet. A J.D. Power evaluation says, " The campaign appears to have influenced current, and prospective, minivan owners as well as garnered interest from an audience who previously would not have considered a minivan. " # J.D. Power analyst Steve Witten says the slight image change has bled into other brands of vans : " Just as Bill Gates made being a nerd cool, these campaigns, if done correctly, can go a far way in helping boost minivan sales.
