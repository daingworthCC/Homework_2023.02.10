4189341 <p> COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Republicans can count on winning South Carolina in November. And the state 's flagship campus is likewise overwhelmingly Republican. But there are still plenty of Democrats, and while they 're badly outnumbered, boy were they thrilled to see Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. <p> The self-proclaimed democratic socialist packed an auditorium at the University of South Carolina with hundreds of cheering students. The line stretched far out of the door of the student union building, and Sanders gave 10 minutes to over 100 students shut out of the main event by fire marshals and police. <p> " Democracy is a big deal.... Democracy -- and I know I say this in South Carolina -- unlike football, football is a spectator sport. Democracy is not a spectator sport... It 's your job to fight for your rights, " the 74-year-old Sanders told the overflow crowd. <p> His fans included international students, who liked his views on reducing income inequality and addressing social injustice. <p> " I like the fact that it 's really close to European states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Marco Spessotto, 24, a graduate student in international business from Venice, Italy. " The U.S. is seen as the most capitalistic country. Definitely, Europeans would like what they hear. " <p> Thore Konrad, 24, a native of Frankfurt, Germany, who also studies international business at South Carolina, agreed and said Sanders ' appeal to young people makes sense. <p> " He 's like the older statesman who know all about politics. He 's like the granddad, and he knows everything, " he said. <p> Sanders decried Republicans for proclaiming climate change a hoax and for aiming at the wrong targets when they talk about reforming welfare. He promoted health care as a right. <p> As for welfare, he said, the biggest abusers are n't the poor, as Republicans insist ; they 're major employers such as Wal-Mart that pay employees so little, many qualify for food stamps, subsidized housing and Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. <p> " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America is the wealthiest family in America -- the Walton family, " Sanders said, speaking in front of a banner that read " A FUTURE TO BELIEVE IN. " " Let 's get the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family, off of welfare. Let 's have them pay their workers a living wage. " <p> South Carolina 's Democratic primary is Feb. 27, a week after the GOP primary. <p> Some of his biggest cheers came when he argued for tuition-free public college. Nearly every hand in the room went up when he asked how many of the students expected to emerge from college in debt. <p> " Is this a radical idea? No, " he said. " We want the best educated population in the world, do we not? " <p> He also took aim at police brutality. " We are tired -- I am -- of seeing videos of unarmed people being killed by police officers, " he said, asserting that police have used unjustified force for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only come to light in recent years. <p> To post a comment, log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.
