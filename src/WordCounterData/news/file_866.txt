In 2016, he found a home at center and started 27 games there in his final two seasons. <p> Shelton was named first-team All-Pac-12 in 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL with some college accolades to his name. He went undrafted in 2018 and first landed with the 49ers as a free agent. <p> With Shelton joining the 53-man roster, the Rams now have nine offensive linemen available.
