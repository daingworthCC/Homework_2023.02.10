3062341 <p> Jim Graham plopped a small rectangle of chocolate ganache onto the dark tempered chocolate in his dipping tank. This was the seventh candy hed created as I watched, fascinated. <p> The process was the same every time, but each hand-dipped candy was a miniature, deliciously edible sculpture. A hand-dipped treasure no bigger than a Hershey Kiss, although its not fair to mention the two in the same sentence. The world wouldnt be the same without Hershey Kisses, but Grahams chocolates are in an entirely different league. <p> Graham, himself, is in rather exclusive company. There are nt many people in the Midwest, or in the United States, for that matter, who know as much about chocolate and specialize in making and teaching it. Graham has been a chocolatier for 15 years. He worked for four years in Paris and for 10 at Le Francais in Wheeling. <p> These days he makes candies for restaurants and handles private projects, such as decorated three-tiered wedding cakes only 2 inches tall. He also teaches at Kendall College and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this year by chefs Patrick Chabert and Michel Coatrieux. Grahams classes at the Experience include tempering, candies made in molds, hand-dipped chocolates and copeaux, small decorations such as ruffles and cigarettes. In his typically low-key way, Graham calls his outside consulting 44odd jobs. <p> Odd? No. Try extraordinary. He s known across the country, although he would be the last one to say so. I regarded his classes as early Christmas gifts to myself. <p> Back at the dipping tank, the little rectangle began to sink. Before the fragrant chocolate could engulf it, Graham put the tines of a candy fork on one edge and pushed the piece down. It flipped luxuriantly through the chocolate and emerged, resting on the fork, now upside down and wearing a glossy brown coat. <p> Tilting the fork slightly toward himself, he slapped the rectangle smartly against the surface of the chocolate, using its viscosity to pull excess chocolate off the new candy and back into the tank. Next he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down, barely touching the dipping chocolate. <p> Properly coated, the little candy could now join the others he had made. It settled on the white paper and began forming its foot, the tiny rim of chocolate around the bottom edge. <p> Graham touched the still-soft top with the fork and lifted three diagonal parallel webs of chocolate. A quick, short move to the right broke the connection, and the three partitions settled into decorative ridges. He picked up another chocolate rectangle and plopped it onto the perfectly tempered mass in the tank, and the process started again. <p> In the time it has taken to read this far, Graham could hand-dip at least half a dozen candies -- probably more -- all nearly identical. And, incidentally, his clothes would be clean. Halfway through his Saturday morning hand-dipping class at the Experience, my previously white apron was mostly chocolatey brown. I could almost hear the stuff laughing at me. <p> Graham had taken us through tempering -- the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature. In an earlier class, he had distributed a handout listing melting and crystallization temperatures for the four stages of chocolate.( Gamma, alpha, beta prime and beta, in case youre ever on 44Jeopardy and $ 10,000 is riding on that information.) <p> He must have seen the alarm on our faces -- we were expecting chocolate, not chemistry, for petes sake -- so he gave us only as much as we needed to know. 44Youll be able to temper chocolate, although you may not know why, he said gently. We felt better. <p> Temper, temper <p> Graham uses several brands of chocolate, Valrhona and Callebaut among them. For the tempering demonstration, he poured melted chocolate onto a marble-topped table. It oozed freely onto the surface and spread into a puddle. Using an 8-inch stainless steel scraper available at hardware stores, he pushed the chocolate over the marble to lower the temperature of the lovely goo. <p> He stirred uniformly around the edges and through the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature dropped to about 73 degrees and islands of crystals began to form. <p> Tempering works on a rather short temperature scale and is precise, depending on the kind of chocolate youre working on. 44You cant intuit your way through it, Graham agreed. But you can learn chocolates visual and thermal language. <p> He pointed to the wrinkle that formed just ahead of the scraper as he pushed. He uses an infrared thermometer -- a point and click device with a digital readout -- to check temperatures. An instant-read thermometer is too slow to keep up with the changes in the chocolate, he said. And that need for precision makes home projects rather difficult. Small batches are harder to temper because they change temperature more quickly than large amounts. The wrinkle is a good signal to know. It shows that crystals are beginning to form and its time to pour the chocolate back into the vat. <p> Graham stirred the mass, noting the thickening. The crystals were lining up 44shoulder to shoulder, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more heat. This time, because he was aiming for a small, specific temperature increase, Graham used a heat gun( back to the hardware store). He pointed it at the chocolate and stirred. The mass loosened nicely as it approached 88 degrees, his target. <p> 44Not above 90, or else youll have to re-temper, he said. A double-boiler is 44almost certainly too hot, but a hairdryer will do, he said, provided you use a diffuser -- one of those plastic attachments that spreads the air flow. Otherwise, you could blow chocolate all over the kitchen. <p> He tested the chocolate by spreading a bit on parchment. Within two minutes the little smear was dry and shiny smooth. The crystal was too small for the human eye to pick out -- just what he wanted. If the chocolate is kept at the correct temperature -- Graham uses an inexpensive heating pad covered in plastic wrap -- and is stirred frequently, it can be used all day without re-tempering. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempered dipping chocolate, and he had set out a supply of solid chocolate rectangles, which are sturdier than ganache centers because ganache contains cream and butter( see accompanying recipe). 44Ill be proud of you if you come up with two or three nice pieces by the end of the class, he said, handing over his fork. <p> We took turns, dipping three rectangles apiece. My first one cooperated, somersaulting in the chocolate, but it slid off the fork when I tried to slap it against the surface. Try again ; thats better. OK, move it onto the paper. <p> Now for the ridges on top. Lower the fork just so. Raise it gently and -- zip -- well, not quite. 44You have to pull straight across, Graham said. <p> Even with an expert guide and equipment designed for success, hand-dipping is a challenge. My chocolates turned out OK in class, so I decided to try it at home, in spite of Grahams warning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with blobs. Delicious, but way too homely to be in the same box with Grahams exquisite candies. Astonishingly, five crystallized quickly and were shiny. I was surprised because both of my thermometers stuck in the low 80s, one long after the chocolate had crystallized around it. I ended up using an appetizer fork after I accidentally snapped the prongs off the candy fork. But still, five were OK -- sort of. <p> The rest simply refused to set. And who could blame them? Those, I ate with a spoon. <p> For information on the French Culinary Experience, call( 847) 215-1931. <p> Earl Grey tea ganache <p> MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS <p> 2 tablespoons corn syrup( optional, see Note) <p> 1 1/4 cups whipping cream <p> 2 tablespoons Earl Grey tea( loose tea) <p> 2 cups dark chocolate( such as Valrhona 56 percent cacao), chopped <p> 1/3 cup milk chocolate( such as Callebaut), chopped <p> 4 tablespoons( 1/2 stick) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syrup in a saucepan.
