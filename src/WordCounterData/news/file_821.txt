5020541 <p> SAVANNAH, Ohio - Measuring a bit more than a square half-mile, the northern Ashland County village of Savannah has one restaurant, a tiny park and one other thing - a gnarled apple tree that is certified as the last survivor of the thousands planted by Johnny Appleseed more than 150 years ago. <p> And it 's still producing apples, sometimes too many. <p> " It gives us tons of apples, " said Barbara Morgan, a descendant of John Harvey who bought the land almost two centuries ago. " Last summer we had to cut some branches off and prop others up with poles because we feared the weight of the apples would break the branches. " <p> Another family member, Dick Algeo, 91, remembers how his grandmother used to tell stories about how John Chapman, who became known as Johnny Appleseed, planted several apple orchards in the area around Savannah. Chapman even stayed on their farm, though he slept in the corn crib because he disliked sleeping indoors. <p> The Algeo family has lived on the huge farm which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1834, under an 1826 land grant signed by President John Quincy Adams. Dick 's great-granddaughter, Amy Paramore-Sheaffer, and her family live in the main house on County Road 658 west of Savannah. The famous tree is just outside her kitchen door. <p> Ohio Tiny Towns is an occasional Plain Dealer series exploring some of the state 's lesser-known towns and villages. If you have an idea for a town you 'd like to see profiled, email msangiacomo@plaind.com <p> For years, the family used chains and props to hold the trunk of the old tree together, but several years ago a mighty wind proved more than it could handle. The central trunk of the tree split and fell to the earth. A fragile piece of the trunk remains and new two branches from its base are now 20 feet high and produce apples. <p> Dick Sommer of the museum said the secret of the tree 's longevity lies in its location. <p> " It was planted right over an underground aquifer by John Chapman and those roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That spring has been feeding that tree ever since. " <p> No one is quite sure when the tree was planted, but Chapman walked the land and sowed his seeds until his death in Fort Wayne Indiana in 1845. Despite legends, and Disney cartoons, Chapman did not drop seeds everywhere he walked. He planted orchards on private property and made deals with the owners to share in the bounty. <p> " He planted thousands of Rambo apple trees in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana in the 1800s, " said Joe Besecker, director emeritus of the Johnny Appleseed Museum. " The Rambo apple is a tart, cooking apple. It 's large and matures in August. The trees are tenacious, very hard to kill. It was very important to the settlers who used it to make apple butter, cider, pies, juice and apple vinegar. " <p> Local officials said they remember that about 40 years ago there were three or four Johnny Appleseed trees alive in the area, but they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certificate of authenticity of the last living apple tree planted by Johnny Appleseed presented in 1991 by the American Forests organization of Washington, D.C. <p> " We do n't advertise that the tree is here, but people still find us, " said Paramore-Sheaffer. " We get four or five groups a year of people who want to see the famous tree. Last year, an 89-year-old woman said she had wanted to see the last Johnny Appleseed tree her whole life. I gave her a clipping from the tree which she was going to try to grow. I hope she succeeded. " <p> As Paramore-Sheaffer talked, she whipped something in a bowl. A short time later she pulled a tray of apple cookies from the oven. <p> " These are apple cookies made from applesauce from apples we took off the tree last year, " she said. " It 's my grandmother 's recipe. Everyone loves them. " <p> Savannah an escape from modern stress. <p> Amy, 26, grew up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safe. " She said she ca n't imagine ever living anywhere else. <p> " What can I say? I love living out here, listening to the occasional clip-clop of Amish horse-drawn buggies, enjoying the peace. There is a sense of camaraderie here. We all know one another. I could never leave. " <p> Knowing many of the village residents is not that hard, there were only 409 people living in Savannah in the 2010 census. There is North and South Main Street and a few intersecting streets, a few churches, an ancient graveyard and little else in Savannah. <p> The best( and only) restaurant in town. <p> Mandy Close is the latest owner of the only sit-down restaurant in the village. She said there has always been a restaurant on Main Street since the 1960s when it was a Perkin 's Pancake House. The restaurant changed hands and names many times since then, before Close took it over five years ago. <p> " This place gets so crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said. " I do n't know where they all park. A lot of them are on their way to somewhere else. We have our locals of course, the Guns and Coffee Club meets in the back room and the VFW meets here as well. " <p> She said the diners pass through the village on their way north on U.S. 250 to Norwalk, Cedar Point and Lake Erie, or south heading for Ashland, Mansfield and Columbus. <p> And they do move. <p> Ignoring the 35 mile per hour speed limit, they zoom through the village. <p> " It can be dangerous just crossing the street, " said Tom Kruse, who has been the town mayor for 22 years. " We have not had a police department for a very long time. The Ashland County sheriff 's department covers us, but often they only have two cars out on patrol and they seldom make it out here. Fortunately, no one has ever been killed crossing the street. " <p> Bicentennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the village are getting ready for its bicentennial on the weekend of July 23 - 25. <p> " The town museum will be open, we 'll have a parade, a pancake breakfast, a pollock fish dinner and lots of old-fashioned things to do like the skillet toss contest and sack races. " <p> The mobile POW-MIA wall will be set up in town for the bicentennial as well as a " Touch the Truck " exhibit of modern and antique fire trucks for children to see. <p> Kruse is proud of his little town, with its memorial park on Main Street, its tiny museum and its small-town, homey atmosphere. <p> " We love it out here in the country, " he said. " The kids ride their bikes and play in the woods and the creeks. It 's quiet. " <p> Local resident remembers a more bustling village. <p> Bill Biddinger, 74, is a retired cabinet maker and the curator of the tiny town museum. He looks around the small town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand. Like the town garage and the five gas stations, the stores are long gone. <p> He walks to the town post office to pick up his mail. <p> He takes pride in keeping up the town museum, though he rarely opens it for business. It 's located in a house next to his own home. The two-room tribute to the town has yearbooks, military items, flags and many pictures of life in the village over the decades. <p> Ultimately, like the mayor explained, the village 's claim to fame is the Johnny Appleseed tree on the Algeo farm. <p> " What else are we known for? " he mused. " Well, a local man was given the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Civil War, that 's the most famous person we 've ever had. The tree is our best-known feature. It 's something I know well. I am an arborist and I have been caring for that old tree for years. " <p> Want to buy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appleseed in Savannah?
