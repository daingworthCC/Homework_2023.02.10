If this tax is not repealed, it will leave Ohio small businesses at a disadvantage relative to small businesses in other states. <p> This new Financial Institutions Tax in Ohio unintentionally captures small-business investment companies. SBICs are federally licensed investment partnerships that provide critical capital to finance U.S. small businesses. For example, since 2010, the SBIC program has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The tax is assessed on Ohio-based assets, which is clearly a disincentive for SBICs to invest in Ohio-based companies. No other state in the U.S. has this tax on their books, and this could increase the cost of capital for Ohio small businesses or cause SBICs to prefer to invest in other states. <p> The arguments we made to leaders of the Ohio House have resulted in new legislation repealing this tax. We are thankful for the support of state Reps. Derek Merrin, R-Waterville ; Ron Amstutz, R-Wooster ; Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster ; Scott Ryan, R-Newark ; and Ryan Smith, R-Bidwell. We hope others can in Ohio can join with them and repeal this tax by the end of the year. <p> I know firsthand how important SBIC capital is to the lifeblood of American companies. My company, Oxer Capital Inc., located in Columbus, manages a licensed SBIC and we are proud to work with small businesses to find capital that is necessary to expand their facilities, hire more workers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being a resource for small businesses as they search for capital in the future as well, but in order to do so in Ohio, we need this unfair and unintended tax off the books.
