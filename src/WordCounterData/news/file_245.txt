3045441 <p> When it comes to the economy, even optimists are nervous about something. <p> More than three years after recession, reports on the economy offer reason to be both upbeat and concerned. Economic growth has been solid, but has been slowing. Job growth has been positive, but erratic. <p> In this unpredictable time, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked a randomly chosen cross section of people in metro Atlanta what they worry about. <p> Role in the world concerns young people <p> They were born toward the end of Ronald Reagan 's second term. As they have approached adulthood, the nation has swerved through a technology boom, a recession, a terrorist attack and two wars -- along with an uncertain economic recovery. <p> The seniors in Patti Pair 's advanced placement economics class are on the cusp of graduation from Chattahoo-chee High School. Soon they will head for universities and then into a job market that is increasingly global. <p> And for some, there is cause for concern in how the American economy is becoming more entangled with those around the world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to India, the design of new products, " said Nathan Nee. " That is removing American innovation to other countries. " <p> In a discussion paralleled in Washington and across the United States, Nee and some other students said they fear erosion -- not just of American expertise but of the nation 's standard of living. <p> The shift of work toward lower-wage nations does not bode well for job seekers, Nee said. " What kinds of jobs will be safe? Maybe some of the more specialized fields. " <p> Other students argued that the fear is misplaced, that the United States should surrender some industries to lower-cost countries. <p> Like the national debate, the classroom conversation frames concerns about the future. <p> Is globalization toxic, a poisonous environment that will slowly eat away hopes for affluence? Or are the problems temporary, a distraction from greater dangers elsewhere? <p> Globalization is a nearly irresistible force, and it is gathering speed, said Adelbola Adedire. <p> " There are lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point, " Adedire said. " I think that prices will start to even out. Maybe right now for people whose jobs can be outsourced, it 's a big worry. The transition will be bad for some people. " <p> The United States should try to compete by emphasizing its strengths and avoiding weaknesses, said John Warden. <p> " There is no way that a company in the United States can produce McDonald 's Happy Meals toys, " he said. " Our economy is n't based on production. It 's based on services. " <p> For his money, the most ominous threat is the price of energy. <p> " Oil prices are the biggest worry, " he said. " We do n't have much control over the supply of oil, and oil is connected to so many parts of the economy. " <p> OIL ONLY A PORTION <p> Oil is just part of an unstable global arrangement, said economist Kashif S. Mansori of Colby College in Maine. <p> Americans buy much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said. <p> " The No. 1 worry for me is that the trade deficit is unsustainable. If -- that is, when -- the rest of the world stops lending the U.S. so much money, what will happen to the U.S. economy? " <p> The linchpin of the lending machine is the foreign banks that put money into dollars and buy U.S. assets and securities. That keeps long-term American interest rates lower, he said. <p> " What 's going to change things is when the central banks change their mind. If that changes, if our line of credit runs out, we could be heading for trouble. Interest rates will go up a lot, and it could prick the housing bubble. And that could have an effect on consumer behavior. " <p> DO N'T OVERREACT <p> The economy is essentially healthy, said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. <p> The greatest danger is from within, he said. A strong economy may be used to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past week showed surprisingly solid job creation in April, with robust growth in retail sales. Optimists say the economy has emerged from a " soft patch. " <p> The Federal Reserve has been nudging short-term rates up since last June to nip rising inflation. The Fed could be emboldened now, Dhawan said. " The one thing that really worries me is that the Federal Reserve Bank will overreact to the strong numbers and will drop its measured pace of rate increases. " <p> SKILLS WILL TELL <p> Rising interest rates? Maybe that 's too much of a short-term issue. <p> What matters to future success is how we prepare ourselves for the future, said Stacey DeWitt, founder, president and chief executive of CWK Network. It 's a 7-year-old company that produces and distributes programs for television stations, schools and community groups. <p> " Right now, there is a bit of a disconnect between what is required for the economy to thrive and the work force that we are building, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American transformation. <p> " The economy has changed. We have gone from a manufacturing economy to services -- and a different skill set is needed. Schools have not been in sync with all this. It 's a different skill set now than it was a couple of decades ago. " <p> Yet each time there 's a budget crunch, schools look first at what they think are " supplementary programs, " she said. " When we cut out things like character development and ethical issues, cut things like decision-making, we cut programs that teach the broader, higher-level skills that are critical now. " <p> " I do think it 's an economic threat. At some point, the economy is driven by skills that people provide. That is much more than a discussion about passing standardized tests. " <p> UNTREATED PROBLEM <p> Oil? That 's just a short-term hurdle. The real big trouble -- and the big money -- could be in the nation 's health care costs, which account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see that the overall health care system is in crisis, but there is not a lot being done, " said Amri Johnson, founder and chief executive of Health Research Network, a small 4-year-old health care and human resources consulting company. <p> " Eventually, that is something that is going to pop, and that pop is going to affect everyone, " Johnson said. " This is going to be one of the most crucial elements of the economy -- how we handle health care -- much more than Social Security. " <p> Health costs are a growing drag on small companies, Johnson said. <p> " Employer costs will go up. Or there will be more employees without insurance. There will be layoffs.... To me, this is absolutely the most crucial thing. " <p> HOSPITALS HURTING <p> Consumers could find themselves bearing much heavier burdens for health care -- and having less access to it, said Eric Norwood, chief executive and president of DeKalb Medical Center. <p> Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. <p> " The average hospital in Georgia has 1 to 1.5 percent operating margin, " he said. " That 's analogous to a grocery store. You 've got an industry trying to exist on 1 percent margin and trying to maintain access to capital. That 's not sustainable. " <p> The number of Americans with no health insurance has grown. Many still get care, including many who can not afford it. But someone will pay, Norwood said. <p> " There is n't free medical care... only cost-shifting. " <p> Many companies that provide insurance to employees are making them pay more. Many others simply choose not to offer it at all. <p> " Mandating benefits, that would level the playing field, " Norwood said. <p> ENERGY THE LINK <p> Demand for company products depends on consumers, who worry about jobs. And job growth can be stymied by costs. <p> Energy could be the bridge that connects those issues, said Roy Krause, president and CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " I see an increased concern among employees and consumers. I 've got to believe that the concern is being led by oil prices. If there is something that worries me, it would be the oil prices. "
