3055641 <p> With their teams warming up before Saturday 's game, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich and the Timberwolves ' Flip Saunders met for a fairly typical exchange of pre-game small talk. But no one chatted about the weather or families. No one brought up the season so far. Saunders would not be so cruel. <p> Instead, Saunders immediately sought Tomjanovich 's position on wearing a microphone during games. <p> The issue has raised the blood pressure of NBA coaches more than referees Ronnie Nunn and Steve Javie combined. <p> On Sunday, the Raptors ' Butch Carter and Sonics ' Paul Westphal refused to be miked, and both teams Monday were fined $ 100,000. Jerry Sloan of the Jazz and Pat Riley of the Heat have moaned about the intrusion into their inner sanctum as if they were CIA operatives. The Manhattan Project did not merit the secrecy some league geniuses believe they deserve. <p> But when the Rockets face the Knicks tonight in Madison Square Garden, Tomjanovich will don a microphone for the third time this season. Tomjanovich, one of five coaches so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual doses of coaching paranoia. But he also was not so full of himself to believe his work more important than the league 's efforts to promote itself at a time when a little promotion is needed. <p> " I 'd rather not have to do that, but they think it adds something, " Tomjanovich said. " I really did feel safe when they said they would n't go live. They want to promote the league, and if there is an uncomfortable situation, those things would not be put on the air. " <p> The comments are taped and played later to give a feel for the game and its emotions. Comments about individual players and strategies, even about opposing weaknesses to attack, are not aired. Coaches can turn off the microphone at any time. <p> Still, with all the screaming around the league, one would think the NBA has demanded that coaches take turns working for Clippers owner Donald Sterling. <p> " The league has made a great effort, " Rockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the meetings. They 're trying to get interest about the league back. The lockout was kind of a negative. They want something positive. They think this will create interest for the game. <p> " It 's all designed to give an insight into the NBA, to pique the interest. In Rudy 's case, he does everything the right way. When he 's been miked and you show everything he does, it comes across that he has more of a funny side than people see. It makes these guys and players more human. <p> " Rudy has n't changed. Nothing 's changed. In Rudy 's case, the feedback I 've gotten is all positive. It 's so positive, it 's 100 percent. Nobody has said, ' Why are you doing that? ' or ' Why did you let that happen? ' Until there 's negative things, I 've got nothing bad to say about it. I do n't see why the NBA, protecting the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That is, of course, why so many coaches are screaming. Some are neurotic about opening another reason to second-guess them. Others do n't want to be exposed as the dictators they can be, especially to players they might have to attract in coming seasons. <p> For Tomjanovich, that might be the value of the added exposure. Already known as a players ' coach, a first impression forged with a one-liner on a Tuesday night could be remembered when Dawson makes those summer phone calls. <p> " I do n't know about that, " Tomjanovich said. " I just try to treat people right. " <p> And when someone demands secrecy, it 's impossible not to wonder what they 're trying to hide. <p> Statistical promotion - This week the Rockets will begin mailing information to beat reporters around the country to promote Steve Francis for Rookie of the Year and Cuttino Mobley for Sixth Man of the Year. <p> They will point to a section on the Rockets ' Web site promoting both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the league and has an area in which fans can send their thoughts. <p> But the best parts of these things are always the statistical discoveries that trumpet a player 's accomplishments. <p> For Francis, there are comparisons to other rookies and to past Rookie of the Year point guards. But the most impressive item might be Francis ' averages against last season 's NBA All-Defensive team guards. <p> In six games against Jason Kidd, Gary Payton and Mookie Blaylock, Francis has averaged 25.7 points, eight rebounds, nine assists and 1.67 steals. He has made 49.1 percent of his shots and 46.2 percent of his 3-pointers. <p> For Mobley, the statistic that jumps out is the most obvious one. He is first in scoring among NBA players with fewer than 10 starts, a list that includes Rodney Rogers, Chris Gatling, Predrag Stojakovic and Austin Croshere. <p> Drew an off guard - As his second season approaches its final 20 games, guard Bryce Drew has been replaced as Steve Francis ' primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had barely played at all through his two 10-day contracts. <p> Drew was labeled the Rockets ' future point guard when chosen in the first round of the 1998 draft. Even with the addition of Francis, Drew was so entrenched as a backup that the Rockets let Matt Maloney go with six years remaining on his contract. But in recent games Drew has worked almost exclusively as an off guard - when he has worked at all. <p> In three games before Thursday 's against the Jazz and Saturday 's against the Timberwolves( when he picked up a few more minutes as the Rockets played a game and a half without Cuttino Mobley and two games without Walt Williams), Drew averaged six minutes. He had averaged 19 minutes in the previous three games. <p> In the 14 games since his impressive two-game stint as a starter, Drew has made 22 of 66 shots. <p> Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich would not discuss Drew 's struggles or his change of the rotation other than to describe the " creativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norris handling the ball might help get him out of a shooting slump. <p> " It 's something that might help, " Drew said. " I have to set up and look to get my shot instead of getting other people their shots. " <p> If there is a bright side, Drew did step in to the starting lineup and produce when Francis was out with a strained knee. There is no chance - barring injuries - that the Rockets will make him a starter to make him more productive. But Drew said his consecutive 20-point games as a starter gave him confidence he can use when things are difficult. <p> Rap attack - While Steve Francis ' talents on the court might be obvious, he has skills off the court that have little to do with his game. <p> With a brief impromptu rap last week( some lines are already a touch out of date), he showed he can sing, offering this : <p> " Yo, let me take the mike and let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't scored double-digits in 10 months. I turn the ball over so much, I passed to Cato, he 's fumbling the ball, Carlos ca n't make a layup, y'all. Walt 's my man, Walt 's the ace. He shoots the 3, but he wo n't pass the ball back to me. " <p> Francis said he could have gone on, especially to add a few lines about Cuttino Mobley. But Mobley was not around, and it would be wrong to rap behind somebody 's back.
