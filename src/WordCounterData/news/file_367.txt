3062441 <p> I share the concerns about the Cook County Forest Preserve District( " Forest Preserves lost in the woods, " editorial, March 2). After alerting the Forest Preserve District board, the business community and the public to the district 's financial difficulties, I directed a top-to-bottom review of operations and asked Commissioner Gregg Goslin( R-Glenview) to work with civic and community leaders on operation and revenue issues. <p> The deficit spending traces back to the 1980s and, in fact, I put into effect a deficit-reduction plan in 1995. Had it been carefully followed, the district 's finances might be in better shape today. It was not, and changes are under way. To be sure, spending cuts and job reductions will be made as needed. But a work force of 1,150, responsible for managing 67,790 acres of land, falls short of your characterization as a bloated payroll. <p> Privatization, sponsorship and advertising are parts of the Forest Preserves District 's operations now and will play a larger role in the future. Today, a company provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revenues from advertising. Private contractors also remove damaged trees, operate horse stables and provide golf carts -- again, with the district sharing revenues. Sponsors help cover a range of expenses. <p> Where privatization and intergovernmental agreements can help, we will pursue those avenues. Years ago, my suggestion to make wider use of sheriff 's patrols and a ranger system in the forest preserves was viewed as less economical. But a fresh look may indicate new opportunities to improve police operations and save money. <p> Take a look at the mission statements for the forest preserves and the Chicago Park District and you will see a distinct contrast. The city 's effort is to serve as a " leading provider of recreation and leisure opportunities, " while the county 's focus is " to acquire, restore and manage lands for the purpose of protecting open space. " To date, we have acquired and are managing 91 percent of the 75,000 acres the Legislature has authorized. Golf and swimming are but a small portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years. <p> John H. Stroger Jr., president, <p> Cook County Board of Commissioners <p> Reaching out to kids <p> Illinois is now a national leader in helping low-income children obtain health insurance. The majority of the increase in the number of insured kids is due to the state 's extremely successful efforts to enroll children and pregnant mothers into its KidCare program since 1999. Unfortunately, a key point about the outreach campaign was excluded from the Sun-Times news story on March 5. <p> To meet our goal of increasing the number of pregnant mothers and children receiving health benefits, KidCare has used a strategy promoting the program, then providing detailed technical assistance in applying. <p> The promotional strategy explains the KidCare program, and tells families how to apply. To do this, we identified well-established Illinois groups with built-in networks of low-income families that likely would be eligible for KidCare. The Chicago Public Schools, Cook County Hospital and Rainbow PUSH are among the groups we enlisted to promote KidCare and encourage families to call our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts, enrollment has grown by 37,000. Its work has been instrumental. Following up on the promotional effort, we also provide assistance to families through the enrollment process. <p> Calls to our hotline have reached record levels, and we are receiving six times the number of applications than before. <p> The bottom line is KidCare is a tremendous success and continues to achieve the goal of insuring more children and pregnant women. In only two years, our enrollment has increased more than fivefold : from 29,000 to 147,000. <p> Jackie Garner, director, <p> Illinois Department <p> of Public Aid <p> Foot-in-mouth disease <p> Fraternal Order of Police President William Nolan must have himself confused with the sheriff of Dodge City, judging by his statements after the acquittal of Jeremiah Mearday. Nolan said, " Mearday will get what he deserves " and " the best thing for Mr. Mearday to do is move out of Chicago. " <p> No doubt such statements will prove valuable to defense attorneys the next time Mearday, or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However, open threats against citizens by a representative of the Chicago police just reinforce the negative image of the police. In doing so, Nolan performs a disservice to every decent police officer in the city. <p> Michael L. Needham, Palatine <p> Not an image builder <p> William Nolan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, needs to realize that the snide remarks he made after the acquittal of Jeremiah Mearday are not going to make the public sympathetic to the Police Department 's cause. If anything, it exemplifies what the defense had been saying all along. <p> Not all cops are bad. However, the Police Department needs to recognize that some officers are a bit too reckless -- which is neither in the public 's best interest nor theirs. It 's simply a matter of recognizing that no one -- cops included -- is above the law. <p> C.E. Ross, West Ridge <p> Cleaner and greener <p> With serious problems of energy shortages, pollution and global warming, should n't we use our budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmills and solar devices and for energy efficiency? <p> The potential for efficiency is demonstrated in Western Europe, where per capita energy use is far less. We could emulate Europe 's extensive and efficient mass transit systems, including high-speed, intercity trains. <p> The transition to clean energy and greater efficiency in appliances, cars and elsewhere would be costly, but would be an investment offset by even greater savings in fuel costs, according to a study by Union of Concerned Scientists. This transition would reduce dependence on foreign oil and the need for a costly military presence in the Middle East. <p> Is n't it finally time to dramatically increase energy availability in ways that do not harm human health and the environment? <p> Richard Barsanti, <p> Western Springs <p> Suffering in oblivion <p> Another innocent child has died in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services. Allen Kalfus died a terrible death, allegedly at the hand of a foster parent who had been accused of inappropriately punishing him the year before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home( news story, Feb. 25). <p> There will be the usual head-shaking and cries of " poor baby, " and maybe an editorial or two about DCFS needing reforms. This will go on for a few days, then everybody will forget until the next child dies. <p> Where is the outrage? When 80 percent of the children in DCFS care are African American, where is the outrage in our community? <p> DCFS spends more than $ 1.3 billion of our tax money, yet children in foster care continue to be abused. We just do n't hear about them until an Allen Kalfus or a William Jackson III( news story, Sept. 13) dies or is permanently disabled. Where is the sustained outrage that leads to decisive changes? <p> Pamela J. Johnson, <p> South Shore <p> It pays to be powerful <p> I have been following the controversy over President Bill Clinton 's pardon of Marc Rich, and most people are shocked that a man who blatantly violated our laws and evaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we are not focusing on is the problem with the system that made this possible. <p> The power of presidential pardon by its nature is open to abuse. It allows politics to circumvent laws, checks and balances. Richard Nixon was pardoned even though he persistently defied and stonewalled the people 's legally elected legislators. Oliver North and Caspar Weinberger were pardoned after it was proven that they had refused to obey laws enacted by Congress and had even sold arms to a terrorist state. <p> The pardon power allows politically important people to disobey our laws and defy our legislators, knowing full well that there will be no punishment. <p> To focus on Clinton is to act as if this does n't happen. It seems obvious that this " escape hatch " was purposely built into the Constitution to allow the powerful to continue to do what they fully intend to do. <p> Sister Regina Gniot, Aurora <p> Involuntary refugees <p> Your editorial( " Arafat 's violence at root of misery, " March 1) says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned by Arab rulers to leave temporarily.... As a result, the Palestinians were left with no homes to return to. " Can you document this statement? <p> Jews for Justice in the Middle East, in their booklet " The Origin of the Palestine-Israel Conflict, " cite the work of British researcher Erskine Childers who, after examining all Arab broadcasts during 1948( monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation and on file at the British Museum), found no record of any order or appeal for Arabs to evacuate Palestine. On the contrary, the civilians of Palestine were repeatedly asked and even ordered to stay put. <p> The real reason why the Palestinians fled Israel was because the Israeli armies forced them to leave, and because they feared for their lives. Under what principle of international law do civilians who flee a war zone, for whatever reason, forfeit their most basic human and property rights? <p> Thomas Williamson, <p> McKinley Park <p> Toy soldiers <p> The government is looking to court-martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank the Japanese fishing boat, when it should be in a federal court trying the congressmen and senators who make it possible for civilians to play soldier and sailor for contributions to their campaign coffers. If you " belly up "( donate), you can fly with the Blue Angels, skydive out of military planes, be a submariner and sail on an aircraft carrier. There 's something for every pocket and taste. You can rest assured that civilians were not on the submarine at the behest of the commander. <p> If civilians feel compelled to play soldier, they should walk to the corner and see the local recruiter. The Reserves and National Guard also can furnish weekend fun. <p> Oreste J. " Rusty " Florence, <p> Lombard <p> N. Siders prefer nuts <p> I see that the White Sox starting pitcher, Cal Eldred, has a 5-inch screw in his pitching arm. A lot of people might consider that unusual. I do n't. <p> After all, think of all the White Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are loose. <p> William E. Carsley, <p> Lincoln Park
