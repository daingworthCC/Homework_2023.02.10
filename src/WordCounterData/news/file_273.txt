3048441 <p> ' FORGIVENESS ' FOR A SERIAL KILLER <p> Editor -- If there is anything sadder than the savage killings of the 14 boys William Bonin raped and murdered, then surely it 's the tragically mistaken belief by some victims ' families that witnessing his execution will speed their healing( " Death of a Serial Killer, " Chronicle, February 19). <p> Given their shattering grief, it 's understandable they would confuse healing with revenge. But they will never find true healing by calling for one more murder. Murder victims ' families face a challenge most of us are mercifully spared. While hatred threatens their own humanity, and consumed by bitterness and sorrow, their only hope for true peace and healing lies in what must seem to them the impossibility of forgiveness. <p> But groups like Murder Victims ' Families for Reconciliation teach us it 's possible to return from the depths of agonizing despair, transformed by grief, the rage for revenge conquered by compassion. They return deeply wounded, but with their humanity intact, and with a plea for life. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book, " Dead Man Walking. " " Forgiveness is never going to be easy. Each day it must be prayed for and struggled for and won. " <p> MICHAEL D. McGUIRE <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> KILLER 'S TRUE NATURE <p> Editor -- I take great exception to The Chronicle 's page one story concerning the pending execution of " Freeway Killer " William Bonin( " Boys ' Killer Led a Twisted, Tortured Life, " February 19). I run a business that sells and trades autographs, including those of criminals. I worked with Bonin for a period of several months, and can state from experience that he is neither " a gifted artist and writer " nor is he possessed with " a very basic sense of caring for human beings, " as portrayed by his " biographer " Alexis Skriloff. <p> Over the years, Bill Bonin has produced a line of color pencil drawings, novels and short stories. I handled his work. The best that can be said about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines. The most that can be said about his writing is that it 's printed on paper. <p> I can understand the various last ditch attempts to save Bonin 's life, from the absurd bid for clemency, to the offensive suggestion that he be understood for his crimes -- given his pathetic childhood. But Bonin 's defense lawyers are hiding the true nature of the killer. I corresponded with Bill for a period of two years. He is openly hostile, paranoid, and, despite the imaginative utterences of Miss Skriloff, completely devoid of intelligence. As for his supposedly " caring nature, " Bonin is known to speak openly of his sexual fantasies, which, to this day, involve the rape and murder of young boys. <p> KREGG SANDERS <p> Danville, Ill. <p>. <p> HOW TO EVADE GANGS <p> Editor -- With " druggies " and youth gangs getting headlines and attention rather than punishment or deportation, it 's important we do n't forget to give credit to the vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Recently attending high school wrestling matches and an Eagle Scout Court of Honor has reminded me how these endeavors and advisers teach young people so much about hard work, responsibility, character and skills that will help them to succeed as adults. <p> If " society " punished gang- oriented youth more rather than coddling, and if it did more promotion and rewarding of scouting, church activities and youth sports, there 'd be fewer gangs, more successes, and we 'd all be much the better for it. <p> PETER A. LAURENCE <p> Clayton <p>. <p> COMMENTS ON CYPRUS <p> Editor -- Christopher Hines ' report on Cyprus( Chronicle, February 12) is welcomed in that it focuses attention on a much neglected international conflict that has finally commanded the attention of the U.S. president. But it is also disappointing because of factual errors, lack of proper historical perspective and misleading assertions. <p> Nearly 40 percent of the sovereign territory of the Republic of Cyprus has been under illegal military occupation by Turkey since 1974 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Time and again the Turkish side has frustrated the efforts of the international community to end the illegal division of Cyprus that Turkey has imposed by force of arms since 1974. This has prompted the U.N. secretary general to report that " the Security Council finds itself faced with an already familiar scenario : the absence of agreement due essentially to a lack of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side " and to warn that " the attitude adopted by the Turkish Cypriot leadership will certainly bring with it grave consequences for the well- being of the Turkish Cypriot community. " <p> A comprehensive proposal for the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus( contingent on the withdrawal of the Turkish occupation forces) was submitted to the U.N. in 1993 by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, to break " the counterproductive climate of fear and mistrust and thus enhance the prospects of a negotiated settlement. " <p> Unfortunately, Turkey has refused to even consider demilitari zation of Cyprus, and instead continues to build up its occupation forces making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most highly militarized areas in the world, " according to the U.N. secretary general. <p> The Cyprus government remains committed to reaching a negotiated settlement based on the parameters set by relevant U.N. resolutions, and the prospects for a negotiated settlement will be greatly enhanced if the Turkish side accepts Security Council Resolution 939 of July 1994, which reaffirms those principles. <p> Regarding the alleged money laundering, the charge is unfair and the answer of the Cypriot officials has been clear : " We do our best to apply the law and we believe we do so effectively. But if you have evidence in specific cases showing otherwise, let us know and we shall put it right. " <p> Finally, the map of Cyprus accompanying your report is misleading. Those areas of the island that are under Turkish military occupation( labeled " Turkey ") remain a part of the Republic of Cyprus, and the division imposed by Turkey 's aggression should not obscure this fact. <p> ANASTASIOS K. SIMONIDIS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> ROOT OUT BIG MONEY <p> Editor -- In an election year offering some hotly contested seats, your article regarding term limits and the " legislative scramble " caused by its effect( Chronicle, February 15) gives a coherent structure to what looks to be a whirlaway ride. <p> Of particular interest are the comments made by voter Christopher Cherney of Oakland. Deriding term limits as another coat of paint on a crusty old house, he peers deeper into the morass( " We need to restructure the way money flows into campaigns...) and sets his sights on the bigger picture : special-interest money in politics. By having candidates, and ultimately representatives, more beholden to special interests than to the simple voter, how can we be assured that our voices are being heard? <p> Instead of turning the doors of our Assembly and Senate into a turnstile chronicling the passing of one corruption into the hands of another, we have a chance to root out the influence that causes the mass of cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics. Then we can talk reform. <p> NEIL J.
