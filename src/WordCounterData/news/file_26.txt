3004241 <p> If President Bush 's vision of the future of American schools has a shape, it is beginning to emerge in Memphis. <p> Memphis was the first major city to answer President Bush 's call to become an " America 2000 " community by drawing up a plan to fix its schools. Slowly and laboriously, parents, educators, business leaders and civil rights advocates are working to build sturdy coalitions for change. To win agreement, they have already had to jettison one of Mr. Bush 's key planks -- public money for private schools -- and add several different goals to make Mr. Bush 's plan their own. <p> How Memphis and the thousand or so other communities that so far have embraced the America 2000 challenge fare may help gauge whether the President 's education strategy will inspire other Americans to improve their schools or will end as a futile public relations exercise. <p> With its high poverty and welfare-dependency rates and students who fall below national averages on test scores, Memphis mirrors the problems of urban school districts across the country. <p> " The reason Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this might work, " said Ron Register, an urban anthropologist who heads a task force on parental involvement, one of eight task forces examining different educational problems with the aim of producing an education plan for Memphis schools by next fall. Problems at the Start <p> Although the campaign, dubbed " Memphis 2000, " was only begun in July, its organizers have already had to confront several sensitive issues : how to involve both blacks and whites in a city with its share of racial tensions, how to counter the perception that this is a white Republican effort that offers high-sounding ideals but no money, and how to win agreement from people with different ideas of what is wrong with schools and how to change them. <p> The problems facing Memphis are stark -- and like many cities, social and economic ills are enmeshed with educational ones. Memphis has the highest percentage of people living in poverty and on welfare among cities with populations of more than 500,000, according to the Mayors of Memphis and neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 36th percentile in reading and the 40th percentile in mathematics nationwide. Spending per pupil is $3,568, well below the national average of $5,237. <p> White parents have largely fled the public schools, leaving them 80 percent black, and, Memphis civil rights leaders say, even more vulnerable to budget cuts as a result. A growing number of taxpayers are elderly people on fixed incomes who regularly vote against more money for schools. <p> " Their sense is kids over there are drinking, smoking, sniffing and having sex, and are not interested in learning, " said William N. Morris Jr., Mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis and provides much of the financing for the city 's schools. Met His Old Boss <p> Memphis 's latest attempt to tackle these problems began last April when Bill Gibbons, a prominent local lawyer, ran into his former boss, Lamar Alexander, now the United States Secretary of Education. When Mr. Alexander was Governor of Tennessee in the late 1970 's and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge Memphis jobs conference that helped revitalize the city economically, the way Mr. Alexander hopes America 2000 communities will revive American education. President Bush had just unveiled an education strategy that relied largely on local efforts, and Mr. Alexander suggested that Memphis join in. <p> Drawing on past experience with community organizing, Mr. Gibbons and other Memphis leaders set out to defuse possible political and racial tensions by seeking wide participation and adapting the goals of America 2000 to Memphis 's needs and politics. <p> Mr. Gibbons, a Republican, recruited as co-leaders of Memphis 2000 a white businesswoman, Nancy E. Bogatin, an outspoken Democrat, and a black lawyer, Allan Wade, who is a political independent. They persuaded six Memphis businesses to donate $25,000 each and established a timetable. On July 23, Mr. Alexander flew to Memphis for an elaborate press conference on Memphis 2000. <p> But many remained skeptical, even hostile. " I think it was politically motivated that Memphis was the first site, " said Willie Herenton, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schools for 12 years. " I was then running for Mayor against a Republican incumbent. Everyone on that podium was all white, all male, and here Memphis is an 80 percent black school system. I saw it as a political farce which I was not going to endorse. " Local Goals Added <p> Continuing suspicion among educators as well as local politicians prodded Memphis 2000 's organizers to try to differentiate their effort from America 2000. Memphis added two local goals -- eliminating gaps in educational opportunities among children and fostering parental involvement -- to the six national education goals America 2000 communities are supposed to adopt. <p> These six goals include insuring that all students are healthy and intellectually stimulated enough to start school and that they leave school competent in five basic subjects, raising the high school graduation rate to 90 percent, making American students lead the world in mathematics and science, erasing adult illiteracy and making schools safe and drug-free. <p> To win over educators like Elsie Lewis Bailey, principal of Booker T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not endorse a crucial plank of the Bush platform -- school " choice " for private schools, a voucher-like program in which money could follow students to whatever school they chose, public or private. <p> These efforts mollified several people, including Mayor Herenton. " I 'm willing to work with them as long as I can be convinced it is not business as usual, a public relations approach to addressing education reform where nothing happens, " the Mayor said. <p> On Oct. 23, Memphis 2000 's leaders convened a citywide educational symposium that drew more than 750 people. Now, in school-district office basements and public libraries, the task forces are embarking on the sometimes frustrating, sometimes electric process of defining what is wrong in Memphis and what to do about it. <p> The other night, three task forces with about 40 people each met and filled the walls of their meeting rooms with lists of problems. " Lack of real( proper) role models " and " too many students per teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalizing educational opportunities. Trying to Be Honest <p> Amid the unavoidable tedium, however, flashes of emotion broke through, as members of the racially mixed panels struggled to talk honestly about sensitive issues. <p> " We are so diverse, and people are shy about saying what they really feel about children of another race, " said Carole Hall Hardeman, dean of the faculty at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. <p> The participants in Mr. Register 's task force on parental involvement spent much of the evening talking about the parents who were not there -- poor black parents -- and how to reach them. They plan to move the meetings to churches or housing projects, away from what Mr. Register called " white middle-class settings " where many parents may not feel comfortable. <p> Indeed, many blacks remain wary. " I talk to black kids and they say, that 's some white honky middle-class deal, " said Mr. Wade, the black lawyer who is a co-chairman of Memphis 2000. " You 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something. ' " <p> The challenge for Memphis 2000 is to synthesize these diverse views into a coherent plan. Ask different people in Memphis and they give different reasons why the schools are struggling and offer different wish lists. <p> Johnnie B. Watson, Deputy Superintendent of Schools, wants better early childhood education, and more money for smaller classes and alternative schools for disruptive children. Stephanie Rodda, one of the few white parents who chose to enroll her children in public schools, believes the word has not gotten out that some of Memphis 's 158 schools are good. <p> Janet Robbins, a fourth-grade teacher at Mrs. Rodda 's children 's school who is sharing a classroom with another teacher and 50 children while new classrooms are being built, says she needs parental involvement and community support even more than new buildings. <p> Mrs. Bailey, the high school principal, talks of students who stay home to take care of baby siblings because their mothers are on drugs, of poor academic skills and low motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go after school. Is Racism the Problem? <p> For Maxine Smith, the new president of the Memphis school board and the executive director of the Memphis branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the same sickness afflicts both Memphis and its schools. " Memphis is a very racist city, " she said. " This is a neglected, underfunded system. <p> " We need early childhood and prenatal programs, " she continued. " We 've got to get parents involved. Over 70 of all black babies here are born to single parents. We have to address the needs of a deprived -- which has become a depraved -- population. I wo n't shy away from that. I think Memphis 2000 has the will to get it done. " <p> But many of these efforts will cost money, another potentially divisive issue for Memphis 2000. Gov. Ned McWherter, a Democrat, has just proposed an income tax to finance education, and state legislators have fallen all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly endorse it ; others do not. <p> " The initial reaction to us was, ' A lot of talk and not much money, ' " Mr. Gibbons said. " But we 're never going to get any more money until we have an understandable plan in place that the public supports. " <p> That task lies ahead, but Mr. Register believes Memphis 2000 has more chance of success than any previous effort, partly because the process crafted to develop the plan includes so many diverse voices, and partly because Memphis itself is changing. The city now has its first black Mayor, a new school board, a largely new City Council, and a new superintendent of schools starting this summer. <p> " If it does not happen now, when does it happen? " Mr. Register said. <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 17, 1992, Friday <p> CORRECTION : An Education page picture caption on Wednesday about efforts to improve Memphis 's schools misidentified the women shown.
