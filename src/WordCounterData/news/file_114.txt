3022741 <p> President Clinton 's administration dispatched unusually large groups of Americans as official witnesses to two recent major overseas events : South African President Nelson Mandela 's inauguration and the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accord. <p> In both cases the White House increased by several times the typical delegation size, which is generally fewer than 10 people. <p> One extra military jet was arranged to ferry the emissaries to the historic events. <p> The large delegations were deemed appropriate because " the overall significance of both events was so unusual and has so much history involved, " said Fred DuVal, deputy chief of protocol at the State Department. <p> For this week 's Mandela inauguration, the 44-member delegation was among the largest in memory and was loaded with stature. Not only did Vice President Al Gore go, but the delegation included Clinton 's and Gore 's wives. <p> The May 3-5 Cairo trip to witness Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin launch Palestinian self-rule included 35 Arab-American and Jewish activists and business people, in addition to Secretary of State Warren Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign funeral or inauguration is five to 10 people usually a mix of government representatives, members of Congress and presidential friends. <p> The government pays air fare and hotel bills. Because the trips tend to be short, most cost the State Department less than dlrs 10,000, in addition to Defense Department costs if a military jet is used, DuVal said. <p> This week 's South Africa trip is expected to carry a price tag of at least dlrs 20,000, not including the Pentagon 's costs for the extra Boeing 707, he said. <p> The State Department budgets about dlrs 400,000 a year for delegations. <p> The Pentagon supplied dlrs 10,000-an-hour 707 jetliners to carry the Cairo and South Africa delegations. Such costs are considered part of the budget that would be spent anyway for training hours, according to Air Force Maj. Bruce Gillman. <p> When the delegation is organized it helps to be a friend of the president with some business or other tie to the country involved. <p> " You want people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue is at hand. You want people who have been supportive of the administration, " said Amy Zisook, special assistant to the president in the White House public liaison office, who helped assemble the Cairo delegation. <p> The South Africa trip drew heavy lobbying as people long involved in the anti-apartheid fight sought the opportunity to see the climax of their efforts. <p> " Our phone was ringing off the hook, " said Steve Hilton, deputy assistant to the president. " But with only so many slots, we wanted to take care of those who had been intimately involved in the fight against apartheid for so many years. " <p> Among those selected were Jesse Jackson ; entertainer Quincy Jones ; several Congressional Black Caucus members ; Coretta Scott King, the widow of the REv. Martin Luther King Jr. ; former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell and Benjamin Chavis, director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. <p> A group of lawmakers not chosen took another Pentagon jet and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cairo trip, with Christopher 's entourage already in the Middle East, the White House filled an Air Force jet with mostly business people and Arab and Jewish activists, including Miles Lerman, head of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Linda Heller Kamm of Americans for Peace Now and former Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar. <p> With only a few days notice of the signing, officials asked former Congressman Mel Levine and Arab American Institute director Jim Zogby to suggest delegation members from an Arab-Jewish cooperation group they head called Builders for Peace. <p> " It was a marvelous experience on the plane, " said Zogby. " A lot of things got passed back and forth, " by delegation members looking for ways to work on future economic expansion projects in the region. <p> As state occasions go, Nelson Mandela 's inauguration and the signing of the Israel-Palestinian accord ranked with the biggest, and the United States sent delegations of commensurate size and stature. <p> In both cases the White House departed from the typical practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instead dispatched a planeload of emissaries. <p> The unusual size of the delegations was deemed appropriate because " the overall significance of both events was so unusual and has so much histoy involved, " said Fred DuVal, deputy chief of protocol at the State Department. <p> The 44-member delegation to Pretoria this week ranked among the largest in memory. It was headed by Vice President Al Gore and included his wife, Tipper, and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. <p> The May 3-5 Cairo trip to witness Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin launch Palestinian self-rule included 35 Arab-American and Jewish activists and business people, in addition to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his key aides. <p> Most delegations to foreign funerals, inaugurations and the like include five to 10 people usually a mix of government representatives, members of Congress and presidential friends. <p> Expenses, chiefly air fare and hotel bills, are picked up by the government. Because the trips tend to be short, most cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pentagon 's costs if a military jet is used, DuVal said. <p> The South Africa trip by contrast is expected to carry a price tag of at least dlrs 20,000, not including the Pentagon 's costs for the extra Boeing 707, he said. <p> The State Department budgets about dlrs 400,000 a year for delegations. <p> On the rare occasions when an extra plane is needed to accommodate larger groups, the Pentagon picks up the bill dlrs 10,000 an hour for the Boeing 707 that carried the Cairo and South Africa delegations. The cost is considered part of the budget that would be spent anyway for training hours, according to Air Force Maj. Bruce Gillman. <p> When the delegation is put together, it helps to be a friend of the president with some business or other tie to the country involved. <p> " You want people who have an interest who have worked on behalf of whatever the issue is at hand. You want people who have been supportive of the administration, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House Public Liaison office, who helped put together the Cairo trip. <p> The clamor to go to the long-awaited South African inauguration was intense. <p> " Our phone was ringing off the hook, " said Steve Hilton, deputy director of the White House liaison office. <p> A rump group of Congress members who were not members of the delegation commandeered another Pentagon jet and went to the inauguration on their own. <p> In the case of the Cairo trip, with Christopher and his plane already in the Middle East, the White House filled an Air Force jet with mostly business people and Arab and Jewish activists. <p> With only three days ' advance notice of the signing, former Rep. Mel Levine and Arab American Institute director Jim Zogby were tapped to suggest members of an Arab-Jewish cooperation group they head called Builders for Peace.
