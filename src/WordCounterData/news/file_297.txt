3051341 <p> Three decades ago, West Contra Costa Unified School District officials and their employees struck a bargain. In exchange for accepting lower salaries, employees and their spouses would receive health coverage, paid in full by the district, for the rest of their lives. Today, the district 's 35,000 schoolchildren are paying the price. The extension of fully funded health coverage to employees ' retirement years will cost the district $9.5 million this year. For some, that seems a high price given the prospect of shuttered libraries, no high school sports or guidance counselors in the fall. Fewer than a dozen of California 's 1,000 school districts offer such a generous retirement package. To people who make their living scouring the books of ailing school districts, it is n't hard to figure out why. West Contra Costa officials project that by next year, health care costs will jump 15 to 20 percent. By 2010, the district will be spending more than $12 million annually on health benefits for people who no longer work there. Actuaries say that even if the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the hook for $275 million, and the district has no money set aside to pay for it. " Obviously, no one can afford it, " said Joel Montero, who has audited the district for the state 's Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, which has been urging the district to tackle the issue for years. " It 's a big deal. " The soaring costs of health care -- whether for the district 's 1,814 retirees, or its 2,631 employees -- is one of the most glaring reasons why the school system was forced to slash $16.5 million from its budget for the 2004-05 school year. The cuts followed voters ' defeat of a parcel tax two weeks ago that would have generated $7.5 million annually. From the lasting legacy of the district 's near-bankruptcy in 1991, to a costly bargain over retiree health care, to countless other decisions made by school boards and administrators through the ages, the cuts of today are intertwined with the district 's history. " The present generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had to bear so much of the burden of past follies. " There are many things officials point to when asked why West Contra Costa 's schools are in such dire financial straits. Some are problems common to all schools across the state, such as state cuts that have left all of Contra Costa 's schools with a total of $200 million less than they received two years ago, said the county school Superintendent Joseph Ovitz. Like half of the school districts across the state, West Contra Costa 's bottom line is being hit by declining enrollment -- a projected 800-student decline in the fall means $4.8 million less in funding. Also, spiraling special education costs in urban school districts will force West Contra Costa to spend an additional $1 million next year. But those factors alone would not have been enough to force the district -- which serves children in Richmond, El Cerrito, Kensington, El Sobrante, Hercules, Pinole and San Pablo -- to make the dramatic $16.5 million in cuts to its $180 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant superintendent for fiscal services, say it is unfair that their district receives lower than average per pupil funding from the state. Those payments were set by the state after the passage of Proposition 13 using a complex formula which took into account population and home values at the time. She points out the disparity between their district, which receives $4,691 per student from the state, and others in the East Bay. Orinda has the lowest per pupil funding at $4,399 per student, while Dublin gets $5,617, the most generous of any district in the East Bay. " If we had Dublin 's revenue limit, we would get $31 million more in this district annually, " Vedovelli said, more than enough to restore all of last week 's cuts. Still, any story about the West Contra Costa 's finances is a tale of how decisions made by previous administrations affect future generations. Nowhere is that more clear than in the $1.8 million the district spends each year to pay back a state bailout loan after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district to the brink of insolvency 13 years ago. " It 's a burden that really unfairly handicaps our students, " said trustee Glen Price. " And there 's some lingering mistrust in the community 's relationship to the district. " Marks was hired in 1987 in an attempt to shake up a district known for low test scores and a high dropout rate. He poured money into magnet schools and hired new teachers, winning accolades from the first Bush administration. But in the 1990-91 school year, the district 's financial house of cards came tumbling down. The district filed for bankruptcy, and the state took over, giving the district a $29 million bailout loan. Most of Marks ' programs were scrapped, about 400 teachers were laid off, and those who remained took a 9 percent pay cut. Though it refinanced the loan several years ago, today the district is still paying it back at an interest rate of 5.7 percent, said Bob Blattner, of the Sacramento-based School Services of California, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rate of the Oakland schools ' bailout loan is 1.8 percent. Last year, Blattner said, Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill that allows the state to refinance the district 's debt again, potentially saving the district up to $600,000 a year. But the bill took effect after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger took office, and his administration -- dealing with its own budget woes -- " has clearly said no " to refinancing, Blattner said. In recent years, the district has turned to the public for help with lingering financial issues. In 1998, voters approved a $40 million bond measure to make repairs and build a new middle school. In 2000 and 2002, voters approved $450 million more in school construction bonds. The funds allowed the district to build the gleaming new Lovonya DeJean Middle School in Richmond, and to replace sagging roofs, repave playgrounds and make other repairs at schools. But some parents complained that the district was slow to spend the money and did not produce enough. When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $450 million school bond, voters failed to support it. Two weeks ago, they rejected the parcel tax. Cathy Garza is angry that the measure failed. Garza, whose fourth-grade daughter Taylor attends Kensington Hilltop elementary school, said the school board ca n't be blamed for making the hard cuts since voters failed to help. " The voters here did n't step up to the plate and pass a very lightweight tax. If we ca n't even do that, we ca n't expect to have everything we want, " Garza said. " I hate being the first in the state to declare bankruptcy, and to be the first in the state to give up sports and our libraries. " But parent Kevin Rivard of Richmond does not trust the district to spend the money where it will benefit their children most. " I refuse to give them money until they show me they will spend the money they currently have wisely, " said Rivard, who campaigned against the parcel tax. Like government auditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the looming problem that paying the full cost of employee 's health benefits -- especially lifetime benefits for retired workers and their dependents -- will pose down the road. " It 's the big elephant in the room. Nobody wants to see it, but they smell the stink, " Rivard said. This year, the district paid more than $30 million for employee benefits, $21 million for current employees and $9.5 million for retirees. The total was $5 million more than last year. Insurance costs continue to escalate, jumping 23 percent in 2003, and 18 percent in 2004, said assistant superintendent Pat McWilliams. Since the district does not require its employees to share the cost of insurance premiums, the district bears the full brunt of the increases. West Contra Costa stands with just a handful of other districts -- among them San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Fresno -- in covering lifetime health benefits for retirees and their dependents. Half the districts in the state do n't cover any health benefits for retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit typically do it until a retiree turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare. Union and district officials in West Contra Costa say the bargain was struck in the 1970s, when realignment of school financing and the passage of Prop. 13 caused funding to drop dramatically. Woody Snodgrass, a former superintendent who served for years on the school board, reportedly negotiated the deal with the unions in exchange for keeping salaries low. At the time, health care costs were nominal, and California teachers did not count on receiving Medicare coverage because they did not " pay into the system " like they do today. Terri Jackson, president of United Teachers of Richmond, which represents teachers, counselors, librarians and others, said employees have sacrificed decades of higher salaries in exchange for lifetime benefits, including staying with the district when their pay was slashed by 9 percent in 1991. Today, teachers ' earnings max out at $65,000, lower than most other East Bay districts. That also means West Contra Costa retirees get lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highest salary. " Teachers have choices and they can go anywhere. The benefits are the attractive thing here, " Jackson said. " There are people who stuck around here for that purpose only. " Other union leaders, like Kathy Rollins of Public Employees Union Local 1 -- which represents clerks, custodians and the district 's blue collar workers -- say administrators should not ask employees to sacrifice benefits until they sacrifice too, especially since the unions deferred a 2 percent raise last year. The superintendent earns $191,000 a year plus a generous car and housing allowance, she said. Retired counselor Al Kirkland, 71, who left DeAnza High in 1986, said he does n't feel conflicted that the district pays the cost of health care for him and his wife. " I did n't miss a day for 30 years. The retirees have a contract that can not be broken, " he said. Kirkland volunteers for the district, coaching the tennis team at Pinole Valley High. " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One school district that had lifetime benefits for its employees -- Orange Unified School District in Orange County -- decided in 1991 to stop giving the benefit to new employees, while keeping the benefit for anyone hired before 1991. In 1995, the state began to require districts to use actuaries to calculate their " unfunded liability " for retiree benefits, the amount of money they are committed to spending that they do not have money set aside for. Government auditors like Montero have also raised the issue for years, warning in their last report, published in July 2003, that " this practice is costing the district dearly. " Superintendent Gloria Johnston said the issue was raised during the last round of contract negotiations, and that she expects it will be brought up when the teachers ' contract expires in 2005. Ron Bennett, president of School Services of California, said school boards have few incentives to negotiate the benefit with unions. They would likely anger the union and create a two-tiered system for employees that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not generate any savings in your lifetime, " Bennett said. In Orange, for example, the district has faced lawsuits, and still has n't realized new savings even though they acted 13 years ago. Board President Charles Ramsey said " everything " will be on the table " including a realignment of administrative salaries. " But he said the district 's employees have " given a lot of years at low salaries. " " To me, health care benefits are key, and why would I want to do away with something I believe in? It ca n't always be a race to the bottom, " he said. " I 'd love to see more districts have health care and benefits for their employees. " The bigger issue is, ' Are we receiving enough money from the state of California? ' " he said. " We need to try to ensure that we do n't lose sight of the bigger picture.
