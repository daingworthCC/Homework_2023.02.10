3059141 <p> I f there 's a name that opens doors in America, it 's Kennedy. <p> And Christopher G. Kennedy, the eighth of Robert F. and Ethel Kennedy 's 11 children, wants to walk through them on his own power. <p> Since arriving in Chicago in 1987 as the Kennedy being groomed to oversee the family-owned Merchandise Mart complex, he has formed long-lasting friendships while building his role in the community. Still, his life is much less in the limelight than may have been imagined when his 1987 marriage to Winnetka native Sheila Berner drew hundreds of uninvited guests. <p> Kennedy likes it that way. At 30, he is more experienced at life than most, out of necessity. It is the reason his opinion is so valued among his contemporaries, as well as his family. <p> " He has a lot more maturity, wisdom and perspective on issues than his chronological age, " said Mike Mulqueen, executive director of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, where Kennedy volunteers. " Maybe that 's the breeding. " <p> Kennedy shrugs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my judgment 's so good, but I guess my judgment developed early on, " Kennedy said, a touch of the typical Kennedy inflection creeping into his voice. " If you grow up in a household that 's as big as ours, with so many people around, everybody bringing friends home, you become a fairly quick judge of character. <p> " I suppose one of the attributes of growing up in a famous family is there 's a certain wariness that one develops early on about why somebody is around. You take stock of your friendships and your relationships with other people. " <p> That same power of analysis, along with his natural curiosity, is why Kennedy can enthusiastically explain why waves on Lake Michigan are harder to sail than the Atlantic Ocean and why the Mart should never be completely open to the public. It 's also why he regularly checks on the deteriorating health of a panhandler on the Franklin Street bridge who knows Kennedy by name. <p> Friends and family say his hearty laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality as his financial savvy and healthy sense of athletic competition. <p> " He was the kind of a kid who lit up a room, " said Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., his 41-year-old brother. " There were a lot of tough times when we were growing up, and Christopher was just buoyant. " <p> Jeff Perlee, general counsel for the Illinois Lottery, compares his relationship with Chris and Sheila to that of a more fashionable Bob and Emily Newhart with their neighbor, Howard. Perlee met the Kennedys six years ago through a mutual friend and worked at the same law firm as Sheila. <p> " The very first day I was in Chicago, it was Mother 's Day, and he called and asked if I wanted to go to a Mother 's Day picnic with his wife 's family, " Perlee remembered. " I 'm a Republican, and I do n't know if they knew that beforehand, but I 've felt like a member of the family ever since. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Kennedy has set himself apart. While his degree from Boston College in 1986 was in political science, it appears business is his passion. <p> Friends say his grandfather, Joseph P. Kennedy, is his true role model. It was he who in 1945 acquired the then-15-year-old Mart from the Marshall Field family. The Mart and the adjacent Apparel Center and ExpoCenter is the largest wholesale trade center in the United States, with 1,300 tenants occupying 7.2 million square feet. <p> " The most phenomenal thing about my grandfather was his ability to achieve a wide range of accomplishments during his lifetime and raise children who were able to do the same, " Kennedy said. " There are a lot of people who are able to accomplish a lot, but their children suffer for it. " <p> Efforts to maintain that balance are no more obvious than in his office at the Merchandise Mart, where family photos decorate one wall and the Mart 's floor plans cover the opposite wall. <p> As much as he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. An early riser, he relishes fixing breakfast for his two children, Katherine, 3 1/2, and Christopher Jr., 18 months, in their North Shore home. Talk of children and the possibility of more brings an immediate grin to the familiar-shaped face. He likens parenting to " being in love for the first time " and says Sheila, an attorney by trade who is now a full-time mom, is the linchpin who holds the family together. The couple met while both were students at Boston College. <p> At work in the Mart, he talks with several siblings each day. Since he 's the only one who 's expressed a real interest in running the family business, and is now working on his MBA, they rely on his advice, both personally and professionally. <p> The fact that Chris Kennedy went into the family business " has been a godsend to all of us, " Joe said. " The only reason any of us can afford to go into politics, human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money for all of us. " <p> His aptitude for business manifested itself early. At age 16, Kennedy and Hyannis friend Brad Blank pooled money to buy a few sailboats, hire some employees and start a rental business. Blank remembers having a fair share of arguments with his bossy partner, but the business turned a profit. <p> " I think he realized quite a while ago that he had to go another route, " said Blank, a Boston lawyer who represents several athletes, including the Chicago Bears ' Tom Waddle. " He wants to be as important as anybody in the family. " <p> Not many outsiders get much of an inkling of what it 's like to be a Kennedy, but one who has is Thomas Kennedy, also an executive vice president at the Mart but no relation to the family. <p> " There 's always a pregnant pause, and you feel the necessity to explain to people that you are n't one of them, " Thomas Kennedy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but there are times when he wished for a different history. His father, who was running for president, was assassinated one month before Chris ' fifth birthday. <p> " I did not like growing up without a father, I did not like losing a brother( David, who died from a drug overdose in 1984) while I was in college, " Kennedy stated without reservation. " Every day, I 'd like to trade those. <p> " If people expect more, I guess I 've had that expectation level since I was a little kid, " he continued. " When you have that many older brothers and <p> sisters, and all of them had very bright friends, you have to produce more. They 're all challenging you every day. The challenges I receive from other people are n't half as difficult as the ones I get from my own family. " <p> So far, his accomplishments have been well-received. He learned the Mart 's business from the bottom up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public and filling it with suppliers of bath and kitchen products. Kennedy also took a somewhat inefficient marketing department, consolidated it and made it more aggressive. <p> " We no longer see ourselves simply in the business of renting space, but really see ourselves in the business of generating leads and generating business for the showroom sales offices, " he said. <p> A lot of tenants say they do n't see Kennedy much except for chance meetings in the hallways. But they like some of the results they 've seen since he joined the Mart. <p> " Traffic in the Mart has been nothing to write home about, but the Mart has done a lot more for tenants than it used to, " said Manfred Steinfeld, whose Shelby Williams showroom has been a Mart tenant for 33 years. <p> How long Kennedy will remain in Chicago and relatively behind the scenes is anyone 's guess. As far as a political future, he says he 's undecided. <p> " Right now, he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how long that 's going to go on, " said Rep. Mel Reynolds, D-Ill., a longtime friend. " He wants to accomplish things. He wants to contribute something. " <p> But others -- including his family -- are n't so sure, and think one of the reasons Kennedy likes Chicago and the Mart is that the glare of publicity is n't as bright here as on the East Coast. <p> " In Chicago, I think people respect your privacy much more, " Kennedy explained. " It 's a town more interested in real things and accomplishments. "
