3057341 <p> MEMORIAL 'S Denene Bammel had her biggest high as a coach in 1983, when the University Interscholastic League sanctioned team tennis. <p> With the goal of winning for the school rather than just themselves, the players turned a major corner in Bammel 's eyes and really made coaching tennis an even greater joy for her. <p> " In team tennis, the kids fight for it, and it 's always exciting to start off the( school) year like that, " she said. <p> There will be a big difference in fall 2004, however. Team tennis will still be thriving at Memorial, but Bammel will not. <p> After 25 years leading the program, Bammel decided to step down this season in order to take care of her ailing mother. She informed her team before the District 21-5A tourney, but she 's still coming to grips with it herself. <p> " Tennis just takes a lot of time and I want to be able to be there for my mom if I need to be, " Bammel said. " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this is my last year. When you do something for 25 years, it 's really hard to stop, especially when you have kids who have done a good job for you. " <p> Bammel did get to savor a successful final year. In team tennis, the Mustangs reached the Region III semifinals before bowing out to region champ Katy Taylor. And she coached freshman Carolyn Simmons to a state tournament berth in girls singles this spring. <p> The fact that she did n't have to coach alone made this season special as well. In the past Bammel had an assistant coach for a season or two, but she now realizes what she 's been missing all this time. <p> When team tennis first appeared, Bammel said, she had no problem coaching her players over six courts. But when teams expanded and she had to cover nine courts, that 's when she felt the team lost some of its competitive edge. <p> Memorial went to state in team tennis in 1984, but ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third at regionals, usually finishing behind the likes of Clear Lake. <p> " It was quite a challenge all those years, " Bammel said. " I 've always coached all the matches and recorded all the scores. But I 'm learning for the first year how great having an assistant coach is. " <p> While she has n't had a lot of time to enjoy the luxury of assistance, Bammel said she 's been extremely happy with the renaissance in players ' attitudes. <p> There was a time, she said, when high school tennis players were as much prima donnas as the pros they would watch on TV. <p> " It was a hard time to control them, " she said. " You 'd watch that phase come in and you would get rid of it as soon as you could. <p> " When our kids play, they have to play the game, call the ball out or in. They do n't have officials and it 's hard to do. You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they try their best, they get upset with it sometimes, but it 's the ones who can control themselves who win in the end. " <p> Bammel has witnessed other positive changes during her 25 years at Memorial. Perhaps the most significant was the improvement in competitive tennis in Houston. <p> It used to be Bammel had to find teams in San Antonio or Corpus Christi in order to challenge the Mustangs. Part of the reason is Houston did n't have a significant number of tennis courts. <p> Bammel remembers growing up in an atmosphere when tennis was booming in popularity but the facilities could n't keep up with demand. <p> " You had to go to Memorial Park a week before you wanted to play and stand in line to get a court at 6 on Friday, " she said. " There are so many courts available now, and these kids have a great opportunity. " <p> It was an opportunity of a lifetime for Bammel when she took the Memorial job in 1979, inheriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who was the school 's first tennis coach. <p> Bammel was a student teacher under Hausinger in 1972 before leaving to take over the Lamar Consolidated Junior High program. Bammel then took 4 1/2 years off from her career to raise a family, and by the time she was ready to get back into coaching, Hausinger was retiring and offered the job to Bammel. <p> " Everything just worked perfectly, " Bammel said. " It 's really weird now that I 'm the one retiring. There are lots of people who want this job and it 's a premier opportunity for anyone who gets it. " <p> The next coach will be only the fourth tennis coach in Memorial 's history. Don Coleman coached the boys ' team for a short while early on before Hausinger took over both boys and girls. <p> " The players took( the news) pretty good, " Bammel said. " Some of my juniors were not too thrilled, but it 's always kinda tough. The freshmen are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they 'll get someone in there who will do a good job. " <p> Bammel 's departure is n't the only one in Spring Branch ISD. Northbrook coach Patrick David is moving on and Spring Woods coach Kaye Williams is looking to move into the administrative side. <p> That will leave only stalwart Rory Frazee at Stratford. <p> " It 's going to be very different. We 're going through a lot of coaching changes, " Frazee said. " I might be the last Mohican, and I 'm becoming the elder statesmen in certain respects whether I want it or not. <p> " But one thing I 'll say about Denene, she always defended her kids and always stood up for her players. She always worked hard behind the scenes to promote Spring Branch tennis. She ran a lot of tournaments and she should be congratulated in growing our sport and representing the community the way she has. She 's also had a lot of champions. <p> " I think 25 years speaks volumes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch communities. " <p> Bammel 's only desire as a coach was to pass on her passion for tennis to others. <p> " I just hope the kids have a great time playing tennis and keep it throughout their lifetime, " said Bammel, who said she plans to continue following the program from the stands and would n't rule out coming back to coaching. " I hope I 've kept the kids in the right direction as far as keeping it fun. It 's different playing for a school and it gives them a chance to support the school. " <p> <p> Simmons <p> Carolyn Simmons was like a fish out of water during the first set of her state quarterfinal tennis match. <p> The Memorial freshman was a bit timid going up against Pavi Francis of Lewisville Marcus on May 10 at the World of Tennis, Lakeway, but that changed by the second set and possibly set the stage for a strong run in 2005. <p> " It took her a little while to get going and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " said Bammel, " then she did a pretty good job of staying with her. " <p> After dropping the first set 6-3, Simmons nearly pushed the match to a third set before faltering 7-5. <p> " Early on she was just sitting back a little bit and not playing her game, " Bammel said. " She was just trying to keep the ball in play. But when Carolyn decided she wanted to attack a little bit more and make the point, she did a really good job. " <p> Francis was able to make an impression with a strong forehand, and her ball placement was impeccable, keeping Simmons back on her heels with some timely drop shots. <p> " Carolyn felt she played the best match she could this year, " Bammel said. " She really was pleased, even though she lost. She realized she could win some points on her and just lost some important shots she did n't need to lose in the second set. She was starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop shots on her. " <p> Simmons reached the state tourney by finishing second at the Region III tourney to Paloma Escobedo of Westside. Escobedo reached the 5A state final to face Francis, but the Wolves ' freshman lost in three sets 4-6, 6-3, 7-6( 7-5). Simmons and Escobedo should provide some thrilling head-to-head matchups in the coming years. <p> In the meantime, Bammel said, Simmons should continue to improve her game. <p> " She 's just started serving a little bit harder and I hope she keeps that and learns to be more aggressive on the shots and play intimidating a little bit more, " she said. " She needs to get into the shots more and place the shots where she wants and follow through with it. <p> " She has some good prospects and she 'll come back more confident. I look for her to be really good in the future. She 's ready to go again. " <p> <p> BAMMEL ACE <p> Game : Memorial tennis coach Denene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Set : Bammel says her biggest joy is watching individuals meld as a unit in fall team tennis. <p> Match : Carolyn Simmons was Bammel 's final winner, a state tournament qualifier this past spring.
