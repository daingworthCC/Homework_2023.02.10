3025641 <p> It 's been almost a daily occurrence during the past few weeks : Once again, the Japanese stock market has plunged. <p> But there 's something different this time. Investors who had belittled Japan 's troubles earlier in the month suddenly are growing cautious. After shrugging off several Tokyo plunges, the U.S. market slumped Thursday in reaction to the latest Japanese stock debacle. And analysts are talking about the long-term damage that such repeated shock waves from Tokyo could wreak on markets here and around the world. <p> The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 32.21 points( 1.2%) Thursday to 2695.72, after being down as much as 49 points earlier in the day. The U.S. decline followed a plunge of 963.85 points( 3.1%) to 29,843.34 by Tokyo 's key Nikkei index. The Nikkei had fought back from a loss of more than 1,900 points, or 6%, earlier Thursday. That brought the average 's loss for the year to 23%. <p> At Tokyo 's close Friday( 1 a.m. EST), the Nikkei was up 526.56 points( 1.75%) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether the Tokyo plunge will cause Japanese investors to buy or sell U.S. investments, helping or hurting our markets, the biggest immediate impact could be psychological. Investors hate uncertainty - and whether the Japanese market will drop further and whether it might drag U.S. markets down with it is anyone 's guess. " No one can say whether we 'll be hurt because we 've never experienced anything like this with Japan, " says Charles Clough, Merrill Lynch &; Co. chief strategist. <p> The U.S. market 's drop Thursday was a " belated reaction to the Japanese market, " said Charles Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities. " We 've been ignoring that market for a couple of weeks. You can only ignore reality for so long. " <p> The Japanese stock market had lost $ 900 billion of its value from Jan. 1 through Thursday. <p> In just the first four days of this week, the Nikkei had plummeted 10%. The prospects for a further decline, and the uncertain implications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here more cautious. How investor confusion, nervousness, and caution exhibited itself Thursday : <p> - Shares of Walt Disney Co. dropped 3 to $ 111 7/8. Kidder, Peabody analyst Christopher Dixon said the stock could drop if Japanese investors decide to sell to raise cash to cover Tokyo market losses. U.S. investors did n't wait around for proof of Dixon 's theory. They started bailing out of the entertainment giant 's stock as soon as his remarks hit the news wires. <p> - Two major U.S. brokerages raised cash and cut stock positions in their model portfolios, in part because of the turmoil in Tokyo. Clough at Merrill Lynch recommended that investors reduce stocks to 40% of assets from 45%, raise cash to 10% from 5% and keep bonds at 50%. Morgan Stanley and Co. made a similar move. <p> " Central banks throughout the world are tightening credit. Short-term interest rates are climbing, " creating an unfavorable environment for stocks, Clough said. Most recently, the Bank of Japan raised its discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stem inflation and support the yen vs. other currencies. " We 're starting to see money get more expensive worldwide, " Clough says. <p> - U.S. bonds surged in early trading as investors worldwide bought Treasury bonds for a safehaven. But worries about whether Japanese investors would sell now or not buy U.S. bonds in upcoming auctions cooled the rally in the afternoon. <p> The Japanese also are confused about where interest rates are headed. " The bureaucrats have been feuding in public. The Bank of Japan has been pushing for higher interest rates while the Ministry of Finance has been resisting them, " says Kim Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon Bros. Asia in Tokyo. " The market has reacted by dropping. It 's like when Mommy and Daddy fight : The children get upset. " <p> The main fear among U.S. investors is that a further spiral in Japan could force Japanese investors to sell stocks and bonds overseas to cover losses in Tokyo, says Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process would start with Japanese institutional investors who bought stocks in Japan on margin - with borrowed money. As stocks drop, brokerages issue margin calls, asking clients to put up more cash or have their positions liquidated. To pay the debt, the investors sell U.S. stocks and bonds and take the cash home to meet the margin calls. Another reason floated for repatriation : Japanese investors who have seen their market bounce back from previous trouble could decide to go bargain-hunting in Japan, and sell U.S. stocks to raise cash for that. <p> So far, that has n't happened. In fact, through most of March, Japanese investors have jumped into U.S. stocks and bonds. That 's partly because the havoc in Japan has investors running for safety to the relative stability of the U.S. markets. <p> And because the yen has weakened against the dollar during the past few months, many Japanese institutional investors have bought U.S. stocks and bonds in the hopes of reaping a double gain - one from the stock or bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Japanese investor who spent 146,400 yen to buy $ 1,000 of U.S. stocks or bonds at the start of the year would have 155,450 yen late Thursday if that investment had held its price of $ 1,000. And if that investment gained, the Japanese investor would have reaped an even better return. So far this year, " The strength of the dollar is very reassuring for our markets, " Clough says. <p> Global market observers say a sudden wave of Japanese repatriation of investment money is highly unlikely as long as the dollar remains strong against the yen. " If you 're a Japanese investor, you wo n't sell U.S. bonds unless you 're really strapped for liquidity, " says George Noble, manager of Fidelity Overseas Fund. " If the Japanese yen is weak, you sell your Japanese stocks, not your foreign holdings. " And as Frank Jennings, strategist at AIG Global Investors, says : " Why sell a winner in the U.S. to buy a loser at home? It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diversifying their portfolios as Tokyo stocks weaken, says Masahiko Goto, vice president at New Japan Securities International. " Diversification will be the name of the game, " he says. <p> However, further Japanese stock market drops - say a 5,000-point dive in the Nikkei - could be damaging to U.S. markets long-term. Such a vast evaporation of wealth and liquidity could cripple Japanese investors ' ability to buy U.S. bonds. " If Japan fails to show up at our Treasury auctions because of a lack of new money, we 'd have to raise interest rates here substantially to attract buyers, " says Gavin Dobson, president of investment firm Murray Johnstone International. " That 's the greatest danger.
