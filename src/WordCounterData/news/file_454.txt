4028441 The eyes of Texas and the nation are focused on the red-hot Democratic primary race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. The presidential candidates themselves, however, have their sights set on a key audience they 're wooing in advance of the March 4 Texas primary : Hispanics. // And no county in Texas has more Latinos than Harris, where an estimated 15 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters are Hispanic. // After losing 11 straight primaries, Clinton must win delegate-rich Texas. Central to her strategy will be maintaining an edge among Hispanics, who have supported her by 2-to-1 margins in earlier primaries. With 26 delegates at stake in the Greater Houston area and Obama attracting votes from many demographic groups in recent primaries, Clinton will need strong support here from Hispanics to save her campaign. // It 's uncertain, though, how many Latinos will vote. Their turnout has been historically low, but many experts say excitement about the primary among Hispanics locally is unprecedented. // One thing about the Latino vote, and I 've been dealing with it for 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be center stage... they 're going to come out to vote, " predicts Marc Campos, a longtime Houston political consultant. // Not worried about primary // Rene Porras, owner of the Porras Prontito cafe in the Denver Harbor neighborhood in Houston, worries that chronic poverty, low educational levels and apathy will contribute to low Hispanic turnout. // I hate to say it, but Hispanics feel disenfranchised, " said Porras, who has not decided which candidate he 'll support. They think it 's not worth their time, that all politicians are crooks or they got an angle - that kind of stuff. " // And the poor, Porras said, are more worried about their light bills than delegate counts. // Copying California // In Harris County, Clinton looks to mirror her success in Super Tuesday primaries, when the New York senator won 64 percent of Hispanic voters. // In California, where Latino voters made up 30 percent of the voters, 69 percent voted for Clinton and 29 percent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to keep moving and her to stay in the game, " said Lydia Camarillo, vice president of the Southwest Voters Registration and Education Project in San Antonio, which registers Hispanic voters. // Camarillo predicts Hispanic turnout in Texas next month could rival the California primary, citing resources the Obama and Clinton campaigns are marshaling in Texas. // It 's going to be high, " Camarillo said. If we have 60 percent turnout out of total voters, as in California, I would say the share of the Latino electorate would be 30 to 35 percent. " // Increase in voters // Paul Bettencourt, Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector, said the percentage of young Hispanics registering to vote has increased the last five years. And 16.5 percent of the 12,253 voters who registered in a span of a few weeks before the Feb. 4 primary deadline had Spanish last names, he noted. // Harris County has 273,000 voters with Spanish last names on the current roll of 1,826,000 registered voters, said Hector de Leon, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Clinton has garnered support of a number of Hispanic elected officials in Houston, including state Sen. Mario Gallegos and County Commissioner Sylvia Garcia. // Texas is the state that can push her over the line, " said former City Council member Carol Alvarado, a Clinton campaign co-chair in Texas. You have a lot of things going here - you have a large Latino vote, and a long history of a relationship between both Bill and Hillary and Texas. " // Hillary Clinton often highlights her Texas connections by citing stories of helping register voters in the Rio Grande Valley in 1972. // Gallegos believes Clinton will receive the majority of the Hispanic vote in a Democratic primary that has energized Latino voters. // For the first time, they 're seeing where their vote means something, especially in a presidential election, " he said. And that 's why they 're coming out. " // Luring voters // Gallegos ' senatorial district, which is 70 percent Hispanic, has experienced low turnout in recent elections. Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary. // In the 2006 general election, only 25.6 percent of the district 's registered voters participated, compared with a 40.5 percent turnout across the state, according to an election analysis by the Texas Legislative Council. // But both candidates are airing Spanish-language ads and campaigning in South Texas. // Gallegos said Clinton 's championing of universal health care helps fuel her popularity among Hispanics. // The economy, education, the war, jobs - those issues mean nothing to a Texan or an American if they are not alive, " said Gallegos, who was gravely ill until receiving a liver transplant last year. That 's why health care, especially in the Hispanic community where the rate of diabetes is high, is a very important issue. " // Obama campaign spokesman Nick Shapiro acknowledged the Clintons ' deep connections with Hispanics in Texas. // However, given Senator Obama 's long track record of fighting for the Hispanic community, bringing Democrats and Republicans together to expand access to health care, cut taxes for working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support in the Hispanic community in Texas to grow steadily, " Shapiro said. // Support for Obama // Obama visited the Rio Grande Valley, Corpus Christi and Austin on Friday, after visits earlier in the week to Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. // A growing list of Hispanic elected officials supporting the Illinois senator includes state Rep. Ana Hernandez, an attorney whose district is 76 percent Hispanic and includes parts of east Houston, the Port of Houston and Pasadena. Hernandez said Obama will be able to attract Latino support. // It 's a mistake when people think that Latinos will automatically support Hillary, " Hernandez said. // Dora Olivo, a state representative whose district includes Missouri City, said she is backing Obama because of his immigrant background. His father is from Kenya. // He has lived in two worlds, " said Olivo, a second-generation Mexican-American.
