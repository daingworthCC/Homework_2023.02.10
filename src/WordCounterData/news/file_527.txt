4116441 A laser-like focus zeroed in on Ubaldo Jimenez when the Rockies confirmed his availability after the all-star break. # Truth is, there 's a better chance the man catching him will be traded. The Pirates want Chris Iannetta, eager to reinforce a position decimated by injuries. Former Rockies farmhand Mike McKenry is getting the bulk of playing time. # The Rockies are listening, providing insight not only on how they view Iannetta but top prospect Wilin Rosario. It would surprise no one if Rosario joins the Rockies on Aug. 1 or soon thereafter. He has enjoyed decent success in Double-A Tulsa, hitting.260 with 16 home runs and 36 RBIs. More importantly, he 's improved defensively and had no setbacks with his surgically repaired right knee. # Had Rosario not torn his ACL last August, he would have joined the Rockies. He 's on track for that promotion a year later. # The Indians and Red Sox could also use a catcher.( Same goes for the Giants, but I do n't see Colorado helping them.) General manager Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which could facilitate a deal. There are complications, of course. Neither Pittsburgh nor Cleveland is going to mortgage its future. The deal has to make sense, given where both are in the rebuilding stage. # Jimenez remains the most intriguing Rockies piece. O'Dowd created parameters a week ago when he told me it would take a " Herschel Walker-type deal " to move the Rockies ace. In talking to multiple executives and scouts, it 's clear the Rockies want three players in return for Jimenez. They have talked up nearly everyone, including the Royals, to see if they would part with some of baseball 's most prized young players. # The price is so high, it 's left some executives questioning whether any deal will get done. But the Rockies have n't pulled Jimenez off the showroom floor. So until they do, nothing can be dismissed out of hand. # The Reds and Yankees are considered the best matches, though Texas and Boston are lurking. Cincinnati has several players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect Devin Mesoraco, first baseman Yonder Alonso and outfielder Todd Frazier. For this deal to be the surefire win the Rockies are seeking, it would have to, in my opinion, include starter Edinson Volquez. # The Reds have also called Tampa Bay about starter James Shields. His price is equally high, but Tampa 's apathetic attendance makes payroll a factor in its decisions. The Rockies are under no financial pressure to make a move. # The Yankees possess the pieces to get Ubaldo, but are in no hurry to part with catcher Jesus Montero and pitchers Dellin Betances and Manny Banuelos. Could that change? Of course. But for the Yankees to sign off, they have to believe that Jimenez is better than A.J. Burnett and Phil Hughes. The Yankees are making the playoffs. They need pitchers who are going to help them win the World Series. # Texas brass wants another crack at the ring, and bristles at the idea of Boston or New York swooping in on Jimenez. The Rangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't yet prepared to make the type of offer the Rockies seek, viewing Jimenez as a No. 2 starter in trade, not a bona fide ace. Boston is a bit of a longshot, though Clay Buchholz 's health bears watching as it relates to Jimenez. # With Carlos Gonzalez going on the disabled list, it created the sense the Rockies are officially open for business. They have taken calls on Ty Wigginton and Ryan Spilborghs, would move Eric Young Jr. and could still get late interest in Rafael Betancourt and Matt Belisle. Boston covets a right-handed bat, making Wigginton a potential fit. Philadelphia is also looking, and could circle back to the Rockies if it misses out on Carlos Beltran and Hunter Pence. # Footnotes. The promotion of young star Desmond Jennings has heightened speculation that Tampa Bay will trade B.J. Upton. Trevor Cahill 's ERA was filled with helium last week. He became the first A 's starter since Pete Naktenis in 1936 to surrender at least 10 earned runs without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trade offers for Pence and Beltran are expected to make a play for San Diego 's Ryan Ludwick.

Former Rockies pitcher Jason Jennings said Pence reminded him of Ichabod Crane. Pence has a unique frame, gangly and frenetic. He has always been a dangerous hitter, earning two all-star berths. # What 's up : Contenders are texting, dialing - everything but tweeting - in an effort to find an offensive boost. The Phillies are at the front of the line for Pence. He has had a terrific season for a terrible team. He 's ranked among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has respectable power( 11 home runs) and can steal a base if necessary. The Phillies would love his right-handed bat in their lineup, filling the void left by free-agent defector Jayson Werth. # Renck 's take : The growing feeling among executives is that Carlos Beltran, high on the Phillies list, will end up in San Francisco. Pence profiles better because Philadelphia would have him under its control through 2013. The problem is that Houston 's demands are so outrageous for Pence that it makes some wonder if the Astros are serious about trading the outfielder. They want three players in return, including top prospect Domonic Brown, a likely deal breaker. That 's a haul, and could leave a team like the Phillies focusing on Reed Johnson or even Ryan Spilborghs, a player they have called about over multiple seasons. The Astros are under orders to move money and want to trade pitchers Wandy Rodriguez or Brett Myers. However, if the market remains lukewarm for those two, Houston might become more flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like his swing a lot, ' fellow all-star Troy Tulowitzki said. I can see why teams want him. ' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- AT ISSUE # Making adjustment from playing to DH'ing not easy transition # What : White Sox slugger Adam Dunn had $56 million reasons to accept the White Sox 's free-agent contract offer. No amount of money can soothe his misery. # When : Dunn has failed miserably this season in his conversion from a National League player to a full-time DH. He is hitting.163, which would be the lowest ever by a player qualifying for a batting title. That groan you heard was fantasy league owners punching themselves in the face. # Background : Dunn 's value swelled in the post-steroid era. Three years ago, he was a luxury with limited suitors. The Nationals took a low-risk flier when no one else seemed interested. Then with home runs going the way of the pet rock and VCR player, Dunn became a prized commodity last winter. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he could adjust to not playing in the field every day. # Renck 's take : Dunn is Pat Burrell, the sequel. Burrell was a fantastic player for the Phillies when he bolted for Tampa Bay. He was terrible with the Rays. Both Dunn and Burrell profile as DHs. They have power and limited defensive skills. But playing in the field diverts attention from at-bats, can help clear the mind. As Dunn fell into his awful funk, he was left alone with his thoughts in the dugout. So miserable, he even talked of leaving the game last week, though quickly squashed retirement ideas Friday. Jason Giambi has excelled as a DH by thinking along with the manager and staying busy in the cage during games. It 's a role, he admits, that is not for everyone. Problem for Dunn is that it 's the only one available in Chicago. Look for the White Sox to start sitting him if they make a move in the standings.

Giants : They entered the weekend 30-21 since Buster Posey 's injury, a testament to their pitching and resolve. # 3. Red Sox : Offense is a wrecking ball, leading in every significant category, including on-base and slugging percentages. # THREE DOWN # 1. Mariners : Last year had worst offense since DH era began. This year they have worst offense since DH era began. Next year # 2. Rays : Could shift to sellers this week, with James Shields and B.J. Upton their biggest pieces. # 3. Nationals : Disappointment in Jayson Werth palpable. As rule, do n't pay star money to good players from great teams. # #
