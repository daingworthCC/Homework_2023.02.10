4191841 <p> Last week marked the 25th anniversary of the liberation of Kuwait, a textbook case of successful military intervention for one primary reason : The United States government forswore regime change. That Middle Eastern event contrasts dramatically with those since 9/11. <p> The best that can be done with rogue states is provide humanitarian aid, strengthen borders, cultivate cooperation and avoid inflaming passions. <p> In his 2006 memoir, James Baker III, former secretary of state, wrote " I am no longer asked why we did not remove Saddam in 1991! " While no collective undertaking is simple, the American government found it comparatively easy to organize international opposition to Saddam Hussein 's August 1990 attack on Kuwait. <p> The reasons made common sense : clear provocation and proportionate response. Hussein 's attack was not a border war or civil war, which are notoriously messy and hard to fathom or fix from afar. Instead, it was the first time since the start of the United Nations that one country swallowed a friendly neighbor whole. Hussein dubbed Kuwait his " Nineteenth Province " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.N. Security Council was not asked to judge the merits of Iraq 's or Kuwait 's internal governments( beauty and legitimacy being so often in the eyes of the beholder), only whether or not highway robbery should be allowed to " stand, " to paraphrase President George H. W. Bush. <p> The Bush administration wisely eschewed regime change, a foreign policy whose objectives may be likened to making a better family out of an unhappy one next door. Outside military forces can help destroy a regime, as they did in Libya in 2011, but they can not create a viable indigenous government. Countries must do that themselves or suffer internal chaos and collapse. The United States learned that lesson in its own Civil War roughly 150 years ago. <p> The best outsiders can do for " failed " or " rogue " states is provide humanitarian aid as evenhandedly as possible, strengthen borders to contain spill-over violence, cultivate cooperation with Interpol and stable neighbors, and avoid inflaming passions by attempting to make or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War, the United States never once tried to change the repressive regimes of communist Russia or China. The path was too perilous( it always is) and led to a dangerous mirage of a perfect, controllable world. Troubled countries have to recreate themselves -- just as we did -- in order to cohere and thrive. It is high time to revisit this lesson in the Middle East.
