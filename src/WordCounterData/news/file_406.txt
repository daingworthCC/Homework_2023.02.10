3068641 <p> Counting blessings <p> Thank you Jeannie McCabe( July 11 column, " From Here to Serenity ") for( once again) making us realize that you do n't have to look very far to find someone much worse off than you are. RICHARD N. GLICK Westminster Victim punished <p> I have just finished reading Chuck Green 's column in the July 12 Post( " Graffiti message smudged ") and must admit I was stunned. What was Judge Campbell thinking of? When is our so-called justice system going to quit punishing the victims of crime? <p> I realize Mr. Quintana assaulted the three punks who sprayed his property with paint, but he was assaulted first, and surely his punishment should have been no greater than that handed out to the three vandals. They received one day of work ; Quintana, 40 days of community service. Hopefully the day of work will entail their cleaning up the mess they made, or perhaps the judge will do that in his spare time. I will remember Judge Campbell 's name, and I hope others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our city. And let 's all remember the prosecutor, Robert Reynolds, too. Mayor Webb appointed him. Why does n't the mayor help people like Mr. Quintana instead of rewarding the vandals who cause the trouble? Ah well, perhaps the next graffiti artists will attack either Reynolds, Webb or even Judge Campbell - and then maybe, just maybe, something will be done to stop this mayhem. BARBARA COOK Denver Daily affront <p> Thank you for the truths revealed in Chuck Green 's July 12 column. I live two blocks off of South Federal, so graffiti is a daily outrage and assault. I am astounded to find out that the graffiti vandals who defaced Mike Quintana 's building got a one-day community service sentence. That is like saying, " So there, community! Do n't even bother us with the work of prosecuting these punks! We hope they never get caught! " <p> I want the rest of Denver to know how we in southwest Denver suffer from graffiti. Every day it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, brick, stucco - anything that is hard to cover or repair is defaced nightly by ugly graffiti that is arrogant and defiant. Merchants are out thousands of dollars monthly. Graffiti vandals are finally caught, and each gets only one day of community service? Something is wrong! <p> Here we thought that once we actually caught a vandal, justice would be done! Now we know the system could n't be bothered. I 'll bet " the system " does n't live where I do. JAN MARIE BELLE Denver Aim misstated <p> Kathleen Parker 's column June 28( " Curbing teen pregnancies would be worthy charity ") describes a newly formed group called Responsible Wealth as " rich people( trying to) figure out what to do with all their money. " As a member of the group, I can tell you she misstated what Responsible Wealth is about. <p> Responsible Wealth is a national network of business leaders, investors and inheritors concerned about growing economic inequality and organized to promote fairer economic rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair Economy, a Boston-based national group concerned about our country 's growing gap between rich and poor. <p> In 1970, pay for chief executives averaged 41 times what average workers earn ; in 1997, CEO pay was up to 326 times workers ' pay. In 1976, the wealthiest 1 percent in this country owned 19 percent of all the private wealth ; the top 1 percent now owns over 40 percent. The share of the bottom 90 percent has shrunk from 51 percent to 28 percent. Is this the kind of society we want? <p> It means a lot when beneficiaries of the system speak out against its inequities. Over 325 people have joined Responsible Wealth. The group is focusing on tax fairness, reducing the wage gap, and promoting corporate responsibility. <p> As a retired corporate executive, I joined Responsible Wealth because I do n't believe the growing economic divide is in our country 's long-term best interest, and I am not content to sit back idly and watch the situation grow worse. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort. WILLIAM P. DENSMORE United for a Fair Economy/Responsible Wealth Worcester, Mass. Stop Starr-bashing <p> Your anti-GOP, Clinton-defending bias is reinforced by the July 10 editorial " Starr-crossed issues. " You laud the court 's decision to deny Starr access to lawyer notes and bash the decision to allow Secret Service testimony. You( properly, I think) suggest that Congress deal with the issue of Secret Service immunity, but describe the current Congress as too partisan to deal with it fairly. <p> You say the Clinton presidency is under siege by Starr, but neglect to remind the reader that it is the Clinton White House 's behavior that has led Starr to resort to such actions as requests for lawyer notes and Secret Service testimony to try to find the truth. If Clinton had cooperated with the independent counsel, the Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate and Lewinski matters would likely have been put to rest months ago. His delays, stonewalling, attacks on his accusers and attacks on Starr convince me the president is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth. If we are ever to hear the truth in these matters, I suspect it will come from Kenneth Starr, not Bill Clinton. ROBERT LINES Littleton ' Cure ' is worse <p> It 's about time someone spoke out about this inane drug war as Ed Quillen did in his July 12 column( " Can anybody tell us what victory means in this longest war? "). In the past, the media( free public service announcements) and the government at all levels have acted as though there were only one side to this issue. All of a sudden, the public seems to be waking up and listening to the other side. Do n't get me wrong - I 'm not in favor of kids or adults abusing drugs. Been there, done that! I 'm lucky to have survived. But the fact is, the current " cure " is worse than the disease. <p> Not only is the drug war bankrupting us morally and financially, but it 's also not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teenagers are the very ones the DARE program was targeting when they were in the first and second grade. The prisons are full of pushers, yet for every one jailed, new ones take their place. Anyone wishing to buy drugs, even kids, has no problem acquiring them. Drugs are readily available even in maximum-security prisons. If we ca n't keep drugs out of prisons, how do we think we can control them in a " free " society? <p> I have spoken to several of the candidates about this very issue. Amazingly, many will agree with me in private. One went so far as to say, " I agree with you, but I 'm not willing to commit political suicide. " According to Mr. Quillen, Jack Woehr, candidate for state representative, has the courage to challenge the status quo. I wish Mr. Woehr the best of luck and hope other politicians muster the courage to tackle the drug war problem as well. JOE BEAVER Arvada Ads are dishonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 billion anti-drug media campaign, I doubt it will do any good because the anti-drug ads are n't honest about drugs, and teenagers know it. <p> These ads talk about " marijuana and cocaine " as if these drugs are on the same level. I 've heard ads by The Partnership for a Drug-Free America make claims about pot that are totally baseless. Most kids, by the time they graduate high school, have tried pot and know it is almost harmless. So when they see ads that depict pot as a dangerous drug, they know they are n't being told the truth. <p> If the government is not truthful about pot, kids reason, it probably is n't truthful about drugs that really are dangerous, like heroine, cocaine or methamphetamine. So kids might try drugs they normally would n't. <p> Teenagers are smarter than we give them credit for, and many more kids will respond to the truth. But if we are n't honest about drugs, these teenagers are going to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer than drinking a beer, we might as well throw the $ 2 billion away. MARC PERKEL Springfield, Mo. Hikers intrusive <p> I 'd like to respond to Mr. Williams ' letter of July 12, " No way in. " We live at the foot of Coal Creek Peak. We have had to put up with as many as 20 cars on the road in front of us. The hikers would drive up early, park, eat their fast-food breakfasts, throw the litter on the ground and start hiking past the no-trespassing sign on the gate. <p> When I once confronted two of them, asking why they did n't use the trail built at taxpayer expense off Colorado 93, they said it was too far to walk. The county finally posted the road as a no-parking zone. A couple of the signs mysteriously disappeared, but a couple of cars were ticketed and the message got across. <p> Our neighbor on El Dorado Mountain is confronted regularly by hikers on his property. Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he enjoy having lines of people hiking through his property? We could give hikers permission to cross our property to climb, but why should we? Most of us live here for one reason. It 's quiet and peaceful. <p> Unfortunately, this may end with a developer who is trying to get his property rezoned for 95 homes at our southern boundary. Perhaps Mr. Williams will be able to get permission to tramp over their land to get to the mountain. Until then, Mr. Williams, there 's " no way in. " MR. AND MRS. B. STUBBS Golden Train trip across Siberia a delight for this reader ; boredom was absent <p> This is in response to the July 5 write-up by Doug Lansky( " Trans-Manchurian train trip a candidate for boredom, " Travel section). He and I must have ridden the same route with different eyes. <p> In 1988, I spent four nights and four days riding the Trans Siberian Railroad from Moscow to Irkutsz. It was summertime, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Siberia : many kinds of trees in thick woods, ponds, small lakes, small houses built of logs or boards, a stacked woodpile beside each door, some livestock and gardens, a scene much like rural areas in the U.S. many years ago. <p> Our party of Americans ate three meals daily in a diner. We had to walk through 17 rail coaches to reach the diner. So what? We had the time. When traveling, one tends to forget the calendar. One night, upon arriving in the diner, there was an air of excitement with the workers. When it was time to serve dessert, our translator informed us the help had purchased a dessert with their own money to celebrate our successful revolution. It was then we realized the day was July 4. <p> When passing the open doors of the compartments, a smile at a Russian family would usually get one in return. During the walks, I managed to communicate to some extent with local passengers, especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's books, coloring books, Mickey Mouse stickers, small American things, made openings and smiles without words. <p> Recently, I returned to Irkutsk after traveling in Mongolia and the Gobi Desert to finish the train ride. It took three more days and nights to reach Khabarovsk, ending a short distance west of Vladivostok. The ride around Lake Balkal was spectacular. There was a samovar at the end of the coach with an attendant ready to make Chi any time day or night. No tip expected. <p> Too bad Doug Lansky could n't appreciate the history and struggles of the Russian people, the tremendous accomplishment of building the Trans-Siberian RR, the warmth and friendliness of the Russian people. Maybe he was too young. HARRIETT DALLAS Denver Protest at home <p> Chuck Green 's column July 5( " Snuff out sales of fireworks ") struck a sympathetic cord. Calls from citizens frustrated with fireworks jammed the 911 center in Boulder County the night of July 4. But Mr. Green 's conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty information. <p> Colorado law makes it illegal to possess or use any fireworks that leave the ground or explode. Most sheriffs conduct rigorous inspections of fireworks outlets. Fireworks sold under those big tents are cones, fountains and sparklers, not the types driving us all nuts. <p> Ask any 17-year-old with pop bottle rockets and firecrackers spilling out of his pockets where he got the stuff. The answer is always " Wyoming. " Everything from rockets to lady fingers to the big stuff, like cherry bombs and M-80s, is available a little more than an hour 's drive from the metro area. <p> Chuck Green 's attack on county officials seems out of line when you consider that The Denver Post included multipage, full-color insert ads for Phantom Fireworks 2 miles inside the Wyoming line a week before the Fourth of July. Although the advertising contained fine print warning that the stuff was illegal in some areas, the fact that it was mass-marketed leads me to conclude that Mr. Green had better take his complaints to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county officials. GEORGE EPP Boulder County Sheriff Boulder Let freedom ring <p> I always suspected Chuck Green was the Church Lady out of drag, but his July 5 column on banning fireworks sales proves it. Sure, just let the nanny state keep us all safe and tuck us in bed at a reasonable hour, after impressing us with a G-rated display that only the government is capable of conducting. <p> C'm on, Chuck. Did n't you blast off cherry bombs and M-80s and burn yourself a good one? <p> Consider those " pathetic, cheap and unsafe " home displays Green moans about. Cheap? Not anymore, with all those lawyers around. Pathetic? Yeah, compared with what used to be available. When I was 6, sparklers and ladyfingers were anything but " pathetic, " and I could hardly wait to graduate to Black Cats, cherry bombs and( gasp) M-80s. <p> The Fourth was, and still is, the high point of summer for a lot of American kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fireworks then. Perhaps the innocuous stuff today contributes to lax attitudes. <p> The racket did n't calm down in Pueblo until 2:30 a.m. The parents of one of my co-workers are visiting town, and they 've got a Pomeranian who is n't very patriotic. <p> I feel sorry for the dog, and like a lot of old people, I did n't sleep too well, either. But I was young once, and I 'm not so senile that I 've forgotten the reason for the partying. <p> If Independence Day is boring, will we have our kids ' attention when we try to teach them what it 's about? Sorry, Chuck, those sirens and bangs and whistles and howling dogs are n't noise. They 're notes in the song of freedom. DAVE SKINNER Pueblo Illogical argument <p> Reading " Moving Toward an Official History " by Patrisia Gonzales and Roberto Rodriguez( July 5 column) made me wish I was in logic class again. My instructor assigned us to find logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! To list a few : <p> Loaded language. Using emotionally charged words : " It is part of a well-orchestrated, step-by-step ' anti-rights ' movement, initiated by right-wing fanatics " <p> Hasty generalization. " The logic of those opposed to ethnic studies " Implying that all people who oppose this have such reasoning. <p> Slippery slope, false cause for effect : " Can mass book burnings and intellectual inquisitions be far off? " <p> It is discouraging to see sloppy reasoning that relies on the emotions and prejudices of the readers. I do n't like to see it in conservative, liberal or third-party writings ; I do n't like to find it in my writings either. This type of rhetoric is persuasive in America, and I pray that many would wake up and reject this garbage. SHAWN MATHIS Thornton Exercise in rhetoric <p> The column by Gonzales and Rodriguez insults one 's intelligence by a form of rhetoric that has come to be exercised too freely. <p> It is a disingenuous appeal to the unthinking, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit to any argument against ethnic studies. This question is loaded with merit, surely. To dismiss it at the outset is irresponsible. Depending on the content, an ethnic course certainly has the ability to inflame, isolate, arouse racial animosities, encourage the notion of exclusive rights or of something that is owed : victimhood. <p> Why fear a national review naming it a subterfuge for elimination, unless that is what supporters of ethnic studies believe a fair review will lead to? <p> I am in favor of ethnic studies under two conditions : The course is given only when it attracts enough students by its own merit, and provides valid and substantial content along with its relation to other content, avoiding exaggerations and distortions that go under the name heritage. I am against ethnic and historical studies if they fail to meet both those conditions. If universities are at sea as to how to resolve the issue, let them use these criteria. Legislators should not ban courses, although I might concur with laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case, as representatives of the people, it is assuredly their business to seek quality in education.
