3065641 <p> Former Vice President Al Gore, hoping to spur action on legislation to fight climate change, warned Congress of a planetary emergency and urged lawmakers of both parties to put the Earth 's future ahead of partisan politics. <p> " I promise you a day will come when our children and grandchildren will look back and they will ask one of two questions, " Gore told a House panel Wednesday. " Either they will ask, ' What in God 's name were they doing? ' " or " they 'll say, ' How did they find the uncommon courage to rise above politics and redeem the promise of American democracy? ' " <p> Gore 's appearances on both sides of Capitol Hill showed how far the debate over climate change has shifted in the 30 years since he began holding some of Congress ' first hearings on global warming as a young representative from Tennessee. <p> " The world is finally paying attention, " Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., chair of the House Science and Technology Committee, said at Wednesday 's hearing. <p> Gore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming documentary " An Inconvenient Truth, " also has made him a bigger target of his opponents in Congress. They accused him Wednesday of exaggerating scientific claims to scare the public and proposing solutions that could hurt the U.S. economy. <p> But Gore 's position is increasingly shared by many Republicans in Congress, who are calling for some action on climate change. Gore 's supporters say his relentless advocacy on the issue has played a part. <p> " In Tennessee, we sometimes say about an especially determined horse that he gets the bit in his teeth and you ca n't turn him, " said Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who introduced Gore at the Senate hearing. <p> Gore 's return to Congress was orchestrated by Democratic leaders, who expected that his high-profile testimony would focus the public 's attention and build support for the party 's efforts to pass major climate change legislation this year. The speculation that he might run again for president only heightened the buzz. <p> Gore was mobbed by TV cameras the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill in a black Mercury Mariner, a hybrid SUV. The line for the public to get into the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room snaked around the building. The hearing was so packed that a few lawmakers sat in seats reserved for the public just to listen. <p> Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., jokingly referred to Gore 's new role as " a thinker, a personality and now movie star. " <p> " Rin Tin Tin was a movie star, " Gore responded. " I just have a slide show. " <p> Gore quickly got into a sparring match with the panel 's ranking Republican, Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, who alleged that Gore had exaggerated scientific claims of rising sea levels and increased malaria infections due to warming. Barton also challenged Gore 's assertion that rising carbon dioxide levels were the main cause of rising temperatures. <p> " Mr. Vice President, you 're not just a little off, " Barton said. " You 're totally wrong. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide had repeatedly been shot down by the National Academy of Science and by other respected scientific bodies. <p> " The planet has a fever, " Gore said. " If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor. If the doctor says, ' You have to intervene here, ' you do n't say, ' Well, I read a science fiction novel that says this is n't important. ' If the crib 's on fire, you do n't speculate that the baby is flame-retardant. " <p> Gore also laid out an ambitious set of solutions to global warming, including a call for an immediate freeze on greenhouse gas emissions, a ban on incandescent bulbs and a tax on carbon pollution, which he said would replace the payroll tax. He conceded, however, that Congress was likely to be leery of his tax plan. <p> " I fully understand this is considered politically impossible, but part of our challenge is to expand the limits of what 's possible, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Gore 's assessment that climate change is a real threat. But the former speaker warned that Gore 's prescription for cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes could hurt U.S. businesses. Barton added that Gore 's proposed freeze on carbon emissions would mean " no new industry, no new people and no new cars. " <p> But Democrats praised Gore 's proposals as innovative ideas that could make their way into legislation. At a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., said she was impressed by Gore 's proposal to start a new national mortgage program that helped the public invest in energy-saving technologies in their homes. <p> Gore 's appearance before the Senate was highly anticipated, because he was facing off against the Congress 's chief climate change skeptic : Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who famously called global warming the " greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. " <p> Inhofe accused Gore of hypocrisy for asking people to change their lifestyles while he lives in a mansion outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average U.S. household -- a charge first aired by a Tennessee advocacy group that 's become a favorite of Gore critics. <p> " Are you willing to change the way you live? " Inhofe asked. <p> Gore started to explain that he was already buying power from renewable sources and was trying to get zoning rules changes so he could install solar panels. But Inhofe cut him off, saying he was taking too much time -- which enraged California Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Democrat who chairs the panel. <p> " How can you ask the question and not give a man a minute to answer? " Boxer said, who gave Gore extra time, explaining that now that she chairs the committee, " I make the rules. " <p> At the end of the hearing, Boxer called Gore a role model who would be judged well by history for his early warnings about the threat of global warming. <p> Gore appeared almost embarrassed by the praise. " Now, you do n't give out any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. Al Gore urges senators to freeze greenhouse gas emissions and ban incandescent bulbs. / Jim Young / Reuters
