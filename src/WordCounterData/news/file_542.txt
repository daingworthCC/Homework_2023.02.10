4127741 Lee Woodruff has long wanted to write what she calls a " real-life " novel, the kind she loves that lets " you read about someone else 's ordeals and not feel quite so alone. " Books, she says, like Anna Quindlen 's Every Last One, or Wallace Stegner 's Crossing to Safety, personal favorites. But she 's not sure she would have written the particular debut novel she did, Those We Love Most( Voice, $26.99), to be released Tuesday, if her husband, ABC News ' Bob Woodruff, had n't been severely injured and nearly died while reporting in Iraq in 2006. " It helped me better understand grief and going through hard times and getting to a better place, " she says. Six years after Bob Woodruff 's traumatic brain injury, when surgeons replaced a portion of his skull with plastic, he says, " I 'm getting back to normal, " at home and at work, as a national correspondent for ABC. On a recent morning at their airy, beach-style home, 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound, Lee and Bob are coming and going. Lee, 52, a part-time on-air contributor to CBS This Morning, seems wide awake, just three hours after getting home at 6 a.m. on a red-eye flight from California.( The TV story she was taping : the problems that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder have driving.) Bob, 51, is packing for an afternoon flight to New Orleans for a story for Nightline.( His assignment : Mormon missionaries in the Big Easy.) With their four children( one boy, three girls, ages 21 to 12) at day camp or summer jobs, it 's time to reverse their usual public roles : Lee talking about Bob, whom she calls " a walking miracle. " Now it 's Bob 's turn to praise his wife, the novelist. " I 'm not surprised she 's written a novel. I 'm just surprised that first, she wrote two non-fiction books. "( More on that later.) When he mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " in the early years of his recovery -- that leads to a husband-and-wife comedy routine : " He forgets to take out the garbage, " she complains. " That 's the great thing about traumatic brain injury, " he deadpans. " It gives you an excuse. When she tells me to clean up the garage, I can say, ' What 's a garage? ' " He says he gets tired faster than he used to but still plays tennis and soccer, " old-man stuff. " " Yeah, " she jokes, " they have an ambulance waiting. " None of the characters in Lee 's novel, set in suburban Chicago, are journalists or are injured in war. It 's about a 9-year-old boy who dies after being hit by a car, and how his death affects his parents and grandparents and their marriages. Novel of resilience, not sadness The book is being released on Bob and Lee 's 24th wedding anniversary, which she says is coincidental " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed as a " sad book, " although she knows that 's a challenge. In trying to describe it, she has told prospective readers, " Well, a child dies. " Some respond, " Oh, I ca n't read those books! " The boy 's death occurs early in the novel. " Most of the book is about what happens in the aftermath, " she says, " how people come together and the choices they make. " Its early drafts were more about loss, she says. Now, it 's more about " the cost and proof of resilience. " It 's far from autobiographical, although Lee 's 80-year-old-father has Alzheimer 's, as does one of her fictional characters. Other emotional echoes of her life can be detected in her fiction. Early in the novel, the mother, Maura Corrigan, whose child has been struck by a car, ca n't stop replaying the accident in her mind. She imagines if she had been more alert she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the street. She could have reduced the accident to nothing more than a close call. " But that was magical thinking, " Woodruff writes in the novel. " There were no do-overs. And every time she let her mind wander, every time she gave herself the luxury, she was slapped in the face by the enormity of that fact that this was really happening. " In her real life, Woodruff calls that feeling " the tape playing in my head. " She played that tape imagining the moment in Taji, Iraq, in 2006, when Bob, just a month after being named co-anchor of World News Tonight, was riding in a tank that was hit by a roadside bomb. " For ages, I was haunted by the split-second nature of fate and timing and good and bad luck, " Lee says. " I kept trying to make the tape in my head do something different, have a different outcome. Finally, after a long time, I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go. That 's where the acceptance part comes in, I suppose. " Near the end of the novel, Maura reflects that " Life was teaching her that so much of everything was out of her control. And she would have to be all right with that if she wanted to keep moving forward, enjoying the passage of time. Otherwise, what kind of life did she stand to have? " In real life, Woodruff recalls the 36 days her husband was in a coma : " In my ' worst-case scenario brain, ' at the lowest moments, I 'd sneak into my kids ' rooms and look at them. I had temporarily lost my husband -- my best friend -- but I 'd think to myself : ' They are the reason to go on. Your family is the most important thing. ' " In 1994, Lee and Bob had what she calls " our first brush with grief, " when their son, named Christian, was stillborn. She says she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but " that grief prepared me, in some way, for the grief to come, " when Bob was nearly killed in Iraq. It also taught her that " as trite as it may sound, time really is the ultimate healer. We 're all built to survive. " Her novel was triggered by a phone call three years ago. A friend told her about a boy who had been hit by a car and suffered a brain injury. The friend asked if Lee could talk to his parents based on her own experiences. The boy recovered. Lee never spoke to his parents, but she began thinking about the 17-year-old driver, who was not at fault, and how " one instant can change everything in several lives. " That grew into her novel. It 's Lee 's third book. She and Bob co-wrote the 2007 best-selling memoir, In an Instant : A Family 's Journey of Love and Healing, although he credits her with " about 75% of it. " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for part of it. " He 's more the adrenaline-fueled reporter who likes to stick to the facts ; she 's more introspective, interested in emotions. When they were writing their joint memoir, she 'd read sections he had written, then ask him : " But how did you feel? " And Bob, she says, would roll his eyes. Lee has written for magazines, including Redbook and FamilyFun, and published a 2009 collection of essays, Perfectly Imperfect, but fiction is her first love. Growing up in Albany, N.Y., she loved to make up stories, and as she got older, " writing evolved into my way of making some sense of the world, especially going through more difficult things. " She says she kept a journal " through many of the tough periods, when we had a bad miscarriage, when Bob was embedded in Iraq, when our daughter( one of her 12-year-old twins) was diagnosed as deaf. I wrote through the entire time Bob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Colgate University in upstate New York, she took creative-writing courses and dreamed of becoming a novelist, but her kids and jobs in marketing and public relations got in the way.( As Bob was beginning his climb on the TV career ladder, with stops in Redding, Calif., Richmond, Va., Phoenix and Chicago, on his way to ABC, she says, " My income was vital to the family. ") And as a working mother, " I just kept thinking I 'd need giant tracts of uninterrupted time and kids out of the nest to focus on something as major as a novel. " Instead, she ended up " scribbling ideas, " whenever she had a free moment, which is why " my original draft has syrup stains on it. I wrote parts of it at the kitchen table. " Second novel in the works Yet she was n't sure how well she could make the jump from non-fiction to fiction. " Anyone can write a memoir, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a quick " oops! " in fear of sounding like a literary snob.( For those keeping score, Somers has written 20 books, including The Sexy Years and Sexy Forever.) She was relieved after literary agent Richard Pine read her manuscript and told her : " I did n't know if you had the chops. But you 've got the chops. " Pine says, " Even the most experienced and acclaimed journalists often do n't successfully make the leap from one form to the other, so being told by an experienced, professional reader that ' You 've done it. You 've got it, ' fills a well of lingering self-doubt. " A Publishers Weekly review of the novel says " Woodruff 's deft navigation of emotionally troubled territory makes this a riveting and heartfelt read, " but also notes she " occasionally falls into the trap of too much telling and not enough showing. " She has begun a second novel about a happy marriage and does n't mind if she remains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me if I had a ghostwriter for my parts of In an Instant, " she says. " I think people just assumed that the wife of probably could n't have a talent of my own. I never took offense -- better to undersell yourself and leave them wanting more, hopefully much more. "
