3073241 <p> E-C Records owner Charles Freeman had defiantly ordered a shipment of 25 copies of " As Nasty As They Wan na Be " and was doing a brisk business when an undercover officer bought the double-album and a cassette for $$8.49 each. <p> Before the detective reached the door, six deputies rushed in, handcuffing Freeman and arresting him on misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene material. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined $$1,000. ## " America is free, free for everybody, " Freeman said before authorities took him to the Broward County Jail, where he was booked and posted $$100 bond. " And as long as this is America and I 'm not living in Cuba, I feel my rights are violated. " <p> The arrest came two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez found that the sexually explicit recording was without social value, appealed only to prurient interests and violated community standards in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. <p> Lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain misogynist references and advocate violence, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable has finally occurred, " said Robyn E. Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida. " Someone in Broward is facing jail time because he sold a record album to an adult. That action put south Florida about on a par with Eastern Europe - a year ago. " <p> She said the ACLU will offer legal representation to Freeman. <p> The Miami-based rap group sued after Sheriff Nick Navarro sent his deputies in March to warn retailers they faced arrest for selling the album. The sheriff acted after a county judge said the material was " probably obscene. " <p> Gonzalez said the sheriff 's office engaged in prior restraint of free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled obscene. <p> The judge listened to 2 Live Crew 's recording, which offers a frank, detailed discussion of sexual positions and practices. He also heard witnesses and legal anti-censorship arguments May 14-15 before issuing his opinion. <p> Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts &; Sciences, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling as politically motivated. <p> " It pungently underlines the oppressive right-wing political agenda that is attempting to legislate morality in all the arts, including music. It 's another attempt to smother freedom in this country, freedom for the recording artist. " <p> In the three hours before his arrest, Freeman said, he sold all but six copies of the recording. He said a line had formed outside the shop in anticipation of the shipment 's arrival. <p> " I 'll go to jail, and I 'll come back and sell it again, " he said. " I opened up a record store three years ago expecting to sell records and this was the furthest thing from my mind. " <p> Authorities confiscated the remaining recordings. <p> Friends and customers packed into E-C Records to complain after he was taken to jail for booking on the misdemeanor charge. <p> Assistant manager Edward G. Robinson said Freeman felt strongly about the issue. <p> " If we can buy them, Mr. Freeman will sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Personally, I do n't care for the inside of a jail cell. " <p> " Why they 'd pick this one guy? " asked Gary White, 27, in the shop with his 19-month-old son. " Once they take the rights away from one guy, it 's going to spread. It 's not right when a person ca n't express himself. " <p> The judge 's obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south Florida, but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading nationally. <p> Supplies of the disputed record dried up in the Miami area as the obscenity case was argued, but the decision was expected to boost sales elsewhere. <p> The decision had no effect on the group 's plans for shows Friday night at Club Nu in Miami Beach and Saturday night at Club Futura in nearby Hollywood. ##
