3069141 <p> Rather than pushing opposing NFL defenses, Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis has been pushing himself to get back on the field. But the truth hurts as much as his sprained left foot. <p> Davis simply is not ready to play. <p> Davis managed to play some of Sunday 's first half, carrying the ball six times for 41 yards before exiting the Broncos ' 23-22 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs late in the second quarter. Davis said he did not leave the AFC West game because he reinjured his foot. He left, he said, because his foot bothered him too much to continue. <p> ' I just did n't have the feeling that I wanted to have, ' Davis said at Mile High Stadium. ' It just was n't there. ' <p> Davis reported his foot is improving, but not to the point where he can play a full game. After icing his foot Sunday night, Davis hopes to resume practicing this week and be ready for the Broncos ' next game, against the New England Patriots at Mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Sunday, no one can say with any confidence whether he will. <p> ' I 'm just going to keep getting treatment and hopefully strengthening it up for next week, ' said Davis, who injured his foot during Denver 's Week 1 loss at St. Louis against the Rams. ' Hopefully I 'll have some major improvement and get back in there next week. ' <p> Anderson back to earth <p> With Davis out of the lineup, the Broncos once again called in the Marine. Only this time, rookie running back Mike Anderson did not experience the success he had during his first two games. <p> Anderson was held to 85 yards rushing - 74 less than he averaged during his first two starts - and was denied the chance of becoming the first player in NFL history to rush for more than 100 yards in each of his first three starts. <p> ' That 's not a big deal, ' Anderson said. ' The biggest disappointment is not winning. It 's going to bother me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans how to adjust to this. ' <p> Gonzalez ' toasts ' Romo <p> It took Bill Romanowski more than three hours to finally catch up with Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez. By then, it was too late. Gonzalez, shoved and slapped by Denver 's rambunctious linebacker last year, caught 10 passes for 127 yards - both career highs. Romanowski was hardly a factor and he approached Gonzalez afterward to resume their rivalry. <p> ' He said, ' What 's up? You do n't want to have a drink with me? " Gonzalez said. ' I told him, ' As soon as you apologize to me for hitting me in my face five times, then I 'll go have a drink with you. Until then, I 'm not doing it. ' ' <p> No apology was forthcoming, but Chiefs fans were no doubt raising their glasses to toast Gonzalez after his career day. Statistics are for losers <p> With eight catches for 134 yards, Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Now having 282 career catches, Smith passed Mark Jackson and set his sights on Haven Moses at No. 6 in the Broncos ' record book. With 4,213 receiving yards, Smith passed Al Denson and took aim at Rick Upchurch, whose 4,396 yards rank eighth in club history. But after committing a crucial fourth-quarter turnover, Smith does n't care. ' I do n't care about any numbers, except for wins and losses, ' he said. Whoa, Thunder <p> After the Broncos ' first touchdown, backup safety Bracy Walker was minding his own business, reporting for work on the Chiefs ' kickoff return team - when he almost was run over by Thunder, the charging Broncos mascot. Walker was not a happy camper at the time, though he laughed about it after the game. <p> Let 's put it this way : That collision would have been the hit of the game. ' I 'm just trying to do my job, and this horse comes out of nowhere! ' Walker said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton? That would have been like getting hit by a car! You ever seen the cartoon where the lady is about to get hit by the train, the look on her face? I kind of felt like that. I mean, it was close! So I 'm yelling( at the Denver bench), ' You have to get this horse off the field! " Was that exactly what Walker said? ' Well, not exactly, ' he said. ' I try to keep a clean mouth here. ' When the going gets tough Forget the red zone. The Broncos had trouble moving the football Sunday on the serious side of the 50 yard line. On 32 plays in Chiefs territory, Denver averaged a paltry 3 yards per snap. By comparison, the Kansas City offense averaged 7.2 yards per play in Broncos territory. Two-point or not two-point <p> Funny how coaches who go by the book, and go for two points early in the game, usually seem to need that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Broncos on Sunday. After cornerback Ray Crockett intercepted an Elvis Grbac pass and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown with 6:40 left in the second quarter, Denver coach Mike Shanahan opted to go for two points. The conversion failed and Denver led 12-7. The point would have come in handy during a one-point loss. ' Once you make that decision, you live with it, ' Shanahan said. ' You ca n't predict what will happen. ' But had the Broncos scored the extra point, the Chiefs would not have gone for a two-point conversion in the fourth quarter that they failed to convert. They would have opted for the extra point that still would have given the 2-2 team a one-point lead. Chiefs wear lucky pants <p> The Chiefs wore red pants Sunday for the first time since 1988. ' How ' bout them red pants? ' asked Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham. ' That 's something I 've had in mind since the first day I got the job. The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played here. I respect them immensely. The( Willie) Laniers, Buck Buchanan, Len Dawson - I guess I have to give him credit, too. When I got the job, I was hesitant about asking, but after my first season at the league meetings, I asked. ' Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt told Cunningham he would think about it. ' He said, ' If Gun thinks it 's going to bring them luck, we 'll do it, " Cunningham said. ' Today was the first day, and now they 'll want to wear them every day. ' Burns is back <p> The Broncos re-signed Keith Burns last week to improve their special teams performance. Burns helped Sunday, but the boost he provided was as much emotional as physical. Before the opening kickoff, Burns reacquainted himself with the fans in the South Stands, imploring them to make as much noise as possible. Then Burns went out and made one special tackle. ' It was a great feeling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play, ' Burns said. ' It felt like I never left. But it is n't about me. It 's about the team. ' The Broncos ' special teams made more mistakes Sunday against the Chiefs. Three of Denver 's six penalties were assessed to the special teams. Chiefs do it again <p> Just as the Broncos have dominated the Raiders, the Chiefs have the upper hand on the Broncos. During Shanahan 's tenure as Broncos coach, Kansas City is the only team to beat Shanahan three times at Mile High Stadium. The Chiefs beat him in 1995, in ' 99 and again Sunday. ' They kept on fighting and they got it done, ' Shanahan said of the Chiefs. ' We have to put this behind us and get ready for the next round. ' Games of the century <p> Sunday 's game marked the 600th game in each franchise 's history, and each team had been 4-1 in previous ' century ' games. Denver had won its 200th, 300th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100th, 300th, 400th and 500th game. The Chiefs ' only century game loss was to Denver in their 200th game. <p> Chiefs ' win emotional <p> In the wake of the Chiefs ' 0-2 start and Cunningham 's brief contemplation of resigning after the opening loss to Indianapolis, the victory at Mile High was extraordinarily emotional for Kansas City. Cunningham was embraced by team president Carl Peterson as they walked off the field together. Then the celebration in the dressing room got even more physical. <p> ' I 've been beat up twice in my life - once by Brian Washington after we clinched the AFC West by beating the Raiders, and now, ' Cunningham said. ' I just got the( hell) kicked out of me by( center) Tim Grunhard. ' <p> Cunningham even got emotional about his last appearance at Mile High Stadium. <p> ' It 's the battle with two coaches on that staff, and that 's been going on since 1985, ' said Cunningham, who also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( offensive line coach) Alex Gibbs are two of my favorite people in the business They are very close friends of mine. <p> ' You wonder how much emotion you spend in this game about winning. On the sideline, I enjoy watching the players, and then I have to take the walk out to the middle of the field. I have all the respect in the world for Mike and his program. And to be able to beat him, it 's not always as happy as it seems. ' <p> Going down to the wire <p> Coming into Sunday 's game, 18 of the past 21 games between the Broncos and Chiefs were won by the team that scored last, including nine straight and 12 of the past 13. That trend grew stronger Sunday when the Chiefs won the game on a fourth-quarter touchdown and scored the game 's final points. <p> - Mark Kiszla, Terry Frei, <p> Patrick Saunders and The Associated <p> Press contributed to this report @p#
