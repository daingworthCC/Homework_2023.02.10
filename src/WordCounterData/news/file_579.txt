4131841 The topic was how his Texas defense performed in the Alamo Bowl, and after the 31-27 victory over Oregon State, Manny Diaz was speaking strictly from his perspective as coordinator of perhaps the most maligned defensive unit in school history. " It will be very important for us to understand, by all means, that we have not fixed all our issues and we have not arrived, " Diaz said. " There 's no '( being) back. ' There 's no ' Everything is great. ' " All we talked about( after the game) was this being a step leading into what is a very, very important offseason in this football program. " As it is for the defense, so it is for the entire team in what will be Mack Brown 's 16th, and arguably most important, season as head coach. Since 2010 's disastrous 5-7 crash, Brown has been rebuilding the program that has made him Texas ' second-winningest coach of all time. The process has been too slow for some fans - an 8-5 mark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't horrendous records, but they also are not the standard that Brown has established in his tenure. The Longhorns have pointed to 2013 as a season when they could return to national prominence. For one thing, it will be an older team, unlike the 2012 squad, which had only six seniors logging significant playing time. For another, the 2011 recruiting class, which ranked third nationally, should have more members ready to make impacts. Of course, that class includes 13 players who already have made notable contributions. " I think in our process to move forward, we 're about back to where we can compete at the highest level, " Brown said the day before the Dec. 29 bowl game. " I think we 're making tremendous progress. Not all of it is visible, and that 's something that 's very difficult for Texas fans who have seen us be so good. " In 2013, improvement in certain critical areas must be much more visible - not only to placate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the highest levels that Brown envisions. Here are three areas to watch : Offense : Will the quarterback picture stabilize? In his first full season as a starter, sophomore David Ash made a quantum leap forward from his rugged baptism as a freshman - for the most part. But it 's hard to ignore the fact that in the games where Ash struggled - Oklahoma, Kansas, TCU - there was no recovery. One encouraging aspect against Oregon State involved Ash, and the offense as a whole, getting off to a wobbly start. In the past, that could have signaled the appearance of Case McCoy. But with McCoy unavailable after being suspended, coaches had no choice but to stick with Ash. He rewarded them by completing 14 of 20 passes in the second half for 188 yards and two touchdowns in rallying UT from a 10-point deficit. He also rushed for another TD. It will be interesting to see what Major Applewhite, in his new role as quarterbacks coach and play-calling coordinator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the leadership department. It also will be interesting to see what happens with the other quarterbacks on the roster. McCoy 's future is uncertain. No other quarterback who 'll be on the roster - redshirt freshmen Connor Brewer and Jalen Overstreet, and true freshman Tyrone Swoopes, a midterm enrollee - has taken a snap in a college game. Of course, everything offensively is predicated on improvement by the line, which returns all starters. That 's especially true in run blocking if Texas is to maximize the considerable talents of backs Johnathan Gray, Malcolm Brown, Joe Bergeron and Daje Johnson. Defense : Can the Longhorns rebound? Yes, Diaz 's group closed the year in spectacular fashion - an Alamo Bowl-record 10 sacks, 4 1/2 by senior end Alex Okafor, and three takeaways. But that does n't disguise the unalterable fact that this unit, expected to be solid before the season, wound up allowing more yards than any other defense in Texas history. The Longhorns surrendered 404.2 yards per game, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 29.2 points given up per game was third-highest in school history. Diaz, under intense fire, must find a cure for poor tackling and players regularly being out of position, especially up the middle, where tackles and linebackers were repeatedly gashed. He also must find replacements for Okafor and safety Kenny Vaccaro, the only seniors on the defensive two-deep and the unquestioned leaders of the unit. Jackson Jeffcoat, who missed the final seven games with a pectoral injury, should join Cedric Reed and Reggie Wilson to make a good rotation at end. At safety, it 's not so clear. Quandre Diggs, a two-year starter at corner, got work at safety in bowl prep and might make the move. After big sophomore years, Carrington Byndom and Adrian Phillips struggled for most of 2012 but came on late. Coaches are high on young defensive backs Josh Turner and Duke Thomas. The linebackers, whom Diaz coaches, also struggled most of the year, along with most of a tackle rotation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hicks, whose season ended in the third game with an injury. His status is unclear because he also was suspended by Brown at the bowl game. Young linebackers Kendall Thompson, Tevin Jackson, Steve Edmond and Peter Jinkens showed flashes but lacked consistency. Ditto for the five-man tackle rotation, in which all players will return. Special teams : Will reliable kickers be found? Punter Alex King, a grad school transfer from Duke, made the most of his lone season, averaging 45.3 yards per kick. He must be replaced, though. It was n't so pretty at place-kicker, where Nick Jordan( 9 of 15) and Anthony Fera( 2 of 4), combined to make just 58 percent of their attempts. Bottom line There 's potential, but will it be realized? The early schedule is no cakewalk. After opening with New Mexico State, Texas will visit Brigham Young, host Mississippi and then begin Big 12 play against defending champion Kansas State. The jury is likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to Oklahoma, the last two by an average score of 59-19, the Longhorns know the outcome in the Red River Rivalry probably will define the season, not to mention the future of Brown 's program.
