3057741 <p> SAN ANTONIO - As the Pistons attempt to come back in the NBA Finals against the Spurs tonight, it is important to remember they are the champions. <p> If you do n't believe this, you could check out the championship belts they walk around with, which is their right because they are the champions, which they earned by winning the championship. <p> And despite being down 1-0 to the Spurs, like it or not, and the Pistons know you do n't like it, they are the champions. <p> " You all do n't know that, " Chauncey Billups scolded Saturday. " You just know the Lakers lost. That 's the whole thing last year. It was n't that we won, it was that the Lakers lost. We take a lot of pride in that. We take a whole lot of pride in that. <p> " I personally do n't do that. I do n't sit up here every day saying we 're the champs, I 'm this, I 'm that. But I do n't mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's not all they do. The Pistons seem to have proved that Rasheed Wallace 's self-persecution complex is contagious. <p> These Pistons constantly think the officials are out to get them. They moan about a lack of public respect and that they were never appreciated. <p> Pistons coach Larry Brown even went so far as to be outraged that anyone would suggest he spoke with another team about a position even though he knew he had. <p> It is all such a waste. The Pistons are a pleasure to watch, more so when one looks at the qualities that make them excel, that made them champions. The Pistons ' selfless offensive style and tough defense would seem to bring the values fans say they want. <p> But no one discounted their accomplishments. No one even called them on how pretentious all that " right way " stuff was. <p> They might have been self-righteous, but were celebrated for being the antithesis of the self-absorbed Lakers. <p> Since then, the Pistons have become such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned themselves into champions of petulance. <p> " I do n't care what none of you cats think, " said Wallace, ever the charmer. " Half of you are bandwagon, and the other half got the Spurs winning anyway, so it do n't matter to us. " <p> Wallace thinks no one in the 1,400-member media contingent believes in the Pistons. He 's not alone in this regard. <p> " In the last series, everybody thought we had no chance against the Heat, " Billups said. " We like to hear that. That fuels that fire, we play with that chip on our shoulder when we hear that stuff. So we want to remind y'all that we are the champs, we did win the championship in case y'all forgot. " <p> It 's no wonder then that the Pistons feel the need to wear championship rings the size of hood ornaments and carry championship belts the size of a car hood to constantly remind of their accomplishments. <p> They are, after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record for going from great to grating in one season. <p> Pick a team, already <p> Since he finally admitted he did talk casually with the Cavaliers about becoming team president, Larry Brown also has insisted he would not coach any team but the Pistons and that he would absolutely remain a coach if his health allows. <p> Complications from his hip replacement surgery are making the physically demanding job of coaching much more challenging. <p> But if Brown can coach, win or lose in the Finals, it might be time to revise that nowhere-but-Detroit plan. <p> Phil Jackson has said his decision will come in the next few days, but he could be moved to pass on reviving the Lakers because taking the job would mean no one will spend the next year asking if he will return to coaching. <p> Brown will have given the Pistons two great seasons. The Lakers ' roster can not compare, but he would improve them. He always does. <p> The Pistons could move past the uncertainty Brown always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is his goal, leave another team better than he found it. And Jackson can circle above over another job for a while. <p> McDyess accepts new role <p> Antonio McDyess was going to be one of the league 's great stars. He was young and physically gifted. When he threw a ball at the ceiling at the Westside Tennis Club gym, the joke was that he jumped that high, 50 feet or so from the floor, and punched it. <p> Then that explosion was gone, a victim to three knee surgeries in 19 months. If McDyess could not be the player he was, he did not want to play at all. <p> " The doctor kept trying to put it in my head, I was going to be back 100 percent, " McDyess said. " I kept trusting that and trusting that. After the third( operation) and the third rehab, I was still counting on that. After I got on the floor, that was the worst. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be. That 's when I really wanted to retire.... I do n't want to be that back burner player. " <p> But McDyess made his peace with what he was, a strong, solid power forward. Chauncey Billups helped convince him that with the Pistons he could win a championship. Now he seems incapable of losing his smile. <p> " I could n't ask for anything better than where I 'm at now, coming off the bench and the guys have a lot of confidence in me when I step out on the court, " McDyess said. " I definitely realize I do what my legs, what my body allows me to do. I accept that. If I can go around a player, I go around him. I 'm not ever going to be the player I once was, jumping, dunking, running the floor real fast, being real physical. I just put it in my head, I have to play smarter, be another type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity in hiring a coach seems to point to Spurs coach P.J. Carlesimo. Paul Silas, whom they also have interviewed, is available. If the Timberwolves were going in that direction, it would seem they would have by now. <p> But with the Timberwolves and Knicks honoring their promise to stay out of the way while Carlesimo works in the Finals, Carlesimo can not help but wonder if the lack of conversation represents diminishing interest. <p> " They both said that they are not going to try to interfere with what( I am) doing, " Carlesimo said of the Knicks and Timberwolves. " Obviously, when people are reaching out more often and you 're talking to them more often you feel better. I felt better a couple weeks ago than I do now. <p> " I would n't say I 'm eager. I 'm glad I got an opportunity to talk to two teams. <p> " I hope when the playoffs are over, I 'll talk to one or both. I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hype <p> It 's a good thing the NBA has stuffed concerts and dancers and gigantic championship trophies all over the NBA Finals because before the Finals became entertainment extravaganzas with a basketball game mixed in, there was no excitement, no buzz for the event. <p> Back in those dark days, no one nervously crossed their fingers when Willis Reed limped to the court, no one roared when the Celtics and Lakers battled, no one held their breath when Michael Jordan went up for his last Bulls jump shot. <p> Not to worry, though. Kelly Clarkson will sing tonight so people will know the Finals are a really big deal. <p> <p> Signs pointing to a lockout <p> THE assumption at the Chicago pre-draft camp and in San Antonio at the Finals has been that there will be a lockout. <p> " That 's the understanding, " one team official said. " It 's being assumed. The sides do n't seem far apart, but we 're not hearing about any movement. " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal, this one will not bring a new system. The players ' association was willing to extend it unchanged. The owners ' priorities - beginning with a reduction in the length of contracts and maximum raises in exchange for a greater guaranteed share of the revenue - do not represent sweeping changes. <p> The sides, if pressed, could get together quickly. But as they posture their way through June, there seems to be little pressure to make a deal by July. <p> NOTES : Jonathan Feigen covers the Rockets and the NBA for the Chronicle. **25;1488;TOOLONG
