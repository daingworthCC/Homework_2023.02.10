3028541 <p> Stuff is getting cheaper. <p> Not just because of weekend sales. Or temporary promotions. But honest-to-goodness price cuts. <p> All major brand cereal makers have lowered prices the past few months. So have several luxury car makers and personal computer makers. Nothing to sneeze at -- even facial tissue prices are dropping fast. <p> No longer is a strong economy an easy excuse for raising prices. Competition -- domestically and globally -- is too great. The perceived difference between major brands and store brands is too small. And technological improvements have cut manufacturing costs, eliminating a prime justification for higher prices. <p> " Competition is coming from so many different angles that any company sitting fat and happy will get killed in this economy, " says Joe Wilke, executive vice president of The Bases Group, a marketing consultant. " The rallying cry of American industry is to drive unnecessary costs out of the system and return them to the consumers. " <p> American shoppers will save at least $ 17 billion over the next three years as a result of price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toilet paper, estimates Meridian Consulting Group, a marketing consultancy. The trend is unmistakable : <p> -- Post Raisin Bran has dropped to $ 2.99 from $ 4.13 for a 20-ounce box. <p> -- Cheer, Era, Gain and Tide detergents will be an average 6.5% cheaper, effective Oct. 14. <p> -- Bounty paper towel prices have been cut an average 4.8% from last year. <p> -- Sprint 's off-peak, long-distance telephone calls that averaged 15.4 cents a minute two years ago now cost 10 cents a minute. <p> -- Burger King 's Whopper -- priced at 99 cents as an occasional promotion in some cities -- will remain at that price in some highly competitive cities, including Tampa, Phoenix and San Diego. <p> -- Toyota is cutting the base price of its redesigned 1997 Camry by $ 610. Its top-of-the-line XLE with a <p> V-6 engine will be priced $ 1,745 less than a comparably equipped ' 96. <p> Why the price cuts? Industry experts say there is just one sure formula for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumers will no longer pay more than a product 's worth, " says Jeffrey Hill, managing director of Meridian Consulting Group. " Brand loyalty today means you stick with a brand only until you find a better deal. " <p> Some predict lower prices will extend to virtually every product category in drugstores and supermarkets. <p> " This may be a consumer 's dream, " says Michael Silverstein, senior vice president of marketing consultant Boston Consulting Group. " But it 's a plague for anybody on the business side. " <p> From cereals to cars, many products that once routinely went up in price each year are instead heading down. The trend has been gaining momentum for several years. <p> In the face of an economy that many experts say is going gangbusters, price cuts might not seem to make much sense. <p> After all, in good economic times, prices often tend to go up -- not down -- partially because of inflation and partially because consumers are in more of a spending mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic times. Consumer confidence hit a six-year high in August. The nation 's unemployment rate plunged to a seven-year low of 5.1% last month. And July factory orders zoomed 1.8% to the highest level on record. Meanwhile, the consumer price index has been rising less than 3% annually since 1992. <p> Of course, not all prices are coming down. Airlines, for example, raised fares about 2.5% last week, the second price increase in a month. And most medical-related costs still are on the rise. <p> But economists say the trend toward lower prices is very real. It 's a new economic world. <p> Some say the consumer product giants are simply responding to the price pressures from makers of private-label goods. Sales of private label and store-brand products exceeded $ 37 billion the past year, estimates John Pierce, senior editor of the trade magazine, Private Label. That 's a hefty increase of 5.2% from the year before, he says. <p> " Every category with a strong private-label presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill. <p> That 's one big reason consumer-product giants such as Procter &; Gamble, Unilever and Kimberly-Clark reduced prices on some of their most popular consumer goods. <p> Some trace the price-slashing trend to the late 1980s, when fast-food giant Taco Bell began slashing menu prices. All major fast-food rivals eventually followed suit. <p> But bigger price-cutting tremors were felt in 1992, when Procter &; Gamble started to kill its marginal brands, cut product lines and shave prices. Since then, P &G; spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore says, the company has saved consumers about $ 2 billion by lowering its overall prices domestically by 6%. <p> P &G; took aggressive moves to cut costs internally. It consolidated suppliers. And it eliminated dozens of slow-selling items. Its number of product variations fell to 2,200 this year from a peak of 3,300 in 1991. <p> P &G; also cut way back on costly promotions like couponing. Right now, it 's testing a program in Rochester, N.Y., that, if adopted nationally, could eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive were forced to follow. But it did n't stop there. An economic wave began to take shape that cut across American industries. Experts say this wave has a long way to go before cresting. <p> " It 's a different mind-set now, " says Katherine Kobe, vice-president of the Joel Popkin &; Co. forecasting firm in Washington. " You just have to be prepared to compete, be the low-price producer. " <p> Philip Morris sent unexpected smoke signals through the tobacco industry in April 1993, when it suddenly dropped the price of its premium cigarette brands -- including the world 's top-selling brand, Marlboro -- by 40 cents a pack. <p> Reason : Value-conscious consumers were leaving Marlboro in droves. Some generic brands were selling for $ 1 less a pack than Marlboro. Executives at Philip Morris feared the brand would have lost five market share points in 1993 if prices were not cut substantially. " For the first time ever, Marlboro was losing market share to the price value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993, Marlboro has added nearly 10 market share points. Although it has twice increased cigarette prices, each was limited to the cost of inflation -- or about 3 cents a pack. <p> After years of rising prices, this reality finally hit the cereal aisles. " Consumers were fed up with the high prices on the shelf, " says Mark Leckie, president of Post Cereal, a unit of Philip Morris. " They learned to only buy cereal on sale. " <p> Post lowered cereal prices 20% across the board in April. Kellogg quickly lowered many cereal prices, too. General Mills, which previously lowered prices on many cereal brands in 1995, again lowered prices after the action by Post. <p> Some consumer product makers have bucked the trend. But they probably wo n't for much longer, experts say. Among them, the makers of health and beauty-care products are likely to soon feel the pinch from private-label makers. <p> " In my 22-year career, I 've never seen anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every brand. Every price is under review. And that 's the way it should be. " <p> Contributing : Del Jones <p> As marketers try to gain market share, consumers are getting a break on everything from laundry detergent to luxury cars.
