" asked Samartino, stepping into a stream of sunshine pouring through the classroom window. <p> But Samartino was n't the only one seeing her shadow on Thursday morning, with 15 of the 20 kindergartners in her classroom correctly predicting that Punxsutawney Phil would indeed see his shadow on Gobbler 's Knob, some 500 miles away in Pennsylvania. As a result, the groundhog predicted six more weeks of winter. <p> The students had been prepped for the day with learning activities related to groundhogs. <p> But Samartino 's Groundhog Day celebration also trod on more sophisticated academic terrain ; for example, asking the youngsters to use their critical thinking skills to differentiate fiction from nonfiction. <p> " The Groundhog Day story is fiction, because it 's only a legend, " one student said, leading Samartino to explain that the tradition was started by farmers in the 19th century who were searching for a sign telling them when to plant their crops. <p> Groundhog Day <p> Karen Ann Cullotta / Pioneer Press <p> Windsor Elementary School kindergartners celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not Punxsutawney Phil would see his shadow. <p> Windsor Elementary School kindergartners celebrated Groundhog Day in Arlington Heights by making predictions about whether or not Punxsutawney Phil would see his shadow.( Karen Ann Cullotta / Pioneer Press) <p> " About 131 years ago, a groundhog like Phil was coming out and helping them make predictions, because back then, they did n't have the computers and other scientific equipment that we use today to know what the weather is going to be like, " Samartino said. " They could n't just check their iPhone or turn on the computer like we do, so the groundhog 's shadow was one way for them to guess. " <p> Across town at Patton Elementary School, second-grade students in Jean McLoone 's class designed devices from cardboard, tape and clay to prevent a groundhog from seeing its shadow, and as legend has it, thereby ensuring spring would arrive six weeks early. <p> " I like Groundhog Day, because it 's really exciting, " said second-grader Hailey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased supplies for the project with $10 worth of play money. <p> " Groundhog Day gets me pumped, because I do n't want him to see his shadow, and I want it to be spring, " Hailey said. <p> Groundhog Day <p> Karen Ann Cullotta / Pioneer Press <p> Windsor Elementary School kindergartners celebrated Groundhog Day in Arlington Heights by making predictions about whether or not Punxsutawney Phil would see his shadow. <p> Windsor Elementary School kindergartners celebrated Groundhog Day in Arlington Heights by making predictions about whether or not Punxsutawney Phil would see his shadow.( Karen Ann Cullotta / Pioneer Press) <p> McLoone said the interactive, hands-on activity provided a perfect opportunity for her students to flex their skills in the arenas of STEAM -- also known as science, technology, engineering, arts and math. <p> " Some students who might not do as well with a traditional classroom assignment shine in this environment, " McLoone said.
