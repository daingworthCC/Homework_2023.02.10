3047641 <p> The White House appeared to be on the verge of victory last night as the House of Representatives prepared to vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement. <p> Senior administration officials said they were just a handful of votes shy of the 218 they need to secure passage of the agreement, and they confidently predicted that they will have the votes in time for today 's vote. <p> The House is expected to vote on the pact at 6 p.m. PST after at least eight hours of floor debate. <p> The Senate is expected to ratify the pact if it passes in the House. <p> The vote count was so close yesterday that partisans on both sides agreed that the outcome will not be settled by the time the House begins its floor debate, an exercise that is usually little more than a scripted performance for television cameras. <p> " If we do everything right between now and the vote... we 're going to win this, " said Representative Robert Matsui, D-Sacramento, who is shepherding the agreement through the House. " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to win. " <p> An Associated Press survey of the 434 members of the House( there is one vacancy) showed that 209 support the pact and eight others are likely to do so. In contrast, 183 members oppose the pact and 14 said they were leaning against it. Twenty members had yet to declare. <p> The new converts included four members of the California delegation. Among them were Republican Bill Baker of Danville and Democrat Sam Farr of Monterey. <p> The political drama culminates a three-year effort that began under President George Bush to encourage trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada. If approved, NAFTA would eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the three nations over the next 15 years. <p> Opponents, who warn that millions of American jobs are at stake, had insisted for weeks that they had enough votes to kill the pact. Yesterday, they said they were " doing extremely well. " <p> But on a day when the Capitol was filled with Mexican television crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NAFTA partisans seeking appointments with members of Congress, the momentum was clearly with NAFTA supporters, who picked up 24 votes yesterday. <p> The White House was brimming with confidence after President Clinton spent another day in private meetings and telephone conversations applying pressure to wavering lawmakers. <p> " We 've made good progress, and all I can tell you is that we expect to have 218 votes tomorrow, " said White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers. <p> One of the White House 's top vote counters, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said the president is within " single digits " of securing the 218 votes. <p> STATEMENT TO GOVERNORS <p> Clinton laid out his basic argument for the agreement in a brief statement to a group of 15 pro- NAFTA governors. <p> " No one has seriously advanced the proposition that the United States can grow jobs and raise incomes -- our most urgent economic priority -- without having more customers for our products and services, " Clinton said from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether we 're going to try to hold on to yesterday 's economy or embrace tomorrow 's economy. " <p> Responding to AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland 's criticism that he had " abdicated the leadership of the Democratic Party " by pledging to defend Republicans on the issue, Clinton said : <p> " My job is to try to lead the United States and to try to help this country move forward and to do what I think is right to get that done. I do not believe we can grow this economy without expanding our trade. I 'm doing the job that the people elected me to do, to try to expand the economy. " <p> The movement in favor of the trade agreement was evident in California, where four members of the House -- Baker and Farr, as well as Jay Kim, R-Ontario, and Carlos Moorhead, R-Glendale -- announced their support. <p> The California delegation, which had been evenly split on the issue for weeks, is now solidly behind the pact. Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the agreement, 20 oppose it, and three have yet to declare a position, according to a Chronicle survey. <p> " To a high-tech, service-oriented area like ours, businesses and exports stimulated by NAFTA 's reduction in trade barriers will foster local job creation, " said Baker, who noted that a United Parcel Service terminal in San Ramon stands to benefit greatly from the agreement. <p> The pro-NAFTA votes were secured after a frenzy of deal making and private phone conversations, although administration officials insisted that the deals will not cost the Treasury any money. <p> PRISONER EXCHANGE <p> In order to secure Kim 's vote, the White House expedited a prisoner exchange program with Mexico to encourage thousands of illegal immigrants, convicted of crimes and now serving sentences in U.S. jails, to be voluntarily transfered to halfway houses in Mexico. <p> Although the program, which could begin as soon as next month, is expected to make only a small dent in the $ 450 million a year California spends on convicted immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pivotal factor in gaining his support, and he called the trade agreement " a golden opportunity for the United States to address the serious issue of illegal immigration. " <p> Farr, who had been considered a " no " vote until yesterday afternoon, changed his mind after two calls from Clinton. <p> Meanwhile, Mickey Kantor, the administration 's trade representative, worked with Florida lawmakers over terms to shield the state 's tomato growers from damage in the event Mexico violates export standards. <p> WHIP 'S STATEMENT <p> Frustrated by the White House 's ability to broker such deals, Representative David Bonior, the House Democratic whip and NAFTA 's most active opponent, said : " This issue is still too important to working families in this country to be dealt with in the way that the administration is dealing with it. <p> " I shudder to think what it will take to get votes to pass a decent health care bill next year, " he said. <p> NAFTA TIMETABLE <p> -- House convenes : 6 a.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. PST. <p> * Length of debate : Officially, eight hours.
