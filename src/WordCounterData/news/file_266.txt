3047741 <p> THE STORY OF BOP 'S NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY <p> Editor -- As an international businessman and one of the few longtime American residents in Bophuthatswana, I find your characterization of a " victory for... a multiracial, democratic South Africa over the destructive forces of separatism, despotism and tribal division "( Chronicle editorial, March 17) distorts reality. <p> No one denies that South Africa designed the homelands as dumping grounds for its black populations. But Bophuthatswana 's leaders seized independence from South Africa in December 1977 as a chance to escape from its apartheid hell and to shape their own destiny. They were by no means puppets of South Africa. <p> Upon independence 16 years ago, Bop immediately abolished apartheid and has successfully created the subcontinent 's first truly non-racial state. The new country 's economy was so powerful that two all-white South African towns on its borders -- Makikeng and Thaba N'Chu -- in 1979 and 1982 even voted themselves out of apartheid South Africa and into Bop 's non-racial democracy. <p> This often-called " bastion of apartheid " also lured hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted with their feet to partake in Bophuthatswana 's mostly peaceful educational and economic transformation. <p> Democratically-elected President Mangope and his government forged from an inheritance of virtually nothing one of Africa 's most successful and dynamic infrastructures and economies. <p> Bop 's economy was built on mining ; tourism through casino resorts and holiday hotels ; overseas and South African investment ; and a capitalism that bloomed black African entrepreneurs and managers on a large scale. Also, by establishing southern Africa 's first all-race social security, unemployment insurance and pension systems for which I worked, Bop 's investment portfolio from this source alone rose to over $ 1 billion. <p> Bophuthatswana 's economic miracle was largely achieved with self-generated capital ; unlike other " ' homelands, " South African foreign aid never amounted to more than 7 to 20 percent of Bop 's annual budgets, a far smaller proportion than most developing countries '. <p> It will take at least 16 years for the ANC to create in South Africa a fraction of what it helped destroy in Bop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> THE WORLD-TO-COME <p> Editor -- Re Jon Stewart 's foreign policy " briefing "( Chronicle, March 14), headlined " U.S. Indecision Contributing to World 's Growing Disarray, " and focusing on our lack of an overarching policy guideline for the post-Cold War world, let me suggest it 's not as difficult as the so-called experts suggest. <p> Why not simply ask ourselves, " What kind of world do we want to be living in 50 years from now? " And then, once we 've settled this " vision thing, " let 's patiently go about doing what 's needed to create that kind of world, to the best of our ability, prioritizing along the way, and letting the chips fall wherever in the process. <p> Of course, if we can not agree( at our policymaker level) on what kind of world we are hoping to inhabit, what chance will we have of producing it, or even recognizing it if it should come about without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open-ended policy, the end result of which was, somehow or other, to be the collapse of the Communist expansionist dynamic. It permitted us to mobilize great forces, and obtain international collaboration, in its attainment. Surely a more positive vision of a world-to-come could elicit similar forces around this scattered and bedeviled globe. With it, we could place our possible policy and military adventures in a meaningful framework, within which evaluation of costs versus results would become feasible. <p> Does n't sound too tough to me. Why should it to people paid well to do the job? <p> CLARK TINCH CAMERON <p> San Jose <p>. <p> POLITICAL GOALS <p> Editor -- How to word correctly what is going on in Washington at this time. Today, party politics are, in plain and simple words, selfish. <p> The real good of humanity, the country, is not the goal of the average politician in either group, for usually their own selfish ambition and the desire to preserve a certain political ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their efforts. <p> RON LOWE <p> Nevada City <p>. <p> WHITEWATER 'S ' BENEFITS ' <p> Editor -- Overlooked, almost as if by design, by the decidedly pro- liberal media are two benefits certain to accrue to the American people from the ongoing " Whitewater Affair. " <p> The Clinton administration will become so crippled by having to defend itself against charges involving conflict of interest and other wrongdoings that it will be limited to this single, four-year term. <p> Moreover, all future first ladies -- rather than becoming unelected " co-presidents " -- will resume their more traditional roles : White House hostess, mistress and redecorator and involvement in public charities and fund-raisers. <p> THOMAS M. EDWARDS <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> THREE-STRIKES MESS <p> Editor -- Your editorial, which appeared in the Sunday Punch of March 13, as well as earlier ones you have written, criticizing the policies represented by the " three strikes and you 're out " campaign are gratifying to see. I hope, in the months ahead, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the public 's attention to the folly of these measures. We welcome your focus on the irresponsibility of legislators who vote for laws that they know are unwork able. In this instance, lawmakers have repeatedly voted for bills that contradict each other -- refusing to choose between them for fear someone would think they were " soft on crime. " <p> You continue to make one mistake, however, which needs to be corrected. The initiative which will appear on the November ballot, and the Jones bill, which was signed into law, do not require felonies which count as " strikes " to be violent. They can be " violent " or " serious " and the language is so broad that almost any felony would qualify. car theft, purse snatching, being involved with someone else in a crime, who uses a gun. All of these crimes can now be expected to go to trial, since an offender will be afraid to plead guilty to a crime that might result in a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, will come to a grinding halt. Is this really the kind of public policy we want, especially knowing that longer prison sentences do not reduce crime rates? <p> LAURA MAGNANI <p> American Friends <p> Service Committee <p> Oakland <p>. <p> CHOICES FOR KIDS <p> Editor -- Re : state Department of Education 's censorship of Alice Walker 's literary contributions. <p> I 've had time to read only one of the three stories banned, then unbanned by my state Department of Education. Like most of my colleagues, I have spent the last several weeks planning further cuts and the dismantling of programs. But a friend of mine loaned me a copy of Alice Walker 's book, " Love and Trouble, " in which " Roselily " appeared. <p> Impressed by the number and complexity of themes running through a four-page story, I used it and the decision to censor it to train my staff about CLAS standards and holistic scoring. We each read the story and wrote short essays taking positions on the move by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers to be read and scored by other teachers and administrators -- a difficult task for a 45-minute period. <p> Ironically, " Roselily 's " very examination of issues related to a middle-age first marriage of a mother of four to a man of a different religion must have been as threatening to traditionalists as the issues over which she ruminated. Purportedly a simple woman, the persona could not hold back conflicting, complex strands of considerations as she prepared to recite her marriage vows to a man who loved her and would care for her, but at the price of much of her freedom. <p> Perhaps the greatest tragedy of those who tried to ban this and other stories on the CLAS test is their fear that by allowing young people to see that we adults enter decisions, not single mindedly, but filled with conflicting values and emotions, the young people will be confused and lose their ways. Living in the shadow of absolutes does provide stability to the young, but it hardly prepares them to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as adults. <p> We can not protect children from facing the situational world each of us must negotiate. While we educators have the duty to assist in instilling lasting values such as social responsibility in children, we would be woefully remiss in failing to prepare them to weigh pros and cons of choices. We have all painfully learned that just saying, " No " just does n't work. <p> STEPHEN J. WATERMAN, Esq. <p> Superintendent <p> Brisbane School District
