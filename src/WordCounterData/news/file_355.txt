3060841 <p> Hell hath no fury like Al Pacino scorned. The descent into fire and brimstone territory happens within the first five minutes of this interview. <p> Question : As the devil in your new movie, you say that vanity is the best sin. Do you have any personal favorites? <p> Pacino gets that don't-mess-with-me Godfather face. His eyes go a little wild. " This is why I did n't want to come here today, " he snaps. <p> Then a wicked smile. It turns out that Pacino is just acting mad. And doing a hell of a job. <p> " I guess my favorite sin is the sin of omission, " he finally announces with a big grin. <p> Luckily we do n't have to forgive him because he does n't omit much on an 80-degree fall day at the Regency Hotel. Pacino, who arrives in a full-length leather trench coat, walks into the room and announces, " I 'm not wearing anything underneath. " <p> That would be true if you did n't count the black jeans and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " says the man who plays an adorable grim reaper in " Devil 's Advocate. " His devil runs a law firm, hangs out with Don King, and lip syncs to Frank Sinatra songs. He also tries to corrupt poor Keanu Reeves. " Do n't forget to mention that the devil also has a sense of humor, " says Pacino, who proves that he has one too. <p> Q. Mr. Pacino. <p> A. Al. <p> Q. Mr. Pacino. What is the last thing that the devil made you do? <p> A.( Laughing.) Take up smoking again.( He lights up.) Maybe the devil made me give up giving it up. You see I smoke these health cigarettes. They 're herbal. They smell like grass, but no. You know I was on Larry King and before I went on I smoked one. Everyone was sure it was something else. <p> Q. Did the idea of playing the devil scare you? <p> A. I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil. It 's an acting challenge, because where do you start? You do n't want to be all fire and brimstone. The devil has been around since the Dark Ages. He needs a few laughs. <p> Q. And who knew the devil was a Frank Sinatra fan? <p> A. Hey, that just came out and I 'm to blame, Frank. I was doing a goof. I was lip syncing to Frank as a way of preparing for a scene as the devil. I wanted to loosen Satan up a bit. Suddenly, everyone said, " You know, this should be in the movie. " <p> Q. How did you get in a devilish mood? <p> A. I read Dante. Paradise Lost, man, that was something. <p> Q. Do you think lawyers will think this is the final insult? Now they literally are portrayed as the devil. <p> A. I think it 's appropriate to set the film at a law firm. Lawyers are the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. This year is the 25th anniversary of the first " Godfather " film. Did you happen to catch the movie again? <p> A. You know what? I had never seen " The Godfather. " Once when I was very young, I paid to see the movie but I only stayed about five minutes. I was so nervous that I was out of there like a shot. So when this anniversary year rolled around, I finally saw the movie in New York. It was interesting to see the crowd 's reaction to it. They loved it. <p> Q. And what was your reaction? <p> A. It was like looking at an old photo of myself. You wonder. You just wonder. Finally I sat there and had to admit, " It is really a good movie. " But I could n't relate to that young guy up there. I look at " The Godfather " now like a painting that was done. It is not for me to say if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you go. If you 're strongly against what you did in your past or if you 're positive... neither is right. I guess you just try not to be too critical. <p> Q. Would you ever do another " Godfather "? Last time we spoke you said never. <p> A. Here is my answer now. I would do anything Francis Ford Coppola would be interested in doing. Even with " The Godfather, " I 'd be ready to do anything. I feel if Francis has a sense that we should do it, maybe we should do it. I trust him. <p> Q. Francis says he wants to do it. It 's just a matter of time and money. <p> A. And the right story. <p> Q. At this stage, do you still experience self-doubt? <p> A. It 's always the same thing with me. I always feel like I do n't know. I feel that the next thing will always be better. Maybe that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q. Then how does it feel when people call you a legend? <p> A. That 's hard to compute. Legend. What does it mean? I do n't view myself that way. When I hear it, it 's strange. I feel that way about other actors. Mostly I figure that when someone has been around for a while, people claim you 're a legend. Maybe this is a way people have of being gracious with me. <p> Q. You must intimidate the hell out of other actors. <p> A. There is an intimidation factor, but I try to immediately break that down. I worked with Lee Strasberg, the great guru of theater. When I met him, I was intimidated. Then we got into the scene and we were suddenly on this tightrope together. Up there the relationship becomes equal and mutual. That 's the way I work with people. I get rid of the myth. That 's fantasy. The reality is that I throw you the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who has never been on your team, but you can only dream? <p> A. Martin Scorsese. I do n't know why we have never worked together, but that 's my dream. <p> Q. If there is a message in " Devil 's Advocate, " it 's about the destructive power of ambition. Have you been guilty of that one, too? <p> A. Someone once asked David Mamet... I hate to quote him without his approval. But he said such a beautiful thing, so I 'm going out on a limb. Someone said, " David, you write all the time. You must be so ambitious. " David said, " No. It just beats thinking. " I kind of agree. I act a lot. It beats thinking. <p> Q. OK, the devil made us ask this last question. Later in life you have become a sex symbol for women. For instance, " Devil 's Adocate " ' is a pretty sexy movie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain that they wished Al Pacino and not Keanu Reeves had more love scenes. Any comment? <p> A.( Laughing. Well, it 's like what Lee Strasberg once said while looking out at the ocean. He was standing there on this beautiful beach. Everyone said, " Lee, look at this water. It 's fantastic. Why are you just standing here on the sand? " He said, " I love the water. I just do n't want to get involved. " That does n't answer your question, but just think about it for a moment. It 's quite devilish. <p> Distributed by Big Picture News Inc.
