4187641 <p> Maryland 's Bobby Gribin is checked by Navy 's DJ Plumer as he attempts a shot in the third quarter. The visiting Maryland Terrapins defeated the Navy Midshipmen, 8-1, in men 's NCAA lacrosse Saturday at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. <p> D.J. Plumer 's Patriot League Defensive Player of the Week honor affirmed his work for Navy men 's lacrosse. <p> The awarding of the Patriot League Defensive Player of the Week honor to Navy short-stick defensive midfielder D.J. Plumer was rare recognition for a position that often gets overlooked. <p> But the sophomore 's performance -- which included shutting out No. 17 Loyola Maryland junior midfielder Romar Dennis on five shots, grabbing five ground balls, causing one turnover, and notching an assist in Saturday 's 10-9 victory -- was affirmation of what coach Rick Sowell has seen all season. <p> " It 's been awfully good, " Sowell said Thursday of Plumer. "... He gets it. He understands the schemes, and he easily relates to any adjustment that we make out there. I was pleasantly surprised that a D-middie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Week this past week, but it certainly was well-deserved. " <p> Last spring, Plumer spent time on both ends of the field, registering two goals and one assist on offense and eight ground balls and four caused turnovers on defense. But with freshman Greyson Torain playing his way onto the first midfield, Plumer was asked to shift permanently to the defense. <p> " This year, we were n't sure going into the fall between Greyson and D.J., " Sowell said. " Even though they 're different athletes, they 're very similar in a lot of ways. They can play both ends of the field and are very comfortable at both of those positions. We were n't sure which one we were going to use more on the defensive end and which one we were going to use more on the offensive end. The way things unfolded throughout the fall, we felt that Greyson could give us a dynamic dodger on the offensive end and D.J. could give us that steady guy on the defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth in Division I in clearing at 91.1 percent( 112-of-123). They have completed... <p> No. 14 Navy 's average of 9.9 goals this spring is only slightly better than last season 's 9.8 rate, but the offense has had plenty of chances thanks to the team 's ability to clear the ball. <p> The Midshipmen( 5-2) rank fifth in Division I in clearing at 91.1 percent( 112-of-123). They have completed... <p>( Edward Lee) <p> Plumer 's progress has rounded out a defensive corps that ranks fourth in the nation after surrendering just 6.8 goals per game. That strength will be tested Saturday when Navy meets Lehigh( 5-2) and its No. 9 offense for a battle between two teams with 3-1 records in the Patriot League. <p> " We 've got to play really well, " Sowell said. " Lehigh is a really good team, well-coached. They score a lot of goals. They 're in the Top 10 in goals per game. So our defense is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one team that 's undefeated in the conference. So getting wins is important. But we still have three more league games afterward. So to use the word critical, it 's not life or death, but we 're going to do all we can to get our fourth league win. "
