5016141 <h> Municipal court consolidation in Cuyahoga County needs to be part of the agenda for Justice Center 's future : editorial <p> Updated February 17, 2019 at 11:34 AM ; Posted February 17, 2019 at 5:50 AM <p> With the future of the Cuyahoga County Justice Center, pictured in 2013, now being studied, the possible consolidation of Cuyahoga County 's 13 municipal courts into a unified county municipal court should be part of that discussion, writes the editorial board.( Marvin Fong, The Plain Dealer, File, 2013) <p> Inside Cuyahoga County, taxpayers support 13 separate municipal courts, including Cleveland 's. With a new or revamped county Justice Center under active review, it 's a matter of urgency that Greater Clevelanders debate whether they 'd be better served by one countywide municipal court that could achieve both taxpayer savings and more seamless justice for all. <p> Such a unified court would not necessarily mean an ungainly clog of traffic and small-civil-claims cases in one place ; likely, satellite court offices in the suburbs would continue to hear those cases. <p> But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of cases, fairer determinations of bail, broadened availability of pretrial and probation services, coordinated e-filing and other integrated technology and more comprehensive specialized dockets for veterans, drug cases, mental health and other matters. <p> Cuyahoga County, with about 1.25 million residents, is an outlier among Ohio 's most populous counties in having multiple municipal courts. Franklin County( Columbus), with an estimated 1.29 million residents, long has had one countywide municipal court. So has Hamilton County( Cincinnati), with an estimated 814,000 residents. <p> Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Administrative and Presiding Judge John J. Russo and Common Pleas Judge David T. Matia, who leads the county 's drug docket, started the ball rolling on this necessary conversation by noting recently that the county needs to make a decision about municipal court consolidation as planning begins for a possible Justice Center replacement. <p> Their proposal, however, would have been strengthened if some municipal court judges had stood up to make the suggestion with them. Russo wisely has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail reform, but it 's obviously even more important that any dialogue on municipal court consolidation involve municipal court judges. <p> That said, centralization could bring significant benefits, as outlined repeatedly by cleveland.com reporters in their Justice for All series. Comparing Cuyahoga County to Hamilton County, reporter Peter Krouse has pointed to the myriad ways in which a unified municipal court like that in Hamilton County makes court services more broadly available and efficient. As just one example, it would make it easier to have suspects assessed before bond hearings and screened for drugs or mental illness. <p> A centralized court also could be staffed by the county public defender. Now, the Cuyahoga County Public Defender 's office staffs Cleveland Municipal Court, but not the others. <p> There are important diversity considerations if municipal judges were to be elected countywide. Reduced minority representation in our local judiciary is a significant concern, since the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas bench currently lacks any Hispanic judge and includes no African-American male judges and just four African-American women among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipal Court judges include an Hispanic woman, an African-American male and five black women. <p> But this issue can be addressed -- and it was, in Hamilton County, with the election of judges by districts, who have countywide jurisdiction once in office. That could be a way to assure that lawyers of color in Cuyahoga County have reasonable opportunities to win seats on a countywide municipal court. <p> The timing is important. As Matia and Russo said, municipal court consolidation is something that needs to be discussed now, before a no-turning-back decision is made about the Justice Center. That discussion has to be inclusive and thorough, but it should not be delayed. <p> About our editorials : Editorials express the view of the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer -- the senior leadership and editorial-writing staff.
