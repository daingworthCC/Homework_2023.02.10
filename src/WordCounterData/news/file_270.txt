3048141 <p> ANGELA ALIOTO : JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNIST <p> Editor -- Lack of substance disguised as " Liberal and Proud of It "( April 16) describes quite accurately what San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto represents. While pretending to be the champion for all that is far left, Alioto enters the mayoral race as nothing but another political opportunist. With the patronizing remark, " I am the only candidate in this race that really cares about the people, " she assumes we are dumb enough to believe it. While chastising the mayor 's significant efforts to make the city safer by cleaning up Market Street, Union Square and the tents in the Civic Center, Alioto 's altruism for those who sleep in doorways, panhandle aggressively and urinate in public would most likely not be the same if those elements appeared in her polished neighborhood. Yet she suggests that Mayor Jordan is detached from his constituents because " he lives in Pacific Heights... across the street from me. " Well, being neighbors is all they share in common, because Alioto 's qualifications certainly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks the mayor for lacking leadership ; however, it is she who failed to steer a productive course as president of the Board of Supervisors. So disorganized is City Hall that the Wall Street Journal recently ran a front-page article entitled : " Who Needs Oprah? SF Has Board of Supervisors. " Our city politics have become a joke, and it is self-proclaimed leaders removed from reality like Alioto who hope to perpetuate it. <p> DIETRICH von BEHREN <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> RUNNING A TIGHT SHIP <p> Editor -- In the Sunday interview, Supervisor Alioto made reference to the electronic fingerprinting requirement in our General Assistance program. She stated that the fingerprinting program " that was going to save us $ 2 million has cost us $ 4.5 million. " Her statement is inaccurate. In fact electronic fingerprinting has produced a net savings of $ 1 million since it was implemented one year ago, which is exactly the savings anticipated by our department and by the supervisors ' budget analyst. <p> The fingerprinting program implements Proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November of 1993. After exempting the physically handicapped and mentally ill, we have discontinued over 400 clients who have refused to be electronically fingerprinted. More to the point, we are prosecuting 39 individuals who were caught receiving duplicate aid. <p> General Assistance is a $ 50 million-per-year, locally funded program for poor, single adults. After doubling in size and cost over a five-year period, the General Assistance caseload has gone from 15,600 in the spring of 1993 to 14,400 this last month. Unlike the other Bay Area counties, we kept our grant at $ 345 per month because to do otherwise would increase homelessness and reduce opportunities for exits to the work world. <p> If we are to maintain the General Assistance grant at that level we have to assure the taxpayers we are running a tight program. <p> BRIAN CAHILL <p> General Manager <p> Department of Social Services <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> ENFORCE LAWS EQUALLY <p> Editor -- Why should we be honest when we file our taxes? While millions of Americans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with connections should not be required to do the same. <p> The best example of unequal treatment by the IRS is Oliver North, who owes at least $ 6 million in taxes on the $ 13 million he received during 1985-86 and failed to report( there is no statute of limitations on filing false tax returns). Our Constitution is supposed to guarantee equal treatment under the law. Darryl Strawberry went to jail for a much smaller amount of underreporting, while North has not even been asked to pay. This is certainly not equal treatment. If the government wants people to obey the law, they must enforce it equally. <p> JOHN MESSINA <p> San Jose <p>. <p> END THE WAR ON DRUGS <p> Editor -- Thank you for your editorial " Time to Jump-Start Anti-Drug Campaign "( April 9). I agree. It 's way past time we drop the ill-conceived War on Drugs and concentrate on more effective ways of warning people( children especially) that, although they have a choice because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are hazards associated with drugs and that addiction is a real bad idea. <p> We were not intelligent enough to learn from our first mistake( Prohibition) and so we had to act out the whole miserable scenario all over again -- strong-arm tactics that only create a strong underground, the criminalization of Americans who otherwise would not be criminals, the looting of the federal treasury to pay for one more war that can only fail, the abridgement of our fundamental rights, the murder by the police of innocent people, etc. <p> Who came up with the bright idea of government protecting people from themselves anyway? The role of government is to protect the weak from the strong. Other than that, the government has no role. Even the police know that drugs is not a police problem. We have a real nasty habit in this country of making certain things both immoral and illegal. This simply spawns fierce resistance. <p> Hopefully, the current Republican tide will sweep out the War on Drugs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense. <p> DANIEL STONE <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> A FEW SIMPLE CURES <p> Editor -- Re : your editorial about drugs -- there are simple ways to solve the drug problem and also the crime problem that goes with it. Keep in mind that courts, attorneys, prosecutors, judges, newspapers, cops, prison guards and others in the judicial system all need crime to keep themselves employed. <p> So I say : Close up the liquor stores ; put a piece of rope in every jail cell ; hang or shoot the drug pushers 24 hours after convicted ; shoot the taggers who deface walls ; close up gun shops ; outlaw guns ; if someone needs to be in prison over 20 years, hang them ; send unruly kids with guns and knives to a desert boot camp for six months. <p> You either want crime or do n't want it. After you hang a few dozen drug pushers in civic center, the drug problem will disappear fast. <p> Taxpayers get fed up paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> R. R. MILLER <p> Burlingame <p>. <p> MISGUIDED SOCIETY <p> Editor -- What kind of a society are we if we need a law to guide us about breast-feeding? <p> An infant is hungry and the mother must first refer to a law? What is the fear? All women have breasts( aside from cancer situations). They come in all shapes and sizes. They are a natural part of the human body. They are not vulgar or threatening. Breast- feeding is not a sexual act. Breast- feeding is a life-affirming act. People who are squeamish about breast-feeding do n't need a law. They need therapy. <p> TANJA ORBECK <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> A TURNING POINT <p> Editor -- I have recently served on a murder jury. It was a harrowing experience. Everyone seems to talk tough on crime, but when in the jury room at a murder trial, some people get very nervous and timid. The prosecution has to convince 12 out of 12 jurors that the defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty. The defense, however, only has to provide one out of 12 jurors either enough doubt to cause them to hesitate or an excuse to support their prejudice not to convict and the defendant walks. <p> Prejudiced people with preconceived ideas will lie to get on a jury. It can work in both directions. One person can hold up either a deserved acquittal or a conviction. <p> The O. J. Simpson trial can represent a significant turning point in the American criminal justice system if it prompts us to modify the jury system to allow a finding of either guilt or innocence with a vote of 10 to 2. <p> MIKE SAVINO <p> Sacramento
