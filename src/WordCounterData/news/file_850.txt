5023441 <p> In his first interview following his arrest last month on sexual abuse charges, an emotional and unyielding R. Kelly denied having sex with underage girls and portrayed himself as a victim of a social media-fueled smear campaign. <p> Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, screamed, cursed and pleaded to the camera in the sit-down with Gayle King, a host of " CBS This Morning, " parts of which aired on Wednesday. <p> " Hate me if you want to, love me if you want, " Mr. Kelly said. " But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I 've been through -- oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and do n't let them eat, do n't let them out! " <p> He continued, directly into the camera and growing tearful : " I did n't do this stuff! This is not me! " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an expletive. He jumped out of his seat and became so upset that Ms. King paused the interview so he could regain his composure. <p> Mr. Kelly, 52, was charged last month in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four women, three of whom were minors at the time. He was released from jail last week after a woman describing herself as a friend of Mr. Kelly posted a $100,000 bond. <p> His arrest came after a Lifetime documentary, " Surviving R. Kelly, " brought new attention to accusations that he had mistreated women and revived prosecutors ' interest in his behavior. <p> " Everybody says something bad about me, " Mr. Kelly said, referring to the documentary. " Nobody said nothing good. They was describing Lucifer. I 'm not Lucifer. I 'm a man. I make mistakes, but I 'm not a devil. And by no means am I a monster. " <p> CBS released portions of the interview Tuesday night, and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. King repeatedly pressed Mr. Kelly about the many allegations against him. He gave no ground, and often fired back at his accusers. <p> When she asked him if he had broken any laws, he responded, " Absolutely not. " <p> " You can start a rumor on a guy like me or a celebrity just like that, " he said. " All you have to do is push a button on your phone and say : ' So and so did this to me. R. Kelly did this to me. ' " <p> When Ms. King asked Mr. Kelly if he had done anything wrong, he said : " Lots of things wrong when it come to women, that I apologize. But I apologized in those relationships at the time I was in the relationships. " <p> One of the women he is charged with sexually abusing as minors, Jerhonda Pace, said on Instagram and Twitter that what she saw in the interview " was a man that needs help. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him the truth " about his conduct, she wrote. " Him believing he 's doing no wrong is no different than an adult telling a child Santa is real. " <p> According to prosecutors, another of the underage girls was the same one who appeared in a sex tape with Mr. Kelly that resulted in a 2008 trial on child pornography charges. The girl did not testify then, and Mr. Kelly was found not guilty after his lawyers successfully argued that his identity could not be proved. <p> In an excerpt from the interview released on Tuesday, Mr. Kelly referred to his acquittal, telling Ms. King : " You ca n't double jeopardy me like that. You ca n't. It 's not fair. " <p> The new charges involving that girl are based on a newly obtained videotape, about two decades old, that came from someone who had once been in contact with Mr. Kelly. That person recently gave the tape to Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer, who turned it over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and birthday girl were all victims of R. Kelly. <p> In the tape, the girl refers several times to having 14-year-old body parts and, according to Mr. Avenatti, the acts depicted in the video were different from those at the center of the 2008 case, eliminating any issue of double jeopardy. <p> Ms. King also mentioned that Lady Gaga had recently apologized for having collaborated with Mr. Kelly on a song several years ago. Mr. Kelly responded : " She 's a very great talent and it 's unfortunate that her intelligence go to such a short level when it comes to that. " <p> Some of the interview covered allegations separate from Mr. Kelly 's criminal case : that he has held women in a kind of sexual and emotional captivity, dictating their every move, including when they can go to the bathroom. The parents of two women now living with Mr. Kelly, Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23, have accused him of brainwashing their daughters. <p> " I love them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like they 're like my girlfriends. We have a relationship. It 's real and I know guys like -- I 've known guys all my life that have five or six women, okay. So do n't go there on me. " <p> As for their age, Mr. Kelly said : " I do n't look at much younger than me. I just look at legal, " and that he was an " older man that loves all women, " regardless of age. <p> He also said the women 's parents had encouraged them to get close to R. Kelly to jump-start their music careers. " What kind of father, what kind of mother would sell their daughter to a man? " he said, adding that Ms. Clary 's parents had wanted her to have sex with him. <p> An interview Ms. King conducted with Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage will air on Friday. In an excerpt aired on Wednesday, Ms. Clary is visibly emotional. <p> " I 'm crying because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. " You guys believe in some facade that our parents are saying ; this is all lies for money. If you ca n't see that, you 're ignorant, and you 're stupid, " adding several expletives. <p> Ms. Clary 's parents responded on Twitter via Mr. Avenatti. <p> After Ms. Savage 's parents held a news conference in Atlanta later in the morning, their daughter called them. According to a television reporter who was there, the parents said it was the first time they had spoken with her in two years. <p> Mr. Kelly could soon wind up back in jail ; according to The Chicago Sun-Times, a court ordered that if he did not pay his ex-wife the $161,663 he owes her in child support by Wednesday morning, he could be jailed for failure to pay. It was unclear Wednesday afternoon if he had paid.
