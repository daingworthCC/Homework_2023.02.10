3059941 <p> Woulda, coulda, shoulda... <p> With four starters and three all-staters returning, Stevenson would have been the nation 's No. 1 team entering the 1995-96 season. They should have been a lock to repeat as state champions and they could have been the best team in state history. <p> But the rest of the field caught up when junior forward Tamika Catchings moved to Texas with her mother last August. She joined one of the most powerful and winningest high school programs in the nation at Duncanville, which is Texas ' answer to six-time state champion Marshall. <p> Still, the cupboard is n't bare for Patriots coach Frank Mattucci. Catchings ' sister Tauja, a senior and arguably the team 's most valuable player last season, and Katie Coleman are both returning after being selected to the Chicago Sun-Times All-Area team last winter. <p> Point guard Christy Miller and rehabilitated Jennifer Warkins, who started several games last year before a season-ending knee injury, are back. So is three-point specialist Trish DeClark, a soccer standout who started as a sophomore. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still be there at the end, " Mattucci said. " There is no way to replace Tamika. We 'll have to try to do it by committee and play better defense. " <p> Marshall is the only team that has captured more than one Class AA state title. The Patriots open defense of their state championship Nov. 22 in the Maine West Tournament against the host Warriors. Then they face Public League powers Young and Washington. Also on the schedule are games against nationally ranked powers Trinity from Garfield Heights, Ohio, and Milwaukee 's Pius XI. <p> The departure of Tamika Catchings, last season 's Miss Basketball, opens up the state field which could be as well balanced as any in history. <p> " There are probably eight to 10 teams in the Chicago area that can win the state, " Mattucci said. " We just have to make sure we 're thinking about this season and not the medals we won in March. " <p> In addition to Stevenson 's duo, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard, Downers Grove North 's Casey Leonhardt, St. Ignatius ' Maureen McManaman, Maine West 's Salena Miller, Marshall 's Sabrina Minter, Elgin 's Melissa Parker and Leslie Schock, Young 's Natasha Pointer, Loyola 's Kristin Santa, Hersey 's Abbie Willenborg and Naperville North 's T.J. Williams. <p> Here 's a look at the Super 25 : <p> 1. STEVENSON : The return of Christy Miller will be a big help in the ball-handling department. If Tauja Catchings and Coleman draw too much attention, look for DeClark and Warkins to pick up the scoring. The bench will be experienced with seniors Kim Carter, Noelle Medenwaldt and Felice Rosenzweig joining juniors Amy Chaness, Kelly Kirsten( transfer from Colorado) and Caroline Roth. Freshmen Karen Fricke and Lauren Jiggetts, daughter of former Bears lineman and radio personality Dan, are the future. <p> 2. ELGIN : Parker and Schock have done everything except play in the state finals. It 's now or never for the two all-staters, who combined to average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solid with juniors Suzy Smith, and Tina Weinckatis joining senior Karisa Turek. Anna Hallock, a transfer from St. Edward, adds depth and rebounding up front. The Maroons should cruise unbeaten into the Wheaton North Christmas Tournament. <p> 3. WASHINGTON : Coach Willie Byrd has a team that " can go undefeated or lose five or six games in the first three weeks. " A brutal schedule begins with Mother McAuley tomorrow and includes Stevenson, Maine West, Hersey, Young, York and Morgan Park in the first seven games. The Minutewomen return all five starters -- seniors Damita Evans and Sherry Oliphant and juniors Tyanna Jones, Michelle Artis and Josie Cole. Senior Beverly Holmes is much improved and will challenge for a starting spot. <p> 4. MAINE WEST : There are no superstars, but coach Derril Kipp may have more good players than anyone. Miller, Julie Fregetto, Eileen Kerrigan and Veronica Lambert are returning starters. The key may be 6-1 Dawn Vana, a sophomore with tremendous potential. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have size, experience and plenty of outside shooting. The key will be how the backcourt performs under pressure. <p> " I like this team, " said Kipp, who needs 23 victories to reach 400. " We 're going to be much improved over last year. " <p> 5. RESURRECTION : Four starters are back from a team that led Stevenson with less than four minutes to play in the supersectional. The leaders are guard Tara Babich, who is an excellent shooter, and junior forward Amy Anderson, the class president who ranks No. 1 academically. Coach Frank Zepf calls Anderson " a blue-chipper. " Lefty guard Erin Stafford and Julie Johnson also return. Look for 6-1 junior Beth Gawlinski to be a force inside. The Bandits graduated leading scorer Melissa Collins and most of last season 's depth. <p> 6. MARSHALL : Commandos ' coach Dorothy Gaters was n't pleased with last season 's 19-9 record, but her young( one upperclassman) squad still made the city championship game for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard, Christian Evans and Latrice Ray are the top returners. The biggest reason for optimism of a return to the top lies with a pair for outstanding freshmen -- forward Kourtney Walton and guard Kim Murray. <p> " Kourtney is going to be one of our all-time best players, " Gaters said. " And as good as she is as a player, she 's an even better person. " <p> 7. LYONS : The Lions, who figure to battle Hinsdale Central for first place in the West Suburban Silver, are as good as anyone up front with three-year starters Aubrey Sekal, Kelly Maley and Kelly Byrne. Coach Dawn Schabacker has a healthy Amanda Miller to lead in the backcourt and get support from Jamie Selip and Kate Walse. A trip to the Elite Eight is likely if Maley returns to form after concentrating on volleyball last summer. <p> 8. YOUNG : Pointer is the best player in the city and Clarissa Flores is the most improved. The two give the defending city champions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Year Dominique Canty. Danielle Pinkston gained valuable experience by starting last season and is much improved as is guard Shereena Clarke. Freshman Shanay Williams is a player to watch. <p> 9. LOYOLA : Senior forward Beth Schillen and junior guard Santa were last year 's leaders and top scorers. Among the other returners for coach Tanya Johnson are Julie Bumgardner, Megan Finn and sophomore sharpshooter Jeanette Paukert. It 's hard to ignore the state 's best freshmen class. Center Olga Gvozdenovic and guard Laura Sobieszczyk are potential blue-chippers. <p> " Last time I checked, seniors made mistakes, " Johnson said. " Sophomores drive you crazy and freshmen make you want to pull your hair out. " <p> Do n't believe her. This team is loaded. <p> 10. GLENBROOK SOUTH : The strength is in the backcourt, which could be the best in the suburbs with All-America Leonard, who led the Titans to the 1994 state title, her freshman sister Brett and Anna Yum. McKenzie Krueger, who signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up front. <p> 11. HINSDALE CENTRAL : Coming off the best season in school history, the Red Devils return the talent to make it to the state finals. Center Leah Berki, who was injured part <p> of last season, forward Dawn Peterson and underrated junior guard Jenny Pavich are returning starters for coach Steve Gross. Sophomores Ashley Homeyer and Laura Barnard are newcomers who will make an impact. <p> 12. BUFFALO GROVE : The Mid Suburban favorites are experienced and deep. Forwards Cherise Compobasso, the MSL North player of the year in 1995, Kate Harker and point guard Stacy Kondziolka are returning starters. The top three reserves from last season 's Elite Eight qualifier, Tanisha Brewer, Anne Sudlow and Diana Wendell, are back. Top newcomers are coach Tom Dineen 's daughter Jaime and Compobasso 's sister Christy. <p> 13. NAPERVILLE NORTH : Williams leads an experienced group that rates a big edge in the Du Page Valley. Senior Alicia Stewart and 6-2 Hollie Jo Renner, a transfer from Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rizek and sophomore Gena Earl also return. A weak schedule, with no games against top 10 teams, could mean a perfect record. But the lack of competition may hurt by the supersectional. <p> 14. MORGAN PARK : There is n't a lot of size, but the Mustangs, who have become regulars in the city 's Final Four, are as athletic as any team. Morgan Park will challenge in the Red-South with seniors Shawntay Williams and 6-foot Monica Richardson. Sophomores Camille Williams and Jasmine Moore gained valuable experience last season and will start. A newcomer to watch is freshman Constance Jinks. <p> 15. MOTHER McAULEY : Last season 's Class AA runner-up is loaded up front with 6-2 Jeanene Novick and 6-foot junior standout Katie Schumacher, back from a second consecutive state volleyball title, leading the way. Andrea Gunnell returns at point guard after winning the state 's three-point shooting contest last season. Graduation took its toll but the Mighty Macs always find replacements. <p> 16. JOLIET : Al Mart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad is experienced and athletic. Junior Samantha Cartwright has Division I talent and 4-9 point guard Lori Shelby may be the most entertaining player in the state. Also returning are Janell Tabor and Machell Roberts. <p> 17. NEW TRIER : Scoring leaders Briana Fitzgerald and junior Emily Krone return for the defending Central Suburban South champions as does guard Becca Kaufman and most of the bench. The question mark is how well the backcourt can handle pressure. Junior Molly Metzger could be the answer. Watch freshmen Brittany Larson and Katie Romey. <p> 18. ST. IGNATIUS : The inside game is solid with McManaman and 6-foot sophomore Michelle Shaughnessy. Mary Pope returns at a forward spot. The key will be the backcourt play where senior Maureen Faut will be expected to lead the way. Coach Tom McKenna is looking for juniors Jamie Rochton and Molly Kavanaugh to contribute. <p> 19. FENWICK : For the first time, veteran coach Dave Power has senior girls at the school. The defending East Suburban Catholic champions return in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backcourt, scoring leader Kristian Fano, Bonnie Hoffman and Danielle Moles are back. Up front look for Michelle Canerday, Brenna Smith, Katie Marino, Kate Loftus and Eloise Kucia. <p> " This is our toughest schedule, " Power said. " We start with Warren and that 's the last team that beat Stevenson. " <p> 20. MAINE SOUTH : The Hawks return four starter, sisters Denise and Joy Pavichevich, Colleen Tedor and Claire Pawloski. But the graduation of Sue Sroka( UIC) left a big hole in the front line and there is n't a lot of size on coach Mike Deines ' roster. Watch sophomore Kori Bieszczad. <p> 21. HERSEY : The Huskies will battle Buffalo Grove and Fremd in the MSL North. Marquette-bound center Willenborg and point guard Chris Wolff have been starters for three years. Two keys for coach Linda Mass will be Melissa Schneider, who could emerge as a big scorer, and Kathy Gambill, who, with Willenborg, helped Hersey to a sectional volleyball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for second-year coach Bob Newton. Maureen Collins is the leading scorer and Angie Marino, Erin Luby and junior Katie Ward are experienced. Top newcomers are Alicia Hirtzig and freshman Kathleen Mitchell. With some breaks, the Panthers could challenge the top teams in the GCAC. <p> 23. BLOOM : The consolidation of Bloom and Bloom Trail gives veteran coach Marilyn Anderson lots of options. Seniors Keesha Humphrey, a three-point specialist, and 5-11 forward Roslyn Turner figure to form the best inside-outside combination in the southern suburbs. Others to watch include Tamara Thomas, Jessica Mannery, Shauntel Miller, Ebony Bennett and LaRhoda Dixon. <p> 24. DOWNERS GROVE NORTH : You ca n't ignore a team with 6-5 Leonhardt and four-year varsity guard Melanie Fisher, who is healthy after missing most of last season with a broken vertebra. Sophomore Mary Magrane and Lauren Blumenshein also return. Coach Ron Jakes is hoping for a 20-win season. <p> 25. OAK FOREST : Coach Sue Bonner 's Bengals quietly won a sectional last season. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams are back. Newcomers include juniors Meggan MacFarlanem Carrie Byrne and Jean Nagler.
