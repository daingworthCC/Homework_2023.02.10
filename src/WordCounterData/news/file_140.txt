3029341 <p> Times change. <p> Consider : In 1961, womanizing in the White House was seldom discussed ; in 1998, you hear about little else. <p> Then again, times do n't change as much as you think. <p> Consider : In 1961, Disney released The Parent Trap ; in 1998, it just released another The Parent Trap. <p> And then there are reminders that the more things change, the more they stay the same. <p> Consider : In 1961, John Glenn was preparing for his first foray into space ; in 1998, Glenn is getting ready to go again. <p> All of which brings us to Roger Maris and the media of ' 61 compared to Mark McGwire and the media of ' 98. <p> Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961, breaking Babe Ruth 's homeric record of 60 set in 1927. This summer St. Louis Cardinals slugger McGwire leads a three-way race -- with Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners -- to see if one or more of them can break what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " To hit a home run, all you have to do is clear the fences, " says Red Foley, 69, who was a sports reporter at the New York Daily News in ' 61. " But McGwire clears them so majestically that people ooh and aah. And that 's Ruthian. " <p> When McGwire swats a Ruthian blow, ESPN often cuts in with live shots : You know Big Mac has hit one out before he rounds the bases. When Maris hit 61 in ' 61, radio was often the best instantaneous way for fans to know when another one left the park, though only if you lived where Yankees games were broadcast. <p> It was a time when many fans depended on newspapers -- egad, even afternoon papers, which barely exist anymore -- to follow the <p> drama of a baseball season. Conventional wisdom says it will be harder for McGwire than it was for Maris, because the media blowtorch burns far hotter now than was ever dreamed of then. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think. Maybe the more things change, the more they stay the same. <p> The written word <p> Times change : How different were the media in the summer of ' 61? Well, we could start with this : The word " media " was n't used so much back then. <p> More often the word was " press, " because most of the media types prowling clubhouses were reporters and columnists for newspapers. True, NBC 's Game of the Week was already a staple. The TV age was coming on fast -- Maris ' New York Yankees would soon be bought by CBS -- but it was n't yet in full flower. <p> " If TV wanted to come into the clubhouse, it was like moving the 4th Marines, " says Foley, an official scorer at Yankees and Mets games. <p> Road games were televised locally once or twice a week, but the written word was still the primary way to follow baseball, just as it had been in Ruth 's day. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a black-and-white world in ' 61. Color TV was coming, but ESPN, CNN and Fox Sports Net were far in the future. Any idea of laptop computers and the Internet was the stuff of science fiction. <p> It was in ' 61 that Alan Shepard, who died only last month, beat out Glenn as the first American in space. Who knew then that satellites, fruit of the ' 60s space race, would one day beam baseball games across the continent? Or that the day would come when you could put a satellite receiver the size of a pie plate on your roof to pull in any major league game? <p> " Ballplayers are under the microscope today, " retired manager Sparky Anderson says. " There are cameras everywhere now. It used to be mostly newspaper guys. Now it 's everything. They swarm over you like flies. McGwire has n't seen anything yet. Wait until it gets down to the last 45 days. No one could be prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times do n't change as much as you think : Yes, the media have changed at warp-speed since ' 61. But there is one thing that has not changed. Pressure is still pressure. <p> Tony Kubek, who was the Yankees ' shortstop in ' 61 and who spent many years as a baseball analyst on TV, says Maris faced pressure of the most unrelenting sort in ' 61 -- to the point that his hair began falling out in patchy clumps. <p> It is entirely possible that the pressure on Maris was greater than it will be on any of the three making an assault on the record this summer. <p> Here 's why : As the media have grown, so have rules to hold it in check. McGwire talks to the media for 30 minutes three hours before the first game of every road series. After games, he takes only questions relating to the game just played. He does n't do telephone or live-shot TV interviews. Interview requests are funneled through the Cardinals ' media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few limits on access unless a player imposed them. Worse, Maris was not naturally quotable. <p> " Today, interviewing rooms and pre-arranged question periods impose limits of time and place upon the media, " Roger Kahn wrote in his 1997 book Memories of Summer. " No one thought to do that 30 years ago. Maris, rather a shy sort, was left naked to interrogators for hours before and after every game. " <p> That is just how Kubek recalls it in Sixty-One, his memoir of the season : " I remember Roger showing up at 9 a.m., and that was for night games. He had interviews morning, noon and night.... And you had a guy like Roger who was n't especially glib. " <p> Jack Lang, who covered the Yankees for the Long Island Press in ' 61, says Maris never had the benefit of a podium or a microphone for the entire season, even the day he hit the Big One. <p> " No one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says. " Certainly not the players. We were chattel. And every writer, columnists like Jimmy Cannon and Dick Young, wanted a one-on-one. And Roger would give it to them, meet them for breakfast, whatever. " <p> He was given to yes or no answers. When writers would ask Maris if he were going to break the record, Kubek says a typical response was : " How should I know? " That was June. By late summer, according to The New York Yankee Encyclopedia, that had deteriorated to " How the hell should I know? " <p> But Maris remained cooperative with beat reporters throughout the season, Lang says. " I liked Roger, and I think most of us did, " he says. " There might have been a couple of guys who did n't, but most of us got along with him. It 's just that he was a shy guy, a farm boy from North Dakota in the big city, and the constant questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1962, his relations with some writers soured. " The community of baseball thinks Mickey Mantle is a great player, " Cannon wrote that season. " They consider Maris a thrilling freak who batted.269. " <p> Open warfare like that was rare in ' 61. But Maris had another problem : He was chasing the ghost of a beloved icon. The country roots for McGwire to break Maris ' record, whereas much of the country rooted for Ruth 's record to stand. <p> Or, if it were to be broken, that the honor go to Mantle. Kubek batted second, Maris third and Mantle fourth in the Yankees ' lineup that season. For a long time it looked like Mantle would have the better shot at the record. But he faded and wound up with 54. Still, Mantle was seen as the rightful heir to Ruth in a line of pinstriped succession that included Joe DiMaggio. <p> How much of that was put in people 's minds by writers, or, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was merely reflected by writers, is hard to say. Kubek figures it does n't matter. Either way, Maris felt tortured and trapped by the drip-drip-drip of daily questions for hours on the same subject. <p> Commissioner Ford C. Frick ruled in July 1961 that if it took more than 154 games to beat the record, then it would stand apart from Ruth 's -- that there would be one record for a 154-game season and another for 162 games. Maris broke the record in the season 's last game and Frick 's ruling came to be called an asterisk. It did not apply to other season records, just to home runs. In other words, just to Maris. <p> Kubek 's book says a survey by The Sporting News found two-thirds of the writers supported Frick. One who did not was Larry Merchant, who wrote in the Philadelphia Daily News : " Frick is out of order.... He tries to change tides. He can not. " <p> The tide changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The record belongs to Maris alone. At least for now. <p> Greater presence <p> The more things change, the more they say the same : The game is the same. Batters still try to hit. Pitchers still try to get them out. <p> In some ways the game has changed -- the cult of relief pitchers, for instance, and the shifting strike zone -- but in others it never will. It is still three strikes and you 're out. It is still sock one over the fences and you trot around the bases. And it is still a face-the-media affair either way, whether a star like McGwire strikes out or hits one out. <p> " This is baseball, " McGwire says. " You have to remember the pitcher is trying to get you out and usually has a lot of ways to do it. Hitting a home run is the most difficult thing in sports. " <p> And hitting 60-some of them in a season might be the most pressure-packed thing in sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Reggie Jackson suffered from hives when he took a run at the record in 1969. George Brett blames his hemorrhoids in 1980 on the media hordes who descended when he flirted with.400. <p> The pressure does n't come from questions, even repetitive ones. " What 's the pressure in standing around and talking baseball? " Jose Canseco asks. <p> The pressure comes instead from the media 's outsized presence, serving as a constant reminder of the chase. How do you put it out of your mind even for a moment when a phalanx of media members is off to the side, like the chorus in Greek drama, forever elaborating on the action? <p> " What happens if I do n't hit 60? " McGwire wonders. " I mean, 50 homers is an accomplishment. " <p> It is. But by the time he reaches 50, the media fires will only burn hotter. News organizations around the world will send representatives. It was n't as much that way in ' 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run even in large papers that would today send their own reporters. <p> The trend toward a traveling road show of national media following players who are nearing indelible records ratcheted up in 1985, when Pete Rose closed in on Ty Cobb 's all-time hits record. Rose mostly enjoyed the attention. But it was a career record, so he was going to get there eventually. It is different for McGwire, Sosa and Griffey. They are chasing the record for home runs in a season ; there is no inevitability to breaking it until it is done. <p> That 's part of the mystique. Babe Ruth broke his own record when he hit 60. That was no big deal in the sense that he was bigger than the record -- and still is. <p> It was another 34 years before Maris hit 61. That was a very big deal. And it has been 37 seasons since, making 1998 a big deal that will only grow bigger the closer the record comes into view. <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It has drama and history, greatness and ghosts, power and glory. Such stories draw storytellers as moths to a flame. And there are more media moths today than there have ever been. They will be drawn in record numbers to McGwire or the others in the weeks ahead. Count on it. <p> " They 'll want to know everything, " Sparky Anderson says. " Not just baseball stuff but what McGwire had for breakfast. Silly stuff. We can always say it 's silly, but if there is one thing we know for sure, it 'll get sillier down the road. That 's the American way. " <p> Contributing : Mel Antonen and Rachel Shuster
