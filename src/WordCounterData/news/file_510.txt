4114741 A bare-knuckles fight is about to begin for low-end luxury-car buyers. # Never mind that small cars generally do n't go over well with American buyers, except when fuel prices are jumping. # Or that the recession has left fewer people with enough cash or credit for a lux-mobile. # Or that some buyers might never accept " low-end " and " luxury " in the same sentence. # Or that a flood of vehicles targeting the same pool of buyers threatens to trigger a price war that would wreck profit projections for such cars. # But there 's no turning back. The entry, or newly named " gateway " luxury segment now is in play, and here come the players. # Most of the cars will be smaller and lower-price than the bigger models but able to boast higher mileage and -- automakers dearly hope -- able to draw a whole new crowd of younger buyers who 'll stay forever. # " Everybody wants to have a( BMW) 3 Series, " says Steve Shannon, U.S. marketing chief for Hyundai, which sells larger luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great spot to be in. " # The 3, a compact sedan, is " small enough to be big-city friendly, but big enough to be adequate for people living elsewhere. It successfully and magically attracts demographics from other segments, everybody from twentysomethings to senior citizens, " marvels Jesse Toprak, auto-industry expert at research and shopping site TrueCar.com # Most likely challenger : Cadillac 's $34,000 ATS compact sedan coming this summer. " They 'll do very well with it. I would n't be surprised if it became the No.1-selling car for Cadillac. If I were a dealer, I 'd be quite excited, " says Jim O'Donnell, retired chief of BMW in the U.S. and now an auto-industry expert at the New England Consulting Group. # ATS had to be " something Cadillac has never had, " a compact high-performance sedan that can " finally challenge the German cars at their own game and win, " GM 's President of the Americas Mark Reuss said at the car 's Detroit unveiling last month. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Caddy developed a new chassis for it instead of taking the more common and lower-cost path of modifying a platform already in production. And Cadillac engineers tested the car at the famous Nurburgring racetrack in Germany, an honored venue among driving enthusiasts. # " But taking on the BMW 3 Series? You need to walk before you can run, " O'Donnell says. # Other wannabes coming : the new Acura ILX and the redesigned Lincoln MKZ. # The ILX, due this spring, " effectively creates a new sporty compact segment on the leading edge of the luxury marketplace, " says Acura design studio chief Jon Ikeda. Acura is Honda 's upscale brand, and ILX can be viewed as a premium takeoff on the Honda Civic, from which it is derived. As with Civic, there 'll be a gas-electric hybrid version. # The redone MKZ is a key element in what Ford Motor says is the " reinvention " of its foundering Lincoln luxury brand with new and redesigned models. On sale later this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the current version, though it still will be the smallest Lincoln. Ford will take pains to distance it from the similar 2013 Ford Fusion, with which it will share a platform. A hybrid model is expected. # Jim Farley, in charge of worldwide marketing, sales and service at Ford Motor, says, " We hope to conquest new people, people who have never shopped a Lincoln before " by providing both a redone car and an improved dealership experience to rival the best. # To that end, Lincoln has persuaded more than half of its metro-market dealers to promise a heavy investment in new facilities. # Already in the low-end luxe firefight : Buick Verano and Lexus CT 200h. # Enough buyers consider Buick a premium, or even a luxury, brand that its $24,000 Verano small sedan, launched last November, is on the entry-luxe radar in spite of its mainstream price. It lacks some up-market features, such as a backup camera, and its Chevrolet Cruze underpinnings might doom it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bargain and siphon some buyers looking at other gateway luxury models. # CT 200h, an upscale gas-electric hybrid hatchback loosely based on the Toyota Prius, has been on sale since last March. It 's the brand 's newest and least expensive model, about $4,000 less than the cheapest version of the small, sporty Lexus IS sedans that some would consider a more direct challenge to the BMW 3 's. But the CT 's hybrid drivetrain, quirky looks, sporty chassis and $30,000 starting price are Lexus attempt to seduce luxury newcomers in a new way. # 3 Series has devoted following # Challenging the 3 Series is a formidable undertaking, whether done head-on, as the Caddy ATS will do, or obliquely, by selling a car that 's only roughly similar in size or price. Even BMW 's own smaller and lower-price model, the 1 Series, ca n't do it : BMW sells 11 times as many 3 's as 1's. # German competitors Mercedes-Benz and Audi have rival models, of course. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about match BMW 3 Series sales. So they 'll try new, smaller models, too, the most dramatic of which probably would be the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. # Introduced in the U.S. as the 1977 BMW 320, the first 3 Series car immediately drew admirers for its then-uncommon blend of sports-car handling and sedan practicality. # When the second-generation 1984 version of the 3 hit showrooms, upwardly mobile " yuppies "( young urban professionals) thought they 'd found the perfect wheels for their rising status. # Now it 's BMW 's best seller, accounting for 38% of all BMW 's U.S. sales last year. A slightly larger, quicker, more fuel-efficient, sixth-generation 3 just went on sale and it 's better-equipped than the car it replaces. The 328 sedan is $35,795 ; the 335i is $43,295. Even though the new one is much improved, BMW says, the price is up just $300. # BMW is saying, in effect, " Bring it on. " # Rivals have no choice, really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller, better-mileage models to offset the big-engine models that give a luxury brand its panache and earn big profits. # And they need entry models for what the industry believes is a tidal wave of successful twenty- and thirtysomethings, like those 1980s yuppies, looking for luxury-brand cars that are trim and technological -- and value-priced. Studies show that luxury buyers are more brand-loyal than others, so snagging buyers just as they 're ready for their first premium model is good business. # " People are more likely to get to a 7 through a 3 than through a Mercedes, " says Gary Stibel, CEO of the New England Consulting Group, referring to BMW 's flagship 7 Series big sedan and the mainstay 3 Series. # " Capture, land and expand, " he says. # Enough buyers to go around? # Whether that will be easy -- that is, whether there is the supposed pool of able buyers and they will tumble to the new machines -- is being debated. # " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cars( in the USA). They just do n't seem to resonate, " says Jack Nerad, auto industry veteran who is executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book 's kbb.com. # But TrueCar.com 's Toprak says, " Overall, the prospects in the small luxury segment are very positive. " # BMW spokesman Thomas Plucinsky notes that such market movement is happening elsewhere : " In Europe, there is a push toward luxury brands going to smaller-size cars. " Even in the bigger-is-better U.S., " We think we can go to the smaller size without watering down the brand, " he says. # Thus, BMW has " several( BMW-brand) models under consideration " that are as small as the models it sells under its Mini Cooper brand, Plucinsky says, and BMW plans them for the U.S. market in coming years. The so-called UKL cars( a European size designation) will be front-wheel drive, possibly sacrilege in the eyes of fans of the BMW that 's known for its rear-drive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way for BMW to market smaller, front-drive cars without undercutting the BMW rear-drive heritage. # It 's plain that a lot of money and maneuvering are aimed at what is, after all, just a slice of the premium market, which is itself a pretty small slice of the total new vehicle market. # Why? Because of what might happen. Says Acura 's Ikeda : " Now, the luxury market represents only 10% of total industry sales. But research shows that 80% of mass-market buyers are considering stepping up to a luxury vehicle. " # #
