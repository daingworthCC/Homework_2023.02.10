" He was just warming up. <p> That Rolling Stones singer went on to ask the Friday night crowd if anybody could remember the late 1980s, made a crack about the " dinosaur park, " a local tourist attraction, and expressed gratitude to fans who had stuck with the band through a half-century. <p> It 's safe to say that Michael Cervony Jr., 19, and Travis Kray, 18, were not his intended audience. Yet there they were, floating with delight after having spent their savings to travel across the country for the three-night Desert Trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Paul McCartney, the Who and Roger Waters, acts whose average age is north of 70.( The show repeats next weekend.) <p> " Bob Dylan killed it, " Mr. Kray, a University of Minnesota freshman, said the next morning, still glowing. " The Stones were phenomenal as well. It was crazy seeing them cover the Beatles. And when they played that Chicago blues song from the new album, I lost it. " <p> Yes, the baby boomers were an overwhelming presence at a festival marketed squarely to their nostalgia soft spot. As Mr. Cervony put it, " This is for rich, old hippies, not targeted at young people. " But it was n't all AARP members out in the desert. <p> Tucked away in the tent city of on-site camping was an oasis of relative youth that could have passed for Coachella proper, with beer pong and arcade games. The main difference was the soundtrack. <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people give an eye roll, " Mr. Cervony, who traveled from Louisiana State University, said with a positive-vibes lilt. " Everybody loves the same music. " But even among the fresher contingent, his baby face stood out. <p> While most of Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray 's peers are deep into rap and electronic dance music -- the core music festival audience this century -- the two bonded over classic rock and playing guitar during high school in Minnesota.( Getting into counterculture via the Beat generation and " Highway 61 Revisited " never quite goes out of style.) <p> Photo <p> Mick Jagger, along with Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and others, was one of the rock 's elder statesmen performing at the Desert Trip festival in Indio, Calif.Credit Carlos Gonzalez for The New York Times <p> But there 's a difference between appreciating the oldies and worshiping their current incarnations. When Mr. Cervony heard about Desert Trip from his mother, " I almost died, " he said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen the Stones, Mr. McCartney( twice) and the Who( the day after senior prom), " To see them all together is beyond anything I could 've ever expected or hoped for. " <p> Right away, he and the equally excitable, always grinning Mr. Kray began preparations to meet up in California. While most millennial Desert Trip attendees were with at least one older relative -- with many saying they were there at their parents ' insistence and on their dime -- Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray were among the youngest to go it alone. <h> Today 's Headlines <p> Wake up each morning to the day 's top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox. <p> Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box. <p> Invalid email address.

Mr. Kray dipped into the money he 'd saved from working as a lifeguard and painting houses. Each estimated they would spend $1,000 on the trip. <p> Choosing accommodations far from the most luxurious offered -- $1,599 " platinum " tickets, the $500 " culinary experience, " premium hotels -- the teenagers bought the cheapest three-day passes and crammed into a tiny tent with Mr. Kray 's older brother, Taylor, 20. After traveling from their college towns, the three took a 2:45 a.m. Greyhound to the festival from Los Angeles. <p> " We could n't afford to rent a car, " Mr. Kray said. <p> Mr. Cervony added, " And we 're not old enough. " <p> Still, nothing could dampen their constant, contagious elation.

Soon he would be back at Louisiana State, separated from his partner in rock and staring down midterms. For now, though, they were immersed in music. <p> " Seeing bands like this live makes listening to them more personal, " Mr. Kray said. Later, he would text that a duet between Mr. McCartney and Mr. Young " definitely made my year. " But when the bands were on, the students ' phones were down. <p> The musicians were mere specks from behind rows of cushioned seats and V.I.P. sections, yet Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray stood shoulder to shoulder, rapt and at ease. <p> A version of this article appears in print on October 10, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '.
