3057041 <p> " Do n't be afraid of the sauerkraut! " commanded Didier, our droll French waiter at Rouge. <p> I already liked the guy and the way his short white-blond hair stood at attention on top of his head, as if it might shoot off sparks. <p> But his sauerkraut tout made me a fan. Any Houston waiter bold enough to proselytize for snapper on a bed of pickled cabbage and fennel - a maritime riff on Alsatian choucroute - was a man after my own heart. So, I hoped, was a chef who would dare to serve it in a town where the bankable bet would be a lemon-butter treatment with crab or shrimp on top. <p> The fish arrived, singed to gold and crowned with two straight-and-narrow pancetta strips laid parallel, in perfect alignment. It was as if the double bars were saying, " Stop a moment and consider what you 're about to eat. " <p> That dish represented much of what I admire about chef Edelberto Goncalves ' cooking at this exciting new restaurant on Westheimer, just east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in love with its own simple geometrics. <p> Texturally, it played softness against softness in subtle gradations, with a flourish of crispness to highlight the point. <p> And the taste? Full of low-key surprise, the licoricey fennel bulb mellowing the sauerkraut 's tartness ; the earthy pancetta salt factor setting off the mildness of the fish. The merest side-swipe of Dijon cream and a few saffron potatoes completed the sly choucroute allusions. Fun to think about ; fun to eat. <p> That 's Rouge in a nutshell. For what I presume are marketing purposes, the place bills itself as serving New American food. But as far as I 'm concerned, it 's the best French restaurant in town. <p> I know, I know. Things French are politically inconvenient in post-Iraq America. To which I say : Get over it. The world would be a far sorrier place than it already is without French food, French wine, French cheese. For me, anyway, the pleasures of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and a disciplined technique that are identifiably French. Contemporary French - which is to say with greatly lightened sauces and assorted global twists - but French nonetheless, despite the pedigreed American ingredients and nods to Yankee pop culture( ritzy buffalo wings, Caesar salad). <p> Goncalves was born in Paris of Portuguese parents. At 31, he has already cooked at an impressive assortment of Michelin one- and two-star restaurants( including a stint in Paris with the celebrated Jacques Maximin). In Houston he has worked at Grille 5115, Masraff 's and Abuso Catering. <p> Rouge is an excellent forum for his talents. It 's a sleekly handsome room painted in a deep, ruddy aubergine. A narrow band of eye-level mirrors, running the length of opposite walls, opens the space up to infinity - and gives diners a satisfying opportunity to check out their neighbors without appearing to care. From the bare-midriffed young woman who seems to be channeling Paris Hilton to the gray-haired quartet who must have strayed off their path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Smart waiters are on duty. The refreshing wine list avoids the usual suspects, offering a friendly range of prices and a particularly good roster of French choices.( All those Rhones, including white ones, in a single place!) <p> Glassware is generous and thin of skin. Soft lighting neither glares nor obscures. In the dark-toned room, the tabletops are calm islands of white : snowy linens ; thick, squared-off dishware ; napkins in a cream shade for a sophisticated, just-off-center touch. Red roses from the Plant House next door( its owner is one of two partners here) look gorgeous in this burgundy-colored context. <p> But it 's the food that matters. Goncalves ' seafood dishes are particularly memorable. A high, satin-smooth square of Columbia River sturgeon, perfectly crisped on its edges, comes to life in a vividly tart shallot beurre blanc applied as a translucent wash across part of the plate. Its provocative companion : a molded potato cake flavored with briny caviar. <p> Thick-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmery, custardlike interior to the melting bed of leeks vinaigrette underneath. A scatter of grainy, high-grade sea salt - the prized French fleur du sel - is all that 's necessary to bring the dish into sharp focus. That little ribbon of balsamic wash on the plate? The side serving of pungent dark-olive tapenade? Blissfully beside the point. <p> A Morocco-inspired lobster dish makes its initial appearance under a hat-shaped ceramic casserole called a tagine, after which the crustacean is borne away and carved into pieces so tender, so delicate, they are scarily good. A gentle array of brothy, cumin-scented baby vegetables - including pearl onions and some gossamer miniature cabbage - is interesting and understated enough to put lobster in a new light. <p> A first course of seared foie gras also underscores Goncalves ' romance with things soft. The singe on the liver jumps out against a fragile small tart filled with fresh peach, and a puff of creme fraiche makes the whole thing melt together on the tongue. It tastes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part, Goncalves edits himself well, but on occasion he lets busy-ness creep in. A rabbit terrine that is startlingly moist and meaty, wrapped in a glassy gelatin film, would be swell with nothing more than its spicy little relish of lentils and prunes. It hardly needs a lot of caramelized onion on the side, let alone an otherwise fabulous, red-peppered sweet potato " mayonnaise, " meant to be spread on rustic garlic toast. <p> When you 're 31 and full of ideas, sometimes it 's hard to stop while you 're ahead. <p> An admirable rigor is more Goncalves ' style. He 'll poise a thick-cut round of pan-roasted veal on top of another round of brioche-wrapped boudin noir, a musky black blood sausage that is far more delicious than it sounds, and exactly right with the onion marmalade alongside. He 'll slice up perfect pineapple-glazed duck breast, not a shade too sweet, and line it up row by military-strict row on a molded round of couscous, along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Circles and straight lines, the savory and the slightly sweet, the firm and the soft - there 's an intelligence at work here. <p> The fits and starts of a 2-month-old restaurant manifest themselves in occasional oversalting( stiffish spinach gnocchi in a gratin with snails) or thin-skinned duck-confit dumplings in a wonderful tamari-tinted consomme that is fragrant with ginger. <p> Seared rare tuna squares aligned in a narrow center-plate row with square-cut pasta leaves looked dramatic ; two sunny oblongs of red-peppery, gingered carrot emulsion ran down either side of the plate in a composition that smacked of Ellsworth Kelly. Alas, the soy infusion that tinted the pasta sheets the same dark color as the tuna also made them violently salty. <p> And once the kitchen, acting completely out of character, overcooked a marine creature. Tiny squidlets stuffed with a dice of ratatouille were too bouncy to make a good impression, and the dish as a whole( again uncharacteristically) tasted flat. <p> But glitches tend to disappear in the glow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky rice tucked into a tamale husk and served with a dice of roast pineapple. The gratin of fresh berries under an airy froth of zabaglione custard reminds you why classics are classic. A pleasantly chewy dried-cherry cake, clafouti, goes against the local grain with its unreconstructed Frenchness. <p> And the inevitable molten chocolate cake reaches its most exalted Houston form at Rouge, where it is called an " extra-bitter chocolate moelleux. " It arrives dark and scallop-edged against its pristine white plate, an outrageously tall goblet of vanilla ice cream towering above it on a spindly glass stem. It 's the perfect birthday dessert : ice cream and cake. <p> Wine lovers will like the service style, in which by-the-glass choices are poured out at the table in sampler portions, so you can taste before you commit.( The Jean-Max Roger Sancerre, the King Estate Oregon pinot gris and the Benton Lane Oregon pinot noir are all good bets.) It is comforting to see an elegant red burgundy, like the Bouchard Santenay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there are plenty of good wines in the $ 20-$ 40 range. <p> All these can be enjoyed equally well in the urbane little bar, which boasts a couple of sweeping circular banquettes for large, convivial parties. <p> And yes, there is a lunch menu, in which a number of dinner entrees - at dinner prices - share the bill with less expensive main-course salads and ingenious tapas-like plates, even a pressed sandwich. Noon is a good time to partake of Goncalves ' smooth avocado soup, which is bright-tasting and cool against its garnish of brittle plantain chips, or a robustly seasoned salad of lentils and tender pork shank, with beautifully dressed arugula leaves and lime-spiked red onion rings for contrast. It 's a dish I can easily imagine eating in a Left Bank bistro. <p> But the evening hours are when this room and this menu are at their glamorous best. At midweek there are still plenty of empty tables, but I suspect that wo n't be the case for long. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even own up to being French. <p> Rouge : 812 Westheimer( one block east of Montrose) ; 713-520-7955 ; www.rougehouston.com <p> Hours : Lunch : 11:30 a.m. -2:30 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays ; dinner : 6-10 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays and 6-11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays <p> Credit cards : all major <p> Prices : starters $ 6-$ 15 ; entrees $ 16-$ 28( lunch specials $ 7-$ 15) ; desserts $ 6 <p> Reservations : recommended on weekends <p> Noise level : can be moderately high when crowded <p> Smoking : bar or patio only <p> TYPE : Restaurant Review
