4128941 " Be the right club today. " Hal Sutton 's famous roar as his 6-iron shot from 179 yards was in flight toward the flag on the 18th green in the final round of the 2000 Players Championship quickly became stamped into the event 's audio lexicon. The ball came to rest 8 feet from the hole, from where Sutton took two putts to hold off Tiger Woods to claim the coveted title. Sutton, a demonstrative sort to begin with, was especially animated that day as he had just conquered the generation 's best golfer, beat back the deepest field in golf and got the best of the Players Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass, a course featuring enormous risk and immense reward. Sutton 's shout has echoed throughout the canyons of trees that rim the course, uttered by scores of players throughout the history of the Tour 's showcase event, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Those five words and similar variations from the mouths of players flow freely -- dripping with hope and even prayer -- on a course that is Pete Dye 's masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height as the Tour 's greatest theater, the track is an assortment of skeleton fairways, sharp doglegs, undulating greens, penalizing water hazards and tough rough. It has been called aggravating, annoying, penalizing and infuriating. It is a layout that favors no one and is fair to all. In 39 previous editions of The Players, no one has won back-to-back titles, a testament to its difficulty from one year to the next. Bangers and bunters have won, ball-strikers and putters, too. As 2007 champion Phil Mickelson said, the course favors somebody who ends up playing well -- and who is in complete control of body, mind and soul. Or as Woods said, " You ca n't fake it around this place. It will eat your lunch. " And then there is : " There is no easy hole out there, " Retief Goosen said. " You always have to be in control of your emotions and thoughts everywhere on the golf course, " Masters champion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bad is going to be happening somewhere on that golf course all the time. " It 's a course that demands near perfection and dishes out plenty of ruin for the smallest of errors. With nearly every shot -- off the tee, into the green, on and around the putting surface -- you better have the right club in your hand. The champions have. Mementos of victory Just outside the Champions Room in the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse, in the Lifetime Achievement Hallway, is a testament to the craftsmanship of the manufacturers of the day 's best equipment and those who wielded the expertise. Each champion donated one club that helped them win the championship. In a glass-encased enclosure are those golf clubs, offering a timepiece through the game 's last 40 years. There is Jack Nicklaus ' MacGregor driver from 1974 ; Jerry Pate 's Wilson Staff 5-iron from 1982 ; Tom Kite 's Hogan pitching wedge from 1989 ; Davis Love III 's Ping Eye 2 lob wedge from his win in 1992 ; Woods ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes! C Groove Donna putter from his 2009 win ; and K.J. Choi 's TaylorMade R11 driver from 2011. The most donated club( 11) is a wedge, a nod toward the need to get up-and-down on a course that features sharp drop-offs by the greens. " Your short game is really important on a Pete Dye course, " Love said. " You are going to end up in a bad place around a Pete Dye course, and you better be able to handle up-and-downs, or you 're in big trouble. " Fred " Boom Boom " Couples donated the longest club in his bag from his 1984 win : a Cleveland Classic driver. " You kind of fell in love with a driver and hung on to it back then, you know, those wooden heads, you kind of got used to them and it was hard to find a good one, " Couples said. " I did n't donate it right away. I kept using it for a while. I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win. " You have to drive it well on that course. " Or you go home early. " Justin Leonard 's 1-iron Justin Leonard, who won in 1998, donated a club rarely used today. " That club was pretty big for me that week, " Leonard said of the Hogan Apex 1-iron, a present-day relic but a prized possession 15 years ago. The night before the final round, Leonard hit a bunch of 1-irons to get ready for Sunday. In the final round, he used it twice -- knocking his second shot on the par-5 second hole to 15 feet( for a two-putt birdie) and hitting his tee shot on the par-3 eighth to tap-in distance. " Obviously, when the wind starts blowing, having the right club on that golf course is so important. The small, firm greens are just tough to hit. The fairways are tough to hit. And if you miss shots out there, you are in big, big trouble. " Just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, has the tournament. Players will tell you it gets bigger and bigger each year, adding little things here and there that make the event better for the player, the fan and the news media. It has a purse of $9.5million and a first-place check of $1.71million. While debate on whether it should be the game 's fifth major has subsided, the tournament still resonates with the players. " We have our four major championships, and that 's that. But if there was going to be another one, this would be it, " Woods said. Said Love : " It 's our major. It 's the players ' major. We control it. And it gets bigger and bigger, and everyone wants to win it. " In 2007, The Players moved from March, two weeks before the Masters, to its present location in the May calendar. " It used to have the Little Brother syndrome, when everyone was talking about Augusta. The move from March, and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have its own synergy, " Leonard said. " This tournament is one of the biggest anyone plays. " Garcia said his 2008 win was the biggest individual win of his career. " After the majors, it 's without a doubt the biggest one we have. It is our tournament, " Garcia said. " It 's such a tough course. But it 's a fair course. You just have to control your golf ball on the course, because there is not much room for error. And the great thing about it is it plays tough without being a long course and you have to use every club in your bag to win. "
