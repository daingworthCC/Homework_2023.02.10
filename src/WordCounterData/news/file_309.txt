" He says that Brooks voted to perpetuate the early release of prisoners as a way of controlling the prison population. <p> The Libertarian challenger is physician Marshall Anderson of Pasadena. Like other candidates in his party, he favors drastically decreasing the government 's role on all fronts. He favors making all schools private and reducing federal judges ' ability to oversee the state criminal justice program. <p> The redistricting process -- itself the subject of courtroom battles between the Democrats and Republicans this year -- comes into play in the re-election quest of another veteran senator, Republican J.E.
