3056541 <p> MOSCOW - Russian soccer fans rampaged near the Kremlin after their team lost 1-0 to Japan in the World Cup on Sunday, setting fire to cars, smashing store windows and attacking a group of young Japanese musicians. <p> At least one man was killed in the melee. <p> An Associated Press photographer saw a mutilated corpse lying on the street during the chaos, which erupted across a square from the Kremlin walls and lasted for more than an hour. <p> At least seven cars could be seen burning and more than a dozen were overturned. Dozens of others had their windows smashed. <p> Thousands of fans ran through the streets chanting " Forward, Russia! " and other soccer slogans. They broke shop windows, jumped up and down on cars and fought among themselves, throwing empty bottles at each other. Some of them were wrapped in the Russian tricolor. <p> Plumes of smoke rose from several cars near the national parliament building, and from the square in front of the Bolshoi Theater. The windows of shops up to a mile away - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, an Ecco shoe store and the historic Yeliseyevsky grocery store - were smashed. <p> Damaged businesses also included a sushi bar and French, Italian and Chinese restaurants. <p> A Bloomberg News reporter, Eduard Gismatullin, who saw the riot, said a group of about 50 people caused the damage. <p> He said the rioters had been part of a crowd of thousands watching a big-screen broadcast of the match from Yokohama. <p> " There was a furious crowd of drunk skinheads, " said Liliya Kim, 27, a waitress at the Old China restaurant. " They destroyed our outdoor restaurant area. " <p> Cars had their windows broken, as well, along the road leading to the headquarters of the Russian security services, the former KGB, as well as in front of the offices of the Russian Presidential Administration. <p> The Interfax news agency said one man was knifed to death and more than 20 people, including one policeman, were injured in the riots. <p> A duty officer at the Interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed that one person was killed and 20 injured. Moscow 's chief prosecutor, Mikhail Avtyukhov, told ORT television that authorities found the corpse of a young man believed to have been beaten to death in the riot. <p> Avtyukhov said about 50 people had been hospitalized, including more than 20 law enforcement officers. <p> Moscow police chief Vladimir Pronin said there were 8,000 fans involved, according to Interfax. The agency quoted Moscow police spokesman Sergei Shevtsov as saying that about 60 people were detained. <p> More than an hour after most of the violence ended, an Associated Press reporter saw the body lying outside a nearby hospital. It apparently was brought there by police. <p> Five music students from Japan who were attending the 12th Tchaikovsky musical competition nearby were attacked by soccer hooligans, a duty officer at the Japanese embassy in Moscow said. One of the students was injured, but his wounds were not considered serious. <p> The fans, mostly teen-age boys and young men, watched the match on a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Japan defeated Russia 1-0. <p> The riots erupted after Japan scored, but before the match ended. Few police officers were nearby at the time, and they did not arrive until almost an hour later, when most of the aggressive fans had left the area. <p> Firefighters arrived first, and the rioters attacked their trucks. Photographers and cameramen also were beaten. Interfax reported an ambulance was set on fire and a doctor attacked. <p> Once police arrived, some fans tried to help detain the instigators of the riots by overpowering the hooligans and leading them to the police. <p> Aggressive Russian soccer fans, who often sport shaved heads, have in the past gone on rampages in Moscow, but never to such an extent. <p> Sergei Tsoi, spokesman for Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, said that after Sunday 's violence the city would stop showing the matches on big outdoor screens, according to Interfax. It earlier planned to show all of Russia 's World Cup matches. <p> A top government official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice. <p> The riot was " an insult to the millions of people who supported the Russian team, " deputy chief of the Cabinet 's staff Alexei Volin told Interfax. <p> Some politicians criticized the authorities for organizing the public showings of the matches and failing to prepare for possible violence. <p> " Everywhere in the world where fans go on rampages, the police thoroughly prepare for it, " liberal lawmaker Sergei Mitrokhin said on TVS television. " But here the organizers of this event were just irresponsible. " <p> Hooliganism blighted several Russian soccer matches last season. Fans of city rivals Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Moscow fought with each other after their teams played in August. <p> In Japan, fans noisily celebrated on streets and around train stations late Sunday, dancing in circles and chanting " Nippon! Nippon! " <p> " Japan won!
