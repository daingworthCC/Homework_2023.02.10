4060741 There 's a saying that goes around <p> Fort Collins, and it goes like this : <p> " One can never say no to Wendy Ishii. " <p> That 's what Walt Jones said when Ishii talked Colorado State 's new theater-division head into finally writing the sequel to his ubiquitous 1979 Broadway hit, " The 1940s Radio Hour, " for a world-premiere staging at the Bas Bleu Theatre that Ishii co-founded in Fort Collins in 1992. <p> That 's what Dr. Eric Prince said when he saw Ishii perform Samuel Beckett 's " Happy Days " in Canada and in 1987 moved to CSU at Ishii 's urging. <p> That 's what actor-director Jonathan Farwell muttered when he moved from Fort Collins to Ashland, Ore., in 2004. <p> That 's what L.A.-based " High School Musical " and " 1940s Radio Christmas Carol " lyricist Faye Greenberg said just last week after Ishii made her promise to return for a spring fundraiser. <p> Its what visiting guest artists from Israeli to Denver have said for years after having been lured by a woman whose goal is only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A free-spirited instigator <p> One can never say no to Wendy Ishii. That 's one reason she 's The Denver Post Ovation Awards 2008 theater person of the year. It 's a designation Ishii calls " the cognac on top of the champagne. " <p> " People take me seriously when I say things, which always makes me giggle, " said Ishii, who 's not fooling her capitulators. <p> " Wendy has brought professional theater standards and expectations to community theater, and Fort Collins is the lucky recipient, " Jones said. " Not satisfied with standard fare, she draws like- <p> thinking creative teams, casts and audiences. " <p> Ishii is a free spirit who claims not to have a lot of confidence, and even brags about her lack of business acumen. But somehow she 's managed to band together enough believers to have just delivered Bas Bleu 's most artistically realized season in its 16 years, while continuing an ongoing, $3 million grassroots capital campaign toward the purchase of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bas Bleu( French for " blue stockings ") staged five intimate, risk-taking plays this year, including the hostage drama " Someone Who 'll Watch Over Me " and the newly musicalized " Radio Hour " sequel. It hosted the citywide Beckett Project, and won the Colorado Theatre Guild 's Henry Award for outstanding regional theater. <p> The company was designated the area 's fastest-growing business with revenue under $2 million by the Northern Colorado Business Report. That was based mostly on income brought in by its capital campaign, which is closing in on the $1.5 million that will pay off the mortgage. Over the past three years, the money coming in has grown by 300 percent for a theater that runs on a $340,000 annual budget. <p> All this, and she acted <p> All the while, Ishii earned her first " best year by an actress " Ovation Award nomination for playing five challenging roles including a stroke victim, a woman with multiple sclerosis and another literally buried to her neck in sand. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Knowlson, Beckett 's only authorized biographer, called " The best Winnie I have ever seen. " <p> Ishii calls herself " maybe the luckiest actress in the world to have been able to play all those roles in the same year. " <p> And to think it all started when the rising New York stage and screen actress fell in love with a neuroscientist named Doug Ishii, who in 1985 whisked her off to Fort Collins to dedicate his life to teaching and to eradicating Alzheimer 's disease. Wendy Ishii was urged not to follow her love by Broadway director Steve <p> Zuckerman, who told her if she stayed in New York, she would become the next Meryl Streep. <p> " So the deal with my husband was, if I was giving up my career and family and friends, I was going to be a kept woman, " she said. " That meant I was going to lie all day in a hammock and memorize all of Shakespeare. I would have a horse, have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed. " <p> That master plan went far astray in 1992, when Ishii co-founded the then-49-seat Bas Bleu with Eva Wright. She 's rarely been home before 10 p.m. since. Ishii blames it all on a two-margarita lunch. <p> " I told Eva, ' It sounds like we 're talking about starting a theater company, and there was nothing I would rather do less than that, " Ishii said. <p> " Eva asked, ' Well, why not? but after the two margaritas, I could n't remember. And that was that. " <p> Ishii 's scientist husband blames it all on brain chemistry. " I remember one night I got home at 1:20 a.m., after having been at the theater since 8 a.m., cleaning the toilets and doing all the things that you do, " said Ishii, who beat her husband home by 20 minutes. <p> " We were both sitting on the couch exhausted, and I said, ' If we both gave up what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hike on weekends. And without missing a beat, he said, ' No, because of the way our brains are wired. <p> " I just started weeping, " added Ishii, who, you should know, is a bit of a weeper. <p> Bas Bleu 's planned expansion initially called for 150 seats, but Ishii has decided 99 is just right. It allows her to take risks other theaters ca n't. <p> " It seems to me that for every additional seat you put in, you have less artistic choice, " she said. " Staying the size we are now means we can still do things that are challenging and bold and new. " <p> The reason she 's made it 16 years, she thinks, is a combination of tenacity and stupidity and fun. <p> " It 's an adventure, " she said. " There are no guarantees in life, so you do what you love, and you slog on with gusto.
