But, darn it, why ca n't we keep that Arbor Day spirit year-round? <p> We are n't asking you to plant trees right now, just to save a few. In Moraga, a homeowners association wants to ax an oak tree that is 300 years old -- but does n't look a day over 280. In Martinez, an obscure county ordinance is being invoked that could lead to the closure of the wildly popular( especially during Christmas) Alhambra Tree Farm. <p> And we do n't mind wasting a few thousand trees worth of newsprint to tell you about it. <p> -- -- -- <p> TIE A YELLOW RIBBON... : There 's an old oak tree on Ascot Drive in Moraga that could use a benefit concert by Tony Orlando -- and, heck, Dawn, too -- to save its bark. <p> The tree is rooted on common land in the Ascot Highlands development, but its branches spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kondal-ski 's back yard and patio. The Kondalskis say they bought in this development partly because the tree made the yard look so bucolic. <p> " We 've fallen in love with it, " Ann says. " It reminds me of that Swiss Family Robinson tree -- a beautiful, unusual thing. " <p> But when nearly a third of the tree fell last summer, the homeowners association figured the old oak was on its last limbs and decided to break out the chain saw. The Kondalskis balked, and the association hired an arborist from Lafayette to gauge the tree 's health. <p> " He said that, with a little care, the tree could last another eight to 10 years, " Ann says. <p> " But, " counters John Sharpe, president of the homeowners association, " the arborist also said there is disease setting in and it would n't live longer than eight years. We have to be responsible for all the homeowners and do n't want this massive tree falling on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is money. The homeowner 's association has allocated $3,000 for the tree 's removal. If it decided to place support cables on the tree and periodically trim and prune it, the cost would swell to between $4,000 and $7,000. On January 27, the homeowner 's association will vote on whether to charge want this massive tree falling on a house. " <p> Liability is a key issue, as is money. The homeowners association has allocated $3,000 for the tree 's removal. If it decided to place support cables on the tree and periodically trim and prune it, the cost would swell to between $4,000 and $7,000. On January 27, the homeowners association will vote on whether to charge each member a onetime $125 fee to brace the tree. <p> " We 'd like to start a Save the Tree Fund ' or something, " Bob says. " But the association does n't care. I guess it 's the American way of doing things -- something gets old, you get rid of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year, customers at the Alhambra Tree Farm in Martinez are n't just given a receipt after they purchase their trees ; they also get petition postcards to fill out. <p> Owner Peter Jones is embroiled in a dispute with a nearby resident who wants an obscure 1947 zoning ordinance enforced. The ordinance essentially says that anyone selling goods and services, even on a temporary basis, in county areas must go through the bureaucratic hoops and spend a lot of money for a land-use permit. <p> " Ten days before I open up for this Christmas season, they spring this on me, " says Jones, who has been growing and selling trees on Reliez Valley Road since 1969. " They tell me I can only sell what I grow. But about half my business is bringing in noble firs from Oregon. " <p> Jones says he has spent almost $10,000 in bureaucratic wrangling, and he 's doing everything he can to save his farm short of calling in Willie Nelson for a Farm Aid concert. The petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Contra Costa County Community Development Association, which oversees land-use issues. <p> " I 've got two huge stacks( of petition postcards) on my desk, " Pietras says. " Must be hundreds of them. " <p> Pietras says the ordinance " does not address the temporary selling of Christmas trees not grown on the premises. " <p> That might be the loophole Jones could jump through to keep from a lengthy and expensive public zoning process. <p> " Those you-pick cherry places in Brentwood and Oakley will be in the same boat as me if they all of a sudden decide to enforce this thing they never bothered with before, since those farms bring in fruit from other farms, " Jones says. " I feel funny putting on the petitions that we need to save the farm, but I 'm not exaggerating. " <p> -- -- -- WHERE 'S RICHARD AVANZINO WHEN YOU NEED HIM? : So Teresa Whitaker was hanging out at her Dublin home when, suddenly, she heard a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> She entered to investigate and saw a two-foot hole in the ceiling. Then she looked down. There, teeth bared and hissing, was an opossum the size of a fat feline. The little devil apparently had gnawed its way through the attic. <p> " At first I 'm thinking it 's a stuffed animal, " Teresa says. " But when it started moving, I 'm out of there. I called my husband at his office and said, Honey, there 's an opossum in Barbara 's room. ' " <p> Her husband, Rob, called Alameda County Animal Control, which took away the interloper. Teresa says insurance will cover the repairs( " maybe an act-of-opossum clause, " she quips). But she was curious as to the fate of the opossum. So she contacted Animal Control to find out. <p> " The guy said they took it to Tassajara Road and let it go to become coyote food, " Teresa says. " The guy said it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- AN APPLE A DAY... : Here 's the latest from our weird legal case files : In a case that made it all the way to the state Supreme Court, a 15-year-old Walnut Creek student named Gavin T.( last name not given) first was convicted of felony assault, then had the ruling overturned in the state Court of Appeal for the First District. Finally, two weeks ago, the state Supreme Court refused to hear the prosecution 's appeal. <p> Gavin 's crime : apple-throwing. <p> Dum-da-dum-dum... <p> Here 's the story : Gavin and friends were eating lunch at school one day when they entered into a major scientific discussion : How big a splatter would it make if we threw a half-eaten apple at that classroom wall over there? Well, it turned out that it made no splatter at all, because the apple sailed through a foot-long crack in a door and hit the choir teacher in the head, knocking her out for a few minutes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, booked, arraigned, tried and convicted. Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Stevens( no longer on the bench, by the way) found Gavin guilty to " send a message " to other wild apple-throwing youths. <p> Gavin 's lawyers found this ruling rotten to the core. On appeal last August, another judge found that, at most, Gavin was guilty of littering, not felonious assault. So, keep this in mind, kids : There 's now a precedent that an apple is not a deadly weapon. <p> -- -- -- AND FINALLY : While wondering whether the high school baseball team is wooing Gavin as a pitcher, we have a solution for the Save-the-Oak people : Hire Humboldt County activist Julia Butterfly to tree-sit after she descends from her redwood. <p> Sam McManis welcomes column contributions.
