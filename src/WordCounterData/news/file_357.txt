3061041 <p> The Illinois Public Health Department is to be congratulated in its decision to begin HIV name reporting. AIDS activists have long opposed sound medical/public health measures in respect to HIV infection. This opposition has created an epidemic far worse than we would have otherwise experienced had we implemented sound public health measures earlier. <p> As someone who attended the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's consultation on HIV name reporting last year, it was evident that the benefits of reporting far outweigh any negatives. The data presented by Texas and Maryland, which use unique identifiers, were extremely discouraging. Texas officials acknowledged that their results were so bad they would not continue using unique identifiers, and have since gone to name reporting. <p> We need to stop playing games and start practicing medicine in respect to HIV. More than 600,000 cases of AIDS have been reported by name without any breaches in confidentiality. This includes the Florida incident in which a disc of 4,000 names was mailed by a disgruntled employee to several newspapers ; however, none of the names was disclosed, resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been kept confidential in virtually all settings, from doctor 's offices to AIDS groups to insurance companies to the military to public health departments to prisons to virtually anywhere they have been kept. It is a paranoid fear on the part of the AIDS community that this is somehow not the case. People do volunteer to be tested when they have a reason to be regardless of whether there is name reporting. They do not get tested when they do not feel they have been exposed to the virus. HIV reporting and partner notification will lead to more testing, more identification, more treatment and more lives saved. <p> North Carolina has shown that even when anonymous testing is removed, the number of people being tested for HIV increases. Colorado, a state with HIV name reporting and partner notification since 1985, has far more people tested per unit population than either California or New York, the states with the highest number of people with AIDS. The false arguments perpetuated by AIDS activists need to be listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is showing it understands this and will now deal more effectively with the HIV epidemic. <p> Shepherd Smith, founder, <p> Americans for a Sound AIDS/ <p> HIV Policy, Washington, D.C. <p> Take a field trip <p> In a letter( March 5) Doctors Benjamin Gruber and Petra M. Blix reported that they saw no rare plant species during a spring 1997 tour of the Swallow Cliff Restoration Project. They claim the only plants they saw were two non-native weeds, burdock and Canadian thistle. <p> I conducted detailed studies on the vegetation in the restoration work area in 1996 and made a couple of visits in 1997 as well. I wish to inform you that the comments of Gruber and Blix tell your readers more about the plant identification skills of Gruber and Blix than about the vegetation at Swallow Cliff. <p> Within the restoration work area I found 234 species, 197 of which were native. Among the 197 were the purple twayblade( an orchid), lobed blue violet and other species I would describe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant numbers in the work area. <p> I encourage anyone with an interest in the natural communities of Chicago to visit Swallow Cliff this May. Look around. I predict you will see the trillium and spring beauty that the doctors missed. Do n't forget to bring a compass and head directly south from the work area to McCarthy Road or directly east to U.S. 45 so you can see what the preserve was like before the restoration work. <p> Dennis Nyberg, <p> associate professor, <p> Department of Biological <p> Sciences, University of <p> Illinois at Chicago <p> Fables of restoration <p> In several recent columns, letters and an editorial, the Sun-Times has published attacks on a highly respected, widespread program by the Forest Preserve District to return its natural areas to a healthier state. <p> The opponents of restoration have perpetuated the myth of " secrecy " in order to alarm the public. Over the years, both local and major papers -- including the Sun-Times -- have printed numerous articles on the efforts to restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been using several phrases from William Stevens ' book, Miracle Under the Oaks -- taken out of context -- for the last year and a half to try to convince people of some grand conspiracy. The real premise of Stevens ' book is a compelling account of the growing understanding of man 's role as healer of ecosystems under assault, not just in the Chicago wilderness, but around the world. In Stevens ' words, this work has " raised hopes that restoration can be a powerful strategy for preserving biodiversity and the natural functioning of the biosphere. " <p> County Board President John Stroger held public hearings at which citizens, scientists, professional land managers and conservation organizations could offer their comments and questions on the land management program. The testimony at those hearings was 9-1 in favor of restoration. <p> Jane Balaban, Skokie <p> Lovely weeds, though <p> Joyce Kilmer 's most famous poem begins, " I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree.

Polston, <p> Schiller Park <p> A visit to Rome <p> We here know the Art Institute of Chicago is a champion, but it 's nice that the London-based Art Newspaper now knows it, too. And it 's not just the big exhibits that are impressive. <p> Right now, " Bernini 's Rome : Italian Terracottas from the State Hermitage, St. Petersburg " is small and intimate, but it re-creates 17th century Rome with just 35 pieces. It will warm your heart on a cold day, and it 's on view until May 3. Enjoy! <p> Pat Somers Cronin, Beverly <p> Dreams come true <p> Five years ago doctors found that I have multiple sclerosis. When you have MS it 's like you 're on a roller coaster. There are good days and bad days, and then there are the thoughts of the disease 's unpredictable future. Symptoms range from mild tingling sensations and blurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA has approved three drugs to slow the progression of MS, and there are many more being tested in clinical trials. <p> Annette Funicello made a movie, " A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes, " about her personal battle with MS.
