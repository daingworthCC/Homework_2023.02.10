3035641 <p> They 'd had a really good quarter, outperforming the slumping market, and Alexandria investment managers Ron Marsilia and Philip Tasho were eager to strut their stuff before their corporate board in Chicago last Thursday. <p> On the other hand, given the recent terrorist attacks, the men were wary of flying, and the firm 's top executives agreed, telling employees not to fly until the skies were safe again. <p> So the money managers found themselves doing something they had never done before. They rented a room at an HQ Global Workplaces videoconferencing center in Crystal City. And there they made a successful " virtual appearance " at the board meeting, sharing their insights about macroeconomic trends on a television monitor rather than in person. <p> In another example of dark economic clouds having some silver lining, the videoconferencing business is experiencing a boom. To save money, some businesses had already turned to the technology, but in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many more executives are seeing videoconferences as a way to meet with far-flung colleagues or customers without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 boardrooms, the technology is now reaching a whole new, and much wider, business market. <p> " Since the tragedy, our business has doubled, " said Bob Kaphan, president and chief executive of Proximity Video Conferencing in Burlington, Vt. " We hear it over and over again. Either folks are unable to fly, or they are uncomfortable flying, or a lot of companies told employees they should curtail flying except for emergencies. " <p> Companies that have restricted or banned flying and are promoting videoconferencing as an alternative strategy include Prudential Financial of Newark, UnitedHealth Group of Minnetonka, Minn., and Alleghany Asset Management in Chicago, among many others. <p> At Sprint Corp., usage of the company 's videoconferencing lines and equipment jumped 40 percent last week, with the flood of inquiries from prospective clients suggesting the trend will continue, said Becky Replogle-Wilkes, the firm 's director of collaborative applications marketing. " Last week helped us " overcome companies ' fear of the technology, she said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At Essex, Mass. -based Affinity VideoNet, the telephone started ringing off the hook just two days after the attacks, said David Carlson, the firm 's president and co-owner. He said the company had to bring in all its workers to answer the calls as bookings doubled and customer inquiries quadrupled. <p> " The positive side is there 's a lot of calls, " Carlson said. " The difficult side is that it is hard to meet the demand. " <p> The videoconference-industry executives said they viewed the surge with mixed emotions, glad for the business but sad for the cause. " It 's a terrible way of having new business, " Kaphan said. <p> But industry experts, executives and management consultants alike do n't think it is just a temporary phenomenon, a one-time panicked over-response by executives. A person who tries it is likely to do it again, because of the cost and time savings, particularly compared with air travel. <p> Marsilia and Tasho, for example, had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some glitches in the process, they were pleased they had saved almost $ 3,000 -- renting the videoconference room cost $ 200 for an hour, compared with the cost of airline tickets, lodging and meals. <p> The meeting also would have taken them the better part of two days -- flying to Chicago, staying overnight, attending the one-hour meeting and going to the airport to return to the Washington area -- they said. New security procedures would have added to the delays. Instead, the videoconference took two hours, and that included the drive to the videoconference site, parking and the board meeting itself. From now on, Marsilia and Tasho said, they might attend only two of their quarterly meetings in person. <p> " There are times you do n't need to be one-on-one, " Tasho said. <p> Videoconferencing, or transmitting voice and visual images on television monitors in distant locations, once was material for the likes of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. Remember the scene in " 2001 : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talks to his daughter, whose image appears on a monitor in front of him? But in the real world, some of the early technology looked about as sophisticated as a cheesy Ed Wood alien movie : Delayed audio made conversation awkward, slow frame speeds made movements seem herky-jerky, and frequent glitches made the systems unreliable for significant business functions. <p> The new equipment performs better and is easier to use. And even Kinko 's corner copy outlets provide the service on an hourly basis. Executive suites, such as HQ Global Workplace, also offer the services by reservation. <p> Like other sophisticated electronics, the systems keep getting cheaper, with simple desktop models costing as little as $ 1,000. Some new systems operate on personal computers, bringing a simplified version of the technology into home offices as well. Top-end setups, however, can cost as much as $ 60,000. <p> But the technology still is n't perfect. " It 's spotty and not universally great, " said executive recruiter Jan Greenwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Kearney, a nationwide management consulting and executive recruiting firm. " It 's like cell-phone service. " <p> And for first-time users, videoconferencing can be disconcerting. Often the monitor has a split screen, and participants can see themselves as well as all the others. <p> " Newcomers to video do n't like to see themselves, " said Karl Hantho, Reston-based president of Tandberg USA, which makes videoconferencing equipment and product support and service. " They say, ' Wish I 'd cut my hair ' or ' I do n't like my shirt. ' It 's a distraction. " <p> The advent of less-expensive videoconferencing means that workers may soon need to dress in boss-ready fashion in case the CEO suddenly looms on the screen in, say, the worker 's home office in the spare bedroom. <p> Marsilia learned that lesson the hard way on Thursday. Remembering he would not be flying to Chicago but forgetting about the virtual meeting, he had worn a neat but casual shirt and slacks. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day, as his partner, Tasho, the company 's investment manager, rolled his eyes. <p> With no time to change, Marsilia urged Tasho to center stage in the videoconference room, while he sat to the side. When the board members noticed, halfway through the meeting, that he did n't seem to be there, Marsilia put his hand in front of the camera. <p> The board members, whom he describes as an " animated " group of people, laughed and waved back. " They said hello to my hand, " he said, laughing. <p> First-time videoconferencers, particularly job applicants, frequently stumble, Greenwood said. It 's stressful enough interviewing for a job, she pointed out, without having to watch yourself perform on camera for the first time. <p> Once people get the hang of it, however, they sometimes become cheerful converts. Satish Bangera, president for broadband services for Reliance Infocom Inc. in Bethesda, said he began using videoconferencing regularly in 1996, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London and his job required him to oversee construction of satellites in Los Angeles. Rather than keep flying back and forth, he adopted the habit of communicating on the satellites ' progress by videoconference once a week. <p> Now, he said, he speaks regularly with Reliance 's parent company in Bombay, because it helps him reduce expenses and travel time. <p> " Once you get the hang of it, you ca n't live without it, " Bangera said. " You get used to it, and now I do n't think of a day with a videoconference as a special day, just as a regular day. " <p> Even the most enthusiastic videoconferencers and high-tech boosters do n't believe that the technology will replace travel in the long term. Business consultant E.J. Heresniak, writing in the most recent edition of the Conference Board 's magazine, gleefully describes " attending " an analysts meeting in Seattle via webcast on his home computer in Boston, crowing over how he was able to do his laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent hours grappling with their luggage, hailing taxis and waiting in airports to be permitted to board their flights. <p> In an e-mail interview this week, however, Heresniak, a consultant to AOL Time Warner Inc., said that travel carries such a strong allure that it is unlikely that technology of any kind could completely supplant it. <p> " I think many top executives just like to travel and will be reluctant to give it up, " he said. " They wo n't admit it. It makes them feel important, they are ' busy ' for long periods of time and they have talking points about how rough they 've had it when kibitzing with other executives. I remember, at IBM, conversations reciting travel adventures were like bidding wars for the most difficult trip or the most sacrifice, in staying in premier hotels, being pampered at top restaurants, chauffeured around like royalty and cushioned in first class. " <p> Things may be different for middle managers, however, whose budgets are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> And there is still the basic fact that a video appearance ca n't really compare to an in-person contact, the electrochemical greeting that human beings exchange when they meet. <p> " There 's still the bias of meeting and greeting face-to-face, " Greenwood said. <p> She said that some clients will continue to demand that they be able to look business associates straight in the eye, in person. <p> " A client asked me to fly to the Midwest for a one-hour meeting, " she said. " I said, ' Can we do it either by telephone or videoconference? ' He said, ' I 'd prefer not. ' " <p> So, because clients are clients, and remembering who pays the bills, Greenwood will soon be flying to meet with him, as requested.
