5016041 <p> When spring training would come, I 'd grab my glove and rubber ball and throw it against the wall in the basement of our home in Parma. <p> Thud. <p> Thud! <p> THUD! <p> My parents sure loved that sound of spring! Pass the aspirin! <p> I could n't wait to listen to Herb Score doing games from Hi Corbett Field or Scottsdale. It often sounded like Herb was at the bottom of a garbage can with all echo from the lousy radio connections. <p> THE NAME GAME <p> There is a wonderful scene in the movie " City Slickers " where a character start naming baseball players. <p> Actor Daniel Stern then mentions how when he and his father could not communicate about much of anything, they could talk baseball. <p> And sometimes, those conversations are just names, many of them obscure. <p> The Indians now have an outfielder by the name of Jordan Luplow. When they traded for him, I thought of his great-uncle, Al Luplow, who made a sensational catch by leaping over the short wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baseball writer for The Plain Dealer. Even though I had covered the Baltimore Orioles in 1979 for the Baltimore Evening Sun, there was something special about trudging down the old catwalks into the shaky Municipal Stadium press box. <p> I remembered going to games as a kid with my father -- and dreaming of being a writer. <p> Jorge Orta, Rick Manning and Joe Charboneau in the outfield. Andre Thornton was the DH. The infield from third-to-first : Toby Harrah, Tommy Veryzer, Duane Kuiper and Mike Hargrove, with Hassey behind the plate. <p> Dan Spillner started the home opener. Sid Monge was the closer. <p> What did the Indians do when the pitchers and catchers reported in 1980? For the most part, they played catch! Not a lot of them were in peak physical condition. <p> It was not like now, when the Tribe has an elite all-year training facility in Arizona. Guys show up to camp in shape in 2019, and it 's been that way for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least six weeks to analyze the 2019 Tribe. Spring training will soon begin to drag on and on. <p> But someone will emerge as a phenom, or at least a surprising young player. <p> In 1976, The Plain Dealer 's Lebovitz wrote a column predicting Angelo LoGrande would be the team 's next great power hitter. By 1980, he was still in the minors. He had very painful knee, never made the big leagues. <p> I remember a story by The Plain Dealer 's Dan Coughlin hyping Eric Wilkins as the team 's next great starter. A major elbow injury cut short his career. <p> In the early 1960s, Bill Davis was supposed to be a home run hitter for the Tribe. His career was cut short when he blew an Achilles tendon. <p> One spring training, I fell in love with Karl " Pongo " Pagel and wrote about all his long home runs in the thin desert air. That never quite worked out. <p> But looking in my baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to have a team like the 2019 Tribe -- a team with six consecutive winning seasons, four trips to the playoffs. <p> From 1960-93, the Indians never were a serious contender. <p> But PITCHERS &amp; CATCHERS REPORT! was still a special time back then... and it remains so today.
