3053041 <p> Baylor <p> -- Texas A &M; coach R.C. Slocum said Tuesday he would love to make a deal with Baylor 's Chuck Reedy to ensure the Bears would not throw a pass again this week. He even said he might agree to give up A &M's; passing game if Reedy would give up his. <p> To that, Reedy said : " " Deal. I 'd take that deal, but I did n't hear him offer it. We 'd be glad to make a lot of trades, but he 's got more to trade with than we do. "... <p> Meanwhile, Reedy said quarterback J.J. Joe, whose sore right shoulder prevented Baylor from throwing a pass against Southern Methodist, will be able to throw Saturday. <p> " " From everything we can gather, he 'll be able to throw it, " Reedy said. " " It 's just a matter of how much and how many times. " <p> But if Joe can not throw, Reedy said he would not hesitate to play freshman Lamont Moore. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan, " he said. <p> Houston <p> -- The Cougars will not change their alignment to defend Southern Methodist 's run-and-shoot. They have little choice. <p> Many teams load up on defensive backs. But the Cougars have been hit so hard by injuries in the defensive backfield, they probably will use walk-on Stanley Holmes and a fifth defensive back. Cornerbacks John H. Brown, Dedric Mathis and Alfred Young are likely out. <p> " " There are two approaches you can take, " coach Kim Helton said. " " You can leave your big people in and play soft zone and blow the little people up with your big people after the catch. Or you can match up with six defensive backs and stunt and blitz with big people. We 'll have to take the first of the two and stay with our regular people. " <p> Similarly, the injury to running back Lamar Smith will not force Houston 's return to a four-receiver set. <p> Rice <p> -- With 176 points in six games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Fred Goldsmith 's first season as coach. Rice has scored 34 points in five of its past 10 games. Since last season 's game against Texas A &M,; the Owls have scored 334 points, the most in an 11-game stretch for Rice since 1917... <p> Goldsmith is touting linebacker Emmett Waldron as an all-conference player. " " If anybody is a bona fide all-conference linebacker, he is, " Goldsmith said. " " He 's made a ton of tackles. <p> He makes the ones he 's supposed to make and quite a few in schemes that do n't call for him to make the play, too. " <p> SMU <p> -- With Texas Christian and Houston dropping the run-and-shoot, Southern Methodist is the only run-and-shoot team left in the league. And the Mustangs have been more conventional than the other two in their four-receiver set. <p> But coach Tom Rossley said SMU 's schedule has removed much of the advantage from being unique. Rossley can not get a look at how teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And three conference opponents, TCU, Texas and Rice, will have had two weeks to prepare for the Mustangs because of off weeks. <p> But Rossley said SMU will not abandon its version of the run-and-shoot. <p> " " We like the offense, " he said. " " We like what we are able to do with it. We 're not the old, true run-and-shoot. We 're more of a four-wideout offense. We like to run the ball from that formation. We like to play-action. " <p> But SMU ranks last in the SWC in scoring, averaging just 13 points per game. <p> Texas <p> -- The Longhorns have an off week to rest their defensive linemen, who have been playing with assorted strains most of the season. Texas ' run defense ranks last in the SWC. But coach John Mackovic, citing a similar run of injuries at linebacker, said the Longhorns will not change defensive schemes. <p> " " We 've been limited because of personnel, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but we have some injuries and we ca n't make lot of changes. "... <p> Look out, Darrell Royal. Told that some players believe Norman Watkins should be moved back from defensive end to linebacker, Mackovic said, " " We have too many cooks and not enough people who want to do the dishes. " <p> Texas A &M; <p> -- Coach R.C. Slocum said his starting defensive line of ends Eric England and Sam Adams and tackle Lance Teichelman is his best in 15 years as an assistant and five seasons as head coach at A &M; <p> " " This line, as starters, I think is as good as we have had, " Slocum said. " " Back in 1974, ' 75 and ' 76, at one time we had Warren Trahan, Edgar Fields, Tank Marshall, Blake Schwarz, backed up by Jimmy Dean. But across the board, this front line as good as we had. They 're all experienced. They all have good size. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive line, by the way, was backed by a few pretty fair defenders in linebackers Garth TenNapel, Ed Simonini and Robert Jackson and defensive backs Pat Thomas, Lester Hayes and Jackie Williams... <p> Offensive tackle Jason Mathews suffered a broken bone in his hand at Tuesday 's practice. The hand will be placed in a protective cast, and he will play against Baylor on Saturday. <p> TCU <p> -- Coach Pat Sullivan broke third-team freshman quarterback Chance McCarty 's redshirt season Saturday against Rice by using him for one play. He said McCarty would remain his third-team quarterback, but he would find ways to get him into games. <p> " " I think Chance is a talented athlete, " Sullivan said. " " He has big-play ability, but he 's not ready to take over the offense. <p> Chance is a guy, I think, who is too valuable to not see what he can do. We need to do something to get points on the board. Chance is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in basketball or a pinch hitter in baseball. " <p> It 's not difficult to see why Sullivan would be looking for instant offense. Texas Christian has averaged 382.8 yards per game but just 18.8 points... <p> Lenoy Jones, a freshman find as a 190-pound linebacker last season, has been moved back from safety to linebacker. He was moved to his high school position over the summer because he was unable to put on weight, but he clearly was more effective last season. <p> Texas Tech <p> -- Coach Spike Dykes offered another indication of the remarkable progress Rice has made. Of the Owls, Dykes said, " " They really do scare you to death. " And no one thought he was offering another " " Spike-ism. "... <p> The combined 1,126 yards in Tech 's loss Saturday to North Carolina State was the second-highest in Jones Stadium history. <p> Lost amid the numbers : receiver Lloyd Hill set the SWC 's career receiving yardage record, catching seven passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.. <p> Running back Byron " " Bam " Morris is the SWC 's leading rusher with 782 yards, but he has never done much against Rice. He had 30 yards in 1991 and 69 yards last season... Four Tech assistant coaches -- Dean Campbell( secondary), Doyle Parker( tight ends), Ted Unbehagen( offensive line) and Rick Dykes( running backs) are former assistants at Rice.
