5016241 <h> Loudon Wainwright III brings 50 years of musical storytelling to the Kent Stage <p> CLEVELAND, Ohio -- To sons, fathers never really die. For some of us, they stare back in the mirror every morning as we shave or comb our hair( or what 's left of it). For some, it 's a familiar phrase we swore we 'd never repeat... until we do. <p> Loudon Wainwright III knows it all too well. First off, he 's the third Wainwright to bear the Loudon name -- and the last as of now, as he did n't saddle his son, Rufus, with it. But the singer-songwriter, who is really more of a philosopher in 4-4 time, has come his own way of coping with it. <p> " My dad died in 1988, ' ' said Wainwright, who is at the Kent Stage on Thursday, Feb. 28. " We did n't have a great relationship. I would not characterize our relationship as close. It was the typical father-son Oedipal complex. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, now 72, has begun to see more than just vestiges of his father in himself. He even put out an album and did a show called " Surviving Twin ' ' that points to it. It features his songs, but it also features him reading pieces written by his father, a renowned editor and columnist with Life magazine. <p> " When I started to write songs, that idea pleased him because he was a writer, ' ' said Wainwright, on how his father viewed his career as a musician. " He also liked music, but like any parent, he was concerned I would not be able to make a living at it. ' ' <p> Some of that collection may be part of his Kent Stage performance, Wainwright said. But more will delve into a catalog that has been more than 50 years in the making. Of course, most of us know his " Dead Skunk, " off his 1972 album " III. " But there are so many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded over the decades. <p> Some of those became part of a new project, appropriately enough called " Years in the Making. " <p> " ' Years in the Making ' is two discs covering 45 years and 42 tracks, ' ' he said in the telephone interview. " It 's a rarities collection, going back into the early ' 70s. <p> " I spent a lot of time with producer Dick Cornette, listening to music for hours and hours, ' ' he said. " We spent years going through old cassette tapes, reel-to-reel recordings,( computer) hard drives and bootlegs I 'd gotten hold of. ' ' <p> The research may have been time-consuming, but Wainwright is convinced it was worth it. <p> " There are a couple of hidden gems, and it also has some interesting people on it, ' ' he said. " All my kids are on it ' ' -- he is the father of musicians Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright and Lucy Wainwright Roche -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it. ' ' <p> Wainwright said he had Cornette had a system for choosing just what to include. <p> " We made lists : winners, then possible winners, then no( expletive) way, ' ' he said, laughing. " It was just a question of sorting out and deciding what was the best stuff. ' ' <p> A look back at music over that much time could be a learning experience for most of us. But Wainwright said he did n't really view the experience as an opportunity for growth. <p> ' I 'm the same guy I was back then, ' ' he joked. " I just look different. The anxieties, fears, interests, what pisses me off and what amuses me is much the same. " <p> That 's especially interesting because as a true folkie -- though he 's ventured into just about every genre but hip-hop -- he 's always written deeply personal songs, because he believes there 's a commonality in all of us. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spotlight it. <p> " I 've always had a tendency to present and expose myself to a degree, ' ' he said. " All I 'm doing is singing about my life, and my life is quite similar to anyone else 's. There 's nothing exotic or weird about my life. <p> " All I do is describe it, and that 's where the skill set comes in, ' ' Wainwright said. " I turn it into a three-minute song, and the listener ideally connects with it. ' ' <p> Even without having to see his own reflection in the mirror in the morning.
