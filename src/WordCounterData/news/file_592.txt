4133141 Each time Larry Brown encountered someone in North Carolina 's vast basketball fraternity this season, he spoke of the importance of a large gathering of former Tar Heels visiting Dean Smith after the Final Four. Time, Brown knew, was running short. Then came Roy Williams ' phone call early Sunday morning. And a few hours later, Brown still was struggling to compose himself while sharing stories about the man who -- even at Brown 's age of 74 -- he still refers to only as Coach Smith. Brown, a Hall of Fame coach who played for and coached under Smith at North Carolina, knows as well as anyone that highlighting Smith 's accolades -- the 11 Final Four appearances and two national titles, the 879 victories and 13 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament titles -- does n't begin to tell the story about the impact of the coaching icon who died Saturday night. It is a legacy of selflessness and humility. Eighty-three years of caring and giving. " We 'll never have another one like him, " Brown told USA TODAY Sports. " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without question. I try every day to be like him, and I always fall short. " Smith was a private man who shrunk from adoration and extended his hand to help any of his former players or coaches at any time. He never forgot a name. He had the unique ability to treat all of his former players the same regardless of playing status. " Whether you were Michael Jordan or James Worthy or the freshman manager, you are all part of his family, and that family was his team, " Billy Packer, a former CBS analyst who broadcast both of Smith 's national titles, told USA TODAY Sports. " It not only took place for the moment or the year or the era, it lasted for a lifetime. Nobody that I 've ever been around did that to the degree that he did. " President Obama on Sunday recognized Smith in a statement as not just a coaching legend but also a " gentleman and a citizen. " Smith graduated more than 96% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to play in the NBA or ABA, but he carved out as much time to talk with walk-ons. In 1986, he wanted the name of the Dean E. Smith Center to honor the players, not him. He loathed showboating and individualism. He encouraged players who scored to point to the teammate who made the assist. His philosophy boiled down to six words : " Play hard ; play together ; play smart. " He offered thoughts of the day before every practice. " He taught, " Packer said, " but it seemed like he never stopped learning. " Smith, who coached at North Carolina for 36 years, did n't use profanity. He did n't allow it in practice. He would admonish players, but not publicly. He interrupted whatever he was doing to meet with a player -- any player -- if he showed up at his office. " His concern for people will be the legacy I will remember most, " current coach Williams said in a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility. When he won his first national championship in 1982, in his seventh Final Four, he told then-assistant Williams that he was no better a coach than he was the day before. Among his most heated rivals was former Maryland coach Lefty Driesell, who once refused to shake Smith 's hand after a game. But when Driesell told his son Chuck, coach at The Citadel, one coach to emulate, he did n't name himself. He said to follow Smith. " I always used to open my mouth and say the wrong thing, " Driesell said. " He always said the right thing. Emulate him. I was n't really friendly with him. But I always respected him. His players just love him. " The son of Kansas schoolteachers, Smith grew up in the Depression era yet learned racial tolerance, the understanding that you treat each person with dignity. At North Carolina, he enlisted Brown, then an assistant, to help with the recruitment of All-American Charlie Scott, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " He did n't care about the consequences, " Brown said. " He just felt it was the right thing to do. And that 's how he led his life. " To that point, Smith lobbied for freshmen ineligibility because he thought that would enable them to best adjust to college academically and socially. He nudged Jordan toward the NBA rather than try to persuade him to stay for his senior year. The cruelest twist was that Smith was robbed of one of his greatest attributes -- his picture-perfect recall and memory -- as he battled dementia in his final years. Driesell grew closer to Smith after their coaching days, so much so that Driesell, who is also 83, began to call Smith every couple of weeks. Recently, Driesell said he would call Smith 's secretary and be told that he could talk to him but that Smith would n't know who he was. Driesell wants to attend the funeral. " I just know there will be a million people there, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't think about the lives Smith touched, including his. The wallpaper on Brown 's cellphone is a picture of Smith cutting down the nets after winning the 1982 national title. " He lived his life the way he expected us all to live our lives, " Brown said. " He is the greatest teacher I 've ever been around. " --- " Coach Smith showed us something that I 've seen again and again on the court -- that basketball can tell us a lot more about who you are than a jump shot alone ever could. " He graduated more than 96% of his players and taught his teams to point to the teammate who passed them the ball after a basket. He pushed forward the civil rights movement, recruiting the first black scholarship athlete to North Carolina and helping to integrate a restaurant and a neighborhood in Chapel Hill. " And in his final years, Coach Smith showed us how to fight an illness with courage and dignity. For all of that, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( the) Medal of Freedom in 2013. " President Obama " Other than my parents, no one had a bigger influence on my life than Coach Smith. He was more than a coach -- he was my mentor, my teacher, my second father. Coach was always there for me whenever I needed him, and I loved him for it. " Michael Jordan Dean Smith was the most innovative and player-loved coach of his time. Tweet from Kentucky coach John Calipari " His greatest gift was his unique ability to teach what it takes to become a good man. That was easy for him to do because he was a great man himself. All of his players benefited greatly from his basketball teachings but even more from his ability to help mold men of integrity, honor and purpose. " Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski " Dean Smith was the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been. We love him, and we will miss him. " North Carolina coach Roy Williams " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most importantly those wins came while teaching and living the right values. He won, his players graduated and he played by the rules. He was first and foremost a teacher, and his players were always the most important part of his agenda.... " Sometimes the word legend is used with too little thought. In this instance, it almost seems inadequate. " ACC Commissioner John Swofford " He was willing to take controversial stands on a number of things as a member of our church -- being against the death penalty, affirming gays and lesbians, protesting nuclear proliferation. He was one who has been willing to speak out on issues that many might hesitate to take a stand on. " Robert Seymour, former pastor at Binkley Baptist Church in Chapel Hill Sending my prayers and deepest sympathies to Dean Smith 's family. May we celebrate the gift we all were given with his life.
