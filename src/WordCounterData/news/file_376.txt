3065041 <p> The saga of Eric Gordon, one of the consensus top three high school players in the country, is finally over. He has backed out of his commitment to the University of Illinois and made a new one to Indiana University. And we all know what they say about a man and his word. <p> This is devastating for Illini coach Bruce Weber. You have to wonder whether he has what it takes to land a major big-time player. And it 's going to be life-altering news to the Illinois fans who have filled the chatrooms for months, calling Hoosiers coach Kelvin Sampson dirty names, Gordon a liar and the people from Indiana the great unwashed. Indiana fans have fought back in their own chatrooms in a modern recruiting rumble. <p> I want to give my take on this thing, but first I have to wash my hands. This story does that to me. <p> Weber would n't talk about Gordon as Illinois opened practice Friday. NCAA rules prohibit him from talking now about specific recruits, so he said he would " talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of practice with " having a real life. " <p> Yes, this Gordon thing was surreal. It was about two grown basketball coaches and thousands of grown basketball fans fighting over a child, begging him, pleading, praying. We know it 's wrong to go so overboard about our kids, and we get this message all the time when the kids crumble. Really, though, how are the Illini going to survive without him? <p> While at dinner once with the late and legendary college coach Jack Hartman, I asked him why he had retired when he did. Turned out, he could n't bring himself, a grown man, to go into a kid 's living room to beg anymore. It was just too demeaning. <p> In the 10 years or so since then, times have changed, and the begging has taken in modern technology. Here 's what it came down to with Gordon : <p> This is a dirty, slimy, scummy business, and it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sampson won the battle. And when I said Weber might not have what it takes for this stuff, that was n't entirely an insult. <p> Weber is going to have a hard time getting past this. He has been fighting this whole hayseed thing ever since he got to Illinois. He spent too many years as an assistant at Purdue and as the head coach at Southern Illinois to be seen as a big-timer. Illini basketball is always one step behind the true elite. It 's frustrating. And while I never understood the infatuation with Bill Self, the Illini nation thought it had a hero in him because of his smooth image and ESPN appearances. It seemed devastating when he left and worse when he was replaced by a guy from Carbondale. <p> Stupid stuff, but fans did n't believe in Weber and players did n't listen. It helped when he got to the national championship game in 2005, but he was doing it with Self 's players, right? Self, by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Weber still ca n't entirely get past this. He needed a statement, and that was Gordon. Land the biggest of big fish, and others would follow. <p> Gordon 's commitment to Illinois was Weber 's ticket. But it was a non-binding, oral commitment. And then Indiana hired Sampson, who immediately ran to his phone to ask Gordon to reconsider. <p> The fight was between Sampson and Weber. And Sampson proved to be the better man. When I say " better, " I 'm saying he was more effective in the dirty, slimy, scummy world. <p> I 'm not sure Weber has the inner dirtbag for this kind of stuff. And if he does n't, then Illinois will suffer. Weber is a good man and a good coach, and that just does n't sell. <p> I have to wash my hands again. <p> These early oral commitments have developed over the years as a way of helping kids get through all the daily phone calls, e-mails or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and get back to the usual teenage stuff to worry about. <p> And in came Sampson, fresh to a new job after leaving Oklahoma in trouble for his dirty recruiting scandal. <p> There is no battle with the inner dirtbag for Sampson. While with the Sooners, he had been busted by the NCAA for making phone calls to recruits when rules prohibited it. How many calls? Not five. Not 10. Two hundred thirty-three. He built his teams -- and his name -- on cheating. His success at Oklahoma led to the Indiana job, one of the truly elite jobs. <p> The Hoosiers knew what they were getting. They know he knows how to play the game. <p> This is what he said when the NCAA ruled against him : " I have learned an invaluable lesson, and I hope that this reinforces to other coaches the importance of every aspect of NCAA compliance. " <p> I have to wash my hands. <p> Sampson was punished, too. He ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long do you think it took him to realize that text messages were the way around the ban? <p> So he hired Gordon 's dad 's college coach as an assistant. Then he is said to have hired Gordon 's AAU coach in some capacity that allowed him to slip around rules limiting contact with players. <p> Sampson earned this. <p> You know, Gordon apparently has found this whole thing upsetting. And if Weber thought about it, he would realize the official signing date has n't actually come and Gordon 's " commitment " is still soft. Meanwhile, the kid is a little vulnerable. <p> But I doubt Weber will think that through. He 's not the right man for that. <p> Letters to our sports columnists appear Sunday.

Went straight to NBA and was taken fourth overall by Clippers. Weber entered late because he was just hired and did n't have full recruiting cycle. <p> Julian Wright <p> Homewood-Flossmoor, 2005 <p> Choice : Kansas <p> Down to Illinois and Arizona before Kansas coach Bill Self swooped in and stole him with a home visit. <p> Justin Dentmon <p> Carbondale, 2005 <p> Choice : Washington <p> Signed with Illinois State.
