3055341 <p> Leave it to former Texas Gov. Ann Richards to give President Clinton a taste of what life might be like if his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is elected to the Senate. <p> At a dinner honoring fund-raiser Terrence McAuliffe, Richards gave Hillary Clinton top billing when she welcomed the first couple. <p> The former governor introduced Hillary as " the next junior senator from New York... and, of course, her lovely husband, Bill. " <p> Asked later if he could settle for being just a political spouse, Clinton answered with a hearty " absolutely! " <p> Imagining the president at events for Senate spouses " just brings an enormous smile to my face, " said Hillary Clinton, who 10 days ago announced that she plans to form an exploratory committee for the race. <p> Speaking at the event, which raised more than $ 3 million for the Democratic National Committee, Clinton said the Senate spouses club might be a better deal than serving in the Senate itself, which has a GOP majority. <p> " No offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there, if I were given the choice I 'd rather be in the spouses ' club, " Clinton quipped to the Senate minority leader, who also attended the dinner. <p> <p> An award for ' hogging of the podium ' <p> And the bronze medal goes to : the ever loquacious Sheila Jackson Lee. <p> George, the political magazine published by John F. Kennedy Jr., ranked Houston Democrat Jackson Lee at No. 3 on its list of " Top 10 Publicity Hounds " in Washington. <p> " Few phrases inspire more groans on Capitol Hill than ' I yield my time to the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee. ' Her hogging of the podium on the House floor is legendary ; insiders say she 'll speak about absolutely anything, " the magazine said. <p> Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch, who can produce more faxes than just about anyone in Washington topped the list. Law professor Jonathan Turley, a ubiquitous television presence during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, came in at No. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dictionary says the word " sequence " means logical order, something that 's not always found in White House press briefings. <p> Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, was asked three times last week - and managed to avoid directly answering - whether Russian President Boris Yeltsin specifically asked President Clinton to stop bombing Yugoslavia. <p> " There was some discussion about how this will all play out and sequencing, " Lockhart said. He repeatedly employed this conflict 's favorite word, " sequencing, " to cover the timing between Yugoslav troop withdrawals and the pause in NATO bombing. <p> On the fourth attempt to clarify Yeltsin 's remarks, Lockhart responded : " It 's fair to say that I think that if one plus one equals two, and I 've given you one and one, then it should equal two. " OK, now that 's logical, not to mention clear. <p> <p> Judge dismisses lawsuit against Clinton <p> A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Texas Rep. Ron Paul and 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority when he ordered the U.S. military to participate in the bombing of Yugoslavia. <p> Paul, a Surfside Republican, and the other lawmakers claimed that Clinton violated the 1973 War Powers Act when he authorized U.S. involvement in the NATO airstrikes. <p> The Vietnam War-era legislation, which has been ignored by presidents of both parties, requires congressional approval for the " introduction into hostilities " of U.S. forces for more than 60 days. The NATO air campaign began March 24. <p> U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman did not address the merits of the claim when he dismissed the lawsuit on Tuesday. Instead, the judge said the House members lacked the legal standing to sue. <p> In their lawsuit, the 31 lawmakers, including four Democrats, noted a 213-213 vote on April 28 that fell short of authorizing U.S. participation in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Another vote that day rejected a resolution declaring a state of war between the two countries. The lawmakers claim that Clinton ignored both votes by continuing with the bombing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about U.S. involvement in the air attacks. The judge noted that Congress later defeated a bill that would have removed U.S. troops from Yugoslavia. It also passed an emergency spending bill to help pay for the bombing campaign. <p> <p> Gramm attempts free verse for a fee <p> When raising money, some politicians occasionally pretend they 're not doing what they 're doing ; namely, raising cold, hard cash. They pretend they cherish you as a friend, they value your profound advice - and, yes, they 'd love a little financial help. <p> Texas Sen. Phil Gramm is more direct. But his directness, in a recent invitation to a $ 1,000-a-person fund-raiser, was tempered with a bit of poetry. <p> With the help of his chief of staff, Ruth Cymber, the College Station Republican wrote the following to potential participants in a July 1 " Texas B-B-Q lunch " at the National Republican Senatorial Committee : <p> " You hold a place <p> Within my heart. <p> It 's been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart is full. <p> I long for you. <p> I 've missed your smile <p> and money, too. <p> So here 's a date <p> for us to meet <p> to toast good times <p> and memories sweet. <p> Just say yes <p> and with panache <p> I 'll buy the beer <p> with your cash. " <p> Between 75 and 100 people are expected to attend the event, which will help Gramm fund his bid for re-election in 2002. <p> <p> McCain video draws paper 's attention <p> It appears that Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign took a few creative liberties in producing a video about the life of the former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war. <p> The Arizona Republic reported recently that some of the scenes in the video, such as one of McCain parachuting to earth after his plane was shot down in Vietnam was actually stock footage of someone else. Also, a scene of an angry group poised to mob the unconscious McCain was also a generic shot of Vietnamese people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, told the Phoenix newspaper that there was no attempt to mislead. <p> " I do n't know any footage that exists showing John McCain parachuting from the plane, " he said. " We have to put something up there that represents what 's going on. " <p> The video, which traces the GOP candidate 's career in the military and as a lawmaker from Arizona, even touches, albeit lightly, on his divorce from his first wife. " Like a lot of prisoners of war, his marriage ended " several years after his return from Vietnam, according to the video. <p> The video has been sent to 50,000 New Hampshire voters. <p> <p> ' Six million dollar man ' helps senator <p> Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., enlisted the help of the bionic man last week in challenging the constitutionality of limits on campaign contributions. The senator argued the political process is harmed because the financial restrictions have not even kept up with inflation. <p> " If the show " The Six Million Dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $ 20 million, " said McConnell as he referred to the fictional 1970s television hero played by actor Lee Majors. " But the federal contribution limit of $ 1,000( per person per candidate) has remained unchanged since 1974. " <p> What was a $ 1,000 contribution in 1974 is now worth $ 302 - hardly enough to begin financing a vigorous campaign, the senator said. <p> McConnell, who chairs the fund-raising National Republican Senatorial Committee, delivered his comments after filing a legal brief with the Supreme Court supporting a free-speech challenge to Missouri 's limits on campaign contributions. <p> The justices will hear arguments in the case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, this fall or early next year. A ruling is likely by July 2000.
