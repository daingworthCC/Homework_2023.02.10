3005541 @ @ @ @ @, " said Jed Srybnik, sneering dismissively from a perch atop the leather seat of his customized cobalt blue Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle. " Look at those bad boys on their bikes. " <p> Just a moment before, Mr. Srybnik had been gauging the effect his motorcycling had on the opposite sex : " What the women see in you is the danger, " he said. But then a tooth-rattling roar split the air like a thunderclap on what was an otherwise sunny Saturday afternoon. Past where Mr. Srybnik sat -- in a line of bikes parked in front of the restaurant I Tre Merli on West Broadway, just below Houston Street -- two leather-clad bikers cruised by on their Harleys, looking as if they had come to SoHo to pillage, not brunch. As they passed, forks froze in transit at the restaurant 's sidewalk tables. On the crowded streets, strollers stood still and gawked. <p> " Did you see that guy 's jacket? " Mr. Srybnik said when the riders had moved on and conversation was again possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was probably a $30,000 bike. The only place that guy 's dangerous is in the commodity trading pits. " <p> Mr. Srybnik is a friendly 36-year-old who is not exactly in the danger business, either. He works for his family 's machine-tool manufacturing company in Brooklyn. Soon, he would jam on his helmet and roar off, too, looking the bad boy himself in his boots and blue jeans with the " Born to Ride " belt buckle, black T-shirt and leather vest. <p> A rider for the last seven years -- he said he took it up to get over a love affair -- Mr. Srybnik is one of a legion of bikers who can be spotted( and heard, certainly) with their motorcycles outside the trendier places in SoHo each weekend, or in the Hamptons in summer. Soldiers in a volunteer army, they carry the Harley-Davidson banner not only on the roadways, but also to the ramparts of fashion and style. <p> In recent years, these " mild bunches, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their midlife crises with the roars of Harleys are called, have proliferated. The Gotham City Riders roar out of Wall Street and Madison Avenue. Out of the West come the Rolex Riders, from the movie studios and talent agencies of Hollywood. <p> One of the most publicized groups is an informal gang that has formed around Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, and Robert Pittman of Time Warner. In this circle, having a motorcycle-riding instructor( in this case Gasper Trama, of Trama 's Auto School, in Woodhaven, Queens) is starting to replace having a personal trainer as a status symbol. <p> " Motorcycling does n't have a lot to do with transportation, " said Willie G. Davidson, whose grandfather was one of the Davidson brothers who helped found the company in Milwaukee in 1903. As Harley 's vice president for styling, Mr. Davidson works with nuts and bolts, engine blocks and gas tanks. But the peculiar market position Harley-Davidson holds makes it a job he once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> When the Guggenheim Museum in SoHo asked 63 architects and designers to choose objects for a show in November to be called " Industrial Elegance, " the architect Robert A. M. Stern chose a Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail. <p> " Harley-Davidson has a mystique, " Mr. Davidson said. " It 's turned into a life style. " <p> On Tuesday, the marketing of the motorcycle mystique continues with the opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe at 56th Street and Avenue of the Americas. As its nearby brethren, the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood, did with rock-and-roll and movies, the Harley-Davidson Cafe will attempt to take a phenomenon that is rich in images and associations and offer it to the public for the mere price of a hamburger. Of course, T-shirts imprinted with the restaurant 's logo are extra. <p> " Actually, we 'll have T-shirts, sweatshirts, baseball caps and jackets, " said Marc Packer, the Harley-Davidson Cafe 's president, who is using the Harley-Davidson name under license from the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delicatessen and Canastel 's, <p> The three-tiered, 14,000-square-foot Harley-Davidson Cafe is being billed by its owners as the world 's first " interactive " restaurant. What this seems to mean is that amid the normal rock music there will be the piped-in sounds of revving Harleys( for Harley aficionados, louder is better), ersatz exhaust smoke, vintage bikes on display, a giant American flag that publicity material says will " appear to ripple in the wind " and a real Harley bolted to the floor, on which patrons can make videotapes of themselves " riding " in front of famous backdrops, like Route 66. <p> If anyone can think of eating with all this interaction going on, the menu features what Mr. Packer calls " gourmet road food, " with items like a barbecued Portobello mushroom sandwich, cycle-wheel pasta primavera and a pork-loin sandwich called the " Harley Hog. " Scattered about will be vintage photographs of celebrity Harley-Davidson riders from the company 's archives in Milwaukee. It 's the Harley experience, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen 's barbecue pit. <p> Does all this mass marketing offend purists? " I do n't have a problem with this, ' said Martin Jack Rosenblum, one of Harley-Davidson 's archivists, who worked on the cafe project. Mr. Rosenblum is a longtime Harley rider and a former English professor, with a Ph.D. He wears black jeans and Harley belt buckles with his tweed jackets and has published a book of poetry, " The Holy Ranger "( Lion Publishing, 1989), which is devoted to what he calls the " Harley mythos. " <p> The Harley-Davidson company is certainly not shy about furthering its image. Thomas G. Parsons, the company 's director of trademark licensing, said the company realized about 10 years ago that its image was being furthered without approval through the widespread unauthorized use of its trademark on what he called " lousy products -- coke spoons, and a lot of obscene T-shirts. " So Harley-Davidson started to license in earnest. <p> " We 're chasing Coca-Cola as a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to keep up with high-fashion designers who have been appropriating the biker look for years. In 1991, the runways in Paris and New York looked like biker rallies, as Karl Lagerfeld, Claude Montana and Anne Klein put zippers and Harley-inspired emblems on everything. That year, Bloomingdale 's had a " Bad and Beautiful " shop devoted to women 's motorcycle jackets and the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave Harley-Davidson a special award for its influence on fashion. <p> Mr. Parsons said that these days, licensing requests are pouring in to Harley-Davidson from manufacturers of everything from inflatable boats to cereal, beef jerky and even toilet paper. " We 've turned down gravestones, " Mr. Parsons said, " although at one point in the mid-80 's we were ready to put our name on a condom. It was something that Liz Taylor was involved in with her AIDS-awareness work. " That item never appeared. <p> Harley-Davidson has been producing things to wear since the First World War. If Mr. Davidson is surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter, Karen Davidson, is in it with both boots. Ms. Davidson is the primary designer for the 400-item Harley-Davidson Motorclothes collection, a leather-heavy line that stretches far beyond the traditional motorcycle jacket( of which there are now more than three dozen styles) to include denim shirts with logos, women 's lace bodysuits, boxer shorts and a 12-item children 's clothing line. <p> Last year, according to company figures, Motorclothes sales revenues increased 45 percent, to $49 million -- and it estimates that 20 percent of the customers were n't motorcycle riders. " Some of the clothes are purely functional, " said Jack Sichterman, an executive at Motorclothes, " but the whole life style we 're talking about is more than just riding. Fashion is as important as putting gas in the gas tank. " <p> A recent demographic profile of Harley-Davidson motorcycle buyers in the United States, compiled by the company, shows that over the last eight years their median age has climbed to just under 40 ; the percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the median annual household income has topped $50,000. Company officials admit that the new breed of Harley rider has threatened to alienate some of the original cult members -- a wilder bunch who had, perhaps, more cause to be rebels. <p> " Yeah, " said Willie G. Davidson, " the yuppies -- or I guess they call them rubbies, " a term that come from " rich urban bikers. " " I want there to be room for all of them. I do n't want to irritate any of them. <p> But, he added, " if I see one more of those articles about rubbies, I 'm going to puke. " <p> Two weeks before the opening of the Harley-Davidson Cafe, Mr. Packer climbed into his chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz sedan( he keeps a Harley at his home in the Hamptons, he says) and headed to the estate in New Jersey that belonged to Elizabeth Taylor 's best-known riding companion, the late Malcolm S. Forbes ; it is still in the Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired a good number of rubbies. <p> The Forbes company, which now mostly uses Mr. Forbes 's more than 50 motorcycles to entertain advertisers in its flagship magazine, had agreed to lend one of the Harley-Davidsons for display in Mr. Packer 's restaurant. " Where did Liz Taylor sit? " Mr. Packer asked as he surveyed a garage full of shiny bikes of all varieties. He was told that Miss Taylor 's favorite purple motorcycle had been given to her husband, Larry Fortensky. <p> After much looking around, Mr. Packer chose a bike Mr. Forbes had ordered just before he died, a huge custom-made Harley 1990 Ultra-Classic Tour Glide, painted in Mr. Forbes 's favorite color -- green -- and equipped with a sound system that seemed as though it could have filled the entire 14,000 square feet of the Harley-Davidson Cafe. The Forbes bike will join the display of seven vintage motorcyles on loan from Harley-Davidson and a few bikes owned by celebrities, including, Mr. Packer said, Billy Joel and Jay Leno. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there, at least on opening night. <p> " Donald Trump called me himself, " Mr. Packer said. " He 's coming. " <p> Mr. Srybnik, who creates his own personal Harley-Davidson Cafe nearly every weekend simply by parking his customized Softail on the streets of New York, plans to be there as well. <p> Davidson Motorclothes.( Chris Corsmeier for The New York Times) ; In recent years, the " mild bunches " have proliferated, especially along West Broadway in SoHo.( Ed Quinn)
