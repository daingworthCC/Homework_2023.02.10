Tom Dodge/Dispatch <p> When tanker trucks crash and oil rigs rupture, a cleanup system kicks in to protect the environment from petroleum, chemicals and drilling fluids. <p> Those contaminants ca n't stay on the roadside or in a field, tainting the soil and potentially reaching waterways, so specialized crews dig them up and cart them away. <p> An example is a recent brine spill in Morrow County. A train slammed into a truck hauling wastewater from an oil and gas well near Mount Gilead, shearing the truck in half and spilling diesel fuel and 3,200 gallons of drilling wastewater across the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck driver was flown to a Columbus hospital and the wreckage was cleared, the cleanup started. A team from Environmental Management Specialists Inc., which has offices across Ohio and in Indianapolis, was called in. <p> Drilling wastewater is not classified as a hazardous material as long as it does n't contain any of a laundry list of chemicals, said James Lee, a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The Morrow County waste came from a conventional oil and gas well, not from a well that had been developed through hydraulic fracturing. The " fracking " process involves injecting toxic chemicals and sand into a well at high pressure to crack rock formations and release oil and gas. Lee said no hazardous materials were at the Morrow County crash site. <p> Nick Adams, business-development manager at Environmental Management Specialists, said workers used an excavator to dig up contaminated soil and dump it into trucks. Soil affected by only brine water could end up in a landfill ; soil contaminated with diesel fuel probably would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spill involved hazardous waste, that would have had to go to a special landfill or incinerator. The EPA lists 20 facilities in Ohio that accept hazardous waste ; none is in Franklin County. <p> In the case of the Morrow County spill, though, a hazardous-waste facility was unnecessary. " There were n't a whole lot of safety concerns " from that spill, Adams said. <p> Franklin County has a soil-recycling facility : Ohio Soil Recycling on Columbus ' South Side. Chris Elliott, the owner, explained the process during a recent tour of the 70-acre facility near Alum Creek and Interstate 70. The EPA has issued air permits for eight such sites in Ohio. <p> Environmental-cleanup companies haul contaminated soil to the facility and show a manifest that explains what is in the soil. Ohio Soil confirms the list of contaminants, and the soil is dumped at the facility, which is lined and is surrounded by trenches to protect surrounding land and water. <p> Ohio Soil then sprays the soil with concentrated microbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what nature eventually would do on its own. The process can take months. The soil is then tested in a laboratory. If it comes back clean, it can be used as normal soil. <p> At Ohio Soil, which is built on an old Franklin County landfill and Superfund site, the soil stays there : It is used to level out the old spaces. <p> " The facility looks like a composting facility, " Elliott said. " We monitor oxygen, water content, that kind of thing. What we 're doing is what Mother Nature would do on her own over tens of thousands of years. "
