3000341 <p> In the airy sitting room of the ranch house where he has lived for 48 years, Byron Nelson holds a picture in his gnarled hands and peers back through time. In the frame, a lean young man is in the perfect golf position, his arms extended and the shaft of his club bowed, head behind the ball, body in absolute balance. <p> Nelson 's gaze lingers on the frame, and the deep lines of his face are reflected in the glass. He is the man with the tie and the starched shirt in the old black-and-white photo, swinging with a tensile strength that fairly leaps through the decades and out of the picture ; he is the man with the bad hip sitting with his cane at arm 's length. He shakes his head slowly, puts a finger to his lips and smiles. <p> " I do n't know about you, " he says in a voice strong and full of Texas, " but I do n't see anything at all wrong with that swing. " <p> Not that Byron Nelson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing this 83-year-old man would do. It 's not his style. This is about substance. This is the golf swing that inspired the United States Golf Association to name its driving robot " Iron Byron. " It is the swing that produced 52 United States tournament victories in an abbreviated career. And it is the swing that, 50 years ago, launched Nelson on the most remarkable streak in the history of this, and perhaps any other, sport. <p> With this swing, Byron Nelson won 11 straight golf tournaments in 1945. Eleven straight. It has never been approached. The closest any golfer has come was Jackie Burke Jr., who won four straight back in 1952. And with this golden anniversary of Nelson 's unprecedented achievement, the spotlight once again has focused on this quiet man from Fort Worth. During the months and weeks leading up to this weekend 's GTE Byron Nelson Classic at the Four Seasons Resort at Las Colinas, Nelson figures he has done many more interviews than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I 'm complaining, " he said. " It still amazes me. Can you imagine? All this about something a man did 50 years ago? But I 've enjoyed it, enjoyed thinking about it and talking about it. " <p> Nelson 's eyes are clear and his hands -- those huge, calloused hands that made golf grips look like pencils -- are steady. People used to say the hands are what gave him so much control, what enabled him to keep the club on line longer than anyone before or since. No telling. But during one day recently, he signed 1,520 advance copies of his " Little Black Book, " a fascinating compendium of his notes beginning with the 1935 season, and the signature never varied. <p> Consistency has always been Nelson 's hallmark. Some of the numbers from his career seem unreal. During one stretch in the 1940 's, he made 113 straight cuts around the world, a record that still stands. His career lasted just 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 victories. They are Sam Snead( 81), Jack Nicklaus( 70), Ben Hogan( 63) and Arnold Palmer( 60). And only Nicklaus was able to approach the number of tournament victories in the United States during his first 11 years on tour. Nicklaus won 51 in that stretch. <p> As impressive as those figures are, they pale next to those from the Streak. That year, Nelson not only won 11 straight. He won 18 of the 30 tournaments he entered. He finished second seven times and was out of the top five just once. His stroke average for the year was 68.33, an all-time record and nearly a full stroke better than Snead 's second-place total of 69.23. Maybe the most mind-boggling number of all is Nelson 's final-round stroke average. In crunch time, he shot an average score of 67.45. <p> " The final-round stroke average, that 's really the reason why I won so much as I did, " he said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snead did at Charlotte, when he bogeyed the last hole and then I won the playoff, that was a break. He could have scrambled around, gotten a par at the last hole and then that would have been the end of it. The whole streak would have stopped at one. " <p> It all began uneventfully enough, with Byron and his running mate Jug McSpaden, the Gold Dust Twins, winning the Miami Four Ball by beating Denny Shute and Sam Byrd, 8 and 6. Nothing unusual there. Nelson and McSpaden were a formidable team and played a lot of golf together since they both were rejected by the military during the war, Nelson for a blood problem and McSpaden for severe sinusitis. <p> One of the things to note about the first victory is the presence of Hogan in the field. Critics of Nelson 's accomplishments often point to what they say were war-depleted fields during the 1945 season. While it 's obviously true that some good players were off to war, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hogan played in 18. <p> " All of that talk about no competition never really bothered me, " Byron said, " because, you see, I know how I played. Maybe I would n't have won 18 tournaments, or 11 in a row, but I played wonderfully well. " <p> He surely did. During the 11 victories that stretched from early March through early August, Nelson won by an average of seven strokes. There were only three real scares. The first was during tournament No. 2 at Charlotte, when Snead 's three-putt bogey at the last hole allowed Nelson to tie him at 272 and then defeat him after two 18-hole playoff rounds, 69-69 to 69-73. The second scare came during victory No. 7, in June at the Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation, when Nelson had to birdie five of the last six holes to shoot 63 and beat McSpaden by two strokes. <p> The third came in the second round of match play during the PGA Championship. That was when Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase that summed up the entire year. With just four holes to play at Moraine Country Club in Dayton, Ohio, Turnesa was 2 up on Nelson. His shot to the 15th hole was 10 feet from the hole, and he barely missed his birdie attempt. Nelson, whose shot was inside Turnesa 's, made his putt. Nelson then squared the match with a birdie at 16, eagled the 17th to go 1 up and parred the last hole to protect his lead. <p> " I was seven under and still lost, " is what Turnesa said. " How the hell are you supposed to beat this man? " <p> Five decades later, Nelson leans back in his chair and chuckles at that. He recalls that two weeks later, at Tam O'Shanter, he shot 269 to beat Hogan and Gene Sarazen by 11 strokes for his 10th straight victory. <p> " I look back on it now, and it just seems like a good long dream, " he said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head for a period of a year and a half or so. But you know, the thing was, I consistently drove the ball in the fairway, and when you 're doing that, you 've got to be swinging well enough to put the ball on the green with your irons. " <p> Always in the fairway. That was part of it. He has not been out of it since. After the following season, he retired from golf, at the age of 34, because he had done everything he set out to do and he had made enough money to buy the ranch, 740 acres in the town about 15 miles outside Dallas. He and his first wife, Louise, who died in 1985, had always wanted a place like that. He named it " Fairway Ranch " and he still lives there. <p> Byron Nelson tells you that he has no regrets about golf, and you believe him, because everything about his demeanor tells you so. Sure, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the career Grand Slam, but in those days it just cost too much to make the trip and he would have had to take a month off from his club job. He only made the crossing twice. No regret. Sure, if he had stayed in the game longer he would have won a lot more tournaments, " but maybe then I would n't have gotten into television, would n't have had my name associated with my Byron Nelson Classic, you just never know. " No regrets. <p> The only thing Nelson will admit to regretting is associating his name with a cigarette company back in 1936. A devout man who to this day attends prayer meetings and church at the Hilltop Church of Christ, he never smoked, drank, chased women or stayed out late, something Snead still ribs him about. But he needed the money, and he took a $500 fee for endorsing a cigarette called 20 Grand. When the ads came out, the letters came in. <p> Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " None of us realizes how many people we influence, " he said, " and there had been a lot of nice articles written about me, about how I was a nice Christian man who did n't smoke or drink or do this or that, and suddenly this ad comes out and I started getting some of the most terrible letters from schoolteachers and Sunday school teachers. They said, ' Well, there you are, just like everybody else, letting the almighty dollar get to you. ' Five hundred dollars. I was sick about that. It was the worst thing I 've ever done. " <p> He tried to give the money back, but the company refused. He says now he prayed about it " many, many times, brought it to the good Lord and said I 'd never do anything again as long as I lived to influence people the wrong way. " <p> Money has never been that important to Nelson. " If I had made $10 million, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now, " he said. And he means it. It amuses him to think of how much money he would have made winning 18 tournaments last year -- it would have been somewhere in the $8 million range -- and he chuckles at the notion. <p> " I could not be happier than I am, " he said, and as he stands to put the photo on a nearby table, his major concession to age is evident. His walk is painfully slow, the result of hip-replacement surgery several years ago. He does n't get to play much golf anymore, but he will tell you, at the urging of his second wife, Peggy, whom he married in 1986, about the 83 he shot a few weeks ago. The only thing troubling Nelson these days is the illness of Hogan, who is in a Fort Worth hospital recovering from colon surgery. <p> Although the two men grew up together, caddied together, competed and traveled together and had many meals together, Nelson has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he knows that Hogan does n't want company, and he respects his wishes. It still seems to pain him, though. <p> " We are good friends and I understand the way he is, " Nelson said. " He has never been outgoing. I 've always respected his wishes about people leaving him alone. I 'm very concerned that he 's ill. " <p> Nelson moves slowly into the family room of the ranch, where many of his trophies and memorabilia are displayed. He ca n't move like he once did, but his eye-hand coordination is still there. He is using a Cleveland Classic copy of his old McGregor driver as a cane, and as he walks he spots an ant scurrying across the floor. He gets it with the butt of the club on his first try. <p> Less than a week from this day, on the eve of the tournament that bears his name, Byron Nelson would stand in the Ben Crenshaw Suite at the Four Seasons, announcing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open at the resort in September and admiring the new Byron Nelson Eleven Straight Tournament Trophy, a silver loving cup designed by Tiffany &; Co. He was worn out, but enormously proud. <p> " I feel like I 'm the luckiest man in golf, " he would say. " Not just because I have a few records attached to my name or anything like that. Just because of the way people have accepted me, wherever I 've gone, welcomed me. It has been a wonderful year, a wonderful year. " <p> That it has. All because of a wonderful year, 50 years ago, a year that framed a feat that will never be duplicated and one that even the jaded golf professionals of today and the legions of golf fans recognize as something cosmic, otherworldly. As the sun sets over Texas and the cool of the evening comes to the Dallas suburbs, a pair of tourists sit at the feet of the giant Byron Nelson statue near the first tee and pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he stops and turns to the copper image of Nelson. He salutes. It is a gesture that comes from generations of golfers, from all across time.
