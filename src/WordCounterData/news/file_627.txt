4136641 Memories of the night that forever changed the landscape of American soccer are, like the evening itself, all a blur. Landon Donovan was just 18 when he made his U.S. national team debut against Mexico at the Coliseum on Oct. 25, 2000, coming on as an unexpected substitute in the 32nd minute after veteran Chris Henderson went down because of a muscle cramp. By the end of the night the Redlands native had danced around Mexico goalkeeper Adrian Martinez for a goal and the Hollywood ending for the debut of a star who would make a career out of delivering them. " It was crazy, " Donovan recalled this week. " I remember not expecting to play and within minutes of( kickoff) Chris Henderson going down. Not even having time to think about going into the game. Obviously it was a dream come true in every way. It 's a game I 'll never forget. " It was just surreal to be there as a starting point. I did n't know any better and thankfully so I was just a kid, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on I just ran around and it all worked out. " Through the haze of time this much is clear : On that cool October night, Donovan not only announced himself the future of U.S. soccer, he guaranteed that the American game had a future. Donovan makes his 157th and final appearance for Team USA against Ecuador in East Hartford, Conn., on Friday night, a victory lap for the most gifted and transformative player in American soccer history. " He 's been the face of U.S. Soccer since he was a teenage kid and has been carrying that weight on his shoulders for the longest time now, " said U.S. and Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez. Donovan has not only been the face of the American game, he more than anyone was the player who erased the two biggest questions hounding U.S. Soccer the night he stepped onto the pitch against Mexico : Could Team USA compete at a global level and was Major League Soccer going to survive? " He was a player who pushed soccer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. forward Jozy Altidore said. Donovan came on to the scene at a time when the U.S. national team was still reeling from an embarrassing last-place finish at the 1998 World Cup and MLS was teetering, up to its shin guards in red ink, surviving solely because of the patience and generosity of AEG, and the Hunt and Kraft families. Less than two years after his October 2000 debut, Donovan had led the U.S. to the 2002 World Cup quarterfinals and had guided San Jose to the MLS Cup, the first of five MLS titles Donovan would be a part of. " He 'll go down as arguably the greatest American soccer player of all-time, " said Galaxy coach Bruce Arena, who coached Donovan on the U.S. national team from 2000 to ' 06. " Arguably had the greatest career to date in Major League Soccer. " Donovan was just as marketable off the pitch as he was successful on it, giving the U.S. men 's national team and MLS its first transcendent player, a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men 's game. " Let 's not give Landon all the credit for getting everybody involved in soccer in this country, but he has certainly had a great impact at the technical level on the field and the commercial level where he 's opened eyes and brought financial support to the game with sponsors and those types of things, " Arena said. " So he has a great legacy. " Friday 's celebration of that legacy comes with a significant subplot. There remains a distinct chill between Donovan and U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who cut Donovan from the World Cup roster last May in a controversial move that followed Team USA through the World Cup. Although Donovan is set to captain the U.S. on Friday night, he said he has not heard from Klinsmann since the World Cup snub and it 's clear the animosity between the pair has not diminished. Donovan said this weekend 's farewell was U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati 's idea. " I give Sunil a lot of credit for making the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. national team record holder for goals( 57), assists( 58), World Cup appearances( 12) and World Cup goals( five). " He made sure that this was something that this was going to happen and I 'm glad that he did. " I was very unsure at first, but he did a good job of making sure that everything would come together so that this could be possible. " Donovan was asked if he thought it was unlikely the event would happened without Gulati 's intervention. " I do n't know for sure but I would say that 's a safe assumption, " he said. While Donovan tries to avoid talk of hard feelings toward Klinsmann, he also downplays his role in transforming the American game and MLS. " I think a lot of us in this generation have and I think a lot in the generations before have, " Donovan said. " It 's a long process to make a sport popular. It 's not five years, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't always what it is today. The NBA was n't always what it is today. There are a lot of guys who paved the way to make it the way it is. So we 're doing our part. We sort of came in at a point where the sport was very much fluctuating, ' is it going to stay or not? ' So it was an interesting time to be a part of it and I think you get a lot of praise for that, but the reality is that without the work of the guys who went before we would n't have been there either. " Donovan 's most memorable moment in red, white and blue will always be his electrifying injury-time goal against Algeria that sent the U.S. into the 2010 World Cup 's Round of 16. But when asked to pick his best match for the U.S., he turned elsewhere. " I 'd probably pick two, " Donovan said. " One was the game against Germany in the World Cup in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring. And, two, I think was the ' 09( Confederations Cup) semifinal against Spain. I think that was probably the single best game I 've played from beginning to end in all ways. " Despite the disappointment of being denied the chance to play in a fourth World Cup, Donovan has not second-guessed his decision to return to the Galaxy for a final season. " I wanted to play another year, " he said. " I wanted to see how it went. I was in a good place mentally, physically and I was excited. Obviously the World Cup played into that. I wanted to be back here. This was a year I wanted to play for sure. " A year in which Donovan is playing some of the best soccer of his career, especially down the home stretch, producing four goals and 11 assists in the Galaxy 's past 11 matches. He insists he has n't been driven through the stretch run to prove Klinsmann wrong. " To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when asked how much the World Cup snub motivated him. " I know that 's probably hard to believe, but I 'm glad. In a lot of ways as crazy as this sounds some of the worst things that have happened in my life have turned out to be some of the best things. " I had an opportunity to grow a lot from what happened this year, and I would n't have had that opportunity had I gone to the World Cup and played in the World Cup. So I 've grown a lot from it and it 's probably shown in the way I 've played. " So what did he learn? " When life is easy and things go your way, you do n't learn a lot, " he said. " But you learn a lot when things do n't go your way, so for me it was a good learning experience. " The days and weeks leading up to Friday 's final match, the emails and calls from old teammates, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was spending this month 's rent on a plane ticket to Hartford, have provided him something else to hold on to, a beam of clarity through clouded memories and emotions. " I think sometimes, " he said, " when we get all wrapped up in this we forget how special it 's been along the way. " sreid@ocregister.com
