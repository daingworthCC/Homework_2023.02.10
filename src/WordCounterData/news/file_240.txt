3044741 <p> After a decade of putting up with a white galley kitchen with teal floors, Joyce Block finally got the room of her dreams. <p> Her new Buckhead kitchen gleams with a neutral serenity, from limestone counters and floors to stainless steel, professional-style appliances. And knocking out a wall between the breakfast room added more space for weekly gatherings with children and grandchildren. <p> The room is a restful, monochromatic space to entertain and relax. It 's pretty, and Block intends to keep it that way : She covers the porous limestone countertops with plastic when she does n't have visitors. <p> If that sounds a little like putting plastic covers on the new living room sofa, it 's not far off. Homeowners have embraced a new breed of " living room, " often equipped with whisper-quiet dishwashers, high-speed burners and flattering lighting. <p> Kitchens are where we entertain, surf the Internet, watch TV, eat and do homework. Sometimes we cook in them. Sometimes we just show off. <p> While we 're less likely to have such staples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens than we were 10 years ago and more likely to use frozen food and ready-made cookie dough, many people still hunger for pro-style cooktops that can simmer chocolate for hours without burning. <p> " This is going to sound crazy, " says Duncan Black, vice president of sales for Dacor appliances ' Southeast division, " but they go in to see these appliances and see the commercial range with the big griddle, the big burners, and they envision themselves being a great cook. A lot of it is visualization. They see themselves being a good cook, entertaining in a beautiful home. " <p> The faltering economy has n't kept a parade of luxury kitchen showrooms from opening in metro Atlanta, eager to tap into -- or create a hunger for -- the newest version of the American dream. <p> Designers and appliance dealers like to compare customers ' hunger for stylish kitchens to their choice of cars. <p> " Our homes project who we are and what we think about ourselves, " says Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store Poliform Atlanta. <p> It 's an apt comparison in another way, too : At least one brand of high-end stove comes with a catalytic converter, to burn away cooking odors. <p> The most expensive kitchens can cost $400,000 or more, with two of everything from islands to dishwashers. The cabinetry alone can cost $250,000, more than the average home in metro Atlanta. Smaller kitchens tucked into butler 's pantries may do most of the real work, so the showcase kitchen 's crystal chandeliers, porous countertops and furniture-grade cabinetry stay pristine. <p> " I wanted something that looked good, " Block says. " I wanted the appliances to work, but I 'm not really into that. The aesthetics were much more important to me. A stove is a stove. " <p> The average kitchen renovation costs $35,000 to $40,000, according to the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. That 's for a typical small midcentury kitchen of perhaps 150 square feet. <p> To get the kind of upscale kitchen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high-end shelter magazines -- one with granite countertops, new cabinets, an open floorplan and pro-style appliances -- the cost is closer to $100,000. As the little luxuries pile up, so do the costs : brass farmhouse sinks for $2,000, built-in coffeemakers for $1,800, warming drawers for $750 or more. <p> " Information is so accessible that everyone wants this particular brand of refrigerator, this brand of cooktop or oven, " says designer Jere Bowden of Jere Bowden and Associates. " You 've got a much larger percentage of the market who want higher-end. " <p> Because cabinetry and appliance styles change so rapidly, the life span of today 's kitchen may be as short as a decade and likely no longer than 20 years, designers say. The white kitchen that seemed such a safe bet in the early ' 90s is out. The popularity of granite countertops may be eroding their appeal in the most expensive kitchens. Upscale kitchens are increasingly likely to flaunt more fragile countertops of limestone or marble or granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy that builders must make sure floor joists will support the added weight. <p> " Not to be crass, but the upper echelon does n't want to have the same thing that everyone else on their street has, " says Matthew Quinn of Design Galleria Kitchen Studio. " Probably in a couple of years we 'll be taking three slabs and stacking them. " <p> Appliances are getting bigger, too. Dacor recently introduced a $2,500 dishwasher large enough to wash 20 place settings at once. It advertises a new 36-inch wall oven as large enough to cook two turkeys, an oversized casserole and a pie simultaneously. For larger kitchens, separate, built-in freezers and refrigerators are becoming standard equipment. <p> Alton Brown of " Good Eats " on the Food Network thinks that 's a bit much. Yet when the show switched locations from an all-white, builder-grade kitchen to one equipped with high-end appliances and soapstone countertops, viewers noticed. They thought it was pretty. <p> The show moved to get more room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message about what kind of kitchen viewers should aspire to. His metro Atlanta home has laminate countertops, upscale but not professional appliances and, he says, one luxury : a really big sink. <p> " I look at the kitchen as a playroom, not a living room, so status does n't count for me there, personally, " Brown says. " I just want things to work. " <p> A gathering place <p> Judi Parrett figures she got a bargain on her kitchen, even though it probably cost close to six figures. Her family moved from New Jersey to Alpharetta after getting an estimate of $750,000 to expand their home, including adding a new kitchen, to accommodate a growing family of three children. After doing some checking, they decided to relocate their wholesale fabric business and roll the money from selling their small New Jersey house into a sprawling home in a golf course subdivision. <p> Parrett preferred to grill outside in New Jersey, even on snowy days, rather than cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the smoke detector. In Alpharetta, her spacious kitchen includes a bar where the children can eat and do homework, a warming drawer that keeps meals waiting for a son with late football practices and a vaulted ceiling that 's open to a second-floor kids ' family room. A SubZero freezer, discreetly concealed behind cream-colored wood doors, is packed with steaks, free-range chicken, swordfish and homemade chicken broth. Double ovens mean no more juggling. Four sets of French doors let light pour in. <p> " I wanted a place that was open and airy, where people would be comfortable, " she says. " It 's very important to me. It 's a big social area for us. " <p> Still, Parrett says she set some limits. She drew the line at more than one dishwasher. She chose ceramic tile rather than natural stone for the floor. Carrying memories of friends crowded into her old, tiny kitchen, she did insist on a large space. <p> " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to dinner here, Judi, ' " Parrett says. <p> Not the Parretts, who most nights cook at home. The kitchen has become what she envisioned, a gathering place for family and friends. <p> As kitchens have become a primary entertainment area in the home, they 're gobbling up a larger amount of space. The reason : That 's where we spend most of our time. <p> " It seems like at all family gatherings, parties too, everybody ends up inside the kitchen, " says Nancy Hackney, who recently renovated a dark, ' 80s-style kitchen in her central DeKalb home. " It 's really one of the friendliest rooms of the house. " <p> In 2001, the average new home was more than 50 percent larger than its counterpart of three decades before. With the number of bedrooms staying about the same, much of the extra space is going to kitchens, foyers and bathrooms, says Gopal Ahluwalia of the National Association of Home Builders. <p> In upscale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen is slightly larger than a two-car garage, more than twice the size of a kitchen in the average home. High-end homes may have morning kitchens in master suites, with coffeemakers, refrigerators and microwaves, as well as outdoor kitchens with grills, refrigerators and icemakers. <p> In metro Atlanta, there 's no shortage of places to dream. New showrooms keep coming, from Whirlpool/KitchenAid 's Insperience in Buckhead to the Viking Culinary Arts Center in Brookwood to the sprawling Wolf Culinary Center in a Duluth industrial park. <p> Retailers that target consumers with more moderate incomes are selling pieces of the dream, too. Wal-Mart stocks stainless steel appliances, Sears markets Bosch dishwashers, Home Depot displays granite slabs in its parking lots, and Expo Design Center recently added laminate countertops in granite, concrete and limestone patterns. <p> Appliance showrooms such as Viking, Insperience and Hadco in Suwanee practice a marketing strategy that other retailers are studying : creating excitement for a product by giving customers a hands-on experience with it, then sending them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's the chance to simmer stock and make pasta -- a combined cooking class and product demonstration designed to leave students hungering for similar gear at home. Potential buyers are referred to retailers. <p> At Wolf, which opened in June, customers can stroll through kitchen vignettes from some of the city 's top designers, take classes and cook on pro-style appliances. The ladies ' bathroom glitters with crystal chandeliers and $2,000 faucets. The lobby floors are marble and granite. One model kitchen has cork flooring. Another has lava countertops with a glazed, crackled top that looks like crazed earthenware and sells for $300 a square foot. <p> " We 're selling not just an appliance, but a lifestyle, " says Rob Maxam, vice president of sales for the Georgia division of the Westye Group, which distributes Wolf, Sub-Zero and other high-end appliances. <p> Maxam pegs his market at homes costing $700,000 or more. But dedicated cooks in more modest quarters may be persuaded to buy as well. Even those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to equip a kitchen with pro-style appliances. <p> " It 's not truly all show and no use, " says Harry Balzer, who studies eating trends as a vice president for the market research firm NPD Group. " Sixty-five percent of all suppers eaten yesterday were still prepared inside the home. " <p> Julie Langhorne, who 's lived through two kitchen renovations in different homes, says having the right equipment and surroundings helps her cook more often. She picked her east Cobb home partly for its outdated kitchen, one that she knew there would be no question of keeping. The white tile countertops had cracked as the house settled. The cabinets were white, most appliances black, the refrigerator almond. One oven did n't work, and pots slid around on the uneven cooktop. <p> Now it 's state-of-the-art, in earth tones with granite countertops, light maple cabinets, two sinks, pro-style appliances and an open flow to the family room. <p> " I got to do it the way I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and says the extra room to store fresh vegetables and meats means she 's cooking more healthfully. Langhorne can set the oven timer to have dinner ready after her son 's baseball practice, instead of stopping at a fast-food restaurant as they once did. <p> " It looks better, " Langhorne says. " You do n't mind having people over because you 're proud of it. It 's also much more functional.
