3047141 <p> Chronicle outdoors writer Glen Martin is kayaking the length of the Sacramento River, reporting firsthand on the state of the main artery in Northern California 's troubled water system. <p> There is a bathtub ring on the river banks just south of Sacramento, the first visible sign of the rise and fall of the tides. This is the beginning of the Sacramento River 's delta, a vast area of sloughs and canals where the commingling of fresh and salt water occurs, creating the brackish conditions necessary for exceptionally rich fisheries. <p> Until the late 19th century, the delta was a huge expanse of marsh and grassland. Its waters supported shrimp, starry flounder and sturgeon in unfathomed numbers. The tules sheltered millions of ducks and provided forage for hundreds of thousands of tule elk and pronghorn antelope. <p> The delta remained biologically rich even when canals and levees were built in the early part of this century. Striped bass, introduced from the East Coast in the 1890s, flourished here, and native fish and waterfowl continued to thrive. <p> " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California Striped Bass Association, a group dedicated to enhancing delta water quality and fisheries. " The water was clear and green, and fish were everywhere. All the levees were forested, and they were full of game and songbirds. " <p> But things are different now, says Sorensen, who has fished the delta since 1941. These days, the numbers of striped bass and sturgeon are at historic lows. And as I paddle south from Walnut Grove, I find few trees along the levees. Belted kingfishers and green herons are thick in the few stands of willows and cottonwoods that do remain, proof that the birds will come back if they are granted the few bare essentials they require. <p> The water is remarkably dirty. When I arrive at the confluence of the river and Steamboat Slough, just north of the Rio Vista Bridge, I pass a Vietnamese family standing up to their chests in the gray-green water, digging for the small, black clams that abound in the mud. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Southeast Asians, and I feel a pang of concern. Clams are filter feeders, and they pick up viruses, heavy metals and chemical contaminants from their environment. I certainly would never eat any clams harvested from this locale, but I do n't feel comfortable advising others on their diet, so I paddle on. <p> Few people know the long, sad history of the delta 's decline better than Sorensen, whom I meet at Rio Vista. We get into his battered truck and careen over levee roads to Tracy, where he says the roots of the delta 's problems lie. It is here that both the state and federal governments maintain gigantic pumping stations that suck water from the delta and send it to the farmlands and municipalities of Southern California. <p> " It 's very basic -- the pumps are killing the delta, " says Sorensen, a bluff, bearded man in his late 50s, who reels off an unending stream of anecdotes and statistics on fish mortality. " The pumps suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catfish. Most of them are destroyed, but enough get through to the aqueducts so that they reproduce there. " <p> He points out that the California Aqueduct, the 440-mile-long concrete canal that carries water from the delta to the southern part of the state, has more mature striped bass in it than the entire delta. <p> Sorensen cites a recent incident in which a 1,200-foot section of the aqueduct was closed to repair a leak in the concrete lining. Members of Sorensen 's organization and the California Department of Fish and Game were called on to seine the drained area so the stranded fish could be transported back to the delta. <p> " Out of that one small stretch, we netted 1,200 catfish... five to 18 pounds and 185 stripers up to 47 pounds. Now, if you extrapolate that out to the entire 400 miles of the aqueduct, you 're talking over 300,000 mature bass. If we have 200,000 mature stripers in the delta, we 're lucky. " <p> So why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I refuse to support a fishery that exists in a concrete-lined aqueduct, " Sorensen snorts. " It 's a vampire ditch. That 's no compensation at all for the loss of the greatest estuary on the West Coast. " <p> The state-run Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant at Tracy is the largest on the delta. Seven huge pumps are housed at the station, and four more will be added soon. When the seven pumps are operating, they move about 12,000 acre-feet of water a day. An acre-foot of water equals 326,000 gallons. <p> In a typical year, 2.5 million acre-feet of water are pumped from the delta to the California Aqueduct. <p> I had been told by a commercial salmon fisherman to hold my nose when I walked into the building that houses the battery of pumps. " It stunk like rotten fish, " he said of the atmosphere during his visit. " It was the smell of the river 's life being sucked right out of it. " <p> I notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the pumps have been shut off since April in order to safeguard the Sacramento River 's endangered winter-run salmon. <p> The state 's water contracts with Southern California cotton growers and cities are being met by drawing down San Luis Reservoir, south of Tracy. <p> Our guide, state Department of Water Resources plant supervisor Marvin Niemi, says that when the four new pumps are operating, up to 4.5 million acre-feet of water will be shipped south from the delta annually. <p> Sorensen notes that this figure represents about 105 percent of the Sacramento River 's current downstream flow. In other words, he says, the state Department of Water Resources intends to pump more fresh water south than currently exists in the delta. <p> Niemi responds that the department is committed to protecting salmon and striped bass, and he points out the fish-screening apparatus that shield the pumps and the department 's willingness to alter pumping schedules to accommodate spawning fish. <p> " We 've changed the way we pump water, " says Niemi. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer, when the outmigrating young fish are most vulnerable. We hope to restrict pumping to high-flow incidents during the winter and store the water in our reservoir systems for later export. Essentially, we 'll just be pumping excess water. " <p> Yet such " high-flow " pumping by no means guarantees fish protection. Earlier this year, the Department of Water Resources began pumping during high-water flows February 16 and continued through the end of March. A state Department of Fish and Game internal memo dated April 3 estimated that the pumping may have destroyed 32,000 young winter-run salmon, or about 63 percent of the year 's total. <p> " And it 's not just the mechanical destruction of the fish, " says Sorensen as we drive back to Rio Vista. " It 's the export of the water itself. There is no ' excess ' delta water. We need truly brackish conditions for a healthy delta, the mixing of fresh and salt water. Now, the delta 's so salty that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Those are strictly marine species. " <p> On the way back to the river, Sorensen drives me through Discovery Bay, a huge residential development right in the heart of the delta. High-priced homes by the hundreds stand arrayed along a serpentine network of canals, and scores of expensive yachts are docked at a posh marina. <p> The homes are well-maintained, and the residents we meet seem happy. But the scene fills Sorensen with trepidation. <p> " People do have to live somewhere, " he says. " But the delta is one of our greatest natural treasures.... If we allow development like this to continue, if we do n't do anything to reform water deliveries, it 'll all be gone and we 'll never get it back. " <p> He shakes his head. " We can still save it -- we just do n't have very much time to do it.
