3049841 <p> POLICE CRIME LABS NEED PROPOSITION 15 <p> Editor -- The February 9 article, " Crime Lab Money on Primary Ballot, " accurately recounts that DNA testing and other forensic methods are critical in solving crimes. However, developments in forensic science have not been paralleled by advancements in the infrastructure of crime laboratories. Many labs are severely underfunded and overcrowded. <p> While the SFPD Crime Lab has moved to a much-improved facility, my staff struggles daily to prioritize scores of homicide and sexual assault cases by " waiting in line " to use existing equipment. Additional equipment and other facility improvements would greatly enhance the service we provide to the citizens of San Francisco. <p> Solutions for the needs of local crime labs desperately need to be implemented. Proposition 15 will help by providing upgrades and promoting public confidence in the work product of crime labs. <p> Crime is an issue for all Californians, and it is everyone 's responsibility to ensure we have the most up-to-date tools to fight crime. The passage of Proposition 15 will propel us in a direction of increased public safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MARTHA BLAKE <p> Crime Laboratory manager <p> San Francisco Police Department <p> BUSH 'S MISSTEPS <p> Editor -- I am a good Republican. And as a good Republican it does not bother me that George W. Bush probably does n't know how to spell " banana. " <p> What bothers me is that he keeps stepping on the peelings. <p> ED WALKER <p> Walnut Creek <p> NO TEARS FOR WESTLANDS <p> Editor -- The February 10 Chronicle carries a letter written by David Orth, general manager of the Westlands Water District, whining about the damages allegedly being visited on the state 's " heartland " as a result of the reallocation of water by the federal Central Valley Project to environmental protection. <p> What are the real facts? Westlands 35 years ago was a desert with almost no historic water rights. Then it got access to huge supplies of water provided, nearly gratis and at great environmental cost, by the federal government. Recent decisions by Congress, and by federal and state administrations of both parties, have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total consumptive water use( or about one-fifth of the Central Valley Project 's water supply) to the natural environment. Westlands ' reliable supply of taxpayer-subsidized water has shrunk commensurately. Despite this loss, agribusiness on the west side has boomed as its water use has become much more efficient and it has purchased replacement water on the open market. <p> Do n't cry for Mr. Orth and most of his constituents. They are doing fine, hiring the best lawyers, lobbyists and publicity agents to make their case. Worry instead about the stability of water supplies for fish and wildlife, who do n't give campaign contributions and whose recent rebound may not survive the next inevitable drought. <p> THOMAS J. GRAFF <p> Senior Attorney <p> Environmental Defense <p> Oakland <p> SAVE THE KELP FORESTS <p> Editor -- California 's kelp forests are the foundation of the most biodiverse and productive of all temperate water ecosystems, providing shelter and food for literally hundreds of species, including the feder ally threatened California sea otter. The Monterey Bay National Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mateo County 's kelp beds. <p> The sanctuary has the right to manage kelp forests, but California Department of Fish and Game( DFG) is still in control. DFG currently licenses several small abalone culture operations, which harvest 600 tons per year. Four larger farms are currently approved for Half Moon Bay. The Kelco Corp. takes 12,000 tons statewide, primarily for cosmetics. DFG refuses to release the exact tonnage taken within the " sanctuary. " <p> It is difficult to have informed public comment when such basic information is withheld, and more so when the bureaucrats are on a first-name basis with kelp harvesters and are actively hostile to conservationists. <p> A public forum on the second draft of the plan is scheduled in Half Moon Bay. If you are one of the tens of thousands of surfers, divers, kayakers, fishers and other ocean users who live in the Bay Area and use kelp forests, make your voice heard. <p> Call the sanctuary office( at( 831) 647-4257 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kelp forests of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary belong to all of the people of California. They are worth far more alive than $1.71 per ton dead. Attend public hearings where you live. <p> JAMES THOMPSON <p> Pacific Grove <p> BREAST CANCER JOURNEY <p> Editor -- I applaud the efforts of Andrea Martin of the Breast Cancer Fund to hold the attention of women regarding breast cancer with the recent advertisements removed by the male executives of San Francisco 's transit system. <p> My breast cancer was found 13 years ago by a mammogram. Early detection gave me options. I became an informed patient by subscribing to Breast Cancer Action 's newsletter( call toll free 877-2STOPBC). Being an informed patient gave me more clarity on treatment options when I had a recurrence seven years ago. <p> During my 13-year journey with breast cancer, I have seen too many of my friends die of breast cancer, and many others, including myself, try to make sense of living with the disease. <p> I deplore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing discussion in various related articles in The Chronicle. <p> How patronizing that media censors feel they must protect us from images of women living with breast cancer, but are willing to constantly bombard us with images of the ravages of war, drugs and violence. <p> JENNIFER ADSHEAD MacLEOD <p> Carmel <p> REAL ESTATE DIALOGUE <p> Editor -- As a San Francisco residential property manager, I interact with both property owners and apartment renters. As an individual who respects the issues that both sides represent, I find the comments of Randy Shaw to be of interest.( Letters, February 10). <p> He assumes conflict between " long-term senior and disabled tenants, " and the effects of their " health, financial status and psychological well-being, " against " landlords ' personal income, " the premise of upgrading property at renters ' expense, profit made by real estate agents who evict tenants to convert the property, and to what extent the city 's homeless crisis is caused by skyrocketing rents. <p> Where is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate investment are : increasing the housing stock ; improving the neighborhoods ; increasing the tax base that serves all ; and that all-American goal of some profit to feed the family? Where is the discussion that involves whose responsibility it is to solve these obvious problems of housing shortages, the problems of seniors who suddenly find it impossible to financially keep up, or of the homeless? Is it the property owner only? Or is it the rest of us, called " society? " <p> A pragmatic approach by Mr. Shaw that involved two-way dialogues of all those involved would result in answers and progress. The dogmatic approach that Mr. Shaw is using is resulting in animosity and rancor, a splitting of the parties, no answers, and certainly no progress. <p> BILL SORENSEN <p> San Francisco <p> BROADSIDED <p> Editor -- I would like to add my comments to the debate regarding pedestrians and automobiles and improving safety on San Francisco streets. In recent months I have frequently observed complete disregard for traffic laws as people rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistic. <p> On January 22, my car was broadsided and totaled while I was driving toward Golden Gate Park across an intersection with four-way lights. Very fortunately, two of my grandchildren, who were in the back seat, were not injured. The driver of the car that ran into us told the police that her light was green when she entered the intersection. However, a pedestrian witness to the accident informed police that this was untrue -- the driver had gone through a red light. The subsequent police report indicates that the driver who broadsided me violated V.C. Section 21453A and no citation was issued. I asked my insurance agent about the lack of a citation and was told that it is fairly common in such cases. <p> It is very hard for me to understand why there was no penalty for such wanton destruction of property and endangerment of others. Appropriate penalties, such as a driver 's license suspension for not obeying traffic laws, might make the streets safer for all. <p> CORNELA CALHOUN @ @ @
