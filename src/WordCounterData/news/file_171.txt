3033641 <p> Unprecedented cold weather across the eastern half of the United States plunged the Washington area yesterday into its biggest power emergency in nearly two decades, shutting down federal and local government offices, schools and businesses after utilities made an extraordinary public plea for them to close. <p> Most governments shut down at 3 p.m., three hours after an urgent appeal from Potomac Electric Power Co. that warned of catastrophic consequences if demands for electricity were n't curtailed. Washington Gas Co., which provides natural gas for the area, and other regional power companies, including Baltimore Gas &; Electric Co., issued similar appeals. <p> Federal offices -- as well as Congress -- and many of the area 's local governments, universities, schools and businesses were scheduled to remain shut today, when as much as two inches of snow is predicted to fall. <p> Last night, D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly declared a state of emergency for today in the District, requiring all " nonessential businesses " to close and " nonessential personnel " to stay home from work. <p> The shutdown appeal came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small segments of electrical customers in rotation( rolling blackouts) and other pleas for conservation failed to reduce power demand sufficiently. <p> The ice, snow and cold left many people housebound for a third day, unsure when they would be able to get back to work, when they would be able to get to a grocery store, when they could turn up the heat, when the children could go back to school and when they would get mail again. <p> Adding to the crisis was a high temperature yesterday of only 8 degrees at National Airport, the lowest high temperature in Washington this century. National 's low, minus 4, was a record for the date. <p> The forecast called for a low this morning that would be at or below zero, with a high today in the high teens. <p> In the District, restaurants, including fast-food establishments, were included among nonessential services and should close, said Zachary D. Smith, spokesman for the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The only exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the emergency order exempted hospitals and medical service providers, including dentists and doctors in private practice, police and firefighters, utility workers, grocery and convenience stores, news organizations, public transportation, taxicabs, hotels, pharmacies, hardware stores, electricians and plumbers, Smith said. <p> There were no firm estimates on how much the area-wide closures would cost companies that had experienced staffing problems for days and businesses that already were reeling from reduced sales. Local governments are just beginning to tote up their bills for road cleaning and water main breaks and the cost of adding extra school days. <p> The power emergency was precipitated by unexpectedly low temperatures producing record demand for electricity at the same time weather-related problems reduced electrical generating capacity for many utilities, prompting the first-ever appeal for a total government shutdown across the area. <p> " This is one of the last emergency procedures to keep electricity accessible to people, " said Nancy Moses, a Pepco spokeswoman. " This is one of the last things we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of customers for longer periods of time. " <p> Moses said that if demand could not be reduced, the Washington area was in danger of contributing to what would be a massive power failure along the Eastern Seaboard, such as the one that blacked out the New York area in November 1965. <p> The utilities ' urgent appeals brought widespread reductions, from hospitals that turned off corridor lights and copying machines to Metrorail, which announced it would reduce service today to a modified Saturday schedule and would cut back even further if low ridership indicated that was possible. <p> The lights were even dimmed, but not shut off, at the national monuments. <p> Pepco and other area utilities, including Virginia Power and BG &E,; asked customers to turn down their thermostats to 60 degrees and to postpone using appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers during peak morning and evening hours. <p> Adding to the misery for some area residents were difficulties in delivering natural gas, especially to some areas of Prince George 's County. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Co. cut off gas to 3,000 commercial and residential customers near Route 301 because of low pressure in a pipeline there. <p> By 4 p.m. yesterday, a taped appeal by Prince George 's County Executive Parris N. Glendening asking people to conserve electricity and natural gas was broadcast on the regional Emergency Broadcasting System on WTOP-AM and WMAL-AM. <p> WTOP editor Judy Taub said the station activated the emergency system after Prince George 's County officials called in and gave station officials the correct code to activate the system in the Washington area. <p> The station then sounded the tones of the emergency system and a broadcaster introduced Glendening, who then delivered his message live, Taub said. <p> The magnitude of the emergency caught utilities, governments, businesses and, most of all, residents by surprise. They went to sleep Tuesday night worrying about whether the roads would be passable yesterday morning and awoke with alarm to new questions about how they would cope with cold homes, few electricity-fed diversions and the looming possibility of frozen pipes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been much worse than it had expected, setting all-time low temperature records across much of the Midwest and in the Appalachians. Temperatures in the Washington area dropped nearly 10 degrees lower than forecast. <p> The mercury did n't rise above zero at National Airport until 11 a.m. <p> The winds calmed during the day, but overcast skies today -- bearing snow -- will keep the air from getting very warm. High temperatures tomorrow may climb into the twenties under sunny skies. Saturday 's high should be in the high thirties. <p> Pepco 's Moses said the cold temperatures Tuesday night meant that the lessening of demands for electricity that usually occurs after most people in the area get home from work and finish their dinners never happened. There was essentially no drop in what had been record demand Tuesday evening. <p> By midday yesterday, the urgent public appeals had trimmed power demands to levels that allowed the blackouts to stop, but the utility planned to use them again last night and again today, if needed. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Moses said. <p> As Pepco -- which provides most of the electrical power in the District and the suburban Maryland areas close to the District -- was struggling to trim demand, other regional power companies were doing likewise. Virginia Power instituted rolling blackouts, as did BG &E.; <p> Federal government officials, faced with a shutdown of a steam plant that provides heat to four federal office buildings downtown, already had sent many of those workers home by mid-morning. But they were surprised to learn that Pepco had issued a public appeal for a full government shutdown. <p> After a hastily called meeting, federal officials closed government offices for all but " essential personnel " at 3:01 p.m. and said they would remain closed today. <p> In the District, the mayor can declare a state of emergency for the " immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety or welfare, " according to a section of the District Code covering health and safety, the corporation counsel 's office said last night. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are necessary affecting the conduct of businesses in the District, for example, " said Anna Blackburne, a special counsel to the corporation counsel. <p> The mayor also can impose a fine of as much as $ 1,000 on businesses or residents who fail to comply with the state of emergency, Blackburne said. <p> James B. King, director of the Office of Personnel Management and the person who makes the decision on when the federal government shuts down, said he, the Council of Governments and local jurisdictions will hold a conference call this afternoon to determine if weather conditions permit reopening offices tomorrow. <p> Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer ordered his state 's offices closed at 3 p.m. yesterday. State offices in Montgomery, Prince George 's, St. Mary 's, Carroll and Calvert counties are closed today, as are most schools and local government offices. <p> Virginia Gov. George Allen opted to keep open state offices but advised workers to dress warmly because the thermostats were being turned down to 60 degrees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest inconvenience was water pipe breaks. Richard Hebert, a Department of Public Works spokesman for the District, said the department has gotten about 700 calls about frozen or broken pipes since Monday. <p> One of those calls came from Scott Miller, of Capitol Hill, who heard a pipe break at 3 p.m. and spent the rest of the day bailing water out of his bathroom. <p> Hebert was sympathetic to Miller 's plight but said that as the department 's first priority, crews were working round the clock to fix more than 20 water main breaks in the city 's 1,287 miles of water pipes. The city has had no major water main break since one at 11th and R streets NW on Christmas night. <p> " We ca n't respond to all of these calls, " Hebert said. " We will provide consultation for pipes in private homes, but this is an extra service, " he said. <p> Miller, who has lived in the apartment for 10 years, could n't find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still bailing at 8 last night, but he was philosophical. " Looking at the California earthquake and its after-effects, things could be a lot worse, " he said. <p> Staff writers Peter Baker, Stephen Barr, Steve Bates, Dan Beyers, Ruben Castaneda, Paul Duggan, Hamil R.
