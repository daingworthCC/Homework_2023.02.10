3001141 <p> Even if Mayor David N. Dinkins can reassure investors that New York City 's finances are well managed, the city will probably pay sharply higher interest costs the next time it tries to raise money in the bond market, financial experts say. <p> Mr. Dinkins will face an important test on Thursday, they say, when the administration is to release a revised financial plan, showing how it will begin to grapple with a worsening economy and growing budget deficits. <p> In the unlikely event that the city 's financial monitors and the credit rating agencies find the plan inadequate, the city could have trouble selling the $950 million in bonds that it plans to issue next month, bond traders and analysts say. <p> But even if Mr. Dinkins passes this test -- and he has already taken a series of increasingly harsh steps in the last few days to reassure the financial community -- the traders and analysts say the city 's credibility with investors remains damaged from an earlier period of confusing signals and commitments. ' There Is Skepticism ' <p> " I think the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a bond broker and president of Titus &; Donnelly. " It is a matter of what they are going to have to pay. " <p> One underwriter of city bond issues, who asked not to be identified, observed, " There is skepticism about the city 's sincerity, its ability to deal with the budget gaps in a fiscally responsible way. " <p> Already the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, is forecasting that a $1.3 billion short-term note sale later this month will cost the city $7 million more than previously planned this year, because of rising interest costs. <p> The city could be forced to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest costs on its next sale of long-term bonds, even after taking into account overall changes in interest rates, analysts said. <p> City officials say they are aware of the concerns of investors and planning an extended information campaign to convince them that the city is capable of managing its affairs even in the face of an economic downturn. <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the markets at a reasonable price, " Ms. Holtzman said. " The fact that the administration knows it will have to run that gantlet is an important discipline. " Bond Sale Postponed <p> The city 's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said the administration was focusing on those concerns as it made a major effort to prepare what is usually a routine revision of its financial plan. <p> Because of concern over the next bond sale, Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman agreed to postpone it by a month, until December, to give them more time to reach out to investors. <p> The city is planning to go ahead with a sale of $1.3 billion in short-term notes later this month. But rather than holding an auction, as it has in the last few years, it will negotiate the interest rate with the city 's underwriters. <p> Aides to Miss Holtzman said the city 's strategy was governed by the concern that it had a complicated story to tell investors. Since-tax exempt notes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story is easier to convey. Unsettled Municipal Bond Market <p> Similarly, they said, when a note is a known commodity, auctions often produce lower interest costs. But when sales are large or complicated, or the market is in flux, negotiations may allow the city to sell bonds paying slightly less interest. City officials are hoping that with few other note sales scheduled this month, the notes will do well -- and thus ease the way for the bond sale next month. <p> One backdrop to the city 's worsening credit picture is an unsettled municipal bond market, in which investors are forsaking riskier investments in cities with problems in favor of safer, higher-rated issues. This has driven up interest costs for cities with problems. <p> Another is New York City 's special place in the bond market. It is the largest borrower in the municipal bond market, it is home to much of the municipal bond industry and its brush with bankruptcy in the 1970 's was one of the seminal events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> During one confusing week in early October -- in which Mr. Dinkins agreed to a 5.5 percent salary increase for teachers, announced a plan to hire thousands of police officers and warned that 15,000 city workers might have to be laid off -- the price of New York City bonds fell sharply, and the yields rose. Cut in Rating Is Possible <p> The administration 's confusing signals confounded the bond market. They came two weeks after the city completed its most successful bond sale, in which the city had to pay the lowest interest rates since Mr. Dinkins took office. Bear Stearns, the lead underwriter, either lost money or narrowly broke even on the deal. Underwriters, usually a group of investment banks, agree before a bond sale to buy the whole issue and then try to resell it at a profit. <p> After the bond prices fell, Standard &; Poor 's put the city 's $13 billion of outstanding bonds on its Credit Watch list, and warned that if the city did not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rating drop from A to BBB -- the lowest that is still called " investment grade " by the rating services, just above what would be, in effect, " junk bonds. " <p> In the next few weeks, as the administration rushed to reassure the financial community by cutting spending, warning of as many as 35,000 layoffs and pressuring unions for lower wage settlements, bond prices stopped falling. But they remained close to the high levels of early October. Lower Return <p> On Friday, long-term city bonds were yielding a return of about 8.6 percent, after going as high as 8.8 percent in some transactions, traders said. Traders said New York City bonds were already trading as if they had a BBB rating or lower. In early October, they were selling to yield 8.25 percent. A bond 's yield is what the investor who buys it gets on it. This can be more or less than the interest paid by the borrower. If the yield is higher, the buyer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bond. If the yield is lower, the buyer will pay more than the face value of the bond. <p> One way of measuring the city 's declining credit is to compare the difference between the yields on New York City bonds and the yields on other municipal bonds today and when the city last sold bonds, on Sept. 14. <p> In September, the city sold 21-year bonds with a yield of 8.05 percent, while other similar A-rated municipal bonds were yielding 7.65 percent, according to the Delphis Hanover Corporation. Sensitive to the City <p> Today, New York City bonds are trading at a yield of 8.6 percent, while similar bonds are trading to yield 7.5 percent. So by this standard the city 's interest costs increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent. <p> That translates into $7,000 in extra interest costs each year for each $1 million in bonds sold. Assuming the city paid the same extra interest for an entire year 's borrowing of about $4 billion, and all the bonds matured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra interest costs. City bonds have varying terms ranging up to 30 years. <p> Since many bond traders and investors live or at least work in New York City, they are especially sensitive to the political and social currents in the city, from homelessness to dirty streets and from fear of crime to City Hall skirmishes. <p> " The markets like predictability and routine, " said Alan J. Proctor, executive director of the state Financial Control Board. " The environment of the last month was unpredictability. The administration is now making extraordinary efforts to show that it is going about a predictable process. " ' Very Blunt Instrument ' <p> He said the " difference between the first week of October and now is like the difference between night and day. " <p> But Kurt van Kuller, managing director for research at Lebenthal &; Company, said that even if the city takes strong action and keeps its A bond rating from Standard &; Poor 's, the bond market might not react for a long time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Mr. van Kuller said. " The way it moves is in big swings. I do n't think that one bit of news will make a difference. " <p> And even if the Mayor calms concerns about the city 's management, Mr. van Kuller noted that other problems remain. " The issue will focus not so much on what is he doing next year, " he said, " but on the general problem of resources and the city 's economy. "
