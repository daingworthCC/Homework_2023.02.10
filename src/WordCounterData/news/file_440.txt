4022041 When is Opening Day, anyway? I would like to know. Was it Tuesday night in Tokyo, which happened to be Tuesday morning in Boston and earlier Tuesday morning in Oakland? Does it come next Monday at Wrigley Field and 13 other stadiums, where each host ballclub will call it Opening Day on actual American soil? Or is Opening Day really the day before in Washington, where the game starts in the evening, making it Opening Night? // Naturally, Bud Selig ca n't answer that question, just as he never explained why he turned his foggy head the other way on steroids. Selig forever will be known as The Greedy Commissioner, the car salesman who sells out integrity and tradition for fat-cat owners who are n't satisfied enough with $6 billion-plus in 2007 revenues and want to sell some T-shirts in Japan. All I know is, if baseball still wants to be embraced as the national pastime and still wants us to regard Opening Day as sacred, the season can not open halfway around the world. // DO N'T GIVE AWAY WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, not to be rented out any more than the Brits would allow the Premier League to launch in East Rutherford, N.J. Opening Day always has been a vital part of our sports romance, the raising of an emotional curtain between winter and spring, especially in places like Chicago where the winters are endless hell. There still was snow on the ground in this town when the defending champion Red Sox -- on a two-run double in the 10th inning by Manny Ramirez, who did n't take long to be Manny when he paused and admired a shot he thought was a home run -- overcame a ninth-inning deficit for a 6-5 win over the Athletics. // The game was terrific. Too bad the vast majority of Americans did n't see it -- in part because of technical problems at DirecTV that knocked out ESPN2 and a New England cable network that carries Red Sox games, but mostly because it was too damned early in the morning and too damned early on our biological baseball clocks. How can two games on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's played again early today -- start several days before the rest of the schedule, with all the other teams still playing exhibitions in Arizona and Florida? And if that is n't convoluted, consider that both teams will return to the U.S. and play more EXHIBITION games this weekend, meaning baseball will have established one of the goofiest precedents ever. // All so Selig can globalize a game that already is globalized and add a notch on his resume that is n't performance-enhanced. I have no problem, by the way, with playing games overseas, as the Dodgers and Padres did in China earlier this month. The difference : Those were exhibitions, not Opening Day. The NFL played a real game in London last season, but never, ever would those owners launch a season anywhere but in an American stadium. Not to sound like a xenophobe, but Opening Day should not be 13 time zones away from one team 's town and 16 from the other 's. It 's just un-American. // AND BUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud, raving about his international success and not caring too much about the folks back home. ' Not only do you feel that you 're watching history in the making, but we 're doing what we really set out to do, ' Selig said Tuesday. ' The game has never been more popular than it is in the United States today. Our goal is to take that popularity and make it worldwide. ' // So overwhelmed is Selig, he 's thinking about Opening Day-o-rama on other continents. ' I definitely want to go to Europe, ' he said, unaware that Euros view baseball as a bastardized version of cricket. ' We 'll go other places. We need to really step up the pace in Asia, and we 'll be back. This is a really remarkable market, and they are enjoying this so much. ' // Gee, why stop at Asia and Europe, Bud. Think of the possibilities in Antarctica. // Once a salesman, always a salesman, Selig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him, not because of him. On his watch, the sport recovered from a crippling labor impasse in 1994 thanks only to the power surge later in the decade. That was enabled, of course, by The Steroids Era, which Selig and the owners allowed to flourish in all its stench thanks to their refusal to nip a problem in the Bud -- twist intended -- even when they were well aware of the syringes and juice. With some major-leaguers still using human growth hormone as we speak, Selig still would prefer we not discuss performance-enhancing drugs anymore. He just wants to remind us about the game 's rebirth in recent years, ignoring the sleaze behind the rebirth. // ' The sport is more popular today than it 's ever been, ' Selig said. ' We 're at numbers today that none of us could have dreamed a decade ago. We 're going to draw this year between 80 million and 81 million people. Our gross revenues this year will be $6.5 billion. The interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all well and good. But the lords of the game ca n't market baseball as Americana, then make us get up at 5 a.m. for a hot dog and beer so they can celebrate the opener in Tokyo. Did anyone think of the diehards in Boston, who could n't even order a beer before 8 a.m. according to Massachusetts law? It 's hard enough finding anyone who still roots for the A 's, so how do you cultivate an Opening Day-type buzz by making Bay Area fans get up at 3 a.m.? // IT SEEMS A BIT CRAZY // I was on the Tokyo trip in 2000 when the Cubs opened against the Mets. I remember an exhibition in the suburbs ending in a rainstorm during evening rush hour, forcing Joe Girardi to organize a train ride into the city to avoid a four-hour bus ride. I remember Sammy Sosa taking a limo on his own, natch. I remember Mark Grace 's blond hair being fawned over by Japanese women. I remember a Cubs coach passing gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer, Teddy Greenstein, pleading with us to stay quiet about a snafu. Seems he was conferring with a Japanese writer on a daily basis, and after a lineup-card controversy involving opposing managers Don Baylor and Bobby Valentine, Greenstein told the writer that ' Baylor had a heart attack. ' // He did n't mean it literally, of course, but the Japanese writer interpreted it that way. Next thing you knew, the writer was reporting that Baylor, indeed on that March evening was : // What are we doing here? //
