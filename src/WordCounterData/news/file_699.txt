David T. Foster **33;826;TOOLONG <p> An emotional congregation gathered Sunday morning at Mount Carmel Baptist Church. Pastor Casey Kimbrough surveyed the gathering from the pulpit and took a couple of deep breaths. <p> " I can feel the anxiety and uncertainty here, " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything that happened last week very strongly. " <p> Kimbrough was referring to the shooting of two black men, Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, and the killing of five police officers in Dallas. <p> " Like churches all across America this morning, we stand here to pray for the families who lost their loved ones, " he said.

Goliath was the societal issues, like systemic racism and the dangers police officers face every day, Furtick said. <p> He said David would have never fought Goliath without doing smaller acts, like delivering cheese and bread to his brothers before the battle. Failure to do these small acts, Furtick said, can keep people from ever reaching the fight. <p> It is spreading love that will lead society toward fighting the real issues, Furtick said. <p> This week, Elevation Church is kicking off its annual Love Week, which seeks to bring people together and help address many of the needs facing Charlotte. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by providing food, clothing and doing neighborhood beautification projects. <p> " When the people of God do what we can, with the power we have, Goliath must fall, " he said. <h> Seek justice, not revenge <p> The street around First Baptist Church-West was a shell of what it had been -- felled trees, splintered branches, small shards of wood. <p> A storm Friday night had ravaged the neighborhood around the old brick church, but equally devastated were the congregants inside. Last week 's shootings were fresh in the memory of The Rev. Ricky Woods and his fellow churchgoers. <p> The pastor urged his congregation to seek justice, not revenge. <p> Justice should be the goal, he said, but the shock and sorrow of last week still lingered. <p> " What is a person of faith supposed to say in this moment? " Rev. Woods asked. " What can they say? <p> " If you get nothing else I say today, leave this place searching for justice, @ @ @ @
