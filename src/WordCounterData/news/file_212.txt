3041041 <p> At a time when the public is deluged with images of young black men being led away in handcuffs, Akram Faheem Al-Ahad 's story seemed irresistible. After spending much of his childhood in crime, 16-year-old Akram seemed poised to escape the streets. The King Center was grooming him to be a spokesman on non-violence. Two days after meeting reporter John Blake to tell his story, he was dead. <p> He was the embodiment of the remorseless felon, a sly College Park youth who committed his first crime at age 7 and once stole a car to visit his probation officer. <p> Yet people said Akram Faheem Al-Ahad did n't look the part. He had a baby face - chubby cheeks, a wisp of a mustache, and a wide smile that lit up his smooth features. <p> That was Akram. He surprised everyone who met him, until the very end. <p> By age 16, Akram appeared to have completed a quest to redeem himself. With the help of an ex-police officer, he seemed to have discarded his violent past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center was grooming him to be a spokesman for non- violence. A movie was planned on his life. <p> Then one Saturday afternoon, his mother found his nude body in a fetal position on their tiled bathroom floor. Akram had shut the door and shot himself in the face with a.357 Magnum. Authorities ruled it was an accident. <p> Torn between two worlds <p> Akram 's death stirred a flurry of questions, and then another Akram emerged. <p> Police said Akram robbed someone at gunpoint the day before he died. He was running with his old street buddies. He was fighting again. <p> What had been billed as the prison-to-promise story of a young man became a lesson on the fragile nature of that transition. Torn between two worlds, Akram felt whole in neither. His fate was a warning to everyone who has tried to reach one of the violent kids who now dominate the headlines. <p> " He was halfway around the curve, " said Charles Alphin Sr., who became his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that turn on the curve, and then he went off the road. " <p> ' I opened my eyes ' <p> His eyes stood out. Most 16-year-old boys posture, acting tough. But that was n't Akram 's style. His eyes radiated intelligence. He looked at people directly, gauging their reaction to his words, figuring them out. <p> That thoughtfulness was evident when he first decided to talk about himself one afternoon the last week of September. <p> At first glance, he seemed like any 16-year-old. While Akram was waxing his beloved Ford Mustang, two teenage girls shyly approached him. He broke out in a huge grin, and they flirted for several minutes. But he broke away from them, ready to tell his story. <p> In a cold, clinical tone, he described violence he had witnessed. But then, his speech became a gentle metaphor. <p> " I opened my eyes, " Akram said when asked why he changed. " Everybody is n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them. It 's just like a flower that you water. No matter how much you feed it, it 's going to take time. It 's not going to grow right then and there, but you can help it. " <p> Given up for dead at 3 <p> Akram spent much of his childhood growing up in the notoriously violent Red Oak Housing Project. There was little room for poetic sentiments there. <p> His life was a struggle from the start. At age 3, Akram was given up for dead by doctors because he had cancer. But he endured two years of chemotherapy to survive. <p> Overcoming the harsh environment at Red Oak proved more difficult. His mother, Jacquelyn Al-Ahad, divorced Akram 's father before he was born. She took Akram and his two older sisters to places like Zoo Atlanta and Fernbank, but he began getting into trouble with his teachers as early as elementary school. <p> Akram had no man to guide him. His mother requested male teachers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are elementary school teachers. <p> " Looks like every time he got into trouble in school, he had female instructors, " Al-Ahad said. " When they sent him to the principal : female. When they sent him to his mom : female. When he got home from school, he had his two sisters telling him to wash the dishes and clean up the room. " <p> A prodigy in the streets <p> Akram was placed in special education in school, but, in the streets, he became a prodigy. <p> Akram committed his first crime at 7. He broke into a house and kicked holes in the walls. He started stealing cars by 12. At 15, Akram was selling marijuana and robbing people at gunpoint. A steady exposure to violence hardened him. The first time Akram saw a man shot, he threw up. The second time, he became depressed. The third time, Akram shrugged at the incompetence of the shooting victim, a would- be armed robber shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " I thought, ' Do n't ever pull a gun out on anybody if you 're are n't going to shoot him, ' " Akram said. <p> When Akram was 15, College Park police arrested him and a friend after the duo led police on a 30-minute, high-speed chase that ended in a shootout. Akram was sentenced to a year in the Lorenzo Benn Youth Development Campus in June 1992. <p> Anne Strand, director of the youth prison, said Akram became " sullen " and " resistant. " Although Akram was diminutive at 5-foot-6, his counselor dubbed him " Doctor " because of his ability to manipulate people. <p> " He was very clever, " Strand said. " He could get other people to act out his stuff. If he wanted a certain thing to happen to certain people, he would set it up. " <p> We 're killing ourselves <p> Akram 's life seemed to change when he met Charles Alphin Sr. <p> Alphin, 52, is a towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 years as a St. Louis police officer, rising to the rank of captain in charge of homicide and narcotics. Before joining the police department, Alphin earned a reputation for using his fists. <p> " My background was violence, " he said. " I was raised in the street where, if you hit me, I took your head off. I liked to fight. " <p> Disenchanted with traditional methods of fighting violence, Alphin quit the police department and joined the King Center as a non-violent trainer. He eventually became the trainer for " All The King 's Men, " a six- month program created by Coretta Scott King that teaches " at-risk " youth how to settle conflict without violence. <p> In May, Akram heard about the program and asked if he could attend the weekly meetings. He was more interested in getting away from Lorenzo Benn than non-violence. But as he listened to Alphin talk every week about his experiences with violence, Akram begin to identify with him. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he made it, " Akram said. <p> A turning point in Selma <p> Alphin was intrigued by Akram 's thoughtful style, as well. But winning his trust took time. Alphin did it with persistence and kindness : giving him his home number, inviting him home for dinner with his wife, talking about everything from girls to Akram 's Mustang. <p> " I think we beat up on our youth, " Alphin said. " We 're afraid of them. We do n't trust them. They 're waiting for some love and understanding. And you ca n't buy it. You ca n't deliver it to them in the package. It has to be genuine, and it takes contact. It 's not a quick fix. " <p> Alphin showed Akram that another world existed outside of Red Oak. Through the King 's Men program, Alphin took Akram to Tuskegee University, to Selma, Ala., and to the 30th anniversary March on Washington. <p> Akram reached a turning point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march across the Edmund Pettus bridge, an elderly woman told Akram that she did n't suffer so young black men would grow up to kill one another and sell drugs. <p> Akram was shaken by the woman 's words. <p> " It opened me up, " Akram said. " I started thinking, ' Now we 're killing off ourselves. They do n't even have to do it anymore. That 's messed up, and I 'm contributing to it. ' " <p> ' I found out that I could write ' <p> Akram began to gravitate toward non-violence. He liked mind games, and non-violence was the ultimate psychological confrontation - to overcome someone who hates you without lifting a finger. <p> Then Alphin took another step. He helped Akram discover his talent. At Alphin 's urging, Akram began to speak about his experiences to other kids at the King Center. Then he spoke at the Carter Center, impressing the crowd. Alphin became a father figure to Akram. <p> " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not only did he help me with my self-esteem, but he helped me with finding my hidden talent. After that I started writing rhymes, songs, poems, speeches, anything I could think of. " <p> Akram began to think of a future without crime. During his last month at Lorenzo Benn, he wrote in his journal : <p> " I am going to open up a teenage club and make a lot of money without having to worry about looking over my shoulder and getting locked up. And then I 'm going to get my dream house. All this is possible with the help of God. " <p> Even Strand, the director at Lorenzo Benn, noticed the change. When violence erupted between kids from Savannah and Atlanta this summer, she asked Akram to teach both groups how to resolve conflicts with non- violence. <p> " We had never asked one of our students to be a mediator, or a peer counselor, " Strand said. " It was unprecedented. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A dizzying turn <p> The violence stopped after Akram talked to both groups. <p> Word got around. When so many young black men seemed hopelessly immersed in violence, Akram 's promise raised the hopes of so many people. They latched onto that promise. <p> Within months, Akram worked with WSB-TV on a non-violence workshop and became a panelist on a number of King Center workshops. He filmed a non-violence video for a local mentoring group for black boys and was mulling offers to do commercials supporting non-violence. <p> It was a dizzying turn for Akram. He was wanted but no longer by the police. <p> Akram was released from Lorenzo Benn in June. When he left, he gave two boxes of his clothes to a kid who was less fortunate. Akram was shedding his past. <p> His older sister, Freda, saw a different brother when school started in the fall. <p> " He actually got excited one day because he passed a science test. " <p> The dark side <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The kid who moved easily in a world of guns, intimidation and drugs was now spending his time in the plush corridors of the King Center. <p> Akram sought out his old friends. But they were n't interested. <p> " They said he was no longer one of them, " Alphin said. <p> Akram had no new set of friends to replace his old ones. He admitted that he did n't know how to relate to youths who did n't come from his background. He also had problems reconciling non-violence with the code that ruled the streets. <p> Two weeks before Akram died, a teenager broke into his Mustang and stole his gun, his sister said. Akram tracked him down and beat him up. For Akram, it was self-preservation. He said he was afraid to appear weak in front of others. <p> " I 'm not totally non-violent, " Akram said, explaining the incident. " You 're going to have to prove your point to them because they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not the one to be messed with. " <p> ' I wo n't do anything stupid ' <p> Akram also had to deal with something he had never encountered before - high expectations. <p> " I told him one day, ' A lot of people are depending on you. Do n't do anything stupid, ' " Alphin recalled. <p> " Do n't worry, I wo n't do anything stupid, " Akram responded. <p> But, like a recovering alcoholic, he slipped. He robbed someone, according to College Park Police Detective Ernest Strozier, the man who investigated Akram 's death. Weeks before he died, Akram purchased a.357 Magnum. The gun seller warned him it had " an easy trigger. " <p> The night before he died, Akram joined a couple of buddies for a night on the town. They used guns to steal money and drugs. Akram even bragged later that he had " made a good hit, " Strozier said. <p> " He fooled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to his old way of life. " <p> There was other pressure, too, something that even those closest to Akram did n't discover until after his death. His girlfriend was pregnant, Strozier said. A note found in Akram 's car asked : " Have you told your mother that you 're pregnant yet? " <p> When College Park Officer Willie Ralph saw Akram about two weeks before he died, he found a troubled young man. Akram 's mother complained to Ralph that her son was breaking his curfew. <p> " He told me he was under a lot of pressure, " Ralph said. " He said he did n't know if he could take it anymore. " <p> Preoccupied, no smiles <p> On Thursday, Sept. 30, Akram met with Alphin at the King Center to pose for pictures for this story. As he was introduced to a King Center employee, Akram did n't crack a smile. He appeared preoccupied, saying little as he posed with Alphin. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heading to Haiti to conduct non-violence workshops, would see Akram. <p> The next day, Friday, Akram called a friend, saying he was depressed. He did n't elaborate. He then called an old girlfriend and made a date. <p> On Saturday, at about 1:05 p.m., Akram made a date to go to the mall in less than a half-hour. He was alone at the time, listening to his favorite song, " Death Row, " by a rap group called " The Hard Boys. " <p> Strozier said Akram then walked into the bathroom, the only place in the crowded apartment where he was assured privacy, wearing only tennis shoes. He carried two guns. <p> Akram cleaned out the bathtub. Strozier said he put an unloaded.25- caliber automatic handgun on the floor. He then removed five bullets from the.357 Magnum. But one remained in the chamber. The gun was directly in front of his nose when it went off. <p> About 15 minutes later, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunsmoke still filled the air. She discovered Akram 's body after her nephew tried to open a locked bathroom door. <p> ' He was like a son ' <p> Fulton County Medical Examiner Mark Koponen ruled Akram 's death an accident, Strozier said. " Usually, a suicide will put the gun at his temple or mouth. " He is still awaiting routine toxicology reports that will tell whether he had taken any drugs. <p> Alphin, away in Haiti, did n't learn about Akram 's death until four days later. <p> " He was like a son, " said Alphin, his voice cracking. " I just wish I could have been there. " <p> On a blustery autumn afternoon, Akram was buried in Atlanta in a traditional Muslim ceremony. The sky turned gray, but it never rained. <p> About two weeks after the funeral, Akram 's mother went ahead with a planned move into a three-bedroom home in East Point. The home was in a tree-lined neighborhood, complete with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the driveway. <p> " Akram would have thought it was too quiet out here, " Al-Ahad said, smiling. Workers behind were hammering as they renovated the house. <p> Mother suspects murder <p> Al-Ahad suspects that her son was murdered. She does not believe he robbed anyone the night before or even owned the guns found at his side. She plans to write a book about him. <p> " He was the only one who really understood me, " Al-Ahad said quietly, as she sorted through a collection of Akram 's journals and poems. <p> Among Akram 's papers was a letter from the elderly woman who scolded him in Selma. The letter told Akram not to give up and wished him " good luck. " It arrived two days after Akram died. <p> For all the hope Akram inspired in people, his memory still evokes ambivalence. Some believe Akram remained a manipulator to the end. Others think he faltered because he could n't reconcile his two worlds. <p> Alphin said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't clean up a child 's mind and send him back to a dirty neighborhood, " he said. <p> Akram was not supposed to end up as a statistic. He was supposed to escape. But even he knew how fragile his quest for redemption was, judging by an essay he wrote during the last months of his life. <p> " Life is hard at times, and sometimes people give up too soon and never give their life a chance, " he wrote. " I have experienced different forms of failure in my life, from friends and family. I used to think that life was hard, but I found out that I make life for myself. I can make it hard or I can make it easy. I can make it bad, but it 's all up to me... "
