4198041 <p> A school district in Iowa is appealing a state board 's unanimous decision to transfer a student who was allegedly bullied by classmates and called a " snitch " after he reported overhearing locker room conversations about drugs and alcohol. <p> The teen, identified in state documents as K.M., should be allowed to transfer out of the Riverside Community School District, the Iowa Board of Education ruled Wednesday, according to the Des Moines Register. But the district will challenge the overturned decision during a hearing scheduled for September and could also appeal the ruling in district court. <p> " We want everyone to understand, we do not tolerate harassment and bullying, and we respond appropriately to such allegations when we 're made aware of them, " Superintendent Tim Mitchell told the newspaper. <p> Mitchell declined to discuss any reason why district officials are fighting the ruling and said only that they were considering their next move. <p> The state board found that the teen " reasonably feared for his safety and for his property " after the bullying began during the 2015-16 school year. Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " fat a -- " and an " a -- hole " and threatened to assault him if he told anyone about their classroom and locker room discussions about drug and alcohol use, according to Iowa State Board of Education documents. <p> " K.M. made it clear that he did not do drugs or alcohol and he would not take part in those activities, " the document continues. " On one occasion he told the school 's principal about their threats and Principal Gute talked to the students about it. After this happened several students were waiting for him to get out of the shower after gym class and threatened to beat him up in an area they called the ' dungeon ' at school. " <p> The boy lagged behind in a shower until the students left, but later found his clean clothes in a toilet. The boy 's mother later reported the incident to school officials. <p> The harassment continued into the following school year, culminating in March when three students started calling him a snitch. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party that several students had attended where drugs and alcohol were present, " according to the state board. " Someone called the police and they came and broke up the party. These students blamed K.M. for reporting about the party because K.M. has made it clear that he does not use drugs or alcohol. K.M. contacted his mom and she encouraged him to talk with the school counselor, Principal Gute, or to ignore them. " <p> Later that afternoon, the boy went to track practice and, when he returned to his car, found the word " snitch " painted on its windshield. <p> The boy 's father filed paperwork seeking a transfer just five days after the vandalism incident, but missed a March deadline by nearly two weeks, according to the Des Moines Register. <p> The state board voted 8-0 on Wednesday to reverse the transfer denial, with one member abstaining. <p> " Finally, the use of the word ' snitch ' indicates that K.M. has been targeted for harassment and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school authorities and police, " the state board concluded. " That being the case, it seems likely that any further efforts by school officials would be likely to exacerbate, not alleviate, the harassment K.M. experiences. " <p> An attorney representing the school district argued that the state board 's decision denies the school an opportunity to alleviate the matter. <p> The boy, meanwhile, will be allowed to attend a different high school this fall as the appeal unfolds.
