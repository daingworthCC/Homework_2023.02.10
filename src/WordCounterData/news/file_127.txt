3026541 <p> They call it the Miami Heat way of doing things. <p> It seems to be working. Going into tonight 's National Basketball Association games, the Heat - in only their fourth season of existence - are in the thick of the playoff race, 1 1/2 games behind New Jersey and Atlanta for the final two of eight playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Miami has five games left. New Jersey and Atlanta each have six games left. <p> " I think for us just to be in a position to be playing in important games this time of year is great, " says coach Kevin Loughery. " The last two weeks are going to have a lot of pressure, but it 's good pressure and fun pressure. " <p> How did the Heat get here so quickly while the other three expansion teams have struggled so? The Heat( 35-42) have more wins than Orlando( 19) and Minnesota( 14) combined. <p> " Not once did we ever waver from our basic concept, " says managing partner Lewis Schaffel. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft. Our goal has been to get as many good players as we can, keep them together, teach them and show patience, patience, patience. <p> " There 's one thing great about starting something new. You 're not left with the residue of the old. We have a Miami Heat way of doing things, and it 's an 11-month commitment for the players and the coaches. " <p> A look at the Heat 's roster reveals that guards Brian Shaw and John Morton are the only players who have played for another NBA team. <p> Morton was signed as a free agent after being cut by Cleveland. Shaw was acquired earlier this season from the Celtics for point guard Sherman Douglas, who led the Heat in scoring and assists last season. <p> The Heat 's starting lineup of forwards Glen Rice and Grant Long, center Rony Seikaly and guards Shaw and rookie Steve Smith averages only 25 years of age, and the 12-man active roster averages only 24.6. None is older than 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper. Seikaly, Smith, Rice, Willie Burton and Kevin Edwards are all first-round picks of the Heat.( Burton left the team Wednesday to be treated for depression and will miss the last five games. He had been troubled by tendinitis in his right knee and his playing time had been cut.) <p> They were picked for a reason : They were the best players available at the time. <p> " We always took the best player available, regardless of position, " says Schaffel. " We took Steve Smith this season, even though we already had Sherman Douglas and Bimbo( Coles). That 's our philosophy. We ca n't afford to make mistakes in the draft, and the chance of making an error is greater if you draft for need or by position instead of taking the best player. You might have too much at one position, but that 's better than not having enough. " <p> The Heat enjoy playing with each other and, because of their closeness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no veteran cynicism here, " says Schaffel. <p> " This is like a family, " adds the 6-11 1/2 Seikaly, 26, the team 's underrated and quickly improving center. He was the first player the team drafted. " We 're very close, and we 're all growing up together. " <p> And growing up quickly. <p> Loughery has had a lot to do with that. <p> Former Detroit Pistons assistant Ron Rothstein guided the Heat their first three seasons. They improved in each of them, going from 15 wins to 18 to 24. He was replaced after last season by Loughery, a popular former player and one of the most-traveled former head coaches in the league. He has had stints with the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls and Washington Bullets. <p> " At different times, a different outlook, a different touch, a different guiding hand is necessary, " Schaffel says in explaining the switch to Loughery. " The Ronnie Rothstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team those first three years was a foundation. He sowed the seeds. He was so intense that he may have just burned himself out. <p> " What Kevin has offered is a totally different perspective, " Schaffel adds. " He 's an ex-player and sees the world through a player 's perspective. He realizes it 's a player 's game, and he 's allowed the players to experience their own quality of skill. He was just the right person at the right time. " <p> Loughery likes a more up-tempo game, and the Heat are averaging four more points than last year. " The players want to play it that way, and that 's important, " he says. <p> The Heat are young and eager but also very talented. <p> Steve Smith, at 6-8, is the league 's tallest starting point guard. Until knee surgery set him back, he was a candidate for Rookie of the Year. Though not nearly 100%, he still averages 12.4 points and 4.5 assists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 14.9 points and 8.4 rebounds, and there are plenty of key role players like Coles, Shaw, Edwards and Burton. But the team 's stars are clearly Seikaly and Rice. <p> Rice has established himself as one of the NBA 's premier outside shooters. He leads the team in scoring with a 21.7 average( 11th overall) and is averaging 4.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists. He is also second in the NBA in three-point shots attempted( 366) and made( 143) and is 14th in three-point percentage(.391). <p> In a subtle move, Loughery, in February, moved the 6-8 Rice from guard to small forward, and he has thrived. He rebounds better from that position, and his shooting range makes him one of the league 's most difficult players to guard. <p> " I know my shot is a gift, " he says. " I know I can be a star. It 's just a matter of how bad I want it - and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has increased from 13.6 his rookie season to 17.4 last season to where it is now, Seikaly has also shown marked improvement. He has increased his scoring and rebounding averages in each of his four seasons and his 12.0 rebounds a game currently ranks him sixth in the league. <p> As confident as they are in their individual abilities, the Heat also feel they will get to the playoffs this season. <p> " I think we 've responded to the playoff pressure pretty well, especially since we do n't have many veterans, " says Rice. <p> " We just have to maintain our composure and play like we know we can. " <p> Adds Seikaly : " Usually this time of season, we 're looking to summer vacation, but this time we 're playing for the playoffs. I like this way a lot better. " <p> The schedule is certainly in Miami 's favor. They have home games left against New Jersey, Milwaukee and Orlando and games at Washington and Boston. The Celtics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " If we just get to the playoffs, it 'll be a great accomplishment for the organization, " says Rice. " And it 'll hurt if we do n't make it. We are at a point where I wo n't settle for anything less than being in the playoffs. " <p> That 's the Miami Heat way of doing things. CUTLINE : RONY SEIKALY : Center is sixth in league in rebounding. CUTLINE : KEVIN LOUGHERY : Playoff pressure ' good, fun. '
