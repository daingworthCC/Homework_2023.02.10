4133341 Tony Stewart returns to Watkins Glen International on Sunday a changed man after terrible accidents in sprint car races the last two years forced him out at a venue where he has a record five victories. Stewart broke his right leg in an Iowa sprint car race shortly before the Watkins Glen race in 2013. He then sat out last year 's event after his car struck and killed driver Kevin Ward Jr. on Aug. 9, the night before Stewart was scheduled to race at the Glen. Stewart sat out three Sprint Cup races while he tried to deal emotionally with the tragedy and the criminal investigation. He had not spoken publicly about it in detail this season until Wednesday at Texas Motor Speedway, where he told reporters he was trying to not think about the anniversary. " I do n't think I 'll ever be the same from what happened the last two years, " said Stewart, who was leading the annual " Smoke Show " Fantasy Camp for charity. " I do n't know how you could be. I do n't know how anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But not being back exactly the same I was does n't mean I( have n't) become better in some ways. There are always positives that come out of every scenario. " Stewart was competing in a sprint-car race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York when he and Ward, 20, were involved in an on-track incident. During the ensuing caution, Ward jumped out of his car and walked down the track 's surface to motion at Stewart. Stewart hit him in what he later called " 100% an accident. " Nearly seven weeks later, a grand jury declined to charge Stewart. A toxicology report revealed Ward was under the influence of marijuana at a level high enough to cloud judgment. As the anniversary approaches, Stewart wrestles with those memories and other troubled waters on the track, where his performance has been lackluster. It has been challenging for Stewart, 44, who carries a reputation as one of the best ever in NASCAR and one of the top wheelmen in international motor sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a future Hall of Famer, he seems to be trying to sprint out of quicksand. He has tried to focus on activities that take his mind away from the fast lane of race cars and the black cloud that, he has admitted, will never go away. " It 's always going to be part of my life the rest of my life, " he has said. One such endeavor is tending to Eldora Speedway, which hosts a Camping World Truck Series race in July as the crown jewel on a full slate at the track Stewart owns in Rossburg, Ohio. Stewart also is playing golf, but not well. He 's still looking for his first round under 100 because, as he told USA TODAY Sports, " I count every shot. Shot 121 the other day. " Two years ago, few Stewart associates could imagine him having any sort of attraction to a game as low-key and time-consuming as golf. But, still not fully recovered from a compound fracture of his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to the rehabilitation that was necessary after a string of surgeries on his mangled leg, Stewart is notorious for avoiding the weight room and for enjoying a Wendy 's Frosty and a burger now and then. Any exercise, even the slow pace of golf, is a good thing. But Stewart still has n't returned to his passion -- racing sprint cars. Carrying burden The Stewart struggle is felt throughout the garage area, where he retains almost universal respect, and into the higher reaches of the grandstands. " To be competitive in this business, you have to live it, breathe it, eat it 24 hours a day, " Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage, a close friend of Stewart, told USA TODAY Sports. " The things that have happened to Tony, in particular the incident last August, have hung with him, as they would anybody. Even if it 's just a few minutes now and then that something comes back to him, it 's part of the burden he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other guys are pressing ahead 24/7. " Since he broke his leg, Stewart has three top-fives and nine top-10s. Through 21 Sprint Cup races this season, he has scored two top-10 finishes, has led 14 laps and sits 25th in points, behind all of his Stewart-Haas Racing teammates( Kevin Harvick is first, Kurt Busch ninth and Danica Patrick 22nd). Stewart had a momentary bright spot two weeks ago at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, his home track, qualifying fourth for the Jeff Kyle 400 at the Brickyard. But race day turned into another disappointment as Stewart failed to lead a lap and finished 28th. He was a non-factor at the front Sunday at Pocono Raceway, finishing ninth but failing to lead a lap. Stewart, a road course ace who leads the circuit with nine career victories at those tracks, could have a solid opportunity to win and qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup this weekend. Stewart has said he and his team have had trouble adjusting to NASCAR 's rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performance. " I feel like every weekend( is) the weekend we 're going to find it, " Stewart told a national media teleconference last month. " It 's disheartening,( and it) takes the wind out of your sails when you realize you have n't found it that week. " Stewart 's fans, a dedicated bunch, have traveled through the tough times. " It 's hard to imagine what he 's gone through, " said Sheridan, Ind., resident Bonnie Jeffries, sporting a well-worn T-shirt with Stewart 's No. 14 across the front. " I do n't think I could ever go to a racetrack again. I 'm glad he 's hung with it, and we 're all hoping he 'll get back to winning again. " Stewart is seen by many as the epitome of the old school racer, a rough and tough driver who asks no quarter and gives none and takes on officials, journalists, other drivers and anyone else who stands in his way. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't lost the devotion of a solid fan base. " Tony will win again, " said Stewart fan Robert Harkins of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. " He 's too good to let all this completely stop him. It will just take some time. He 's been through a lot. " " Tony is n't a talker ; he 's a driver, " said Cincinnati resident Tommy Blount, who said he has followed Stewart since the driver 's Indy-car days. " He does n't take anything off anybody, and I like it. I want a driver who 's full bore all the time. " To see him go through all this stuff the past couple of years has been hard, but the hardest part has been on him. " Escaping to Eldora For Stewart, Eldora trumps all other recreational endeavors. He bought the classic dirt track in 2004 from founder Earl Baltes and has worked to make steady improvements but also to retain the short-track flavor that makes the speedway a favorite of dirt racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a place that provides an escape from the woes that linger. Stewart drives tractors at Eldora. He is very involved in preparing the track surface -- a tricky task that can make or break competition on a given night -- and, in fact, was circling the speedway 's dirt until 4 the morning of the truck series race last month. " I like to think that Tony knows when he comes here that our team has our stuff buttoned up, " track manager Roger Slack told USA TODAY Sports. " He can relax knowing that the I 's are dotted and the T 's are crossed. He can pay attention to the things he wants to pay attention to and the things he enjoys focusing on. " If Stewart is not on a tractor or some other agricultural device pampering the Eldora clay, he 's navigating the infield on a four-wheeler, stopping occasionally to offer friendly harassment to friends and hangers-on. On truck series race day, he seemed very much at home in a faded Bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other parts of his life lost somewhere in the distance. The escape was similar to one in January, when Stewart traveled to Tulsa for the Chili Bowl, a key Midget race. There he joined the track preparation crew in making lap after lap on tractors getting the surface ready between races. Few had seen him happier since that dark day last August. " I was sitting up in the VIP section last year watching the race, and I told( track operator) Emmett( Hahn), ' I can do this if you want, ' " Stewart told USA TODAY Sports in January. " We know what we 're looking for. Drivers know how to make these surfaces work. " Playing in the dirt clearly is an escape valve for Stewart. " He has always told me that the Cup stuff is work and the sprint car stuff was just fun, " Gossage said. " He 's threatened many times when he 's frustrated to just chuck it all and go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so much more than I think people think it did. He ca n't really race sprint cars right now, and I do n't know if he ever will, which is sad, because it 's what he truly, truly loves. So this( Eldora) is a way for him to be involved in it. " He seems totally at home doing that. You see a different guy. He 's having fun. You can see that look in his eyes. He 's mischievous. You see him at a Cup race right now, and it 's not a pleasant thing to see. " With the calendar increasingly limiting his chances, Stewart seeks the race victory that could push him into the Chase for the first time since 2012. That is more important than Eldora. But not as much fun. Contributing : Jeff Gluck
