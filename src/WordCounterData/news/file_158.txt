3032041 <p> MAMARONECK, N.Y. -- Hardly a head turned as New Zealand 's Michael Campbell cut across Winged Foot 's practice putting green this week. Tiger Woods ' golf bag, with caddie Steve Williams sitting on it, captured more attention than the defending U.S. Open champion. <p> Campbell chatted up Padraig Harrington, not about golf but a wager for this weekend 's rugby match between New Zealand 's All Blacks and Harrington 's Irish team. Williams spotted his fellow Kiwi, a hero in his homeland yet mostly anonymous in the USA, and could n't resist giving him the needle. " We were just talking about you, " Williams said. " Come over here and listen, you might learn something. " <p> Campbell smiled and laughed. He walked briskly through the crowd toward the first tee, covering the 100 yards with only three fans asking for an autograph. <p> Indeed, few if any past U.S. Open champions have been given so little chance to repeat. Campbell, who had missed four consecutive U.S. Open cuts before last year, rates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1988-89 to win back-to-back titles. <p> For Campbell, 37, that 's more motivation as he flies under the radar against the backdrop of Woods ' return and Phil Mickelson 's quest for a third major in a row. <p> " Fantastic, bring it on, " he says. " Let Tiger and Vijay( Singh) and Phil have all the attention, and I can just do what I did last year. " <p> His lack of momentum is strikingly similar to a year ago when he arrived at Pinehurst( N.C.) No. 2 beaten down by several missed cuts. He has missed three in a row as a non-member on the PGA Tour, where his scoring average for five tournaments is 73.2 -- which would be third from last among Tour members. He also missed the cut in his last event on the European Tour, where he 's averaging 71.36 strokes, tied for 36th. Putting is the major culprit. <p> " He can get very, very hot and very, very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can do anything at any given time. It 's just a matter of the right ingredients coming together. " <p> The role of a champion <p> Fellow competitors knew of his talent, but outside of golf circles Campbell 's two-shot victory against Woods at Pinehurst last year was a stunning achievement. Nowhere more than in Campbell 's hometown of Wellington, New Zealand, where about 120,000 came out for a ticker-tape parade. <p> " I was one of them, " says Larry Graham, the CEO of New Zealand Golf in Wellington. " It was a fantastic occasion, and the city of Wellington went nuts, to put it mildly. " <p> Four strokes behind leader Retief Goosen to start the final round last year, Campbell fired a 1-under-par 69 and failed to wilt amid a late charge by Woods. He joined Bob Charles( 1963 British Open) as the only New Zealanders with a major title. <p> Campbell 's triumph riveted his country to such an extent the government suspended parliament to watch. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 45-cent postage stamp. <p> A five-year exemption on the PGA Tour came with his victory, but Campbell turned down membership to continue playing an international schedule. That victory, and his support of European events, earned him an honorary life membership to the European Tour. <p> Campbell often carried the U.S. Open trophy with him during the past year and found it difficult to let go, literally kissing it goodbye before shipping it back to U.S. Golf Association headquarters last month. <p> He enjoyed the last few perks of his reign, too. <p> He was awarded the Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit by Prince Charles on Friday at Buckingham Palace. Campbell was in Manhattan on Monday morning to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. He threw out the first pitch for the Cleveland Indians-New York Yankees game Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. <p> Campbell also was thrust into being a role model, a responsibility he has n't taken lightly. He received guidance on how to conduct himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reminded Campbell of the influence he wielded, especially in his country. <p> Graham says : " Cambo embraces everything that is New Zealand. He 's a great sportsman. He 's a great ambassador for New Zealand. He loves New Zealand. " <p> Campbell announced Tuesday the launch of the Michael Campbell Foundation and a program to award scholarships to promising young golfers from disadvantaged backgrounds in New Zealand. <p> " This is consistent with his goals to help inspire and motivate young people, " Helen Clark, prime minister of New Zealand, said in a prepared release. <p> Instead of just writing a check, Campbell plans to give his time by working to raise donations and earmarking part of his endorsement deals for charity. <p> " What I say now really matters back home. My opinion matters, which is quite scary sometimes, " Campbell says. <p> " On my shoulders right now is the weight of New Zealand golf. I know that for a fact, and I know that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive energy. I just feel it. With my experience, with my knowledge, I can pass it on down to the future generations of junior golf. " <p> Graham attributes the increase in junior programs around the country directly to Campbell 's U.S. Open win : " For such a small country, Cambo has had a big impact. " <p> Confidence is not lacking <p> On the course, the perception persists that Campbell hit the lottery and might be a one-time major winner, a list that includes 116 players. Only 32 players have won at least a second major title. <p> Australian Mark Hensby disagrees, believing that would n't be the case if Campbell had opted for a full PGA Tour schedule. <p> " Just because you do n't play on the U.S. tour does n't mean you have n't done anything, " says Hensby, who moonlights on the European Tour. " You 'd see him up there( on the scoreboard) all the time. " <p> Campbell also might note the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their title. Of the last 10 winners, Goosen had the best finish, a tie for 11th last year. <p> " Look at last year. No one gave me a chance to win, and I won, " Campbell says. " I do n't care what you guys think or write or say, but I know I have a chance. I could have said it until I was blue in the face last year, but no one would listen to me, which is great. <p> " The whole year is repeating itself. Yeah, let them have all the attention ; let them have all the hoopla with it. I 'm just going to go out there and play golf. " <p> His preparation for this Open consisted of events in Europe where notoriously lumpy greens can wreak havoc with putting. Yarwood believes that 's the only weakness in Campbell 's game. <p> " It sort of affected his confidence a little bit over there, and all of a sudden his scores took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling apart, " Yarwood says. <p> " It has n't. He 's hitting it very well. We just need to get the putting back in order, his speed control, his left wrist breaking down, which makes him pull the putts. That 's the whole mandate for this week. " <p> Campbell tied for fourth in the PGA Tour 's season-opening Mercedes Championships. But then he was ousted in the first round of the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship and was gone by the weekend in the Bay Hill Invitational, The Players Championship and The Masters. His best finish on the European Tour was a tie for fifth in the British Masters in May. <p> None of that worries Campbell. He proudly embodies his Maori heritage and relies on the spirit of " Kia Kaha, " an expression in his native language that means stay strong through hard times. <p> " I 'm a person who rides on a wave for a very long time. I 'm like a switch, and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " And I feel that being here this week makes me very at ease with myself and very comfortable with my defense. I 'm feeling very, very confident right now. " <p> He believes enough in his game to split time between tours. As a PGA Tour player, he must compete in 15 events to keep full-time privileges each year, something he failed to do in 2003 when he was a member. Because he declined membership, Campbell can play a maximum of 10 events this season. He asked for a special allowance into more tournaments but was denied. <p> " I feel I was penalized somewhat, " says Campbell, who plans to move to Orlando next year and eventually try to play more on the PGA Tour. <p> As Campbell reached the first tee for his practice round, he asked what Williams had to say about him. Told his fellow Kiwi was rooting for him this week, Campbell flashed back to the scene at Pinehurst, where Williams met him on the 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were celebrating in their homeland. <p> " What with Tiger hunting me down last year, it must be hard for him emotionally to detach from me winning, " Campbell says with a grin. <p> Not really, Williams says. <p> " If it 's not Tiger winning a golf tournament, I 'm as proud a Kiwi as there is. It was fantastic. I enjoyed it as much as anyone else in New Zealand. " PHOTOS, B/W, Julie Jacobson, AP( 2)
