3069541 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named after an executive charged with tax evasion. Another executive speaks during a graduation ceremony but resigns two weeks later amid a federal investigation into his company. <p> Some of the mud flying in the wake of America 's corporate scandals is landing on the ivory towers of academia. Boardroom misdeeds are fueling criticism that business schools, which rely heavily on corporate largess, are n't doing enough to teach ethics and social responsibility. <p> Most business schools offer at least one or two ethics classes, but critics say they must work harder to place values on equal footing with the bottom line. They also must do more to protect their image as places of independent thought and learning. <p> ' Business schools are good at producing skilled managers, but what we need are leaders, ' said Judy Samuelson, who heads the Aspen Institute 's Initiative for Social Innovation Through Business. ' What are they in business to do, if it 's not to create leaders for society? ' <p> President Bush singled out business schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be principled teachers of right and wrong, and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism. ' <p> But there are notable thinkers, such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, who argue that ethics are the realm of families and elementary schools, not universities. <p> Sally Keefe, a 31-year-old MBA student at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder, agrees. <p> ' People 's values are pretty well formed by the time they reach an MBA program, ' she said. ' How much is your outlook going to change at this point in life? The time to impact people 's values is when they 're much younger. ' <p> Confidence in business schools clearly has eroded. In February, a Senate committee erupted in laughter when former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, explaining that he had little understanding of accounting, noted he attended Harvard Business School. <p> A big reason ethics still receive secondary treatment at many business schools is money. It takes a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elective class. <p> The University of Denver received $ 11 million in matching funds in 1988 from the late Denver cable entrepreneur Bill Daniels to establish a comprehensive ethics curriculum. CU 's Leeds school received a $ 35 million grant last year from New York publisher and CU graduate Michael Leeds for the same purpose. <p> Top-tier schools such as Harvard and Stanford have established business-ethics centers with multimillion-dollar endowments. <p> But schools sometimes find that hefty corporate contributions are double-edged, particularly now that business ethics have come under fire. <p> A gift from businessman L. Dennis Kozlowski during the 1990s enabled Seton Hall University 's business school in New Jersey to build a new building. Now the former Tyco International chief executive is charged with tax evasion( he has pleaded not guilty) and is being investigated by the company for possibly using corporate funds for personal use. <p> Oklahoma State University alumnus Chuck Watson and his firm, Dynegy, gave $ 1 million for a new academic program and trading floor at the school. Watson resigned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, just two weeks after he spoke at OSU 's graduation ceremonies. <p> Even DU finds itself associated with disgraced executives, though indirectly. Adelphia Communications founder John Rigas and members of his family, who last week were arrested for allegedly bilking investors out of more than $ 60 billion, has contributed $ 1.5 million to the Cable Center. <p> Though separate from DU, the center is based on the university 's campus and partners with the school on cable-related educational programs. Cable Center officials say they 'll wait for the outcome of a potential Rigas trial before deciding whether they will name a new theater after Rigas. <p> There are many examples of similar connections, including gifts and endowed professorships by Enron, Arthur Andersen, Global Crossing and WorldCom. <p> While the association with these companies and executives is embarrassing, schools say they 'll keep the named buildings and professorships unless a donor is convicted of a crime or the promised money stops coming. <p> Specialists in business ethics say the debate over business schools is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national spotlight for the first time in more than a decade. <p> ' It has confirmed what a number of schools felt at the end of the 1980s, the so-called decade of greed, ' said Bruce Hutton, a University of Denver marketing professor who helped DU 's Daniels College of Business develop its ethics curriculum in the early 1990s. <p> ' Business schools were being criticized for not doing enough. That really kicked off a movement to include ethics education in schools, ' he said. ' But a lot of schools did n't choose to really make the commitment to integrate ethical education into their curriculum. They took a less rigorous route, offering it as a single elective course. ' <p> Corporate recruiters typically do n't put a high value on what ethics courses graduates have taken, Hutton said, giving schools little incentive to do more than the minimum. The issue also is n't a major factor in traditional graduate school rankings. <p> Nonetheless, the recent scandals are causing universities to re-examine their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are adding new ethics courses. Colorado State University 's business school said July 18 it will add a new graduate-level business ethics course and integrate the issue into its undergraduate curriculum. <p> The closest thing to a ranking of business schools ' ethics programs is a semiannual survey by the Aspen Institute and the World Resources Institute, both nonprofits. The survey, Beyond Grey Pinstripes, ranks schools based on their commitment to social responsibility and environmental protection. <p> The most recent report, last fall, found that while some schools committed significant resources to these issues, most did not, Samuelson said. The majority of 122 schools that responded said they offered a ' social-impact ' management or business ethics class only as an elective. <p> ' When it 's isolated in an ethics week cq with members of family for allegedly looting millions from the company 's treasury. <p> Education : Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, B.S. <p> Alumni activities/awards : Contributed $ 1.5 million to the Cable Center, which has ties to the University of Denver. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Name : Jeffrey Skilling <p> Position : Former CEO, Enron <p> Charge or matter under investigation : Bankrupt company created outside partnerships that allegedly hid billions of dollars in losses. <p> Education : Southern Methodist University, B.A. ; Harvard University, MBA <p> Alumni activities/awards : SMU appointed Skilling to its board of trustees in June 2001. <p> Name : Scott Sullivan <p> Position : Former CFO, WorldCom <p> Charge or matter under investigation : Bankrupt company allegedly booked billions in expenses as long-term costs. <p> Education : State University of New York at Oswego, B.S. <p> Alumni activities/awards : Served as member of board of directors. <p> Name : Chuck Watson <p> Position : Former CEO, Dynegy Inc. <p> Charge or matter under investigation : Investigators are probing the company 's accounting and energy-trading practices. <p> Education : Oklahoma State University, B.S. <p> Alumni activities/awards : Watson, an OSU board member, and Dynegy donated $ 1 million in 2000 toward creation of new academic program and energy-trading floor. <p> Name : Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or matter under investigation : Firm is under investigation for alleged improper accounting practices and obstruction of justice. <p> Education : C.W.

' <p> The institute also surveyed students, who gave faculty members a D-plus for raising environmental or social topics in core classes, and gave their classmates a C. <p> On campus, students often are the driving force behind strengthening a school 's ethical offerings. <p> ' One of the problems with academia is that it 's compartmentalized.

At Daniels, a finance professor refused to include a case study on socially responsible practices in his class because, he said, it was covered in the ethics class. But other professors have been more receptive, Miner said. <p> Keefe, the CU business-school student and leader of Net Impact at Leeds, said universities are moving in the right direction, but slowly. <p> ' The frustrating thing about business education is it 's not like change happens very swiftly, ' she said.
