3025741 <p> Business travelers who like to do everything themselves should like this. Thomas Cook Travel has introduced a do-it-yourself reservations system for corporate clients. Its Express Planner helps you plan your itinerary and book airline flights without talking to a travel agent. " It 's another step forward in the automation of the travel process, " says corporate travel consultant Harold Seligman. Unlike some services that require a personal computer, all you need to use Express Planner is a touch-tone phone and a facsimile machine. <p> Here 's how it works : You dial a local Thomas Cook number and an automated voice directs you through a series of steps. You punch in the area code of the city you 're visiting and the applicable airport codes, which are found in a guidebook provided by Thomas Cook. Then the system asks you for dates and times of travel. About 90 seconds after the call, you get a fax showing the best available flights and fares. To make reservations, you call the Thomas Cook number again. After that, you 'll receive another fax showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express Planner is n't set up yet to actually book hotel reservations. The system hooks callers up to a help desk staffed by a real person for that part. Seligman says it 's not practical for a complicated itinerary either - you 'd spend a lot of time on the phone punching in numbers. " For the knowledgeable traveler or travel arranger, it is a useful tool, " says Seligman. " The question is, are we ready to deal with machines rather than people? For the techie, it 's a great idea. For the average person that wants to ask questions about itineraries, it 's got a way to go.

In two cases, jet fuel or hydraulic fluid leaked into an auxiliary power unit, which caused fumes to leak into the cabin.

" We suspect the problem is a lack of proper ventilation in the cabin.

" Right now, we ca n't find the problem, but we continue to investigate it. " <p> Better to be bumped <p> Being bumped from a Northwest Airlines flight is getting more rewarding. Northwest has told gate agents to be more generous in offering incentives - including coupons for free future flights - to coax passengers into giving up their seats on oversold flights. The goal is to reduce the number of people that get bumped involuntarily on Northwest. <p> Airlines typically offer free-flight coupons when they need to free up seats. In the past, Northwest employees were n't offering enough of them. Northwest also is offering people more than just free tickets, but spokesman Doug Miller wo n't say what.
