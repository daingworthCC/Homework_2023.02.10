3048741 <p> In a climate of tough competition and high salaries, the way chefs move around can be as intriguing as a chess game. <p> For example : What possessed Denis Soriano, who recently earned four stars for his food at the chic and intimate Chez Michel, to move to the high-volume Grand Cafe on Geary Street, which garnered no stars for food when it opened about 18 months ago? <p> Reeling from the loss of Soriano, Chez Michel owner Michel Elkaim hired Alain Redelsperger, who had been top dog at the now defunct Bistro M. That venture, Los Angeles celebrity restaurateur Michel Richard 's doomed entry into the San Francisco market, opened a couple of years ago and closed earlier this year. On our last visit there, Redelsperger 's food earned two stars. <p> These strategic moves raise several interesting questions, and the answers are not as obvious as they seem : What happens to the food from a mediocre kitchen that 's taken over by a four-star chef? And, with only a half-dozen or so four-star restaurants in the city, can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We decided to take another look at both restaurants, and here 's what we found. <p> GRAND CAFE <p> After our standard three visits, we were perplexed because Soriano 's food remained so flat. True, the chef went from an intimate, 46-seat restaurant to one that seats more than 250( including the bar), but we found scarce indication of his immense talent at work. <p> At deadline time, we called the restaurant and found that he had started several weeks later than we thought and he was still producing the old menu. We were told that a new menu was on the way, so we decided to give the chef a few more weeks to get comfortable in his new surroundings. <p> A month later we returned and found that about half the dishes were new. Although the kitchen had improved, the quality only faintly resembles that which Soriano produced at Chez Michel. <p> The roast chicken( $ 10.95) is a good indication of how much work is left to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and if we closed our eyes we 'd swear we were eating turkey. On the final visit, the chicken still tasted as if it had been prepared ahead, plus it looked as if the crew had tried to bring it back to life with a quick saute to caramelize the flesh. Unfortunately, the texture was still all wrong. <p> A chicken breast stuffed with a duxelles( $ 10.95) was a food stylist 's dream from the outside, with mahogany-colored skin. But when the knife cut through the meat, the sickly brown stuffing, which had the texture of baby food, oozed out in unattractive globs. <p> For lunch one day we had one of the saddest pastas in recent memories. While it looked good, the stuffed sweet potato tortellini( $ 12.25) was as sweet as dessert and the pasta had a rubber-band texture. A crab-filled ravioli( $ 13.25) did n't fare much better on the final visit. The unappetizingly dense pasta was bathed in a sauce that tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chef 's reputation I would have sworn it was canned. <p> However, if you order carefully, some dishes are worthy of the fabulous interior that looks as if it was taken from Paris and recon structed in San Francisco. The massive columns, painted with a harlequin pattern, lead the eye up 30 feet to the grand ceiling and massive chandeliers. All around the restaurant are whimsical bronze sculptures of rabbitlike figures in acrobatic poses, adding a playful touch to the elegantly casual decor. <p> Some menu items that show glimmers of hope include a rich and moist duck leg confit( $ 8.95) on a frisee salad with walnut dressing, and a creamy duck terrine with liver mousse( $ 5.95) that had a marvelous meaty texture. It was accompanied by a frisee salad surrounded by dark drizzles of balsamic and delicate coins of sliced cornichons. <p> The polenta souffle( $ 7.95) with wild mushroom ragout had a wonderful flavor but would have been even better without contrasting temperatures of the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main courses show promise, but often one element keeps them from reaching their potential. Grilled salmon( $ 16.95) served on a bed of lentils infused with fennel was a superb special in November, but in December the dish was changed. The same succulent salmon was served over a bed of diced yellow beets and yellow Finn potatoes. Both vegetables were so flavorless they were indistinguishable from one another. <p> The filet mignon( $ 19.95) had a pleasing crustiness, but it retained a fishy flavor as if it had been placed on the grill right after a hunk of salmon had finished cooking. The bed of lima beans and corn and the rich bone marrow sauce showed immense style and skill, however. <p> One of the best desserts( all $ 5.95), a stylized banana cream pie, was removed from the menu and replaced with a just-OK gingerbread in a gooey apple sauce that did n't add much. An ordinary polenta pound cake did n't match the quality of the spiced cranberries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Unfortunately, the service was somewhat annoying on four of our five visits. The house style seems to be intrusive. Are the waiters secretly actors waiting to be discovered by some hungry producer? They continually make snappy comments and insert themselves into private conversations, but then disappear when you need them. <p> Overall Soriano has improved the food, but it 's still puzzling why he has n't had more of an impact. Maybe OK is good enough because Grand Cafe is one of the prettiest casual restaurants in the city ; the place is always packed. Still, it 's sad to see a restaurant that refuses to live up to its potential. <p> CHEZ MICHEL <p> It 's also sad to see a restaurant that once achieved its potential fall back. With Alain Redelsperger at the helm, the food at Chez Michel is competent but does n't sparkle in a way that sets it apart. <p> Still, with such competent service and stylish surroundings, even a McDonald 's hamburger would taste great. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumin-laced black bean sauce( $ 19) comes immediately to mind -- seemed out of place in this white-tablecloth setting. <p> After one bite of the buttery beef tenderloin and rich mashed potatoes I began to curse the addition of the inky black bean sauce pooled -- at the bottom of the plate. The cumin overpowered everything and the dusty texture and rustic flavor of the beans really seemed out of kilter. <p> Likewise, a delicate ceviche( $ 9.75) of thinly sliced scallops was overpowered by pungent radish sprouts and a puckery citrus dressing. And the roasted Atlantic cod( $ 19) did n't have a chance with the heavy bordelaise sauce. The accompanying couscous presented in a phyllo cup was good, but the presentation looked a little peculiar. <p> Many dishes suffered from one overpowering element : the pungent olive sauce on braised rabbit with pancetta and fennel( $ 19), for instance, and the particularly unappetizing presentation of the otherwise laudatory crispy Chilean sea bass( $ 19). <p> Some dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come. The delicate herb ravioli( $ 9) stuffed with basil and other herbs shimmered in a boldly flavored tomato broth. An ordinary-sounding cucumber and yogurt terrine( $ 7.50) looked like a beautiful mosaic, served with a mint pesto and a tiny terra-cotta pot that held a bouquet of glistening baby greens. <p> Few places are able to achieve such a crisp coating on sweetbreads( $ 9.75). The hot morsels made a pleasant contrast to the baby mizuna and the dressing with chopped eggs, horseradish, pickles and capers. <p> The tournedos of lamb shank( $ 19) bridged the rustic/refined gap nicely. The meat was formed into a patty and served with mushrooms and stuffed rigatoni. The rich meat -- glaze on the plate brought all the flavors together. Though it certainly was n't flashy, a guinea fowl special( $ 19) was perfection one night : Expertly roasted, it was served on a bed of spinach with tiny turnips and a light poultry sauce. <p> Desserts, under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were perplexed by some inconsistencies. One night the chilled apple soup( $ 6.50) was flawless : The broth had an intense apple flavor with only a hint of seasoning, and the apple sorbet in the center cooled and enriched the entire dish. Three translucent slices of crisp fried apples stuck in the sorbet added a dramatic look and a lovely texture to the silken blends. On another visit, however, the broth was overpowered by almond and spices, and the vanilla ice cream was a poor substitute for the fruit sorbet. <p> The tropical fruit clafouti( $ 6.50) on one visit was exceptional because of the fine dice of fruit, the buttery texture and the light pool of mango coulis underneath. Another time the pineapple dominated and seemed to interact adversely with the other ingredients, leaving an almost fishy taste in its wake. <p> Fortunately there are no complaints about the ginger citrus creme brulee( $ 6), the warm espresso pear financier( $ 6.50), served with a crunchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Marnier souffle( $ 8). <p> Still, because of the smooth service and the soothing interior featuring light-wood plantation shutters and dark upholstery on the banquettes, Chez Michel can still be an excellent dining experience. <p> CHART( 1) : <p> CHEZ MICHEL <p> ADDRESS : 804 North Point St.( at Hyde Street), San Francisco <p> PHONE :( 415) 775-7036 <p> HOURS : Open for dinner 5-10:30 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday.
