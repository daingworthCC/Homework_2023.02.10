3029241 <p> At any given point in time, Ken Schrader is apt to be doing one of two things : driving in a race or driving around looking for one. <p> The 14-year NASCAR Winston Cup veteran is a throwback to an era when drivers raced for a living and lived to race, when they were n't businessmen and corporate pitchmen and the only personal appearances that mattered came behind a steering wheel. <p> For Schrader, 43, racing is profession and hobby. The track is where he goes to work, where he goes to play, where he takes his family on vacation. He has known no other life and does n't want to. <p> Between Winston Cup races last weekend in Richmond, Va., and this weekend in Brooklyn, Mich., Schrader is touring the Midwest on his annual outing with friends. <p> " It 's just an excuse for all the boys to go on a trip, " he says. " We go playin ' every year about this time. " <p> Between rain showers, he won a modified feature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt-track race in St. Charles, Mo. The stakes will be considerably higher come Sunday at Michigan Speedway, but the rewards are substantially the same. <p> " I just love to do this, " he says. " It 's a lotta work, but I do n't think of it as work ' cause I 'm out playin '. If it was n't fun, then believe me, it would be a whole lotta work. " <p> Like any NASCAR driver, Schrader yearns to win the Daytona 500 or Brickyard 400 and end the season as Winston Cup champion. But his dreams do n't begin, or end, there. Asked what he still wants to accomplish in a career that shows four Winston Cup wins and more than $ 11 million in prize money, he grins and reaches for his briefcase. <p> Out comes a pamphlet for a dirt-track series that runs every night June 24-July 15, from Clarksville, Tenn., to West Plains, Mo., to Farmer City, Ill., to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner. <p> " Someday, I 'm gon na load up all my stuff and get all my buddies and go, " he says. " I 've hit a few of those but never all of ' em. Someday, I will. " <p> That briefcase also is home to a dogeared copy of National Speedway Directory, which lists every racetrack in the country. Schrader notes where he has competed( 39 states) and where he has won( 26). He also maintains a notebook listing all of his races by date, site, where he started and finished and how much money he won. <p> He plans to run nearly 50 races this season apart from the 33-stop Winston Cup schedule. He opened by winning the Copper World Classic in January at Phoenix and picked up a Winston West victory in May at California Speedway. <p> He recently agreed to a 10-race Grand National deal with his Winston Cup boss, Andy Petree, and will make at least one start for the NASCAR truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' there, and I do n't have to ask permission to drive one of ' em, " he says. <p> Schrader figures he 'll hit 8-10 series, including a few visits to I-55 Speedway in Pevely, Mo. He always calls ahead that he 's coming to give the local track owner a promotional boost. In the case of Pevely, he does n't have to. He owns it. <p> Schrader 's wife of 14 years, Ann, and their two young children are along for most of the ride, including the detours. " After the Brickyard 400( in Indianapolis) last year, we went to Wisconsin and Kenny raced at a dirt track that night, " Ann says. " I go with him to the extra races about 20 times a year. " <p> Schrader scoffs at suggestions that his extracurricular activities are at least partly to blame for his seven-year Winston Cup drought. He won four times in his first four seasons with owner Rick Hendrick but never returned to victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schrader joined forces with Petree to start last season. <p> " The last race I won, in ' 91 at Dover, I got home at 3:30 in the morning from a race the night before in Maine, " he says. " They did n't ask when I got home and I did n't volunteer. <p> " Look at ' 94 when I finished fourth in the Winston Cup points. I ran 104 races that year. Then I cut back the next year and finished 17th and gained 10 pounds. <p> " The point is, you can make this as time-consuming as you want or do n't want. I 'll do anything my sponsor wants me to do. But if they do n't need me and I 'm off racin ' on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, that wo n't hurt nothin '. And if we 've got an off weekend, you can sure bet I ai n't goin ' to a convention. I 'm goin ' racin '. " <p> Petree started his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dale Earnhardt, during which Earnhardt won 15 races and two championships. He quickly has become a Schrader fan. <p> " He 's the perfect driver for this team, " Petree says. " He qualifies well, he keeps the car in one piece and he 's given us a chance to build a competitive team around him. <p> " He just loves what he 's doing. I see other guys maybe a little more successful, but they do n't enjoy it nearly as much. If we 're a little down around here, he feels like it 's his responsibility to pump us up. " <p> Schrader saw another birthday go by two weeks ago and slowed down just long enough to take stock. " I thought, ' Damn, I was just a pup when I got here. What happened? ' " <p> Sounds as if time really does fly when you 're having fun. <p> THE SCHRADER FILE <p> -- Age : 43.
