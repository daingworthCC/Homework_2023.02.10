3034541 <p> They were like any other baseball fans seeing Fenway Park for the first time. <p> This was Tuesday. Paul Peake had his baseball-equipment bag slung over his shoulder as he walked underneath the stands at the famous, old ball yard. It was dark. Then, he spied the light from a tunnel leading up into the stands. <p> He walked up the tunnel into bright sunlight. And in front of him was the emerald-green grass of the outfield, the famous Green Monster wall, the Pesky pole, the smooth basepaths cut out of the perfect grass. <p> " I remember thinking ' Omigod, ' " said Peake. " It was awesome. " <p> Cormack Eklof thought it was " surreal. " <p> And Mike Kindle called it the " most extraordinary baseball experience I have ever had. " <p> But these were n't Americans talking. These were members of Ireland 's national baseball team that 's in the midst of a two-week stay in Rhode Island, playing baseball, watching baseball and learning as much as they can about it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardines Field in Newport. Friday, Lischio Field in North Kingstown. It 's all part of an Irish-American Friendship series that includes both the Irish National team and a team of Irish Little Leaguers and is being hosted by the Slocum Baseball Club of North Kingstown. <p> Two years ago, the Slocum Club sent a team to Ireland that put the exchange in motion. <p> " It 's incredible how much the Irish kids have improved in two years, " Ed Cooney, manager of the Slocum Club, was saying yesterday. " They 're 50-percent better. Better hitting. Better throwing. Better instincts. " <p> Irish baseball? In Ireland, the top sports are soccer, Gaelic football, and their national sport of hurling. But now, they 're doing another kind of hurling. Hurling a baseball. <p> How did this happen? It began in 1998 when Peter O'Malley, then owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, donated a major league field and a Little League field in West Dublin. Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speidel and a baseball aficionado, happened to the see a notice in a national magazine. Cooney and his son, Ed Jr., also happened to be leaving for Ireland on a golfing trip. <p> " We looked for the field when we were in Dublin but all we got was a lot of blank stares when we asked about it, " he remembers. " When I got back home, I called the Dodgers. They put me in touch with the Irish baseball people and that 's how the series started. " <p> It 's not as if Irish athletes did n't know about baseball. <p> " It 's just that they did n't know very much, " said Mike Kindle, manager of the Irish Nationals. " They know about caps. They all wear baseball caps, Red Sox caps, Yankee caps or Cub caps. Just about everyone in Ireland has a relative in the United States, mostly in the Irish-American hotbeds of Boston, New York or Chicago. So, they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal <p> The NCAA does n't mind if college football teams have preseason " conditioning " workouts. Just do n't let the coaches attend. Because they might cheat, you know, and start running plays and having scripted practices. <p> Whatever happens, do n't let the 12 or so people in every program who know these players best be around to help see to it that they are safe. <p> This all seems, at a time when players are dying from heatstroke and other causes in numbers much higher than ever before, that NCAA rules place a higher priority on stopping cheating than keeping players alive. <p> Have we heard much from the NCAA in the wake of the deaths of three college football players -- Rashidi Wheeler at Northwestern, Eraste Autin of Florida and Devaughn Darling of Florida State? <p> It does n't seem like it. <p> We heard much more from the NCAA when some college basketball teams were going to play in a tournament at the Paris casino and hotel in Las Vegas. NCAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be played in a building where gambling was also happening. <p> So now the teams will play the tournament at a Las Vegas high school and it 's okay. That the teams will fly into an airport where there are slot machines and that they most surely will be staying at hotels where there are sports books and blackjack tables passed without comment. <p> That 's the thing. <p> When you legislate for appearances and convenience, for common sense, the rules not only do n't work, they might be harmful. <p> When you say that coaches ca n't appear at a preseason workout, you are n't stopping the workout. You are leaving it in the hands of fewer professionals. <p> According to reports, trainers and weight coaches were running those Northwestern drills when Wheeler had his fatal asthma attack because coaches are n't allowed. And according to reports from several players, Wheeler was one of four or five players who were collapsing in distress. <p> But if Northwestern Coach Randy Walker had been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Wheeler collapsed and died, had Walker seen how other players were falling, gasping for air, maybe things would have been different. Maybe Walker, together with the trainer, would have stopped things. <p> -- Diane Pucin <p> Los Angeles Times <p> Aaron Gibson weighed 405 pounds when the new front office and coaching regime took over the Detroit Lions last winter. The offensive tackle from Wisconsin weighed closer to 380 in training camp this week, but he was n't practicing. Another shoulder injury. They say it is separate from and not as threatening as the surgeries he has endured the last two years on both shoulders. <p> Linemate Stockar McDougle, a mere 375, was n't practicing either, causing new Lions boss Matt Millen to voice concern about football players who are " fat and lazy, a bad combination. " Millen quickly added how talented both Gibson and McDougle are. He could have added they are two of the most talented 400-pound athletes he has ever seen. <p> At 405, Gibson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than William " the Refrigerator " Perry weighed( or was listed as weighing) when he looked so huge playing in the Bears ' defensive line just 15 years ago. <p> As Perry once said, " I was big when I was little. " <p> Gibson has a big little brother, Adam, who is in high school in Bloomington, Ind. <p> " He 's bigger than me, " Gibson said. " About 410, maybe. " <p> With McDougle as a teammate and NFL players everywhere expanding, Gibson feels more and more at home. <p> " It 's changed, " he said. " I was probably the first 400-pounder. It 's kind of good to see now that I 'm down to 370 or 380, people are coming up to that and still being athletic. " <p> Football likes big men and vice versa. Football even likes fat and lazy men if they can play football. Maybe it does n't make a lot of nutritional sense to weigh 400 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to play football, either, or race cars, or climb mountains, or trade commodities. Risk is part of the reward, a big part. <p> In the week since Minnesota Vikings tackle Korey Stringer died of heatstroke, there has been a lot of talk about what the NFL is going to do in the future to prevent a recurrence. The answer is pretty much what it did for the last 80 years, when no one died. <p> Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was asked whether the NFL would consider imposing standards for working conditions in heat. <p> " Oftentimes, standards and practices developed for general use do n't have too much application to the NFL because we are dealing with elite athletes, " Tagliabue said. <p> Gibson plays the same position Stringer played. <p> " That did affect me, " Gibson said. " He was one of the guys I looked up to from the beginning. It 's something you ca n't think about or worry about. You push yourself. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always will. <p> -- Don Pierson <p> Chicago Tribune
