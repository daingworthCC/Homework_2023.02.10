3064641 <p> TORINO, Italy -- Now that the 2006 Winter Olympics are just three months away, curiosity 's swelling about the little-known Italian metropolis that will host 17 days of high-profile competition. To this point, most Americans know Torino( called Turin by English speakers) solely for housing the shroud reputed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. But as the setting for February 's Games, this city of nearly 1 million will grab center stage not just with winter sports fans but with chocoholics, cafe lovers, art buffs and fine cuisine followers from around the globe. <p> The regal Baroque palazzos and churches and centuries-old porticos give Torino an elegant, Old World feel. But at the same time, the city 's got a palpable, yet understated, modern intellectual buzz. That 's thanks to the swarms of university students stalking its streets and holding court day and night in its legendary cafes and riverside bars. Moving through town, you feel the juxtaposition between what 's old and new, a place where grand old piazzas and sleek new glass-and-steel sports arenas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all feels right. <p> A hidden gem among Italian cities, underrated Torino -- which lies between the Po River and the western Alps in the Piedmont region -- is a stepchild on the travel circuit, as flashier Rome, Florence and Venice earn the headlines and tourist spending. But that low profile will change once Olympics watchers catch glimpses of this architecturally grand city, whether on TV or when they arrive here for the Games. Thanks to the upcoming Olympics, Torino 's been hastily transforming itself from an industrial haven that spawned the revered Fiat automobile into a tourist-friendly spot for the 1 million spectators, 10,000 accredited journalists and 2,500 athletes expected here. <p> Among the improvements promised by the start of the Games : 2,500 new hotel rooms in the city and scattered throughout the mountains( a 30 percent boost from current capacity), a 5oe-mile underground and automated transport system, and a host of sports arenas that, once the Games are through, will house Torino 's ice sports and trade show exhibitions. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of European sports, home to the madly popular and successful Juventus team of Italy 's soccer league. <p> Although competitions for sports like Alpine skiing, snowboarding and freestyle will be staged in nearby mountain towns Sestriere, Bardonecchia, and Sauze d'Oulx( www.montagnedoc.it) and a network of shuttle buses, trains and trams will transport fans between sites, Torino has saved some of the Olympics ' highest-profile events for its own front yard. One of the three Olympic Villages will be housed here and the opening and closing ceremonies also will be staged in town. And competitions for figure skating, always the glamor sport of the Winter Games, will take place in the remodeled Palavela, a structure built in 1961 to celebrate Italy 's first century as a unified nation but redesigned by renowned architect Gae Aulenti. <p> Sure, these games are about sport, but during a late October news conference in New York City, officials from the Olympic Games ' organizing committee and Torino itself stressed how showcasing " culture " is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a city with a rich history, enviable Baroque architecture -- and more recently, it 's become a destination for art of the contemporary and cinematic kind. <p> Already, the city 's promoting itself as a weekend destination with French, German, Swiss and northern European tourists, accessible by low-cost flights from cities like Paris. Even taxis here are gearing up for the Games, their back seat pockets offering brochures for riders to take. And since it 's little-known by even savvy world travelers, the city will soon find itself on a global stage and on the receiving end of more publicity than it 's ever seen. <p> " We are convinced that the Olympics will be, above all, a media event, and that our city will be viewed more through the TV than in person, " says Livio Besso Cordero, chairman of Turismo Torino, the city 's tourist board. " Precisely for this reason, we have thought of various means through which Turin can be better known and appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its charm is by using its diverse piazzas, or public squares, as settings for key Olympic events. For example, the city 's enormous Piazza Castello, with the Royal Palace as a backdrop, will serve as " Medal Plaza " for the Games. Each night after the awards ceremonies, this piazza will host cultural events to help focus attention on the aesthetic offerings of this cosmopolitan city, giving visitors and billions of TV viewers alike an authentic glimpse of this city 's life. <p> But while world-class athletes vie for medals on the Alpine slopes and inside sports venues, culture, arts and cuisine enthusiasts will drink in the Torinese lifestyle. And what a delicious one it is. You wo n't find the animated characters you 'd spot in Rome or the all-business, all-the-time vibe you get in style-obsessed Milan. The Torinesi are known for their strong work ethic -- they are northern Italians, after all -- but they also revere playtime. So much so that they 've elevated it to an art form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin to the American happy hour. <p> Urbanites from around the world will feel right at home in Torino, a city of scenic neighborhoods with strong characters all their own. Here are some suggestions for experiencing la dolce vita in Torino when it comes to dining, drinking, museum-hopping and hotel shopping throughout the city : <p> Dining, drinking with class : The Torinesi savor cocktails and full appetizer spreads in trendy bars on Piazza Vittorio Veneto and in historic cafes after work and before late dinners. Vermouth was born here in the 18th century, along with the trademark Martini( diehards can visit the Martini Museum of the History of Enology in the countryside toward the town of Asti). And as is true throughout Italy, food and wine are sacred here -- after all, this region is home to the global Slow Food movement. Pasta dishes adorned with regionally grown truffles are popular, as are Piemontese wines like full-bodied aged Barolo or Barbaresco. <p> The city 's full of small culinary gems like Le Vitel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from Piazza Castello and shop-filled Via Po. With just eight tables, it 's a cozy spot( whose name translates loosely to " the astonished veal " in French) that woos locals as well as British, Spanish and French tourists. Although it features traditional regional dishes such as vitello tonnato( whipped mayonnaise, tuna and capers served over slices of cold roast veal) and cod with fresh tomatoes and capers, this friendly spot is a don't-miss because of its 18th century wine cellar. Formerly part of the Italian royal family 's underground cellar network, Le Vitel Etonne 's cellar features 500 all-Italian wines. And it 's interactive : Guests can descend the spiral staircase and choose which bottle they 'll sip with lunch or dinner. <p> The sophisticated sweet life reigns in this formerly royal city of Baroque castles and Old World cafes. Do as the locals have been doing since the 1800s and during the frosty winter months drop into a warm historic spot like Caffe San Carlo( www.caffesancarlo.it) for bicerin, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh milk that 's layered into elegant small glasses and topped with whipped cream. The dark stuff is a work of art here, as cioccolato earns its own March festival, with family-run shops throughout Torino and Piedmont celebrating the region 's chocolate obsession. Compulsive tasters can pick up a ChocoPass, which offers 10 samplings in 24 hours( $11.80) or 15 samplings( $17.70) of everything from pralines to gianduiotti( a blend of cocoa, sugar and hazelnuts) over a two-day period. They 're for sale at Turismo Torino " Information Points " at the airport, Porta Nuova train station and the centrally located Piazza Solferino. <p> Culture reigns supreme : With more than 40 museums, Torino is home to the famed Museo Egizio, with the second-most extensive collection of Egyptian art outside of Cairo. And the Museum of the Holy Shroud( www.sindone.org) offers the faithful a glimpse into the history of this venerated linen through guided tours.( The original shroud is not on display here, but is kept at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torino on the cinematic map is the Museo Nazionale del Cinema( **30;2002;TOOLONG), housed inside the landmark Mole Antonelliana. The five-floor interactive, vertical museum gives buffs a place to view films and check out props ranging from Charlie Chaplin 's bowler to Rudolph Valentino costumes. The elevator ride to the top of the Mole offers unparalleled panoramic views of the city. <p> Shopping is a dignified affair here, with tony boutiques and stores housed along Via Roma( where you 'll find names like Salvatore Ferragamo and Hermes) and Via Po under elegant covered porticos -- built way back in the 16th century, no less -- that keep the elements away from those indulging in retail therapy. Outlet shopping diehards who want to see how much they can save on Prada, La Perla and Roberto Cavalli items in their native Italy can travel to the 150-store McArthur Glen Serravalle mall near the town of Asti. It 's about a two-hour drive from Torino or a 1oe-hour train ride from Torino 's Porta Nuova station. <p> Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out spots like La Drogheria for aperitivi. After 7 p.m., this place on Piazza Vittorio Veneto buzzes with young hipsters grazing at its generous buffet spread and kicking back on its mismatched sofas, chairs and stools. Stroll along to others under the piazza 's porticos for a change of pace -- and crowd. Or head over to the gentrified Quadrilatero Romano district, a terribly hip ' hood in the historically Roman part of town filled with open-late wine bars, eateries and boutiques as sleek and chic as any you 'll find in New York or San Francisco. <p> And although it 's too cold to lounge outdoors, watch for nighttime action at the Murazzi, a paved stretch along the Po River that houses many of Torino 's late-night clubs, such as The Beach. The brick-walled riverside club offers hip, young Torinesi a place to alternately get their grooves on or just chill. <p> Sleeping in style : Boutique properties like the 90-room, four-star Hotel Boston( www.hotelbostontorino.it) offer visitors a SoHo vibe, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms. And in Quadrilatero Romano, there 's AB+( www.progettocluster.com), a restored medieval building stands that houses three luxury apartments that money-is-no-object guests can rent. And when they 're ready to venture out, the complex 's Mediterranean-inspired restaurant is downstairs, as is the cavelike high-tech club that hosts DJ sets and live entertainment. <p> Visitors longing to be close to the city 's Olympic action might choose one of two Le Meridien properties( **26;2034;TOOLONG). Designed by famed architect Renzo Piano( the mastermind behind the Art Institute of Chicago 's new north wing) and housed in part of Fiat 's former factory, the Le Meridien Lingotto is a stylish four-star hotel that draws a business crowd. But trend followers will lust for Le Meridien Art+Tech, a five-star, 142-room wing of the Lingotto hotel. Art+Tech is all about glass design and speed, and like its sister property offers incredible views of the surrounding Alps. Speedskating fans wo n't have far to go to reach the Lingotto Oval, the newly built multiuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torino Olympic Village, a home-away-from-home for the Games ' athletes and staff. <p> The Winter Olympics are around the corner, but competition tickets are still on sale at **26;2062;TOOLONG.
