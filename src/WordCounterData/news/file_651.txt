Stacy Howard, a spokeswoman for Seattle Public Schools, did not return phone calls Monday seeking information about Cunningham 's status in the school district. <p> Just before 11 p.m. Wednesday, sheriff 's deputies responded to a report of gunfire at a condominium complex at 615 S.W. Ambaum Blvd., where they found Voegele in a stairwell, dead from a gunshot wound to the head, charging papers say. <p> Cunningham approached deputies at the scene, said he had been staying at the complex with his aunt and was with Voegele when she was shot, say the charges. <p> According to Cunningham 's version of events, the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a black BMW fired at Cunningham as the teen opened a door to get some fresh air, say the charges. <p> But a male resident told detectives he was getting ready for bed and heard voices in the hall outside his unit, say the charges.

Cunningham then ran outside and the resident heard two more shots, say the papers. <p> Senior Deputy Prosecutor John Castleton wrote in charging papers that Cunningham exhibited a " complete lack of remorse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making deputies and witnesses believe he was the " true target of this fictitious drive-by shooting.
