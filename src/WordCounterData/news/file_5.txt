3001041 <p> One jump on a practice rink changed the face of the United States figure skating team Sunday, ushering 17-year-old Emily Hughes into the Olympics. She will replace Michelle Kwan, who was forced to pull out with a groin injury, leaving Sasha Cohen as the only realistic candidate to uphold the United States ' medal hopes. <p> When 25-year-old Kwan told skating officials here early Sunday that she would have to withdraw, ending her last hopes for a gold medal, Hughes and her family were eating a sushi dinner Saturday night at Daruma of Tokyo, her favorite Japanese restaurant, near their home in Great Neck, N.Y. <p> It was the same restaurant where Emily 's older sister Sarah first met Kwan -- and got her autograph -- after Kwan performed at Nassau Coliseum some seven years ago. The restaurant 's menu now lists a Sarah Gold Roll, which honors the surprise gold medal Sarah won in Salt Lake City in 2002. Kwan finished a disappointing third four years ago, after winning silver in 1998. <p> Kwan said Saturday that she was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's father, John Hughes, the caller ID gave away that it was from United States Figure Skating Association officials. He announced that bit of news to the table before answering. After a brief conversation, he gave the thumbs-up sign and passed the phone to Emily. <p> The Hugheses were asked not to say anything for 12 hours. <p> " They told us we could n't tell anyone, so we had to leave the restaurant, " Hughes said via conference call from her home. " It 's a little hard to be quiet because we were so excited. " <p> Alongside Emily at dinner were Sarah, John and Amy Hughes as well as Emily 's agent, Art Kaminsky, and his wife. On their way out, Kaminsky said they stopped briefly to look at a television showing the start of the pairs short program, which kicked off Olympic figure skating Saturday. <p> Back in Turin, Kwan 's withdrawal began what turned into a disappointing day for the United States. The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the men 's halfpipe but did not win a medal in the men 's downhill, short-track speedskating or the men 's luge singles. Its total of three medals after two days of competition matched the total in Salt Lake City. <p> Kwan arrived here full of hope that she could compete for the gold medal that was missing from her Olympic career. A previous groin injury had put that in doubt, forcing her to withdraw from the national championships in January. She was named to the Olympic team after petitioning for a spot, then proving that she was healthy by performing for skating officials about two weeks ago. <p> But in her first practice here, Kwan landed badly while attempting a triple flip and United States team doctors said she pulled a groin muscle. This one ended her Olympic career. <p> Kwan tried to hold back tears during her news conference, but halfway through, she cried. <p> " I 've learned it 's not about the gold, " Kwan said. " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets. I tried my hardest and if I do n't win the gold, it 's O.K. I 'll be happy. " <p> NBC was excited enough about another Hughes in the Olympics to have a camera crew at her house early Sunday morning in the middle of a snowstorm. <p> Hughes remained grounded in Long Island because of the snow, but she said there was no rush to get to Turin because the short program is not until Feb. 21. In fact, Kaminsky said, Emily would probably attend school as usual Monday, if it is not canceled because of the weather. <p> Emily is a much longer shot to win a medal than her sister was. The most obvious point of comparison is that Sarah finished third at the national championships in 2002 before winning the gold at Salt Lake City ; Emily finished third at the nationals last month before temporarily losing her spot on the Olympic team to Kwan. <p> But the program Sarah performed in Salt Lake City was more difficult than Cohen 's or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slutskaya won the silver and Cohen place fourth in 2002.) The level of difficulty in Emily 's program this year does not approach Cohen 's. <p> At her best, particularly under the new scoring system -- which leaves much less room for discretion on the technical side -- Hughes could contend for a spot in the top 10. It is her first season competing on the senior level. <p> At nationals, Hughes fell attempting a triple jump and completed only four in her long program. The top skaters often land as many as seven, some in combination with double or triple jumps. The third member of the United States team, 16-year-old Kimmie Meissner, completed seven triples in her performance at the nationals, but still finished far behind Cohen when the points were totaled. <p> " At nationals, when I finished third and made the world championships team, I was just so excited with that because it was such a big step up from last year, " Hughes said. " For me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dream so far. " <p> But the skater who now has a chance to step out of Kwan 's considerable shadow is Cohen, who enters her second Olympics as a medal contender. At last year 's world championships, Cohen finished second to Slutskaya, who is the favorite here. <p> Cohen reacted graciously to Kwan 's withdrawal. " I was a little bit shocked, " she said. " I know how tough it is to come back from an injury. It 's great that she tried and I 'm sorry that it did n't work out. " <p> Cohen, 21, skated a flawless short program in Salt Lake City, only to fall doing a triple-triple combination in the long program. <p> Kwan 's disappointment in 2002 was even more acute. She was the favorite, but fell in her long program and finished third. It was the second straight Games in which she failed to come through with the gold. In 1998, she finished second to another teenager from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying for a third Olympics. At last year 's world championships, she finished fourth in her first exposure to the new scoring system, which puts a premium on the kind of difficult elements she was not doing. <p> Her intensified efforts to add those elements, Kwan said, led to her injury-plagued season. A hip injury knocked her out of several international competitions and the Grand Prix series. A groin injury in December kept her from the nationals, an event she had won a record-tying nine times. <p> To petition successfully onto the Olympic team, Kwan had to skate her short and long programs for a team of observers Jan. 27 at a rink in Artesia, Calif. She performed so well that Bob Horen, chairman of the United States Figure Skating Association 's international committee, said he believed Kwan could win the gold. <p> But those hopes crashed during Kwan 's first practice in Turin. When she was forced to withdraw, Kwan advised Hughes not to forget to enjoy herself. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I 'm sure she 'll have a great time and I 'm sure she 'll make the country proud. " <p> Kwan said she would head home immediately. " I do n't want to be a distraction, " she said. With that, she left the Olympic stage to Cohen and Hughes. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com A pulled groin muscle forced Michelle Kwan to withdraw from the Olympics.( Photo by Jeremiah Bogert/The New York Times)( pg.
