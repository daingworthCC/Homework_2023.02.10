3064741 <p> Twenty-five years ago, one girl was arrested for every 10 boys charged with the crime of assault. Today, it 's one girl for every four boys. Local cases of violent femmes include the notorious Glenbrook North hazing three years ago and a girl gang at Chicago 's Dyett Academic Center two years ago. <p> In video games, on the big screen in movies from " Mean Girls " to " Mr. and Mrs. Smith " -- even in cartoons on TV, more and more female characters are getting in their licks. In " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, " even super-student Hermione Granger puts up her dukes. <p> A new book out Thursday says the increase in girls ' violence is a byproduct of many interrelated cultural trends, some good, some bad. James Garbarino, author of See Jane Hit, Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About It( Penguin, $25.95), talked with the Sun-Times last week. <p> Garbarino, former president of the Chicago-based Erikson Institute for Advanced Study in Child Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on children and has written seven books on the subject. He left Erikson in 1994 to teach human development and co-direct the Family Life Development Center at Cornell University. Last fall he joined Loyola University 's psychology department, holding the Maude C. Clarke Chair in humanistic psychology. <p> Q. Is violence the new frontier for girls? Will they catch up with boys? <p> A. Like a lot of things in retrospect, it seems we should have seen it coming. But we still instinctively cling to the idea that you can make one change in one domain( the workplace, opportunities in sports) without having it spill over into others. Here, the strongly held belief that females have a nature that is sort of immutable was used to justify a lot of patriarchial policies and programs and structures in the name of " protecting " women. But on the other side, there is the idea that this " feminine nature " would make certain things incompatible.... I do n't think it 's ever going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace and on the playing field, now comes greater equality in violence. <p> A. There may well be a generational/historical thing going on where a... generation of girls/women come through the process and end up with one foot in each world. They retain the best of feminine culture and add on assertiveness in the workplace and become particularly successful. The question is whether the generation coming up is sort of losing track of the feminist foothold and looking more like men in terms of aggression. <p> Q. You say : " We may be witnessing a tipping point in the changing nature of physical aggression in American girls. " Please explain. <p> A. One place where women have been violent and aggressive is in the family. Women have been killing children and husbands for a long time. The real change is the projection into the social environment outside of the family. Now more and more they are both doing it and being represented doing it in settings beyond the family. When you get an accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is containable. But at some point the interaction changes and escalates very quickly. It seems we are in the ' escalating very quickly ' stage. <p> Q. You blame part of the trend on television shows, movies, video games and music videos that bombard girls with images of aggressive and/or violent femmes. <p> A. When you see these movies, the way the audience responds is also part of the message. The response becomes part of how kids interpret it. In the case of Hermione in " Harry Potter, " everyone claps when she punches out Malfoy. If you are uncertain about what you are supposed to think, the audience response will tell you. Kids are very susceptible to that sort of interpretation. All the evidence says each bit of desensitization increases the risk of aggressive behavior. Every time a movie succeeds with a violent female character, they will market more of these kinds of movies and each one becomes more validating. The sequels become more violent as you have to ratchet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the link between early sexualization and violence? <p> A. There are at least a couple of things going on. Sex as power has a long history, of course, but it has typically been men with a blunt exercise of power vs. women who exercise a more indirect use of sex as power. I think we are seeing more girls being drawn to a more masculine approach to sex as power. It is n't indirect or flirting or coquettish. It 's overt in a sort of unabashed way. That, too, the media feeds. Aggressive men have been portrayed as very sexy for a long time. This is new and escalating -- the portrayal of very aggressive women as very sexual and provocative as well. <p> Q.What do girls not know about aggression that boys know? <p> A. If you watch teenage girls in bunches you will see a lot more light-hearted physical aggression. Some of that is good. One thing that people respond to and like about boys is they crash around, knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sort of endearing in a way. Some of that is good for girls. The danger for boys is someone will miss a social cue. One minute they are playfully roughhousing and some line is crossed and someone really hits back with intent to hurt. Boys get a lot of training and experience, I make reference to fathers wrestling with sons. If you do n't have that socialization, it makes it more likely that aggression will get out of hand. For boys, aggression does not terminate friendships. For girls, it does terminate friendships. <p> Q. Are the classic " girl " moves still in play -- the cold shoulder, silent treatment, talking behind each other 's backs? <p> A. When girls want to hurt each other, they do so by manipulating relationships. Some teasing bonds kids, some seeks to isolate and humiliate. Classic girl moves? I think they are still in play, but when you pair it with the overt sexualization and lack of verbal boundaries, the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ' and ' you 're a bitch. ' <p> Q. You list four kinds of psychological aggression that girls employ : rejection, terrorizing( bullying), isolating( cutting off from peer relationships) and corrupting( picking up the bad habits of others). Are these new? <p> A. If there 's a change, it 's in the intensity of the tactics. The whole cyberbullying thing where they start on the Internet calling girls names. That has an effect of its own. That 's one reason adults need to maintain very high standards of language for and with kids, because the more you let them slip, the more you open the door to the next level of aggression. <p> Q.You say that such cultural influences as media, aggressive language and sexually provocative dress make girls more aggressive. Does technology have an effect? <p> A. In technology, the danger is isolation. Not just a generic isolation. It 's equally or more important that they are isolated from pro-social support systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support systems they have validate their negative behavior. The analogy here is one of the great dangers of this technological age is it leads to fragmentation more than isolation. So sitting at the computer has the effect of isolating you from the society, but also fragmenting the society and the authority of the society. That increases the gulf between your fragment and other fragments. <p> Q. What can we do to counteract aggression? <p> A. We need more connections and peace-building programs. We need to build community among people who have fragmenting experiences. Parents need to recognize that in the past, socialization away from aggression for girls was on remote control. Now we have to provide girls with experiences that allow them to manage aggression. <p> Q. Which girls are you most concerned about? <p> A. If we look at which boys are at greatest risk for violence, it 's boys who early in life start to manifest a coherent pattern of aggressive behavior. That 's the group that costs everyone the most money and heartache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8, behavior is so malleable. School age is when we start seeing kids headed in this direction, and there is still the opportunity to redirect them. <p> Q. Is a spiritual crisis part of the trend? <p> A. I 've interviewed a lot of kids on Death Row and the single most striking thing among them is a sense of spiritual emptiness. I feel that one of the most important anchors any kid can have to deal with the toxicity of culture is to be rooted in a sense of connection beyond the material reality of the world -- commiting to a loving ethic regardless of which culture you are in or which culture you come from. Without it, that 's when I think you 're defenseless. External forces are powerful, but the spiritual path is full enough to stand up against it, whether redemptive or preventive. <p> lbaldacci@suntimes.com <p> MEET THE AUTHOR <p> Garbarino will lecture and sign books at 5 p.m. Thursday at Loyola University 's Lewis Library, 25 E.
