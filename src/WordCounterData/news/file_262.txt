3047341 <p> 3 WHEN Audrey Hepburn died of colon cancer last month at age 63, it seemed as if some cackling ogre had overturned the coach in which Cinderella was riding to the ball, and then had fled into the night carrying her glass slippers. <p> From the start, the life of the Brussels- born actress had possessed the ingredients of a fairy tale. She grew up the daughter of a Dutch noblewoman and British banker as Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston. By the time she was 20, the doe-eyed Hepburn, with the slim figure of a ballerina, already had starred in a British musical, " High Button Shoes, " appeared in a few music hall revues, and was learning ballet and modeling. <p> In 1951 the ingenue with high-sculptured cheekbones was making a now-forgotten French movie in Monte Carlo 's Hotel de Paris, " Monte Carlo Baby, " when the invalid novelist Colette chanced to see her and insisted she be cast as the lead in " Gigi, " a new play Anita Loos was adapting from one of Colette 's novels. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist that it was a foolish notion( " I 'm sorry, madame, but I ca n't act "), she nevertheless took a crash course in acting and made it to Broadway to star in " Gigi. " <p> That hit comedy, about a Parisian teenager being manipulated by her guardians so they can get rich while she loses her virginity to a " gentleman, " made Hepburn the proverbial overnight star, her image that of a sweet, naive, pixieish 16-year-old. " Being a star does n't make you feel any differently, " she said in 1951 at the height of her newfound fame. <p> The theater scene treated her like a princess, an image that she was soon to assume in her first Hollywood movie, " Roman Holiday, " portraying a runaway royal in search of a secret weekend of fun and romance. <p> The Hollywood film career that followed " Gigi " was never a prolific one -- she made 26 films in all, and appeared in one more hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the chic, well-dressed princess image that she would retain all her life. <p> Elegant, wistful, glamorous and poised, and always gracious and modest to the point of playing down her triumphs, Hepburn became the classiest act in movie land, with that wonderful slender neck and those beautiful, expressive eyes that said more than all the dialogue in all her movies. <p> How that screen image developed over the years currently can be traced in " The Audrey Hepburn Film Festival " at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto. Eighteen of her 26 movies have been scheduled during the five- week festival, and the entire box office is being donated to UNICEF, the organization to which Hepburn devoted herself as a goodwill ambassador in the last years of her life. <p>( Her decision to help the underprivileged stemmed from her own childhood suffering from malnutrition and acute anemia under Nazi occupation in the Netherlands, when she had to give up her ballet classes " because we were so short of food that I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationed to a half-loaf of bread, made of brown beans and husk, and a pound of potatoes a week. ") <p> Today through Wednesday, the Stanford Theater is double-billing " Funny Face "( 1968), a stylized musical-comedy in which Hepburn portrays a " youthful intellect " who is molded into a fashion model by dancing photographer Fred Astaire, with one of the actress ' all-time favorites, " Breakfast at Tiffany 's "( 1961). In this Blake Edwards adaptation of the Truman Capote story, Hepburn is the unforgettable Holly Golightly( she was nominated for an Oscar), a small- town girl who lives it up in New York as an escort to George Peppard. Hepburn was married to actor Mel Ferrer from 1955 to 1968 and starred with him in " War and Peace, " the 1956 version directed by King Vidor, to be screened Thursday and Friday at the Stanford. <p> In this episodic 3 1/2-hour VistaVision epic, Hepburn has the pivotal role of Natasha, and Ferrer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beloved films remains " Roman Holiday "( 1953), directed by William Wyler, for which she won her only Academy Award. It 's a charming romance- comedy in which Hepburn, as a lonely princess, runs away for a secret weekend of fun and love with newspaperman Gregory Peck. " Holiday " will be shown Saturday through March 3 with the seldom-seen " The Secret People "( 1952). Hepburn plays one of two sisters who gets involved with a gang of terrorists and has an opportunity to show off her talents as a ballet dancer. <p> March 4 features two of her lesser- known works. " Green Mansions "( 1959) is an almost lost film, an anomaly in her career. She portrays Rima, the bird girl of the Amazon, who, according to legend, is like a jungle flower and will " bloom " again even after death. Her co-stars in this confusing but beautifully photographed film( made in Venezuela) are Anthony Perkins, Lee J. Cobb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " The Children 's Hour "( 1962), based on the play " These Three " by Lillian Hellman. In this, her third film with director Wyler, Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine portray teachers in a school for girls whose lives are ruined by innuendos and rumors of a suspected lesbian relationship. <p> On March 5-9, Hepburn stars in " Sabrina "( 1954), Billy Wilder 's unusually cast comedy in which she plays a chauffeur 's daughter -- a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. She 's wooed by a much older Humphrey Bogart, who wants to keep her away from his philandering playboy brother( William Holden). Co-feature is another Wilder picture, " Love in the Afternoon "( 1957), and it, too, casts Hepburn against an older leading man : Gary Cooper, an entrepreneur who just happens to be under investigation by her father, a private detective played by Maurice Chevalier. Hepburn is charming and amusing as a cello student who gradually falls for Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Million "( 1966), her second go-around with Wyler, and an example of the caper movies that were popular during the 1960s. Hepburn is the daughter of a lovable art forger and joins with Peter O'Toole to steal a statue from a well-guarded Paris art museum. Co- feature is " Paris When It Sizzles "( 1964), in which William Holden plays a screenwriter who acts out the scenes from his script all over the city with assistant Hepburn. <p> Although she was nominated for, but did n't win, the Oscar for " The Nun 's Story "( 1959), she was voted best actress by the New York Film Critics. In this Fred Zinnemann classic, a major box-office hit in its day, she portrays a woman of the cloth whose religious loyalties are torn at every turn when she 's serving in the Belgian Congo. It is one of her most demanding roles, and she rises supremely to the challenge. <p> " The Nun 's Story " will show March 12-16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), a western that was controversial at the time of its release because she played a half-breed Indian living as a white woman with a frontier family. When her heritage is revealed, the truth creates waves of racism and a major battle with a neighboring tribe. She is supported by Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford and Audie Murphy. <p> March 17-18 offers the co-bill " Two for the Road "( 1967), Stanley Donan 's droll comedy about a vacationing couple( Hepburn and Albert Finney) whose stormy marriage is recalled in flashbacks while they are on the road, and " They All Laughed "( 1981). This is Peter Bogdanovich 's portrait of four private detectives and their love lives. <p> There will be just one film March 19-24 : " My Fair Lady "( 1964), based on the Broadway musical. Hepburn plays Eliza Doolittle, a role that Julie Andrews had created onstage -- perhaps the reason the Academy ignored Hepburn, otherwise naming the film best picture. She is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The festival wraps up March 25-26 with two thrillers. " Charade "( 1963) teams Hepburn with Cary Grant in a Parisian mystery with Hitchcockian touches. She 's searching for her deceased husband 's fortune -- $ 250,000 in gold stolen during World War II -- and is pursued by bad guys James Coburn and George Kennedy. In " Wait Until Dark "( 1967), Hepburn got another Oscar nomination, for her role of a blind woman trapped in her apartment with killers searching for a cache of hidden drugs. This was the last film she made before retiring. She came back sporadically, notably in 1976 's " Robin and Marian, " but her major period as a star was over.
