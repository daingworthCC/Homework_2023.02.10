4129141 Like the last huge PBS success teeming with great rooms and the vagaries of the British class system -- " Brideshead Revisited " in 1982 -- " Downton Abbey " features a magnificent house that influences the destinies of every character. Their roles, aristocrat or servant, are played out in the rooms where they live -- " upstairs " boudoirs and opulent sitting rooms or " downstairs " scullery, pantries and starkly furnished bedrooms. American fans will be able to imitate this marvelously styled fantasy of British life when a company called Knockout Licensing partners with brands that seek to replicate to look of " Downton " in North America : bedding and bath, home furnishings and decor, housewares, kitchenware and apparel. Who knows what Knockout 's partners will offer? Perhaps replicas of hunting prints, worn Oriental rugs, faded cabbage-rose chintzes, Staffordshire dogs, Blue Willow china and leather-bound books -- the tried-and-true elements of English country house design. These details can be lovely, even in an American house with a two-door garage and the total square footage of the drawing room and dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As viewers, it is hard not to want a bit of the glamour of the aristocrats and the drama of the servants to rub off on us. We hanker for a change from the relentlessly casual style of America, where entertaining often means little more than a flaming fire pit on the patio and plenty of craft beer on hand( not that that is n't fun, too). So why not incorporate a touch of " Downton 's " elegance into your 21st-century life? Plan a dinner party that takes the formality quotient up a notch. If nothing else, the preparations can help pass the time until the show returns. If you have a DVR, you could have people over Sunday when Season 3 begins and have a leisurely " Downton-esque " dinner before you watch. The key to realistically adding a little " Downton " to your life is to keep the focus on the dining room, where so much of the delicious action takes place. Do n't take any of this too seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passe. But there is a way to have fun getting dressed up and putting together a well-appointed table. Your " Downton " theme can best be executed using what is called " tabletop " in interior design parlance : all the china, crystal, chargers, napkins, tablecloths, candles, centerpieces, demitasse cups and place cards that make a dining-room table look like the most delicious eye candy. Many venues offer this merchandise, from Target to furniture purveyors to linen stores. Whether channeling an " upstairs " feel or a " downstairs " look, your table will be crisp, clean and proper, and everybody who sits down for dinner will be inspired to try their hardest to be good company. So : What effect are you after? For a style that borrows from the spare black-and-white and rich brown of " Downton 's " downstairs where the servants hang out( a look that really is the most modern and comfortable in the 21st century), look at the curated collection of CuriousSofa.com. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aiming for an elegant presentation but not a table dripping with gold vermeil, elaborate china, cut crystal wineglasses and ornate silver. You are striving more for classic style : perhaps a printed invitation sent ahead to your guests, followed by a properly set table with everything in its place, white place cards, of course, and crisp pale linens with a special napkin fold and a monogram. Do n't forget lots of candlelight, and be sure to keep spouses and couples separated to encourage conversation. Most important : Present several courses. The idea is n't to let down one 's hair and relax but to make an effort to be one 's best self over a dinner that shows the hosts have made an effort as well. Carol Wallace, author of " To Marry an English Lord, " a book that " Downton " creator Julian Fellowes admits inspired him to make Lady Cora a rich American married to a British peer, said the English of the early 20th century believed in " keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole formality of the evening was something you would stick to if you possibly could, " she said, even if bank accounts shrank and new customs like the pre-dinner cocktail started to become popular in the 1920s( Season 3 covers the 1920s, so prepare to see martinis shaken, not stirred, in the drawing room.) The actual formal dinner tables at upper-class soirees in early 20th-century England were more likely to feature a somewhat pared-down look : a snowy white tablecloth, a couple of show-stopping candelabra holding fresh white candles, bone china with a simple rim of gold, and then a multitude of forks, knives and spoons laid on the table in the correct order, complemented with several stemmed wine glasses or champagne flutes. The mood was more important than the objects, although high-class Brits were as materialistic as they come. The " tabletop " was there to encourage people to make good conversation and observe the best etiquette, all in a setting that was easy on the eyes. Wallace suggests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being too slavish to food tastes of almost 100 years ago : a first course of vichyssoise, the cold cream and potato soup that has been a classic for many decades, followed by a main course of Cornish game hens( not quite as complex as pheasant but evocative of the same), with roasted root vegetables( must fit in Brussels sprouts somewhere) followed by a dessert such as the British stalwart, trifle, or the apple charlotte referenced on " Downton. "( Recipes are as close as your computer ; check out epicurious.com.) An oddity of the British table in the early decades of the 20th century was the custom of women leaving to have coffee or tea in the living room while the men stayed for port, a savory bite of something after dessert and conversation about money, politics and other forbidden topics. Although this habit flies in the face of everything American and modern, it might be fun if approached in a lighthearted way. And if you opt for the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine polished wood, know that you will be undeniably chic and ready for whatever drama transpires at your party. In the dark days of winter, a little fantasy never hurt anybody, especially if a PBS miniseries is involved. Quite right, as they say in England.

Cathy Corey has taught manners to thousands of schoolchildren, as well as college and law students, for more than 19 years through the National League of Junior Cotillions, a national franchise( though she recently sold hers). Here are her rules not to break. * Never begin the meal until everyone has been served ; the hostess will be the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half ; then a bite-size piece is again broken off, buttered and eaten. Your knife should never touch the bread, except to add the butter. * The resting position of your utensils is across the top of the plate -- do not " build a bridge " by resting knives or forks on the lip of the plate and then leaning them on the table. * Once a utensil has been used, it is never placed back on the linens. It must rest on plates or saucers. * Drinking glasses are always positioned near the top of your dinner knife. Even if you are left-handed, the glass should be placed to the right after every sip. * The dinner napkin is folded into a rectangle, resting on your lap with the fold toward your stomach. It is never tucked into one 's collar, unless one is eating lobster. * The salt and pepper shakers are always passed together, even if the request to pass was for only one of them. Like a bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take separate vacations! * The gentlemen always rises when a lady approaches or leaves the table. * One always passes to the right with one 's left hand( crossing over the front of your body), to shorten the range of motion. The person accepting the pass takes it in his/her right hand, then changes to the left hand when passing. * When finished with the meal, one should place the used napkin to the left of the place setting -- never wadded up on the top of dirty dishes.
