3057841 <p> JEFFERSON <p> West Bank toll estimated at 200 <p> An estimated 200 Jefferson Parish residents have perished in Hurricane Katrina, their bodies likely trapped in homes in the West Bank neighborhoods of Westminster and Lincolnshire where flood waters rose as high as four feet and many residents did n't have the means to evacuate, Emergency Management Director Walter Maestri said Thursday. <p> Federal and local officials are expected to begin recovering the dead in those areas, as well as in swamped portions of Old Metairie and around Airline Highway, today or Saturday while workers restore utilities so Jefferson can become a staging area for the recovery of Orleans and St. Bernard parishes, Maestri said. <p> The process, however, has been hampered by a lack of communication in storm-ravaged areas. Cell service is spotty, Parish President Aaron Broussard said, and there are too few radios and walkie-talkies to direct information to thousands of police officers and armed military personnel from around the country who are manning Jefferson streets. Satellite phones do n't work, he added. <p> " We are having a tough time getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There are very few officials still there. " <p> Parish leaders said businesses would be allowed to continue operating, despite a dusk-to-dawn curfew that went into effect at 6 p.m. Thursday. <p> Jefferson residents who choose to stay in their homes after the deadline will not be forced to leave, officials said, though they warned that lack of critical services such as power, water and sewerage would make life uncomfortable. <p> A boil-water order remained in effect. <p> Though Broussard has set a goal of Sept. 30 to have critical infrastructure restored in Jefferson, Maestri said allowing residents to return on that date could compromise efforts to relieve areas hardest-hit by Katrina. <p> " We know people want to come home, but that can interfere with the recovery process " in Orleans and St. Bernard, he said. <p> - MICHELLE KRUPA, Times-picayune <p> <p> LAFOURCHE <p> Parish takes hit from Katrina <p> Maj.

The two planned to re-marry Aug. 29 - their anniversary - but the date that now forever will be remembered for Katrina 's wrath. <p> Instead of renewing their vows, the couple fled to Texas.

The Industrial Canal is almost fully patched. <p> Frank Vojkovich, a civil engineer at the Army Corps of Engineers, says the London Avenue break should be closed by today. <p> The Corps says workers are facing a new hazard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - ASSOCIATED PRESS <p> Hospitals to move to new locations <p> Charity and University Hospitals will not reopen at their current locations in New Orleans because officials have determined that the buildings are uninhabitable. <p> Officials are discussing building a new 450-bed facility in Baton Rouge, reported WDSU 's Richard Angelico. <p> The hospitals sustained significant damage from the hurricane. The windows blew out and the rain caused heavy damage. <p> The water damage is causing mold and officials said it would be too contaminated to perform any sort of medical procedure. <p> Donald Smithburg, CEO of LSU 's Health Care Services, made the decision that those buildings are uninhabitable and there will be no effort made to reoccupy those buildings. Discussions are under way as to where the hospitals will set up in the coming days, weeks and months. <p> Smithburg said the organization 's entire objective now is to take care of the displaced patients who have been moved to Baton Rouge and other parts of the state. <p> Charity Hospital was the main trauma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotels working on re-opening doors <p> Just a few days after all remaining guests were evacuated from downtown New Orleans hotels, some of the city 's most important lodging properties already have started work on re-opening. <p> At the Hilton New Orleans Riverside, the city 's largest hotel, a forklift plowed the twisted metal pieces that had fallen from the roof of the port cochere into a big pile Wednesday, while cars marked " Hilton Recovery " moved from hotel to hotel investigating damage. <p> At the Windsor Court Hotel, another forklift carrying 2-by-4 inch lumber zipped across the luxury hotel 's round brick driveway. At the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel, a crane parked on Canal Street knocked broken glass out of window frames. <p> " We 'll be up in a couple of weeks, " said Kevin Ryan, regional vice president of operations for Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. " We want to get people back to work and make sure we rebuild the city as fast as we can. " <p> The hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been working with Entergy Corp. on getting the power turned back on at hotels. Electricity and water service will enable hotels to run their air-conditioning systems and help dry out the buildings. <p> Conditions at downtown hotels vary widely. Some, such as properties in the French Quarter, are in good shape because they did n't flood and they 're not tall enough to have sustained much wind damage. Others, such as the Hyatt Regency New Orleans and the W New Orleans hotels on Poydras Street, saw a significant number of windows blown out and those hotels may be closed for a while. <p> What happens to employees is another universal concern, Langkopp said. <p> " Our employees are scattered all over the country, " Langkopp said. " We are urging any hotel employee who has n't already done so, to please contact their employer or their employer hotel chain.

She said she hopes residents will be able to return home in two weeks. <p> The city 's governmental operations could also move to Algiers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. <p> - TIMES-PICAYUNE <p> <p> PLAQUEMINES <p> Delta parish villages just ' gone ' <p> Together with the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River combined to drown the town of Empire. Hurricane Katrina dumped walls of water from both the gulf and the river on Plaquemines Parish, a narrow strip of delta that stretches 100 miles to the gulf southeast of New Orleans. <p> Empire and 10 other towns spread over 57 miles are now under 10 feet of water. <p> " They 're gone. They do n't exist anymore, " Deputy Sheriff Arceneaux said Wednesday as he guided a Reno skiff over oil-fouled waters the only way into Empire and points south. His journey took him by his former trailer, which he could n't see because it was submerged in churning floodwaters. <p> Up and down Highway 23, the narrow ribbon of asphalt that winds through the bayous, shards of brick and frame houses litter the flat countryside. <p> Mattresses and curtains and trousers are strung in the limbs of the few surviving trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamps. Massive barges were dumped atop levees that were overwhelmed by the storm. <p> The parish issued a mandatory evacuation order two days before the hurricane, and the confirmed death toll stands at three. <p> No one knows how many people stayed behind in inaccessible villages. <p> " They 're going to be pulling out bodies up and down this whole parish, " Arceneaux said as National Guard teams farther north began searching houses, marking them with green Os if clear and red Xs if not. The stench of decay cut the air in one part of Empire, and Arceneaux hoped it was a dead animal. <p> The extensive damage has strained parish resources. Capt. Robert Cosse, the stout, gravel-voiced leader of the sheriff 's marine search and rescue team, was hollering Wednesday at law enforcement boat crews gearing up for missions. He was shorthanded ; five officers quit just after the storm. <p> " They 'd had enough they just up and left, " Cosse said. <p> In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions, he said. Virtually everyone in the parish, population 28,000, has lost something to the hurricane, said Parish President Benny Rousselle, his face chemically burned a rusty orange from oil-slicked waters blown over him during assessment trips on airboats. <p> " I 've seen a lot of grown men cry in the past few days, " said sheriff 's Lt. Steve Zegura, who lost his home in Buras, a town now underwater a few miles south of Empire. <p> He located it during a rescue mission the other day only because the street sign was poking from the water 's surface. <p> The parish towns are long and narrow, crammed between levees on either side. The hurricane breached those levees in several places, but it almost did n't matter. <p> The storm surge simply flowed over the tops of the levees, from the gulf to the west and from the river to the east. <p> Eleven towns and villages virtually disappeared from Happy Jack and Port Sulphur to Home Place and Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen, who ply the bayou and gulf for shrimp, oysters and crabs. <p> All three local seafood industries are devastated, as are the area 's orange groves. Several residents said the area had only recently recovered from the destruction of Hurricane Camille in 1969. <p> " The waters are normally green-clear, but they went tea- black and, now, milky-brown, " Martin said. " It 's toxic ; dead cows, dead horses, dead dogs, oil, chemicals. " <p> No one is allowed to visit the flooded areas, and one of Arceneaux 's primary missions Wednesday was to intercept anyone trying to slip in by boat. It is dangerous to travel through the toxic, debris-clogged waters, he said. <p> - DAVID ZUCCHINO, Los Angeles Times <p> <p> ST.

I jumped out of my roof. " <p> Kinkella 's horror story is one of the first to emerge from St. Bernard Parish, one of several coastal parishes that suffered gut-wrenching hits at the hands of Hurricane Katrina while New Orleans got much of the media attention. Estimates of the death toll in the parish ranged from 500 to 1,500. <p> " It is total devastation, " said Sgt. 1st Class James Scalla of the Ohio National Guard. " There is nothing. We are in survival mode. " <p> Raymond Theriot, a deputy sheriff in St. Bernard Parish, said the grim tally could hit 1,500. Others said 500 to 600 casualties would actually be good news compared with initial gloomy predictions. <p> On Wednesday, teams that retrieve the dead, known as DMORT - or Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team - converged on a nursing home about 20 miles southeast of Chalmette. <p> Theriot said he understood that 25 or 27 bodies were inside, apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical power. <p> Others in the nursing home, which Theriot said housed about 100 residents, were moved before Hurricane Katrina arrived. <p> " They should have gotten out earlier on, " he said. " I do n't know what the breakdown was. " <p> The problem, however, was that once flood waters started rising, the emergency preparedness and Louisiana National Guard offices flooded. <p> Patients at Chalmette Medical Center were frantically rushed to higher floors and the parish 's ambulance service was nowhere to be found. <p> " The whole parish was under water " Theriot said. <p> St. Bernard Parish, including the parish seat of Chalmette, now features endless street blocks of ruined homes, toppled power lines and the stench of oil that escaped from a ruptured storage tank and oozed through roughly 40 city blocks. <p> The disaster did not respect economic lines.

It is known for outstanding fishing, an annual spring shrimp festival and hardy residents who know how to build homes to last. <p> " These fishermen have been here for years, " Theriot said. " They know how to build houses. But they were no match for this. " <p> Parish leaders and residents alike complained that they suffered in near anonymity while most news accounts focused on New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. <p> " Everything is about New Orleans, " Kinkella said. " It is not about us at all. " <p> Theriot said police, fire and other emergency workers worked heroically and without facing post-hurricane looting. <p> " As far as civil disobedience? Nothing, absolutely nothing, " Theriot said. <p> Authorities figure that 100 or so residents remain in Chalmette, which has a population of about 35,000.

However, St. Bernard is facing serious health, disease, and contamination issues that are out of our control, " Councilman Craig Taffaro said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parish President Henry " Junior " Rodriguez and Sheriff Jack Stephens. <p> The plan would divide the parish into sectors and give residents in each section a separate time to re-enter once their respective sector is deemed safe. Taffaro said a schedule has not been completed. <p> Taffaro said returnees would be allowed to visit only for a " short duration " to check their property and retrieve personal items. That time period has not yet been determined. After, all residents would be required to leave so clean up can continue. <p> - TIMES-PICAYUNE <p> <p> ST.

" Many thousands of people will return to St. Tammany in coming hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Too, gasoline remains available only in certain areas, so returning evacuees should ensure they have an adequate fuel supply to reach home and re-exit the parish to the west or north if they can not stay at home. <p> " Much of our area, particularly in and around Slidell, remains devastated and dangerous. Although fallen trees have been cleared from most roadways, debris still lines many of our thoroughfares and residential streets. Power remains out in most of the parish. Caution must be our byword, as public safety is our goal. <p> " In addition to thousands of military troops in the parish, personnel from across the country have responded. Citizens should respect law enforcement of all stripes, regardless of their insignia or the shape of their badges. <p> " As I cautioned yesterday, many criminals will prey upon our residents in this time of disaster recovery.
