4133441 School reform : Pointing a finger at the teachers unions Re : " Face the elephant in the classroom, " Feb. 1 Perspective article. In his article, Tom Coyne walks us through a labyrinth of statistical data, steering us toward his inevitable and predictable point : the alleged failure of public education is the fault of the teachers unions and all those " bad teachers. " Lost in his diatribe is any mention of the fact that we are the only industrialized nation that tests all students, regular and special needs, and not just the college bound ones. Also not mentioned, but thoroughly implied, are his Lake Wobegone assumptions you know, that mythical Minnesota prairie town where all children are " above average. " I guess now those assumptions are being packaged under a new label : " college and career ready. " After teaching and watching our cultural decline for the last 20 years, I would not recommend anyone go into public education as a teacher, at least not in this country, until people begin to make an accurate assessment of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems. Eric J. Schmidt, Littleton * * * Tom Coyne concludes that teachers and their unions are the root causes of poor student performance in our public education system. The data he cites do not support his conclusion. Coyne cites statistics that show families with more money have students who perform better. However, teachers have no control over what goes on at home, whether it is income, homework assistance, or diet and hygiene. Coyne goes on to cite issues such as " inconsistent instructional practices, " " lack of systemic curriculum, " and " superficial coverage of a large number of standards. " Issues such as these are determined by politicians and school boards, with little or no input from teachers. It is baffling and disturbing that Coyne concludes that teachers unions are solely to blame for poor student performance, when it is our state and federal governments, school boards, and school administrators that set inconsistent and sometimes impossible standards for teachers and students. If Coyne 's non sequitur conclusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other causes of poor performance are any indication of how our public schools are run, then we are indeed in trouble. Steve Laudeman, Denver * * * Tom Coyne failed to mention the other elephant that never seems to be acknowledged. It 's easy and popular to blame the teachers when our education system is not living up to its potential. What many fail to notice, however, is that many students, in both wealthy and poor districts alike, come to school unprepared due to today 's parents not giving them proper support at home. This can be due to the single parent not having enough time or, even worse, the affluent parent not caring enough to monitor how their entitled kids are progressing. In the latter case, our teachers are now having to act as parents as well as educators, taking time away from their jobs. Dave Peregoy, Clark Better uses for Burns Park than selling it to developers Re : " A park that begs for reimagining, " Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver 's Burns Park be turned over to developers. What a great use for a park more condos and residential! While Burns Park may not be used as a gathering spot, it provides some much needed respite from the sight and sound of traffic and buildings. The sculptures have been there my whole life, and make the park unique. But Rinaldi suggests moving them to the Highlands? There are many things that could be incorporated into Burns Park without making it a profit center for corporate developers. How about a community vegetable garden or a dog park? Not every piece of green space in city limits needs to be thronged with visitors for it to provide value to the community. Kari Epstein, Denver * * * Those who drive by Burns Park daily on Leetsdale Drive on their way to work are able to see the sunsets over our mountains on the western horizon, the possibility of which is rapidly disappearing with the building boom. With much of Colorado Boulevard becoming a corridor with tall buildings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long stretch, allowing a view of blue sky and the sunrise to the east. This park was given to Denver by Harry Hoffman ; do n't let it be traded away. Stuart Cooper, Denver Why Colorado needs to relax its renewable standard Re : " Do n't hobble renewable rules, " Feb. 1 editorial. Yes, you are correct. Colorado is a leader in renewable/alternative energies. But what you fail to understand is Colorado is bigger than you realize. So many people, in their vision for our state, forget that Utah, not the Continental Divide, is our western border. The state 's first renewable energy standard set the bar high, to the point that rural Colorado is being strangled by much higher electric rates. Small business is suffering, businesses are closing, people are having to leave their homes. Western Colorado legislators have no choice but to attempt to repeal or amend Colorado 's rules. As a Western Slope small business owner, I need the hobbles removed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re : " Caught between hope and worry ; Households ' hearts, minds, votes are on radar of GOP, Dems, " Feb. 1 news story. Your Sunday Post article on the bipartisan support for middle class initiatives in the legislature did not reference Republican opposition to funding for the state 's teenage birth control program. The program was previously funded by private funds for five years and reduced the rate of teenage pregnancy by 50 percent. This program funds IUDs, which the Republicans claim are methods of abortion. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not agree with this perspective, and finds IUDs one of the most effective methods of birth control. So how does this play into funding the middle class initiatives? One of the things that keeps women from moving into the middle class or causes them to fall out of the middle class is unwanted pregnancy. Not funding this initiative is shortsighted in terms of future costs to the tax system as well. We need to be supporting proven programs to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing them back to the Dark Ages. Robin Hurley, Highlands Ranch Killing( culling?) wildlife Re : " Outlaw wildlife killing contests, " Feb. 1 Writers on the Range column. Kevin Bixby 's chilling article on the abuses of hunting in wildlife killing contests brought to mind the ever vivid memory of seeing photos of hunters standing smiling over their bleeding kill as though they had done something brilliant. There is no brilliance involved, I can assure you. You buy a gun and point it at a defenseless animal and you have your kill. Period. Would that the animal could shoot back. These killing contests are disgraceful to our notion that our wilderness and wildlife deserve to be protected for the enjoyment of all. I like my wildlife alive, and I hope that state officials read Bixby 's article with as much anger and resolve as I did and put a stop to such senseless slaughter. Susan Altenhofen, Fort Collins * * * Kevin Bixby should have done his homework before exposing his ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many rodents and predators. When any animal population gets too large, it damages its environment and often becomes diseased. As man invades these animals ' environment and destroys the natural balance of predator/prey and food supply, man has the obligation to restore some semblance of balance to the ecosystem. These " killing contests " not only save tax dollars but generate revenue in the form of licenses and fees. Otherwise we would spend public tax dollars to control those predator and rodent populations. Mark Rawlins, Westminster Biofuels, not fossil fuels Re : " The truth behind the biofuels glitz, " Feb. 2 editorial. The World Resources Institute report upon which The Post depended for its editorial is deeply flawed and ignores the dangerous reality that we are increasingly dependent not just on fossil fuels in the transportation sector but on some of the dirtiest, most carbon intensive fossil fuels such as shale oil. The only way to get greenhouse gas emissions in check is to stop taking carbon out of the ground in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness solar energy for transportation fuel. The one thing that the report got right is that we need responsible policy to grow the right kind and amount of advanced biofuels in a consistent manner. To advance the discussion on how to achieve that, we need reporting from people who understand these concepts, and not a one sided expression of opinion from critics who would entrench our addiction to petroleum.
