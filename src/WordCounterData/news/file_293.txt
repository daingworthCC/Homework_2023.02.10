3050841 <p> In a series of sharply worded letters -- including one to President Bush 's White House counsel -- a former top federal official says he was fired to stop him from cracking down on misuse of public funds at the San Francisco Housing Authority. <p> Richard W. Mallory complained he was fired as Western regional director of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as part of a " coverup " of fiscal improprieties that was allegedly engineered by a powerful Republican official in Washington, D.C., to benefit Mayor Willie Brown. <p> Mallory 's letters, written soon after his dismissal, are the most recent allegations to roil San Francisco 's problem-plagued Housing Authority, which runs federal rent-subsidy programs and administers about 6,000 units of public housing in the city. <p> In the letters, copies of which were obtained by The Chronicle after HUD formally denied their existence, Mallory makes a series of serious accusations against the man who fired him : HUD Deputy Secretary Alphonso Jackson, who is the nation 's No. 2 public housing executive, as well as a confidant and longtime political supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a department head in the administration of former California Gov. Pete Wilson, claimed in his letters that Jackson shut down HUD 's efforts to force San Francisco to repay $1.8 million in federal funds that auditors say the Housing Authority has misused. <p> He also accused Jackson of thwarting a HUD plan to fine the city $400,000 for misusing federal grants in connection with an unusual real estate deal involving mayoral pal Charlie Walker and a Nation of Islam mosque. <p> HUD and White House officials declined comment on the letters, and requests to speak with Jackson directly were denied by HUD. A Brown spokesman said the dispute had nothing to do with the mayor. <p> When Mallory took office last December, the San Francisco Housing Authority was under fire. Housing Authority executive Patricia Williams had recently been sentenced to prison for taking bribes in exchange for federal rent subsidies. Its executive director, Ronnie Davis, was awaiting misdemeanor sentencing for misusing public funds at a housing agency in Cleveland, where he previously worked. <p> Mallory 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unresolved fiscal problems involving the Housing Authority -- " a time bomb waiting to explode " he called them in one letter. <p> But when he geared up a probe of alleged fiscal wrongdoing in San Francisco, Mallory said in one letter, an aide to Jackson " warned me not to anger the mayor or his Housing Authority staff, " saying that Jackson and Brown were friends. <p> When he persisted in probing the Housing Authority, Mallory said Jackson fired him. The dismissal came in February, two months after he began work in HUD 's San Francisco office. <p> " Jackson is attempting to use the authority of his office to provide undue and unwarranted treatment of the city " in connection with the misuse of federal funds, Mallory wrote. <p> White House spokesman Ken Lisaius referred queries to HUD, where spokesman Jerry Brown declined comment, saying a personnel matter was involved. <p> ' NOTHING TO DO ' WITH MAYOR <p> P.J. Johnston, the mayor 's press aide, said the dispute " has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not manage the Department of Housing and Urban Development, " he said. "( HUD Secretary Mel) Martinez does not take orders from Mayor Brown, by any stretch of the imagination. Nor do any of his undersecretaries. " <p> Housing Authority spokesman Mike Roetzer said Mallory had met with Executive Director Gregg Fortner but never raised any concerns. <p> " If Mr. Mallory was making those allegations or comments, he was making them behind our back, " Roetzer said. The agency is working with HUD 's Troubled Agency Recovery Center to resolve issues raised in the audit, he said. <p> Mallory, 49, is a career housing expert who served as a regional director of the U.S. Farmers Home Administration under President Ronald Reagan and as state director of Housing and Community Development under Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. <p> In December, President Bush named him to replace former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos in the $135,000-per-year regional director 's post in San Francisco, where he supervised housing programs for poor people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO WHITE HOUSE <p> Mallory 's allegations are contained in letters to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and HUD Secretary Martinez, and in an affidavit and letters to HUD 's office of the inspector general. <p> The letters asked for a probe of the alleged improprieties Mallory said he had discovered. Mallory, now a housing consultant in Sacramento, declined to be interviewed for this story. <p> HUD has refused to explain his firing. In May, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Chronicle, a HUD lawyer, Carole W. Wilson, claimed the agency could n't find any letters from Mallory regarding the San Francisco Housing Authority. HUD spokesman Jerry Brown said he had asked the department to " re-look " at the handling of The Chronicle 's query. <p> The Chronicle obtained the letters from a confidential news source. <p> Mallory wrote HUD Secretary Martinez that he took the job with the intention of rooting out " waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayers ' funds " in HUD programs in the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush wanted. <p> But he said his efforts were squelched by Jackson, a former Texas utility executive and onetime director of the Dallas Housing Authority. He has told reporters he became friends with the president in 1989, when Bush was his neighbor in Dallas. <p> When Bush ran for governor of Texas -- and later, when he ran for president -- Jackson was one of his most active African American supporters, leading his outreach efforts among minority voters. <p> As governor, Bush named Jackson to the state General Services Commission. Jackson also was assistant secretary of the Republican National Convention that nominated Bush for president in 2000. Bush named him to the No. 2 job in HUD in June 2001. <p> CLOSE PERSONAL FRIENDS <p> In his letters, Mallory said he learned early on about what he called the " close and well-known personal friendship " between Brown and Jackson. <p> Jackson had visited San Francisco in December, the week before Mallory came to work, and had been guest of honor at a City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. <p> During the visit, Mallory said, the mayor also took the HUD official on a private, daylong limousine tour of San Francisco and gave him two expensive hats as gifts. Mallory valued the hats at $600, and contended that by accepting them Jackson appeared to have violated federal ethics laws. <p> In the weeks that followed, Mallory said, Jackson thwarted his efforts to correct " gross program irregularities " at the Housing Authority. <p> Mallory said one problem area involved " an ongoing misuse of funds and failure to use competitive outsourcing " by the agency. <p> A toughly worded HUD audit in 2000 had found that the agency, with an annual budget of $200 million, had wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars of public funds through poor hiring and contracting practices and inflated executive salaries. Davis, then the director, was paid $188,000, plus bonuses and other benefits. <p> $1.8 MILLION FINE <p> The audit findings made the city liable to repay HUD as much as $1.8 million for public funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been resolved. Mallory said he wanted to impose the fine, contending that the city had refused to correct problems found by the auditors. <p> But he said that Jackson wanted to " reconcile the conflict " by dropping the fine and forgetting the audit 's other findings. <p> Another irregularity concerned what Mallory termed a real estate " scandal " involving Charlie Walker, the self-styled " Mayor of Hunters Point " and one of Brown 's most avid political supporters. <p> In a 1999 transaction that the city admits was fraught with problems, a nonprofit headed by Walker used a $51,000 federal grant administered by the mayor 's office to buy a building in Hunters Point. Without telling the city, Walker 's group resold it to a Nation of Islam affiliate, which used it as a mosque. <p> HUD ruled that the unusual deal violated strictures against using federal funds to support religion, and it ordered the city to pay back the current market value of the property -- as much as $400,000, by city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force the city to repay the money, writing that " There is no question that some of the revenues collected through the operation of this mosque will flow to the political coffers of Mayor Brown. " <p> But he said Jackson wanted to forgive the debt : He cited an internal HUD memo that said Jackson met with Brown 's staff about the issue and told them HUD was willing to forget the repayment. <p> Mallory 's letters describe HUD -- both in Washington and San Francisco -- as a place of brutal bureaucratic infighting and rampant cronyism. <p> BERATED BY HUD AIDE <p> Mallory said he was berated by Pamela Patenaude, an aide to Jackson, for sending her an e-mail regarding a Freedom of Information Act request filed by local television station KRON, which was researching a broadcast on alleged improprieties in the sale of Federal Housing Administration property. KRON was exploring any role that another HUD executive in the San Francisco office, Lily Lee, may have played, Mallory wrote. <p> Mallory said that in an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of the deputy secretary, " meaning Jackson, and upbraided him for sending her the e-mail because it was " discoverable, " meaning it could be revealed in a lawsuit. By Mallory 's account, Patenaude told him, " no one is to respond to this FOIA. " Federal law requires agencies to respond to Freedom of Information Act queries. <p> Mallory said that in January he balked at staging a press event with Mayor Brown to mark San Francisco 's participation in a HUD program to boost economic development in poor neighborhoods. Mallory argued that HUD officials should n't appear in public with Brown while he was refusing to clean up the problems at the Housing Authority noted in the audit nearly two years before. <p> Mallory wrote that he believed Brown complained to Jackson. A few weeks later, he said, Patenaude phoned and demanded that he resign : if he refused to write a resignation letter, she said he would not get severance pay and would be " escorted from the building by federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the next day he received a fax from Jackson notifying him he was fired. <p> After he left, Mallory began writing letters complaining about the problems he had observed. His letter to the White House said he had been told that after he was gone, Patenaude told HUD staffers that " there would be no investigation " of his allegations.E-mail the writer at **26;3878;TOOLONG
