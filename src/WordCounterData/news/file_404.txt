3068241 <p> First Night Colorado, Denver 's annual family-oriented, alcohol-free New Year 's Eve celebration, has announced a move downtown to the Colorado Convention Center from last year 's venue at Elitch Gardens. <p> When asked about the difference between the two locations, First Night 's founder and director Bill Michaels chuckled, " How about warmth? " <p> " At Elitch 's, " he said, " we took tents and heated them, and people walked from one to the other to watch the performances. It was good because it was all at one venue, which offered safety, security and parking. But it was 15 degrees outside. The rides were jammed - although mostly with kids. <p> " The favorable aspect of the convention center is that we 're all under one roof. We 'll have seven different stages, roving minstrels. From the moment you come until you leave, you 'll be entertained. And you 'll be inside with your coat off. " <p> First Night Colorado is a more than a nine-hour extravaganza of performances ending with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Events begin at 3 p.m. There 's a 5K foot race in Washington Park at 4:30 p.m. <p> Up with People will perform during the evening, as will the cast of " Beatlemania " and a lineup of Scottish bagpipers, Eastern European and African dancers, Mexican and Israeli musicians and others. <p> The original idea for First Night came from Boston, where for years sober revelers have visited the contained, historic downtown area, dropping into various locations to see and hear all sorts of performers - dancers, singers, comedians. <p> In Denver, First Night began when Michaels was talking with some colleagues about the Capitol Hill People 's Fair, which he produced in June 1988. Someone told Michaels that they thought New Year 's Eve in Denver was a drag but that Boston had a great downtown celebration, and why did n't something like it happen here? <p> On Dec. 31, 1988, it did. <p> " There was no LoDo, " Michaels said. " No ballpark. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Pena administration wanted something - anything - and they got wind of this idea. We found a few sponsors and started it off. " <p> For the original First Night Colorado, people wandered between performances at the Denver Performing Arts Complex, the Paramount Theatre and Prudential Plaza. The midnight countdown was at the D &F; Tower, and fireworks went off from the top of the tower. <p> " We did that until 1993, " Michaels said, " when the tower 's new owners got skittish about the fireworks. So then we went to Currigan Hall, the Executive Tower Inn and the Tabor Center. " <p> The fireworks display moved to Union Station, but by then LoDo had become an entertainment district and the 10,000 to 12,000 people who bought First Night tickets were joined by another 20,000 to 30,000 celebrants, many from LoDo bars and clubs. <p> " It was a difficult crowd, " Michaels said. " That had to change. At Elitch 's everyone there had paid to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 17,000 people. " <p> Elitch 's ca n't be used this winter because of new construction, but Michaels likes the change to downtown. <p> " There are huge rooms at the convention center. We can put a lot of people in there. A lot of people will come with their kids in the afternoon and then go home, and some will come back. People will come for " Beatlemania " and the Queen City Jazz band. Some people will come downtown for dinner and stop by here afterward. <p> " First Night is an alternative to the usual revelry. We do n't serve alcohol, but people can come downtown, have dinner and a drink, and come to First Night. " <p> But they wo n't see fireworks indoors at the convention center. Instead, Michaels said, there 'll be " indoor pyrotechnics - no, call them special effects.
