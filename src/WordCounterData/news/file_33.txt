3005041 <p> To many people in the theater, the decisions seemed unjust. " Wit, " this year 's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, was ruled ineligible for Tony Award nominations because after vainly trying to move to a Broadway theater, it could only be performed off Broadway. <p> " Rollin ' on the T.O.B.A., " which received strong reviews, was also deemed ineligible because it was mounted in an Off Broadway theater, the same one that housed " Cabaret " last year when it won four Tonys. <p> Elizabeth Franz was viewed as so critical to the current revival of " Death of a Salesman " that her name is listed above the title. But to improve her chances for an award, the producers successfully petitioned to have her moved from the leading-actress to featured category. Still, when the producers of " You 're a Good Man, Charlie Brown " tried to have two cast members elevated to the leading-actor category, they were rejected. <p> Things get touchy at Tony time. <p> When producing on Broadway has become increasingly expensive, and a Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show 's long life or quick death, the theater world is already awash in award controversy, even before Monday 's announcement of the Tony nominees. Perhaps this is an inevitable byproduct of weeks of special pleading and jockeying for position, with investments hanging heavily in the balance. <p> But each year dissatisfaction with the eligibility rulings seems rampant, raising basic questions : Is it outmoded to restrict the awards to Broadway productions? Are the awards essentially acknowledgments of artistic quality or marketing tools? Do favoritism and conflict of interest come into play when the awards committee makes critical decisions about shows like " Wit " and " Salesman "? <p> Despite having its petition denied, " Wit " may be awarded a special Tony. But whatever the outcome, some people in the theater, seeing such thorny conflicts arise each year, feel strongly that the Tonys, which will be presented on June 6 at the Gershwin Theater in a ceremony broadcast on CBS, need some serious rethinking. <p> " It 's unfortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American theater when the American theater was bounded by 42d Street and 52d Street is now out of date with what is called the American play, " said Doug Hughes, the artistic director of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, co-producer, with MCC Theater, of " Wit. " " I think petitions like ours are going to become a regular feature of every season, and I believe the definition of what is Tony-eligible will be broadened. " <p> While acknowledging some illogic in rulings like those on " Wit " and " T.O.B.A., " Tony officials say they walk a fine line between adhering to long-held standards and responding to changing times. <p> " The theater does n't stand still, so we have to have a certain amount of flexibility, " said Roy Somlyo, the president of the American Theater Wing, a nonprofit group that encourages the theater and jointly presents the awards with the League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade group. " By the same token we have to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awards ceremony was presented in a Broadway theater by the theatrical producer Alexander Cohen and his wife, Hildy Parks. But the Tony event has become increasingly glitzy in recent years : presented at Radio City Music Hall, presided over by Rosie O'Donnell, fueling tension between the Theater Wing and the producers ' league. <p> Increasingly, producers lobby for their properties and try to negotiate a constellation of rules and seemingly idiosyncratic decisions. Just two days before this year 's deadline for nominations, for example, the producers of " It Ai n't Nothin ' but the Blues " moved their revue from the ineligible New Victory Theater to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. <p> When Peter Stone 's revised book of " Annie Get Your Gun " was deemed Tony-eligible at the administration committee 's April 1 meeting, the producers of " Charlie Brown " followed with an April 19 letter asking for the same consideration for their updated book.( There is no award for best book of a revival, so Mr. Stone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Charlie Brown " producers lost that bid as well as their effort to follow the example of the producers of " Salesman, " who managed to win consideration of Ms. Franz as a featured actress rather than in the lead category, in which her competition would have been Judi Dench and Zoe Wanamaker. <p> The Tony logic can be hard to follow. " Swan Lake " was ruled ineligible for consideration as best play or best musical this year, yet individual performances will be eligible as will the choreography. <p> Some industry executives attribute apparent inconsistencies to the makeup of the 24-member Tony administration committee : representatives from the league, the wing and the unions who, some suggest, may be more motivated by self-interest than fairness. Conflicts, Real And Perceived <p> " It probably is not the best idea to have the people administering the Tony Awards who often have a built-in conflict of interest in some of the issues, " said Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company and Livent Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I have to assume that they do, there still can be an appearance of a conflict of interest, which is sometimes just as bad. " <p> But Keith Sherman, a spokesman for the awards, said, " We take our charge very seriously, and we think that the Tonys and the system is beyond reproach. " <p> Ashton Springer, who produced " T.O.B.A., " said he was baffled by the committee 's decision not to consider his show about the heyday of black vaudeville, which closed three days after its petition was rejected. " Cabaret " was ruled eligible in the same theater last season, the Kit Kat Klub, formerly Henry Miller 's Theater, on West 43d Street. <p> " They make up new rules as they go along, " Mr. Springer said. " If it 's something they want to do, it will happen. If it 's something they do n't want to do, it wo n't happen. " <p> Tony officials said the reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klub failed to apply for Tony status in the year since " Cabaret. " They said that the Roundabout, producer of " Cabaret, " simply used the Kit Kat Klub for its authentic nightclub environment, although it has a Tony-eligible theater of its own, Stage Right at the Criterion Center. <p> " It was the right decision, " Mr. Somlyo said. " On the surface it looks horrendous. But you have to go just a quarter of an inch deeper. " <p> In the " Wit " petition, Mr. Hughes argued that the producers tried hard to find a home on Broadway last fall and had raised a million dollars for such a move yet were rebuffed because the play deals with a woman dying of ovarian cancer. <p> " We found ourselves with more than adequate capitalization, a sheaf of unanimous raves and the doors to every available Broadway theater slamming in our faces as we listened to a refrain of ' Too depressing, ' " Mr. Hughes wrote in the appeal. <p> Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he knew the deck was stacked against the show when he and Mr. Hughes faced the administration committee. " Why would the majority of people in that room, who had other plays represented on Broadway that would be in direct competition, want ' Wit ' to be eligible? " he asked. <p> The committee includes producers with competing shows and members of the Actors ' Equity Association. There are also people like Mr. Stone, who left the room when the committee voted on eligibility for his rewrite of " Annie Get Your Gun. " <p> The Tony rules specify that committee members must abstain from votes in which they have an interest, although they may participate in discussions of the proposal. <p> Several committee members said personal concerns were set aside. <p> " The committee, despite having agenda after agenda, has functioned fairly well, " said Emanuel Azenberg, one of the producers of " The Iceman Cometh. " " They vote almost always with some logic. " <p> The logic at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members said, was clear-cut : Only Broadway shows are eligible, and " Wit " is off Broadway, at the Union Square Theater. Arguments Against Special Status <p> Led by Robert Whitehead, a longtime producer, the administration committee is scheduled to meet today to consider his proposal to give " Wit " a special commendation at the Tony ceremony. <p> But others in the theater say " Wit " is no special case. Other acclaimed Off Broadway plays have been ineligible for Tony consideration, like " How I Learned to Drive " and " Three Tall Women, " both of which won Pulitzers. <p> " There are lots of shows that ca n't find Broadway theaters, " said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the league. " So the idea that you would be eligible for Tonys because you want to be on Broadway, that seems sort of odd. " <p> Whether Off Broadway productions should be included for Tony consideration raises questions about the cost to Off Broadway producers and the logistical difficulty of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers have argued against their own inclusion on grounds that already meager potential profits would be considerably reduced if they had to pay union scale or give free seats to Tony voters. <p> Some members of the administration committee said they might someday consider the possibility of creating a special Tony Award for Off Broadway, the way they created one for regional theater in 1976. <p> But others are adamant about keeping Off Broadway out of the Tony mix. <p> " It 's very, very expensive to mount a Broadway musical ; it might cost $10 million, " said Rocco Landesman president of Jujamcyn Theaters who sits on the administration committee and unsuccessfully argued against the Roundabout becoming Tony eligible in 1991. " I do n't see why someone who puts up a musical for $1.98 gets the same privileges automatically. We 've been handing out Tony eligibility like candy, and as far as I 'm concerned it has to stop. " Raising Questions About the Voters <p> Another question has to do with Tony Award voters themselves. More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are eligible to vote. Many of them have not been active in the theater for years, yet as long as they pay dues to the league, $1,000 a year, they retain their voting status. Proponents of stricter membership rules call it the cheapest theater subscription in town, given that each voter gets two tickets to every show on Broadway : a $5,000 value, one producer estimated. <p> Mr. Azenberg said it was costing him $150,00 in free tickets for " Iceman " alone. " You have to maintain the qualifications, " he said. <p> Voters sign their ballots pledging to have voted only for plays after having seen all the nominees in a given category, but many in the theater are skeptical. " What it is is a freebie list, " said one producer. <p> Mr. Azenberg said the management committee was considering more stringent criteria for voter eligibility, although this could cut into the membership fees that support the league. <p> http : //www.nytimes.com and Livent Inc.( Don Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why someone who puts up a musical for $1.98 gets the same privileges automatically.
