4137541 Groundbreaking technologies often arrive with a bang. But when an air bag racing suit from Italian motorcycle apparel company Dainese was deployed in Costa Mesa this week, the sound was a barely audible pop as the back of the leather suit instantly puffed with helium gas to protect the rider 's shoulders and collarbones. In the real world, Dainese 's D-Air Racing suit would inflate only in the case of a crash on a racetrack, amid the cacophony of competing motorcycles approaching 200 mph. But for its long-awaited U.S. debut Monday, it was triggered on a stage before a small audience. " We 've been getting requests every day asking when this is going to be available, " said Roberto Sadowsky, vice president of operations for Dainese 's U.S. headquarters in Costa Mesa, which will begin selling the suits to U.S. consumers in September. Dainese, which employs 35 people in its Costa Mesa-based operations, garners $147 million in annual revenues globally. D-Air has been worn by professional racers since 2009 and has been available since 2011 to European riders, who have bought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Each leather suit costs $2,499, of which $700 is attributable to the highly sophisticated system of sensors that analyze a rider 's movement in combination with accelerometers, gyroscopes, a computer and the air bag. All of that is housed on the rider 's back, in an aerodynamic hump situated between the shoulder blades. D-Air has been in the works for 15 years, much of that time spent collecting data to understand riders ' normal movements and to develop software that could determine aberrations and deploy the air bag only when necessary and well before the rider 's impact with a hard surface. From loss of control to deployment takes 45 milliseconds. A collection of D-Air Street jackets for motorcyclists who ride on public roads also will be available in the U.S., but its specific release date has n't been determined. D-Air Street requires sensors on the motorcycle 's fork, in addition to those in the jacket. The sensors detect a frontal collision and instantly relay that information to the jacket wirelessly so it can deploy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper body. D-Air racing suits and street jackets are capable of one air bag deployment, after which they need to be returned to the factory to be rearmed at a cost of $200. " Wearable safety technology is an exciting option for today 's motorcyclists, " said Tim Buche, president of the Motorcycle Industry Council in Irvine, which estimates the size of the U.S. motorcycle apparel market at $2.2 billion annually. That technology just is n't widely available - yet. Only one company - Alpinestars, like Dainese, based in Italy - offers air bag apparel in the U.S. Dainese and Alpinestars are among a handful of predominantly Italian companies that are incorporating air bags into wearable safety gear, the availability of which has largely been limited to Europe and the United Kingdom. A competing Italian apparel brand, Spidi, makes an air bag vest that is worn over a jacket or leather suit and is attached to the motorcycle with a tether that, when separated from the bike, triggers the inflation of two air bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cause injury. Alpinestars, whose U.S. headquarters is in Torrance, also makes racing and street versions of air bag apparel. Its Tech-Air Race suit has been available in the U.S. since 2012 at a price of $4,999.95. This spring, it will release a pair of Tech-Air Street jackets in Europe and the U.K. The availability of its street jackets in the U.S. has n't been announced. The Tech-Air Street system uses a microprocessor to monitor data from five sensors placed around the body. The sensors detect acceleration from the rider 's movements in 3D and feed that information to the microprocessor every two milliseconds. If the computer senses a loss of control, it inflates the air bag in 25 milliseconds to protect the rider 's shoulders and front and back sides of the torso. The system 's electronics and air bag inflator are embedded in a back protector. The air bag is housed in fabric layers that are fitted into an outer jacket. The Tech-Air Street air bag system retails for about $2,250 in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or $733. Behind the push for air bag apparel " is the demand for proper protection for riders, " said Heath Cofran, technical media spokesman for Alpinestars in Torrance. Motorcycle riders are 26 times more likely to die in a crash than occupants of passenger vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The most common two-vehicle crash between a motorcycle and a passenger vehicle occurs when the front of a motorcycle strikes the side of the other vehicle, usually during a left turn, according to a 2007 NHTSA study. While the most common injury resulting from a motorcycle crash is to the rider 's legs, upper torso clothing prevented or reduced injury in 64.6 percent of all motorcycle crashes, according to the 2004 Motorcycle Accidents In Depth Study. The effectiveness of air bag apparel has n't been thoroughly studied, but Dainese reports that only one of the 19 racers using its D-Air system since 2009 has suffered a broken collarbone - one of the most common injuries in motorcycle racing and one of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intended to be worn in addition to helmets. " These systems are n't magic. They 're an insurance company that will write you a partial policy, " said Kevin Cameron, technical editor for Cycle World magazine, who nevertheless thinks that motorcycle air bags will become more commonplace, especially once their cost falls. NHTSA credits frontal air bags in automobiles with saving more than 42,000 lives in the U.S. since they were first required for passenger vehicles in the late ' 90s. The use of air bags by motorcycle riders holds the potential for similar improvements - and not only in apparel. Manufacturers are beginning to incorporate the protective technology in their bikes. In 2006, Honda began offering an air bag option on its popular Gold Wing tourer. Devised to reduce injuries resulting from frontal collisions, the air bag deploys from the motorcycle in a module positioned in front of the rider. If sensors mounted on the motorcycle 's forks detect a collision, the bike automatically deploys the air bag to help absorb the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The air bag version of the Gold Wing adds $1,470 to its price. In 2014, Dainese partnered with Italian motorcycle maker Ducati to add D-Air to its Multistrada model. The bike is equipped with sensors on its forks that communicate with the electronics in the Dainese jacket to automatically inflate its air bag in the case of a frontal collision. The $25,300 Ducati Multistrada D-Air is available only in Europe, for a $1,300 premium over the base model. Dianese is also working with Yamaha and other manufacturers to incorporate its D-Air technology in their bikes and says a kit can make any motorcycle compatible. " Eventually we want to see this on every bike, " said Dainese 's Sadowsky. He added that the company is making its technology open-source. Sadowsky predicts that every Dainese jacket will include D-Air technology as standard equipment, much like elbow and shoulder armor. **25;4839;TOOLONG On Twitter : @OCRegCarpenter
