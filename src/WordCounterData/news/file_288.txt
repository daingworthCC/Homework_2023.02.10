3050241 <p> My husband, Tim - formerly known as " Chicken Bucket " because of his passion for chicken fried in a special pressure cooker( called a Chicken Bucket) - now believes that there is <p> really only one chicken recipe, roast chicken. Well into his 50s, he has cut down his cocktail consumption, works out( something he swore he would never do), and lost about 20 pounds since his Chicken Bucket days. But his love of chicken remains unabated. He does n't regularly eat spicy, extra-crisp, Popeye 's fried chicken anymore, and his Chicken Bucket has disappeared into the basement. However, once a week he roasts a chicken and it 's always delicious. <p> Sometimes he preheats the oven to 400 degrees, generously sprinkles kosher salt over a whole chicken, and roasts it on a poultry rack for about an hour, depending on the size of the bird. At other times he preheats the oven to 450 degrees, generously sprinkles kosher salt over a whole chicken, turns the oven down to 350 degrees and roasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound. Though the skin does n't get quite as brown and crisp during this slower cooking method, the meat stays juicier. <p> If he 's particularly hungry, he cuts the chicken into parts - leg and thigh, breast, wings, back - lays the pieces on a cookie sheet with 1-inch sides, generously seasons the pieces with kosher salt, and cooks them for 45 minutes in a preheated 400-degree oven. The skin on all the parts becomes very crisp and golden using this last method, especially the wings and back, the best parts of the chicken. This cut-up roast chicken is best eaten hot. The crispy skin loses its charm when cold and the meat tends to be dry. <p> Of course the key to any roast chicken recipe - and the one point that none of the myriad roast chicken recipes that claim superiority over every other roast chicken recipe ever mention - is the provenance of the chicken. The kind of chicken you roast really does make a difference. <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will have lush flavor and juiciness. Hoffman Game Birds is a small, family-owned business in Manteca, in San Joaquin County. All their birds are raised from their own breeding stock and fed whole grains milled to Hoffman 's specifications. No additives, steroids or antibiotics ever find their way into the feed. The chickens live in a succession of open houses and large pens where they can roam and forage amid natural grasses and weeds. They are butchered by Stockton Poultry, a local plant, and delivered to market promptly by members of the Hoffman family without ever being stored. These chickens are about as fresh as you can get.( You can buy them at the Ferry Plaza Farmers ' Market on Saturday - but you 'd better come early because they run out.) <p> Mass-produced supermarket chickens are trickier to cook. They tend to dry out and have an off-flavor. I wo n't go into the grim details of factory chicken production, but typically the birds are fed appetite stimulants and antibiotics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept in cages so crowded they ca n't move. The meat from these chickens lends <p> itself to marination and saucing. <p> If you ca n't get your hands on a Hoffman bird, try to find a Fulton Valley Range Chicken at an <p> independent grocer. Fulton Valley chickens eat a diet of 75 percent corn, 25 percent soybeans, sorghum or other grains, with no additives, appetite stimulants or antibiotics. The range chickens are raised in open-sided houses with dirt and sawdust floors, not cages. But we 're not talking about open-field grazing here. A 22,000-square-foot chicken house holds 22,000 chickens with an adjoining 22,000 square feet of outdoor area. The chickens do get to peck around outdoors for bugs and rocks, but each one does n't exactly have beachfront property. Fulton Valley chickens are shipped on ice, which means they are delivered fresh. <p> Rocky the Range Chickens and Rosy Organic Chickens from Petaluma Poultry Company, sold at Whole Foods markets, and, with head and feet attached, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space indoors and out as Fulton Valley chickens, but the Rosy Organic chicken is the only certified organic chicken available in San Francisco that I know of. It eats only <p> organic corn, soy and other grains that are specifically not grown from genetically modified plants. <p> Just because Tim has given up his Chicken Bucket does n't mean that he 's given up chicken eating. In fact he strongly believes in the restorative powers of roast chicken. A couple of years ago, a friend of his tore his Achilles ' tendon on the tennis court. The brilliant academic( who, as recently reported in Variety, signed a $750,000 deal for a book on Shakespeare), had no business stepping onto a tennis court with me.( No fewer than three men of a certain age had gone down within months. It was scary.) <p> Tim knew exactly what to do. He brought a short-barrel, pump-action shotgun, an uncooked chicken, and a CD of Hvorostovsky arias to his house. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unloaded gun and listened to music. When the chicken was done, Tim made hot roast chicken sandwiches on toasted crusty white bread, liberally dressing them with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper and mayonnaise. The bedridden academic was amused by the gun. Not a serious eater, he may not have appreciated the luxuriousness of roasting a whole chicken just for sandwiches, but he basked in the attention. Upon recovery, he moved to the East Coast and married an English professor/underwear model half his age. Could it have been the chicken? <p> Though I firmly support Tim 's move to roast chicken, occasionally I like to prepare chicken in other very simple ways. After all, a good chicken is so naturally tasty, you do n't need to do much to it. The following recipe from Lydie Marshall 's " Chez Nous : Home Cooking From the South of France "( HarperCollins, 1995) is one of the smartest dishes ever devised. Actually easier than making a roast chicken, the recipe requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yogurt( I use the incomparable Straus Whole Milk <p> yogurt), Dijon mustard and chicken cooking juices, and the chicken itself takes on a handsome brown crust. I always serve this chicken with pasta - either homemade, if I 'm so inspired, or imported Italian penne or fettuccine from a box. Given the season, little Brussels sprouts are the vegetable of choice, especially good with the creamy mustard sauce. <p> Niloufer Ichaporia King, one of the world 's great home cooks, suggested I steam a chicken. Having only eaten steamed chickens in Chinese restaurants that offer Hakka specialties, I was <p> dubious about doing it at home. As usual, she was right. It could n't have been simpler to execute and the outcome was stunning. I used a Rocky the Range chicken, a little over 4 pounds, which I purchased at Mollie Stone 's Market in San Francisco from a butcher who happened to be Chinese. I told him I wanted to steam a chicken and asked for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he told me, and picked out the exact bird I had been eyeing. " Salt it for a week and steam it for an hour, " he told me. <p> At home I washed and dried the chicken, generously rubbed it with handfuls of kosher salt, set it on a plate, covered it with plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator for three days. Before steaming it, I washed off all the salt and set it on a small glass pie plate that fit into my inexpensive aluminum Chinese steamer - an essential piece of kitchen equipment. When the water at the bottom came to a boil, I put in the chicken, covered the steamer and let it steam for 45 minutes, the amount of time that Niloufer had recommended. When it was done, clear, pure, chicken juice pooled in the bottom of the pie plate and the chicken had plumped up, its skin had become a handsome yellow. I lifted the whole chicken onto a heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never have I tasted a moister, more velvety breast, or indeed any other part of a chicken. Cooked in its own juices, the steamed chicken tasted intensely chicken-y. The cooking method captured its very essence. I served it with jasmine rice, wok-sauted spinach with ginger and a quick green sauce I made in the food processor : a 1-inch by 1-inch nugget of peeled ginger, a large clove of garlic with inside green sprout removed, a whole, green jalapeno chile, a thick bunch of cilantro, all of which I chopped individually by hand and then threw into the cuisinart with a big pinch of salt and about a quarter of a cup of peanut oil. Frankly, the chicken did n't need it. Even cold the next day, the steamed chicken kept its silken texture and dewy moistness, the leftover juice becoming an elegant and pure-flavored chicken aspic. This is the way to cook a chicken for any kind of cold chicken salad, Asian or Western. <p> Finally, if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating chicken, try the pollo asado at Pancho Villa Taqueria( 3071 16th St. between Mission and Valencia, San Francisco) where they now offer it as a filling for their super-fresh tacos and burritos. To be honest, I 'm not a big fan of the soupy chicken fillings usually offered in taquerias. The drier preparations like carne asada and carnitas( pork cooked in its own fat) hold their own with beans and salsas and contribute the taste of the grill to tacos. The chicken used in pollo asado has been dry-rubbed with spices that seem to deepen in flavor as the chicken hits the fire. And one big advantage of pollo asado over carne asada is that you can chew it. <p> Chicken with Yogurt and Mustard <p>( adapted from " Chez Nous : Home Cooking From the South of France " by Lydie Marshall, HarperCollins, 1995) <p> 11/2 cups plain yogurt <p> 1/3 cup strong Dijon mustard <p> 1/2 teaspoon salt <p> Freshly ground black pepper <p> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into 8 parts ; or 4 pounds of chicken parts, trimmed of all fat <p> 1. Preheat oven to 400 F. In a large baking dish, mix the yogurt and mustard. Season with salt, pepper and thyme. <p> 2. Dunk and turn the chicken parts in the mixture until each one is coated. Bake the chicken uncovered in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown. <p> 3. Transfer the chicken parts to a serving platter. <p> 4. Process the curdled yogurt sauce in the food processor or blender to smooth out the sauce. <p> 5. Serve chicken and sauce immediately with fresh pasta. <p> Patricia Unterman 's " On Food " column runs biweekly in the Chronicle Magazine.
