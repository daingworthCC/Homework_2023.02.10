3046741 <p> For forty-five years " containment " of Soviet power provided the organizing principle of American foreign policy. Now, as the Soviet threat diminishes and our resources appear constrained, some Americans argue for a " return to America, " to a concentration on addressing our domestic ills, while others maintain we must " stay engaged " internationally. It is appropriate that such a debate should occur at a time of enormous international political and economic change. <p> Those who favor focusing on domestic priorities maintain that global threats to American interests have diminished and domestic threats are accelerating in their severity. Moreover, they say there is no logical and sustainable American leadership role in the complex world of the 1990s. Each of these arguments is important. <p> Alan Tonelson of the Economic Strategy Institute, in the lead article in the July Atlantic, argues that " the disconnection between the nation 's needs at home and its ambitions abroad is at once bizarre and dangerous. " <p> William Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, maintains that " never since the great Depression has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States must, in Hyland 's words, " start selectively disengaging abroad to save resources and seize the unparalleled opportunity to put our house in order. " <p> " The United States has never been less threatened by foreign forces than it is today, " maintains Hyland. Certainly, with the retrenchment of Soviet power this is demonstrably true. Further, Saddam Hussein 's unhappy experience with American and allied power should inhibit other regional aggressors from acting precipitously. <p> DOMESTIC DETERIORATION <p> Meanwhile our domestic needs cry for relief. The commentator Kevin Phillips writes, " The American Dream is crumbling, not just in inner city ghettoes and farm townships, but in blue collar centers and even in middle-class suburbs. " <p> The statistics are frightening : 30 to 40 million Americans are living in poverty ; one in five children in America is poor ; the life expectancy of a male resident of Harlem is lower than his counterpart in Bangladesh ; half the children who entered primary schools in urban areas in this country in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans have no health insurance. At home we are clearly a nation at risk. <p> Finally, say those who argue for a " return to America, " there is no clear global role for the United States. Neither, they maintain, can we afford broad engagement -- nor do our interests demand that we be so engaged. The American people will not support the United States being latter-day Hessians protecting others unwilling to protect themselves. <p> These are important arguments individually and in sum, but the case remains debatable and ultimately unpersuasive. <p> Those who believe the United States must stay broadly engaged internationally are less sanguine about emerging threats to our global interests, more willing to believe that a great power like ours can handle both domestic and international challenges, and more likely to point to a responsible international role for the United States. <p> " An American total retreat toward domestic reform, " writes Professor Stanley Hoffman in Foreign Affairs, " would be a serious moral and political mistake, comparable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces what historian John Gaddis calls " forces of fragmentation. " Nation states from Yugoslavia to the Soviet Union to India are threatened with breakup. We are clearly in a period of significant unpredictability. <p> INTERNATIONAL THREATS <p> Moreover, the Cold War 's passing has not removed the threat of regional conflict. Saddam Hussein was not unique. He may well have drawn the wrong conclusions from the precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984 and believed we would not challenge his aggression. Unfortunately, there are many other candidates for regional mischief whose actions could impinge on our interest -- North Korea against South Korea, Pakistan and India, China against Taiwan, Syria against Israel and so on. The less likely U.S. intervention, the more likely that one or more of these potential conflicts will occur. <p> But more than military security interests and commitments tie us to the rest of the world. Fifteen percent of U.S. GNP comes from global trade : almost $ 300 billion annually across the Pacific and more than $ 200 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured goods and 30 percent of our farm production. <p> Millions of American jobs depend on international commerce. We are enmeshed in the lives of others -- environmental problems know no borders and are worsening ; refugees from conflict and economic deprivation seek our shores. <p> What of our domestic difficulties? It does little good to point out that they are largely self-inflicted. We created our budget morass and trade deficit through our unwillingness to match domestic savings with domestic investment. Our dependence on foreign capital and foreign oil reflects an inability to curb our national appetites. We have allowed health care costs to double in less than a decade. We have permitted the quality of education in this country to deteriorate. <p> Our domestic problems are serious. The fundamental question is whether we lack the resources or the political will to address our problems. John Gardner at Stanford University writes : " I do not find the problems themselves as frightening as the questions they raise concerning our capacity to gather our forces and act. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will to manage and solve its most serious problems appears impaired. " <p> WILL, NOT WALLET <p> Both are right. The United States produces roughly a quarter of the world 's GNP. Our problems are not wallet, but will and capacity to achieve consensus on solutions to our nation 's problems. Retreating from responsibility and interest abroad will not restore our political will at home. It will only place in jeopardy vital American interests beyond our shores. <p> This raises the issue of the American role in the New World Order. Certainly a prudent downsizing of America 's military presence abroad is called for and is occuring. We can not fight every fight and indeed have no intention of doing so. We will retain security responsibilities, as well as economic interests, in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our interests in Latin America and Africa are largely economic. <p> What, then, are the guidelines for American engagement abroad? <p> First, the United States must remain broadly engaged. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no stake in building a stable global community of nations. We must remain committed to expansion of democratic values, peaceful resolution of disputes and an open trading system. <p> Second, we can not expect to pursue economic interests and diplomatic initiatives while eschewing the possible use of force to protect our interests. We must retain the credible capability to project force. Precipitous U.S. withdrawal from security commitments abroad will create vacuums in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. This will tempt would-be aggressors. We made this error following 1919 and 1945. We must not do so again. <p> Third, Paul Nitze is right in arguing that a central theme of U.S. foreign policy " should be the accommodation and protection of diversity within a general framework of world order. " Nations around the world are struggling with issues of governance. Our democracy is a powerful example for many. <p> We must, however, appreciate that these struggles are not easy and that solutions for countries at differing stages of political development are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change but should not seek to dictate it. <p> MULTILATERIALISM <p> Fourth, increasingly we have an interest in multilateral solutions to problems -- security and otherwise. The era of the Lone Ranger is passing. American unilateralism will generally not accomplish our goals. <p> Fifth, some regional partnerships will be more important to us than others -- with Germany in Europe and with Japan in Asia for example. It will be critical, therefore, that we not let trade differences obscure larger interests. <p> Sixth, the United States must maintain support and leadership in providing foreign assistance. We must continue to demonstrate our conviction that global development, environment and population challenges must be met by global responses. We must be sensitive to the fact that democratic values are difficult to nurture and sustain when people are hungry. <p> Finally, it is important to recognize that American power and influence in the world are due to several factors : military strength, economic power, decades of international leadership and the attractiveness of American political values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erode relative to that of other regions, most of the other elements of our power will be eroded over time. <p> It is essential, therefore, that we address our domestic economic and social problems. But it is not necessary for a great power like the United States to abandon its international interests to do so ; we have within us the wealth and the capacity to be successfully engaged at home and abroad.
