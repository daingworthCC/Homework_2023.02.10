4195741 <h> ' Master of None ' : Aziz Ansari opens up about his Muslim upbringing <p> Warning : The following contains plot details from Season 2 of Master of None. <p> Fans of Aziz Ansari know from his work that he likes talking about romantic relationships, he 's obsessed with food and he gets lost in Internet black holes. <p> Not quite as obvious to casual followers of Ansari 's comedy : He was raised Muslim. <p> Aziz Ansari, here with his real-life and TV parents Fatima Ansari and Shoukath Ansari, has a ' Master of None ' episode about his Muslim upbringing.( Photo : Andrew Toth, FilmMagic) <p> It is n't a main topic of his standup sets, does n't come up in his book Modern Love and was n't a major part of the first season of his semi-autobiographical show Master of None. <p> However, Ansari broached the topic of religion in a big way last June, in a somber New York Times op-ed that was critical of President Trump 's rhetoric about Muslims. He followed it with a scathing monologue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration. Now he addresses the subject through his character, Dev, with the third episode of his new season of Master of None, which hit Netflix last week. <p> The episode, called " Religion, " gently and affectively shares Ansari 's Muslim experience, making it relatable to those outside the Muslim faith. <p> It opens with a younger version of Ansari 's Dev, tasting bacon for the first time at a friend 's house. For little Dev, it 's love at first bite. <p> " Bacon is pork. We are Muslim. We are not allowed to eat pork. That is our religion, " Dev 's mom, played by Ansari 's real-life mom, Fatima, explains on the phone. " Hurry up and come home. " <p> Dev eats the bacon anyway. <p> Fast-forward to present-day, where a not-at-all religious 33-year-old Dev explains to a friend that he has to " put on a show " when his Muslim relatives are in town. " We 're Indian, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he tells his cousin. <p> Of course, it 's not just Indians raised Muslim who put up faux-religious fronts for their relatives. An opening montage of different children being dragged into various places of religious worship, from a synagogue to a Church of Scientology, emphasizes the episode 's universal themes. <p> But Dev reaches a turning point. He decides to stop pretending that he fasts for Ramadan and attends mosque every week while at dinner with his religious parents and aunt and uncle. <p> He makes a speech. <p> " I 'm not that religious. And I eat pork. But it 's OK ' cause I 'm a good person and I 'm 33 years old and I can make those decisions. I can eat what I want. And I wan na eat the crispy pork with the broccoli. " <p> And then Dev explains, without being preachy, how being Muslim is n't quite like practicing other religions. <p> " I get it, " he says to his family, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not like that for me. It 's people calling me ' terrorist, ' and getting pulled out of airport security lines. " <p> The TV monologue drives home the point Ansari made on SNL and in the Times. <p> " Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think ' Muslim, ' the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. It 's of a scary terrorist character from " Homeland " or some monster from the news, " Ansari wrote. <p> The episode concludes with Dev 's parents attending a Mosque and greeting friends, juxtaposed with Dev going to a bar and meeting up with his crew, as if to subtly say they 're just like you. <h> Posted! <p> A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. <p> ' Master of None ' Season 2 is now available for devouring on Netflix. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Aziz Ansari, numerous celebs gathered at New York 's SVA Theatre on May 11, 2017.
