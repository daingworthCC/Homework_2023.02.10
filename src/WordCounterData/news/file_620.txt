4135941 Five-year-old Finn Green stood at attention, his face set with determination, cheeks flushed and blond hair lightly dampened with perspiration. His sensei, Todd Aimer, knelt in front of him so they were eye to eye. " You 're showing maturity that I 've never seen in you before, and I think it 's because of what you 've been through, " Aimer told Finn. Finn 's battle with a complex form of liver cancer was his world in recent months, but now his focus was dead set on the eyes of his sensei. Feb. 21 marked the day Finn would receive his yellow belt - a tangible symbol of the progress he 'd made in karate at Z-Ultimate Self Defense Studios in Huntington Beach. But instead of a yellow belt, Aimer pulled out an orange one. The steadfast stare of a karate student with discipline well beyond his years was replaced with wonderment more fitting of a 5-year-old as Finn realized he had jumped two levels. " As much as you 've grown up and as much as you 've gone through, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This represents the hard work you did while you were away. " During that time, Finn was nearly put on the list for a liver transplant, which could have meant a lifetime of medication and potential complications. Instead, a program developed by a team of doctors at Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital Stanford saved Finn from going on the transplant list. A stomach pain that would n't wane during a trip to Mexico in July became serious enough for Stephanie and Edward Green to bring their son in for an ultrasound while the family was on vacation. Doctors found an enlarged liver and what they thought was a possible gallstone. The Greens, both medical professionals - she a family practice physician and he an orthopedic surgeon - said they did n't worry about what the scan showed at first. After a follow-up MRI found the potential gallstone was actually a large cancerous tumor, the calm and collected demeanor of Stephanie Green as a medical professional became the all-consuming worry of a mother. " When I found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she said. " I could n't sleep for two days. " But the Greens did n't dwell on the diagnosis. They researched the tumor, called a hepatoblastoma, to find which medical facility would be best to treat Finn. Three Southern California hospitals came back with the same diagnosis : The tumor was too complex and too large to remove. Finn would need a liver transplant. Transplant was a path Stephanie Green did not want for her son unless every option was exhausted. " You have to take medication for the rest of your life with a transplant, and those meds can cause heart disease, " Stephanie Green said. " They also have their whole lives of having to deal with possible liver rejection. " At the recommendation of a neighbor, the Greens met with Waldo Concepcion, chief of clinical transplantation at the Stanford University Medical Center, who had a different plan on how to treat Finn. A program developed by doctors at Stanford and UC Berkeley specifically tailored to getting MRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a one-time surgery for Finn. " In our thoughts, you can always fall back on transplant, but we can not go the other way, " Concepcion said. MRI requires patients to be still and hold their breath on and off for about an hour, which can prove difficult for young children. Some children have to be put under anesthesia for the test to be performed. " That takes( a noninvasive test) and turns it into a much bigger deal, " said Shreyas Vasanawala, co- director of MRI at the hospital who helped develop the program. " There 's such a barrier for children to get MRI scans that it 's not even thought about sometimes. We 've really been focused on trying to break down those barriers. " GE Healthcare and Stanford doctors built miniaturized hardware for the MRI machine to better fit children. Specialized software was also developed, allowing for quicker MRIs with sharper pictures. Although Stanford 's program is n't unique in the country, it is rare, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort that is really directed at pediatrics, there 's not a lot of that going around, " he said. " I think what 's unique is probably how deeply embedded into our clinical practice this is. It 's not isolated to the lab. " Concepcion added that Finn 's story not only shows how this specialized MRI can benefit young patients, it also illustrates the importance of challenging health care providers. " Always have different opinions from people who have a lot of experience, " he said. " Really get informed, read about it, and ask the questions you want to ask. " Concepcion removed about 60 percent of Finn 's liver during the four-hour surgery in July. Most of it grew back in the six weeks following the procedure. Finn said he remembers waking up in the hospital to a large purple incision that ran down from the right side of his rib cage and across his belly. The incision is now a scar Finn proudly shows off to his classmates, neighbors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through two rounds of chemotherapy, which he finished in October. Finn 's dad and three brothers shaved their heads so he would n't feel different during his treatment. " He 's so brave, " Stephanie Green said. " He was so grown up about it. " Finn returned to karate in November and has since been preparing for his test. Finn 's parents and brothers, who also train at the studio, looked on proudly as accepted his orange belt. " I got it because I was really good at karate, " he said. " It 's great because I 've always wanted an orange one. " Life has returned to nearly normal for the Greens, with occasional reminders of those stressful weeks in July coming in the form of check-up appointments and Finn asking, " Mom, can I go play, or do we have to go to Stanford? " Now, Finn is cancer-free, and his parents said they believe he will stay that way. " I just ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stanford, " Stephanie Green said. " They just changed our whole family 's life. " 714-796-7953 or jfletcher@ocregister.com
