4086841 When it comes to selecting materials for flooring, cabinets, or furnishings, it can be difficult to see the trees through the forest. But it 's important to sort out the sustainable woods from those that will do harm to tropical rain forests and natural habitats. # Fortunately, there are myriad resources out there to guide homeowners along the right path so that exotic and sustainable are not mutually exclusive. # " I 've noticed a trend in the growing desire for exotic sustainable flooring and cabinetry such as bamboo, which is a grass, and eucalyptus wood from Australia, " says Julie Edwards, the sustainable coordinator for OZ Architecture in Denver. " These are fast-growing and look beautiful, so you can feel good about using them. They come in a variety of colors and can be stained in reds or pale tones. " # Palm wood, from reclaimed palm trees no longer producing coconuts, has a distinct look because of its short grain, Edwards adds. # " The( palm) trees are now being collected specifically to make flooring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used to make tiles ; the shells are sliced to create tiles for vertical and horizontal applications. " # Edwards also is starting to hear a buzz about wood flooring from rubber trees. # " This is not rubber flooring but wood from the tree itself. It 's similar to palm wood in that when the tree stops producing sap, they are typically thrown away. The wood is light and smooth-grained with a little striation. It has n't quite caught on yet but is becoming more popular because of its sustainability. " # Many of OZ 's clients, including those remodeling lofts, are interested in reclaimed wood with its seasoned look and patina. " What people are really into is the character of the reclaimed wood, and the stories behind it, " Edwards says. # Domestic and exotic # Mesquite has traditionally been used in the South but its popularity has grown. Viewed by some as a waste wood, it grows quickly and meets green-design goals, says Debbie Hindman of Denver 's Associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and that 's what our clients love, particularly for kitchen and bath flooring and cabinetry, " she says. # Making use of beetle-kill pine is also a trend in this region, she notes. With an abundance of it available, woodworkers and cabinetry makers are finding creative ways to work with it. It is appropriate for wainscoting, cabinetry, millwork and furniture. A durable water-based finish helps protect it, even on flooring. # Bamboo is a distinctly beautiful, rapidly renewable material ; embraced early on by the green-design movement, it receives mixed reviews. # " For bamboo, just as with any resource, you have to know where it comes from and that the source is credible, " Hindman says. " There are a handful of well-established, reputable companies for bamboo that manufacture responsibly. " # The Lacey Act, amended by Congress in 2008, is designed to prevent endangered species, including exotic woods, from getting into this country. As of this year, the legislation requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend, " Hindman says, " is in responsibility, and that approach has hit mainstream, requiring the industry to be more diligent. The Rainforest Alliance Network tracks woods on their endangered list. Most people realize deforestation is happening but do n't hear the specifics when it comes to exotic woods. " # Veneers that feature composite or engineered wood are a viable option, Hindman says. " This process sustainably harvests more commonly occurring, fast-growing plantation-grown species to create the look, feel and warmth of more exotic and, oftentimes, threatened tree species without having to actually harvest them. " # Teak rules # Callan Childs is an associate with Barrett Studio Architects in Boulder. # " We are seeing a lot of interest in reclaimed materials, " Childs says. " Tropical hardwoods, such as teak, are also becoming popular. Specifying reclaimed domestic and tropical hardwoods offsets the demand for virgin wood and helps preserve the world 's remaining forests. There is also an inherent beauty in reclaimed wood and even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard to match with new material. " # Clients are showing an interest in tropical hardwoods for two primary reasons : their color and hardness, she says. " Teak has varying medium hues while wenge is very dark heartwood. These are colors that are generally harder to find within domestic species and were traditionally achieved by staining a lighter wood. Both woods are extremely durable. " # Barrett Studio clients Linda and Alan Stark chose Brazilian teak for the floors of their north Boulder ranch home. # " We chose it for its brown tones... and its elegant look, " says Linda Stark. " Even with a dog and a husband who is a mountaineer, the floor is still gorgeous. Guests are always commenting on it. " # Childs cautions homeowners to be informed about where their wood is coming from and how it is sourced. # " Not all wood is harvested using sustainable forestry management techniques, and some is even obtained illegally. Whenever possible, select wood that has been FSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to layer elements within a room. The resulting look has a depth achieved through the combination of modern and rustic materials and furnishings. # " This careful blending of styles adds a wabi-sabi quality to a space, a Japanese aesthetic that finds beauty in things that are imperfect, " Childs says. # Bruce Kranzberg 's BKI Woodworks in Boulder is a custom cabinet shop. # " We achieve a similar look to wenge, which is an espresso, chocolate-black color, by using rift-sawn white oak veneer that is stained and dyed, " he says. " It has a similar grain pattern that emulates wenge, which is not readily available or from sustainable forests. " # Rift sawn lumber is a cutting technique that gives a lower material yield but straighter grain and beautiful figuring. Rift-sawn lumber is available in oak, walnut, and sometimes cherry for cabinetry and interior finishes. CVG fir is another similar wood in grain appearance that is popular these days. # Combinations of materials, such as dark woods with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Kranzberg says. One approach would be to make one kitchen cabinet different from the others, or to create a kitchen island in a different color from the cabinets. Mixing it up gives a bigger variety.
