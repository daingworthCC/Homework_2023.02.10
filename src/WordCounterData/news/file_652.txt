Livingston( 54), left, and DB Sandy Chapman, right, in the first quarter of their football game at Dick Price Stadium in Norfolk, Va., on Saturday, Sept. 24, 2016. He was short of the goal line. <h> NORFOLK <p> With six minutes left in Norfolk State 's game at North Carolina A&amp;T on Oct. 6, T.C. Livingston teamed with fellow linebacker Kyle Archie to bring down A&amp;T running back Amos Williams at the line of scrimmage. <p> The play, Livingston 's 10th tackle of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss. <p> But consider that 14 hours earlier, Livingston had been in Charlottesville having breakfast with a team of professors and graduate students vetting him for consideration for acceptance into the University of Virginia 's prestigious Woodrow Wilson Department of Politics. <p> The long day was but a glimpse into Livingston 's boundless ambition. Ask Livingston, a junior who left Suffolk 's King 's Fork High with questionable grades and exactly one offer to play college football, where he sees himself in 10 years, and there 's a pause in his rapid-fire pace of conversation. <p> A political science major who is active in the campus political scene, Livingston aspires to work as a U.S. ambassador in the Middle East or Africa after giving up his final year of football eligibility to attend grad school. <p> But then there 's this acting thing, too. Livingston is a member of NSU 's Theater Company, and his first paid acting gig starts Dec. 6 : He 'll play the Ghost of Christmas Future in the Virginia Stage Company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-foot-3, 200-pound Livingston is described by his coach, Latrell Scott, as " a very special kid " and " kind of the true student-athlete. " <p> Livingston could see his post-football career going either way. And he 's fine with that. <p> " Uncertainty is the most exciting part of life for me, because I never know where I could land and what possible things I could do with my life, " he said. " So it is very exciting. " <p> Despite a wide range of interests that includes a collection of about 25 unique watches and teaching himself to play piano, there are few surprises for Livingston. <p> Late at night, after all the obligations of academics, football and acting have been properly juggled, Livingston lies in his on-campus apartment and sees visions. In some, he 's overseas, interacting with foreign leaders on behalf of the U.S. government. In others, he 's on stage, playing a dramatic role. <p> Ask Scott, whose 1-5 team enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees Livingston in 10 years, and he rattles off a list of Livingston 's varied interests. <p> " T.C. 's the kind of kid that can be anything he wants to be, " Scott said. " I think, be it something in the political realm or in the theater realm ; the kid 's so well rounded. " <p> Not everyone can go from a Division I sport to theater to foreign affairs and back, but he pulls it off. The trick, he says, is to be able to move from one pursuit to the next, compartmentalizing each interest. <p> " When I come on the football field, I turn on that switch to play football, " Livingston said. " And then, after practice when I was doing my play earlier this semester, I turned that switch off and turned into an actor. And then, after acting rehearsal, I would turn that switch off, become an academic. <p> " It all has its different type of challenges, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can really broaden my spectrum as a human being. " <p> It was n't always this way. At King 's Fork, where he was a first-team All-Southeastern District linebacker as a senior, lack of motivation led to a 2.1 grade-point average that turned college coaches away. <p> Only Pete Adrian, then the Spartans ' coach, showed legitimate interest. Adrian called Livingston during his senior year and told him that NSU 's staff thought he could play there. Adrian, who retired after the 2014 season, helped arrange after-school classes that got Livingston 's GPA up to 2.6 in a single semester. <p> Combined with his SAT score, Livingston made himself eligible. Adrian offered him a scholarship on the afternoon before National Signing Day. <p> " Just from trying, " said Livingston, the son of a preacher and a caseworker who counsels troubled kids in Suffolk. " Just from actually putting forth the effort. That 's all it really takes, is the effort to say you 're going to make something happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of everything. <p> " I felt like I owed it to them( NSU 's coaches) to do my best in academics, " said Livingston, who now sports a 3.5 GPA. " They were one of the real reasons -- the real catalyst -- that got me to want to be better in school. " <p> That day in Charlottesville was evidence of his commitment to academics. Riding along as an NSU faculty athletics representative drove so he could rest, Livingston made it to Greensboro, N.C., for the N.C. A&amp;T game by around 5 p.m. <p> Scott said allowing him to make the trip was a no-brainer. <p> " T.C. 's got a chance to go to one of the most prestigious schools in the country, " Scott said. " And if I 'm his football coach and I do n't make it possible for him to do it, then I 'm not the person that I told these kids ' parents that I was. So it 's truly an academic-first type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prepare -- show up at the stadium at 5 o'clock and walk away with 15 tackles. " <p> No one knows that better than Archie, a junior from Norcom High who spends ample time playing video games and discussing life with Livingston. The pair bonded on a nine-hour bus ride to Savannah State in 2014, back when star linebackers Lynden Trail and Deon King took the bulk of the snaps. <p> " We had to wait our turn, because we had some good linebackers in front of us, " Archie said. " So it 's real nice to see everything come full circle from freshman year to now. " <p> Indeed, Archie and Livingston have provided NSU 's defense with a 1-2 punch. Archie leads the team with 50 tackles, and Livingston has 45. The numbers come just a season after Livingston did most of his playing on special teams. <p> His size, linebackers coach Andrew Faison said, only makes the total more impressive. <p> " I know linebackers are the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Faison said. " But he 's 200 pounds, right? Fighting against linemen that are 300 pounds. He knows how to shed and get off and still be in on the play. <p> " He 's come a long ways. " <p> Livingston possessed that same intelligence and guile when he arrived at NSU, even if his grades had n't shown it to that point. Like many freshmen, he had no idea what he wanted to study -- until a meeting with political science chair Dr. Olusoji Akomolafe. <p> Livingston liked the options that could come along with a political science degree, and international diplomacy appealed to him, despite having never left the country. <p> That will change next summer, when he visits South Africa with the school 's theater company. The trip will produce a rare intersection of his passions. Until then, Livingston plans to continue broadening his interests. <p> He has grad school applications in at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, and he 's considering attending an acting audition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced-degree students compete for scholarships. <p> Livingston knows he 's in the position he 's in through a combination of proper guidance and hard work. <p> " I should n't be here, " he said. " But from the grace of God and people that love to help other people, that 's why I 'm here. <p> " At the end of the day, if you put enough focus into anything, then it 's hard not to be able to accomplish it. All it takes is focus. " <p> Moments later, he turned, snapped on his helmet and trotted out to the practice field. The switch had been flipped.
