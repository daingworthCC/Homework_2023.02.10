3060441 <p> Homemade holiday magic tucked prettily inside a paper bag with red and green tissue paper, then sealed with a sentiment as sweet as the gingerbread inside. <p> Cookies are so perfect a Christmas gift. <p> A box of orange-cranberry biscotti or a tin filled with cinnamon maple pinwheels is an inexpensive and easy-to-make expression of good will for neighbors, for bosses, for best friends, for a homeless man you pass every day on the way to the train. <p> If you think this notion is a bit old-fashioned, you 're getting the point very nicely. <p> " It 's about sharing and caring, " said Mara Reid Rodgers, a spokeswoman for TimeLife Books ' Christmas Is Cookies, who is baking soft molasses cookies this season for her mail carrier, among other people. " I try to think of people who have touched my life in a small way. " <p> Holly Garrison, author of The Cookie Book, will be wrapping up cookies for people who wo n't have time to bake. " Do you know how much they 're appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like giving a piece of the past. She even uses her grandmother 's rolling pin( the same one her mother used) and her mother 's battered cookie cutters. <p> " Everybody has some memory of a cookie. Mine are very early ones of baking at Christmas with my mother -- the big, glorious mess we made, flour everywhere, eating raw dough. " <p> Sugar-and-spice cutout cookies, the recipe leading our Christmas cookie menu, is from Garrison 's book. <p> We chose it for tradition : Every kid loves to decorate and every adult loves to receive a cutout cookie. And we chose it for extra flavor : This one is spiced up a tad, cinnamon with ginger and nutmeg making it more interesting than the standard sugar cookie. <p> Use colored sugars, candies, dried fruits and fancy touches such as dragees -- those lovely silver and gold balls -- to decorate before baking. <p> To decorate after baking, make a simple icing that will harden : Stir together 1 cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaspoons of light corn syrup. If it seems too thick, stir in a few more drops of milk until spreadable. It can be piped onto cookies using a pastry bag or a small plastic bag with a corner tip snipped off. Or make it a little thinner for glazing the cookies by adding small amounts of corn syrup. Stir up several bowls of icing with a bit of a different food coloring in each. <p> Cranberry-orange biscotti is a delicious and sophisticated representation of the trendy dipping cookie. Biscotti means " twice baked " in Italian, and this recipe does it by the book -- baked once in loaf form and then again after being cut into crescent-shaped pieces. Dried cranberries add a nice tartness and a Christmas look, but they 're slightly expensive so consider them optional. Loads of pecans and orange zest will carry the cookie. <p> Ginger pennies are tasty, crispy discs that people will pop like candy. Rose Levy Beranbaum, who included the recipe in her book Rose 's Christmas Cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than tiny ; you should have at least 25 dozen cookies. Use a plastic freezer bag with a corner cut off to pipe small dots of dough onto baking sheets. <p> Rose 's crescents, also from Rose 's Christmas Cookies, is a delicate buttery cookie rolled in cinnamony sugar. The topping <p> calls for superfine sugar ; you can buy it or make it by processing regular granulated sugar for a minute in a food processor. <p> For grownups only are Kevin 's eggnog cookies, a drop cookie with heavenly flavor from rum extract and a sprinkling of fresh nutmeg. The brandy frosting is optional but puts this one over the top. If you use the frosting, you wo n't miss a thing by substituting vanilla extract for the rum extract. The recipe is from The Complete Cookie, by Barry Bluestein and Kevin Morrissey. <p> Thanks to Mrs. Fields ' Best Cookie Book Ever for cinnamon maple pinwheels, a pretty and too-yummy swirl painted with real maple syrup before baking.
