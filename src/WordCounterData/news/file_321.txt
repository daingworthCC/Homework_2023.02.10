3054841 <p> The smallmouth bass was fighting like the devil, not altogether surprising since it was swimming in the Devils River. The chocolate fish drove through the blue-clear water then jumped once, twice, on rapid fire. <p> My 6-pound Spinfisher reel buzzed as line cut downstream. The line angled past a rock shelf and I scrambled along the bank to keep the field clear. The fish dove again, stripping more line against the bent rod. <p> " Not bad for openers, " said Gerald Bailey, standing nearby. <p> The tiring fish weaved back in the current. It was a gorgeous bass with a bronze finish glowing against the dark dopples and slashes. The body was almost trout-like and the fins seemed uncommonly large. And the eye of this devil 's jewel was a startling ruby red. <p> The smallmouth slushed and wallowed against the bank as Bailey gently lipped it for a quick release. The soft-plastic tube lure slipped from the jaw and the bass flashed back into the aquamarine pool. <p> " Twenty inches? " I asked. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure, " he said. " Anything over 18 inches is a fine fish. " <p> Bailey, ramrod of Devils River Outfitters, should know. He is the reigning Devils Advocate, the only full-time, serious fishing guide/outfitter on the remote spring-fed river north of Lake Amistad and Del Rio. He is a local, having lived the past six years on the river, and he takes maybe 75 clients a year on overnight canoe fishing expeditions. <p> Considering the fact that maybe 200 people a year float the Devils, that 's a significant roll call. It is safe to say that nobody during the past few years has spent more fishing time on the river than Bailey. <p> On the days he is not guiding two-man parties he often goes solo to the river and just looks. The undammed Devils is that kind of place. <p> But, look up and down, left and right, and you would never know he had been there. He leaves no lasting marks on the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other visitors. <p> This " river keeper " attitude has gained him respect at the Devils River State Natural Area, a 20,500-acre wilderness facility( previously the Finegan/Dolan Creek Ranch) about midway up the navigable drainage. <p> Not the least of this respect is overnight access to a cabin near the river. This comfortable outpost knocks a lot of the rough edges off the river( notorious for limited public access and long, rough floats between legal take-out points). Bailey charges $ 150 per day per angler for his full-service package. <p> Dave Hayward of Houston and I fished with Bailey last week. It was our second expedition within three year, and the drill was typical of the operation he now offers. <p> We drove the afternoon before to Del Rio( 5 1/2 to 6 hours from Houston through San Antonio), and booked a motel room. <p> Following a pre-dawn alarm, we drove north about 45 minutes on Highway 277 to rendezvous with Bailey at the Loma Alta Store( " Howdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left our vehicle at the store( standard procedure) and loaded all gear into Bailey 's truck for the short drive to the entrance to the Devils River State Natural Area. We 're here, you think. Wrong. <p> The distance from Highway 277 to the park headquarters is smooth - no, bumpy and dusty - 20 miles over all-weather gravel roads through the desert terrain of hills and arroyos. <p> Daily park access is $ 5, plus $ 30 a head for use of the river cabin. Only recognized river guides can reserve the cabin and, since Bailey presently stands alone in that field, he has a pretty slick deal working. <p> We registered at the park office( the log book showed maybe 40 or 50 visitors for the first quarter) and proceeded past a locked gate to the river road. <p> The cabin, built by the Finegan family in 1961, is a cool oasis situated amid a grove of heavy oaks down a hard-rock trail. From the stream or the access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bailey typically spends the first day bank-walking and wading. The state owns one mile of river frontage on the east bank, plenty of water for two anglers to work during a full day. <p> The second day is reserved for the canoe. You paddle the short distance to Dolan Falls, portage below, then fish choice water downstream for several miles before ramming back upstream for the final take-out back at the state area. <p> That 's a long day, but less gruelling that scrabbling and crawling across miles of basically unfishable river during a prolonged float. <p> Most of the Devils within range of these two-day expeditions is blue-chip water. The stretch of river bending around the state area offers many pools and runs with an abundance of fish-holding ledges, rocks, " flutes, " and undercuts. <p> Numerous springs bursts and bubble from the limestone cliffs to feed the flow and the shallow pools and shoreline weeds are rich with baitfish. <p> The spring water gushing from the Edwards Aquifer looks clean and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a thorny Eden. <p> Wildlife is plentiful, sometimes almost close enough to touch, but the smallmouth bass are the big draw. <p> The " smallie " or " brownie " of the Ozarks and northern regions is not native to Texas ; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department stocked them in Lake Amistad during the late 1970s and early ' 80s, figuring the deep, clear, rocky reservoir offered adequate habitat. They were close. The lake was adequate ; the river was ideal. <p> The fish ran up the Devils and dug in, spawning with success and establishing a fabulous fishery. The lack of regular fishing pressure on the small river allows the fish to flourish ; indeed, the smallmouth is the predominate predatory species in the river, far outnumbering the native largemouth and various lesser sunfish <p> What you may have heard is true : The smallmouth is a harder fighter than the largemouth. <p> Catch the two species side-by-side on the same tackle, in the same water, and the difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallow and jump, but the smallmouth wants to live. <p> It shows a style and stamina similar to a really hot rainbow trout. Or, maybe a saltwater snook. The smallmouth is a smaller bass than the largemouth, but a two or three pounder placed in perspective is a wonderful game fish. <p> And, most special of all are the river fish. Lake bass tend to get lazy and fat while the fish bucking current grow lean and mean with uncommon drive. All the Devils fish we caught( largemouths as well) were trimmer than the reservoir stocks. They were in vibrant condition - just slim. <p> Hayward theorized that in the ultra-clear water, the bass were less ambush-oriented and forced to spend more time aggressively chasing open-water prey. I 'm no fisheries biologists, but that makes sense and would support the streamlined silhouettes. <p> Each trip has it high moments. One was that first smallmouth. Another was watching an 18-incher rush like a bonefish across a knee-deep white flat to snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at night on the deck at the cabin, looking the bright moon through the spanning oaks and smelling big steaks on the grill. <p> One more high time was hearing the turkeys gobble - behind the cabin, across the river, dawn challenges booming off the rimrocks. Still another was simply not falling in ; my felt-sole boot hit a slick spot and I flailed and spun like a loose cannon across a shallow shelf before regaining traction. <p> The balancing act was blind and frantic luck, but Mary Lou Retton could not have executed any better. <p> But the defining statement of the trip occurred during the final 15 minutes of the first afternoon. I eased into a narrow side channel and waded upstream, casting a Heddon Tiny Torpedo topwater lure. <p> It was an old lure, almost a relic, one saved from childhood forays for " brownies " on the Ouachita River at Ozark summer camp in Arkansas. The small plug had not seen water for almost 40 years. <p> Why not, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> White riffles spilled into the gray swirl and twist of a deeper run. Tendrils of foliage hung low, shadows on shadows, to form an almost ethereal canopy. The little plug sailed forward and landed with a silver tinkle against the undercut bank. A fish struck. <p> It was n't a brassy blast, more of a confident surge. I " set up " and the reel squealed. A long flash pushed left and right in the tight channel, then an epic smallmouth bass jumped. Minutes later, amid darkness, it slid to hand. The patient old plug was pinned just like yesterday to the jaw. <p> But what a bass - what a drop-dead, world-class smallmouth bass. It measured at least 21 inches on the rod, probably 5 pounds, the largest I have touched. <p> I flipped the treble and glided the brute back into the flow. It was a great fish from a special river. I stepped from the channel and secured the hook to the rod. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battered little plug and the memory of glowing copper against a baleful eye as red as the devil. <p> NOTES : For additional information, call Devils River Outfitters at 830-395-2266.
