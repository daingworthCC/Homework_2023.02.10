3030341 <p> Any hopes that a spent bear might soon lose its grip on the stock market vanished Wednesday, as renewed selling hammered blue-chip stocks and sent the Dow Jones industrials crashing below the 10,000 mark. <p> This time the financial desperation took on a global air, as fresh concerns about the Japanese banking system sparked furious selling in Europe that spread to U.S. markets. <p> The Dow plunged 317 points, to 9973, the first time the blue-chip index closed below 10,000 since October and the lowest close since exactly a year ago. The Dow is on track for its worst weekly decline in more than a decade. <p> The broader Standard &; Poor 's 500 index slipped even further into bear market territory -- widely considered a drop of 20% or more -- with a 2.6% drop that left it 23.6% below its March 2000 high. <p> The Nasdaq composite did n't lead the decline for a change, dropping just 2.1%, as the most severe selling centered in banks and other blue-chip stocks. Unlike recent drops, the trigger for Wednesday 's slide came from outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not bail out that country 's failing banks. <p> Meanwhile, investors continued to sort through the market debris. A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken after the U.S. markets closed suggests that Americans are bearing up but that the market fall is taking its toll on their financial outlook. <p> More than two-thirds of those surveyed said the stock market decline has not caused them to feel less confident about their personal financial situation. But 42% said it has had at least a minor impact on their finances, and 21% said they were considering putting off a major purchase. <p> Confidence in their own situations did n't extend to the economy. Fifty-one percent said the market 's decline made them feel less confident about the nation 's economy. <p> Dorian Meaders, 49, an office manager for Belmont University in Nashville, says she and her husband have most of their retirement savings in the stock market, mostly in stock mutual funds. Meaders says she avoids looking up the balance because " I know it 's going to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, because we 've already lost it, " she explains. " We just figure if we try to play the market, we 'll lose more money. " <p> Don Clingerman, 34, a General Electric employee from Morgantown, W.Va., takes comfort in having a long time before retirement to recover. His investments include stock mutual funds and GE stock in a retirement account. <p> Says Clingerman : " This is the first major snag in my investing life. I 've always been lying in wait for this but now that it 's here, it 's unsettling. " <p> Triggering the sell-off <p> An international credit rating agency put 19 major Japanese banks on its watch list because of concerns the Japanese government wo n't bail out ailing banks. That in turn fueled concerns about the Japanese economy and the potential spillover on its major trading partners. <p> " That 's what triggered the sell-off in Europe and here, " says L. Roy Papp, a money manager who oversees $ 1 billion in assets. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finally fess up to, " says Fred Puorro, a managing director at Fitch, the credit rating firm. But he says Wednesday 's reaction was overblown. " Everyone is looking at the ripple effect. Is this in some way a contagion? We do n't think it is. " <p> But skittish U.S. investors dumped shares of Citigroup, Bank of America and other banks out of fear the companies could be infected by the Japanese financial crisis. And the sell-off quickly spread throughout the market as Wall Street got hit with another wave of profit warnings. McDonald 's, Northwest Airlines, Clorox and Nextel all braced investors for poorer results. <p> By day 's end, the damage was widespread. All 30 of the Dow stocks fell. On the New York Stock Exchange, more than twice as many stocks hit new 52-week lows as hit new highs. Based on the Wilshire 5000 total market index, about $ 310 billion in stock value disappeared. <p> The unrelenting nature of the decline has many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selling pressure selling subsides, let alone before a sustained rebound will begin. <p> Fueling economic worries, the government said business inventories increased 0.4% in January as consumers cut back spending. <p> So though some investors were worried about the Japanese markets dragging down the USA, others were concerned that troubles here could hurt other regions around the globe. <p> " Our challenge is to fix this before it spreads in a major way to Asia/Pacific, Latin America or Europe, " said John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, who was speaking in Boston. " We are already, however, seeing challenges in Korea, Taiwan and Australia. " <p> Last week, Cisco announced it would lay off 11% to 17% of its work force. The network equipment maker already warned investors that it is making less money than expected. <p> All of the major global stock exchanges, except Tokyo 's, fell Wednesday. But Tokyo stocks slid sharply at the opening of today 's trading. The benchmark 225-stock Nikkei average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the morning session. <p> And in another example of just how connected the global markets have become, McDonald 's said the hamburger chain would miss its financial goals because of Europe 's trouble with hoof-and-mouth and mad cow diseases. <p> Pressure on the Fed <p> Market turbulence puts new pressure on the Federal Reserve to produce a major interest rate cut when it meets Tuesday. For now, most Fed-watchers say, policymakers are likely to produce another half-point cut -- substantial compared with the Fed 's preferred quarter-point moves, but no bigger than the two half-point cuts the Fed made in January, which have yet to deliver measurable benefits. <p> Talk now is of the possibility of a three-quarter point cut. <p> " The consensus will still be leaning toward( a half-point cut), but straddling the fence a little more evenly, " says Louis Crandall chief economist for Wrightson Associates. <p> The futures markets, where investors in effect bet on what the Fed will do, have raised the odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Perils abound whichever course the Fed takes. <p> Too shallow, and investors would be disappointed. A half-point cut " has been widely expected, and if we get no more than( that), people are going to say, ' Ho-hum, that does n't really come to our rescue, ' " says Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. <p> Cut too deep, and the Fed risks a perception that it 's a mere safety net for the markets when its formal job is to preserve broad economic growth. <p> Southwest Bank of St. Louis, which has developed a reputation as a harbinger of Fed actions, said Wednesday that it would cut its prime rate, which it charges its most creditworthy borrowers, a half point to 8% from 8.5%. The bank cited a slowing economy. <p> Investors hanging on <p> Investor Michael Loesekann, 56, an engineer in Alexandra, Va., is taking the long view of the market. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned, " he says. <p> He regrets not having scooped up bargain stocks a decade ago when the market was down. But he says he 's poised so that this buying opportunity does n't pass him by. <p> " I 'm ready for this one, " he says. " When it( the Dow Jones industrial average) hits 9000, then I 'll invest. " <p> Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView Economics, agrees with Loesekann : " The seeds of the next round of multi-millionaires are being sown today " because of buying opportunities, he says. <p> Carey Foster, 51, a middle-school gym teacher in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., looks to his waistline in these troubled times. Says Foster : " I compare a growth fund to my weight. Eventually I keep growing larger. Sometimes I may go on a diet and lose a little weight, but I always get it back. My growth funds are on a diet now. " <p> Ted Cartwright, 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride with his stock in computer chip maker Broadcom. <p> He invested about $ 1,500 in Broadcom when its stock was trading for $ 25 a share. He watched it soar to a high of $ 274 a share last August. On Wednesday, the stock closed at $ 34.50. " I 've gone from making almost $ 10,000 in that one stock to about $ 300, " he says. <p> Like many investors, he is thinking now about what might have been. " When it was selling for around $ 100 a share I thought I could sell it, but this is a long-term holding. " <p> He 's philosophical about the damage. Since he makes regular contributions to his savings plans, the decline " means I can buy more shares with the same money, " he says. " This time last year, I could buy maybe three shares. Now I can buy six. " <p> " Even through all this, I do n't have a problem sleeping, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now, we 're going to say, man, that was stupid.
