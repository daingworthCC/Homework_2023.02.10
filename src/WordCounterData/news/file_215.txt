3041441 <p> In a recent story about Sen. Lauch Faircloth( R-N.C.), I was quoted as saying that he was " the most ardent in the Senate " in calling for investigations of members of the Clinton administration, but that he " has some questions of his own to answer. " <p> In discussing Mr. Faircloth 's activities, I referred, of course, to a seeming lack of disclosure by the senator with respect to his hog holdings, estimated to be in the neighborhood of $ 20 million, and his sway over wetlands issues now that he serves as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that deals with wetlands. <p> I take none of this any more personally than any citizen who wonders whether their government is honest and acting in the national interest. In response to my saying that there are questions to be answered, the senator said of me, " He 's an( expletive). He does n't know what he 's talking about. " <p> While this is what passes for informed debate in Washington these days, there is a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be believed in implying that there is nothing to the ethics questions raised by his activities as a hog farmer and as chairman of the wetlands subcommittee, why does n't he just answer them? <p> Benes is managing director of the Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C. <p> The new Deal MATT COLEMAN, Atlanta <p> Say it ai n't so, Nathan Deal! He 's not only managed to deal away his credibility in the eyes of his 9th District constituents, but has also created the most divided House delegation in the country, all in one dramatic move. <p> As a conservative Democrat, I respected Deal 's independence and voice within the Democratic Party. I doubt he 'll get one word across in the current Newtonian-dominated environment of the Republican Party. <p> I once thought of Deal as a leader ; now I know he 's a follower. Without props KENNETH R. LEEBOW, Marietta <p>( Syndicated columnist) Ellen Goodman and many others in the press lead us to believe that we should right a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accouterments in the new memorial in his honor. <p> I say, " Hogwash, " to the self-righteous press. This is the same press that hid FDR 's frailness from us and to this day presents issues as they want us to see them, not as they are. <p> The press is as far off base today as it was in the days of FDR. So for all those people with disabilities : Wear them proudly. And let FDR be remembered as he wanted everyone to know him in his glory years. <p> TRAGEDY AT A PARTY First and fast WADE DuBOSE BURNS, Atlanta <p> Atlanta has distinguished itself from many American cities by a spirit of volunteerism evidenced by the thousands who help Atlanta tackle tough social issues. <p> Atlanta is also known as a city where chief executives volunteer their prestige, time, talent and resources to improve the circumstances of our youth at risk, our adults in peril and our communities desperate for opportunity. <p> So, it was not surprising that BellSouth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, talent and even his home to help the Salvation Army in its important mission. <p> When the deck of his home collapsed and his guests were injured, it was not surprising that he refused medical attention for a painful broken pelvis until all other injured guests were taken to hospitals. <p> What is surprising is a lawsuit filed faster than a hospital flower can wilt. Less than 48 hours after the accident, a hospitalized host is sued by a hospitalized guest. <p> A lawsuit is a remedy when parties with an issue ca n't agree on fair resolution. There clearly has been no opportunity to first reach a fair resolution between the parties. This lawsuit wo n't promote healing for anyone. <p> Self-preservation LARRY I. GOLDFINGER, Stone Mountain <p> So Mr. and Mrs. Robert Gerish filed suit against Frank Skinner, stating that he allowed too many people to gather on his deck. If it was so obvious that the deck was overloaded, why did n't the Gerishes get off? Probably because they were too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now looking for a free lunch? <p> Record of peace GENE KAPP <p> A recent editorial 's claim that the views of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson are at odds with statements made by Ralph Reed before the Anti-Defamation League are absurd. <p> Mr. Robertson has been an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism and longtime defender of Israel and the Jewish people. The record is clear : On March 4, Mr. Robertson clearly articulated his position on anti- Semitism in The New York Times : " I condemn and repudiate in the strongest terms " those who support anti-Semitism. <p> In 1991, on " The 700 Club, " Mr. Robertson spoke out strongly against David Duke 's Louisiana gubernatorial bid : " It 's very dangerous in America to foster hate. " <p> In his 1990 book, " The New Millennium, " Mr. Robertson responded to a growing concern by Soviet Jews that a rising tide of anti-Semitism could result in a full-scale pogrom : " Intolerance in any quarter is wrong, but inasmuch as we are able, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of a Jewish homeland in Israel and not for the elimination of the Jews. " <p> And in 1994, at a Jewish-Christian solidarity rally in Washington, D.C., Mr. Robertson said : " Those of us who are evangelicals say to those of you who are Jewish, we are your friends. We stand with you. " <p> Kapp is vice president of public relations for the Christian Broadcasting Network, based in Virginia Beach, Va. <p> Negative action LEE SKANDALAKIS, Atlanta <p> How would you feel if you were told that because you belong to a certain group of people, you are not quite smart enough to compete for a university position, a job, a bid on a contract, or just about anything else? How would you feel if you were told that in order to compete, your entrance exam scores would have to be adjusted upward or a quota created? <p> Welcome to affirmative action. This one program threatens to polarize our society in a way not seen since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality reigns and merit counts. Affirmative action needs to be dismantled completely and immediately. <p> Rights not for rent JENNIFER McWHORTER <p> I was dismayed at the one-sided, inflammatory TV news coverage of the temporary increase in car rental rates that will occur over Freaknik weekend. Students interviewed decried the unfairness of the special rates, complaining that " college students just ca n't afford these prices " and that Atlanta business owners are " sending a message. " <p> Sure. The message is : " We learned our lesson. " <p> Business owners have the right to protect themselves from financial losses, and car rental is not a guaranteed right. <p> McWhorter is a graduate student at the University of Georgia. Well-deserved day MIKE CUNDIFF, Atlanta <p> I was troubled by Colin Campbell 's Diary on Wednesday. He is worried about how much money we spend when a president declares a national holiday for the passing of a former president. <p> The whole idea of this declaration is to honor a person who served their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and I and Campbell are asleep. Being president is not exactly easy. It may be filled with lots of perks, but you also have people looking at you and into your life all the time. <p> Look at a picture of President Bush before he was elected and after he left office. He aged more than four years in that time. <p> Us and them? REGINALD McCORD, Atlanta <p> I take exception to a recent letter writer 's statement, " We as a country have bent over backward to accommodate minority groups. " He and others like him need to finally wake up to the fact that this country is no longer exclusively theirs. <p> I am an African-American male, whose ancestors have contributed mightily to the success of this country. <p> That letter writer closes by saying, " We ca n't let the agendas of some minority groups dictate and undermine the progression and values of our society. " <p> The " agenda " is to reap the rich fields of political independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have earned. Unfortunately, that letter writer still think its his values and his society that dictate to the rest of us.
