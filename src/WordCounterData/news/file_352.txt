3060341 <p> ' Iknow people get much more out of them than I put into them, that 's for sure, " Kinky Friedman says, knowing he 'll get a laugh. And he does. <p> He 's talking about his nutty books, the nine mystery novels he 's pounded out over the last decade. All feature a shaggy sleuth named Kinky Friedman who bears a very close resemblance to his creator. <p> Which means he 's wise, witty, offbeat, brilliant, sophomoric, spaced out and full of more one-liners than a fortune cookie factory. Kinky, or " The Kinkster, " as he 's renamed himself of late, may be many things, but mostly he 's funny... in a Confucius-meets-a- ' **28;716;TOOLONG kind of way. <p> Even Bill Clinton is smiling. " More please. I really need the laughs, " the president recently wrote. <p> Kinky Friedman -- author. That 's taken a little getting used to. After all, anyone who knows the name is most likely to remember it as being connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were best known for wonderfully satiric, subversive tunes such as " Get Your Biscuits in the Oven( and Your Buns in Bed), " and the classic " They Do n't Make Jews Like Jesus Anymore. " <p> " Thank the Lord we were not a hit, " Friedman says, " or I 'd be at EuroDisney now performing with the Pips. " <p> Maybe. But the Texas Jewboys were perhaps the most worrisome country musicians of the ' 70s. Too weird and funny to make it in Nashville, they were also just too darn good to ignore. It 's no wonder Friedman picked up pals like Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson along the way. <p> Now history repeats itself with Kinky Friedman the writer. His books are n't going to end up on " Masterpiece Theatre " -- they 're too weird and loaded with asides like " mucous garcias " and " beauty is in the eye of the beerholder. " <p> But, obviously influenced by Arthur Conan Doyle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of the genre to be contenders. <p> The Kinkster 's latest, The Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover( Simon &; Schuster, $ 23), is being heavily hyped by the publisher, which hopes to break him out to a wider audience. <p> " After finally finding a lifestyle that does n't require my presence, I 'm in danger of losing my cherished cult status here, " he says. <p> " Here " is his fabled trailer in Kerrville, Texas. Deep in the hill country, it 's where he admitted he helped hide Abbie Hoffman when the Yippie leader was on the run. Now it is being overrun by an overzealous woman with a vacuum cleaner, three dogs, two cats and assorted armadillos. <p> " Yeah, we 've got a real ' Born Free ' experience happening here. Wait, damn it.... There 's a praying mantis on my guillotine. You know, my cigar cutter thing. " <p> He leaves the phone for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2s. <p> " You know, someone once asked me how I could support the Cuban economy. I said ' I 'm not, I 'm burning their fields. ' " <p> That 's the way it goes with the Kinkster. Mile a minute... you do n't know where you 're going, but the ride is pretty interesting. It can range from stories about playing with Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder tour and ruminations about why the male anatomy is better served by today 's swimwear to bitter attacks on Dean Koontz and appreciations of Georges Simenon. <p> He 'll even tell you about running for Kerrville 's justice of the peace in 1986. His campaign slogan : " If you elect me your first Jewish justice of the peace, I 'll reduce the speed limit to 54.95. " <p> With some not-so-gentle prodding, he gets back to the subject. <p> " Oh yeah. What were we talking about? " <p> In the new book, the Kinkster is hired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caper takes him dangerously from New York to Washington, D.C., to Chicago( where Friedman was born and lived briefly) and has more than a little something to do with Al Capone. Mystery fans will be satisfied by the chase, but fried Friedman fans will love all the asides and wry commentaries that dot the road. <p> Friedman says the books come naturally to him. <p> " It 's like falling off a horse, " he explains. " I just came blithering in through the back door of literature. I do n't know how I do these things. I 'm flying by Jewish radar, operating with total disregard for the reader. " <p>( Keep in mind that all previous and future quotes from Friedman have been cleansed of bushels of expletives. All belches, groans and unidentifiable aural objects are also gone.) <p> " I think this one is going to be a best seller here, " he continues. " It 's about time. The books are far better received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em ; I think they view ' em as some sort of commentary. Hell, at one time Tom Robbins was No. 2 on the South African best-seller list and I was No. 3. Now, how bad can a country be if that happens? But Americans have - - - - for brains. " <p> Friedman thinks his previous career and notoriety have worked against him. <p> " This is a second act, " he says. " People know me from the music. There are expectations. But if I was just some nerd out here, everybody would just think the books were good. " <p> Yet Friedman agrees that the mysteries are a continuation of what he 's always been up to. <p> " In a way, the mysteries are like a country song, " he says. " They afford resolution, and there 's so little of that in life. The hardest thing to do is write a good country song -- you need divorce and pain and drugs and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier, but Friedman still ca n't believe that he 's become a brand name at bookstores, of all places. <p> " I 'm in a major state of shock over my career. I mean, look at my peers : Commander Cody, Country Joe and the Fish, Norman Greenbaum. " He lets the thought dangle there. <p> " It 's hard for me to analyze because I 'm standing too close to the pyramids to appreciate my own beauty. " <p> Friedman has come a long way from the bitter end of his regular performing career. He had pretty much hit bottom -- too little success, too many drugs. <p> " Things were not going too well, " he remembers. " We were playing the Lone Star Cafe in New York. And one day Bob Marley came out of my left nostril and told me to stop taking drugs. Cocaine. I was feeling like Lenny Bruce and Judy Garland in their final days. <p> " Then I rescued this woman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It was 1985. Kinky was out to buy cigars in New York City when he saw a guy trying to stab a woman at an ATM machine in the lobby of a bank. He had the right bank card, stuck it in the door slot and saved the day. <p> He 's not exactly sure why, but Friedman views the whole episode as a " real road to Damascus experience. " It got him out of one lifestyle and on the way to writing. <p> Ironically, the woman he saved was none other than the notorious Cathy Smith, the woman who was with John Belushi when he died. <p> " I do n't know if that tarnished my hero status or what. " <p> Since then, he 's been at it constantly. There is already another book in the can. " I always say I 'm two years ahead of the reading public. " <p> The new one is called Road Kill and features the Kinkster on the road with Willie Nelson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lets out a phlegmy rumble of epic proportion. " That 's a device I use whenever the conversation drifts away from me to help bring it back. " <p> It works. <p> Having " conquered " two media, Friedman wonders when Hollywood is finally going to get around to turning his books into a series. <p> " The problem has always been who is going to play me. <p> " I see Meryl Streep.
