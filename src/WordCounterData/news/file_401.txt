3067841 <p> If you eat a premium piece of finfish in a top restaurant, chances are it will be one of three varieties - salmon, swordfish or tuna. All are large species that stay fresh during air freighting, have a reasonable shelf life for fish, offer distinctive flavors and textures, and respond well to the attention of a good chef. <p> Salmon is certainly the easiest to serve. It can benefit from any number of preparations - poached with hollandaise, grilled with fruit salsa, sauteed with red wine and mushrooms, or baked in parchment with aromatic fresh herbs and dry vermouth. <p> Swordfish is the most finicky. It needs to be impeccably fresh, cooked with care and sauced with restraint. A light grilling and a splash of lemon butter is all it needs. <p> But by far the trickiest is tuna. While it does n't shine to offbeat or aggressive seasoning, the simple treatment does n't usually work either. It needs equal measures of coaxing and respect. <p> Depending on the way it 's cooked - or overcooked - tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a tuna steak is cut very thin and well marinated, it can be cooked through and retain a modicum of moisture. However, most chefs these days choose to cook tuna pink or even slightly red in the center. A carefully prepared slab of medium-rare tuna has the same appeal as a juicy filet mignon. <p> The most common variety available in the Colorado market is yellowfin tuna. According to Blair Joyce of Northeast Seafood Products, Denver 's premier fish wholesaler, yellowfin accounts for nearly all the tuna his company handles. His source for the yellowfin is Hawaii( where it is also known as " ahi ") and the Gulf of Mexico. Occasionally he sells the smaller albacore tuna if he can source them from cool Hawaiian waters. The warm-water West Coast albacore flakes apart easily and, as far as Joyce is concerned, is suitable only for canning. <p> Home consumers can usually find pre-cut tuna steaks at the better supermarkets and fishmongers around town, but they do n't have the same choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can find on ice is what is called " No.2 " or " cooking grade " tuna. The color can range from opaque orange to a deep, translucent maroon. And, depending on which part of the loin it was cut from, it may have some stringy white fibers connecting the flakes of meat. <p> The better quality that is usually reserved for restaurants and sushi bars is called " No.1 " or " sashimi grade " tuna. This tuna should always be a deep crimson and have a perfectly translucent rather than milky look to it. It is de rigueur for sushi and sashimi, and preferred by better restaurants, which like to serve it very, very rare.( Rare No.1 tuna with sweet soy is one of the signature dishes at Cliff Young 's.) <p> When you select tuna at the supermarket, the trick is to find No.2 tuna that most closely resembles No.1. Look for the largest, most uniform-looking steaks, even if you have to cut them into two portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail, where the smaller steaks come from. Also look for tuna that is dark red, shiny and reflective. If it is n't shiny, that 's an indication that the tuna may have developed a mealy texture from age. <p> Below are two recipes for cooking-grade tuna followed by two recipes for sashimi-grade tuna.( The latter can be special-ordered through area Alfalfa 's Markets and other markets with a good fish selection.) <p> The first recipe is one I developed to take advantage of fresh tuna 's affinity for ginger. But the basic flavors - bacon, zucchini, balsamic vinegar and tomato - are Mediterranean rather than Asian. I really recommend getting tuna steaks that are at least 3/4-inch thick and cooking them medium rare. The mixture of ginger and bacon is odd, but just what Charlie needs. <p> If you want tuna that is cooked through, try the next recipe for thin steaks marinated in an Oriental tangerine marinade. They will just cook through and stay juicy if you serve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so many people crave these days. For these recipes, you 'll need to order the tuna in advance. The first is my interpretation of seared tuna tataki - a wonderful Japanese appetizer that is quite easy to prepare once you 've finished the shopping at an Oriental market. I 've served it several times to great reviews. <p> Finally, there 's a recipe for seared tuna with balsamic butter from Zenith chef Kevin Taylor. <p> GRILLED TUNA WITH <p> BACON-GINGER VINAIGRETTE <p> AND ROASTED SQUASH COMPOTE <p> Tuna : <p> 4 yellowfin tuna steaks( 6 to 7 ounces each) <p> Oven-roasted squash : <p> 1 large or two small zucchini <p> 1 large or 2 small yellow crookneck squash <p> 4 large roma tomatoes <p> About 1 tablespoon pure-grade olive oil <p> Splash wine or cider vinegar <p> Vinaigrette : <p> 6 slices bacon <p> 1 length( 2 inches) ginger, very straight and fresh <p> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme <p> 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic <p> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar <p> 2 tablespoons fresh oregano, lightly chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3/4 cup pure-grade olive oil <p> Pinch red chile flakes( optional) <p> Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste <p> Trim tuna steaks of any dark flesh or skin. Cover tightly and let rest at room temperature at least one hour. <p> Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash and dry the vegetables well. Pour a little olive oil in your hands and rub it all over the vegetables. Salt vegetables lightly and place on a baking sheet. Bake for about 50 minutes, turning once.( If you like firmer vegetables, as in the photo, bake for only about 30 minutes.) <p> Using a sharp knife, cut the length of ginger into a rough, four-sided log. You will lose more ginger than you would by peeling it, but it is important to have straight sides. If any skin remains between the sides, you may peel it with a small knife. Cut the log of ginger into 1/8-inch-thin lengthwise sheets. Turn the sheets on the side and cut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but they should be quite thin. <p> Cut the bacon strips into half-inch cross sections. Place in a medium skillet, sprinkle with thyme and granulated garlic, and fry over a medium-high flame, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon. When the bacon begins to color and stick to the bottom, add a tablespoon or so of tap water to deglaze the bottom. Continue frying, stirring frequently, until the bacon pieces are crispy and have turned an appealing brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain over paper towels on a plate. <p> Add the ginger matchsticks to the hot bacon fat and continue to cook over a medium-high flame, stirring frequently. Cook until the matchsticks are crispy and mostly pale brown in color. The larger ones may still be somewhat yellow in the center and not fully crisped - that 's OK. Remove with a slotted spoon and mix with bacon. <p> Drain fat out of pan and wipe out thyme, but do n't rinse. Add balsamic vinegar and oregano to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transfer to a non-reactive bowl. <p> Separate about one-third of the fried bacon-ginger mixture and crush with a mortar and pestle or chop finely with a knife.( Reserve the remainder for garnish.) Mix with vinegar in bowl. Add sugar and mustard and whisk well. Slowly add olive oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly. The vinaigrette should thicken and emulsify slightly. Season to taste with salt, pepper and optional chile flakes. <p> When vegetables are cooked, remove from oven and chop coarsely.( You can easily pull off and discard the tomato skins.) Combine in bowl with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. Add a splash of high-acid wine or cider vinegar to perk it up. You may also need an extra sprinkle of salt. <p> When ready to serve : Moisten tuna steaks with about 3 ounces of vinaigrette and salt lightly. Grill over very hot coals until medium-rare - about 2 to 5 minutes on each side depending on thickness of tuna and outdoor temperature. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of each plate. Place a tuna steak over each mound of compote. Slather one ounce or so of vinaigrette over tuna and sprinkle fried bacon and ginger over the top. Pass additional vinaigrette at the table. Serves 4. <p> Note : If you 're planning to follow this dish with a salad, use the remaining vinaigrette to toss with the greens. <p> TANGERINE TUNA <p>( From " Miami Spice " by Stephen Raichlen ; Workman) <p> Tuna : <p> 4 tuna steaks( about 1 1/2 pounds total), cut 1/4- <p> to 1/2-inch thick <p> Tangerine Marinade : <p> 1/4 cup soy sauce <p> 1/4 cup fresh tangerine juice <p> 4 strips( 1/2-inch each) tangerine zest <p> 3 tablespoons honey <p> 2 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil <p> 3 cloves garlic, minced <p> 2 scallions, trimmed and white part minced, green part finely chopped and reserved for garnish <p> 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger <p> 3 strips lemon zest( each 1 1/2 inches long) <p> 1 whole star anise <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds( preferably a mixture of black and white ; see note) <p> Preheat a barbecue grill to very hot. <p> Rinse the fish steaks and pat dry. <p> Whisk together all of the ingredients for the marinade in a shallow mixing bowl. Place the tuna steaks in a nonreactive baking dish and pour the marinade on top. Marinate the tuna, covered, in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes, turning the steaks once or twice. <p> Drain the tuna steaks and blot dry. Brush the steaks with the sesame oil. Grill the tuna for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until cooked to taste. Sprinkle the tuna with the chopped scallion greens and sesame seeds and serve at once. <p> Note : To toast sesame seeds, place them in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook, shaking the pan, until the seeds are aromatic( white seeds should turn a light brown), 1 to 2 minutes. <p> TUNA TATAKI <p>( Seared Tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds) <p> 1 daikon( Japanese radish) <p> 2 lengths( 2 inches each) fresh ginger <p> 1 bunch scallions <p> 2 lemons <p> 1 to 2 tablespoons wasabi paste, rehydrated according to instructions on tin <p> Ponzu dipping sauce( Japanese soy-citrus sauce) <p> Pickled pink ginger <p> Japanese purple eggplant and beefsteak pickle <p> Several whole lettuce leaves, such as red leaf <p> Attractive lettuces for garnish, such as radicchio, Belgian endive and field greens <p> The tuna loin will be roughly three-sided with skin along the longest side. Trim off the skin with a sharp knife and cut the tuna into three pieces : Two four-sided logs( about 1 1/2 by 1 1/2 by 6 inches) and one triangular piece. Rinse pieces and pat dry. Peel and finely grate half the daikon.( Use the small-medium holes on a box grater.) Set aside. Peel and grate one length of ginger( smallest holes on grater) ; set aside. Cut the scallions, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; divide into two portions. Rinse one portion of scallion in a wire-mesh strainer under cold running water. Press dry, wrap tightly in plastic film and refrigerate. Set the other portion aside. Slice one lemon in half. <p> Heat a heavy-bottomed( preferably cast iron) skillet over high heat until smoking hot.( If your pan is reasonably well seasoned, it should be dry. If not, wipe the bottom with a very little bit of vegetable oil.) Meanwhile, fill a high-sided baking pan or a cake pan two-thirds full of ice water. <p> Place the tuna pieces in the hot skillet and sear 1 minute on each side. If the tuna sticks to the bottom of the pan when you try to turn it, allow it to sear for an additional 30 seconds and it will deglaze itself. <p> When the tuna has achieved a beautifully dark, seared exterior on all sides, remove it from the pan and plunge immediately in the ice water. When cool, take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tuna on a large piece of plastic film. Coat each piece on all sides with the grated daikon, the grated ginger and the unrinsed scallions. Squeeze both sides of the cut lemon evenly over all three pieces. Wrap up the tuna pieces tightly.( This may be a little tricky because the grated daikon is wet - use another piece of plastic film if necessary.) Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours before serving. <p> When ready to serve, cut the other lemon into wedges and peel and grate the other length of ginger. Prepare the wasabi paste. Peel and shred the other half of the daikon.( Shred it in your food processor or with a vegetable peeler - do n't grate it.) Prepare a very large, beautiful platter of lettuces. Unwrap the tuna and cut pieces into 1/4-inch slices. Transfer the tuna slices( and the daikon-scallion-ginger mixture) to the serving platter. Arrange piles of pickles, wasabi, grated ginger, rinsed scallions and cut lemons around the platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small dish filled with ponzu sauce. <p> The guests may choose to flavor their ponzu with wasabi, grated ginger or scallion. Although the Japanese do n't usually serve wasabi with this dish, most Americans seem to prefer it. But do instruct your guests that fresh ginger and wasabi do n't mix well. The pickles and lettuces provide nice palate cleansers between bites. Serves 4 as a main course or 8 as an appetizer. <p> Any Alfalfa 's market will be able to special order this cut of tuna for you. <p> These ingredients are available at any grocer that stocks Japanese products.
