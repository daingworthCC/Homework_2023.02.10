3029441 <p> ENGLEWOOD, Colo. - Mike Shanahan enjoys a good game of chess. He started playing as a kid and continued through high school and college. As a longtime NFL assistant, he was known to have some serious, ongoing matches with other coaches and players. <p> Shanahan, however, has n't played chess since he became head coach of the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos four years ago. " It 's so time-consuming, " he says, " to go down and play chess for 2 1/2 hours. " <p> Instead, Shanahan 's time is consumed by weekly, on-field duels with opposing coaches. <p> He 's not alone in a profession that leaves little free time. Few outsiders realize the hours NFL coaches cram in studying videotape, poring over computer printouts and distilling other information, particularly each Monday and Tuesday, to devise a game plan for the upcoming weekend. <p> Shanahan 's relentless preparation has become a model for NFL coaching staffs.( He was nicknamed " Mr. Let 's Do It Again " by a former pupil, San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he 'll be put to the test as Denver prepares to play its fiercest rival, defending AFC West champion Kansas City, next Monday night at dreaded Arrowhead Stadium. <p> Quarterback John Elway says one of the biggest keys to the Broncos ' success is how prepared players feel once they board theflight to an opponent 's city. Says all-pro tight end Shannon Sharpe : " We 're going to know what you are doing, when you like to do it, why you like to do it. Mike refuses to put us into battle unprepared. " <p> After two days of intense planning Mondays and Tuesdays, Broncos coaches turn out a thick new playbook insert every week. It details everything from the team itinerary to each opponent 's tendencies on second-and-1 against the run. There are biographies, coverages, red-zone statistics showing what a team tends to do inside the 20-yard line and, of course, the scripted 15 plays with which to start the game. <p> Just as detailed is Shanahan 's self-designed, offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and clutches as a reference guide during games. Color-coded and broken into down and distance vs. every defensive formation, it even includes " must call " and " Mike 's reminders " categories. Circled are plays Shanahan especially wants to use in key situations. <p> Marathon men <p> " You talked to the right guy, " St. Louis Rams coach Dick Vermeil says of Shanahan as a source for coaches ' preparation. <p> Vermeil 's office, on the other hand, is the appropriate place to start when talking about marathon hours put in by NFL coaching staffs. As head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1976-82, Vermeil regularly worked until the early-morning hours -- sometimes as late as 6 a.m. -- to get game plans ready for the players ' return on Wednesdays. NFL players are off Tuesdays. <p> " It was stupid, " says Vermeil, who quit after the ' 82 season because of burnout. " It was way too much. " <p> Vermeil says he has cut way back since returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office anymore. Then again, Vermeil sometimes gets home at 1 a.m. And his players nearly staged a mutiny when he began the season with lengthy sessions on Fridays, usually one of the lightest days of the week. <p> " There is a point of diminished returns, " says 49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick, witness to some of the modern era 's most notorious coach-workaholics. McKittrick says Vermeil was the most intense. The two worked for the Rams in the early 1970s. " You 'd feel obligated to stay late just because he did, " McKittrick says. <p> In 20 years with the 49ers, McKittrick has also seen : George Seifert, as a defensive coordinator, hunkered down in a small office for days at a time ; Ray Rhodes, as a secondary coach, regularly arriving at 5 a.m. to break down tape ; and Jon Gruden, as an eager offensive assistant, showing up even earlier to computerize plays. <p> Gruden, a coach-of-the-year candidate in his first season leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. <p> " I 'm a morning guy, " says Gruden, who leaves the Raiders facility at 10 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays. <p> Green Bay Packers coaches begin position meetings -- studying specific positions, such as running back, for the next game --at 6 a.m. on Tuesdays. The Kansas City Chiefs start at 7:30. They usually leave between 10 p.m. and midnight. <p> Many teams have plush office space, with connecting conference rooms for coaches. Playbook diagrams once drawn by hand are done by computer. Video cut-ups also can be called upon at the touch of a finger. But coaches still watch reams of tape. After losing at Green Bay, for instance, 49ers coaches requested 18 half-hour beta cassettes to study last Tuesday. <p> At least they have a change in cuisine : When Seifert was the 49ers ' head coach, he was so superstitious that assistants ate the same meals on each particular night. Mondays was spaghetti ; Tuesdays, Chinese ; and so on. Usually, these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas. At best, coaches squeeze in an hour for a workout. Most live close by. <p> " I 'll walk to the restroom, " Gruden says when asked what kind of breaks he is able to take. <p> Seeking mismatches <p> Players, in turn, are usually given one morning of meetings --then their lunch hour -- to process all the information. With the Broncos, the sessions are ways for Shanahan 's staff to keep the defending champs challenged and not complacent. <p> " No, you ca n't have any dumb players, " says Shanahan, who sits in the back of the room and takes notes as coordinators teach the game plan on Wednesdays. " They do n't last very long. " <p> Shanahan and staff search for tendencies, breaking down opponents by personnel and schemes. His office is the nerve center ; a side door connects to meeting rooms, so assistants can pop in for advice. <p> Often, Shanahan works at his desk with a television monitor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously at the Broncos ' training complex. Behind him is a huge drawer, with his custom game-plan cards neatly filed according to opponent. Another television is to his right, with enough videotape to make Blockbuster proud. On a shelf to his left rests a pair of huge blue binders, stuffed with all his offensive plays. <p> Each week, Shanahan and his staff write up about 20 running and 70 passing plays. The plays might not be new, but the formations usually are different. Like chess, it 's all about mismatches. <p> " What we try to do is tell you, ' What is the personnel area, ' " Shanahan says. " ' Is there one guy who is n't as good as what we have?... If they are going to try to cover for that guy? Or, do we let that guy go one-on-one? ' If we 've got a chance to match our guys with one of their guys who is not as good, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unturned <p> The typical preparation schedule for the coaches of the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos : <p> -- Monday. Evaluate Broncos offense, defense and special teams by breaking down tape of the previous game. Get that information into the computer. Study opponents ' tendencies, by scheme and personnel. <p> -- Tuesday. Get playbook ready with position meetings, more tape study. Concentration this day will be on first and second downs. Also prepare play cards for use in practice the next day. <p> -- Wednesday. Go over game plan and opposing personnel with players. Teach new formations for running and passing games. On field, work on the basic game plan and first and second downs. At night, prepare short-yardage, goal-line and third-down plays and two-minute drills. <p> -- Thursday. Implement short-yardage, third-down packages. Review lessons from previous day. At night, prepare for red-zone( inside the 20-yard line) and two-minute drills. Also, begin laying out preparation for following week. <p> -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package. Afterward, prepare first 15 plays to be used on offense and defense. Tape study of next week 's opponent. Enjoy rare evening off. <p> -- Saturday. Implement first 15 plays on field. Afternoon off. At night, review entire package during meetings at team hotel, either on road or at home.
