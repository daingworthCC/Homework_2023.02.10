3052241 <p> An ideological rival is rushing to develop a nuclear arsenal. Threats and entreaties from the international community fall on deaf ears. Military options may be unacceptably risky. In the end, America is forced to accept the inevitable and deal with the consequences. <p> That 's the path the United States may have to follow with North Korea and Iran, in the view of many analysts. <p> But the United States has been down this road before, with the old Soviet Union, and with communist China. The road was long and often dark, but in each case the United States emerged safely -- the Soviets are no more, and China is seen as more of an economic rival than a nuclear threat. <p> There are differences, of course, but there also are lessons that the Cold War can offer today 's White House -- lessons some analysts say the White House seems to be taking to heart. <p> Marina Ottaway, a senior associate at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites what she calls a " telling quote " in President Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means keep doing what you 're doing. My attitude is, do n't do what you 're doing if it 's not working ; change. " <p> Bush was referring specifically to Iraq, but Ottaway saw it -- more fundamentally -- as " the closest he has ever come to preparing the public for a change in policy. " That change, Ottaway and other foreign policy analysts suggest, could entail a shift away from unilateral force and back to the hallmarks of Cold War diplomacy : containment and deterrence. <p> Those strategic concepts -- containing an aggressive power 's expansionist tendencies while encouraging internal reform and using the threat of military reprisal to deter the opponent 's use of force -- guided U.S. foreign policy for much of the past seven decades. They clearly are not the Bush administration 's first choice. <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said late last month that for Iran, at least, U.S. policy is to arrest that nation 's nuclear program in infancy rather than to deter it in maturity. But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The experience of the Cold War suggested that deterrence works, " said Andrew Bacevich, a professor of history and international relations at Boston University. " The great dilemma that we face now is trying to determine if deterrence will work against North Korea and Iran, and the dilemma hinges on our ability to determine whether or not those two regimes are rational. " <p> Many have said they are not, in part because of the public antics of their leaders : Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's religious visions and Holocaust denials, and North Korea 's Kim Jong Il with his passion for Hollywood movies and Dr. Evil-style leisure suits. But the leaders of the Soviet Union and China seemed similarly erratic when they first sought nuclear weapons, said Dan Reiter, a political scientist at Emory University. <p> " People thought that Mao Zedong was an ideologue, and people thought( Josef) Stalin was an ideologue, " Reiter said. " Mao was talking about the acceptability of nuclear war. He was talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But the fire-breathing rhetoric that regularly came out of the old Soviet Union and Maoist China did not translate into action. While North Korea 's true intentions are something of a mystery, Iran 's top mullahs, who hold the real power in the Islamic Republic, are far less adventurist than Ahmadinejad. <p> " The rationality of the Soviets and the Chinese is easier to see in retrospect than it was at the time, " Bacevich said. " Stalin was a paranoid lunatic in the clinical sense. But that did n't make the Soviet regime in the ' 40s and ' 50s irrational. " <p> Yet there are important differences between the Cold War nuclear states and the rogue powers of today. <p> Like the Soviets and Chinese before them, most analysts believe, Iran and North Korea are seeking a bomb at least in part to defend themselves against a U.S. military assault. But they are developing their arsenals in a very different era. <p> " In the Cold War, the world was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. " Both the Soviet Union and the United States, even though they disagreed on everything else, did n't want anybody else to acquire nuclear weapons. " <p> Neither was there the fear that, for example, a medium-size power like Iran might be tempted to share nuclear secrets or devices with non-state actors such as Hezbollah, or that North Korea might contemplate selling its technological know-how for desperately needed hard currency. <p> There are reports that the Pentagon is at least gaming a pre-emptive attack -- an idea that Air Force leaders contemplated against the Soviets in the ' 50s. But even conservative analysts shudder at that prospect, especially if it involves nuclear weapons. <p> " Preventative war is just not legal. You ca n't just attack somebody because someday they might be a threat to you, " said James Jay Carafano, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. <p> The United States, then, is faced with a familiar dilemma : While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are optimistic they will succeed, and the available military options seem similarly unlikely. <p> Supporters of a return to an older playbook point to specific examples -- <p> such as John F. Kennedy 's warning to the Soviets during the Cuban Missile Crisis that a nuclear attack on the United States from Cuba would be treated as an attack by the Soviet Union. The Soviets ultimately blinked first. <p> " That was wonderfully clarifying, " said Graham Allison, director of Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. " The analogue to that now needs to be... a very clear and credible articulation of a principle for North Korea that says if a bomb originates in North Korea, no matter whoever delivers it to the U.S. -- Osama -- or however they get it here, North Korea will be held accountable precisely as if North Korea attacked the U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile. " <p> At the same time, the threat posed by the new nuclear powers is far below the scale of the Cold War, noted Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Studies at Columbia University -- giving the United States more flexibility than recent rhetoric might suggest. <p> " Back in the Cold War, we were worried about World War III, in which in the space of a few hours, six or seven hundred million people would be dead, " he said. " The current threats are really piss-ant threats compared to that. " <p> The United States also has tools available to it today that did n't exist in the Cold War era, Carafano noted, such as sole superpower status, surveillance technology, anti-missile systems under development and diplomatic tools such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, an agreement between 66 countries to intercept illicit arms shipments. <p> However, modern deterrence and containment needs one more crucial element, <p> analysts say. <p> " You want a strong, unified, diplomatic effort, " Carafano said. " The results of that may not necessarily be that you influence the behavior of the bad guys, but... you show a unified face to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterrence. " <p> That element, a number of analysts said, may be part of the most important area of overlap between the Cold War and the modern era : the need for diplomacy, for talking, not only to American allies, but to American enemies. <p> " Again, go back to the Cold War and what we did. There was a lot more than just hoping it would not happen. There was a lot of diplomacy involved, " Ottaway said. <p> What 's more, Ottaway noted, the Cold War often involved the United States making concessions to its rivals -- from permitting cultural exchanges to negotiating reductions in arsenals -- despite fears of rewarding bad behavior that were debated then and have returned today in discussions over whether directly engaging Tehran and Pyongyang endorses their intransigence and repeats Europe 's failed appeasement policies of the 1930s. <p> " It 's an idea which at times has been invoked, that... you have to hold off talks until that group essentially has surrendered, " Ottaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have always been forced to talk to those people. " <p> While talking is anathema to advocates of " regime change, " Richard Haass, the former director of policy planning for the State Department during President Bush 's first term, notes that such a goal is not necessarily incompatible with the Cold War strategy of containment. <p> " Advocates of regime change generally reject most, sometimes any, dealings with the regime in question, lest the process of interaction or engagement somehow buttress the offending government, " Haass wrote in the August 2005 issue of " Foreign Affairs. " " Diplomacy is therefore marginalized, as it has been in U.S. Cuba policy for 40 years, and as it has been more recently in U.S. policy toward both North Korea and Iran.... Regime evolution, however, accepts the need for give-and-take.... In the end, the Soviet regime did change. " <p> The White House and others have noted the many efforts at dialogue in the past decades that led to naught, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue and their own commitments. <p> But in the absence of good options, it 's a strategy worth embracing, Betts said. <p> " I would rather bank on deterrence and containment as long as necessary, " he said. " It took us over 40 years with the Soviet Union, and nobody until the very end of the Cold War believed the Soviet Union was going to crack up and collapse -- but it did. " <p> What 's more, reducing the hostility between the United States and its newly nuclear rivals can, paradoxically, put those regimes on the defensive, Carafano said. <p> " In a sense, they need an enemy. That 's the problem here, " he said. " If North Korea has no enemies, how do they justify having a garrison state?... How do the radical elements in the Iranian government justify not giving people liberty, not growing the economy? " <p> That does not mean, of course, that success is guaranteed, the experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is a long-term competition, " Carafano said. " We need to think about it in terms of a competition, not a crisis. <p> " The weird thing about these regimes is they can hang on forever.... On the other hand, they could make a critical internal error and the whole thing will fall apart in a New York minute. "( 1) Mao,( 2) Stalin,( 3) Kim,( 4) Ahmadinejad
