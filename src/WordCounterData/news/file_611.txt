4135041 Democratic leaders should personally experience wonders of Obamacare Obamacare was written by, passed by, signed by and implemented by Democrats. If any private business spent three years and hundreds of millions of dollars and had this kind of rollout, heads would roll, and rightly so. However, Eugene Robinson says just give us three more years to see how this all works out( " Plenty of time to fix Obamacare, " Nov. 3). So nearly 10 million will lose their policies because they were substandard( in the administration 's opinion) and with just some " shopping around " will have better insurance at a lower cost. Many of these " better policies " have very high deductibles, and the premiums are not less for coverage not needed. I would suggest Robinson, Sen. Durbin, Sen. McCaskill, Obama, et. al, voluntarily drop their current insurance plans and shop on the exchanges so they, too, can experience the wonders of the Affordable Care Act. Charles Shelhamer Hillsboro, Ill. Need real leadership from Republicans on health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Obama administration 's " scheme " to force health insurance companies to cancel millions of existing policies. As usual, the outrage is running ahead of the facts. Turns out that many of these cancelled policies, perhaps the large majority, provided no real coverage. It 's true that for as little as $65 per month, a healthy young adult can purchase a policy. Those policy holders are often shocked to discover that their policies have annual benefit limits of as little as $1,000 or $2,000, not enough to cover a single night in a hospital. In fact, they are essentially uninsured when their need for coverage is the greatest. My friends on the right like to frame this issue in terms of liberties, rights, and the need for personal responsibility. Fair enough. How is it personally responsible to gamble with other people 's money? That 's exactly what is being done by anyone who refuses to carry adequate health insurance. Even young people do become seriously ill and do incur major injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninsured or underinsured, who picks up the tab for that treatment? You and I do, in the cost of everything we purchase from the health care market. Claiming to be covered by one of these basically worthless policies is as irresponsible as would be driving one 's car with a couple thousand dollars in liability coverage. The Affordable Care Act is the first serious attempt in our nation 's history to address the need for access to health insurance for all Americans. It is in fact a Republican proposal that has been adopted by the current administration. The law has flaws, which do need to be addressed. How refreshing would it be if Republicans would work with their Democratic counterparts to find remedies for those problems instead of ranting about bogus issues for partisan gain? That would be real leadership. Jim Shepard St. Louis News media team up for profit, and the public suffers Years ago, on one of his days off, my grandfather took me on a tour of the major baking company where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour, I got to see the entire baking process that began with a huge single-vat, bread-dough mixing machine. The most interesting, and illuminating, part of the entire **32;17444;TOOLONG process was the fact that the very same single batch of dough was used to bake three lines of locally competitive brands of bread with the " different " bread loaves packaged in separate major-brand plastic bread sleeves. Unfortunately, that same sort of process is evident in today 's news media. This can readily be seen every day with the evening TV news carbon-copy coverage displayed by NBC, CBS and ABC. In his column " A missed opportunity to instill rationality "( Nov. 4), Bill McClellan appears to have let the cat out of the bag on a similar local issue. Bill mentioned that while he was at Channel 9( KETC-TV), David Limbaugh - " writer and brother of the famous radio talker " - was " being taped for a network show of some kind. " Bill further noted that when he talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told that " It was a live taping for a Fox show. " It is bad enough that KETC-TV already displays corporate advertisements with every show. Such ads include those for corporate sponsors such as Monsanto. Previously we learned that the Post-Dispatch has entered into a partnership with the local Fox station. Now we also have to contend with the fact that, apparently, KETC is colluding with Fox, too! Given the fact that pervasively profiting privateers have perilously polluted the public airways, it 's long past time that they should be stripped of commercial interests and returned to public domain. Bob Soetebier St. Louis County Fast-food workers should not have to depend on the government Susan Feigenbaum from the Department of Economics at UMSL should get off her high horse and try a so-called low-skilled job in fast food( " Productivity of unskilled workers does not justify higher wage, " Nov. 3). Personally I would rather teach economics than stand over a hot grill for eight hours. Do n't get me started on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither particularly young nor teenagers. Many have worked in the industry a long time and deserve a living wage with decent benefits. There is no justification for these hard-working employees to depend on the government. Mary K. Brown Chesterfield Charities help mothers who choose not to abort their baby How pathetic, ironic and sad is the editorial cartoon in your Nov. 3 edition. How pathetic in its distortion of the motives and the charity of those who oppose the destruction of innocent babies in the womb, and of the love, compassion and assistance they provide for the mothers who are victims themselves of the abortion of their own child. There are many people and institutions who provide help for mothers facing difficult pregnancies. Let me focus on just one, the Catholic Church, because it and its faithful members are among the staunchest and most diligent of those who oppose the horror of abortion. At the same time, it is the leader in providing support for women who elect not to abort their baby. Free services for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional counseling, job search and housing assistance, financial help and parenting classes. Far from the monsters depicted in the cartoon, the people who fight the evil of abortion are in the forefront of those who assist anyone who needs help and chooses not to abort her baby. How ironic that the living, breathing baby in the cartoon would not have survived without the strength of its mother and the aid of those who cared enough to support her. Is the life of that baby of no consequence? Does the artist believe that the baby would have been better off had it been aborted? How sad that the Post-Dispatch, a paper that prides itself as professional, reasonable and caring, would provide a platform for a cartoon that so horribly distorts the truth. Truly sad.
