3040341 <p> In July 1989, Franklin County Probate Judge Nelson Casey fined Buford Derrick $ 440 for driving his orange Dodge pickup while drunk on Georgia 17, and let him keep his license. <p> It was a typical sentence - except that it was Derrick 's 20th conviction for drunk driving and the fifth time a judge gave the Lavonia lumber worker permission to stay on the road. <p> The law allowed the judge to treat Derrick leniently because it had been 5 1/2 years since his last drunk-driving offense, long enough that his record was legally clear. <p> But Judge Casey might have remembered that Derrick had been in his courtroom on drunk-driving charges five times before. He did n't. He could have asked about Derrick 's prior driving record - he acknowledged later it would have been " very interesting to the court " - but he never did. <p> " It would never cross my mind a person could be that violent, " he explained. <p> On the books, Georgia 's drunk-driving statutes sound strict, with " mandatory " penalties for each offense. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from police officers to community leaders - complain they misuse it. <p> Derrick, for example, has never been sentenced to a single day in jail or placed on probation for any of his 20 drunk-driving convictions since 1972. <p> Each judge in every one of Georgia 's 775 courts that hear traffic and drunk-driving cases has his own sentencing philosophy, and decisions can vary widely even among judges in the same courthouse. <p> A review of 752 drunk-driving cases involving Buford Derrick and 42 other Georgia motorists with 15 or more drunk-driving convictions, as well as interviews with dozens of judges and experts, revealed huge discrepancies in sentencing across the state. <p> A few practices, however, are common : <p> Georgia judges are not required to accept a plea of nolo contendere, or no contest, to a first drunk-driving offense. But in 1990 they accepted such pleas, which allow convicted drivers like Derrick to continue to drive, in more than half the 61,622 cases involving first offenders, according to Department of Public Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation, and even fewer behind bars. Ten of the state 's 43 worst drunk drivers have been sentenced to a total of less than one year in jail. Of the 77,443 first and second offenders convicted in Georgia last year, fewer than 15,000 were assigned to probation, Corrections Department records show. Seventy- eight were sent to state prison. Thousands of others were sentenced to short terms in local jails, but since there is no central record of the state 's jail population, it is impossible to tell how many. <p> Georgia judges rarely order drunk drivers into alcohol treatment programs. An analysis of the 752 sentences given to Georgia 's worst drunk drivers showed that judges mandated some form of treatment for alcoholism only 13 times, even when the defendants ' records had grown to 15 or more convictions. <p> Many judges also permit drunk-driving cases to be postponed for up to a year or more, which experts say undermines the deterrent effects of a swift punishment. ; 1st offense ' often not first <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to some degree a reflection of the pervasiveness of drunk driving in society, some judges and experts said. Yet it is startling, they said, given research indicating that, on average, a motorist is likely to be caught only once for every 1,000 times he 's drunk on the road. <p> " The fact of the matter is the first offense ' is not the first offense, " said Thomas Enright, Southeast regional director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. " It 's the first conviction. " ; Girl 's death haunts judge <p> Judge Harold G. Benefield of the Clayton County State Court is one of a few judges who take that into account. <p> Still haunted by a 1988 crash in which a drunk driver he had sentenced to probation killed a 12-year-old girl, Judge Benefield has formulated a unique sentencing grid. <p> He assigns points for eight risk factors, from how high the driver 's blood-alcohol level was to how many times he has been convicted of drunk driving over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence. <p> Judge Benefield said he will accept a nolo plea only from the most pristine first offender, and even a true first offender with a few speeding tickets will serve 12 months on probation. <p> Yet Judge Benefield believes sentencing drunk drivers is far more complicated than his grid. <p> " It 's tempting to say 12 months in jail. Go away. ' But every judge has to consider all the victims in the case - wives, children, mothers, fathers, employers and fellow taxpayers, " who suffer and pay as well, he said. " It 's not that easy - if you care. " ; Free by day, jailed by night <p> Rockdale County State Court Judge Sidney Nation has a reputation for being one of the toughest on drunk drivers in the state, but he finds himself in a similar predicament. <p> " I 've got 35 or 40 of the worst drinkers in our county under control at night, " he said. He 's ordered them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regular jobs during the day. " When you take that many bad drinkers off the road, you can make an impact. " <p> But Judge Nation has a soft side. When he hears the case of a drunk woman who wrecked while taking her husband to the hospital for an appendicitis attack, or of a drunk father who picked up his daughter on the side of the road after she 'd been dumped by her boyfriend, or of a military officer summoned for duty in the middle of a night on the town, he is lenient. They all got a minimum punishment. <p> " That 's the art, " he explained, " picking who needs what sentence. You do n't automatically go to jail. You 're in trouble. But if you can convince me you 're not going to do it again or if you 've got a good excuse - all that gets taken into consideration. " ; They 're gon na do it ' <p> In some other Georgia courts, judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix the drunk-driving problem. <p> At the Atlanta Traffic Court on a recent Wednesday morning, 31 drunk drivers paraded in front of Chief Judge Joe Browne. <p> Nearly every time, Judge Browne ordered " $ 600 and 12 months, 12 months suspended on payment. " Only those who ca n't come up with $ 600 actually go to jail. <p> " They could make the punishment a public whipping at Five Points and it would not dissuade one person, " said the solicitor in the courtroom, Michael White, a 20-year veteran of the system. " They 're gon na do it as long as there 's alcohol and cars. "
