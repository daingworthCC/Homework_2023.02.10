3072041 <p> Today 's film fanatics, the ones who buy DVDs of high-definition directors ' cuts and study all the extras, are sticklers for vividness, crisp borders and high color. In this way, these aesthetes may have something in common with the rugged heroes of Hollywood 's great westerns, those austere individualists who also prize clarity. This should n't be surprising. Film and frontier have always gone together. Formally, they 're kin. <p> Sententious Hollywood dialogue, for example, thrives in close-ups and two-shots of horsemen -- enemies, brothers, amorous ranch hands -- tall in the saddle, panoramically alert and haloed by spacious skies. Riders who mean what they say, and often say what they 're doing, are the boon companions of screenwriters looking to advance simple plots. <p> Consider an early scene in the TV miniseries " Comanche Moon, " the coming prequel to the 1989 series " Lonesome Dove, " based on Larry McMurtry 's series of novels. Two Texas Rangers, charged with containing the Comanches of the title, survey a valley of teepees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Thur 's a lot of Indians down thur, Captain Scull, " one says. <p> The other replies : " Well, do n't be tempted by them, Mr. Call. They 're the wrong Indians. " <p> Got all that -- the names, the heroes and villains, the complication, the landscape? The movie even furnishes a pause for the audience to fully absorb what it has heard. Nice. Conversation that so obligingly informs viewers about the coming plot line just does n't take place in drawing rooms. <p> Then there 's the cinematography. Westerns are tailor-made for wide shots. Sweeping panoramas of the great square states( played by Italy or western Canada sometimes, sure) have long been used to show off technological innovations. Westerns helped CinemaScope and VistaVision make their debuts in the ' 50s, and in 1959 RCA openly sought to sell its new N.T.S.C.-color TV sets by producing " Bonanza " in what was advertised as " living color. " <p> And now we have digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are showcased especially well in classic westerns that have been digitally polished. But do n't look for subtle hues in the new DVDs ; when it comes to the good-and-evil cowboy palette, smart eyes are on the glare of the sun and the depth of the shadow. As videophiles begin to surpass even hi-fi-era audiophiles in the zeal of their precision-appreciation, dozens of online forums have been convened to parse the high-def virtues of DVDs like the recently remastered John Ford film " The Searchers. " In one review of " The Searchers " in HD, Herb Kane of Critic Doctor showed special reverence for what he called the " dimensionality " of the film 's " sage, the pebbles and rocks and the various mountainscapes. " <p> Respect for stark contrasts -- visual, moral -- may in fact make today 's videophiles the ideal audience for westerns, just as audiophiles were once the ideal audience for recorded jazz. Of the remastered version of the 1957 version of " 3:10 to Yuma, " which Sony released in August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn Abel of DVD Spin Doctor wrote : " The high, hard contrasts pop off the screen. At times, the actors look unworldly, like specters in a dreamscape drained of color. In close-ups, their Bible-black eyes can look like those of aliens or demons. " <p> Though western heroes are often thought of as throwbacks hostile to newfangled technological developments( preferring spurs and canteens), photography is actually the cowboy 's most loyal sidekick. From daguerreotypes to cigarette ads, the rugged folk of the West have rarely declined to sit for portraits. And just as the conservationist PBS series " Nature " relentlessly pushes Canon 's digital cameras -- with their easily uploadable and e-mailable photos and colors that suspiciously " pop " -- so the western film suggests that you might holster your camera, take off for photogenic lands and not forfeit your credibility on the trails. <p>( Actually, you could take a laptop too. The History Channel 's edifying series " Wild West Tech, " which plays frequently in reruns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier wizardry, from sophisticated beaver traps to the Springfield-Allin breech-loading rifle, giving the lie to idea that frontiersmen were ever Luddites.) <p> At the same time, in the face of an F.C.C. edict that will terminate all analog broadcasting in 2009 -- the so-called " analog sunset " -- a wild bunch of television fans are also insisting on a retro aesthetic : old color shows on old color sets. Those who appreciated the turquoise and lipstick red of the early sets, which used different phosphors than later color televisions, have clustered online. On YouTube, a poster called TeslaMaster has gone so far as to upload a video of a restored 1956 RCA television showing an episode of " Bonanza. " One catch : the online video is, of course, digitized ; to catch " Gunsmoke " or " Bonanza " as they would have appeared in the 1950s, you 'll need to restore an old RCA set yourself. <p> To further combine the raptures of technology with those of the open plain, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broad and intensely loyal followings. A Dutch-language site about horses, bokt.nl, is one of the world 's biggest message boards, with more than 30 million posts. And Equitrekking, a video-sharing site that augments a high-def TV series from PBS of the same name, shows riders in Stetsons touring the world on horseback. Against spectacular backdrops, the horses do everything from gallop to ford rivers to ride herd. Who does n't want to watch that? <p> People who want land disputes and shootouts, that 's who. For real westerns in lush widescreen formats, the DVD of " Broken Trail, " Robert Duvall 's 2006 AMC miniseries, hits the spot. Duvall, who starred in " Lonesome Dove " 18 years ago, pulls off distracted frontier violence with both brio and solemnity. " Into the West, " Steven Spielberg 's six-part history lesson that appeared on TNT in 2005, is also on DVD. Both of these are better than " Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comanche Moon " is also worth a look when it starts on Dec. 30, though spending six hours with cowboys who are even grudgingly hospitable to cliches has momentary lows. And some of the digitally tampered landscapes look simply surreal -- more Middle Earth than big-sky country. <p> David Milch 's abortive masterwork, " Deadwood, " which ran for three seasons on HBO before being abruptly canceled last year, is better than all of the above put together. Every episode is on DVD and available in HD. In place of the old aphorisms and violin-heavy scores of the classic westerns, Milch substitutes barks, grunts, yawps, grandiloquence, the odd sequence spoken in Cornish and noises too obscene to name. It 's a glorious cacophony. <p> Seen on a high-def set, " Deadwood " reveals a broad tableau of miniature details so precise that they 're dizzying -- like seeing the world through binoculars and a microscope at once. The media critic Douglas Rushkoff has gone so far as to cite the HD " Deadwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heralding the death of television, arguing that cowboys rendered in excessive detail are harder to embrace than their blurrier, iconic forebears. The vulnerabilities and flaws that come through in HD 's hyperrealism -- abraded skin, ridges of makeup, stray spit -- may be incompatible with myth-making, which, he argues, demands softer focus. <p> What will be lost in the digital age? Maybe everything? Detail as the enemy of romance : it 's a lonesome thought. <p> Points of Entry <p> TECH THEORY 1.0 : The cultural critic Leo Marx, who was born in 1919 and is still on the faculty of M.I.T., opened the book on the question of technology in the American landscape. With his magnum opus, " The Machine in the Garden : Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America "( 1964), he may also have closed it. See for yourself in the 1999 Oxford University Press edition( with an afterword by the author). <p> YOU HAVE N'T LIVED : Martin Scorsese says that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a giant screen, then you pretty much have n't seen it at all. Ca n't rent a theater or restore an old projector and score an original print? Try Warner 's gloriously remastered version, available on DVD. <p> HORSEY SET : Sunset.com and Equitrekking.comput the spirit of the West online, with video, maps, photos and tales of equine heroism. Happy trails. <p> #
