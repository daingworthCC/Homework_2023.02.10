5019641 <p> LINCOLN -- A terrible start, a giant deficit, a technical foul, a comeback and a court storming. <p> Saturday 's Iowa Athletic Conference tournament championship had all that as Nebraska Wesleyan rallied from an 18-point deficit with 11 minutes to go to beat Central 82-78. The win guarantees the Prairie Wolves( 24-3) a spot in the Division III NCAA tournament. The 64-team field will be announced at 11:30 a.m. Monday. <p> " I ca n't put it into words, " Wesleyan senior and Omaha Benson graduate Deion Wells-Ross said as a recently trimmed net hung around his neck. <p> Wesleyan coach Dale Wellman 's arms-flailing conversation with an official drew a technical just before Central grew the lead to 63-45 with 10:54 to go. He delivered just as blunt a message to his team during a timeout. <p> " I said, ' I 'm upset, or you guys upset? '? " Wellman said. <p> Omaha Creighton Prep graduate Nate Schimonitz scored 15 of his 31 points in those final 11 minutes, but his pass to Jack Hiller with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Nate Bahe deflected a pass to Schimonitz, who darted upcourt and found Hiller open on the wing. Hiller had been 1 of 5 on 3-pointers, but his swish gave the Prairie Wolves a 76-74 lead. <p> " That was arguably the biggest shot of the game. He 'd been struggling, so we loved that he hit the big shot, " Schimonitz said. <p> Bahe scored on a layup with 49 seconds to go, giving Wesleyan a three-point lead, and the Prairie Wolves sealed the win with four free throws in the final 14 seconds. Then the entire student section emptied onto the court. <p> Such a celebration seemed unimaginable much of the night. <p> Wesleyan, which averages 97 points a game, missed its first eight shots. Central used a 13-0 run in the first half to build a lead it would hold until Hiller 's 3. <p> " We played pretty bad the first 30 minutes, " said Ryan Garver, who scored 14 points. <p> It was an all-too-familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's IIAC regular-season championship, only to lose 85-63 at home to a Central team it had twice beaten that season. <p> " They were up 18 last year and we folded, " Garver said. <p> Central( 12-16) was in position to win its third road game in five days, but made one shot in the last 7:28. <p> " We could n't get stops the last eight minutes, and they got to the foul line. We got tentative against their zone, " Central coach Craig Douma said. " They can do a lot of damage in the NCAA tournament. They have five guys that can shoot like guards, and they have length and size. " <p> Wesleyan overcame an off night for leading scorer Cooper Cook, who had 12 points and fouled out with 3:42 to go. <p> " I wish it had been more of a blowout, but this might be good for us, " Schimonitz said. " We have n't had a close win like this in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room, where Wellman was doused with water. <p> " Should I take my glasses off? " he asked assistant Trevor Johnson, who shrugged his shoulders and documented the moment on his cell phone. He emerged minutes later, glasses still on, and his black sports jacket spattered and soaked. <p> Three linemen, two superstar skill talents and one top national prospect who can live in the line and skill universes -- not to mention throwing a shot put a half-mile. The 2017 World-Herald Super Six was n't among the hardest to pick, but it 's easily among the best in recent years. <p> It was a historic volleyball season for Omaha Skutt, and the same could be said for SkyHawks coach Renee Saunders. She 's the first former World-Herald Nebraska high school athlete of the year to receive the newspaper 's high school coach of the year honor. <p> He 's the first athlete of the year from Beatrice since Bob Hohn in 1960.

She was the libero on an undefeated, nationally ranked volleyball team, the point guard on a winning basketball team and the leading scorer on the Class B state championship soccer team. <p> The records listed are taken from World-Herald archives, files from the Nebraska School Activities Association not updated since 2009 and a limited response seeking school records from coaches in the state. <p> It was a cold day for an outdoor photo when our All-Nebraska first-teamers gathered for a picture outside Joslyn Castle. But the players toughed it out. They were a cut above all season when talent was plentiful on high school basketball courts in Nebraska. This was n't the only time they sho... <p> It was the most successful volleyball season ever at Omaha Skutt, and two seniors, Brooke Heyne and Alli Schomers, helped make it so.

They were easy choices as honorary captains of The World-Herald 's 96th All-Nebraska team. <p> After all the ballots were cast, it was clear who the winners were in the voting for the 24th World-Herald All-Nebraska softball team. In this hectic election season, it was refreshing to endure limited lobbying and primarily positive comments from coaches about players as this campaign wrap... <p> Akin-Otiko is honored as the 2016 World-Herald Nebraska high school girls athlete of the year.
