3034841 <p> The message was on Billy Lange 's cell phone, waiting for him as he wearily boarded a bus for the long trip back to Annapolis from West Point three Sundays ago. Lange had just suffered through the worst loss of his nascent career as Navy 's basketball coach, watching his team miss shot after shot in a humiliating 63-43 loss to an Army team that was 2-14 entering the game. <p> " Hang in there, " the message said. " I know how tough losses like this are. Call me if you want to talk. " <p> The message was from someone who actually does know about tough losses : former Navy coach Paul Evans. Eighteen games into his first season at Navy, Lange decided to take him up on his offer. He called. He wanted to talk. As frustrating as his team 's shooting had been, the fact that the Midshipmen had given up 63 points to a team averaging fewer than 40 a game in the Patriot League was even more disturbing. <p> " I feel like we need to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've tried, it we lose our aggressiveness, we get passive. Our aggressiveness is our strength. " <p> When Evans coached at Navy in the 1980s, he played a lot of zone defense, funneling shooters to David Robinson. Lange does n't have anyone remotely resembling Robinson on his team, but he has boyhood memories of the teams Evans coached. They began talking about how to play zone and stay aggressive. <p> " I need to see what you 're talking about, " Lange said. " Can we get together? " <p> A couple of days later, Evans, 59, and Lange, 33, sat down at Chick &; Ruth 's, the famous downtown Annapolis deli that has been the hangout for the Maryland political crowd for years. Once, Gov. Marvin Mandel held court there over breakfast in the same booth every morning. Now, it was Evans holding court -- or at least drawing up defenses that could be used on a basketball court. <p> When Lange arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls were to ex-Navy coaches : Don DeVoe, who had just retired after 12 years at the academy, and Evans, who won more than 20 games each of his last three seasons at Navy, including a 30-5 record in 1985-86 en route to the NCAA tournament 's final eight. He went from there to Pittsburgh, where he won two Big East titles and went to five NCAA tournaments only to get fired in 1995 because of a personality clash with his athletic director. He has lived in Annapolis since then, working as a volunteer coach at Gonzaga High School until last year and selling real estate. <p> " I knew I wanted to talk to Coach DeVoe because he had come into one of the toughest jobs in the country and won a lot of games, " Lange said. " I remembered watching his teams when I was a kid, especially their win over Cleveland State in the Meadowlands in the Sweet 16 in ' 86. I remembered Robinson, of course, but they also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I thought if I could get players like that, we could be very good in the Patriot League. " <p> Evans and Lange got together and talked business -- basketball and real estate. Evans ended up selling Lange his house. Then they moved on to basketball. Last spring, Evans decided against succeeding his friend Dick Myers at Gonzaga. As a result, he 's had a lot more time this season to watch Navy play. <p> " Since he 's here I wanted him to be part of the program again, " Lange said. " As a young coach, if you have a basketball mind like that around and you do n't reach out to him, you are n't real smart. " <p> The day after the Army loss, Lange and Evans sat at Chick &; Ruth 's along with Lange 's assistant, Joe Burke, and watched and listened as Evans drew diagrams and talked. <p> " What he showed us was n't all that complicated, " Lange said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kids to extend the defense on the perimeter, get to shooters and make us more aggressive. When I heard what he was saying, I thought it was something we could put in during a couple of practices and use that week. " <p> The most aggressive form of zone in college basketball is the matchup zone that John Chaney has made famous at Temple. With Lange 's Villanova background, he was very familiar with the matchup and had already seen it in the Patriot League because Lafayette 's Fran O'Hanlon plays an almost identical defense. The matchup has a lot of man-to-man principles in it -- following cutters to the basket rather than simply handing a cutter off to another defender coming to help on the inside. What Evans was suggesting was more of a pure zone -- let the cutters go, but with the notion of getting out on shooters so as not to turn passive playing a more standard 2-3 zone. <p> " I thought it would fit the personality that worked best for us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow us to go deeper into our bench because we did n't have to worry about guys coming in and struggling to match up man-to-man. " <p> Four days later, with Colgate in town, Lange unveiled his team 's new defense, playing it for almost half the game. The Midshipmen won going away. Two days later, playing the zone for almost the entire game, they stunned Bucknell, a team that was in first place in the Patriot League and has victories at Saint Joseph 's and Pittsburgh this season. Last weekend, the Mids almost upset Holy Cross( losing 68-66) and then avenged the Army loss, 84-69. <p> " There 's no question the defense gave us a spark, " Lange said. " It 's amazing to me how many people seem to have forgotten what a great coach Paul was. " <p> Evans built three programs with losing basketball traditions -- Division III Hamilton, Navy and Pitt -- into big-time winners. He was only 49 when he left Pitt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last 10 years, Evans has not. He has applied for jobs everywhere from Georgia State to Sacramento State to no avail. <p> " I would still love to coach again, " he said. " But it 's a lot tougher at 59 than 49 to get hired. I think part of my problem is that I never had a mentor in the college game, someone who could make that one phone call that would get the attention of an AD or a president. It 's been frustrating but at this point in my life I 've learned to just take it as it comes. " <p> He has built a solid real estate business in Annapolis and this fall bought a delicatessen there. He and his wife, Mary Lou, live near the water and the boat that Evans kept docked on the waterfront even when he was coaching at Pitt. So, in all, it is a good life. But coaches such as Evans do n't climb the heights without passion for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was why he kept making the drive down Route 50 to coach at Gonzaga. <p> " Mary Lou always said that basketball does n't fund our life anymore but it many ways it still rules our life, " he said with a laugh. <p> Now though, 19 years after he coached his last game at the Naval Academy -- a loss in the East Region final to Duke -- Evans has again contributed to the school that gave him his first chance as a coach in Division I. " I will always have a warm spot in my heart for Navy, " he said. <p> And Navy should have a warm spot for him. Evans was 34 when he got the job at Navy, two years older than Lange was when he was hired last spring. He remembers what that was like. For that, Lange is eternally grateful.
