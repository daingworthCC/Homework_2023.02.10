3026241 <p> Put on a happy face. The fall TV season is coming, with 27 new series. You could die laughing. Or trying. <p> At a time when business could n't be worse for the networks - lower audience shares, defections to cable or video or( imagine) other pastimes - they 're meeting adversity with a fixed grin, asking us to smile along. <p> Well, we 'll try. What choice is there with more sitcoms on the schedule than ever : 55 in all, if you count reality/video comedy. Even the dramas are funnier. <p> Gone is the ex-con angst that earned James Earl Jones an Emmy for ABC 's Gabriel 's Fire. Now he 'll team with Richard Crenna in the lighter Pros &; Cons. Sharon Gless ' Rosie O'Neill also wo n't be as mopey. She 'd better lighten up. CBS has put The Trials of... opposite Cheers. <p> In new series, NBC has Eerie, Indiana, a kid's-eye Twilight Zone played for giggles. CBS is harking back to the light-intrigue Hart to Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their telegenic sleuths mutually attracted. <p> What season is this? It 's any-season. From the early ' 80s, perhaps. Or maybe the ' 70s. Did n't anybody tell the networks they do n't have a captive audience anymore? <p> This new crop is television without vision, unless you add the word " tunnel. " <p> Just a year ago, innovation was the watch cry. The tried and true was dead and buried, we were told. <p> Innovation flopped. CBS ' quirky sensation Northern Exposure - neither conventional comedy nor drama, accessible and likable yet loaded with esoterica - is either a happy fluke or a ray of hope. <p> Judging from what 's on tap this fall, it 's a fluke. This is not a brave new world, but one programmed with a cautionary, fearful eye on the bottom line. If at first they did n't succeed they tried tried again. <p> Network execs have reliable arguments why the stimulating likes of thirtysomething and China Beach and Shannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing " reality " crime genre make economic sense, are easier to watch and to get used to. Safe TV. <p> Some blame viewers, with itchy remote-control trigger fingers and TV- trained short attention spans. <p> The downside is that few shows conceived for fall have the nervy creative energy, the conviction of personal vision, that might make the fickle sit down and take notice. Further drift is being encouraged. <p> If any new series sums everything up, it 's NBC 's romantic crime thriller with Marlee Matlin and Mark Harmon. Not because of its content, but its title : Reasonable Doubts. <p> Breakout hits look to be in short supply - again - but that does n't mean there are n't some diamonds, or at least rhinestones, in the rough. The best of the least : <p> - Roc( Fox, Sundays at 8 : 30, all times p.m. EDT/PDT). Already airing, this winning sitcom about a garbageman( Charles Dutton) who dreams of a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vulgar grown-ups. <p> - Brooklyn Bridge( CBS, Fridays at 8 : 30). Scripts have circulated of Gary David Goldberg 's( Family Ties) loving sitcom remembrance of his cramped, nurtured childhood in late- ' 50s Brooklyn. Bearing the same stamp of nostalgic autobiography as Neil Simon 's Brighton Beach trilogy, this show is as yet sight unseen. But it plays great on paper, as did Evening Shade last year. Like that show, this may be a slow build on Fridays. <p> - Eerie, Indiana( NBC, Sundays at 7 : 30). A rare stylistic breakthrough, this half-hour spook-com sees a calm Midwest town through the wide eyes of a 13-year-old who 's convinced Eerie is farther out than anyone realizes. Next door to Hell, actually. The pilot, about a family that stays forever young through life-sized Tupperware, is a stitch. <p> Drawback : NBC is stacking it against 60 Minutes and pairing it with the year 's arguably worst new series : The Adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles disc jockeys. <p> - I 'll Fly Away( NBC, Tuesdays at 8). Before Northern Exposure, its creators gave us A Year in the Life. This family drama -- is closer to that, unspooling sometime in the late ' 50s somewhere in the South, with Sam Waterston a prosecutor raising three kids alone as society changes around them. Racial undercurrents inform this high-quality show. It has problems( Kathryn Harrold as an anachronistic lawyer), but integrity is n't among them - not that integrity sells these days, especially in Matlock 's old and too- early time slot. <p> Otherwise, a mixed bag. <p> Comedies continue to be overrun by achingly cute kids, including Redd Foxx 's much-touted return in CBS ' The Royal Family, and ABC 's Home Improvement, a favorite of advertisers that stars comic Tim Allen as a TV fix- it personality whose macho front ca n't redeem him at home. A one-joke show, albeit a funny joke. <p> NBC 's The Torkelsons, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its depiction of an eccentric and poor Arkansas family, is nothing special, but at least offers warmth - which is more than can be said for ABC 's Step by Step, a Brady Bunch for the ' 90s with Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers as the harried newlywed parents. <p> Their kids snipe at each other, hug by the end ; 100% synthetic, Step is a perfect fit in ABC 's Friday night and will probably run forever. Among all new shows, it best symbolizes this sorry, silly season. <p> For the grown-ups, Carol Burnett returns to CBS for an hour of comedy- variety, and James Garner gets an NBC sitcom as a con-man on the city council, in Man of the People. <p> Targeted to women : CBS ' Princesses, with Twiggy, Julie Hagerty and the caustic Fran Drescher as roommates. They 're cool, but the pilot is a contrived stinker. Yet unseen is ABC 's Sibs, a relationship comedy starring Marsha Mason as one of three sisters. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created two comedies unrivaled for bad taste : NBC 's Nurses, with an overdose of bedpan humor ; and ABC 's Good &; Evil, a mean-spirited serial with hateful characters( including miscast Teri Garr) and pained slapstick like a blind man trashing a lab full of glass beakers. <p> Are there trends? Of course. <p> - Nostalgia. Besides the comebacks of Garner, Burnett and Foxx, there are retro concepts( escapist and insipid comedy-drama like CBS ' P.S.I. Luv U) and shows set in bygone decades : Brooklyn Bridge, I 'll Fly Away and Homefront, a sudsy ABC drama about the days after World War II, when boys came home from the war. <p> - Downscaling. Fewer TV heroes lead posh lives in this recessionary season, as with the struggling sitcom families of Roc and Torkelsons. Even Dynasty, back on ABC as a four-hour miniseries, has put a limit on the bugle beads. <p> - Babies. On returning series, it 's a parent trap. Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Candice Bergen 's Murphy Brown is already( presumably) expecting, ditto Susan Dey 's Grace on L.A. Law. Babies are on the way for Full House and even Married... With Children, while Evening Shade and Life Goes On handed out cigars last season. <p> This vogue makes sense. Only with our returning favorites is there truly a sense of great expectation. CUTLINE : ' BROOKLYN BRIDGE ' : Marion Ross plays outspoken grandmother Sophie in CBS ' gentle comedy set in the ' 50s. CUTLINE : ' EERIE, INDIANA ' : Omri Katz, left, and Justin Shenkarow are adrift in a world far more weird than adults realize it is. CUTLINE : ' STEP BY STEP ' : Patrick Duffy and Suzanne Somers, far left, as newlywed parents in the ABC sitcom that 's the ' Brady Bunch ' of the ' 90s. CUTLINE : ' I 'LL FLY AWAY ' : Sam Waterston and Regina Taylor, at left, are caught in the turmoil of civil unrest and changing social values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES DUTTON : Stars in Fox 's refreshing ' Roc '
