3031641 <p> To understand John Rogers, manager of the Ariel fund, the past 12 months ' top-performing USA TODAY All-Star mutual fund, all you need are two words : Markel Corp. <p> Markel is an insurance company. A niche one, to be sure. But an insurance company nevertheless. <p> Like many of Ariel 's holdings, it 's smallish, dullish, underfollowed and underappreciated. Sooner or later, Rogers figures, the stock 's price will reflect Markel 's true value -- at which point Rogers will sell to someone else. <p> Ariel 's corporate logo is the tortoise, homage to the slow and steady turtle that beat the hare in Aesop 's fable. <p> Last year, conservative, value-oriented tortoises like Ariel crushed the aggressive, growth-seeking hares in the All-Star lineup. That 's a huge change from the 1990s, when all was glitz and glamour and tech. <p> " Every time you talked about the stocks you were interested in, eyes would glaze over, " Rogers says. <p> No more. Ariel Capital Management is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tables might be turning. He 's having a tough time finding stocks to buy. " No one investment style wins forever, " he says. <p> If he 's right, then the worst-performing among this year 's USA TODAY All-Stars -- 25 funds chosen for consistent long-term performance -- might be the ones that look the best next year. <p> The All-Stars are diversified domestic stock funds that have had the same manager for at least five years and have beaten their peers over the long term. <p> They 're not designed to beat all other funds in the short term. But they 're the tops in their categories, and they cover a range of investment philosophies, from conservative to aggressive, so an investor using the All-Stars can tailor a portfolio to fit personal needs. <p> The investment world is divided into two broad camps : value and growth. Value managers, such as Rogers, look for undervalued, unloved stocks and wait for Wall Street to discover them. Growth managers try to find stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them. Growth funds, the darlings of the 1990s, have plunged 42% the past five years. Value funds are up 18%. <p> Rogers, who gained 16% in the past 12 months alone, marvels at how the world has changed. He recalls visiting his health club in Chicago five years ago, when investors did n't want to hear about no stinkin ' insurance company stock. " There was a professional basketball player talking about Yahoo stock, " he says. " Later on, I went to a city council meeting and an alderwoman was talking about the same thing. " <p> In that atmosphere, Rogers and other value managers were n't getting much respect. Investors were yanking money from funds such as Clipper and Ariel in favor of boiling-hot growth funds like those offered by Janus and PBHG. Janus Olympus, for example, soared 100% in 1999 ; Clipper fell 2% that year. <p> " We had redemptions day after day, " says James Gipson, co-manager of Clipper, another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossils for not buying Yahoo. " Respected value managers like Robert Sanborn of Oakmark left the business. <p> Now growth managers are getting the ax, and growth funds are starting to disappear. ING, for example, replaced the management of ING Global Growth this month and renamed the fund ING Global Value Choice. ING International SmallCap Growth is now just ING International SmallCap.( Cap refers to capitalization, the price of a company 's stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.) Janus, PBHG and Putnam have all made major management shifts among their growth funds. <p> Tom Marsico, manager of Marsico Growth, an All-Star, ticks off reasons growth stocks have remained in the doldrums for so long : <p> * Rising interest rates. Growth stocks thrive on lower interest rates, which make their earnings look even more attractive when compared with safe investments such as Treasury bills or money-market funds. " That 's the big tail wind that stopped driving growth stocks, " Marsico says. <p> * Scandal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mutual fund trading scandal. Companies such as Putnam, PBHG, Strong and Janus were caught letting privileged clients trade in and out of their funds rapidly at the expense of long-term shareholders. Gary Pilgrim, former star manager of PBHG, and Richard Strong, CEO of the Strong funds, both lost their jobs because of the scandal, as did Lawrence Lasser, head of the Putnam funds. <p> The scandal broke long after the bear market was over but may have driven even more investors from growth funds. <p> In the meantime, stocks of commodity producers, such as U.S. Steel and Phelps Dodge, have soared the past 12 months. Those stocks, which inevitably get smacked when the economy slows and soar when it recovers, are traditional favorites of value managers. " The stars and moon aligned for them, " says John C. Thompson, co-manager of Thompson Plumb Growth, an All-Star. <p> Thompson suspects that foreign selling may be one reason classic large-company growth stocks, such as Coca-Cola, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you were a foreign investor in U.S. stocks, chances are you invested in big-cap companies, " he says. Those stocks have performed poorly the last five years : The Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index, which measures the price of large-cap companies, has fallen 12% since March 2000. An investor who bought the S &P; 500 with euros, however, has lost 36% because of the dollar 's fall on world currency markets. <p> Value vanishing <p> After their five-year run, however, value managers are having a tough time finding bargains. Clipper 's Gipson uses a geography metaphor : Normally, he says, the stock market is like western Colorado. " Now it 's like eastern Colorado, " he says. Flat. <p> And expensive. In fact, he says, almost all investments look pricey to him : real estate, stocks, bonds. " You 're not being paid well to take significant risks, " Gipson says. Clipper now has 25% of its assets in money-market securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weitz Partners Value, an All-Star, is up to 30% in cash. Ariel has 18% in cash. " In my 22 years in the investment business, this is one of the toughest times to find small-cap value ideas, " Ariel 's Rogers says. <p> And even though value funds have fared well the past five years, value stocks can carry a great deal of risk. Many beaten-up stocks earn their beatings and take a long time to recover. <p> Clipper 's Gipson, for example, loaded up on Tyco stock after the company announced its accounting woes. <p> " My 10-year-old son said he 'd heard that Tyco would be the next Enron, " Gipson says. " For a while I was known as the second-best investor in the household. " <p> Because growth has performed poorly and value funds are loaded with cash, the USA TODAY All-Stars had a tough year. They gained an average 6.2% vs. 7.2% for the average stock fund and a gain of 7% for the S &P; 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We moved to long-term, consistent growers, such as Coca-Cola, Fannie Mae and Microsoft, " says Thompson, whose fund was at the bottom of the All-Star list. " Earnings have gone up, but by and large, the stocks have n't. " <p> In fact, Marsico argues, growth stocks are the screaming value of the day. " Growth is at a value we have n't seen since the early 1980s, " he says. <p> Case in point : Lowe 's, the home-improvement store. The company will see 12% to 14% growth in square footage at its stores, he says, and earnings should grow 20%. But the stock sells at about 15 times its estimated earnings. " That 's a cheap stock, " he says.( Marsico Growth owns the stock.) <p> Rogers is a true value believer. You wo n't find him chasing high-priced stocks any time soon. But he 's got one cheap stock he 's buying now : Its price is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular on Wall Street, and it 's becoming popular with other value managers. It 's Janus Capital, parent company of the once-hot Janus funds. <p> " It 's the poster child of large-cap growth companies, " he says. <p> -- <p> How we selected the All-Star team <p> We choose the All-Stars for consistent, long-term performance. One good year is n't enough to make the team, and one bad year is n't usually enough to get benched. The basic criteria to make -- and stay -- on the All-Stars team : <p> * Diversified U.S. stock funds only. No international or specialty funds. That narrows the field to about 3,700 funds. <p> * Above-average performance within their fund category for the past five years. That brings the list down to about 1,300. <p> * The same manager for the past five years. A record does n't mean much if another manager achieved it. About 760 funds made this cut. <p> * Three-year performance ca n't be within the bottom 20%. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management. That chops 40 funds off the candidates. <p> * The fund must be open to new investors, with no limits on who can invest. Now the list is down to about 520. Funds that do n't meet these basic criteria get tossed. This year, we sent Harbor Capital Appreciation and Northern Select Equity packing because of their five-year records. Longleaf Partners, alas, is no longer taking new investments. <p> We try to choose new funds within the same broad categories as the old ones. Criteria for making the new team is stricter : <p> * Above-average returns for three and five years. <p> * Positive alpha and, for conservative and moderate funds, beta below 1. Beta shows how much a fund rises or falls in relation to the Standard &; Poor 's 500 stock index. Alpha is a measure of how much value the manager adds to the portfolio. We also look for a positive Sharpe ratio, another measure of risk-adjusted performance. <p> * Above-average success ratio. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund 's monthly return beat a benchmark index. A low success ratio suggests the fund 's return was due to a few big periods of outperformance, rather than consistent, long-term gains.
