3068741 <p> In a Boulder courtroom, Sharon Abuso sits calm and composed, at ease except for the weighty distraction of carrying twins beneath her maternity clothes. <p> It 's mid-November, and the babies are n't due until January. But today, she will surrender any legal claim to them. <p> It 's part of the plan : Sharon, 42, volunteered to bear embryos produced by Ralph and Lorraine Drewes - her brother- and sister-in-law - when the couple 's unproductive, decade-long quest for genetic offspring left them with this lone option. <p> Sharon already has given birth to two sons ; this pregnancy is about nephews. <p> Judge Carol Glowinsky, presiding over juvenile court, probes to make sure that Sharon understands this unusual prebirth determination of parentage. Perhaps, Glowinsky offers, she would like to " wait and see " how she feels after the twins have been born. <p> " No, " Sharon replies firmly. <p> Her husband Louie, 43, nods his agreement. <p> " We know exactly what we 're doing, " Sharon continues. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon 's obvious conviction, the judge grants an order sealing the deal and offers her congratulations to both couples. Although Sharon will carry the twins, their birth certificates ultimately will reflect genetic parents Ralph and Lorraine as legal parents, too. <p> Sharon waddles outside the courtroom and eases herself onto a bench to rest. It has not been an easy pregnancy. Reckoning by sheer size, she would already be well into her ninth month if she were carrying a single fetus. <p> The nausea of the first several weeks has been replaced by the heartburn of recent months, which has dulled her appetite altogether. One of the twins has demonstrated a particular fondness for kicking her in the ribs. She ca n't sleep comfortably in her own bed, so she often moves to the couch. <p> And it 's still two months until her Jan. 15 due date. <p> But Sharon harbors no regrets about carrying her in-laws ' babies. It was n't even a difficult decision, despite her basic aversion to pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to an end. " <p> Expectant aunt <p> With a heart toughened by 20 years of police work and tempered by deep religious belief, Sharon does not fluster easily, and her attitude about her role approaches nonchalance. Nevertheless, her pregnancy has put a new spin on the Abuso household dynamics, particularly with two young sons waiting for their mother to give birth to their cousins. <p> Sharon and Louie love that they 're doing this for Ralph and Lorraine - in fact, they practically insisted on it - but gently joke about looking forward to the postpartum denouement of sending the twins home with their genetic parents. <p> No infants crying in stereo, no midnight feedings to disrupt sleep, no college funds to fatten for the next 18 years. Sharon knows she 'll always feel an extra bond with the babies who have been growing inside her, but she speaks like the doting aunt, not the expectant mother. <p> She and Louie exchange tired smiles - a look that reminds them how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated house. The Dreweses ' lawyer returns with the court order that will reflect Ralph and Lorraine as the twins ' parents at birth - mission accomplished. <p> " Do you agree with this, dear? " Sharon asks her husband playfully, already knowing the answer. <p> " Do I ever, " Louie replies. <p> Louie Abuso, the oldest boy in a family of five kids, always looked after little sister Lorraine as they grew up in the rough-and-tumble New York borough of Queens. <p> They both wound up in Colorado - he working as a cop in Greeley and she offering child care in Longmont, just a few miles on the other side of Interstate 25. Their bond remained rock-solid, and the strong family ties came to include their spouses as well. <p> So when Lorraine and Ralph Drewes suffered setback after setback in their desire to have a child, the aftershocks also rattled the Abuso home. <p> " I always knew there 'd be a two-week period when she was so depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the same person. She 'd be totally withdrawn. " <p> The Dreweses ' frustration touched Louie and Sharon on two levels. As relatives, they hated to see loved ones so distressed. As police officers, they held up Ralph and Lorraine 's futility in contrast to child-abuse horror stories they encountered on the job. <p> " All around us people who did n't want kids were having them, " says Sharon, who traded her job as a detective for a small day-care operation in her home so she could be closer to her own children. <p> By the time Lorraine 's doctor advised her that further artificial insemination would probably prove fruitless, Louie and Sharon already had discussed the idea of gestational surrogacy. If Lorraine needed to borrow a uterus, Sharon was a willing donor. <p> Still, Lorraine was slow to accept the offer. <p> " She wanted so hard to do this herself, " says Louie, a no-nonsense guy who did n't think his sister should quibble about details like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' That 's just a chick thing. Let 's get this done. ' I think, as well as I know her, that she saw this as her last option. She was thinking she was putting the family out. That was the thing holding her back. " <p> But even accepting Sharon 's offer did n't guarantee success. The first implantation of four embryos did n't take. Left with six healthy embryos, the two couples weighed the options : Implant one, two, maybe three, and save the rest in case they needed to try again? Or implant all six and increase the odds of success - but run a greater risk of multiple births? <p> Reacting on faith and instinct, Sharon and Lorraine looked at each other and decided to go for broke. <p> " We put it in God 's hands, " says Sharon, " and he took care of us. " <p> Though blessed with a manageable pregnancy with twins, the Abusos were left the task of explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-year-old Adam. Lisa, Louie 's 15-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, was already on board. <p> To their parents ' relief, the boys grasped the situation remarkably well. Adam simply accepted that Mommy was carrying babies for " Aunt Rainy and Uncle Bah, " as the boys know Lorraine and Ralph. <p> There were only two issues with Scott. When he found out his mother was carrying twins, he assumed his family would get to keep the extra baby. Advised that was n't going to happen, he expressed concern that he would n't get to see the twins at the hospital. <p> His parents guaranteed he could see the boys before they went home. <p> Now, both Scott and Adam curl up with their mother before bedtime while she reads a story to their cousins. <p> Afterward, they kiss her belly and say good-night. <p> " How 's Momma doing? " ask friends and acquaintances. <p> " I 'm not Momma. I 'm Aunt, " comes the reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been clouded by her biological attachment to the twins. In fact, she speaks to Lorraine almost daily, describing her pregnancy in vivid detail so that her sister-in-law might vicariously live it - nausea and discomfort included - through Sharon 's words. <p> " Hey, " quips Louie to his wife, " if Lorraine really wants to experience it, then call her in the middle of the night every time you have to pee. " <p> Lorraine playfully rides her brother to make Sharon 's life as stress-free as possible. In return, Sharon offers her sister-in-law an experienced mother 's perspective on what lies ahead. <p> " She 's so sweet that way, " says Lorraine, who also accompanies Sharon on prenatal visits to her doctor. " There 's nothing we have n't discussed. We did circumcision the other day. Sometimes I do n't sleep at night thinking about how wonderful she is. " <p> Wonderfulness aside, there does exist a contract, drawn up on the advice of an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples speak of it as an unnecessary exercise among family so close, so entirely in agreement about every aspect of the pregnancy. But they went along with it anyway, just so everything was covered. <p> Sharon is n't being paid to carry the twins and her insurance covers all her pregnancy-related care. But there 's a $ 15 co-payment for each office visit, and the Dreweses pick that up. <p> There 's a no-drinking, no-drugs clause and language defining legal rights to the babies. And there 's even an inside joke. <p> " We put in the contract that Louie ca n't name the kids, " says Sharon. <p> That has n't stopped him from lobbying hard for " Scott, " an Abuso family favorite, in the event a boy is born. Although both couples agreed that they 'd wait until birth to learn the twins ' gender, shadowy but unmistakable protrusions on a subsequent ultrasound ended any mystery. <p> In the end, Lorraine 's affinity for cowboy romance novels won out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Those who celebrate the circumstances of their creation might also call them miracle babies, or modern medical marvels. Those who do not will contend the technology that made them possible has stepped beyond acceptable ethical or moral bounds. <p> The Abusos absolutely expected to encounter critics. So they 've been shocked that so far, Sharon 's gestational surrogacy has n't met with a discouraging word - although they 're certain opposition to the procedure is out there. <p> " Some people in the religious world might say this is taking things too far, " says Sharon. " Personally, I think having someone carry a dead person 's baby is going too far. Everyone draws a line somewhere. But I 'd take the baby into consideration first, and I know Ralph and Lorraine will be great parents. " <p> Her own religious faith does not preclude the intervention of medical science to create and nurture this pregnancy. She believes God has guided a process that produced results even the doctors and embryologists ca n't explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Sharon says. " Why did n't this work the first time? Why only two this time? They ca n't answer that - and they did everything the same both times. " <p> The practicalities of her pregnancy have been simple enough to deal with. When Louie had to leave town for a few weeks over the summer for police training, he made sure to arrange for someone to take care of the lawn. <p> Sharon, who regularly watches after four children in her home day-care operation, cuts back on the long walks to the park. Friends fill in when it 's her turn to drive in the school car pool. <p> The family Thanksgiving feast the Abusos usually host takes place this year at Ralph and Lorraine 's house, where even the barely mobile Sharon ignores her heartburn long enough to stuff herself. Much of the conversation revolves around the twins ' impending arrival, and what would be the most appropriate date. <p> Everyone offers a wishful guess. Lorraine 's mom roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer Dec. 19 - her birthday. Lorraine had a vivid dream that the twins would be born on Dec. 28. <p> Nobody believes Sharon will carry Jake and Jesse until the middle of January. The multiple pregnancy, coupled with her history of delivering her own babies early, has spurred talk of a particularly festive holiday season. <p> Sharon would prefer to spend Christmas at home, not at the hospital. The significant date on her calendar is Dec. 16, when the fraternal twins ' gestation will reach 36 weeks. That magic number usually means fewer complications with premature birth. <p> Now, she 's trying to coax Jesse into the ready position for a head-first exit. Jake, the rib-kicker, already is poised for a headlong plunge down the birth canal, which would eliminate the need for a Caesarean section. Sharon tells herself the discomfort, the heartburn - the endless admonitions to eat when she 's not hungry - wo n't last forever. <p> " I 'm not crazy about pregnancy, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore. " <p> All along, she has referred to herself simply as " the oven, " playfully putting an emotional distance between herself and the buns rising inside her. <p> " If they used my egg, it might be a different thing. But these - " and here Sharon embraces the sons who have climbed on the couch next to her - " these are mine. I 've been there, done that. Twice. " <p> There is an air of anticipation around the Abuso house, but it 's different from the expectant joy in Longmont, where the Dreweses have prepared the boys ' room in Winnie-the-Pooh motif, packed the diaper bag and mapped out the quickest route to the hospital in Greeley. <p> Lorraine and Ralph await the arrival of twins. Sharon and Louie await the return to normalcy. <p> " We get to visit, " Sharon says, already savoring the role of extra-special aunt. <p> " And when they cry, " beams Louie, " we get to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SimpsonKS@aol.com.
