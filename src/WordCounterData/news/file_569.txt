4130841 Ryan Lochte looks at the steering wheel of his 2014 Range Rover, furrows his brow and pauses. He pulls out his cellphone and plugs the sandwich shop 's address into an app that tracks GPS. He has given up. " When I first moved here, I tried not to use the GPS for anything so I could learn how to get around, " Lochte says. " But then I realized I just kept getting lost everywhere. I 'd be late for practice, get a call, and I 'd be like, ' I think I 'm in Georgia. ' " He laughs. The swimmer still thinks of himself as the new guy in town, but he has been a Charlotte resident for nine months. In many ways, it has been one of the most challenging stretches of his life. He moved away from home and family, leaving the college-town lifestyle and its temptations. He changed coaches and, with that, his training regimen. He has suffered multiple injury setbacks, including a significant one to his knee that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplating quitting the sport. But he 's still here. He 's still swimming. He has his eye on the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where he 's hoping to add to his 11 medals. But the immediate future is more pressing : U.S. national championships this week in Irvine, Calif., and the Pan Pacific Championships in Australia this month. Those meets will determine the U.S. team for next year 's world championships. They 'll also be proving ground for Lochte, coming off a year full of challenges and change. Over the course of an all-access week with USA TODAY Sports this summer, he reflected on a time that has forced him to grow up, as a swimmer and as a man. LIVING LIFE OF a CELEBRITY After winning five medals, including two gold, and being declared one of the nation 's newest heartthrobs in London, Lochte transitioned from world-class swimmer to celebrity -- and the E! reality series, What Would Ryan Lochte Do? was a big reason. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Lochte 's popularity soared. So did the amount of extracurricular activities. " I 'm not going to lie, it was amazing, " Lochte says. " If you 're a swimmer, you do n't go to a red carpet event for a movie premiere. You 're not hanging out with Sylvester Stallone.... I never thought swimming would take me that far. But at the same time, I almost quit swimming that year, especially when my show happened. I never swam during my show. I tried to. We tried to play it off during the show, but I could n't.... " It was hard doing all these celebrity things, because you get sucked into that lifestyle, the idea of being that celebrity. You can get sucked in so easily. I was like, ' Nah, I do n't want to do it, I do n't want to swim anymore. ' " Lochte says he regrets he did n't emphasize swimming or training during the show. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an overgrown frat boy -- was n't ideal. " I did it because I wanted to do it ; I had a blast doing it, " Lochte says. " It was probably not a good decision to do it while I was swimming. But the best thing about that was it made me and my family closer. You can say I 'm a party boy, but I do n't care, because when it comes down to it, family is the only thing that matters in my life. They 're the ones that help me through everything. " coaching change Last summer was when Lochte began mulling the idea of moving. He had been training with Gregg Troy in Gainesville, Fla., for 12 years -- and won 11 Olympic medals under Troy 's tutelage -- but had decided he was ready to make a change. One of his best friends, Cullen Jones, had been training with David Marsh and SwimMAC in Charlotte since 2008. Lochte was drawn to the program for multiple reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training together for national/international competition instead of college swimmers ; and he could focus on technique work and improve shorter events under Marsh 's watchful eye. Marsh has tried to encourage the emotional growth that comes with it. He connects Lochte with local pro athletes, those who understand the fame, money and athletic success, and also with Jeremy Boone, a Charlotte-based sports performance consultant. Lochte and Boone meet regularly for lunch or kayaking to discuss anything from swimming to relationships( Lochte is single) to outside interests. "( David) does n't want me just to be a more mature swimmer in the water. He wants me to be a more mature swimmer out of the water, too, taking things into my own hands, " Lochte says. "( David) wants me to do so well in swimming, but he also wants me to do so well outside of the sport. " Jones sees it, too. He sees it in the way Lochte allocates his time, the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he handles all of the fan attention. " He 's maturing, for sure, " Jones says. " He had to. " INJURIES TAKE TOLL Lochte began training with Marsh in the fall, but he was n't always in Charlotte. He traveled back and forth to Florida and to and from other commitments. But when he started to settle into the training, he suffered a major setback in the form of a freak injury. He tore his left medial collateral ligament and sprained his anterior cruciate ligament Nov. 1 during a fan encounter in Florida. He decided against surgery, which might have meant the end of his breaststroke career. Lochte had injured his left knee before, while break dancing in 2009. That kept him out of the pool for six months. This time he was out of the water completely for about two months -- and it was excruciating. He started to think, again, about calling it quits. " I was getting pissed off because I wanted to swim, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't be in the water. Your main focus is doing physical therapy, getting your knee healthy. Going from there. That was my main focus. At points during that time, I wanted to quit swimming. It was really hard for me. It got to the point where I felt like I was wasting my life, my swimming career away, because I could n't do anything. " I was just like, maybe it 's a sign that my career is over. " Marsh saw this and asked his pupil these questions -- What are your goals? What do you want to do in life? -- and promptly snapped him out of his funk. Lochte told him he wanted to change the sport of swimming, be one of the best swimmers ever. Was he there yet? No. So Lochte plodded through physical therapy. He made it through days and weeks. He eventually returned to the pool in late December and spent the next few months trying to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Michael Phelps in the Arena Mesa Grand Prix in April and beat the 22-time Olympic medalist in his signature event, the 100 butterfly. Weeks later, he retore his MCL, and that kept him out of competition until mid-July. The silver lining with the second injury, though, was that it did n't keep him out of the water. He kept a strap around his ankles, preventing him from kicking and forcing him to work on pulling. Isolating his pull was helpful, especially for his backstroke, Marsh says, likening the injury to making lemonade out of lemons. " It helped because some of the stuff that 's the weakest in my swimming was what I had to work on, " Lochte says. " I think my legs are faster underwater than they 've ever been, just because I was doing things right.... I 'm still supposed to be recovering right now. I 'm doing breaststroke, I 'm doing everything. I 'm kicking underwater. I 'm doing starts, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I can. " It 's something he always has done, and it 's always worrisome when dealing with a serious injury. " Gregg Troy had warned me that Ryan has a phenomenal pain tolerance, " Marsh says. " It 's part of what makes him able to go, in races, places that other swimmers wo n't go. He 'll dig into deep, deep pain to get where he 's trying to accomplish. That 's not a good thing with injuries. He wants to tell you everything is OK. As Gregg warned me, he often says things are OK when they 're not OK. He 's just being that Superman he 's used to being. " This is a process that ends in the Olympic Games, not necessarily this summer. I think a lot of it, not only dealing with injuries but the growth and development, is about him moving forward as a person. "
