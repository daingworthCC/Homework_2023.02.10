5019841 <p> State legislators are debating proposals to change how members of the University of Minnesota 's governing body are picked, a system critics say has sometimes favored the politically connected over the most qualified. <p> The process has drawn fresh attention after the surprise resignation of Regent Patricia Simmons on Wednesday. The Republican-controlled Legislature or DFL Gov. Mark Dayton must now appoint a replacement. <p> " There 's always things we think we can improve, " said Sen. Michelle Fischbach, R-Paynesville, chairwoman of the Senate Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee. <p> The U 's 12 regents approve major policies, educational programs and annual budgets. The unpaid board comprises one member from each of the state 's eight congressional districts. Four are selected at-large. <p> Board hopefuls typically apply through the Regent Candidate Advisory Council, a 24-member body appointed by the Legislature. The panel sends its suggestions to a legislative commission, which makes recommendations to the full Legislature. <p> The new proposals would give the Legislature more authority over the selections. <p> A Fischbach plan would limit the panel 's influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates from their congressional districts. <p> Rep. Gene Pelowski, DFL-Winona, is sponsoring a measure to repeal the advisory council, saying lawmakers often ignore the panel 's recommendation. <p> " The council is not really selecting regent candidates that are in the best public interest of the University of Minnesota, " Pelowski said. " It 's a hybrid type of politics to get a particular political animal appointed regent. " <p> Regent Darrin Rosha has been through the vetting process three times -- he was elected to the board in 1989, 2015 and 2017, but the advisory panel chose not to interview him in 2015. He was elected later by the Legislature. <p> " Obviously, you 're not talking about qualification at that point, you 're actually talking about preference, which is not RCAC 's role, " he said. <p> Regent Steve Sviggum, a former GOP speaker of the House, said the process should be tweaked. The advisory council vetted Sviggum when he was elected in 2011, but he bypassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the board. <p> " There 's some reasonable rationale behind that concept of congressional districts doing the vetting for the eight persons and the RCAC doing it for the four at-large, " Sviggum said. <p> Ryan Faircloth is a University of Minnesota student on assignment for the Star Tribune.
