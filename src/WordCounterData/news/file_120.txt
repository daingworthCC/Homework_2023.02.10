3025841 <p> Cargo ships carrying several months ' worth of supplies are en route to U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. And soldiers ' families are starting to wonder if their loved ones will be home for Christmas. <p> Everywhere, it 's sinking in : The U.S.-Iraq showdown may be a long, frustrating ordeal. <p> In a speech Monday to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore, President Bush warned that the Persian Gulf crisis " will require American planning, patience and yes, personal sacrifice. " <p> The longer the standoff lasts, experts say, the harder it will be for the United States to extricate itself from the Middle East. The likely result : an erosion of public and political support for Bush and his policies. <p> Already, ghosts of the lingering Vietnam War are creeping into the national psyche : " I feel like Alice staring into the looking glass, " says Ron Kovic, the Vietnam veteran portrayed in the film Born on the Fourth of July, " seeing that same horror and nightmare about to repeat itself. " <p> Unlike swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. force rushed into Saudi Arabia spells a long-term commitment, military experts say. <p> " There is no quick victory in this situation, " says retired rear admiral Eugene Carroll of the Center for Defense Information. " We 'll either be hunkered down in the sand waiting for something to occur or maybe provoking some military involvement that 's totally open-ended. " <p> Experts wonder whether the United States has the willpower to stay in the Middle East for years : <p> - If Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is ousted, Iran is poised to move in and the United States would have to fend it off, Carroll says. If political and economic sanctions work and Saddam withdraws from Kuwait, he 'd be lurking just across the border waiting to cause more trouble. " It 's going to be a terrible problem to find the excuse and justification for saying that the mission is accomplished and we can go home, " he says. <p> - The contention that Iraq is a threat to U.S. oil supplies may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years when we could have been developing an effective energy policy, " says Noel Koch, a Georgetown University military expert. Bush 's message will sour if U.S. troops die in combat and the public concludes " oil is more important to us than American blood. " <p> - David Rohde, a Michigan State University political science professor, says he 's " puzzled " the administration did n't stress to the public that it would take up to six months for the economic embargo against Iraq to work. " At the very least, the American government has undermined chances of acceptance of its policy by not being candid and forthright about what to expect. " <p> - Support from the United Nations and other Arab countries is critical, says Michael Marsden, professor of popular culture at Ohio 's Bowling Green State University. " It 's important for America to be perceived as in the moral right, " he says. <p> - Even if U.S. forces strike - grabbing the hostages and ejecting Saddam - troops would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government. <p> But naval expert Norman Friedman says there 's a way to sell a long stay in Saudi Arabia - as a peacekeeping force : " We 're in Europe forever, and that works, " he says. " This could be a replacement for our NATO commitment. As long as people have a sense that this is a finite thing - not in the sense of short - but in the sense you can imagine how this war ends, it could work. " <p> So far, Congress - across the USA on summer recess - has lined up firmly behind Bush. Second-guessing has n't erupted on the campaign trail, and it may not be an issue until 1992 elections. <p> " The key point, it seems to me, is not to get too far out in front of the international consensus, " says Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Middle East Subcommittee. " The United States must not go it alone. We must frame this confrontation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand, and Iraq, on the other. " <p> The politicians ' rule : " The longer these crises go on, the worse it becomes for the president, " says Democratic campaign consultant Brian Lunde. " It will take an event to crystallize public opinion, or it will drift and there will be a slow erosion in the president 's support. <p> Lunde says politicians are unwilling to blast Bush until he makes a mistake : " The political course of action is stay in the bunker, until you hear some shots, either rhetorically or real. " <p> Jody Powell, former press secretary to President Jimmy Carter, recalls support for efforts to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran faltered in 1979 when people sensed " futility and frustration. " <p> " I think the American public is, frankly, prepared to stick with the president for a reasonable period of time, so long as the policy seems to have a real chance of producing a favorable outcome within foreseeable future. " <p> Bush 's advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can act without worrying about Soviet involvement ; " for the average citizen, there is no apparent cost. " <p> The gulf crisis is nothing like the Vietnam quagmire - where U.S. forces could n't win and could n't get out - experts say. Intervention in the gulf came only after Saddam 's provocative invasion of Kuwait. U.S. forces have gone in swiftly, instead of incrementally, and with almost universal international support. <p> President Bush compares the Iraqi dictator 's attack on Kuwait to Adolf Hitler 's aggression before World War II. But if footage of U.S. soldiers coming home in body bags starts showing up on the nightly news, Vietnam memories may get stronger. <p> And Saddam, experts say, is counting on the U.S. public 's short attention span to pressure Bush into bring the troops home - just as public sentiment prompted the USA 's departure from Vietnam without winning. <p> Most U.S. residents, bristling with patriotic fervor, have rallied around Bush 's decisions. But there are signs of skepticism : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday on the steps of Omaha 's federal courthouse. <p> " Instead of gung ho, we 're starting to hear that we 're just over there for the oil interests, " says the group 's Robin Carter. " Is this to get support for not cutting the military budget? Are we looking for some high- visibility issue to take the heat off the savings and loan scandal? " <p> - In Fresno, Calif., high school civics teacher Vincent Lavery organized a protest march last weekend. " The American people have got to get out there on the streets, " he says. " This has the ingredients of all-out war, and it is not worth dying for oil. " <p> Meanwhile, in Topeka, families of the Kansas National Guard are bracing for a long haul, organizing support groups, pleading for the public to donate stamps, planning for " family disasters. " <p> " People are gearing up for the worst, " says Capt. John Andrews, family support coordinator. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but people are starting to realize it 's for real. " CUTLINE : Stealth 's Mideast mission ; DESERT-BOUND : Radar-evading F-117A stealth fighters prepare to take off Monday from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to fly to an undisclosed site in Saudi Arabia. The 19 planes were sent to deter Iraqi aggression. It 's only the second time the bat-winged fighters have been sent into a combat zone - two were used during the Panama invasion.
