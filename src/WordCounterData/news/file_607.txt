4134641 Bradley Cooper stars in his best pals ' small film, ' The Words. ' How good a friend are you? Would you pick up your friend at the airport during rush hour? Would you help your friend move out of his apartment by loading a truck in 100-degree weather? Would you agree to take care of your friend 's three pit bulls while he is on vacation? Here 's how Bradley Cooper defines friendship. A few weeks ago, the 37-year-old actor appeared in a supporting role as a bad guy in buddy Dax Shepherd 's low-budget movie " Hit and Run. " The big deal is that Cooper does n't do supporting roles in low-budget movies anymore - not with the success of the two " Hangover " movies, the " A-Team " and " Limitless. " And need we mention his elevation to leading-man status after People magazine named him the " Sexiest Man Alive " in 2011? If that was n't an impressive enough display of friendship, Cooper stars this week in his best friend 's first movie - " The Words. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of Cooper 's closest friends - Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal. The three men have been close since growing up together in Philadelphia. We thought it might be fun to sit down with the trio in a Los Angeles hotel suite to chat about their friendship, how Cooper 's clout helped get the movie made and what the men thought of Cooper 's designation as the " Sexiest Man Alive. " Hint : One man thought it was a gag. In " The Words, " which opens today, Cooper( who also serves as one of the film 's executive producers) plays a struggling young writer who ca n't get his work published. During his honeymoon in Paris, he stumbles upon an old manuscript that he later passes off as his own. As his star ascends, he meets an old man( Jeremy Irons) with a secret that could throttle the young man 's ascension. ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER : Q.Exactly how far back do the three of you go? BRADLEY COOPER : Brian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee go back to 10 years old. It was n't until I moved out here that Lee and I became friends through Brian. BRIAN KLUGMAN : I went to summer camp with Lee. LEE STERNTHAL : I think Bradley and I met at Brian 's bar mitzvah. OCR : Q.Having established this long friendship, I was wondering how long it took you two( Brian and Lee) to stop laughing after he was named the " Sexiest Man Alive. " BC : They 're still laughing at me. BK : I called him up when it happened. I was really happy for him. I thought it was really, really cool. BC : I think I called Brian right away and told him that I thought I was being " P'unked. " Dax Shepherd is my buddy, and he used to be on that show. I thought it was some great big joke that someone had played on me. BK : I never laughed ; I swear. OCR : Q.I ca n't believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt. OCR : Q.Did the magazine naming him the " Sexiest Man Alive " help you get your movie made? BK : I do n't think so ; I think the movie was already made. OCR : Q.But did n't his continuing success help get this movie made? BK : His career and continuing success was very good for the movie and for him. His success was the reason we were able to get the movie financed, and the reason we were able to get the movie distributed. OCR : Q.I understand there is a traffic jam involved in the making of this movie. BK : That 's true. Lee and I were stuck in a traffic jam on the 10 freeway about 10 years ago. LS : We were having a discussion about the lost works of writers, and specifically about Hemingway, because that book had just come out about Hemingway 's wife losing his manuscript. We started to have a " What if? " conversation, like what if you found a manuscript like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story kind of spun out from that conversation. OCR : Q.What took so long to finish it? BK : We wrote the first 30 or 40 pages the first night, and then it took awhile to fill out the rest. Through the years, we always went back to it and worked on it. OCR : Q.How did it change over the years? LS : We wrote it when we were 25 years old. We essentially were babies when we started it. As we 've grown over the years, we 've brought some experience and deeper understanding of life to the writing. We kept rewriting, but the structure of the story stayed the same. OCR : Q.What should a nonwriter get from this film? LS : I do n't think Brian or I want to tell people what to get from the movie. I hope there 's empathy. Put yourself in someone else 's shoes. BC : It 's about choices, and the consequences of those choices. It fields questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live our lives. OCR : Q.I saw this movie without knowing anything about it, but I will have to reveal some of the plot in the introduction of this article, and you and the studio will have to reveal plot points in the trailers to get people into theaters. Does that bother you? BK : Look, we made this movie in 25 days for $6 million. We 're just happy to get it into the theaters. LS : I know what you 're saying. It 's hard to reveal certain aspects of the story. I read an interview with David Fincher, who said he would like no details to be revealed until the movie comes out. That is the ideal. You want people to discover it on their own, but this is the nature of the business. OCR : Q.Bradley, where were you in your career when this movie was filming? BC : " The Hangover 2 " came out while we were filming. OCR : Q.Were you helping out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual merit in the script? BC : A little of both. I would do anything for him ; he 's been my best buddy since we were 10. I know how much this project means to him. I have been around this project since I got to L.A. I was at the first reading of it. I never thought I would get to play Rory, but I always thought he was an interesting character. The truth is that I wanted to help them out, but in the process, they helped me out. OCR : Q.In what way? BC : I grew in ways I never thought I would, and I got to work with unbelievable actors. It was a win-win for me. OCR Q. : Why did you think you would n't be able to play Rory? BC : It was such a deep personal thing for these guys, and I was afraid that I would fail them. They were putting a lot of confidence in me by giving me the job, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character. The idea of playing someone who is delusional and ambitious was hard for me, but that 's not really who he is. I realized that after I read the script again. It 's more interesting that he is a talented writer who is impatient. That 's a much more interesting concept to work with. OCR : Q.Did playing him give you any pause as to how you would handle his situation? BC : No. OCR : Q.The movie meant so much to you that you never gave it a thought? BC : I thought you meant would I plagiarize. I thought he robbed himself of the thrill of discovery, and that 's why I 'm an actor. I would n't want to rob myself of that thrill. You do n't have to do what your character does to have a profound experience playing him. OCR : Q.What about you writers? BK : Of course, we thought a lot about that because he robbed himself of the joy of doing something himself. LS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deadline. I ca n't imagine the pressure of having to write like that. I could never do what Rory did, but it did make me think about it. OCR : Q.How did you divide the directing duties? LS : Brian would go over and tell the actors one thing, and then I would go over and tell them the opposite( all three men laugh). BC : Brian would speak to the actors, and Lee would set up the shots. OCR : Q.I assume that you writers are just hoping that this film is well-received enough to lead to a second film, but what about you, Bradley? How does this small film fit into your big career? BC : Honestly, I never dreamed of something like this ; to work with my best friends on a project that means so much to them. It was n't in my mind-set, but I wound up benefiting from this tremendously. I may have helped them get it made, but they helped me by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1110, or bkoltnow@ocregister.com
