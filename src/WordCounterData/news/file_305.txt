3052141 <p> The four empty E &J; bottles were lined up side by side, like brandy soldiers, on the flower-filled median strip of Quesada Avenue in San Francisco 's Bayview district. Block resident Karl Paige, making his morning rounds plucking garbage from the community garden, had placed them there. It was a small take, nothing like the old days. <p> On one of the most transformed streets in town, this was another sign of progress. <p> " Five years ago, when I walked down the sidewalk, there was so much trash I 'd have to kick it aside, " Paige recalled. <p> Neighborhood merchant Edward Mazzei, whose family has owned a hardware store on Third Street since 1937, said, " It was a concrete jungle. " <p> The street 's metamorphosis began in 2002 when Paige and Annette Young Smith, who also lives on Quesada, started the garden on the median -- which had been a dumping ground for car parts, mattresses and other flotsam and jetsam. <p> A lot has happened since then. <p> Flowers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third Street to the east to Newhall Street to the west. When The Chronicle last wrote about the block in September 2004, Quesada residents had driven out most drug dealers, forced the sale of a dilapidated vacant house, gotten rid of vehicles camping on the strip and landed a water meter from the city. <p> Almost two years later, the garden is more lush than ever. Residents have formed the Quesada Gardens Initiative, a community-building project. To get grants, they secured fiscal sponsorship from Renaissance Parents of Success, a Bayview nonprofit. The Exploratorium featured Smith in a video about the garden, and the Clean and Green City Summit honored her and Paige five months ago. The two also received national Jefferson Awards for public service. <p> The city 's Community Challenge Grant Program has given the block $24,000 to paint a mural on an ugly concrete wall at the west end of the street, and San Francisco Beautiful has awarded $8,000 for a drip irrigation system. Schoolchildren take tours of the garden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canary Island date palms on the median are prospering -- they 've acquired landmark status. <p> Quesada residents have helped start another garden a block away, and Dr. Charles Drew Elementary School also has asked for their assistance. People elsewhere in the Bayview seek advice. Every time, the question is the same : How did you do it? <p> " They always say, ' I ca n't do it by myself, ' " said James Ross, who moved to Quesada in 1983. " That 's true, but somebody has to start. All it takes is two, three people who want to do it. If nobody gets started, wo n't nothing happen. " <p> It 's entirely possible that nothing would have transpired on Quesada if Smith 's brother, Woody Young, had n't begun gouging the dirt on the median to get worms for fishing bait. His sister stuck some plants in the ground to cover all the holes. <p> " I was surprised anything took root and grew in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " The dirt was so hard at that time that we had to take picks and dig. We 'd pour water, like you mix concrete, and put the plants in the mud. " <p> She and Paige cultivated the garden, using buckets of water the block 's residents would donate, and neighbors started gravitating to the median. <p> " When I came to Quesada, I knew two people on my block, " Ross recalled at a Clean and Green Summit workshop in February. " Now I know everyone on the block personally, and I have their home and cell phone numbers. " <p> He and Jeffrey Betcher, another Quesada resident, had been asked to give a presentation for the citywide summit. <p> " This is a beautiful example of literally a neighborhood transformation, " Liz Lerma, director of community programs at the Department of Public Works, told the crowd. <p> The 1700 block of Quesada is long, steep and wide. There is two-way traffic on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cul-de-sac. The Friends of the Urban Forest visited in December and planted trees a month later. <p> " This is one of the more beautiful blocks in the city, " said Karen Noll, the Friends ' community outreach manager. " Look at how much it has going on. It 's like a little ecosystem. " <p> In a more surprising alliance, the Kappa Sigma fraternity at Stanford University adopted Quesada as its community service project after reading about it in The Chronicle. <p> " I had no idea of the neighborhood or what it was like. I almost got shot the first time I came, " recalled Jacob Lemieux, who had wrangled with another motorist while driving through the Bayview. <p> One Saturday in mid-March, he and five fraternity brothers pulled weeds and painted a bench that residents had rebuilt after it was demolished by a stolen SUV. The vehicle had plunged into the garden and destroyed a cactus before being stopped by an aloe vera plant. After that, it flipped over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Lemieux 's idea. An idealistic product of Manhattan 's Upper East Side, he has worked at soup kitchens, in senior homes, with foster children and at a battered-women 's shelter in India. <p> " It 's rare to find something this functional, " a tired Lemieux said after yanking his final weed of the day. " There are not many service projects where you can see the change every time you come. " <p> In May, more than 50 Stanford students showed up. It 's never a hard sell. <p> " People love coming up here, " Lemieux said. " Everyone is so nice and accepting and welcoming. It 's really special what they have here. " <p> The work sessions always end with a potluck lunch provided by Quesada residents. <p> " They are the happiest weed-pulling kids I 've ever seen in my life, " Ross said weeks later. " They created a terrace. They cut it up and dug it out and put it in place. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billy goats, they just went right through it. " <p> In " San Francisco 's Bayview Hunters Point, " a 2005 book from Arcadia Publishing, author Tricia O'Brien included a photograph of the Quesada garden. <p> " It used to be a great place to live and neighbors helped each other, so this represented the neighbor concept coming full circle, " said O'Brien, who as a child often visited her grandparents in the Bayview. <p> She also stumbled upon a picture of the street from 1919, when it looked vastly different but had a diverse mix of people and lots of gardens -- much like today but minus the violence. <p> Quesada resident Shane King said a 13-year-old pulled a gun on his wife one morning and was hoping to rob her. Instead, she chased him down the block. <p> Despite incidents like this, Quesada has dramatically improved, said San Francisco police Officer Kevin McPherson, a beat cop on Third Street. <p> " It 's actually a pretty nice block, compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " All the progress on this block is real and it 's visible -- but it 's still rough around the edges. " <p> Those edges prompted Jeanette and Dennis Hill to rent out their Quesada house and move to the Ingleside for the sake of their young daughter and the baby boy that arrived three months after they left. <p> " I was fearful of the gunshots and sirens in the Bayview that I heard frequently, " Hill said. <p> She misses the " Quesadians, " though, and the positive energy of the garden. The Hills still plan to retire on the block. <p> In June, the passion that the street inspires was one of the reasons Betcher quit his job of 12 years as director of the Family Violence Prevention Fund. He wanted to devote more time to the Quesada Gardens Initiative. <p> " Every block of the Bayview deserves the level of community cohesiveness we now enjoy, " said Betcher, who painted his aged Victorian green and orange to match the palm trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " It 's just like a drug. You got people who start to drop by. ' What can I do for you? ' Just go out there and dig a hole. It 's guerrilla gardening. There are no rules.
