3045341 <p> You may think of it as a throbbing, god-awful toothache, but Dr. Peter Vanstrom sees a blank canvas. <p> Dentistry is a creative outlet for this California transplant. <p> " There 's an art to getting a root canal filled perfectly, just like there 's an art to doing a filling, " Vanstrom says. " Every tooth is a different color and different shape, so you really have to pay attention if you want to match everything just right. " <p> The masterpiece, of course, is a perfect smile, something Americans have been pursuing like mad in recent years. Blinding grins are everywhere, now that teeth whitening has become easy and affordable. <p> Vanstrom frequently appears on CNN as Atlanta 's expert on pearly whites. <p> In the camps that divide old-school dentists and cosmetic dentists, Vanstrom falls somewhere in between. <p> The Roswell resident says he gets just as excited over filling a cavity or doing a root canal as he does putting on a set of veneers. <p> " Some dentists are more analytic, but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " That 's where I derive the satisfaction from dentistry -- trying to make everything look as beautiful and as perfect as possible. " <p> Q : What led you to a career in dentistry? <p> A : I had a horrible bike accident when I was 13 years old, just when I was about to get my braces off. I knocked out some front teeth, so I had to go through a ton of dental work. I was spending quite a bit of time with the dentist and realized that I was really interested in the whole process. <p> Q : So, instead of getting scared off, you found a calling? <p> A : Yes, I thought it was neat. I was actually headed to medical school at first, but I quickly learned I did n't like the hospital very much. There 's a lot of psychology involved, and I could n't deal with getting close to people who were passing away. <p> Q : Speaking of psychology, most people dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to help people overcome their anxiety? <p> A : Well, I do n't think you can ever make them want to come. But when they schedule that appointment and they keep it, I guess that says we 're doing something right. My philosophy is to have as much technology as possible to make the visit as easy and as gentle as possible. But more than that, it starts with the first visit. We 'll spend an hour to an hour and a half just getting to know the patient -- not just talking about their dental needs but finding out about their other desires, their personality in general. It really helps us decide how we 're going to help this patient through the dental journey. <p> Q : Dental journey. That 's an interesting way of putting it. What do you mean by that? <p> A : We try to find out what the hot buttons are. Is the patient someone who 's concerned about how long their teeth are going to last? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentures, my father had dentures. I do n't want to have dentures. ' Other people just want a whiter, brighter smile. I say ' dental journey ' because our approach is, your teeth did n't get the way they are overnight, and it may take awhile to make them perfect. <p> Q : With the rise in cosmetic dentistry, do people expect perfect teeth these days? <p> A : Expectations have changed greatly in the past five to seven years. Patients used to be timid about improving their smiles, or even talking about whitening their teeth, especially the middle-aged patient. But now, it 's the first thing off their tongue. Even the geriatrics -- that 's an interesting age group because they never wanted to talk about how their teeth looked, it was just part of the aging process. Now I have 80-year-old ladies asking if I can make their teeth whiter. It 's just accepted -- and expected -- now. <p> Q : How are you using technology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a big breakthrough because it allows the patient to get involved in their care ; they can really see what 's going on. With a magnification of up to 40 times, the camera zooms in close on the teeth, then broadcasts the image on a large screen. When we were kids and went to the dentist, we just believed whatever he said. Now I can say, ' You have a problem, and here it is. ' A picture 's worth a thousand words, so I always take a before and after shot. It 's not the kind of thing you 'd show at a cocktail party, but I want people to really know what 's going on in the back of their mouths. That kind of ties into our philosophy on the first visit. We 're getting as much information about the patient as possible and giving them back as much info as we can, too. <p> Q : What are you doing to make the time in the dental chair less nerve-racking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out that does n't involve needles. We can use lasers to detect cavities earlier than ever before. Basically, the device emits a light that 's absorbed by the bacteria and reflected back in through the machine. It can detect cavities so early that you can do the filling without actually numbing the tooth with a shot. We 've also got a new product that numbs the gums without a shot -- it 's applied with a syringe, but there 's no needle. And there are also lasers and gases that will dissolve the decay without any numbing at all. <p> Q : What are the challenges in the business of dentistry? <p> A : The technology is obviously expensive. Debt is my friend -- that 's my chant every night. I 've learned to pick the toys that will bring the best payoff. For example, I 've got a digital X-ray machine because I perform root canals and do surgical implants. If something 's not quite right, I need to see the picture instantaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's teeth are generally healthier today than in the past. How does that impact your business? <p> A : Kids just do n't have as many cavities anymore, so the next 20 years will be fascinating because dentistry is going to be totally different. However, I 'm in an age group in which people still need the dentist. Even if they do n't have dental problems, people have the disposable income to concentrate on bright, straight smiles -- maybe that 's all there will be to do in 20 years, who knows? On the other hand, I 've seen research saying that roughly 50 percent of people do n't go to the dentist -- at least not regularly. That 's a huge untapped market. <p> OWNER, ARTISTIC DENTISTRY OF ATLANTA <p> Each week, an interview with one of metro Atlanta 's intriguing business personalities <p> * Age : 43 <p> * Personal : Married 21 years to high school sweetheart, Betty ; two daughters, Christine, 13, and Caroline, 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the University of California, Santa Barbara ; dentistry degree from Emory University. <p> * Hobbies : Scuba diving and sports <p> * Favorite recent book : " The Da Vinci Code " <p> * What he 'd be doing if not in his current profession : Landscape architect <p> * People would be surprised to know : His first home was a log cabin at the base of Glacier National Park in Montana.
