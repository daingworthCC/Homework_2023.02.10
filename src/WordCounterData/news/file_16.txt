3003041 <p> Following is the text of the final declaration issued by the NATO summit conference here today : <p> 1 Europe has entered a new, promising era. Central and Eastern Europe is liberating itself. The Soviet Union has embarked on the long journey toward a free society. The walls that once confined people and ideas are collapsing. Europeans are determining their own destiny. They are choosing freedom. They are choosing economic liberty. They are choosing peace. They are choosing a Europe whole and free. As a consequence, this Alliance must and will adapt. <p> 2 The North Atlantic Alliance has been the most successful defensive alliance in history. As our Alliance enters its fifth decade and looks ahead to a new century, it must continue to provide for the common defense. This Alliance has done much to bring about the new Europe. No one, however, can be certain of the future. We need to keep standing together, to extend the long peace we have enjoyed these past four decades. <p> Yet our Alliance must be even more an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a more united continent, supporting security and stability with the strength of our shared faith in democracy, the rights of the individual, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm that security and stability do not lie solely in the military dimension, and we intend to enhance the political component of our Alliance as provided for by Article 2 of our Treaty. <p> 3 The unification of Germany means that the division of Europe is also being overcome. A united Germany in the Atlantic Alliance of free democracies and part of the growing political and economic integration of the European Community will be an indispensable factor of stability, which is needed in the heart of Europe. The move within the European Community toward political union, including the development of a European identity in the domain of security, will also contribute to Atlantic solidarity and to the establishment of a just and lasting order of peace throughout the whole of Europe. <p> 4 We recognize that, in the new Europe, the security of every state is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must become an institution where Europeans, Canadians and Americans work together not only for the common defense, but to build new partnerships with all the nations of Europe. The Atlantic Community must reach out to the countries of the East which were our adversaries in the cold war, and extend to them the hand of friendship. <p> 5 We will remain a defensive alliance and will continue to defend all the territory of all of our members. We have no aggressive intentions and we commit ourselves to the peaceful resolution of all disputes. We will never in any circumstance be the first to use force. <p> 6 The member states of the North Atlantic Alliance propose to the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization a joint declaration in which we solemnly state that we are no longer adversaries and reaffirm our intention to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or from acting in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other C.S.C.E. member states to join us in this commitment to non-aggression. <p> 7 In that spirit, and to reflect the changing political role of the Alliance, we today invite President Gorbachev on behalf of the Soviet Union, and representatives of the other Central and Eastern European countries, to come to Brussels and address the North Atlantic Council. <p> We today also invite the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the Hungarian Republic, the Republic of Poland, the People 's Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to come to NATO, not just to visit, but to establish regular diplomatic liaison with NATO. This will make it possible for us to share with them our thinking and deliberations in this historic period of change. <p> 8 Our alliance will do its share to overcome the legacy of decades of suspicion. We are ready to intensify military contacts, including those of NATO Military Commanders, with Moscow and other Central and Eastern European capitals. <p> 9 We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Moscow and meet with Soviet leaders. <p> 10 Military leaders from throughout Europe gathered earlier this year in Vienna to talk about their forces and doctrine. NATO proposes another such meeting this autumn to promote common understanding. Wrole of the intend to establish an entirely different quality of openness in Europe, including an agreement on " open skies. " <p> 11 The significant presence of North American conventional and U.S. nuclear forces in Europe demonstrates the underlying political compact that binds North America 's fate to Europe 's democracies. But, as Europe changes, we must profoundly alter the way we think about defense. <p> 12 To reduce our military requirements, sound arms control agreements are essential. That is why we put the highest priority on completing this year the first treaty to reduce and limit conventional armed forces in Europe along with the completion of a meaningful C.S.B.M. confidence and security building measures package. These talks should remain in continuous session until the work is done. Yet we hope to go further. We propose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks should begin with the same membership and mandate, with the goal of building on the current agreement with additional measures, including measures to limit manpower in Europe. With this goal in mind, a commitment will be given at the time of signature of the C.F.E. Treaty concerning the manpower levels of a unified Germany. <p> 13 Our objective will be to conclude the negotiations on the follow-on to C.F.E. and C.S.B.M. 's as soon as possible and looking to the follow-up meeting of the C.S.C.E. to be held in Helsinki in 1992. We will seek through new conventional arms control negotiations, within the C.S.C.E. framework, further far-reaching measures in the 1990 's to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed forces in Europe, so as to prevent any nation from maintaining disproportionate military power on the continent. NATO 's High Level Task Force will formulate a detailed position for these follow-on conventional arms control talks. We will make provisions as needed for different regions to redress disparities and to ensure that no one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will explore broader arms control and confidence-building opportunities. This is an ambitious agenda, but it matches our goal : enduring peace in Europe. <p> 14 As Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe and a treaty limiting conventional armed forces is implemented, the Alliance 's integrated force structure and its strategy will change fundamentally to include the following elements : <p> * NATO will field smaller and restructured active forces. These forces will be highly mobile and versatile so that Allied leaders will have maximum flexibility in deciding how to respond to a crisis. It will rely increasingly on multinational corps made up of national units. <p> * NATO will scale back the readiness of its active unitsreducing training requirements and the number of exercises. <p> * NATO will rely more heavily on the ability to build up larger forces if and when they might be needed. <p> 15 To keep the peace, the Alliance must maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, based in Europe, and kept up to date where necessary. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed that none of its weapons will ever be used except in self-defense and that we seek the lowest and most stable level of nuclear forces needed to secure the prevention of war. <p> 16 The political and military changes in Europe, and the prospects of further changes, now allow the Allies concerned to go further. They will thus modify the size and adapt the tasks of their nuclear deterrent forces. They have concluded that, as a result of the new political and military conditions in Europe, there will be a significantly reduced role for sub-strategic nuclear systems of the shortest range. They have decided specifically that, once negotiations begin on short-range nuclear forces, the Alliance will propose, in return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its nuclear artillery shells from Europe. <p> 17 New negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of short-range nuclear forces should begin shortly after a C.F.E. agreement is signed. The Allies concerned will develop an arms control framework for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer nuclear weapons, and the diminished need for sub-strategic nuclear systems of the shortest range. <p> 18 Finally, with the total withdrawal of Soviet stationed forces and the implementation of a C.F.E. agreement, the Allies concerned can reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons. These will continue to fulfill an essential role in the overall strategy of the Alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are no circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military action might be discounted. However, in the transformed Europe, they will be able to adopt a new NATO strategy making nuclear forces truly weapons of last resort. <p> 19 We approve the mandate given in Turnberry to the North Atlantic Council in Permanent Session to oversee the ongoing work on the adaptation of the Alliance to the new circumstances. It should report its conclusions as soon as possible. <p> 20 In the context of these revised plans for defense and arms control, and with the advice of NATO Military Authorities and all member states concerned, NATO will prepare a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where appropriate, towards a reduced forward presence and modifying " flexible response " to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons. In that connection, NATO will elaborate new force plans consistent with the revolutionary changes in Europe. NATO will also provide a forum for Allied consultation on the upcoming negotiations on short-range nuclear forces. <p> 21 The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should become more prominent in Europe 's future, bringing together the countries of Europe and North America. We support a C.S.C.E. Summit later this year in Paris which would include the signature of a C.F.E. agreement and would set new standards for the establishment, and preservation, of free societies. It should endorse, inter alia : <p> * C.S.C.E. principles on the right to free and fair elections ; <p> * C.S.C.E. commitments to respect and uphold the rule of law ; <p> * C.S.C.E. guidelines for enhancing economic cooperation, based on the development of free and competitive market economies ; and <p> * C.S.C.E. cooperation on environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Summit in Paris decide how the C.S.C.E. can be institutionalized to provide a forum for wider political dialogue in a more united Europe. We recommend that C.S.C.E. governments establish : <p> * A program for regular consultations among member governments at the Heads of State and Government or Ministerial level, at least once each year, with other periodic meetings of officials to prepare for and follow up on these consultations ; <p> * A schedule of C.S.C.E. review conferences once every two years to assess progress toward a Europe whole and free ; <p> * A small C.S.C.E. secretariat to coordinate these meetings and conferences ; <p> * A C.S.C.E. mechanism to monitor elections in all the C.S.C.E. countries, on the basis of the Copenhagen Document ; <p> * A C.S.C.E. Center for the Prevention of Conflict that might serve as a forum for exchanges of military information, discussion of unusual military activities, and the conciliation of disputes involving C.S.C.E. member states ; and <p> * A C.S.C.E. parliamentary body, the Assembly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg, and include representatives of all C.S.C.E. member states. <p> The sites of these new institutions should reflect the fact that the newly democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe form part of the political structures of the new Europe. <p> 23 Today, our Alliance begins a major transformation. Working with all the countries of Europe, we are determined to create enduring peace on this continent.
