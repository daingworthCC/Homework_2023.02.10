3046241 <p> Office workers in many California cities appear to be in higher demand than their bosses. <p> Labor experts say experienced office help is getting increasingly hard to find, despite the recent economic slowdown. Meanwhile, many companies have been trying to trim executive payrolls to control costs. <p> " We 're seeing a lot of bidding for secretaries and administrative assistants, " said Fred Cannon, an economist at BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco. " Companies have been cutting middle-management jobs, but they still need more people to get the basic services done. " <p> One result appears to be higher pay for office workers. A survey by the Thomas Temporaries personnel service found that San Francisco-area employers are paying newly hired secretaries on average of $ 1,957 a month this year, up nearly 13 percent from an average of $ 1,738 a year ago. The average salary for a general typist with three years experience went up about 19 percent to $ 1,825 a month. <p> The findings from the company 's annual job-market survey were based on telephone interviews in November with 1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula. <p> The pay increases are far above the average of about 5 percent expected for the California workforce as a whole this year. The latest occupational wage data from the U.S. Labor Department showed office-clerical workers in San Francisco were being paid a modest 4.6 percent more in March 1989 than in March 1988. By comparison, unskilled factory workers suffered a 1.1 percent decline in pay. <p> Unlike the Thomas Temporaries survey, which focused on recently hired employees, the government survey covered the entire clerical workforce and so may have diluted evidence of employers bidding up wages to attract new people. <p> On the other hand, the private survey was much smaller, and it did not poll the same companies each year. Thus, it may have overstated the office-worker pay increases. Even so, experts said the trend is unmistakeable. <p> " Good applicants have their pick, " said Wanda Lee, vice president of human resources at FHP Inc., a health-maintenance organization based in Orange County. " It 's a sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current national chairwoman of the Society for Human Resource Management, said that in some of the state 's hotter job markets, " you can find an executive, with less cost per hire, than you can fill a front-office position. " <p> Experts noted that more and more women have been deserting the so-called " pink ghetto " of office work for other careers. Like nursing and teaching, many office jobs demand a lot for what they pay. <p> " Salaries have been ludicrously low, " said Gloria Busman, interim director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California at Los Angeles. " Considering the skills and talents that are required, even the wardrobe you 're supposed to wear, it 's little wonder women are looking elsewhere. " <p> While technology has cut the demand for some secretarial skills such as shorthand, it has n't done away with the need for knowledgeable office help. Instead, automation has put new demands on office workers. <p> " If someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to use computers, you 're going to do all you can to hold onto that person, " said Steven Glick, vice president of the Bay Area Council, a regional business-supported research group. " The only problem is that if they have all those skills, they 're probably going to want to do something else besides office work. " <p> The many office-worker opportunities are largely a reflection of the fact that unemployment in California is below 5 percent -- a level many economists consider close to " full employment. " <p> " The market is very, very tight, " said Alan Ewalt, the top personnel executive at National Medical Enterprises in Santa Monica. <p> He said the company 's help-wanted ads for office workers draw about 30 percent fewer applicants than five years ago -- and fewer of today 's applicants are qualified. <p> A similar pattern is emerging at Chevron Corp., according to Barbara Locke, who supervises general-employment hiring for the company in San Francisco and San Ramon. She said Chevron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-house training or change job requirements to cope with the situation. <p> " There are fewer people interested in doing this kind of work for a living, " she said. " It 's taking us longer to fill our jobs. It 's not a crisis situation right now, but I see it getting worse every month. " <p> The market for most office jobs varies region by region, so salaries vary considerably. With the high cost of housing in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, many companies continue to move back-office functions to the suburbs and further inland. <p> But rapid job growth is driving up pay scales in outlying areas, too. <p> The Thomas Temporaries survey found, for example, that a beginning typist in San Bernardino got nearly 9 percent higher pay this year compared with 1989.
