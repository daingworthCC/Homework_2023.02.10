4198441 <p> In creating for the future, architecture comes with lasting and costly consequences. So Andre Brumfield, firmwide director of planning and urban design at architectural firm Gensler in Chicago, starts with the individual. <p> Whether he 's working with his core group in Chicago or teams across multiple offices, tackling city master plans or neighborhood revitalization, Brumfield explains how he gets the best creativity from a diversity of people and approaches. <p> Q : How do you define creativity for your business? <p> A : Design goes beyond buildings. It 's how one building relates to another building, and how it meets the street, and how that street ties those buildings together, and how that builds a neighborhood or city, and how design can influence our built environments as a whole or a series of pieces that work together. <p> Andre Brumfield <p> Antonio Perez / Blue Sky <p> Brumfield works in the Chicago office. <p> Brumfield works in the Chicago office. <p>( Antonio Perez / Blue Sky) <p> Q : How does that affect your creative approach? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, says, " I 'm not an architect or an urban designer, " but then they give their opinion -- and they should. We all live in architectural and urban environments. <p> I always think about what I want a place to be like when I walk through a space, what I want those interactive moments to be. It 's what we experience as users. I 'm always thinking about the end-user because we 're all end-users. We may not have designed it, but we know what makes a great place or neighborhood environment. <p> Q : In what ways do changes in technology affect your creative thinking? <p> A : We 've been so overwhelmed with data that some designers have a hard time distinguishing what direction they should go. It 's easier to press a button and come up with a beautiful rendering and buildings. But how real is that, and how does it get implemented, and if it is implemented, how do you make sure it does n't fail? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interactive 's Fjord Design and Innovation agency in Chicago, leads research within a team of more than... <p> If you want great ideas for digital design, start without your computer. Better yet, draw with your hands and work out in the open. <p> Martha Cotton?, group design research director for Accenture Interactive 's Fjord Design and Innovation agency in Chicago, leads research within a team of more than... <p>( Kate MacArthur) <p> The last thing you want is to use all this big data and find out it 's lying to you. You can never be dependent upon the data. You have to prove the data and re-prove the data and have the right partners with you, not only on the design team but also on the client side, constantly helping you look at this in different ways. <p> Q : How do you build a creative team? <p> A : I like non-traditional approaches -- non-traditional people who like to look at the same set of lenses with you, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problem-solving with you. I 'm not looking for a carbon copy of me. <p> If I bring a solution from the front door, someone else brings it through the back door, someone else the roof and another the second floor -- that diversity of thinking as it relates to design is what I 'm looking for. Who I might have brought on today that walked in the door, the next person I 'm looking for is someone different than that person. <p> One person may get at one solution and get stuck. Another person who might not have been able to come up with an idea initially can pick up the ball and work collaboratively. I learn from them. We all learn from each other. <p> Q : What do you look for when hiring creative talent? <p> A : Some of the most creative people I 've hired, you just did n't see it in interview initially. You saw glimpses of it when you took a chance, and then they blew you away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit 10 items you wanted, but it turns out they were n't the right fit for a number of reasons. There 's no template, but there 's a baseline of skills.
