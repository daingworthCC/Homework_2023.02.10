3005641 <p> Harold Evans was brought to Random House eight months ago with a mandate from its owner, S.. I. Newhouse, to revamp a publisher that was scarcely profitable. Since then, drastic changes in staff and style have left no doubt that Mr. Evans takes this mission seriously. He seems to have provoked resentment and admiration in equal measure. <p> Moving with a dispatch to which a conservative industry is unaccustomed, the former British newspaperman has appointed a new director of marketing, a new associate publisher, a new executive editor, a new creative director and a new executive art director. Several people have been quietly eased out. Mr. Evans, a man never much interested in the status quo, has also committed Random House to broadening its publishing in business, science, art and current events. <p> " It needed to be re-energized, " the publisher said of the division he took over from Joni Evans. " The list was too narrow. I want to make this house genuinely ' random ' and eclectic. And in a place that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to be more profitable. " A Literary Symbol <p> Much is at stake. Founded in 1927 by Bennett Cerf, Random House has embodied excellence since it published Joyce 's " Ulysses " in 1934. Because it is a literary symbol as much as a publishing division, trying to change it is potentially treacherous. <p> Moreover, with sales of about $100 million, it accounts for more than 10 percent of the revenue of Random House Inc. Its success is therefore important to the overall performance of the company which is owned by Mr. Newhouse 's Advance Publications and has been run for the last 18 months by Alberto Vitale, who was brought in to replace Robert L. Bernstein and to bring cohesion and greater profitability. <p> Because books generally take years to write, altering the character of a publishing house is a slow process. The current list, a reflection of the work of Mr. Evans 's predecessor, suggests that this impish and boundlessly enthusiastic former editor of The Times and The Sunday Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works by James A. Michener, Paul Theroux, Wilbur Smith, Diane Ackerman and Ann Beattie. <p> Still, Mr. Evans, 62 years old, wants to do things differently. His gritty, forthright style can ruffle feathers. <p> Some editors, who insisted on anonymnity, said Mr. Evans has involved himself in all aspects of Random House 's activities, from editing book jacket copy to suggesting promotional schemes like advertising current-affairs books on the news, rather than the book, pages of newspapers. <p> This style has led to clashes with a few people, among them Janice Donnaud, who departed earlier this year and will be replaced this week as associate publisher by Walter L. Weintz, the former head of the United States office of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. of Italy. <p> With Ms. Donnaud went her close friend Peter Gethers, the former head of Villard Books, which, along with Times Books, is also overseen by Mr. Evans. Mr. Gethers is now an editor at large for Villard. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in Random House 's marketing, promotion and graphics, have also gone. Only on the editorial side, where Jason Epstein, Joseph M. Fox and Robert Loomis remain, has there been relative stability. <p> Mr. Evans said that when he took over he found dissension that was " acute and unproductive " and that this problem had to be resolved. ' The Berlin Wall ' <p> But inevitably, these staff changes have led to griping. So too did Mr. Evans 's decision to close off the door between his office and the corridor, insuring that visitors have to go through his secretary 's office. The closed-off door has become known as " the Berlin Wall. " <p> It is seen by some editors as a symbol of the fact that they sometimes find the publisher difficult to reach. His deep involvement in a just-published fast book on the gulf war called " Triumph in the Desert " left some feeling he was distracted. <p> Over all, in the corridors of Random House Inc., Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when he took over Alfred A. Knopf from Robert A. Gottlieb in 1987. After a rocky start, Mr. Mehta has been highly successful. Evans Thoroughly Backed <p> In establishing his position, Mr. Evans has an advantage over Mr. Mehta, the Indian-born, British-educated publisher of Knopf. Mr. Metha did not have the confidence or support of the company 's former chief executive, Mr. Bernstein, but Mr. Evans is firmly backed by Mr. Vitale. <p> " Harry has a zillion strengths that he brings to the party, " Mr. Vitale said in an interview. " He has tremendous enthusiasm and creativity and a determination to explore any avenue available to make a book successful. The fact is, change is always a bit of a trauma in a traditional trade house. " <p> Certainly, there are plenty of people with natural interests in fostering criticism of Mr. Evans, who is married to Tina Brown, the editor of Conde Nast 's Vanity Fair, another property of Mr. Newhouse. Mr. Evans was offered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans, no relation, discovered that she would be replaced, people familiar with the negotiations said. She moved on to a smaller new imprint, Turtle Bay Books, but her allies at Random House are numerous and some of them are angry. Resentments and Rivalries <p> Moreover, although he was briefly editor in chief of the small Atlantic Monthly Press, Mr. Evans has more experience in newspapers and magazines than books. In a house where many editors have vast experience, some resentment and jibes were inevitable. <p> Other editors emphasize what they see as a growing rivalry between Mr. Evans and Mr. Mehta. Both publishers are re-introducing a line of classics : Knopf with the Everyman Library, which it is bringing out this year, and Random House with the Modern Library, which is to come out next year. <p> Mr. Evans, however, said his jousting with Mr. Mehta was no more than " literary cricket, " and Mr. Mehta also downplayed any tension. <p> Mr. Evans said : " Random House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a superb publisher over a narrower area. Our challenge is to be an equally superb publisher over a wider range. " Doomsayers May Be Confounded <p> It is a big challenge. But the signs are that Mr. Evans 's quick insights and bubbling enthusiasm may well confound the doomsayers and bring success with innovation, just as they did at The Sunday Times, where he was considered a brilliant editor, and at his previous job as founding editor of the very successful Conde Nast Traveler magazine. <p> The son of a Lancashire engine driver, Mr. Evans is used to battling for success and combines a determined nature with editorial flair.. He already has had several successes. He has concluded 10-year deals to publish the photographs of Richard Avedon and of Robert Mapplethorpe -- books that will take Random House into the photographic area in an unprecedented way. In the business field, he recently won a tough negotiation for a much-sought nonfiction book by David Dorsey, " The Force, " which follows the success of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other difficult transactions, like the one for Marlon Brando 's memoirs, he has shown an ability to win highly competitive negotiations. <p> Mr. Evans has an irrepressible nature. He has the eclectic gadfly mind of the journalist. His natural gait is a lope rather than a walk. He gets as excited about designing type for large-print books or about revamping Random House 's medical publishing( where he has appointed a new editor, Betsy Rapoport) as he does about a first novel or his success in arranging for the simultaneous release of " Triumph in the Desert " as an ABC videocassete and as a book. <p> " If a brilliant trade house publisher is someone who gets the best books under contract and then makes sure their potential is fully exploited, then Harry is superb, " Mr. Weintz said. <p> Mr. Evans has a vision of publishing everything from poetry to blockbusters with distinctive panache. His staff changes, particularly the hiring of Bridget Marmion away from Farrar, Straus &; Giroux as director of marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House 's business. Publishing for Mr. Evans is quite unabashedly an act of commerce. Innovative Advertising <p> For " Beast, " the story of a giant octopus that was written by Peter Benchley, the author of " Jaws, " Mr. Evans is advertising with banners on beaches and a slogan that says, " There 's something in the water. " <p> For a biography of George Bernard Shaw, Mr. Evans is organizing a festival of Shaw plays. <p> " I could have just sat here and let things tick over and been immensely popular, " Mr. Evans said. " But I 've had to make a lot of necessary changes, and there 's been some rockiness with all the comings and goings. But my new team is now the best there is in publishing. "
