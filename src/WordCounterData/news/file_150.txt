3031041 <p> For 27 years, the Concorde represented all that the Jet Age seemed to offer. <p> Looking more like a space shuttle than a jetliner, it rocketed celebrities and tycoons across the Atlantic with supersonic speed and style. It lifted air travel to high art, made New York and Paris almost neighbors, and compressed time and space in a way that suggested anything was possible. Concorde prototypes flew the same year the United States reached the moon. <p> This year, a century after the Wright Brothers ' first flight, British Airways and Air France will retire their Concordes because of falling demand and rising costs. The jets will be turned over to museums. <p> Thursday 's announcement comes three years after a catastrophic Concorde crash in Paris killed all aboard. The decision to park the planes seems tied to today 's painful business realities : Trans-Atlantic travel is off 25% from a year ago. The Iraq war has ratcheted up fuel prices. The 100-seat Concorde uses as much fuel as a Boeing 747 jumbo jet that has four times the passenger capacity. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jets, two. <p> Meanwhile, advances in other technologies have outdistanced aerospace innovation. The seemingly endless abilities of the Internet have made doing trans-Atlantic business in person less critical. Companies, even the rich, find it hard to justify spending more than $ 6,000 for a 3 1/2-hour Concorde flight when a 6- or 7-hour flight can be bought for as little as $ 200 round trip in coach, and even business class from New York to London is $ 3,800. <p> Economically, airlines ca n't justify the Concorde anymore. This sleek symbol of the future has become an anachronism in an era when saving money seems more important than saving time. <p> " It 's a sad day in many ways, " British Airways CEO Rod Eddington told the BBC. " Concorde changed the nature of commercial aviation. " <p> However, " if you 're laying people off and telling people in your business to tighten your belt, senior executives find it inconsistent to go to the airport and get on a Concorde rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sale to try to fill the plane 's remaining flights. Round-trip fares range from $ 2,999 to $ 5,499, which includes one way on the Concorde and one way on a conventional jet. <p> A stunning sight <p> The Concorde was a conceptual dream in the early ' 60s, even as the USA was engaged in the space race. <p> Prototypes of the needle-nose bird were shown publicly in 1967, and British Airways and Air France began passenger flights in 1976. The aircraft inspired awe : It flew at twice the speed of sound, about 1,300 miles per hour, at an altitude of up to 60,000 feet. Six flight attendants lavished luxurious service on a maximum of 100 passengers. <p> Its fastest London-New York crossing took 2 hours, 53 minutes. Over the years, it flew to Washington, Miami, Rio de Janeiro, New York, London and Paris. <p> " It was like riding a thoroughbred race horse or driving a Maserati, " says former Concorde Captain Jock Lowe. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, lot of power. It could do things only fighter planes could do. " He remembers many luminary passengers : former president Richard Nixon, Britain 's Queen Elizabeth, and " just about every film star you can think of. " <p> The first time the Concorde landed in Toronto, during the early ' 80s, " three-quarters of a million people turned out just to see the plane, " he says. " People just loved to look at Concorde. It 's designed perfectly. It 's an artist 's dream. " <p> Inside the cabin, the service was dreamy, too. <p> " It was an extraordinary experience, " says New York publicist Adam Brecht, who first flew the Concorde to London in December 2001. The food, particularly the cheeses and desserts, and service were impeccable, as was the " glamour factor. I noticed Queen Noor( of Jordan) two rows in front of me, and she was playing computer solitaire, " he recalls. <p> The Concorde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's rather sad " that the Concorde 's days are near an end, said actor Roger Moore. As James Bond, Moore flies from Paris to Rio de Janeiro on a Concorde in the 1979 film Moonraker. Moore says he flew the Concorde 20 or 30 times, and what he 'll miss most is the speed, but adds, " The caviar was always a little bit better. " <p> It was Concorde 's exclusive allure that attracted celebrities, says Gordon Roxburgh, a TV network technician in London who runs the fan Web site ConcordeSST.com. Movie stars or musicians could work all day in London, pop aboard the Concorde and arrive in New York -- an hour earlier than they left. <p> It was first class all the way : special Concorde lounges at the airports, the best foods, the best wines. <p> " It 's Britain at its best, the Rolls Royce of flying, " says John de Lande Long, a financial adviser in New York who estimates he has flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he has spotted Alan Alda, Prince and Phil Collins aboard. <p> " We thought if we could go faster, we would only be more successful : The faster we went, the more successful we would be, " Lowe recalls. " Unfortunately, it did n't work out that way financially. " <p> Not surprisingly, the airlines ' Concorde announcements brought immediate controversy Thursday. Sir Richard Branson, CEO of British Airways ' rival Virgin Atlantic, hinted he might try for some of them. <p> " We have been flooded with calls from the public, including British Airways staff, asking us to see if we can keep Concorde flying, " Branson said in a statement. " If Virgin Atlantic, with its lower cost base, believes it can make a success of it, we will be asking British Airways to give us the planes for the same price that they were given them " -- one British pound. <p> British Airways does n't want to sell the fleet to another operator. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and the USA, including the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. Boeing has asked about one for its museum in Seattle. <p> Concerns about safety <p> In July 2000, when the economic boom was filling planes, an Air France Concorde crashed shortly after takeoff from Paris. All 109 on the plane and four people on the ground were killed. The airline grounded all its Concordes. British Airways suspended Concorde operations two months later. <p> Investigators traced the accident to a metal strip on the runway, probably from a Continental Airlines plane. They believe the strip damaged a Concorde tire and debris punctured the fuel tank, starting a fire. <p> The airlines spent millions reinforcing the Concordes ' fuel tanks and installed improved tires. But the retrofitted fleet did n't get back in the air until November 2001, when post-Sept. 11, 2001, demand for trans-Atlantic travel had plummeted. <p> More recently, the Concorde fleet has been showing its age. In December, a British Airways Concorde lost part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In February, an Air France Concorde had a similar incident. At almost 30 years old, the fleet is aging and in need of costly maintenance to remain safe. <p> Where 's the innovation? <p> Dick Rutan, the pilot best known for flying the futuristic Voyager plane around the world in 1986, says the retirement of the Concorde is the latest example of a vacuum in aerospace innovation. <p> " Some of our high-technology airplanes are being retired, and there 's no propensity toward improving them and moving on to the next generation of airplanes, " he says. <p> He points out that in the 1950s and 1960s, aircraft were developed that fly at about three-quarters the speed of sound. " Thirty years later, we are still driving around at a slow speed, " he says. " The only advancements we have made are in avionics and electronics. " <p> The space shuttle is another example. " It 's embarrassing. They want to fly an antique for the next 20 years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 60s and said we 're going to the moon, not because it 's easy but because it 's hard? " <p> But that was a different time and a different economy. There were no corporate jets or Internet connections or cellphones. <p> Roxburgh, the Web site designer, thinks the Concorde 's retirement has been hastened by other new technology, such as video conferencing, which can replace the mad dash across the Atlantic for a business meeting. <p> Without the Concorde, he says, " The world will be a slower place.
