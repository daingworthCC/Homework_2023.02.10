4190041 <p> The trio accounted for all of the scoring as the Huskies edged the host Redhawks 2-1 to win the Best of the West Tournament at Memorial Stadium in Naperville. <p> DeStefano, a senior, gave the Redhawks a 1-0 lead in the 11th minute, but Litzmann and Bromagen scored eight minutes apart later in the first half. <p> " It 's just kind of how these games go, " DeStefano said. " It 's always super competitive between us and North, no matter how the teams are. <p> " They have really good players up top and we knew they were probably going to get up on us one time during the night. So we tried to get more( goals) against them but we could n't. " <p> It was n't for lack of trying. The game went down to the wire and featured 31 shots, entertaining a large crowd led by enthusiastic student sections. <p> The Huskies( 4-1-2) and Redhawks( 4-1-2) both field lineups featuring many first-year starters and varsity newcomers. <p> Players like Bromagen, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crosstown rivalry. <p> " It was great, quite the scenario, " Bromagen said. " I 'm glad to have my first goal on varsity. <p> " I 've been in the program for so many years now and it 's great to get the first goal, especially at Central against them. " <p> The game was merely the beginning of what could be another thrilling trilogy. The teams will meet again Saturday in a DuPage Valley Conference matchup at Memorial Stadium and possibly in the state playoffs in October. <p> " I assume we 'll play them three times, " Naperville North coach Jim Konrad said. " It 's going to be a one-goal game every time we play them this year. <p> " The good thing is that the boys are so friendly. All these kids play together in club and you could tell that, as much as they wanted to win, it was a hard game but the kids respect each other. " <p> What the future holds is anyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six Best of the West titles. But their previous championships, in 2011 and 2015, were followed by upset losses to the Redhawks in the sectional final. <p> Depending on whom you ask, the short wait for the next meeting can be construed as an advantage for either team. <p> " I kind of like the fact that it 's close because it leaves their sense of doubt in their head, that we came here one week earlier and beat them, " Bromagen said. " But one or three weeks, it does n't really matter in the grand scheme of things because we 're just going to come out here and play as hard as we can. " <p> The coaches would prefer a larger gap, but the players are relishing it. <p> " It makes it fun that you get to play them twice, especially now that we lost, " DeStefano said. " In a way it helps because now we know how they play. <p> " They 're a different team from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so I think we 'll have a better chance next time. " <p> The teams appear evenly matched. The Huskies have one of the state 's best players in Chris Sullivan, while Redhawks goalkeeper Wesley Sprague has been outstanding. <p> " We lost, but I was happy with the way we played, " Naperville Central coach Troy Adams said. " When we play the way we want to play, we 're the better team. When we get dragged into some things( the Huskies) want to do, we 're in trouble. "
