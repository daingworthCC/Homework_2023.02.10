3070441 <p> Most of the major one-artist museums in the United States are devoted to figures such as Salvador Dali, Georgia O'Keeffe and Andy Warhol, who are as much icons as artists and enjoy widespread appeal. <p> But Clyfford Still, who is soon to be the focus of a museum in Denver, is different. While he was a pivotal <p> figure in the history of post-World War II American art, most people outside the art world have never heard of him. <p> " How do you take a huge body of work and create an aura around this individual now that he 's got a museum to give him that kind of status? " said Douglas Dreishpoon, senior curator of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y. <p> " And can it be done with a single edifice and a series of programs that focus exclusively on this artist? That 's the big challenge. " <p> It 's one that the museum 's board is confronting <p> as it begins choosing an <p> architect, envisioning the institution 's look and function, and pondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to be broken in 2007 for the privately funded museum, which will sit immediately west of the Denver Art Museum 's expansion between West 12th and West 13th avenues on Bannock Street. It will house about 90 percent of Still 's career output - more than 2,500 paintings and drawings - plus his potentially rich archives. <p> With the help of a Still nephew who lives in Denver, officials were able in August 2004 to persuade the artist 's widow, Patricia A. Still, to donate his holdings to the city of Denver. When she died last year, the museum received a bequest of 400 more works plus the archives. <p> Besides trying to attract more than just Still cognoscenti, museum leaders face further challenges imposed by Still 's will and the donation agreement between the city and the Still estate. Together, they forbid such amenities as a restaurant and auditorium. The museum is also banned from collecting or showing any other artist 's work. <p> Do these conditions irrevocably hamstring this institution? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find new ways to present one artist 's work and develop new definitions of what a fruitful museum experience can be? <p> There is no doubt that Still( 1904-1980) was a central figure in the 1940s and ' 50s development of abstract expressionism along with Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. <p> In a 1967 interview, artist Robert Motherwell assessed Still 's 1945 show at Peggy Guggenheim 's influential New York gallery. <p> " I must say, it is to Still 's credit - his was the show, of all those early shows of ours, that was the most original. A bolt out of the blue, " he said. <p> Although respected in the art world, Still never gained the fame of many of his peers. He was something of a curmudgeon and disliked dealing with museums and collectors, the very people he needed to build his name. <p> In part because of this detachment, no mystique grew up around him like Pollock, whose drip method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who played up her mythic image as a solitary woman in the vast Southwest. <p> Through the museum 's work and inevitable books and articles that will arrive as scholars finally get access to material off limits for decades, project director Dean Sobel believes Still 's profile will grow. <p> He does n't see Still 's popularity equaling O'Keeffe 's, but Sobel thinks it could some day rival Pollock 's. <p> Certainly, Still has gained a following among visitors in Buffalo ; the Albright-Knox is a center of Still scholarship. It has been the largest public Still collection, with 33 paintings. <p> Even so, Barbara Buhler Lynes, curator of Santa Fe 's Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, believes that Still 's abstractions will be tough for many people to understand and appreciate. <p> " O'Keeffe 's work is not difficult, " she said. " People love it. But when you 're dealing with the degree of abstraction and the level of abstract ideas that are lying behind abstract-expressionism, this is n't something that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A partner in the DAM <p> Lynes and Dreishpoon said the key is to provide context for Still 's work, relating him to the other abstract-expressionists and placing him within the flow of American art history. <p> " Otherwise, they 're going to denature his true worth, " Dreishpoon said. " It 's going to be a mausoleum of one artist 's vision of what? What is this? " <p> Visitors entering the O'Keeffe museum first encounter a gallery of photographs showing the person behind the art they are about to see. An adjoining room offers an overview film on the artist 's life and work. <p> Sobel said the Still Museum will no doubt have similar orientation rooms, and it will probably have either a gallery devoted to some of his archival materials or intersperse them with the exhibition of the artworks. <p> But inhibiting the museum 's ability to provide that all-important context is the ban on showing Still 's work along with that of other artists, something the O'Keeffe and Warhol museums regularly do. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proximity to the Denver Art Museum and the obvious opportunities for collaboration. <p> And that 's exactly what Dianne Vanderlip, the DAM 'S curator of modern and contemporary art, plans to do. <p> " Like I 'll do a show of what all the other A-E( abstract-expressionist) guys were doing in ' 52, and at the Still Museum they 'll do a show of what Still was doing, so you can kind of wrap him into that package, " she said. <p> Vanderlip is pursuing acquisitions that will bolster her museum 's spotty holdings in abstract-expressionism and post-World War II American art. High on the wish list are works by artists such as de Kooning and David Smith. <p> A building befitting Still <p> At the same time, the Still Museum will be able to spotlight other artists and other aspects of art history with lectures, symposia and events that do not have to focus only on Still. <p> Critical to the success or failure of the institution will be its building, which Sobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be designed by a nationally or internationally known architect ; major names already have made inquiries. <p> Which architect would be most appropriate? How should the building look and feel? What kind of galleries will best display Still 's works with their interlocking, jagged-edged areas of color? <p> Those are questions the museum 's board is grappling with as it organizes an architect search and works toward assembling a list of finalists by summer. <p> Vanderlip envisions a building with compact, meditative and well-proportioned spaces. <p> She sees " very quiet architecture, with spaces that provide vistas to the different periods of painting so that you can move historically through his life and you can always kind of see what is around the corner. " <p> Dreishpoon thinks the galleries should be larger, even " palatial " in size, with ample natural lighting. " They 're heroic works, so to put them in a space that 's at all claustrophobic is n't going do them justice, " he said. <p> Unlike other art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate ever-evolving collections, the Still collection is likely to change little if at all. <p> Brit Probst, a principal with Davis Partnership, a Denver architectural firm collaborating on the Denver Art Museum addition and a permanent home for the Museum of Contemporary Art/Denver, said an architect will be able to custom design the spaces to the size and even aesthetic of Still 's works. <p> " You have a building whose architecture can really be didactic, " Probst said. " You can try to convey a sense of the artist 's work. " <p> Although the architect will have to adjust the building 's sightlines and configuration to accommodate nearby buildings such as the DAM 's jutting expansion, Probst is confident the structure will boast its own distinctive look. <p> " Trial and error " <p> " I think there 's going to be a strong desire by the selection committee to have an architecture that stands apart from the other buildings so that you do n't in anyway subsume the identity of the Clyfford Still Museum, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions than answers as leaders develop the new museum. <p> Dreishpoon said some of the those questions might remain unanswered until months or even years after it opens. <p> " It 's going to be an empirical process : experimentation and trial and error, " he said.
