4193841 <p> The Hawks have hit the posts with 17 shots and have had one go off the crossbar. Defenseman Cody Franson said the Hawks can only chalk it up to bad puck luck. <p> " One of those posts happens to go bar and in, rather than bar and out, that can change everything, " Franson said. " You hit a lot of posts, some guys start to get that snakebitten kind of feeling when you go through a little drought and ca n't score. It 's those shots that make you lose sleep at night. " <p> Quenneville had a slightly different take. He said the high amount of iron hit means the Hawks have to be more efficient when they get scoring chances. <p> " Completing those quality chances, the finish has n't been up to the percentages, " Quenneville said. " Let 's find a way to get back at least that consistency and predictability. " <p> Alex DeBrincat and Patrick Kane are the most unlucky Hawks in that department. DeBrincat has had three hit the post, while Kane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbar. Patrick Sharp and Brandon Saad have each clanged two off the post. <p> When the Hawks do score, they are also scoring them a little differently. <p> They have only four goals off slap shots, tied for 27th in the league. They led that statistic last season with 43, thanks in part to the wicked one-timer of Artemi Panarin, whom they traded to the Blue Jackets in the offseason. Panarin tied for the league lead with Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber with 12 slap-shot goals. <p> Getting the message : The NHL fined winger John Hayden for a double-minor high stick he leveled on the Lightning 's J.T. Brown on Wednesday. It was Hayden 's second double minor in his last three games, but it does n't appear it will cost him any time in Quenneville 's doghouse. He was skating with usual linemates Tommy Wingels and Lance Bouma at practice Friday. <p> Quenneville did say Hayden has to clean up his game. <p> " Something like that, you have to address it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every incident is different, and that play( in Tampa), you can( say he should) be more responsible on that type of play for sure.
