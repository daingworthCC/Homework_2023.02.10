By night, at the crowded, noisy restaurants and new striptease shows, it 's microscopic cocktail dresses. Lots of jewelry sets off invariably blond hair, natural or bleached. <p> For men, it 's Western athletic clothing like Nike and Fila, or Western T-shirts, commonly with American themes : Stars and Stripes, baseball team logos, even one shirt made for " The Great American Smoke-Out " of 1990, worn, of course, by a fashionably slender chain smoker with slicked back hair. Marx Had a Phrase for It <p> All this display, in a period Marx would call " the stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many citizens of the former Soviet Union are scurrying to put enough rubles together to buy food, much less find time for tennis. <p> But there are nouveaux riches in Russia and other former Soviet republics who are rushing toward their notion of trendiness. There is no good information about their numbers or, indeed, their incomes. But Pravda, not exactly a fan of this new class, said recently that their monthly income ranges up to 80,000 rubles, or about $600 at the current exchange rates, compared with the average Russian salary of about 3,500 rubles. <p> Ordinary Russians speak of them simply as " the mafia, " a term that can include anyone from a member of various crime gangs to what a Westerner would merely call a shrewd businessman who is exploiting shortages in the market and making a profit for his trouble. <p> Such executives sometimes call themselves " ventilatory, " because they " beat the air and then sell it, " being simply brokers between people who want goods and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves. The Rich Are Indeed Different <p> " Am I rich? " A paunchy man in a Nike polo shirt rolled the question around his pink cheeks. " I suppose so, compared to others, " he finally said. <p> And how had he become rich? He laughed. " Business, " he said. " Commodities. " And he would say little more, except that he and his wife were having " a well-deserved rest " of nearly three weeks, liberally lubricated with Georgian champagne and French cognac. <p> Did this new wealth embarrass him? " Why? " he said, a bit angry now. " Should n't Russians enjoy themselves, too? " <p> On vacation here, their headquarters is the 2,518-bed Yalta Hotel, built in 1975 for foreign tour groups. With restaurants and bars, tennis courts and a weight room and a huge, heated, sea-water pool, the hotel is now open to anyone who can pay cash.( Generally, only foreigners pay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago the hotel opened a hard-currency casino, with equipment from Baden-Baden, the German resort town that was the site for " The Gambler, " by Dostoyevsky. The casino offers Heineken beer on tap, at $3 a pint. <p> Aleksandr V. Podkopayev, the 34-year-old commercial director, said that with the collapse of the Soviet State Committee on Tourism, the workers of the hotel took over. <p> " We pay the taxes and are essentially independent, " he said. " We make policy, set the rates and arrange the contracts. " Mr. Podkopayev said that if all goes well, the workers will buy the hotel from the state through a stock issue that may include foreign participation. <p> The management has negotiated its own deals with foreign travel companies, especially German ones. But 70 percent of the guests are now citizens of one of the 11 former Soviet republics that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States. Many buy tourist packages or vouchers from their employers, but individual reservations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night for a single room, a Commonwealth citizen pays 1,800 rubles, or about $13, not including meals. <p> Hotel employees speak wistfully of the time when mostly foreigners came. " These new mafia behave very badly, " one employee said, nodding toward a large man with a mustache whose arm enveloped a young woman in sunglasses whose skirt did not stretch quite far enough. <p> But Mr. Podkopayev knows a market when he sees one. " Young people, businessmen and those working in foreign joint ventures want some fun, " he said. " They are doing better and they want quality for their money. That 's why we 're full. We 've opened the casino, some hard-currency shops, and now we 're bringing sophisticated variety shows, like ' Night Stars. ' " Ooo-la-la, Sort Of <p> " Night Stars " is a striptease competition for both sexes. One evening, a table of sophisticated Russian women yawned knowingly about the amateurish performances, but perked up when " Oleg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his black briefs. <p> " This is still a provincial place, " said one woman, whose fingers, ears and neck were coated with silvery jewelry. " It 's African, " she said. " I bought it in Tokyo. " <p> Why was she there? She simply smiled a dreamy sort of smile and turned back to the show. Later, she said dismissively, " They must have dragged the villages for these girls. " <p> Mr. Podkopayev described the audience : " In a way it is the new elite of society. They dress up in the evenings, trying to shock one another and show off. " <p> He admits that the market is sometimes confusing. That day, the hotel had run out of Georgian champagne at 300 rubles a bottle, or less than $2. " The people here drink it like water, " Mr. Podkopayev said. " So we 're bringing in truckloads. " Prices Up, if You Have to Pay <p> Prices are also going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners come for their annual 24-day vacation. Formerly a resort for miners from all over the Soviet Union, it can accommodate 700 people at a time, or about 9,000 from May to October. <p> Compared with last year, prices are up twelvefold, to 7,100 rubles a person. But miners may still buy vouchers at huge discounts, with the difference made up by their mine or trade union. <p> This year, said the director, Valentin A. Ageyev, 80 percent of the vouchers were sold at a 70 percent discount, with the rest either at a 90 percent discount or free. But the mines were reneging on their payments, Mr. Ageyev said, and after laying off 80 of 280 employees, he finally sent telegrams to 100 enterprises. <p> " I sent them a bill, " he said simply. " I told them if they do n't pay by tomorrow, I 'll accept no miners. And you can imagine what a miner would do to his director if there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ageyev has big plans. He and the workers have seized the 38-acre resort and its private cable car to the sea and privatized it, taking over its obligations from the Ukraine Coal Mining Commission. That includes a new and sharply higher rent. This year, he said, the lease was 750,000 rubles ; as of Jan. 1, it will be 6 million. <p> " And it 's clear where we will get this 6 million, " he said. " We have to get it from the pockets of the workers who stay here -- from whom else? " <p> The voucher system itself is anachronistic, he said, especially since miners earn 15,000 to 20,000 rubles a month. " But the old system still holds us, " he said. <p> " Why should a boss spend time finding his workers trousers or a vacation voucher? " he asked. " Our costs are less than half a miner 's monthly salary. The boss would be better off working more efficiently. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new joint-venture hotel, to pull in Western tourists.

" Even the ' Savages ' Pay More <p> Prices have also gone up in nearby Gurzuf, given by Catherine the Great to her favorite, Prince Potemkin. Even in the grand Defense Ministry sanitarium for officers, set in the pretty curving streets, the cost for the standard 24-day stay has just gone up fivefold, to 14,000( $104). <p> But officers may buy vouchers for only 25 percent of the cost( 50 percent for spouses). The rest is still paid by the state. <p> Gurzuf and its pebbled beaches are also known as a summer spot for artists and casual visitors, known locally as " savages, " who rent beds in private houses with rights to use the stove. Last year, a bed for one night was 5 rubles ; this year, it 's 50 rubles, and Gurzuf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, sat in a straw hat on a bench on the nearly empty embankment to watch the sea.

" If you came last year you could n't find a place on the beach to put your leg. You could n't even see the beach for the bodies. <p> " Look at the difference now, " he said, sadly. " Now it costs at least 100 rubles a day for each person, and that does n't even include alcohol. " <p> Suddenly angry, he said : " Tell them how we live now, with sausage 200 rubles a kilo and milk 11 rubles a bottle. It 's robbery! And what kind of milk? It 's so thin you do n't even have to rinse the bottle. " <p> Map of Crimea showing location of Yalta.
