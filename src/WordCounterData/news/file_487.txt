4086941 With the No. 1 draft pick a distinct possibility and a phenom quarterback named Andrew Luck lurking, Tim Tebow took his future into his large hands, his underrated arm and his powerful and elusive legs. # It may have been a stretch, although not by a mile, to suggest the game Sunday was Tebow vs. Luck for status as the Broncos quarterback of the future. # Go ahead, Carolina Panthers. Use that No. 1 pick on Luck, the prototypical, passing-polished quarterback from Stanford - providing the super sophomore declares himself eligible for the NFL draft. # The Broncos will go forward with the raw, unconventional but just-try- # to-stop-him Tebow. # With Tebow exhorting his teammates to a remarkable second-half comeback, the Broncos stunned the Houston Texans 24-23 on Sunday before a large post-Christmas gathering( only 5,717 no-shows in the sellout) at Invesco Field at Mile High. # " He is exactly what you thought coming out of college, " said Gary Kubiak, the Houston head coach and former Broncos offensive coordinator. " He is a winner. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find a way to move the chains. He found a way to win a game today, and that is what this league is about. " # By overcoming a 17-0 halftime deficit, the Broncos blew their chance at receiving the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. # " That guy costs too much money, anyway, " said Brandon Lloyd, the Broncos phenomenally acrobatic receiver. # The 2-13 Panthers clinched the No. 1 pick, a Holy Grail this time because only there does a team figure to have a chance at getting Luck, who has yet to declare his intentions. # He 's not likely coming to Denver. The 4-11 Broncos still would get the No. 2 pick by losing their season finale next week against San Diego. But at No. 2, the discussion about grabbing a defensive player will generate far less debate. # " How many quarterbacks are we supposed to draft? " Broncos defensive end Justin Bannan said. # Whether Tebow can make it as an elite NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such a leap in judgment. Quarterback aficionados go on and on about his long release, his shaky footwork, his inability to quickly read the coverage - as if there 's ever been a rookie quarterback in the 90-year history of the NFL who could. # What Tebow does have are qualities that ca n't be coached. Specifically, is n't escapability a nice asset to have in your quarterback? # " He can beat you with his legs and he can beat you with his arm, " said Broncos running back Correll Buckhalter, who had a fountain of youth game with one touchdown running and another touchdown receiving. " But what I like most about him is the energy he brings to the huddle. That 's a third element that he brings - the energy. " # Tebow threw for 308 yards and a touchdown against the Texans, and also rushed for 27 yards, including a reverse-the-field, 6-yard, go-ahead touchdown with 3:02 remaining. # In both his starting debut last week at Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least showed why he has captivated a football nation the past five years. # " It 's the passion, " Lloyd said, " and it 's funny how it translates to people who do n't play. It 's strange because to us players, it 's expected to play with a lot of passion. But a lot of us do n't play with it. And a lot of us know the difference between guys who really are passionate and guys who are trying to act that way but are chilling out. # " With Tim, when he calls the play I know he 's going to do everything humanly possible to make that play happen. It 's crazy having that kind of confidence in a rookie quarterback. " # It was n't until after the Broncos trailed 17-0 at intermission that the magic of Tebow appeared. He drilled a beautiful 50-yard pass to Jabar Gaffney on the opening drive of the second half, with right tackle Ryan Harris taunting Houston defensive end Mark Anderson every step while following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game the Texans, like most Tebow foes, directed verbal salvos at the quarterback, no doubt with the intention of offending his famous Christian values. # Does Tebow ever retaliate with words of his own? # " No, I am not much of a trash talker, " Tebow said. " I might throw in a ' God bless. " # He brought down the news conference room with that remark. # Tebow led his offense to three scores - touchdown, field goal and touchdown - on his first three second-half possessions, but he needed to make it four-for-four. # It was 23-17 Texans when Tebow huddled up his offense with 7:42 remaining and the ball at his 24. A third-and-10 dump off to Buckhalter gained 22 yards. Then a 15-yard strike on second-and-long to Lloyd. Tebow scrambled for 11. # Tebow had the Texans defense, ranked No. 32 in the league against the pass, rocked back on its heels. # Eventually facing third-and-4 at the Texans 10, an interference call on Glover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an illegal procedure penalty, Tebow did what he does best - avoid a sack, pivot back to his left where the grass was green and no white Texans uniforms were close to catching him. # With fourth-quarter comeback No. 1, Tebow assured the Broncos would not have the No. 1 draft pick. # And without the No. 1 pick, Tebow remains the Broncos future. # Mike Klis : 303-954-1055 or mklis@denverpost.com # -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- # The race for second pick # Victories by Denver and Cincinnati on Sunday clinched the 2011 No. 1 draft pick for Carolina, but the Broncos hold the tiebreaker for the No. 2 pick : # CURRENT PICK, TEAM....
