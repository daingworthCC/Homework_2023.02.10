3061141 <p> Aquestion in any reporter 's preseason interrogation of any coach for any sport is pretty basic. <p> " How many returning starters do you have? " <p> But in volleyball, that question has an offshoot query. <p> " How many club players do you have on your varsity team? " <p> The more players with club experience a team has, the more prepared it is to make a run at the state title. <p> " You are not going to have a team( at the state finals in Hoffman Estates) without stud club players, " said John Kasik, the coach of undefeated and top-ranked Oak Park, which has reached the boys state tournament five times in the six-year history of the event. <p> " You can tell when you go to high school matches who plays club and who does n't, " said Roger Strausberger, the first-year director of Sports Performance, which is located at the Great Lakes Volleyball Center in West Chicago. <p> Oak Park 's team is led by Tom Trantow, Jon Schultz and Nate Werner, all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, many Oak Park players compete in Jim Webster 's Husky Club, which is in its third year. <p> " You still see great volleyball players at the high school level who do n't play club year-round, but they are very rare, " said Mike Mazur, the founder and coach of the Orland Park-based Synergy. <p> All the state champions in the six-year history of the tournament( Naperville North in 1997, Sandburg in 1996, New Trier in 1995, Oak Lawn in 1994, Glenbrook North in 1993 and Richards in 1992) benefited from club athletes. <p> With 108 teams competing in the state tournament this year, up from 73 in the sport 's first year in 1992, boys volleyball has emerged as a legitimate sport for athletes in the spring. Many attribute that success to the parallel growth of club teams. <p> " There 's been a ruboff effect in the last eight years, " Fremd coach Dave Boze said. " There is a different type of volleyball player we are seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ways of the game. " <p> " Us old guys know that as soon as someone is introduced to the game properly, it is self-motivating, " Kasik said. " It is addictive, and it is nice for them to have places to play. " <p> The most obvious benefit of club volleyball is opportunity. Clubs are divided into age brackets -- under 18, under 16 and under 14 -- and there are varying levels of skill within each bracket. <p> " Unlike other traditional sports, the biggest problem is there is no other place for them to play when the season is not going on, " said Jerry Angle, who currently coaches the women 's team at Dominican University in River Forest after spending 15 years at Northwestern and two at Sports Performance and as an Oak Park assistant. <p> " The fundamentals of the game are too tough to teach in that short of time( two weeks) before competition begins for the high school season. In club, you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good volleyball player, playing club is what you are going to do. " <p> " Club background allows a player who loves the game more opportunity to play the game he loves, " said Dennis Bergstedt, the coach of Evergreen Park-based Second City. <p> For boys, club season typically begins in mid-September, with competition starting in November. This allows for six solid weeks of passing, serving, ball-control drills and strategy sessions. <p> " It gives you the ability to see what is going to happen, " Boze said. " You can react to the ball before it is even hit to you. You know what options the other hitter has, and you can anticipate things that you would not necessarily know if you did n't play club. " <p> Among the members of the all-state team last year -- Sandburg 's Kevin Ludden and Ken Regan, Glenbrook South 's Tim O'Brien, York 's Tim Stratton, Naperville North 's Mason Phelps and Oak Park 's Trantow -- all but Stratton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Most all of the people getting write-ups and those being successful are club players, " Strausberger said. <p> The glaring question for all high school coaches is how well the skills learned in club transcend to the varsity floor, where the team member standing next to you often is not a club athlete. <p> " Sometimes high school coaches have more work to do, " Glenbrook South coach Patty Iverson said. " Sometimes it is harder to work( club players) into your system. Sometimes it makes your team better. I 've had it both ways. I know a lot of coaches that had it go both ways. " <p> " Sometimes the club coach says that his way is the best way, and therefore he is telling a kid that way is the only way, " said Mike Hulett, who coaches Evanston 's boys and the first-year Adversity Club in Northfield. <p> Hulett spent four years at Lake Forest-based Shoreline before founding Adversity in 1997. <p> " When practicing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of conflicts in instruction. " As a club coach, I do n't ever say ' right way ' or ' wrong way ' anymore. I just say that at least they have one more option on how to do something. " <p> " When you have club players with non-club players, there is a lot of tolerance and a lot of teaching going on other than what the coach does, " Boze said. " It is peer-to-peer-type coaching, and it is very healthy. " <p> The presence of talented club players on the floor also has the effect of inspiring non-club players. <p> " I think kids create their own pressure because they see the kids who start are club players, " Sandburg coach Joann Holverson said. <p> " Bricks do n't have to hit them, " Providence coach Cindy Olczyk said. " They see good players and see why they are good. It 's because they play club. " <p> Are there any drawbacks to playing club volleyball? <p> A popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or winter sports at their high schools. Time commitments vary by club, but none explicitly force boys to make a choice, and most clubs draw from their surrounding communities. <p> As for skills that directly affect performance on the high school floor, club only helps. But outside of that area, coaches indicated that some of the problems that might develop in players include ego, lack of tolerance for less experienced players, burnout and overuse injuries. <p> And there might be drawbacks within clubs, not counting the cost, which might be an imposition for some players and families. <p> " Just because an athlete plays club -- and this could be club anything -- that does n't necessarily mean that the athlete is going to be much better, " said Bergstedt, who is also an assistant for Brother Rice. " It all depends on what he puts into it. <p> " Club is not a cure-all. The kids must work hard. Also, how good is the team? How successful is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things factor into a kid 's motivation in taking advantage of the opportunities. " <p> " If you are on an elite team, you are going to develop faster, " Holverson said. " If you are on a( third-level) team, you do n't see as much development, and I do n't know if it is necessarily an advantage. " <p> " A kid could get steered into the wrong club, " Boze said. " Then you spend a lot of money and not get anything out of it or run into a poor coach and get a sour taste in your mouth. " <p> But the success stories of club volleyball are more prevalent than the horror stories. And the bottom line is that club allows more young athletes to compete in their chosen sport. Playing is the key. <p> " It all comes down to experience, " Hulett said. <p> Most boys players enter club volleyball knowing that Division I college opportunities are limited, so club becomes a vehicle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guys that I 've coached in the past, they still love the game, " Angle said.
