4086341 The Blue Ridge Parkway slices through Appalachia like a rusty scythe, a crooked spine that courses 469 miles southwest through Virginia and across western North Carolina. # The point is to go slowly, savor the unhurried views and bountiful surprises that seem to lurk beyond every bend and dip in the road. That 's a challenge in a culture that values speed and demands instant gratification. # The historic route -- celebrating its 75th anniversary this year -- connects two of the nation 's great national parks, starting at Rockfish Gap just south of Shenandoah National Park and meandering nearly 500 miles later into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, ending in Cherokee, N.C. # The Blue Ridge -- one of only seven national parkways in the United States -- is designated as a national scenic byway and an " All American Road. " # Rushing through it defeats the purpose, is probably illegal and will only frustrate lead-footed drivers when they hear what they 've missed. The parkway is n't a shortcut. It 's the journey, a destination in itself. # It 's is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's New Deal. Construction on what was originally called the Appalachian Scenic Highway began in 1935 and did n't officially end until 1987. # To toast the old girl as she turns 75, there are food festivals, music events and races being held in nearby towns and villages, many of which bear two names ending in Gap, Hollow or Knob. The celebration culminates with an anniversary festival Sept. 10-12. The festivities honor the history, culture, agriculture and traditions of the region, highlighting everything from molasses and wine to wooly worms and kite-flying, poetry, crafts, fiddling, peaches and fall colors. # Driving the parkway is like awakening in " Leave It to Beaver " America, a time when families would " see the U.S.A. in their Chevrolets. " # The parkway avoids large American cities. Roanoke, Va., population 300,000, is the biggest urban area along its path. Instead, it links together small, mostly unknown communities that before the road was built were geographically inaccessible. # The parkway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops to 25 mph. We did n't see any police during our week-long road trip. Drivers are much more likely to see herds of deer, flocks of wild turkey, vultures and hawks and, if they 're lucky, a black bear. Missing are the ubiquitous, eye-numbing outdoor advertisements blighting the view along the rest of America 's highways. # Along the parkway, drivers pass through bucolic farms and sun-dappled forests, cross over rivers, creeks and rapids, and are treated to astonishing mountain vistas. # Traveling slower not only lowers the blood pressure but opens the senses. Motorists notice the weathered, split-rail fences hugging the road and forming a rustic border that frames this unspooling panorama. The fences are n't just picturesque but functional, protecting wandering livestock. # The blue along the Blue Ridge Parkway employs every shade, from cobalt and indigo to cerulean and azure.

Not far from the parkway is Mount Airy, N.C., a quaint town best known as the inspiration for television 's Mayberry and Andy Griffith 's hometown, which has a museum honoring its favorite son. # This is old country, inhabited as early as 8,000 B.C. by Native American tribes, chiefly the Cherokee. Revolutionary War heroes and early explorers like Daniel Boone strode the paths beneath this narrow road. Civil War skirmishes were fought nearby. The site of Lee 's surrender at Appomattox, Va., is just off the parkway. # But for many Midwesterners, this is new country, a region of haunting hollows united by this predecessor of the interstate highway system. # The parkway brought tourists, who today spend an estimated $2 billion annually along its path. # The parkway also played a role in dispersing the cultural wonders of the region.

The elevation approaches 6,000 feet as the road approaches Asheville. When we traveled it in mid-March, some stretches were closed as road crews trimmed trees that had fallen during a huge snow and ice storm. Luckily, the closures are well marked and the detours not difficult to navigate. # Once the parkway migrates into North Carolina, prehistoric-size rhododendron dominate the roadside. For those cold-weather Midwesterners whose only experience with rhododendron are in bushy clumps in a garden, the sight of 20-foot trees is vaguely frightening -- a Dr. Seuss image softened by the shower of blossoms in June and July. Wild-flower aficionados can find schedules of blooms all along the parkway from March through October. # Starting north with mile post 0 in Rockfish Gap, Va., the parkway is marked along the way until it ends in Cherokee, N.C., at mile post 469. # All along the Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never would have visited if not for the closures and detours. # Unexpected stops allow that great traveler 's companion, serendipity, to make an appearance. It was 9 p.m. when we were strolling through the literary town of Blowing Rock to find the streets and stores entirely deserted, except for a jam-packed English pub celebrating St. Patrick 's Day. # This peaceful mountain town has attracted authors for decades. Margaret( Gone With the Wind) Mitchell and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who wrote The Yearling here, sought respite in Blowing Rock. # We climbed the mile-high swinging bridge at Grandfather Mountain and cast for trout in Lake Lure at the base of Chimney Rock. # We ended our Blue Ridge Parkway drive in Asheville, where you 'll find the Blue Ridge Folk Art Center at mile post 382. It offers broad selections of the works of local artists and craftsmen. Two miles away, the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center has a bounty of information on the history and sites along the way. # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacationers.
