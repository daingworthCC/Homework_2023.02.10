3055041 <p> Awash this summer in $ 14 oil, Oryx Energy did n't have the cash to keep its drilling programs going. <p> For every barrel of oil it was producing, Oryx was receiving $ 5 less than it had been counting on. <p> Facing tough choices, the company decided to sacrifice some of its onshore exploration and production operations so it could continue to invest in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Such projects hold out a big payoff, but carry more risk than onshore development. <p> In late July, the Dallas independent put $ 35 million worth of onshore properties up for sale, cut payroll expenses by 20 percent and began seeking partners for some projects, particularly onshore. <p> " I 've got 65 percent to 70 percent of my exploration, and probably that much of my development, focused in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, " said Robert Keiser, Oryx 's chief executive officer. The company already was moving in that direction, he said. " Price was just a hell of a motivator. " <p> Many energy companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects, cutting expenses and, in some cases, laying off workers. <p> Analysts are now predicting a sustained period of low oil prices. Some expect oil to go no higher than $ 16 per barrel by the end of this year and then stay in a range of $ 13 to $ 17 per barrel over the next two years. <p> " There 's a fundamental shift, " says Nizam Sharief, director of energy research at Houston energy consulting firm Hornsby &; Co. " The technological changes brought about have lowered the cost of finding and producing oil. Cutting back production is a temporary solution. Long-term, it will drift right back to the cost of producing oil. " <p> Prices are a far cry from 1996, when they averaged $ 22.09 per barrel for the U.S. benchmark, West Texas intermediate. <p> Oil demand was strong then, particularly from the Far East. Supplies were limited as Saudi Arabia reined in production and Iraq was no longer exporting oil in the aftermath of the Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances in such areas as three-dimensional seismic exploration made it much easier for oil companies to pinpoint underground reservoirs of oil and gas. The combination of higher oil prices and lower development costs boosted industry profits. <p> That situation abruptly changed at the end of 1997. Iraqi oil began to come on the market in limited quantities. The Saudis, frustrated that other OPEC members, including Venezuela and Nigeria, were producing oil in excess of their allowable limits, supported an increase in OPEC 's production ceiling. <p> That move was ill-timed. It brought a gush of new oil onto the market just as Asia shook under a financial crisis that wiped out oil demand. Domestically, a warmer-than-usual winter sapped demand for heating oil. <p> Efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC nations in March and again in June to cut production and prop up oil prices, came as too little, too late. <p> And the worst may not be over. <p> Asia 's crisis could become more severe, said Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant presence in Asia. He believes that if the yen continues to weaken, Japan could face its worst recession in 23 years. <p> " There 's a lot of clouds on the horizon, " said Gary Ross, chief executive officer at PIRA Energy Group, a New York-based oil and gas consulting firm. " There 's a lot of uncertainty. It makes it difficult to be overly enthusiastic about price expectations. " <p> Ken Miller, a senior principal in the Houston office of Purvin &; Gertz, an international energy consulting firm, recently reduced his oil price forecast for 1999 to an average of $ 15 per barrel. And he does n't expect prices to rebound significantly for the next two to three years until Asia comes out of its slump. <p> " People start thinking about the ' 80s, " said Susan Cunningham, vice president of Exploration at Statoil Exploration( US). <p> The industry is especially nervous because the downturn in oil prices has lasted far longer and brought prices far lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $ 22, oil companies routinely talked about setting their budget assumptions at $ 16 to $ 17, said Bill Gilmer, senior economist with the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. <p> " Now we 're at $ 13 or $ 14, and I 'm sure there are a lot of people... that do n't feel as good, " he said. <p> Some observers predict that if low prices persist, oil companies desperate for cash will unload properties on the market. <p> " I can assure you that if this damn thing lasts for another six months there will be blood everywhere, " said Jefferey Clarke, chairman of Coho Energy, a Dallas independent. <p> Low prices will make it harder for independent oil and gas companies to raise cash from the public markets. <p> " Most of the independents have debt ratios over 50 percent, so they are highly leveraged, " said Van Levy, energy analyst with Jefferies &; Co. in Houston. " The debt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A growing number of independent oil and gas companies such as Oryx, Mitchell Energy &; Development Corp. and Union Pacific Resources Group have cut their capital spending budgets because they ca n't operate profitably otherwise. <p> The oil-service industry already has cut personnel as operations have slowed and may lay off more people before the year is out, Gilmer said. <p> Companies have been reluctant to lay off employees so soon after hi-ring them during last year 's work force and equipment shortage, Gilmer said. But he compared today 's industry environment to the 1991-92 period, when gas prices collapsed, the rig count slumped and the industry lost 7,000 jobs. <p> " It can happen again, " he said. " I do n't have any doubt about it, and I think it will happen again. " <p> Carol Freedenthal, principal with Jofree Corp., an energy consulting firm, estimates that for the industry to begin growing again, oil prices need to be about $ 17 to $ 19 per barrel and natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubic feet. <p> So far, oil-field service companies have felt the initial brunt of the downturn. <p> Rig rental rates, which have gone nowhere but up the last several years, have begun retreating. About 60 new supply boats will be added to the fleet of vessels serving the offshore industry in the Gulf between now and 2000, and many of those will sit idle at the docks in the near term, said Dan Pickering, head of equity research at Houston-based Simmons &; Company International. <p> " Every drilling company and every service company has been letting people go, " said Allen Brooks, oil-field services analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. " If there 's one thing about this period of entrenchment, they 're much quicker to cut people when the hardware stops than they used to be. " <p> Companies that have announced layoffs this year include Schlumberger, which will only confirm it has fired " several hundred " workers ; EVI Weatherford, which has shed 1,300 jobs ; Lone Star Technologies, an oil-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Daniel Industries, a Houston equipment maker, which has cut an unconfirmed number of workers. <p> While many service companies reported healthy earnings in the second quarter, they cautioned that the market should be prepared for a downturn in the third quarter. <p> Input/Output, which makes and sells seismic data acquisition equipment, recently warned its investors that decreased exploration spending by oil and gas companies, caused by low oil prices, had reduced demand for the company 's equipment. Earnings for the quarter ended in August, the company said, would be " substantially " below market expectations. <p> " If there 's been any surprise, it 's how quickly things have changed, " said Brooks, referring to the rapid pace at which the industry has gone from an equipment shortage to excess rigs and supply boats. <p> Many observers believe the deepwater Gulf of Mexico will emerge relatively unscathed from the recent oil price plunge. While projects there are expensive and risky, they take as long as a decade to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the most recent lease sale in the western Gulf in August, oil companies paid sharply higher prices for key properties, although the overall number of winning bids was down. <p> Worldwide, however, as many as five deepwater rigs could stand idle by the fourth quarter in the Southeast Asian market, and four may cease drilling the North Sea, according to a report by Hanifen Imhoff, a Denver-based investment research firm. <p> For much of the year, natural gas prices have provided a strong counterpoint to oil, prompting companies to shift their exploration dollars. <p> Abraxas Petroleum Corp. has postponed drilling on about 100 locations in West Texas where reserves are mainly oil, with the exception of wells required to be drilled in order for the company to maintain its leasehold position, said Jack Roney, vice president for corporate development at the San Antonio-based company. <p> " We 'd have to have realized prices of $ 16 or better to begin development again on these fields, " Roney said. The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects in South Texas, Wyoming and Canada. <p> Natural gas prices are expected to soften between now and 2005 due to increased Canadian imports and increasing production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, according to market projections of the Gas Research Institute in Washington. <p> The institute is predicting gas prices will remain at $ 2 to $ 2.25 per thousand cubic feet through 2005. <p> Some energy companies see the low oil price environment as a buying opportunity as the values of reserves decline and cheap oil comes onto the market. <p> Coho Energy, for example, with 70 percent of its reserves in oil, sold a majority stake of about 41 million shares to the buyout firm of Hicks, Muse, Tate &; Furst to raise $ 250 million specifically for acquisitions. <p> " We see this as a buying opportunity, " said Clarke of Coho Energy.
