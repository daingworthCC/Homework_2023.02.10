4187141 <h> RICHMOND <p> Citing concerns about alcohol abuse on college campuses, Gov. Terry McAuliffe has vetoed Del. Barry Knight 's legislation that would have allowed state liquor stores to sell a more potent version of grain alcohol. <p> Knight 's bill, HB143, would have increased from 101 to 151 the proof of neutral grain alcohol -- described as " without distinctive character, aroma, taste or color " -- that could be sold in state stores. <p> The legislation was intended to allow state stores to sell Everclear, a grain alcohol manufactured by St. Louis-based Luxco. <p> The bill cleared both chambers by large margins, but when it went to McAuliffe 's desk, a college alcohol abuse prevention group urged him to veto it. <p> McAuliffe first tried to amend the bill by delaying its implementation for a year while the state Commission on Youth studied its potential impact on public safety and health. But at the urging of Knight, R-Virginia Beach, the Republican-controlled House defeated the Democratic governor 's amendment. <p> McAuliffe then vetoed the measure. In a statement, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these products is young people who are attracted to their high proof and low cost. Underage drinking and binge drinking, particularly on college campuses, are threats to public health and safety that we should be working to curb. " <p> Because the House already has voted down McAuliffe 's attempt to amend the measure, it ca n't by law vote against him again on the measure. So the veto will stand, and the higher-proof alcohol will remain banned from state stores. <p> In his two years in office, McAuliffe has a perfect record : None of his vetoes has been overridden.
