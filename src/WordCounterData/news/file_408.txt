3068841 <p> Show Jeffco the money If you want to dance, you have to pay the piper. <p> But a lot of Jefferson County school kids wo n't be doing much dancing in the years to come if recent trends continue. <p> Sixteen years have passed since county voters approved a mill levy for their schools - and over the course of those 16 years, the district 's student enrollment has increased from 75,650 to 88,793. Also since 1983, the county 's population has increased from 391,600 to 501,591, and its registered voters more than doubled, from 158,290 to 335,227. <p> But despite the school district 's growth, those same voters rejected a mill-levy increase for their schools just last year. Facing a budgetary nightmare, the district recently beseeched its teachers to tread gently in their request for raises. <p> In an amazing show of cooperation, the teachers accepted a 2 percent salary increase, deferring their automatic annual raises for experience and additional education. Those increases would be given next January and March only if money becomes available. <p> Whether that money will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, though, the district is proposing a $ 455 million budget for 1999-2000, with nearly $ 2 million in cuts. Those include $ 700,000 slashed from instructional services, including fewer materials for schools and less professional development for teachers. The district also will reduce bus transportation to save $ 225,000, and it will eliminate eight to 10 custodians to save $ 500,000. <p> The cuts would have been even more drastic, but parents asked that the district increase fees rather than eliminate popular programs. So athletic fees are going up from $ 75 to $ 100 per sport, to raise $ 300,000. In addition, outside organizations will pay more to use school buildings, generating $ 250,000, and staff members will pay a fee to gain access to the Internet from their home computers, producing another $ 250,000. <p> For tight-fisted voters, these may seem to be innocuous trims. For the student slogging through the snow to school, and for the teacher wiping up the chemistry lab spill herself because a custodian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome. <p> The $ 25 increase in sport fees could determine whether some students can afford to participate in more than one sport. And teachers doing research at home for classroom presentation are likely to feel disappointed at having to pay a fee to access the Internet when they already are accepting reduced raises. <p> When one adds up all the nips and tucks that have been under way at Jefferson County Schools for more than 1 1/2 decades, it comes down to major surgery. <p> Ultimately, this district is going to need a major infusion of cash if it is to keep pace with its growth. -- -- -- <p> Competition in the skies <p> Airline competition is one of those concepts that seems to be honored more in theory than in practice. At major airports all across the country, a single pattern has been established. One airline dominates traffic while the others scramble for the crumbs. <p> Except for a great deal of hand-wringing, the U.S. Justice Department until recently has done very little to alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month brought an anti-trust action against American Airlines, contending that it has used illegal tactics to compete with Vanguard, a low-cost airline at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. It specifically charged that American had adjusted capacity and used below-cost fares against Vanguard on a number of routes, especially Dallas-Cincinnati and Dallas-Phoenix and Dallas-Wichita. <p> The competitive tactics worked in some cases and forced Vanguard to abandon service. In a couple of cities, American actually instituted service after Vanguard began offering flights. <p> The filing of the Justice Department case raises the question of whether it might also go after United Airlines, which was accused a couple of years ago of anti-competitive tactics by Frontier Airlines. United dominates traffic at Denver International Airport, competing with Frontier on a number of routes. <p> From what is known, a suit against United seems unlikely at this time. For one thing United is n't relying on below-cost pricing to the degree that it once did, nor has it greatly increased capacity on its competing routes. It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its stock has quadrupled in the last year. <p> Frontier had complained of other allegedly anti-competitive practices involving commissions and bonuses to travel agents and United 's lack of cooperation in transferring frequent flier bonuses, but those issues are not central to the American case. <p> It 's always possible that future anti-trust cases will be brought that would directly affect DIA, but even if they do n't materialize it 's possible that some general good will come of the American case. It is the first major anti-trust action since airline deregulation and it does put all airlines on notice that someone is watching. <p> If a major airline is employing anti-competitive practices, the executives now know that they could be the next federal anti-trust target. That does n't necessarily mean that the dominant carriers will lower prices or directly benefit consumers in some other way, but it probably wo n't do any harm either. -- -- -- <p> Sanctuary for solitude Ironically, a former nuclear bomb factory offers Colorado an irreplaceable opportunity to preserve open space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Energy and the Fish and Wildlife Service designated 800 acres at Rocky Flats for a wildlife preserve. <p> While welcomed, the move left unresolved what to do with the remaining federal property. Colorado should seize the chance to create one of its finest open-space preserves. <p> In all, DOE controlled 6,500 acres at Rocky Flats, located between Golden and Boulder just east of the foothills. Only 384 acres were used to make atom bomb triggers, and those are being cleaned up to permit future office or light-industrial use. Another 300 acres were ceded to the National Energy Research Laboratory for an electricity-generating " wind farm. " <p> Those moves left 5,800 acres for other uses. Of that land, the feds now say 800 acres will become a wildlife preserve. The Fish and Wildlife Service should open that property for public enjoyment, such as day hiking or bird-watching. <p> But communities near Rocky Flats must decide how to use the remaining 5,000 acres. <p> At one time, Arvada and Jefferson County had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another office and industrial development. However, that pact apparently expired months ago. <p> Renewing the deal makes no sense, because the push would only add to urban sprawl. There are other places that factories and offices can locate in metro Denver. But there are n't many places left along the Front Range where natural habitats thrive largely undisturbed. Paradoxically, the vast buffer area around Rocky Flat 's industrial core harbors some of the most pristine tracts remaining in the burgeoning north metro area. To put the opportunity into perspective, the 5,000 acres of potential open space at Rocky Flats is bigger than the old Stapleton Airport 's 4,700 acres. <p> Already, an advisory board representing seven communities near Rocky Flats has recommended that the buffer area be saved as open space. Colorado state agencies and its congressional delegation should support that idea. <p> The Rocky Flats buffer area - with its unspoiled tall-grass prairies and riverside ecosystems - represents a chance to create about 10 square miles for hiking, biking, horseback riding, camping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once manufactured weapons of mass destruction could be transformed into a sanctuary for solitude, just minutes from the city 's heart.
