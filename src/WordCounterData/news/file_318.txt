3054441 <p> Two boys in school uniforms sit in front of computers, engrossed in the scenes before them. <p> No grunts, whoops or karate-chop sounds emanate from the screens. No blood splatters, no heads roll. What 's grabbed the boys ' attention is not Doom or MechWarrior or HyperBlade, or any of the other exceedingly violent computer games dear to the hearts of many young cybersurfers these days. <p> " " Hey, check this out, I 've got to make a decision, " says Samuel Johnson, 13, to his friend and fellow Gregory Lincoln Middle School student Brandon Williams, also 13. <p> The scene on his screen depicts a typical classroom. Suddenly one of the students is tempted to cheat on a test. What should he do? <p> The young man pauses a moment, then clicks on " " no. " <p> But he 's not out of the woods yet. The game takes him through an entire day, during which he confronts an increasingly serious set of dilemmas, the kind commonly faced by kids growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name. Should he react in anger or walk away to cool off? Should he skip out or stay in school? Paint graffiti or put the marker down? At the mall, a friend considers stealing a CD from a music store. How should he react? Someone offers him a marijuana cigarette. Take it or decline? <p> Samuel has already played the game a couple of times. He 's getting the hang of it. In each case, he takes the high road - cooling off, staying in school, walking away from the friend, refusing the joint. <p> " " I 'm seeing that if I make one decision, it carries out to another, " he says. <p> Bingo. <p> That 's the message that makers of Beat the Street!, an interactive CD computer game, hope youngsters will take away from their new software, which aims to teach kids ages 7-14 about conflict prevention. Much curricula has been developed on conflict resolution, they say - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The whole idea is that the decisions you make create consequences, " says game creator Verdene Ryder, a national textbook author who taught at Bellaire High School for 22 years. " " It allows youngsters to go back and re-think their actions. " <p> Players of Beat the Street! discover their choices do indeed hold consequences. Depending on how they select, they could end up in a gang hangout, in the hospital, in front of a judge, even in jail. Too many bad decisions and they 're out of the game - the street beats them. <p> " " In my research, I kept hearing kids say, ' It just happened ' or ' It was n't my fault, ' " Ryder says. " " I wanted to help children understand they have direction in their own lives. <p> The world does n't just happen to you. " <p> So she teamed up with Carolyn Peterson, who owns a local marketing and multimedia development firm, and a creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was Beat the Street!, which was recently demonstrated in Peterson 's office by three students who attend Gregory Lincoln. <p> The goal was to see how well the game would hold the students ' attention. After an hour, they were still playing hard. The three had to be nearly hog-tied back into the van to return to school. <p> This was good news to Gail H.Revis, director of Minority Male Initiative, a Houston Independent School District program that goes into 42 schools to target special needs of minority males. She thought Beat the Street! might be a valuable addition to a school 's social-skills or character-development curriculum, be it in the inner-city or suburbia. <p> " " I get a lot of material across my desk, " she said, watching the boys play. " " This one stood out because it lets a student try something and get feedback. They get to experience what it 's like to skip school, then find out what happens. They can call someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then find out it 's not the thing to do. When they leave( the game), they 're in no more trouble than when they sat down. " <p> She says the format suits those raised in the Sesame Street, MTV, computer-crazy generation. Too many programs, she says, rely on a teacher dispensing the information, which means students are forced into a passive, listening role. <p> While HISD does not formally endorse the product, she says, individual schools can choose to buy it. It 's available through educational catalogs and also through Carest Associates, the marketing company. To fit into a school setting, the game includes questions about English and math. <p> But it can also be played at home, says Peterson. The game comes with a guidebook that helps adults start a dialogue with kids about the lessons they 've learned in Beat the Street! <p> The game contains more than 100 scenarios. Software is tailored to both girls and boys, depending on how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Efrain Chavez, 13, has learned the hard way which choice to click on : He 's already landed in the hospital once. But the message is getting through. <p> " " It 's good to hang around good people, " he says. " " You hang around bad people, you end up getting in trouble. " " " I beat the street! " Johnson says from across the table. <p> Nobody ever really " " loses " at Beat the Street!, says Peterson, but an evaluation sheet printed at game 's end charts a player 's decisions. The sheet enables parents or teachers to examine a child 's responses " " without having to look over their shoulder, " she says. <p> Middle school is an especially appropriate time for a game like this, says Ryder, given the vulnerability of youths at that age. Confronted with a new level of autonomy, they make decisions that can impact the rest of their lives, she says. <p> Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developer, wrote most of the script for the game. He says he struggled to find the right epithets to use in parts that address name-calling. He finally settled on words like jerk and witch. <p> " " I knew it might not be what kids are really hearing, " he says, smiling sheepishly, " " but we had to tone it down some so the game could go into the schools. " <p> Name-calling may seem mild in view of guns, gang fights and drive-by shootings, but the seeds of conflict and violence are sown early, says Revis. If you can nip it in the bud, all the better, Who are bullies, she asks, but gang leaders in training? <p> " " We have kids killing each other these days over name-calling, " she says. <p> Studies show the U.S homicide rate for males ages 15-24 is 22 per 10,000 - the highest rate in the industrialized world. <p> About half of all homicides start as arguments between two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't solve the tangled social problems that lie behind this country 's high violence rate, says Revis. But it does give kids a way to practice making wise choices in a safe setting. <p> " " It 's OK to make a low score in this game, but not in real life, " she says. <p> Beat the Street! costs $ 42.90 plus $ 5 for shipping and handling and can be ordered by calling 800-846-1576. The game has its own Web site on the Internet : www.echelon1. <p> com/BTS!
