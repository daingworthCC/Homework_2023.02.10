3035341 <p> Do n't ask Gloria and Dan Bohan to find you a cheap airline ticket for your next vacation. They 're not looking for that business anymore. <p> These are transitional times at the Fairfax-based Omega World Travel Inc., one of the country 's largest travel agencies with about $ 500 million in revenue last year and 200 offices. In the new world of travel, a business that has always had low a turn in the road, " said Gloria Bohan, 56, president and chief executive of the company she founded in Fredericksburg, Va., in 1972. " We want to find ways to survive in an industry that 's changing. " <p> This turn is at the junction of several trends. Airlines last year cut commissions to travel agencies from 10 percent of the ticket price to 8 percent. More travel services are being offered on the Internet. And agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to find and keep employees at salaries they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> So the Bohans are looking for ways to save -- and make -- more money. They 're concentrating on more profitable operations : cruises, travel packages and adventure vacations. They 're closing some of their full-service Omega outlets around the country and are funneling corporate accounts to a new reservation center in North Carolina. They 're training female prisoners to become reservation takers. They 're no longer catering to tourists just wanting to book Super Saver tickets. <p> There is still a good profit to be had in cruises and vacation packages, so Omega is hot on those. But the vacationer scouting out good air fares, once a mainstay of the industry, is no longer welcomed with open arms. Omega now charges a $ 15 fee for writing airline ticket transactions of less than $ 400. More than two-thirds of travel agencies planned to charge similar fees after last year 's commission cuts, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. <p> " We prefer that people who want really low-priced tickets go directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, " said Dan Bohan, 58, chief operating officer and 45 percent owner of Omega. " That did n't used to be the case. " <p> Omega ranks among the top 20 privately owned Washington-based companies and is one of the largest owned by a woman( Gloria Bohan owns 55 percent of the company). Omega ranked No. 9 in the nation in travel agency revenue, according to Business Travel News. <p> But revenue does n't necessarily mean profit. Because so much of its revenue simply goes through its hands straight from traveler to airline or tour operator, Omega 's profit is only about 0.25 percent of revenue, Dan Bohan said. While Omega has consistently made between $ 1 million and $ 2 million a year, the company will lose money for the first time in a decade in 1998 if it ca n't renegotiate some multiyear contracts signed before the airline commission cuts. <p> Eighty percent of Omega 's business is corporate and government contracts, but that is n't necessarily good news this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has three years left, " is our biggest problem. " That contract requires Omega to pay the government 2.6 percent of the price of all tickets it writes, with the agency 's profit coming from the remainder of the airline commission, now reduced to 8 percent. <p> The airline commission cuts reduced Omega 's average commission from $ 40 to $ 32 per ticket. Writing a ticket can cost the agency from $ 25 to $ 50 in agents ' time depending on the complexity of the travel. <p> To compensate for the decline in revenue from airlines, the Bohans are consolidating, centralizing -- and exploring the Internet. <p> Several years ago, the agency started closing two or three full-service storefront offices a year in this area. Additionally, it is staffing the remaining offices with fewer agents -- down in some cases from five a few years ago to just one today. It used to have four walk-in agency offices in the District and now has one. It has 16 suburban Washington offices but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company has no specific timetable for closing them. The Bohans wo n't go below that " because it 's a personal business, " and they need to maintain a personal presence, explained Gloria Bohan. <p> " This is a trend. You will see less and less storefront stores unless they are selling cruises and tours, " said Dan Bohan, predicting that about half the travel agency offices in the District will close by next year. <p> They are directing as much as possible of their corporate and government traffic to their Jacksonville, N.C., central reservation office, which opened last year. An agent in downtown Washington with two years of experience makes about $ 30,000 a year at Omega ; a North Carolina reservationist earns about $ 15,000. <p> " The attitude of the people in North Carolina tends to be better than that of the people here, " Dan Bohan said. His wife said the North Carolina agents tend to go at a more " accommodating " pace than Washingtonians, possibly because the pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient. But about 300 of its 700 employees are still in the Washington area. <p> Omega also is cultivating help in an even more unconventional spot -- women 's prisons. After training prisoners for six months last year, Omega in January started running a reservation center out of the Leath Correctional Facility in Greenwood, S.C. Thirteen women at the state prison handle reservations but do not take credit card numbers, transferring calls to an Omega supervisor when it 's time for the customer to pay. <p> At this point, the center is used mainly by three airline ticket consolidators, who sell bargain-rate tickets but who do not want their use of the prison operation known, Dan Bohan said. The consolidators pay Omega $ 3 an hour for each reservationist who answers at a toll-free number, and Omega pays the prison $ 3 an hour. Each woman keeps 50 cents an hour, and the prison gets $ 2.50. During this start-up phase Omega loses money but it hopes to make a profit eventually by charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system benefits everyone. The women get trained for jobs after they leave prison, and travel companies get cheap help. They hope to open 10 of these centers in prisons around the country. <p> " You will not know you 're talking to a prisoner, " Dan Bohan said. <p> The Bohans dismiss any nervousness that people might have about booking with prisoners, pointing to security measures such as on-site supervisors, weekly body searches and blocks on computers to keep prisoners from seeing credit card numbers. But they acknowledge that they have had trouble selling corporate clients on using the prison center, even when it would have reduced a company 's travel costs. <p> Keeping ahead in the industry also means harnessing the power of the Internet, the Bohans said. Omega started a Web site to sell cruises( www.cruise.com) last year. It plans to invest $ 1 million this year in promoting the site along with several others that it operates. <p> " We need to position ourselves now. There is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloria Bohan. More people will use the Internet to get information, though people will remain reluctant to book themselves online, creating more customers for agencies like theirs, the Bohans predicted. <p> " There are two things that are changing dramatically in our business, " Dan Bohan concluded. " The need to build call centers in other areas and the need to incorporate new technology.... Not everyone is going to survive. "
