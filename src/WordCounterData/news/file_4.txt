3000841 <p> There was no way out this time, so Brett Favre waited as gravity and two Washington Redskins linebackers conspired against him. <p> LaVar Arrington got to him first, Jeremiah Trotter a split second after, and the forces of man and nature pushed Favre 's left knee out from under him, twisted and exposed, helpless in a way that has ended so many football careers. <p> Favre, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, hobbled to his feet, teary-eyed according to some, and was soon scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging exam that could have revealed any number of injuries. The film showed a slightly sprained lateral collateral ligament, an injury he could continue to play on. Then, it showed something else : tendons and cartilage as strong and as thick as telephone cables. <p> " The doctors were amazed, " Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman said Friday. " The ligaments were that of a 22-year-old swimmer. " <p> It could be called luck if Favre, 33, had n't cheated the fates so many times during his 12-year career -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive his streak of 165 starts at a position that may be the most hazardous in sports.( The former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski is second on the list with 116.) Favre has been sacked 337 times for 2,190 yards and has withstood the punishment time after time. <p> In an era when so many of his peers have been knocked out of the game -- Steve Young and Troy Aikman, in particular -- Favre has continued to thrive in the face of linemen who grow bigger every year. <p> " There have been times when injuries could have kept me out, and there have been times when injuries should have kept me out, " said Favre, who was born in Gulfport, Miss. " But as my mom always said, I 'm hardheaded. " <p> The only N.F.L. player to win three Most Valuable Player awards, Favre is poised to wrap his hands around a fourth. The Packers are 7-1 as they prepare to play host to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, consecutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of his sport. <p> " It 's almost come to be expected, " Sherman said. " You just do n't expect him to miss time because he expects so much from himself. I actually think he wills himself to heal faster than the other guy because he wants to play so badly. And it has nothing to do with consecutive games or any records. What is important to him is that his teammates respect him. " <p> Favre said : " The last thing you want to do is keep starting and look bad. Nowadays, guys sit out all the time. It 's almost like they have the upper hand. But how can you stand to be on the sideline or in the locker room when you can be out there really contributing? " <p> Favre will wear a brace on his left knee for a few more weeks, he will not need surgery. The Packers had a bye after the Redskins game, but Favre insisted he would have been able to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? His body remains sturdy at an age when many other athletes are breaking down. And considering his early years in the league, that is somewhat of an anomaly. <p> Favre once played the role of good-time Charlie to the hilt. He drank. He was hospitalized in 1996 for an addiction to the painkiller Vicodin. He sometimes arrived at practice with his hair a disheveled reminder of the night 's activity. It was the stuff of burnout, of Mickey Mantle looking back and wishing he had treated his body better. <p> Had he continued down that path, Favre said, " There is no question that, if I was sitting here, it would be in a different role, or not as good, or not here. <p> " Or not living. " <p> Favre, following terms of his drug rehabilitation, agreed not to drink alcohol for two years. He switched to taking non-narcotic and nonsteroidal drugs. He also married in 1996 and has two daughters with his wife, Deanna. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Sherman said. " I think he was at a crossroads in his life, and he sat down and decided what was important to him and went that way. And it did n't include some of the things that were pulling him down from that side of the fence. " <p> Since joining the team in a trade in 1992, Favre 's constancy with the Packers is one of the few stable things in the constantly changing league. His primary receiver has changed from Sterling Sharpe to Antonio Freeman to Bill Schroeder to Donald Driver. Sherman is his third coach, after Mike Holmgren and Ray Rhodes( though, as Sherman pointed out, the offense Favre has run is virtually unchanged.) <p> The league has expanded, teams have moved to new cities, and divisions have been realigned, but Favre continues to sink his roots deeper into the town that lives for green-and-yellow Sundays. <p> Favre said his body would give out before his arm ever did, though neither one seems close to expiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still otherworldly. <p> " We always kid him about coming off the mound, so to speak, when he throws, like a pitcher does, " Doug Pederson, Favre 's backup, said. " When he does that, somebody 's chest is going to get caved in. To still have the same arm strength, having gone through some arm problems, wrist problems, thumb problems, is phenomenal. " <p> Safety Darren Sharper put it this way : " He 's got that country-boy strength. Just real tough. " <p> Some of Favre 's strength is in his genes. At 6 feet 2 inches, 225 pounds, he is hardly small. But Favre is also not a weight-lifting fiend. A lot of what manifests itself as physical strength is mental. <p> " The part that is amazing to me, " Tennessee Titans General Manager Floyd Reese said Friday, " is not just him playing injured or playing with pain but playing as well as normal when he 's hurt. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball is in your hands for that 10 seconds and you 're running around or dropping back to pass. After the play or after the game the pain will come back, but they can wipe out the pain while they play. " <p> Sherman agreed. <p> " I think the great players like Brett, all of their energy is in focusing, " Sherman said. " They have nothing left that is going to distinguish pleasure and pain. That 's what separates him from everybody else. When he plays golf, he can tell you every score, every hole, everything that happened on that golf course. On a football field, he comes to the sideline and he can tell you exactly where everybody was on every play. He has tremendous recall, and that 's due to his ability to super-focus on the game. " <p> Sherman also said that the view of Favre as a bumpkin could n't be more off. Sure, Favre dashed off after Friday 's practice so he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pederson. And, yes, Favre keeps boots and a camouflage suit in the back of his truck. But only a privileged few see Favre decoding the daily crossword puzzle or reading a book at his locker. <p> " He does n't want anybody to know, " Sherman said. <p> Favre seems comfortable with the idea of one day fading from the spotlight. Retirement can stop Favre 's starting streak, and he has said that he is entertaining the thought. While he has n't picked a year to retire, many people, including Sherman, believe that Favre can play into his 40 's. He has indicated that he wo n't. <p> He can see a quieter, simpler life, free from being a Sunday fixture, from being the guy who always punches the clock and gets up from the devastating tackle. <p> " I will miss the game, " Favre said. " If you retire at the top of the game, maybe it 's because you 're tired of the game. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go through this every day. That part of it, I do n't think I will miss. There may be times when I go, ' Maybe I made a mistake, ' but most of the time it will be : ' I 'm glad I do n't have to worry about that today. I 'm glad I do n't have to be Brett Favre this week.
