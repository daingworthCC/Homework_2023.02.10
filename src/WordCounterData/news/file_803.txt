5018741 <h> Talking to Sarah Bockel about push-pull of the ' Beautiful ' Broadway tour <p> Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune <p> Sarah Bockel is a Chicago actress currently starring as Carole King in the national tour of " Beautiful. " <p> Sarah Bockel is a Chicago actress currently starring as Carole King in the national tour of " Beautiful. "( Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) <p> Morgan GreeneChicago Tribune <p> Near the end of " Beautiful -- The Carole King Musical, " after the audience has watched Carole King fall in and out of love, make hits from the sidelines and finally step into a spotlight all her own, Sarah Bockel, as King, walks out from the wings and looks into the crowd. She takes it all in. The Cadillac Palace Theatre stands in for 1971 Carnegie Hall and the audience serves as those who witnessed King 's first, historic concert performance. Bockel pauses, lambent eyes and splayed smile, and seems to ask : How did I get here? <p> It 's a fitting moment for a former Chicago actress, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down nightly at a piano, center stage, and piping out King 's beloved songs to thousands of fans. <p> " I always had this idea that I really wanted to make my money from acting, " Bockel says on a nippy afternoon at the cozy, sweet-smelling Baker Miller in Lincoln Square, just a few blocks from her old apartment. " I tried to make it. " <p> Bockel, a Palos Park native with a doctor father and homemaker mom, wears a red, white and blue plaid shirt and jeans, with loosely-curled hair half the volume of the King wigs she wears in the show. She orders avocado toast. Like two other Chicago-raised actresses, Jessie Mueller, who won the 2014 Tony Award for best actress in a musical for her performance, and her sister Abby, who took over the role on tour, appearing in its Chicago premiere in 2015, Bockel 's break has much to do with Carole King -- and Chicago. <p> Growing up, Bockel was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater director Ross Pribyl -- a Jesuit priest who spoke of Shakespeare and what it was like to wait in line to see " Rent " on Broadway in the ' 90s -- with her acting training. <p> Asked if she 's seen the movie " Lady Bird, " Bockel raises her eyebrows. The Oscar contender is about a knotty mother-daughter relationship, in which the daughter attends a Catholic school where a theater director decides to stage Stephen Sondheim 's " Merrily We Roll Along, " a Broadway dud, cult favorite and an ambitious selection for drama club. <p> Her school was just like " Lady Bird, " she says. " We were sooo artistic. " <p> Like the daughter Lady Bird, Bockel thought she wanted to attend a liberal arts school far from her hometown, but her affinity for the storefront scene caught up with her. She grew up going to House Theatre shows. " I had the biggest crush on Nathan Allen, " she says, about the company 's founder and artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and after summer stock work that included a stint playing a 21-year-old Dolly Levi, she graduated and came back to Chicago, appearing in shows by the now defunct Ruckus Theatre and Bailiwick, as well as BoHo Theatre, Haven Theatre, Paramount Theatre and Music Theatre Company. One of her favorite gigs was performing in a Christmas show, featuring dolphins, at the Shedd Aquarium. During the day she waited tables, worked at a gym. <p> In 2014, Bockel played Cinderella and Rapunzel in the Hypocrites ' production of " Into the Woods. " In the Tribune review, critic Chris Jones said Bockel possessed a " beautiful voice and a palpable sadness that makes her an underused talent in this town. " <p> An agent saw that production, signed Bockel, who was still a non-Equity performer, and asked if she would come in the following week to tape for " Beautiful. " That led to a New York audition, where she was greeted by her reader : fellow Chicago actress Jessie Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Into the Woods, " but was cast in " Once " on Broadway, making the " Beautiful " audition the first meeting and a welcoming ice breaker between fellow Chicagoans. <p> Did actually being cast in the show start to seem like a possibility? <p> " Ohhh, I do n't know, " Bockel says in one incredulous sigh. " It just kind of became this, ' Welp, got ta go back and do this again. Gon na go get some pizza, be right back in 36 hours. ' " <p> On the day that Bockel finally got the call about joining the tour, in the ensemble and as Abby Mueller 's understudy, she was working as a personal assistant to a woman in the Gold Coast. She quit that day. Even though the tour would not start for months. <p> Luckily, an understudy gig in " Million Dollar Quartet " at the Apollo followed. <p> As we 're talking, Bockel recognizes an employee, who stops by our table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bockel laughs and promises, " I did n't pay her to say that! " <p> Before joining the tour, Bockel had n't met either of the Mueller sisters but knew of the Muellers in the way everyone in Chicago theater knows of the Muellers. She was nervous to meet Abby, which Bockel now says was silly ; she 's become a friend. As Abby 's understudy, Bockel watched her every night, marveling at her consistency. <p> " She 's never not connected, no matter how she 's feeling, " says Bockel. " You ask her sometimes, ' How do you do it every day, Abby? ' And she 's like, ' I just listen. ' Oh, OK. What? Give me a better answer! " <p> After understudying another Carole, and more than a year on the road, Bockel was ready to come home. " People were kind of like, ' Oh my gosh, you 're back, and, oh, you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tough. There was n't a lot of work to be had for me. " She moved in with old friends in the nearby apartment and became the self-described housewife of the home, an unemployed actor putting together patio furniture. <p> When the call finally came for Bockel to join the tour as King, she said yes. <p> " I could n't turn it down, even if I did n't want to tour anymore. " <p> That time spent waiting in the wings has led to an unmistakable Carole, a mix of wide-eyed susceptibility and quiet confidence, who moves the earth a little bit every time she starts to sing. <p> " Self-effacing, " Bockel says, about the varying Caroles. " Able to laugh at ourselves. None of us takes anybody too seriously. People that are n't overconfident. Everybody 's kind of just a normal person. That 's what it says in the script. Just a normal lady. She 's not some kind of big star. " <p> Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 25 people in a drafty storefront. There 's also that push and pull between ambition and contentment, the comfort of Chicago and the always-calling assumption of success to be found in New York, that makes Chicago actors a perspicacious match for King. <p> After lunch, Bockel stops in a jewelry shop down the block to pick up a last-minute gift for her tour hair dresser. She settles on funky peace-sign earrings ; the eclectic shop is filled with necklaces for every astrological sign, gemstones and geodes. " Natural Woman " vibes. Bockel says she told herself, while she was going through auditions for " Beautiful, " that she would buy a ring from the shop if she were cast. She holds up her hand and points to the turquoise reminder. <p> On the ride back to Bockel 's temporary home near the Cadillac Palace, she points out the old Viaduct Theatre on Western Avenue, now Constellation, as the conversation turns to backyard midnight bonfire performances in Chicago playwrights ' backyards and the storefront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and those tiny stipends that do n't even pay a fraction of the rent. <p> Bockel says she 'd love to be on Broadway. She 'd also be happy to work in the city she still calls home, at the prestigious Chicago theaters where she 's long dreamed of performing, and still has yet to be cast. <p> About her own connection to King 's story, Bockel says, " She kind of let the career go where it went. And that 's how I try to be, as much as my anxiety will let it. See where things happen and where things go. "
