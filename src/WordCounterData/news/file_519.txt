4115641 UNITED NATIONS - The White House on Monday hailed the International Criminal Court 's decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of Moammar Gaddafi as further proof of the Libyan leader 's loss of international legitimacy. But the development also laid bare the often selective nature of America 's quest for international justice. # For more than a decade, the United States has steadfastly refused to join the Hague-based court, citing concerns that it might conduct politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. service members or American allies. At the same time, the United States has backed investigations against its adversaries in Sudan and Libya. # Champions of the court welcomed the Obama administration 's support for an ICC investigation in Libya and lauded the U.S. effort to increase its engagement with the tribunal. But they said Washington 's insistence on placing American nationals outside the reach of the court conflicts with the cardinal principle of impartially applying the law. # " It 's clear that the commitment of Washington in these cases is undermined to some extent by its own refusal to seek accountability for abuses that have been documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home, " said James Goldston, a former ICC trial attorney who is executive director of the Open Society 's Justice Initiative. # The debate unfolded Monday as the court 's judges issued a warrant for the arrest of the Libyan leader, his son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and his top military intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, calling for them to stand trial for crimes against humanity in connection with a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters this year. # The three-judge pretrial chamber ruled that ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had established " reasonable grounds " for charging the three men with the murder and persecution of hundreds of Libyan civilians since the government began suppressing public protests Feb. 15. # White House spokesman Jay Carney joined other coalition partners in welcoming the court 's ruling, calling the ICC warrants more evidence that " Gaddafi has lost his legitimacy. " # He told reporters, " This is another step in holding him accountable. " # Libyan Justice Minister Mohamed Qamudi criticized the issuance of the arrest warrants during a Monday night news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly formed to prosecute people from the Third World. " # There was no sign that Gaddafi 's government was planning to surrender him or his inner circle. The Libyan leader has shown remarkable staying power, surviving an onslaught of NATO airstrikes, one of which resulted in the death of one of his sons. # Still, the ruling adds to the mounting international pressure on Gaddafi to yield power. Scores of Gaddafi 's top advisers and diplomats have defected. Even China and Russia, which hold deep reservations about the international court, backed the ICC prosecution. # " This decision once again highlights the increasing isolation of the Gaddafi regime, " said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. " Gaddafi and his henchmen need to realize that time is rapidly running out for them. " # Monday 's ruling marks only the second time that the ICC has sought the arrest of a sitting head of state. In 2005, the court issued an arrest warrant against Sudanese leader Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who stands accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The court has been unable to arrest Bashir ; in fact, he is currently preparing for a visit to Beijing. # Neither Sudan nor Libya are signatories to the treaty, known as the Rome Statute, that established the ICC. As a result, only the U.N. Security Council has the power to approve a criminal investigation on their territory. # The Feb. 26 adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, which approved the ICC prosecution in Libya, marked the first time that the United States had voted in favor of a measure empowering the ICC. # The United States has long maintained an ambiguous relationship with the court. # In his final days in office, President Bill Clinton signed the treaty establishing the court. But President George W. Bush 's administration formally withdrew the presidential signature, citing concern that the tribunal would be used to conduct politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. service members engaged in overseas operations. # During its first term, the Bush administration actively worked to limit the reach of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Guatemala unless it granted blanket immunity to American personnel. # The Bush administration abstained on a 2005 resolution authorizing the ICC prosecution in Sudan, allowing the case to go forward. But it subsequently worked behind the scenes to support the case, blocking appeals by African states to persuade the Security Council to freeze the ICC prosecution in order to facilitate peace talks between Khartoum and Darfurian rebels. # The Obama administration has stepped up U.S. cooperation with the ICC, sending high-level representatives to annual meetings. But it has limited its support, even in cases that are consistent with U.S. interests. # In February, Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, enthusiastically supported the British and French initiative in the Security Council to open an ICC investigation in Libya. But in an effort to address persistent concerns about U.S. exposure, Rice insisted that the resolution not impose any new legal obligations on the United States and that it provide immunity to U.S. service members engaged in military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libyan leader has sparked a debate among scholars, military officers and government officials over the role of such a politically sensitive prosecution in the midst of an armed conflict. Some officials fear it will complicate efforts to get Gaddafi to step down ; others say the charge will send a powerful message to other dictators not to use lethal force against civilians. # Richard Dicker, an expert on the ICC at Human Rights Watch, said the arrest warrant would send " a jarring message to dictators elsewhere who thought they were beyond the reach of the law. " # The ICC prosecutor charged Gaddafi with having " conceived and implemented " a plan to " suppress any challenge to his absolute authority through killings and other acts of persecution executed by the Libyan Security Forces. " The prosecutor said Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Senussi were his chief enforcers. # On Feb. 20, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi blamed the unrest in Libya on " foreign agents " and threatened civil war " worse than Iraq and worse than in Yugoslavia. " # Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moammar Gaddafi described anti-government protesters as " garbage " and " rats " and threatened to " clean Libya inch by inch, house by house, small street by small street, individual by individual, corner by corner, until the country is clear from all garbage and dirt.
