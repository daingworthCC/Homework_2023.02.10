3048341 <p> Sometimes it seems as though our perennial questions about Thanksgiving turkeys are nearly as old as the holiday itself. <p> Here 's an overview of what cooks -- experienced as well as novice -- usually want to know about preparing for the big meal. <p> BUYING <p> The first question is the most basic : " How big a bird do I need? " <p> A good rule of thumb is to allow one to 1 1/2 pounds of uncooked bird per guest. So if you 're feeding 12 guests, purchase a 12- to 16- pound bird. This will also provide for leftovers. Just a small crowd? You 'll find turkeys under nine pounds. Or you can buy a turkey breast. <p> FRESH OR FROZEN? <p> Whether you get a fresh or frozen turkey will depend on time and storage space. Frozen turkeys( available year-round) will keep in the freezer for several months, but they take time to thaw safely. Fresh turkeys are widely available but should be cooked within a few days of purchase. <p> STORAGE <p> Store a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling any poultry, be sure to wash all cutting boards, preparation surfaces, utensils and especially hands with hot soapy water ; this will prevent contaminating other foods with salmonella bacteria that can cause illness. <p> If you bought a frozen turkey, you have probably begun to thaw it already. But remember : Never thaw a frozen turkey at room temperature, which creates ideal conditions for food poisoning. <p> The best way to thaw the bird is in the refrigerator on a tray, allowing 24 hours for each five pounds ; a 16-pound bird, therefore, will take a little more than three days to defrost. <p> If you 've just bought a frozen bird, use the cold-water method -- in your bathtub or sink -- changing the water every 30 minutes. It 's a lot of work, but you 'll get the job done safely. Figure on 30 minutes per pound of turkey : A 16-pound bird will take eight hours. <p> STUFFING <p> To stuff the turkey, plan on 3/4 to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately, and do not stuff ahead of time, which risks bacterial growth. Do n't pack the stuffing into the cavity too tight. The stuffing will absorb juices from the bird, so it needs room to expand. <p> You can bake stuffing separately in a casserole dish -- many cooks prefer it -- but remember that it will not take as long to cook as the turkey. <p> ROASTING <p> Cooks argue about the best way to roast a turkey : breast up, breast down, covered with foil, wrapped in cheesecloth, slow, fast, sideways, backwards. Here are some basics : <p> * Always truss the turkey -- or at least use a stuffing clamp on the legs and tuck the wing tips under the back( which also keeps them from burning). The confinement makes for a much neater bird -- one that wo n't look as if it 's been flailing around in the oven. <p> * Rub the bird with butter or oil, season it, and cover it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent it from browning too quickly. <p> * Baste the turkey every 20 minutes or so to keep it moist. Even a prebasted turkey needs a bit of basting to bring out the flavor and achieve that highly prized golden and crispy skin. <p> * Cooking times vary depending on the size and shape of each turkey( see accompanying chart), so use a meat thermometer. The turkey is done when the temperature reaches 180 to 185 degrees at the thickest part of the thigh, and 165 degrees in the stuffing. <p> Another way to tell : The legs pull freely from the body and the juices run clear. <p> * Let the turkey rest for about 20 minutes after roasting to allow for easier carving and juicier meat. <p> TURKEY HOTLINES <p> Here 's where to call if you have questions or need advice about preparing a holiday meal : <p> * U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Meat and Poultry Hotline :( 800) 535- 4555. <p> Hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 1 p.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Butterball Turkey Talk Line :( 800) 323-4848. <p> Saturday and Sunday, 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. Today, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tomorrow, 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. Also weekdays through December 21, 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. <p> * Fleischmann 's Yeast Hotline :( 800) 777-4959.
