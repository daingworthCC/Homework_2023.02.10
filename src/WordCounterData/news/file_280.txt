3049141 <p> BALANCING QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF LIFE <p> Editor -- Get a grip, California legislators! Life is dangerous. It ca n't be made completely safe no matter how many silly statutes you enact. Even if you could wrap all of us citizens in cotton batting, and prevent us from doing anything that might be remotely harmful to us, there must be some balance between the quantity of life and its quality. <p> Yes, undercooked food can be deadly. Yes, secondhand smoke is toxic. This does not mean that a total ban on rare steaks or smoking in bars is necessary or appropriate. Let 's face it, high-fat foods( in terms of risk of heart disease, cancer etc.) probably " kill " more Californians each year than all of the e. coli or environmental tobacco smoke combined. That does n't mean that we should outlaw Big Macs. <p> So, since you have this uncontrollable need to meddle, what 's next on your agendas? Maybe we should regulate the smoking habits and diets of pregnant women? How about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are present? Or maybe criminal sanctions for those people too stupid to realize that their eating/drinking/smoking habits are unhealthy? You may save a few lives, or maybe not, but what 's left sure wo n't be worth living. <p> NEIL ANDRUS <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> PHONY FISCAL CONSERVATIVE <p> Editor -- Your coverage of Jane Harman 's entry into the gubernatorial race( February 5) contained a glaring contradiction which is, sadly, all too typical of mainstream media reporting on federal budget issues. <p> The article states that Harman is " a fiscal conservative, who supported welfare reform... " and in the very next paragraph calls her " an avid supporter of defense spending and weapons systems such as the B-2 bomber, earning her endorsements and strong financial support from the defense contractors in her district. " <p> How can you call someone a " fiscal conservative " just because they vote to end aid to the poor, while voting for billions to be wasted on gold-plated military pork like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politicians like Harman merely shift tax dollars from the needy -- who can not buy her votes with " strong financial support " -- to the wealthy few, i.e., the fat-cat arms manufacturers on her home turf. When she votes for corporate welfare reform, starting with eliminating the B-2 program, then you can call her a fiscal conservative. Until then, stop providing cover for those who champion the wealthy at the expense of the poor -- and the taxpayers. <p> BRUCE ALLEN <p> California Peace Action <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> SMOKING PERMITS FOR BARS <p> Editor -- I am not a smoker, and I appreciate not having secondhand smoke forced on me. However, last time I looked tobacco was still a legal product, and in a free country people have a right to a minority opinion, even if it 's suicidal. <p> How about a compromise? Issue " smoking permits " to bars, just like liquor permits. Since on ly 20 percent of Californians smoke, limit permits to 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist destinations. Issue them by lottery. Then let the smokers and non-smokers sort themselves out. <p> It 's a simple concept : free choice. If you do n't like smoke, do n't drink or work in a smoking bar. Simple! People make decisions all the time not to drink or work in certain bars because they are uncomfortable there. <p> If enough people believe in non-smoking and boycott smoking bars, they will fold up. If they continue to prosper, they must have a market. But nobody is forced to inhale or not inhale. <p> SHARI PRANGE <p> Bonny Doon <p>. <p> BAN LIVING IN CARS <p> Editor -- The last thing in the world San Francisco needs is to legalize people living in cars! To sanction this practice is an affront to every city taxpayer. <p> The Police Commission president should consult with the residents of the city before going to Ms. Appel, who 's only answer will be " Yes. " I, for one, do not want to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will create. <p> TED LOEWENBERG <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> NAPA PROJECT OPPOSED <p> Editor -- We, as a native Napan and longtime resident take issue with the article, " Napa -- A Land Divided "( Chronicle, February 10). The vast majority of Napans are united against the proposed Stanly Ranch development. <p> The recent storm which did not flood downtown Napa did flood Stanly Lane, which is located directly within the scope of the proposed building site. Money hungry developers are ignoring all evidence which shows Stanly Ranch, as it exists, is a natural wetland and flood plain. <p> The article states " many old and diseased eucalyptus... will be replaced by native species. " What was n't mentioned is the love Napans have for these trees which, should no development occur, would be fine as they are. <p> The fire station offered by the developers will serve their own needs. Napa has a current emergency situation in its overdevel oped Browns Valley area, which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Napans are not impressed with the suggestion that this development will be a " cash cow " for city coffers. It is common knowledge that developments do not support themselves nor do they feed into city funds. <p> AL VENTIMIGLIA <p> KATHY NOVELLI <p> Napa <p>. <p> MIXING KIDS AND TEENS <p> Editor -- As John Wildermuth observed in his excellent article, " Too Young for Middle School? "( Chronicle, February 10), many parents balk at pushing their sixth-grade children into a new environment full of teenagers trying to act grown-up. <p> But plenty of parents are just as wary about sending seventh- and eighth-graders into the same environment -- even though we realize there are some excellent middle schools in San Francisco and other Bay Area districts. <p> It 's not our daughters ' wearing lipstick and dangling earrings that makes us nervous. In the ' 90s, it 's hardly overprotective to worry about binge drinking, drugs, eating disorders, rape, deadly sexually transmitted diseases, gangs and intensified exposure to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls " junk culture. " <p> And it 's quite rational to question the wisdom of wrenching children out of their familiar elementary schools during the turmoil of early adolescence and tossing them into a big new setting where peer pressure decrees that dangerous behavior is cool and studying is n't. That 's why more and more parents are calling for K-8 schools. <p> CAROLINE GRANNAN <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> NORTON 'S EDICT <p> Editor -- The 1869 " proclamation " purportedly issued by Emperor Norton calling for a bridge from Oakland to the Farallones bypassing San Francisco was a fraud. It was made up by an Oakland newspaper as a way of twitting San Francisco 's best known citizen and the city in general. <p> The real deal was Norton 's edict issued in 1872. It called for, quote : " a suspension bridge... from Oakland point to Goat Island, and thence to Telegraph Hill. " Not exactly the route chosen for the Bay Bridge, but close enough to proclaim it the " Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norton The First, " written by former News Call-Bulletin columnist William Drury. <p> D. McQUEEN <p> Berkeley <p>. <p> DO N'T SPELL'EM OUT <p> Editor -- Please do not listen to Mr. Highton of Reno( Letters, February 11). I find vulgar language very offensive and would not want to read a bunch of disgusting words in the daily newspaper. If I wanted to read bad words I would buy an X-rated book which is far from my intention. Being subjected to filthy language on the bus or street is bad enough. I do n't need to read it in print also. The letter and dashes is bad enough. <p> OLIVETTA CHAVEZ <p> San Francisco
