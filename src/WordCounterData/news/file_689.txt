4190741 <h> Bears tout benefit of joint practices ; Patriots dynasty helps too <h> Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Sports Newsletter <p> One of football 's great aphorisms says the Bears will be happy to hit someone other than their own teammates their week. The reality -- the benefit of practices against another team -- is n't about physicality as much as it is everything else. <p> " You get to see different looks, different players, different pass rush moves, different run schemes, " guard Kyle Long said. <p> That they 're coming from the NFL 's only present-day dynasty does n't hurt, either. The Bears will practice against the Patriots at their Foxborough, Mass., facility Monday through Wednesday before Thursday 's exhibition game at Gillette Stadium. <p> Coach John Fox likes that the team gets to practice the practical planning of a long road trip, and that his players can learn to spot tendencies over four days against once-unfamiliar opponents. <p> Bears guard Kyle Long knows the benefits of playing against a different team in practice.( AP) <p> " You get to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go against a different competitor. So there are a lot of benefits. You go against a really well coached team over there. <p> " They give us an idea of, really, where we 're at. " <p> Since 2001, the Patriots have won four Super Bowls, lost two more and missed the playoffs only twice. <p> " We all know, perennially, they 're one of the better teams in the league, " Long said. " And it 's always good to go practice against somebody like that. " <p> The Bears will be tested this preseason. They lost their exhibition opener, 22-0, to the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos. Their all-important third preseason game is at home against the Chiefs, who won a playoff game last year. <p> " It 's a pretty good test out of the blocks -- one we welcome, " Fox said. " We get time to get better before we go to Houston( for the season opener). " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended for the first four regular season games because of " Deflategate " -- as well as star tight end Rob Gronkowski and his new running mate, former Bears tight end Martellus Bennett. <p> " They have great players, great tight ends, great receivers, " linebacker Christian Jones said. " Everybody knows about the quarterback. It 's going to be exciting for our defense to match up against them and see where we 're at. " <p> Last year, the Bears found great benefit in a similar trip to Indianapolis that ended with a 23-11 victory. <p> Receiver Kevin White missed that trip because of an injury, but is excited for his chance this week. <p> " Just going against another opponent, learning from it, " he said. " Getting better and competing. "
