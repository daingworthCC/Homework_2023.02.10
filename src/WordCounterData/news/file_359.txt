3061241 <p> Pete Townshend <p> Benefit for Maryville Academy <p> 9 p.m. Sunday <p> House of Blues, 329 N. Dearborn <p> Tickets : $ 175 <p>( 312) 923-2000 or( 312) 559-1212 <p> What, you may wonder, is the Who 's Pete Townshend doing out on the road this summer? <p> The Who 's glorious " Quadrophenia " revival ran its course last year. Townshend has been beavering away at his autobiography ; singer Roger Daltrey, his bandmate, jokes that it 's taking so long they 're calling it War and Pete. Townshend has n't put out a new album since " Psychoderelict " in 1993. He has cashed a lot of " Tommy " -related checks for the Tony Award-winning Broadway show. <p> Townshend 's surprise appearance this summer has to do with wanting to atone for his behavior at Woodstock in 1969, when he cursed out stage-crashing provocateur Abbie Hoffman and knocked him off the stage. It has something to do with feeling those creative juices surging again. But there is no short answer with Townshend, perhaps rock ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> How self-critical? <p> " I think perhaps being in a band that fails ultimately, the way that the Who failed in the end, " he says, "( due to) circumstances out of their control, maybe, clouded the way that I looked at my career and my music. " <p> The Who as a " failure. " This, he says, is a comment directed at their last two, lukewarm studio albums, " It 's Hard " and " Face Dances. " But here is how Townshend 's current kick start came about. <p> " I took a short period about six weeks ago to make the trip over to work with my editor in New York, " says Townshend, from his London studio. " I went and did that work, working on a whole new set of chapter headings, sorting out research material for the rest of the book. I 'm still working on it very hard, and enjoying doing it, although, dear God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... what writing this book is doing for me is actually releasing all kinds of musical creative juices, which it would be crazy for me to try to bury. So to some extent, this( tour) is something that I decided to do to take time out and release some of that. " <p> It 's just three dates : Boston ; Woodstock, N.Y. ; and, Sunday, a benefit in Chicago for a children 's orphanage, Maryville Academy.( He also will appear on " Late Night with David Letterman " Thursday.) <p> " In the last couple of years, " the 53-year-old Townshend continues, " I 've done a whole series of solo performances, which have been experimental and small. I think Danny Socolof, who 's involved in the Woodstock show, saw me up in New York 's Supper Club( playing a small show), and I think that 's the kind of place that I occupy. That 's the kind of performance that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little place. But suddenly( the music) seems to be empowered, and I think empowered partly by the fact that as I write about my childhood, as I write about my years at art school, some of which involves going and talking to the people that taught me, and talking to people that I grew up with, finding that actually I was very, very smart. <p> " What I 'm doing at the moment is... everything that I want to do. I mean, it 's the most extraordinary time in my life. I really feel like I 'm in the middle of my life, and very much at the center of it. " <p> Which brings us to the day of atonement. The Woodstock Music and Arts Festival is remembered as the apotheosis of the hippie era : peace, love and left-wing politics all bound together in one muddy, huggy package. Townshend, more skeptical and cynical, whacked Hoffman off the stage. <p> " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says. " And I think it 's time that I grew up. " <p> Issue a mea culpa? <p> " Oh, yeah. " <p> But was n't a young Townshend ticked off for pretty good reasons? <p> " Well, that 's OK( to say), " suggests Townshend, " but you know what then happens is the years pass and I failed to acknowledge that because I was the dissenting voice, and there were 1 million people there, and one of them had a rotten time, that 's been the voice that has been heard loudest. And I think where I am today, I look back and I think that I learned something vital, and I experienced something vital, and my career took a vital turn there. And the Who 's career took a vital turn there. It 's a good time for me to go and stand on that lawn again. " <p> What will happen? <p> " Well, there will certainly be an Aristotelian debate which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up with it. I think it would be worthwhile, would n't it? Talking about what happened at the time. It was n't just that I argued with Abbie Hoffman. I also argued with Mike Wadleigh, who was the director of the movie. Despite the fact that I kicked him in the head, he went on to cut a very exciting and dynamic piece of footage. I do n't think I was wrong particularly. I think it would be wrong for me to say I was wrong. I 'm not trying to reverse what it was that I said, or take back what I said. What has happened for me is I look back and I think actually Woodstock was not the beginning or the end of a dream. <p> " I mean I found myself kind of thinking and talking about( the fact) that Woodstock was kind of an end of an era. But I do n't think that that 's right. Given enough distance, it was a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English performers but mainly the American performers and the American audience, realized that it was OK to be who they were. <p> " It was OK to be Americans. It was OK to be young Americans, that there were 1 million of us, and we were n't even trying and there were 1 million of us. It was unnecessary to shout and scream and stamp our feet. We were in control. <p> " I wish that I had not handled it as I did. When I look back at( Hoffman 's) life, I feel sorry for him. It 's a strange feeling to have for such a kind of spunky, crazy, dynamic kind of guy, but you know he faded with, what 's the word, with his obsolescence of that whole mood, the function of that kind of revolutionary instrument the Chicago group was supposed to represent. <p> " We had that( movement) in the UK too. But when we realized, after Woodstock, all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was going to be any revolution, we would only overthrow ourselves. We were in our early 20s. Some of us were in our late 20s. We were already running the( expletive) country, or we were well on the way. " <p> Here 's what Townshend wo n't bring to the stage in the coming week : a drummer and a bassist. Townshend was inspired by seeing new pal Bob Mould( Husker Du, Sugar) play dynamic solo shows. <p> Townshend will play selections from various phases of the Who 's history and his own solo career. He says he has no plans to emphasize or de-emphasize hits. <p> He 'll be joined by **28;185;TOOLONG Jon Carin( a former touring musician with Pink Floyd), Jody Linscott on percussion, bassist Sherman Sean, harmonica player Peter Hope-Evans, and singer-guitarist Tracey Langran. <p> As to Townshend? Well, the old hearing-impaired gent who shunned electric guitar during most of the " Quadrophenia " show will pick up the electric ax here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small Fender amplifier that they discontinued for a while. It 's got kind of an old-fashioned mismatched sound, but that 's working very well for me onstage. It 's not too loud, and I it play a fair bit. " <p> What, then, is the pop artist 's role? <p> " They 're meant to be the bunch of flowers that 's on the table for today until you replace them with new ones, " Townshend says. <p> Who is Pete Townshend? " I 'm a generic celebrity. It 's like I bring myself and my history to the stage. So what 's interesting now about going to Woodstock is that I 'm grasping all that stuff head-on. And I 've mismanaged it terribly in the past. " <p> Now, of course, he gets another shot.
