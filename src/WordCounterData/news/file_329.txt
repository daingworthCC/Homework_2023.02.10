3055841 <p> The time was early fall 1900 ; the place, New York City. <p> The opulent Madison Avenue apartment had been draped in black for the funeral. Undertakers, mourners, clergy and the day 's honored guest, Houston millionaire merchant William Marsh Rice, dead at 84, all waited in the hushed, stuffy rooms for the eulogies to begin. <p> Then came a pounding on the door. <p> Outside stood coroner 's officers with orders to confiscate the body. Suspicious circumstances - an apparent effort to raid the dead man 's bank account, an outlandish will no one believed, arrangements for speedy cremation of the remains - convinced authorities of the need for an autopsy. <p> The results were electrifying. Rice had n't died of old age and a stomach complaint. He 'd been murdered. Day after day, citizens of New York - Rice 's home for four years - were jolted as new details were trumpeted in the era 's penny press. <p> The killers, they were told beneath garish three-inch headlines, were none other than the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, one-time Texas lawyer named Albert Patrick. The pair hoped to cheat the businessman 's heirs out of millions. <p> The big victim in the intended scam was Rice 's dream school, an as-of-yet unstarted institute of science and art in some bayou-bound backwater far, far west of the Hudson. <p> In the hands of New York 's journalistic sensation-mongers, the Rice story became the hottest attraction of the new century. But today, despite its competent chronicling in two scholarly books and a popular play, much has been lost in obscurity. <p> Even on the campus of Rice University - now one of the nation 's premier private liberal arts institutions - students who daily pass the memorial under which Rice 's ashes repose often possess only the sketchiest knowledge of his life and death. <p> On Saturday, the 100th anniversary of Rice 's murder, administrators, faculty and students will seek to redress the benign neglect in a brief wreath-laying ceremony at the Rice statue on the university quadrangle. <p> Later that day, university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest fund-raising campaign in Rice history - " Rice : The Next Century. " The effort will seek to raise half a billion dollars for upgrading of undergraduate, graduate and outreach programs. <p> Recently, Gillis lauded Rice as a titan of the university 's first years. <p> " There 's quite a story we could tell about how William Marsh Rice touched so many other lives, " Gillis said. " But he would n't have been very happy about being the center of attention. He was a ' we ' person, not an ' I ' person. We at Rice are very comfortable with that. " <p> When William Marsh Rice, a 21-year-old Massachusetts-born store clerk with entrepreneurial aspirations hit Houston after the panic of 1837, philanthropy was the last thing on his mind. <p> Astutely assessing the spirit of his new home, a muddy hamlet of perhaps 4,000 residents, he contracted to run the bar of a leading hotel. Quickly, he added 320 acres of prime farmland to his holdings. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profitable mercantile partnerships, supplying a floodtide of settlers with goods from New York, New Orleans and other urban centers. <p> " He was a very shrewd businessman, " noted Rice University history professor John B. Boles. " He essentially became an import-export merchant. This was a growing, booming town, and anything you needed to buy, he would sell. " <p> With a flare for promotion, Rice annually awarded a gold trophy to the farmer who brought in the first 20 bales of cotton. <p> He became a banker, formed a navigation company that transported ice from Boston for use during Houston 's steamy summers, created and directed railroads and a cotton compress and amassed huge tracts of land in Texas and Louisiana. He served as a city alderman and held other public positions. <p> By the outbreak of the Civil War, Rice was one of the wealthiest men in the state, with property valued at $ 750,000. <p> Rice was a merchant, not a planter, Boles said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fervently opposed secession. <p> Nonetheless, at the war 's outbreak, Rice donated his Houston home for use as a military hospital and relocated to Matamoros, Mexico, to trade with Confederate vessels breaking through a U.S. blockade of Southern ports. <p> At the war 's end, the Texas economy was in shambles. That collapse and the death of his wife Margaret in 1863 pushed Rice to move to Dunellen, N.J., though he remained active in Houston business. <p> Still solidly in the ranks of the wealthy, Rice married Elizabeth Baldwin in 1867. As his Texas business interests rebounded - he built a cottonseed oil plant and in 1885 purchased what would become the Rice Hotel - Rice for the first time turned his thoughts to philanthropy. <p> Although his formal education had ended at age 15 and his personal correspondence was marked by numerous misspellings, Rice gradually became enamored of founding a free co-educational institution or an orphanage based on models in Philadelphia and New York. <p> " He originally was thinking in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. <p> But while on a business trip to Houston in 1886 or ' 87, Rice was approached by school board President Cesar Maurice Lombardi about financing construction of the city 's first public high school, an undertaking officials flatly rejected. <p> " Rice was cautious and shrewd, " Boles said. " He essentially said he would think about it. " <p> In April 1891, Rice returned to Houston with a different plan. <p> Instead of financing a high school, a municipal responsibility, he contended, Rice agreed to fund a free institute of science and art for the city 's children. <p> The details were vague - the actual form of the institution would be determined by its directors after Rice 's death. That 's when the bulk of the funding would be provided. In the interim, Rice committed $ 200,000 to the effort. He returned to New Jersey. <p> " For the rest of his life, he continued doing what he did best - making money, " Boles said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died after suffering a series of strokes that may have left her confused. After the funeral, Rice was astounded by his wife 's will, which left several bequests to her relatives and others, all unseemly in their generosity. <p> At the urging of associates and friends, Rice challenged the will. <p> It was during protracted efforts to resolve those problems that Rice moved to the swank Berkshire Apartments on Madison Avenue, accompanied by Jones, a young Rice Hotel worker hired as a secretary. <p> It was at that time, that Patrick, a Houston lawyer who fled to New York City to avoid disbarment and who worked as an agent for the Houston attorney defending Mrs. Rice 's will, entered the picture. <p> Rice, still robust despite his age, was said to be worth about $ 3 million. <p> " We knew the butler did it - and precious little else. " <p> Doug Killgore, Houston businessman and playwright, was talking about his student days at Rice University in the mid-1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said. " No one talked about this story. " <p> As he delved into the university archives, he discovered the seminal research of historian Andrew Forest Muir, the treasure trove of turn-of-the-century newspaper accounts. The details revivified the long-dead philanthropist. Rice, Killgore surmised, was a frugal man, gruff but not without kindness, a man whose life was worthy of exploration on stage. <p> The result was The Trust, a two-act drama that recently completed its ninth run at Main Street Theater. <p> Historians believe the charismatic Patrick, then in his mid-30s, became acquainted with Jones and the proportions of his employer 's wealth while beating the bushes for anyone who could help buttress the legitimacy of Mrs. Rice 's will. <p> Patrick beguiled Jones with the pleasures of New York 's tenderloin. <p> He suggested that Rice had neglected to include the deserving secretary in his will, that the old man had murdered his wife, that Rice, in fact, deserved to die. And that Jones - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To all appearances, Jones remained a faithful servant to Rice, who grew increasingly eccentric. He cheerfully gathered Rice 's clothes as the octogenarian stripped while walking through his rooms. He good-naturedly helped Rice in his hour-long exercise sessions, which consisted of thrashing around on a blanket spread on the apartment floor. <p> Still, by the early summer of 1900, Jones, at Patrick 's behest, routinely administered toxic mercury tablets, commonly used as a laxative, to Rice. He weakened and often complained of excruciating stomach pain, but failed to die. <p> To the killers, Rice 's tenacious grip on life proved increasingly annoying. On Sept. 8, the Galveston hurricane wrecked Rice 's cottonseed mill on the Gulf Coast and he authorized $ 150,000 for its repair. <p> Jones and Patrick fretfully watched the dimensions of their expected fortune dwindle. <p> On Sept. 23, 1900, Jones attempted to administer liquid poison in the guise of medicine to the ailing Rice, but the old man declared it bitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who provided him with chloroform and again suggested Rice deserved to die. <p> Rice - so weak he could not walk - quickly fell asleep when Jones carried him to bed. Then, the secretary poured two ounces of chloroform into a sponge, placed it over the face of his recumbent boss and left the room. <p> The result was fatal. <p> Jones returned to burn the sponge in the kitchen stove. <p> The death was attributed to senility and diarrhea. <p> At the time of the dark deed, Patrick had been singing hymns with other tenants in his boardinghouse 's parlor. <p> What seemed a perfect crime quickly began to unravel. <p> Within hours of Rice 's death, a Patrick associate named David Short attempted to cash a $ 25,000 check drawn on Rice 's account at the S.M. Swenson &; Sons bank. <p> The document raised immediate suspicion. <p> Rice rarely wrote such large checks, and his signature seemed irregular. Furthermore, although the check was payable to an " Abert " Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short left without his money but returned minutes later with a corrected document. <p> Banker Eric Swenson compared the signature to known Rice signatures, and his concern grew. He called the Madison Avenue apartment to obtain Rice 's assurance that the check was legitimate. Jones answered the phone and quickly vouched for its authenticity. <p> Minutes later, Swenson called again, demanding to speak with Rice. He was told Rice was dead. <p> Swenson, obviously shaken by the episode, consulted with an attorney, James Gerard, who urged Swenson to telegraph Rice 's Houston associates concerning the old man 's suspicious death and his pending cremation. <p> Then he visited the district attorney and a physician who had examined Rice. Finally, he met with Patrick, who coolly advised Gerard that the will providing funds for the university no longer was in force. Months earlier, he contended, the ailing businessman authorized a new will that essentially left the school without a cent. <p> He also told Gerard that Rice had assigned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 a year for life. " The old man had tired of life and had tired of business, " Patrick said. <p> Gerard and Swenson took that startling information to prosecutors, resulting in a coroner 's order for an autopsy. <p> On Oct. 4, Jones, the secretary, and Patrick, the lawyer, were arrested on forgery charges and incarcerated in the city 's formidable prison, The Tombs. <p> When pathologists found a lethal amount of mercury in Rice 's body, Jones issued a full confession - claiming he saw Patrick hold the chloroform sponge over Rice 's face until the old man died. <p> Later, back in The Tombs, Jones used a penknife supplied by Patrick in an attempt to slash his throat. During his subsequent hospital stay, Jones reiterated his confession, still blaming Patrick. <p> Patrick 's attorneys quickly produced boardinghouse hymn singers to provide an alibi for their client. But, after again unsuccessfully attempting suicide, Jones confessed a third time. He admitted he administered chloroform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901, Patrick finally was indicted for murder. <p> On March 26, 1902, he was convicted and sentenced to die in New York 's electric chair. <p> Patrick had powerful allies, though, most significantly Addie Francis, who first was his landlady, then his wife. Francis, who married Patrick while he was incarcerated, raised money for her husband 's legal defense and lobbied important politicians. <p> On Dec. 20, 1906, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. On Nov. 27, 1912 - just four days after the doors opened at Houston 's new Rice Institute - Patrick was granted a full pardon. <p> He moved to Oklahoma, where he practiced law without a license and sold automobiles and air conditioners. <p> He died in 1940. <p> Jones, the key witness, was not prosecuted. After Patrick 's trial, he was allowed to return to Texas with his brother. <p> Jones committed suicide in his brother 's Baytown home in 1954.
