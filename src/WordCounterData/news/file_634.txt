4137341 Tom Brady has made a career torturing opposing NFL teams, and the Steelers are no exception. The franchise that proudly displays six Super Bowl trophies in its headquarters on the South Side might have two more if it were n't for New England 's star quarterback. Talk about being deflated. But the Steelers are not alone. No NFL team has a winning record against Brady, something Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, Brett Favre, Dan Marino or just about any other great quarterback can claim. Brady has an unbeaten record against seven NFL teams, but the Steelers are n't far behind. They are 2-7 lifetime against him, with two significant losses coming in the 2001 and 2004 AFC championships at Heinz Field. What 's more, they have never beaten him at Gillette Stadium( 0-3), site of the NFL 's regular-season opener tonight between the Steelers and the defending Super Bowl champions. Of all their regular-season losses, none were as lopsided or embarrassing or cataclysmic or historic as their most recent meeting in 2013 - a 55-31 loss that set a franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed in the team 's 82-year history. " Lord help us if they do that again, " said defensive coordinator Keith Butler, who makes his debut as the replacement for legendary Dick LeBeau against, arguably, the greatest quarterback in NFL history. " I hope they do n't. " Only two other quarterbacks - Montana and Terry Bradshaw - own as many Super Bowl rings as Brady( 4). But neither of those quarterbacks own as many passing records or rank statistically as high in every major all-time passing category as this three-time Super Bowl MVP. In fact, only four quarterbacks in history - Manning, Favre, Marino and Drew Brees - have thrown for more yards and more touchdowns than Brady. Those four have combined for three Super Bowl rings, one fewer than Brady. " Just the way my daddy would have liked it, " said Butler, son of an electrical engineer who tested rockets and missiles for the government. " In order to be the best, you got to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steelers? In nine games against them, he has completed 68.1 percent of his attempts, thrown for 2,638 yards and 20 touchdowns and has a passer rating of 109.64. He has been picked off just three times by the Steelers in 323 career attempts, though not once since a victory in 2005, five meetings ago. Here is a look at what Brady has done to the Steelers since he came into the league as a sixth-round draft choice in 2000 : Patriots 24, Steelers 17 AFC championship Jan. 27, 2002 Brady was injured late in the first half after completing 12 of 18 passes and had to be replaced by former starter Drew Bledsoe, who needed just four plays to give the Patriots a 14-3 lead with a touchdown pass to David Patten. In his second season with the Patriots, Brady became the starter in Week 2 and led New England to the conference championship, where they were heavy underdogs to the host Steelers. Patriots 30, Steelers 14 Sept. 9, 2002 Eight months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady christened new Gillette Stadium by throwing for 294 yards and touchdowns to three players who were n't even with New England the previous time the teams met - Deion Branch, Donald Hayes and Christian Fauria. At one point, Brady threw on 25 consecutive plays, breaking open a 10-7 game with two touchdown passes in a 17-point third quarter. " We did n't lose this one, " receiver Plaxico Burress said, " We got whipped. " Steelers 34, Patriots 20 Oct 31, 2004 Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers ended New England 's unbeaten record and 21-game winning streak by scoring 21 points in the first quarter. It was Brady, not Roethlisberger, who looked like a rookie, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble as the Patriots lost for the first time since a 20-17 defeat against the Washington Redskins Sept. 28, 2003. Patriots 41, Steelers 27 AFC championship Jan. 23, 2005 Four months after a mistake-filled loss at Heinz Field, Brady and the Patriots won the game that mattered most, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at the Super Bowl. Brady was n't prolific, just precise, passing for 207 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions in running his postseason record to 8-0. Patriots 23, Steelers 20 Sept 25, 2005 At Heinz Field, the injury-plagued Patriots rallied behind their quarterback, who completed his final 12 passes, to win on Adam Vinatieri 's 43-yard field goal with : 01 remaining. The defeat ended the Steelers ' 16-game regular-season win streak. Brady finished 31 of 41 for 372 yards with one interception. He has not thrown an interception since against the Steelers. " They showed us why they 're the champs, " inside linebacker Larry Foote said. Patriots 34, Steelers 13 Dec. 9, 2007 Brady passed for 399 yards and four touchdowns, two to Randy Moss and two against Steelers safety Anthony Smith, who had guaranteed a road victory against the unbeaten Patriots( 13-0). Brady 's touchdown throws gave him 45 for the season, four behind the record of 49 held by Peyton Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who rarely criticizes an opponent, said of Smith, " We 've played against a lot better safeties than him. " Patriots 39, Steelers 26 Nov. 14, 2010 Brady maintained his mastery of the Steelers, throwing three touchdown passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski and scoring himself, to run his record against the Steelers to 6-1. Four of those five victories have come at Heinz Field. The Patriots were coming off a humbling 20-point loss, but Brady completed 30 of 43 passes for 350 yards with no sacks or interceptions. " They beat us in all phases, " Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. Steelers 25, Patriots 17 Oct. 30, 2011 The Steelers( 6-2) controlled the ball for 39 minutes and kept the ball away from Brady on a chilly day at Heinz Field, never allowing him to get into a rhythm. Roethlisberger outdueled Brady in this game, completing 36 of 50 passes for 365 yards and two touchdows as the Steelers won their fourth in a row after a 2-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pittsburgh Steelers and, looking back on the past, how he 's owned the Pittsburgh Steelers, " linebacker LaMarr Woodley said. " I think everybody forgot about our offense a little bit and the things they 've been doing out there. " Patriots 55, Steelers 31 Nov. 3, 2013 One week after he was held to mere 116 yards passing by the Miami Dolphins, Brady threw for 432 yards and four touchdowns as the Patriots piled up the most points scored in a game that season. It was the most points and yards( 610) allowed by a Steelers defense. " They did a good job in getting some mismatches a couple times on us, " Butler said. " They ran some play-action passes that gave us problems. " Brady has been posing major problems for years against the Steelers.
