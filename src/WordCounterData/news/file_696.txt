4191441 <h> Protesters storm the barricades, politely <p> Protesters are detained and cited as they climb past a barrier set up by police at the Democratic National Convention( Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) <p> DAY 1, 5:53 p.m. : One by one, like passengers escaping a disabled airplane, a protester would step out of the crowd, carefully hop over the metal barricade and then politely and immediately get detained by the waiting police. Meanwhile, the crowd chanted, " Election fraud, election fraud, election fraud. " <p> At one point a whole crowd of protesters tried at the same time to hop over the waist-high metal barricades outside the Wells Fargo Center, where the Democratic National Convention is being held. But even that became orderly after a few seconds of frenzy. <p> " Whoa, whoa, whoa! " the cops said to one guy trying to hop the fence quickly. The protester stopped. " Wait your turn, " a smiling officer said. " You 'll get arrested. " He did, and he was -- at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secure perimeter around the DNC tonight, and police told me there have been 55 civil citations issued for disorderly conduct. <p> From where I 'm sitting, I can see a police officer holding plastic zip ties like a bouquet. Hundreds more protesters stand outside the gates of the convention hall, calling for an end to the superdelegates system, the end of money in politics, and for the nomination of Sanders for president. <p> I had been following around several dozen protesters with Democracy Spring for a couple of hours, knowing they were planning to engage in some civil disobedience that might get them arrested. <p> They had come down Broad Street in the 93-degree heat. Protesters wore yellow or blue ribbons as clues to their roles -- yellow for the marshals managing the crowd, light blue for the " tactical " team. <p> " Can we talk like this? " Desiree Kane, 34, of Denver asked me as we walked backward, side by side. She had a yellow ribbon, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock singer about to fall backward into a crowd of her fans. She was trying to keep people from blocking the view of the enormous " DEMOCRACY SPRING " banner at the front of the crowd. <p> " At some point, asking over and over again -- it goes nowhere, " Kane told me. So " we 're going to rush up on the steps of the DNC and crash the party. " <p> The Democracy Spring protesters caught the police guarding the perimeter of the Wells Fargo Center by surprise at first, and they broke past a barrier some bicycle officers had created with their bikes. Then, singing the national anthem and " This Land Is Your Land, " they sat down and watched the police place metal barricades in front of the crowd. <p> At that point, protesters started hopping over. Most were n't really trying to get through the wall of police ; it seemed they were just trying to get arrested and make a statement. <p> " I feel great! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Silver Spring, Md., told me from beyond the barricade, where a police officer had handcuffed him with a zip tie. " People got to stand up and make change.... It 's time for the people to take a stand on our corrupt election system. " <p> And then, as they did with everyone else, the police took him away. <p> ------------ <p> For the record, 4:48 p.m. : An earlier version of this post reported that more than 50 protesters were arrested. In fact, they were briefly detained and issued civil citations. <h> Training for trouble, and other lessons in civil disobedience <p> Mugshots of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks at Arch Street United Methodist Church in Philadelphia( Matt Pearce / Los Angeles Times) <p> DAY 1, 11:25 a.m. : " Agents provocateurs, " said the honey-voiced man standing before the altar. " What is an agent provocateur? " <p> At the Arch Street United Methodist Church near Philadelphia City Hall, activist groups from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ready for the Democratic National Convention to begin. This is the place where they have been training for the civil disobedience they promise is soon to come, and for the arrests that might follow. <p> When I walked into the sanctuary, a group called the Bernie PeaceKeepers were taking nonviolence training from Dion Lerman, 60. Police mugshots of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. were propped on the altar behind them. <p> The goal of the training is to prevent or de-escalate violence. A projector beamed advice onto a screen : No violence, no weapons, do n't get arrested, do n't run, act collectively, " Serve the people gladly! " And look out for agents provacateurs, people from the opposition who might be lurking, quietly trying to start trouble. <p> " I 've been doing this kind of training for 40 years, " Lerman told me. " The Bernie people are really people of good will, with a lot of experience and a lot of passion about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacekeepers wore laminated lanyards around their necks that said, " Standing up together for Bernie 's platform, I support his progressive ideas and ethics in a peaceful and positive way... Absolutely. #BeLikeBernie. ' I do NOT support violence of any kind. ' " <p> That 's one ideology of many here at Arch Street United, where I also spotted a supporter of the Revolutionary Communist Party in the lobby, and kids with black bandanas who looked dressed to engage in black-bloc-style mayhem, if they wanted. <p> " This place is bursting with groups, from peacekeepers to anarchists, " said Susan Britton-Seyler, a 66-year-old Quaker from Chester Springs, Pa. <p> Last night, the peacekeepers shared a training space at the church with the anarchists, which led to a little friction. " I got called a white supremacist, " Britton-Seyler said with a shrug, noting that at the time, well, almost everybody in the room was white. <p> Britton-Seyler said she came to the Democratic National Convention to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to be angry protesters. " And even though she was " Bernie or Bust " -- the left-leaning equivalent of " Never Trump " -- she and her group were single-minded about being peacekeepers. " <p> But it was time to go ; the peacekeepers ' time slot in the chapel had ended. <p> As the peacekeepers left, another activist group, Juntos, spilled into the room in green shirts that said " Si Se Puede, "( " Yes, We Can ") fresh off a march calling for immigration reform. As they collapsed on the pews to escape the screaming heat, they placed large photos of Latinos and signs that said " DISMANTLE ICE " -- an apparent reference to Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- at the foot of the altar. <p> The Democratic National Convention is going to hit some in-flight turbulence in Philadelphia. I can already tell. This morning, I 'm staring at a full calendar of protests that includes training sessions for civil disobedience. <p> One popular grassroots organizing site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're willing to get arrested with " hundreds " of others this week to protest " to end the corruption of big money in politics and ensure free and fair elections. " " We the People must nonviolently disrupt business-as-usual until we have a democracy that works for all. " <p> Last week 's Republican National Convention in Cleveland was, depending on your perspective, either a police state or a model of control. You had a small bunch of communists and Christian fundamentalists running around Cleveland yelling at each other while thousands of police officers played moderator, sort of like a heavily militarized debate camp. <p> It 's worth reflecting for a moment on why Cleveland did n't yield the election riots that the press corps had feared for months. It 's not like those fears came out of nowhere. I covered a couple of Donald Trump rallies in Southern California that ended with crowds of protesters and police in the streets, with Latino teenagers brandishing Mexican flags and telling me they were afraid of a " civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists often protest the Republican conventions. <p> The activists and protesters simply did n't show up in Cleveland. Not in numbers, anyway. <p> But they 're here in Philadelphia, which is easier to get to from the big Eastern cities, has more places to stay, and, probably most importantly, has Bernie Sanders. Sunday 's left-leaning demonstrations -- attended by thousands of people across the city, I 'd guess -- were already larger than anything that happened in Cleveland. <p> As if to underscore the point, two of the first protesters I met Sunday outside Philadelphia City Hall were from Youngstown, Ohio, about an hour 's drive outside Cleveland. They had come to Philadelphia to protest the Democrats, but they had not driven down the road to Cleveland to protest Trump. Fear was a big factor, they said. <p> " To be honest, everything that I 've seen at Donald Trump rallies, it 's just a giant hatefest, " said Ashley Vaughan, 24, who supports Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from stuff like that, " she said. Why go alone into the lion 's den when she can come to, say, environmentalist rallies where protesters share her views? <p> " Cleveland was looking a little scary. They had fences up everywhere, " said Brandon Gorcheff, 23, who lives in Youngstown but commutes to Cleveland for work. " At least I do n't see people here walking around with guns, " as open-carry advocates had done in Cleveland. <p> Plus Gorcheff, who thinks the primary process was slanted against Sanders, would rather be " fighting for what I believe in than fighting against people who are not going to listen to me, " he said. " I felt my time was better used coming here. " <h> The march from City Hall <p> CONVENTION EVE, 4:06 p.m. : I 'm typing this as I march down Broad Street, where the 97-degree heat is making my phone burn like a hot brick in my hand. <p> If anyone was wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters from marching and rallying outside the Democratic National Convention this week, I can tell you the answer already appears to be no. <p> For almost an hour now, hundreds of pro-Sanders protesters( and possibly more, I ca n't even see the back of the crowd) have been parading -- slowly -- from City Hall toward the heart of the convention events in south Philadelphia. That 's a distance of more than 3.5 miles, giving today 's procession the flavor( to me) of a high-spirited death march. <p> Only a few onlookers were standing on the sidewalks outside as a " BernieVan 2016 " led the proceedings, with chants issued through a huge Ghostbusters megaphone wielded by millennials on top of the vehicle. <p> I spotted a woman holding a sign that said " Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk, #FeelTheBern. " I had just ducked into a gas station to buy two Gatorades after plowing through two bottles of water, and she was ready to walk and talk. <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lynchburg, Va., said when I asked her how she was holding up. " It 's a historic, remarkable moment to be a part of. " <h> ' Another former Democrat. ' Philly is full of them <p> CONVENTION EVE, 2:28 p.m. : Rebecca Waring 's sign said " ANOTHER FORMER DEMOCRAT brought to you by DWS and the DNC. " The DWS stood for U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. The DNC stood for the Wasserman Schultz-headed Democratic National Committee. <p> The recent leak of internal Democratic committee emails -- apparently showing the supposedly neutral national committee 's bias against Sanders -- has already whipped up resentment among the Sanders supporters who are gathered around Philadelphia City Hall. <p> " I made this after I read the emails on WikiLeaks, " Waring, 57, of Baltimore, told me. " I was just horrified. So unfair. " <p> I saw another woman with a sign taped on her back that simply bore the words " WIKILEAKS " and " DNC, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sanders supporters I spoke to already believed the primaries had been tilted against them -- that there had been some kind shenanigans or outright fraud that skewed the vote toward Hillary Clinton. <p> The emails have now only hardened that view among some supporters who talked to me. <p> If I have any prediction for how the Democratic National Convention will go when it starts tomorrow, all I can tell you is that it 's going to be in the upper 90s all week and the Berniecrats plan to be out in force on the streets of Philly, protesting the party and agitating for a miracle. <p> It 's 95 degrees right now, and I 've already seen more protesters this morning in Philadelphia than I saw all last week in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention. <p> In fact, I 've been wandering through a crowd of at least several hundred demonstrators who gathered around Philadelphia 's City Hall for a climate activist rally, and I still have yet to see a single Hillary Clinton sign, button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from the anti-fracking and anti-climate-change signs : Sanders shirts. Sanders buttons. A few Green Party shirts. A guy dressed in a rat suit and a sign that says " DemocRATS give rats a bad name, " holding a giant pencil with its own small sign that says, " Write in Bernie. " <p> And this was just the first of several rallies and marches planned. There 's a " March For Bernie " planned near here in a couple hours. <p> I moseyed over to a gentleman with a pro-Sanders sandwich-board setup and asked him what he thought about Hillary. " Who 's Hillary? " responded Mark Kelderman, 60, of Brownsville, Wis., deadpan at first. <p> The race for the Democratic nomination is over in all but name only. But like many Sanders supporters I talked to this morning, Kelderman wants the superdelegates to vote for Sanders even though Sanders has endorsed Clinton. <p> " After I got done throwing up, I decided I would make my own vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton or Donald Trump. " At this point, maybe Jill Stein, " the Green Party candidate. <p> I asked him what it would take to make him vote for Clinton. " A brain injury, " Kelderman said. " I do n't see it happening. "
