4135641 I ca n't stop thinking about Iraq War veteran James Hassell today. " All I want to do is live the American dream that I fought so hard to protect, " he told me two years ago. " All I ask for is a little bit of normal life. " He came so close. In 21 years at the Register I 've interviewed hundreds of veterans, and yet Hassell stands out. He represents the war hero we deify - and the war hero we ignore. During the 2004 Battle of Najaf in Iraq, he risked his life to carry a wounded buddy 60 yards through open gunfire. When a Newsweek photographer captured the moment, Hassell said : " We 're Marines. That 's what we do. " And yet the war left him - like many of the 2.5 million veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan - vulnerable to nightmares, sleeplessness, hypervigilance, bouts of anger and drinking. When I met him in 2011, it seemed as if James Hassell had gotten the upper hand on his demons. He was married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was in his grasp. Finally. But the price of heroism is greater than most of us will ever know. They met in an Anaheim 7-Eleven. She was 18, buying a soda. He was a 20-year-old Camp Pendleton Marine visiting Disneyland. When another customer made a crude remark, James Hassell intervened : " Stop messing with my girlfriend. " A few minutes later, he told her she was pretty and asked for her number. Sherryl Hassell recalls both versions of her husband, James : the man she knew before Iraq, happy and upbeat, and the man who returned from the war. " He had panic attacks, " she says. " He had nightmares. He 'd yell out of nowhere. I 'd ask, ' What 's wrong? ' And he 'd say, ' I do n't want talk about it. ' " James Hassell once read me a list of symptoms a doctor ascribed to him after leaving the Marines in 2008 : And there were more. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told me. " Now I 'm coming back here and who 's going to help me? " At the time, he needed a small loan - enough to pay two months ' rent until his GI Bill benefits kicked in. Only one person would help him : Deane Tate of Veterans First in Santa Ana. She cried upon hearing his story and cut him a personal check. Hassell paid his rent and later paid Tate back. " He came back and said, ' I do n't have the money, but I have me and I have time, ' " Tate recalls. " He volunteered for us. He worked off the loan. " At the time, I was writing stories about Iraq and Afghanistan veterans - about the 300,000 with brain injuries and the nearly 500,000 with PTSD and the lack of jobs for them all. In my story, James Hassell became an example of perseverance. James Hassell was my success story. Who knew what his demons were still capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband out on the street corner, hours on end, talking to buddies on the phone. " It was a way for him to be in his own little world, " she says. " He did n't want me and my daughter to see it. He wanted us to be happy. " James Hassell was one of the most insightful veterans I ever met. He 's the one who explained to me the stages that many combat vets face returning from war. First, there is gratitude. Then, anger at the world and sleeplessness, which ratchets up the anger. Then comes self-destructive behavior, like drinking, drug abuse and speeding in a car. Then, ideally, comes the potential happy ending - rebuilding your life. You ca n't be who you were before, Hassell explained. You must learn to accept what you did. And talking about it is the only way to get there. " Once you pull that trigger and kill someone, you 're not the same. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You did it for your country, and there 's honor in that. But you 're still going to see those faces. I guarantee it. " I once asked him how many Iraqi deaths he was responsible for and he told me. It was more than I guessed. Horrifically more. " The best thing I can do is, be a good husband to my wife and be a great dad to my daughter and be an even better human being, " he told me. " If I live my life by a code, with the same zest that I served with, I 'll be OK. " He tried until the night of Aug. 29. Sherryl awoke in the middle of the night and saw her husband outside on the street corner, yet again. " I tried to ask him, ' Are you OK? ' " she says. " He said, ' I 'm fine, fine. ' I wish he would 've told me how he really felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning, James Hassell barely got out of bed. He made it to the kitchen. Then his heart gave out. Sherryl found him on the floor. No pulse. By that afternoon, Hassell was on life support. By the next day, Saturday, he was critical. By Monday his brain shut down. " It 's hard hugging someone knowing that you 're hugging them for the last time, " Sherryl says. " I did n't want to let go. " Heart failure killed James Hassell at age 30. But what brought that on? " They asked me for( his prescription pill) bottle, " Sherryl says. " It was empty. I try to monitor it, but I ca n't always stay up. " I just wish that night I did n't sleep. " What if it turns out the pain in Hassell 's life became unbearable, the demons unstoppable? It 's unclear. What is known is this : Hassell had one last mission. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Hassell agreed to be an organ donor. That became James Hassell 's final act before doctors unplugged his life support. Eyes, other organs - everything usable went to others. " I was talking to him, " Sherryl says. " I told him, ' You know, James, you are a hero - even to the end. You 're going to give someone else another chance to live. ' " And that 's why I 'm thinking about James Hassell today. In many ways, he 's still an example of perseverance. In many ways, he 's still an example of success. And in every way, he 's an example of the war hero who we, as a nation, can no longer ignore. 714-796-6979 or tberg@ocregister.com
