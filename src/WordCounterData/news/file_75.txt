3014541 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiche or a soup with heady truffle flavoring? Are crystal, linen and a beautiful setting part of your daily diet? <p> Welcome to Michel and Christine Guerard 's luxury hotel at Eugenie-les-Bains in southwest France, where dieting is not only still " in, " it is a pleasure. A 310-calorie menu manages to look and taste like an unbelievably voluptuous gift from culinary heaven. <p> " It still works, " said Michel Guerard, the 59-year-old three-star Michelin chef who made a sensation with his " cuisine minceur " 18 years ago. <p> Diets are spurned by the disillusioned as unhealthy and ineffective. But Guerard keeps his figure and trims others ' by living up to the pleasures of healthful food. <p> His success is legendary, as all guidebooks praise him for being France 's most truly inventive and creative chef - three stars in the Michelin guide for both gourmand and minceur( diet) cooking. <p> The Gault-Millau guide also accords top marks and says, " This man never makes a mistake. " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet, Guerard modestly says other chefs also are doing well creatively. <p> " It 's very simple, " he said in the Victorian-style billiards room adjoining the hotel kitchen. <p> " Fresh, and more fresh ingredients are the secrets of all good cuisine. It 's very important in diet food. " <p> Out back he has an impressive herb garden that looks as ordered as Versailles. It 's near a former convent now converted into a chic hotel annex with bright curtains, fireplaces, visible beams and flowers all over. <p> " Our minceur cuisine has evolved, " he said, as he rushed into the kitchen to taste a soup reduction. " We now work effortlessly, without difficulties, with vegetable purees and white cheeses for the diet dinners. Before, we were experimenting for the taste effects. Now, we know instinctively what to do. <p> " We base our diet cooking on regular dishes, cutting down on calories by eliminating things like flour and butter. But taste is all-important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> Diet diners in the " old days " - nearly 20 years ago when Guerard moved down here with his wife, Christine Barthelemy - were once served at long tables reserved for dieters alone, a kind of segregation. <p> " Now, it 's more friendly. The dieters do n't feel so ' different, ' " said Guerard. Many of the diet or minceur and regular gourmand dishes are similar. Both dieters and gourmand eaters share the same gracious dining room decorated by Christine, owner of the hotel her father bought for her. <p> Serious dieters can shed weight here, quite painlessly. " I did well, " said Jan Pettigrew, a recent visitor from London, who said she lost several pounds easily. <p> Guerard explained his methods : " My cannelloni aux herbes( with a herbal mushroom filling) can be made with fine sheets of celeriac, rather than our regular pasta. It is almost indistinguishable from that on the gourmand menu. <p> It 's exciting to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular menu is somewhat richer - say, a ragout of sweetbreads, fava beans and crayfish, with butter in the sauce, rather than a salmon with herbs, served to the diet choice. <p> But dieters come away feeling very satisfied, especially after a dessert like the gratin of mandarin oranges with its light vanilla custard sauce( no cream). <p> The young Guerard was already a revered chef for his innovative cooking ideas over 30 years ago when he ran a cozy little bistro in Asnieres, a rather seedy Paris suburb. <p> Gastronomes went there to try out his incredible puff pastries, his absolutely fresh fish, mushrooms, tiny green beans and foie gras in salad. <p> Born in Vetheuil, Normandy, in 1933, Guerard had long savored his grandmother 's cooking and decided that cuisine was for him. His first game was " chef " for his schoolmates, making up little dishes from his grandma 's grocery shop - " things like sardines or jam and bread, whatever. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " said Guerard, who nevertheless passed the difficult baccalaureat tests for university entry. <p> " But I was a gourmand, and went to work for a chef in the Paris suburbs. " There and at a couple of other restaurants he learned the basics of everything from pastry to sauces. <p> By the time he opened up his little Pot au Feu in Asnieres in 1968, he had mastered all disciplines, including the legendary layered puff pastry. <p> Too much butter and tasting left him feeling fat. <p> " I tried all kinds of diets, had kidney trouble and arthritis, " he said of that period, in the early 1970s. <p> At about the same time, he met his future wife, Christine. She was looking for a chef for her hotel, an establishment attached to a sulphur-water spa and dating from the early l9th century. They married in 1974, and Guerard took over the cuisines of Eugenie as well as his own diet. <p> " I found the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Guerard. " It was based on my grande cuisine dishes but would eliminate all that fat and cholesterol. " <p> Soon, using vegetable-based sauces, ground up in a blender and sometimes augmented with a little fromage blanc or cottage cheese, Guerard was turning out tasty diet dishes. " They were often cooked by quick-steaming or grilling, " he said. <p> " Nothing new in diet cooking, but mine had to taste perfect. They were made from the best ingredients " - which he went all over France to procure. <p> Today, Guerard 's cooking is just as sophisticated as ever, carried out by his head chef Garry Duhr, with himself as final master. <p> " I do travel and have contracts consulting with firms like Nestle and Findus frozen foods, but here is where my home is, and I like to stay home and cook, " he said. <p> He and Christine also are keeping up a vineyard they bought with the Chateau de Bachen, near the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique decor, tennis courts, swimming pool, the baths and spa. The specialty of this spa is to cure rheumatic and digestive problems, including obesity. <p> The Guerards have bought up surrounding property, and now in La Maison Rose, they have a simpler hotel where chef Garry Duhr gives cooking demonstrations to women and men taking the sulphur-water cure in the luxury Eugenie baths( part of the main hotel). <p> During a recent lesson, Duhr charmed the curists with a demonstration of Coquilles St. Jacques - a warm scallops salad with plenty of herbal sauce and excellent vinaigrette - and a chicken " truffled " with herbs and mushrooms chopped finely and inserted under the skin. <p> The finely chopped stuffing mixture, redolent of tarragon and chives, was mixed with French white cheese( fromage blanc), and Duhr carefully inserted it under the chicken skin. <p> " But we 're not using butter, " he said. " Just a tad of olive oil on the stick-proof casserole dish to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour in a medium-hot oven. It was very dark on the outside, warm and moist inside with the under-skin stuffing. <p> " Always taste for your herbs and seasoning, " said Guerard later. " That 's our main secret. Try to please yourself with fresh, healthy foods, with variety. Do n't go in for fad diets. "
