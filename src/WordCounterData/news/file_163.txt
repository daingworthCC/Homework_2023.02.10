3032741 <p> When most people think of their dream house, they relax, sit back comfy in their armchair and let their minds float in the air. When Catherine Simon-Fernandez and Jaime Fernandez thought of their dream house, they got out the pens, paper, nails and 2-by-4s. <p> The Fernandezes are not your average Washington couple. Simon-Fernandez, who is French, came to Northern Virginia with her parents when she was a young girl( her father was with NATO and her mother worked at the French Embassy). Her husband was born in Panama and moved to Los Angeles with his family at age 6. The two met in San Diego, moved to this area eight years ago and have n't changed their style one bit. If you pass the bungalows and occasional Tudor on Oriole Avenue in Springfield, you 'll see a gray and purple stucco house so cool it looks as if it could wear sunglasses and sip on a cold tall drink. <p> Simon-Fernandez, who designed the house, has very definite dislikes. She does n't like colonials, gingerbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even like brick. <p> " I do n't care for the materials and designs in Northern Virginia and the D.C. area, " she says. " So I picked a vernacular from an area I liked, the sunny areas like California and Florida. " Her house was influenced in part, she says, by the kind of art deco architecture seen in Miami. Not everyone in the area, as they were to learn, shares their unconventional taste. <p> The Fernandezes did n't care either for the traditional way of buying a dream home. " This save to buy a small town house, let it appreciate, sell it, buy a bigger one, sell that and slowly work your way up to a 3,000-square-foot house was not what we had had in mind, " says Simon-Fernandez. <p> So they decided to bypass a few steps and build the 3,000-square-foot house themselves. <p> He would build it, capitalizing on his background as a general contractor, cabinetmaker, custom marble worker, set designer, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. His wife, who worked 5 1/2 years as a designer for an architectural firm in Alexandria, would draw up the plans for the house. It took six months to design, a year to build. They moved in last fall. <p> Today Catherine Simon-Fernandez is making homemade ranch dressing in the white and black state-of-the-art kitchen. Behind her is a sleek black refrigerator waiting patiently to pour her ice water. To her left stands a double electric oven so savvy it took several days to figure out. In front, bright green lettuce and scarlet tomatoes wait on the granite counter, which she designed to the fraction of an inch. <p> Simon-Fernandez pulls out eight 24-by-36-inch construction drawings, detailing structural calculations, foundation and framing plans and code requirements, which she worked on by hand and with the use of a computer-aided drafting and design( CADD) program. She fine-tuned the drafting as the idea blossomed in her head and as she discussed choices with her husband. <p> " I 'm more angular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money was a problem but they attacked it methodically. The couple rented a small house in Newington for seven years, saving enough to buy 3/5 acre in Springfield for $ 39,000 and an additional $ 28,000 for materials. They then obtained a construction loan for an additional $ 149,000. Because construction costs relate directly to the square footage -- usually from $ 125 to $ 140 for a custom-built home -- Simon-Fernandez concentrated on making the rooms as small as she could, and ended up drawing a 2,700-square-foot house. <p> In the end, she says, the house cost $ 158,000 to build, excluding the lot. She says the last property assessment put the house and land over $ 300,000. <p> You enter their three-bedroom house through a two-story atrium filled with coconut and yucca palms. Inside, you move from open space to open space, not closed room to closed room, gliding through passageways that lead from east to west or north to south. " That way you 'd never get lost, " Simon-Fernandez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, study, game room, powder room, living room and kitchen. From the second floor -- which holds a large master bedroom, a second bedroom, a baby room and two bathrooms -- a family room with fireplace looks down onto the two-story living room. The living room has a 17-foot ceiling ; on the walls are three 4-by-4-foot paintings done by a friend. Throughout the house, the geometric windows( some stepped, some rectangular and flanked by squares) are covered simply with black venetian blinds, which accent their unusual lines. <p> Wanting an asymmetrical exterior, but fearful it would look clumsy or lopsided, Simon-Fernandez decided to tie together the irregular lines of the windows with bold purple tiles across the front and sides. The designer chose a shade she could live with -- eggplant -- and brought the color inside to highlight the stair rails, entryway lamps and furniture coverings. Because it was too expensive to cover the entire exterior in tiles, they finished the rest of the house in gray stucco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over to her husband and stood back. But what appears crisp and clear on paper can turn to mud in real life. <p> There were problems from day one. <p> There was the sewerage problem. The lot could n't take a septic tank and was too far away for county sewerage hook-up. Simon-Fernandez soon found herself in negotiations that would make a lawyer cross his eyes in order to hook up their sewerage with a shopping center located behind them. <p> There were several delay problems. It took two months for Fairfax County to approve the site plan. Then the first contractor they hired to dig the foundation took two months to begin, and ended up not doing it according to building codes. <p> There was, sadly, the tree problem. When they hired a civil engineer to clear the lot, he mistakenly was given an early plan, which had placed the garage in front of the house instead of to the side where it stands now. From a fully wooded lot, barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road. <p> " There were a lot of times, " she says, " when I wished we had bought the town house. " <p> Once the foundation was finally poured, Jaime Fernandez went to work, and did everything except the stucco work, the mechanical and the electrical( though he was there right beside those contractors, supervising). He began by framing the house with $ 15,000 worth of lumber -- Douglas fir and hemlock. <p> At this point the clock was racing. Their construction loan( which gave them one year to build before they had to start making payments) began in February 1989, yet the foundation was not completed until August. They would soon begin paying the mortgage on a house with no electricity, no windows, no walls. <p> Fernandez built the atrium, milling the pieces on site instead of buying them precut. The light now shines into the atrium, through rain-sensor and remote control windows, and bounces across the house. " It turned out, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could imagine. " <p> Seven days a week, Jaime Fernandez started pounding nails at 6 a.m. and did not drop the hammer until 11 p.m. " I was so exhausted I 'd go out to my truck to go home and fall asleep in my driveway, " he says. He lost weight, his eyes turned red and weary. " It was getting too much. I thought I should see a shrink. " <p> The Fernandezes say they would n't have been able to finish without the help of their friends. People stopped by weekends and after work with hammers in hand and helped install dry wall. <p> " I 've never seen so many guys hanging out, having a good time, " remembers Simon-Fernandez. In fact, she says, their friends now complain, " It 's not the same anymore ; it 's a house. " <p> Simon-Fernandez and one friend put up much of the drywall, measuring and cutting up pieces, applying the adhesive glue and nailing them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces up to them. <p> " It 's going to be a busy year with all those pay-backs, " she says, " all those, ' I 'd like a deck, ' ' I need a basement. ' " <p> There were times when the ordeal became dangerous. Fernandez now sports a half moon on his cheek where one morning a one-gallon can full of lacquer fell from the roof onto his face. On his wife 's legs are distinct scars from the time she fell 18 feet from a ladder while painting the second story windows and landed in the hospital with a broken jaw. <p> " Of course, now I 'm happy, but there were times..., " Simon-Fernandez says, rubbing her chin. <p> While they built, the pair shopped around for interior materials. Many of their materials come from companies that Fernandez had worked for. He is proudest of their master bathroom with Jacuzzi and separate shower which they covered in Mexican marble in a spectacular rosada salmon. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We knew it was one of the only luxurious things we were going to have. You know how people say, ' I never use our Jacuzzi. ' Well, we 're in there three or four nights a week, " Simon-Fernandez says. As they lie there with the hot water jetting into their skins, they sigh, " This is the reason we built this place. " <p> The rest of the interior, however, became a problem when two very strong opinions competed for finite space. " What can you do, we both have got to live there, " asks Simon-Fernandez. Which is why, she adds, art deco was a good blend for them -- " it brings us from contemporary, which is me, to the mod ' 60s, which is him. " <p> She especially likes the art deco stair rails, which she designed and her husband built, cutting the wood himself and laquering each piece. Then Fernandez, who grew up in the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and designed the etched glass window that looks from their bedroom into the atrium. " It 's straight out of his psychedelic acid days, " says Simon-Fernandez. <p> Her husband also insisted on bull-nosed( rounded) corners, an innovation he brought with him from California, " It 's a nice soft look. " There are not conventional door or window casings, he says. " Then again, " says Simon-Fernandez, " there 's nothing much conventional about this house. " <p> It is the norm during construction for the architect-contractor relationship to be adverserial. The architect usually represents the owner, spending his time overseeing the construction, making sure the contractor is proceeding according to plans. The contractor, Simon-Fernandez says, represents himself and his wallet. <p> " When you 're architect, builder and owner at the same time, it gets heavy, " she says. The situation pitted husband and wife against each other. " He was deviating and I was freaking out. I would see things not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And since he is also the owner, you ca n't yell at him. " <p> There was the time Fernandez decided that the three-foot powder room was too narrow and widened it a foot, taking the extra space from the kitchen aisle where there was to be a bar stool as well as a walkway. <p> " I could n't figure out what was wrong, " remembers his wife. " The placement of the windows on the adjacent wall was different and I kept coming in with my tape measure, measuring the windows and trying to figure out how I 'd gone wrong when I suddenly realized that the whole wall had moved. " <p> Fernandez was encouraged in no uncertain terms to move it back. <p> In addition to designing the house, Simon-Fernandez designed much of the furniture, including the Pullman-style sink base in the master bathroom, the entryway table, and the brass-based and glass-topped dining room table. She even designed the pattern of her china -- purple strips and red-orange geometric shapes. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch and entranceway. After that they will turn to landscaping. " And then Jaime has to build a tree house for our son, " says Simon-Fernandez, who is expecting their first child this month. <p> As they sit at their black kitchen table, eating stuffed pasta shells and homemade garlic bread, the Fernandezes grin at each other and answer the obvious question. <p> " We 'll never sell it, " says Jaime. <p> " Our hearts and souls are in it, " says Catherine. <p> Still, their efforts are not always appreciated. Their Miami-style gray and purple exterior is not what you expect in a neighborhood of red brick and whitewashed houses. Many a car has screeched by, they say, its driver throwing a beer can at the door and yelling at the top of his lungs, " It sucks. "
