4189741 <p> Containers on the waterfront at Virginia International Gateway in Portsmouth, with Norfolk Southern 's coal piers across the river in Norfolk Thursday, December 31, 2015. <p> It was a big " ask " -- and it paid off. <p> The General Assembly has signed off on an unprecedented $350 million state-backed bond deal that will give the port the money needed to expand capacity at Norfolk International Terminals, its largest container operation. <p> The package still needs the final blessing of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, though he was its prime mover. <p> " This is huge for the commonwealth of Virginia and the port, " said Aubrey Layne, state transportation secretary. " It says we 're open for business. " <p> The lawmakers ' vote to back the financial-aid package came a year after congestion stretched port operations to the breaking point, driven by container volume increases that broke records three times by the fall. <p> It also followed a dramatic financial turnaround highlighted in July, when McAuliffe announced that the Virginia Port Authority was able to report a profit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged by the vision and support of the General Assembly in including the $350 million investment in The Port of Virginia in its bond package, " said John Milliken, the chairman of the authority 's board, in a statement. " Not only is this an investment in the future of this port, but in the Commonwealth 's economy as well. " <p> The General Assembly approval came nearly seven years to the day that the first privatization bid to run the port was announced. <p> It was one of a series of bids that unfolded over several years, putting the future direction of the port in limbo, along with decisions about investing in its infrastructure. <p> From fiscal year 1970 through fiscal year 2012, the commonwealth gave the authority more than $1 billion in funding, according to a 2013 report by the state 's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly 's watchdog arm. <p> Roughly 68 percent of that amount came in the form of an annual allowance through the Commonwealth Port Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's Transportation Trust Fund. <p> About 31 percent came from general funds, most between fiscal years 1970 and 1997, used primarily for operating expenses, according to the report. <p> Some general funds, however, have been appropriated for such things as land development at Craney Island, a rail project and dredging. <p> The yearly port fund contribution, now roughly $40 million a year, is intended to be used for capital expenses. <p> In the fall, when port officials announced that they would make the request, they said the money generated by the bond deal would enable Norfolk International Terminals to handle another 696,000 standard 20-foot containers a year by 2019. The terminal 's current capacity is about 1.4 million a year. <p> The build-up at NIT will be vertical for the most part, with containers stacked closer together and higher, emulating procedures used at the port 's other big container terminal : Virginia International Gateway in Portsmouth. <p> Parallel to the push to grow NIT is the hope to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lease of VIG that could culminate in the acquisition of the facility. <p> When the original, 20-year lease was signed in 2010, it was projected to cost more than $1 billion in rent payments by the time it expired in 2030. <p> Assuming the lease extension unfolds as planned, the rent will increase significantly to help cover the cost of a roughly $320 million expansion of the facility, doubling its capacity. <p> The General Assembly just approved potential relief on that front, too. Lawmakers enacted a provision in the budget that would let the authority use up to $10 million a year in Commonwealth Port Fund money to offset the higher rent payments, at least for the next two fiscal years. <p> The arrangement could be renewed over the length of the extended lease, officials said. <p> In 1967, J. Robert Bray joined the Port Authority as general counsel before becoming its executive director 11 years later. <p> Over the course of his four decades at the authority, he said, he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " No, sir, " he said, chuckling. " This is fantastic. " <p> It 's the kind of money that the port needs to grow its capacity and chart its future, he added : <p> " It shows a great deal of faith in the port from the governor and the General Assembly.
