3068041 <p> Of lies, hypocrisy, witch hunts and Hillary <p> Most Americans have believed that balancing the budget was the nation 's top priority. Once again, Americans are learning different. <p> It is speculated the first lady has told a lie, that some advice provided by her was bum advice that did n't help an Arkansas savings and loan, which failed, and that she did not favor a particular travel office. <p> To determine the level of crime committed, if any, Sen. Sal D'Amato of New York has formed a committee perhaps superior to that of Sam Ervin 's committee of several years past. <p> This committee, known as the Committee of the Immaculate, comprises only those senators who in a lifetime never told a lie, not once missed church on Sunday and never, ever took a nickel they had n't earned. <p> Supported by unlimited taxpayer dollars, the Committee of the Immaculate will discover the truth. <p> Thus America will be made a safer place for children, who will in turn be taught the importance of never telling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HOLLIS B. BACH <p> Castle Rock <p> I 'm not sure how many watched the Jan. 12 Barbara Walters interview with Hillary Clinton. I do believe, however, that most of those viewers think they heard Ms. Clinton say she would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Whitewater investigators and set the record straight. <p> " Why do n't you just go up to Capitol Hill and talk to the Senate subcommittee yourself and get this all over? " Walters said. <p> " Well, we 'll cooperate and will do whatever is necessary. There is nobody who wants this over more than I do. I really want it to be finished with, " Clinton said. <p> " And if it takes your going and testifying, you 'll go? " Walters asked. <p> " I 'll do whatever it takes to cooperate, " Clinton answered. <p> Compare this with the lead story in The Denver Post the next morning, " First lady fighting back. " <p> Paragraph four states that Mrs. Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitewater, saying that it would not be a fair forum. Obviously, she will not " do whatever it takes to cooperate, " if that means testifying to the Senate. This equivocation is consistent with distortions that proceed regularly from this woman, who William Safire described as a congenital liar. <p> As comedian Mark Russell said, Safire was misquoted and Hillary Clinton is a " congenital lawyer, " which is even worse. <p> ROBERT YOUNG <p> Denver <p> Edwin Yoder 's Jan. 14 column defending Hillary Clinton tries to rationalize two im <p> portant aspects of Mrs. Clinton 's behavior that deserve criticism. <p> First, he calls her role in the firing of the White House travel office staff merely " impolitic, " " unfair, " " inept " and that her explanation merely displayed a lack of candor. The firings and Mrs. Clinton 's role were much more than that : They were quite simply, morally and fundamentally wrong! The allegations against Billy Dale proved to be so flimsy that they were easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Dale 's reputation is forever damaged, and his life savings are gone. <p> Second, Yoder posits that Mrs. Clinton 's explanations of her public conduct in Arkansas and Washington were just sort of putting her best foot forward as a social crusader, not as a tough lawyer or a canny commodity speculator, not that there is anything wrong with either of these latter two pursuits. <p> What is wrong about being a commodities speculator is that Hillary and Bill Clinton rode into town on their holier-than-thou high horses, excoriating those wretches who made huge paper profits manipulating the market in the late 1970s and ' 80s, while Hillary herself surely qualifies as the Queen of the Obscene Profit with her 10,000 percent profit in cattle futures! <p> Many of Hillary 's explanations are designed to camouflage this blatant hypocrisy! <p> LEE A. SELLERS <p> Northglenn <p> Chavez 's column on feminists defies logic <p> In order to prepare for " Radical feminists never rest "( Jan. 14), Linda Chavez may have read the introduction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm she 's never read a single academic journal. Why is it that when her targets are academics, a newspaper editorialist is n't required to do honest research about - or even talk to - the people she 's " exposing? " How can I trust her lessons, her dire warnings about semiotics and deconstruction when she demonstrates in writing that she does n't know the difference between a symbol and a signifier? <p> As always, these questions are secondary to this one : Which group of people and which interests are served by attacking the cultural studies that go on in universities? Chavez should remember that the rhetoric she defends has always had much more institutional power than the jargon she attempts to translate. If it were true that the feminists hiding under the bed owned things like banks and mining corporations, then Chavez 's argument might have a foundation. As it is, the essay is - to eliminate jargon from this letter - stupid in the most straightforward sense of the word. <p> BRIAN ARTESE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chavez 's article on, " radical feminists. " Remember, " radical feminists " won suffrage for women. <p> I charge that our society 's language is propaganda. Our language was created by people in a patriarchal society. It is n't some innate thing from nature. <p> I do n't understand why she would like female firefighters to be called firemen. They are n't men. Jobs that use gender-specific terms to describe the people who work there are going to attract more people of the gender used in the job title. Maybe she does n't think women belong in certain fields, and that 's why she 'd like the unnecessary term " man " left in the title. <p> English grammar rules are n't innate either. To say that " he " is a generic term inclusive of both men and women is absurd. I actually had a professor in class tell us an anecdote about how in the Little League he coaches he managed to get one of the boys on the team to play harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy felt so put down at being called a girl, he played really hard. He was fighting mad. <p> Do we want to teach our children that being called a female is an insult? <p> If " he " really is generic and inclusive of men and women, why do we have the term she? Maybe " she " is generic and we could use " she " to be inclusive of men and women. <p> FRANCES H. SGARLATTI <p> Denver <p> Lamm 's column an insult to intelligence <p> Dottie Lamm asks " Whose kids are they anyway? "( Jan. 21). The answer is that they are their parents kids. Why is that people like Lamm always want the government to protect our children? When I was growing up there was no pornography on TV, but there were programs my parents considered worthless and I was n't allowed to watch. I was n't allowed to read " Mad " magazine unless I also read something " good. " <p> Pass a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? How ridiculous. The two obvious and insurmountable problems are : 1. It ca n't be done. Anyone who wants to can get what he wants. This is the same insane concept as outlawing guns in the belief that that will keep criminals from getting them. 2. Who will decide what is indecent? I think that many of the newspaper and magazine articles I read on the ' Net are indecent. Will the Post be willing to pay a fine of $ 10,000 if a minor reads a column that I find indecent.? <p> I find Lamm 's column indecent. Not that it insults my sense of sexual propriety ; it insults my intelligence. <p> MICHAEL BROUILLETTE <p> Littleton <p> Stop the chest-thumping <p> I have simple request : Stop advertising on the editorial pages! <p> I have read both Denver dailies regularly since I moved here in 1985. My respect for you falls every time I read an article about circulation that is written as a news story. Any intelligent 6-year-old realizes that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 14) publisher Ryan McKibben( Jan. 7) have me really aggravated. Correct me if I am wrong, but should articles in the Perspective section not deal with news? As opposed to advertising? Each of the those two Sundays you have had at least one article dealing with the decision of the Rocky Mountain News to discontinue circulation outside the Front Range. I expect you will claim that you are reporting news or commenting on the state of the newspaper industry. I do not think so ; I see you as thumping your chest, proclaiming yourself as the better of the two papers. If you are serious journalists, you should be ashamed. <p> DAVID J. LOECHEL <p> Denver <p> Romero column refreshes <p> Living in Greeley for the past five years has given me a very tainted opinion of the written news media and has pushed me to scorn and distrust any printed information. Thomas Romero 's Jan. 10 article regarding Herman Lujan 's leadership at UNC restored a modest amount of respect that I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lujan as a human being with constant aspirations for education was a refreshing variation from the judgmental, inaccurate articles of many publications. <p> TONYA R.
