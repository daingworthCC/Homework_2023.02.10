4061641 Eugene Monroe surrendered anonymity a long time ago. At 6 feet 6 and 315 pounds, Monroe seldom walked the University of Virginia campus unnoticed during his four seasons as an offensive tackle. He could not fade into the back of a classroom, especially after he developed into one of the nation 's finest players. <p> Even when his size is n't immediately noticeable, Monroe draws attention. Before he changed his privacy settings on Facebook, he received 30 to 40 friend requests every day -- from strangers. Some were from women who knew Monroe was months from becoming a multimillionaire. <p> " He 's one of the top prospects at his position and one of the top prospects across the board, " said an NFC personnel director, who added that he thinks Monroe will be selected in the first half of the first round of April 's NFL draft. <p> Monroe accepts the attention but stops short of embracing it. During his senior season, when asked about his future in the NFL, he would often change the subject to something within his control -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his final college game, but he would still rather talk about what 's within his control -- preparing for this month 's NFL scouting combine. Monroe focuses on that event because the bombardment of praise has just begun. Those who know Monroe want to tell him what they heard about him, and those who have only heard about Monroe want to find a way to know him. <p> " It 's pretty unavoidable, " Monroe said in his hushed baritone. " Every day, I 'm hearing from one person or another. ' I saw your name on ESPN or ' I saw you going top 10 or in the first round. I hear all that stuff. <p> " But I pretty much have the same mentality that I did during the season. The goal right now is preparing for the combine, because that 's the next step for me. I ca n't dictate where I 'm drafted. All I can do is to continue to position myself as the best player at my position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go in one ear and out the other. " <p> Those who are fanatical about Monroe actually have the least in common with him. By his own admission, Monroe did not grow up a football fan. He was involved in martial arts as a child and devoured video games. He watched football for the first time as a 9-year-old, witnessing Reggie White blow by an offensive tackle for three sacks when the Green Bay Packers won Super Bowl XXXI. Monroe considers himself a Packers fan because of that game, but he does not nestle in front of his television on Sunday afternoons. <p> " I 've never really had a big interest, " Monroe said. " If you asked me football history, I 'd give you blank answers. " <p> Yet he has been drawn to the game since participating in informal neighborhood football in Plainfield, N.J., when he was 10 years old. He wanted to join Pop Warner in fifth grade but was too big for his age group. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his advantage. <p> By Monroe 's freshman year of high school, he was 6-1, 250 pounds. By his sophomore year, he had grown three inches. In between, he attended football camps at Rutgers and Maryland and received scholarship offers from both schools. By his senior year of high school, he was the top offensive lineman in the nation and had his choice among just about every major program. <p> Monroe entered the starting lineup at Virginia by his sophomore year and was named second-team all-American last season. He is just as proud that he graduated from Virginia in December -- a semester earlier than scheduled -- and became the first member of his immediate family to earn a degree. <p> Monroe 's personal growth followed the same timeline. His father died of multiple myeloma when Monroe was in the fifth grade. " It was right when you need your father the most, " said Eugene Green, Monroe 's uncle, who became a father figure to Monroe and helped raise him. <p> Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood brother and 14 stepsiblings, and he lived at times with aunts, uncles and cousins -- but he needed to quickly develop personal responsibility after his father 's death. <p> " It seemed like overnight he matured, " said Stephanie Green, Monroe 's mother. <p> Because of that, raising Monroe came without difficulties. He applies the same straightforward logic now when talking about the NFL draft that he used when he was a child. <p> " Finish your homework before you go outside, " Stephanie Green would tell him. <p> " Mom, " Monroe would reply, " I would n't go outside unless I already finished my homework. " <p> Green laughs when recounting those frequent exchanges. It is her way of reminding herself that she does not need to worry about her son. <p> " I 'm not afraid of him being by himself because he 's not a troublemaker, " said Susanne Green, Monroe 's aunt, who also helped raise him. " If I say be home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Monroe spends his idle time wherever home is at that particular moment. He is hooked on his gadgets -- computer, video games, iPhone. During his freshman year at Virginia, Monroe camped out overnight outside a local electronics store to purchase an Xbox 360, earning the nickname " Best Buy " from his teammates. <p> Virginia guard B.J. Cabbell, one of Monroe 's college roommates, marveled at the sound system Monroe installed at their off-campus house and counts on Monroe to fix whatever breaks. Monroe took an interest in Photoshop during his senior year and learned Web design even though it was not required for his sociology major. During off hours, as he trains for the combine in Bradenton, Fla., Monroe plays online video games against his cousins. <p> One of those cousins likely will move with Monroe to his future home -- according to online mock drafts, possible destinations include St. Louis, Oakland, Jacksonville, who pick second, seventh and eighth, respectively. He will be in a metropolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for time and money. But Monroe insists he will not change, even though his life -- and bank account -- certainly will. <p> " I think, at least, that best friends, especially with these people I do n't know. " <p>
