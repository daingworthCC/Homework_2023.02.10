5018441 <p> Does Chicago politics descend again into tribal politics and racial coalitions, with appeals to ethnic groups -- the black candidate, the white candidate, the Latino candidate? <p> Or does it continue as a campaign of ideas in a broken city? <p> Where do the oligarchs go, now that Emanuel is out? Does Grosvenor boss Michael Sacks, aka " Mayor Sacks, " a close Emanuel ally with reach at the Chicago Sun-Times, find a new horse to ride? <p> And does former President Barack Obama decide to rediscover Chicago and play kingmaker by anointing someone? Or does Obama take a more subtle approach and simply let it be known that he " likes " a candidate, sending up puffs of white smoke that swing African-American votes? <p> Obama could have helped Emanuel, put his arms around the troubled mayor in the last few trying months, with the mayor 's popularity plummeting among black voters. But he did n't. He 's a one-way street. <p> In Chicago politics, there are no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all out there, unresolved publicly but throbbing ambitiously in the dark. <p> Vallas and Lightfoot are now forced to recalibrate their campaigns and their messages. <p> Though Emanuel is no longer a piece on the chessboard, he made it clear on Wednesday that he still intends to pull Chicago 's strings and dictate a successor. Arrogant? Yes. He ca n't help himself. <p> On WGN-AM radio 's " Steve Cochran " program, the mayor was asked about future candidates dropping in now that he 's dropped out. <p> Emanuel said, coyly, that the next mayor of Chicago has n't yet announced. <p> " Who is it? " Emanuel was asked. <p> He would n't say. But he did channel former President Bill Clinton -- his corrupt former boss -- by riffing on an infamous Clinton verbal dodge. <p> " It depends on what the word ' is ' means, " Emanuel said. <p> It was a comment missed by some. But it caught my ear. <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This game of Chicago thrones is entertaining, yes, but it is also serious business, because here 's what 's at stake : <p> The future of a great city savaged by decades of bad politics and tribal warlords, and the fate of millions of residents who will either flee like refugees or stick around and pick up the bill. <p> Media speculation over the many names that could swoop in for the chance to grab a piece now that Emanuel has withdrawn has angered Lightfoot and Vallas. <p> I 've played the speculation game, too. It 's part of the job. <p> " The media coverage disturbs me, " Lightfoot told me on Wednesday. " To see the media focused solely on the horse race and the powers that be anointing a winner without regard for citizens should be disturbing to everyone. <p> " This notion that city government and the mayor 's office is pirate booty ripe for the picking is offensive, " Lightfoot said. <p> Yes, it is offensive, but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no orderly transition to new leadership, " Vallas told me. " Those who did not have the guts to challenge Emanuel or to support candidates who did have the guts -- because they might be punished -- are now crawling in. <p> " Government leaders resort to politics when they have no ideas, when they have personal agendas, they resort to the politics of spin, distraction, the politics of scapegoating, " Vallas said. " They 're better at managing the news than they are managing government. " <p> Vallas is correct. They did n't have the guts. But gutless politicians playing it safe along the baseboards are a historic feature of Chicago political entomology. <p> One is retiring Cook County Clerk David Orr. After the late Mayor Harold Washington 's death, Orr was interim mayor for a few days. He could have fought to keep the job, but that would have caused pain. <p> Now he wants to flirt with the idea of running for mayor. That costs nothing. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race for mayor should n't be about pirate 's booty. And those who showed little principle or guts to challenge the status quo, yet now wiggle excitedly and swoop in for a piece, are what 's wrong with our politics. <p> But this is Chicago. That 's how they play. <p> Two names loom large, and Lightfoot and Vallas must step up and meet the challenge. <p> Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle is considering a run, as is Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza. <p> Preckwinkle can raise money. She 's been wounded by her ridiculous pop tax plan, earning her the name Toni Taxwinkle. <p> But she is chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. She has experience and toughness. And she has her political protege, Kim Foxx, as Cook County state 's attorney. <p> The last Chicago politician to be both party chairman and mayor was Richard J. Daley. Boss Daley, meet Boss Preckwinkle. <p> A mayoral candidate with the power of subpoena would be formidable. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendoza has an election to win in November. She 's been out publicly, hobnobbing at the City Club of Chicago, and wo n't say much publicly. But she 's interested. <p> She 's blessed with a dynamic, winning personality, she 's Latina and 100 percent Chicago. But she also has ties to the supreme boss, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. And that connection could be problematic. <p> Like it or do n't like it, this is the way things roll in Chicago, which remains, in its heart, the city of tribes.
