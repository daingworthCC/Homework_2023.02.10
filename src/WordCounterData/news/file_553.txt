4128841 Did Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz really think Fox 's cult-favorite comedy, canceled after three low-rated seasons, would ever come back? " I certainly did n't think of it in terms of TV, " he says, partly because " it would be impossible to get everyone together at the same time " to film it. But a few logistical somersaults -- and a deep-pocketed benefactor in Netflix, the streaming service with 23 million subscribers -- has improbably revived the dysfunctional-family sitcom, nearly seven years after Fox dumped it. Netflix is responding to a new generation of fans who discovered the show online, lapping up 53 episodes with the oddball Bluths. In the process, the company is turning the traditional broadcast model of weekly episodic television on its head. The service had subsisted on a sometimes-moldy collection of films, until it began snapping up beloved TV shows as a way to keep customers watching. They 've grown to represent 70% of viewing on the service. Now Netflix is making shows of its own : Starting next month, it will unveil six series viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern set by pay-TV channels such as HBO and Showtime, who lured new subscribers with can't-miss shows such as The Sopranos and Homeland. And Netlifx will offer them wherever it does business, in Europe, South America, Canada and Mexico. A steady stream of streaming originals includes : House of Cards( Feb. 1), a darkly cynical political drama from producer David Fincher( The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) that stars Kevin Spacey as a scheming congressman who plots revenge when he 's outmaneuvered for a political post. " The swath of his sword is never-ending, " Spacey says. Fincher directed the first two episodes, and a second 13-episode season is planned by early 2014 as part of the estimated $100 million commitment. Hemlock Grove( April 19), produced by Eli Roth( Grindhouse), a murder mystery set in a Pennsylvania steel town in which killer creatures are among the suspects. Arrested Development( May), which revives the Emmy-winning series after the reruns were among Netflix 's biggest draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, based on the comedic novel set in a women 's prison, from producer Jenji Kohan( Weeds). Jodie Foster is among its directors. Derek( summer), the latest series from writer/star Ricky Gervais, about lovable losers who work in a nursing home. Lilyhammer( fall), a second season of last year 's series starring Steve Van Zandt( The Sopranos) as an ex-mobster in the witness protection program transplanted to Norway. Unlike online rivals such as Hulu and YouTube, " we 're not trying to figure out how to make cheaper shows, " says chief content officer Ted Sarandos. " We 're trying to figure out how to make better television, " with budgets and talent to match. Netflix outbid Showtime for the right to remake Arrested, and it bested HBO 's offer for House of Cards by promising two seasons upfront. Its shows also will be eligible for Emmy Awards, and today the service will, for the first time, tout shows to the Television Critics Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in very highly serialized storytelling " based on a book, movie or existing show that 's " somewhat well known, " Sarandos says. Unlike networks, Netflix does n't commission pilots ; it orders series based on completed scripts and commitments from actors. And it releases entire seasons all at once, catering to the " binge viewing " method more viewers have developed for cable series such as AMC 's Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, all of which count Netflix as their exclusive TV home for prior seasons. On each release date, every episode will be available for instant viewing on Netflix 's website, mobile apps or Internet-enabled TVs, by all of its $7.99-a-month subscribers. " There 's less risk because we 're not programming for a time slot, " Sarandos says. Nor is he dependent on advertising or companion shows. Instead, a sophisticated recommendation algorithm, like the one used by Amazon, mines data from customers ' prior viewing to suggest viewers check out projects based on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often watch serialized TV or political movies or are known Spacey fans will be pitched Cards, and " we can find an audience over time, " he says. " It 's attractive, because the film industry and now the TV industry has the opportunity to learn what the music industry has n't, " Spacey says. " Give the audience what they want, when they want it, at a reasonable price, and they will buy it and wo n't steal it. " The all-at-once model " flies in the face of everything that 's been going on in television forever, " Hurwitz says, and assumes that voracious viewers always are up to speed. " Part of the experience of waiting for the next episode( forces) the need to create artificial cliffhangers( that) ultimately dilute the storytelling, " Sarandos says. Original shows make up 10% of Netflix 's $2.3 billion content budget, says Cowen &amp; Co. analyst John Blackedge, who applauds the exclusive strategy : " The whole goal is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service, so evolving their content is clearly the best way to do that. " Streaming content drives the company 's subscriber base, which continues to grow even as Netflix de-emphasizes its mail-order DVD business. But Netflix is not forsaking movies. It just nabbed first-TV rights to new Disney movies, starting in 2016, that historically have gone to pay cable channels right after their DVD and video-on-demand release. ' Arrested ' has new rhythm House of Cards was shot in Baltimore in feature-film style. Arrested also applied a new production model, largely because of stars ' commmitments. " Contractually, we could n't use all the characters in every episode ; they were not free to do as much TV as they want, " Hurwitz says. Each of 13 or 14 episodes will focus on one character. Only Michael Bluth( Jason Bateman), the levelheaded son who holds the clan together, appears in all of them.( Michael Cera, who plays son George Michael, also is now among the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different, " Hurwitz says, and is being assembled as a " very, very complex puzzle " from scenes shot out of sequence over many months. Though famous for its layered flashbacks and juggling of multiple story lines, held together by Ron Howard 's narration, new episodes adopt a different rhythm. " We 're not jumping from one thing to another ; you 're staying with one character, " Hurwitz says. Recurring characters played by Henry Winkler and Liza Minnelli, among others, will return, and Howard and Brian Grazer, whose Imagine TV is behind the project, also will appear. " The bigger story is the family has fallen apart at the start of our show, " Hurwitz says. " They all went their own way, without Michael holding them together, so they 're left to their own devices, and they 're not the most successful devices. " The season is designed as a " first act to what we eventually want to do, which is a big movie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made. " Each individual( episode) kind of depicts what happens in 2006 as the Bluths fled from the law on the Queen Mary " in what was once the series finale, then explains what 's happened to them since and leaves them in the present day, he says. The true flavor " slowly reveals itself, as the moment you saw in one show will reappear in another show from a different character 's perspective, " he says. " If people watch it all at once, it will seem like a giant Arrested Development. It 's tailored for Netflix. " a reunion with risks Only once did the full cast reassemble, as the final episode teases a movie by promising an imminent family reunion. " It was such a joy to be back with everybody ; it did n't feel like work, it felt like being back with friends, " Hurwitz says. " You do n't see them all together until you see the movie. " Even apart, " I can assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever. " Netflix is betting passionate TV fans looking for shows they ca n't find elsewhere are the most likely candidates to remain loyal streaming subscribers. " One of the reasons Arrested was n't embraced at the time, was it was n't easy to get your head around it, " Hurwitz says. " It was a point of pride with me ; I wanted to create a show that had surprises. But that 's what they want to do( at Netflix). They want to take risks. They encouraged the complexity that had been discouraged before. " And Spacey says keeping users happy is " a very different way of measuring what you would call success in this form than driving viewers to Sundays at 8. It 's very exciting trying to do something that creates a new paradigm.( But) it could also wind up being a big thud heard around the world. Who knows? "
