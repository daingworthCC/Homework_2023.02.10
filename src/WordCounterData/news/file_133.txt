3027541 <p> If Graham Claytor 's job in downtown San Francisco disappeared tomorrow, he just might commute to the office anyway - for the fun of it. <p> His early-morning ride across San Francisco Bay on the 7 : 15 Alameda-Oakland ferry offers plenty of fresh air and a view of the Bay Bridge and the city 's majestic skyline. In the evening, he can lounge on the back deck, talk to his commuting buddies and toast the end of a difficult day with a glass of wine. <p> " It really is the high point of the day, " says Claytor, a resident of Alameda and the man in charge of abandoning, selling and leasing track that is no longer profitable for the Southern Pacific railroad. " It makes getting to work so much fun. " <p> As commuting time in many urban areas increases - San Diego 's commute jumped almost 14% between 1980 and 1990 to an average 22.2 minutes - the tendency is for people to complain ever more bitterly about the ordeal of getting to work. <p> Yet some contented souls among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, every second of time they spend on their daily journey to the office. They talk about their commutes like proud parents talk about their teen-ager 's SAT scores. <p> " I 've got the best commute of anyone around, " brags James Brown, a software designer for J.P. Morgan in Manhattan. Every weekday morning at his home in Hoboken, N.J., Brown puts on his suit and tie, grabs his briefcase and heads out the door wearing his $ 149 pair of " commuter " in-line skates. <p> He skates several blocks, weaving through the crowd and onto a ferry that takes him across the Hudson River to the financial district - all in 25 minutes, half the time it would normally take. <p> " It 's a very relaxing commute, " he says. " You literally can go 10 blocks in one minute on Rollerblades. " At the end of the day, Brown likes to skate to his favorite bar, grab a beer and gaze at the harbor while he waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent study by the Federal Highway Administration, solo drivers represented 73% of all commuters in 1990, up from 64% in 1980. That may not be great for traffic patterns or the environment, but driving alone can be liberating. Turn up the radio, roll down the window and feel, for a moment, like Geena Davis in Thelma and Louise. <p> " I like to be able to get in the car, crank up the stereo and open up the sunroof, " says Vince Heald, senior account executive for Beck-Ellman, a public relations agency in San Diego. Heald commutes 25 minutes to work in his 1991 silver BMW. " I just love to drive. For me, it 's like therapy on my way to work. " <p> Heald uses his commuting time to plan what he wants to accomplish that his day and to check out fellow commuters. The car you drive and the style in which you drive it speak volumes, he says. " A Jaguar convertible with top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air - that 's La Jolla, old money, " he says. <p> Alan Parker, director of investor relations and special projects for Ben &; Jerry 's in Waterbury, Vt., feels a little guilty about not sharing his 75-minute, one-way drive to work with a colleague. But schedules are hard to coordinate, and someone else might not appreciate his taste for Gilbert and Sullivan operettas played really loud. " It 's tough in the dead of winter, " Parker says of the 45 miles he drives to work each way in a 1987 Ford Tempo with 110,000 miles on it. " But I 'm commuting from a home I love to a job I love. Whatever disadvantages there are, what 's at each end is worth the distance between the two. " An added bonus : Parker drives by woods and ponds. <p> If money is no object and you live in New Jersey, commuting by helicopter to Manhattan is an option. No wildlife, unless you count sipping your morning coffee with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Rivera has commuted by helicopter from his home on the Jersey shore for three years. He now owns the helicopter company and charges commuters $ 25,000 a year for the 14-minute ride, five days a week. " I have the best commute you could possibly have, " he says. <p> " I hate to drive. I 'd rather be in prison than stuck on the turnpike. I ca n't stand not being in charge of my own destiny, " he says. <p> The copter commute from New Jersey takes less time than it used to take him to catch a cab from his Upper East Side apartment to his midtown TV studio, Rivera says. The copter sports leopard-skin rugs - a decorating touch courtesy of his wife, C.C. Dyer - and is piloted by a Vietnam veteran. <p> Low-tech commutes are n't exactly popular in this age of suburban and exurban sprawl. But for those who can swing it, commuting by the sweat of one 's brow has advantages. <p> Dennis Stuhaug bikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Seattle to his job as managing editor of Canoe and Kayak magazine. The 17-mile, one-way ride is like " a mini-vacation, " he says. " It 's quiet, serene, and you 're not hassled by the constant attention you have to give to driving a car. " Some mornings, when " the sky is exactly the right color, " he 'll take his kayak to the lake and paddle across. <p> Stuart Applebaum, a public relations executive for Bantam Doubleday in New York, walks more than 50 short city blocks to work almost every day. He has been doing it for 15 years. " I love it. Rain or shine, warm or cold, I do n't care. It 's my own private secular meditation time. I love the feeling of being able to move forward when so many others are at a standstill because of traffic. " <p> That 's sort of the way Graham Claytor and his friends feel when they look up at the drivers stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferry commute relatively cheap( $ 2.25 one way on a monthly ticket) and fast( 15 minutes one way), it 's a lot more fun, Claytor says. <p> " You see the same people every day. You get to know each other, " he says. One reason the Alameda ferry is so much fun is that Claytor and his gang work hard to make it so. Once a year, they rent a ferry boat and hold a dinner-dance cruise for commuters and their spouses. Every Friday evening, they do something called " taking the late boat early, " formerly known as " the float to nowhere. " Since the boat - which leaves at 5 : 15 from the dock in San Francisco - makes an extra stop, commuters get a little more time to enjoy the trip before the boat arrives at its destination at 6 : 20. Whoever is in the mood that day provides hors d'oeuvres and cocktails for the crowd. <p> Ferry riders have nicknamed the first boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit - known for its frequent mechanical breakdowns - has been nicknamed The Bologna Spirit. <p> The gang is lobbying aggressively to change the name of The Bay Breeze to The Encinal - the name of a Southern Pacific Golden Gate ferry that operated in the 1920s. Bay Breeze has been rejected as too bland. " Those less kind among us thought it reminded them of a room deodorizer, " Claytor says. <p> The commuters have also lobbied, successfully, to improve the quality of coffee served on board. You can now enjoy a cup of European Royale or Vienna Dark Roast with your view of the San Francisco skyline. <p> " We like our commute, " Claytor explains. " But we do n't roll over and play dead.
