3054341 <p> David Wehr remembers the cutting-edge music program he led in the early 1960s at the fast-growing First Methodist Church in Boise, Idaho. <p> Wehr, now director of choral activities at Houston Baptist University and former minister of music at First United Methodist Church of Houston, added cream-of-the-crop activities deeply rooted in classical music. <p> But rapid and radical change has engulfed religious music in the past 35 years. A field once fairly homogenous and clearly identifiable with religion has become a cacophony of sounds. <p> Often it seems no different from the music of secular society. <p> Now a cutting-edge program may be like the one at Houston 's Second Baptist Church. Almost nothing limits the kind of music used at the mega-church, which attracts people from all over the city through an enormous range of facilities and activities. For the holidays, minister of music Gary Moore will present " " A German Christmas Fantasy. " The music will include German folk tunes and an original composition by Moore. <p> In the 1960s, mainline Christian churches generally had a dominant style of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians, and great hymns of the church leavened with the finest American gospel hymns. In large churches at least, musicians shared a fairly consistent commitment to high standards of taste, performance and music. <p> In Boise, Wehr introduced English handbell choirs. He conducted a regional premiere of Leonard Bernstein 's " " Chichester Psalms. " His adult choir sang such major choral works as George Fridric Handel 's Messiah and Johannes Brahms ' " " A German Requiem " with the city 's orchestra. Recitalists often performed on the new Aeolian Skinner pipe organ. <p> Such traditional programs are harder and harder to find in Houston. Only a couple of churches have choirs capable of routinely performing such music. Few churches even have an interest in such a program. <p> For example, almost all black churches today prefer a single style of music, said Clyde Owen Jackson. He has, as he likes to say, retired three times : as postmaster of Galveston, minister of music at Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 94. <p> Once choirs of large congregations such as Wheeler Avenue performed a variety of music : classical anthems ; spirituals, in the four-part arrangements made famous by the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn. ; and gospel music, such as " " Precious Lord " by Thomas Dorsey. <p> Now the norm is contemporary gospel. It is a high-energy music with a signature three-part choral style, a " " star " female singer and accompaniment by rhythm section, organ and wind instruments. <p> Such changes affect even the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism, said Cantor David Propis of Congregation Beth Yeshurun. They use a wider variety of music than they did in the early 1960s, though less than Christian churches. <p> Second Baptist 's music program, though larger than most, exemplifies the contemporary church. <p> The choir is big : 300-plus each Sunday. An orchestra supplements the huge pipe organ and piano. Everything is amplified for both the congregation and the electronic media the church utilizes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classic and gospel hymns. The choir performs anthems often written in contemporary styles similar to popular music. <p> During the Wednesday evening praise service, people may sing a 30-minute continuous cycle of gospel choruses once used only by fundamentalist churches. Words are projected on screens so people can sing them easily - a device increasingly used in churches, including the new Catholic Charismatic Center on Calhoun. <p> Second Baptist 's building contains up-to-date television equipment for broadcasting services and a modern recording studio. <p> This is a space for the mega-church of the 1990s, which strives to hold a central place in members ' lives. <p> While the scope at Second is unusual, its music program highlights major themes of the change in religious music : <p> The intrusion of the vernacular. The most important impetus was the Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church( 1962-65). Its radical change in worship was to authorize churches to use their native, vernacular language instead of Latin. <p> Catholic churches were unprepared. Musicians had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting hymns by the leaders of the Protestant Reformation). <p> Because that change occurred in the 1960s, in the United States it precipitated the now-famous folk mass - liturgical music employing the folk style of the time. <p> The intrusion of popular culture. Folk music was just the beginning. As the 1960s movements of protest, rebellion and revolution seeped into general culture, they affected religious music. <p> Christians dabbled in almost every type of popular music - the Christian rock band Petra even played the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo one year. Some mainline denominations sanitized texts of classic hymns to remove words perceived to condone sexism, patriarchal hierarchy and other topics now considered offensive. <p> Conservative and Reform congregations of Judaism followed right along, said Propis. Composers wrote services in folk, jazz, even rock styles( though texts were not affected). <p> Now there often is no difference aurally between the music played on Christian radio stations and that heard on their secular cousins. <p> So-called contemporary Christian music is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars and Top-40 list in Billboard magazine, the bible of the recording business. The industry is so attractive that Gaylord Entertainment, whose properties include Opryland USA, recently spent $ 110 million to buy Waco 's Word Records, one of the oldest and most successful Christian labels. <p> The most dramatic impact occurred in black church music in the early 1970s, when Aretha Franklin recorded her legendary Amazing Grace album. In it, she sang with the Rev. James Cleveland, who developed the now-dominant black choral style of soprano, alto and high tenor. <p> Black gospel music had female soloists before Franklin, Jackson said. Clara Ward was perhaps the most famous. <p> But Franklin was different. With her, the star-singer phenomenon was born. The crossover between popular and religious music was sanctified. <p> Now almost every black church uses the tools of popular music : some combination of organ/synthesizer, drums, horns( trumpet or saxophone) and electric bass. The kind of choir that sang four-part spirituals has largely disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist Church remembers how simple music once was. In his childhood churches in Houston and Louisiana, the choir sang cantatas of John Peterson. The organ was the Hammond B-3, a staple instrument of 1960s rock music. <p> Now the world is at his fingertips. Moore can carry a keyboard housing a sophisticated synthesizer under his arm. And something as simple as a wireless microphone allows a peripatetic preacher to roam when sermonizing - or Cantor Propis to sing from any part of Beth Yeshurun 's sanctuary. <p> Sophisticated, miniaturized recording equipment - the DAT recorder - enables churches without recording studios to make CDs. <p> Outside the sanctuary, any ambitious mega-church can easily broadcast its services. The electronics-driven marvels of television, cable TV and direct satellite broadcasts are all available for a fee. <p> Taping services for broadcast subtly influences worship. At its recent meeting, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops debated standards for televising Mass. Main services at Second Baptist are choreographed to avoid dead spots. It can seem contrived when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The development of the mega-church. As society has become more mobile, large congregations deliberately set out to attract people from a wide geographic area. The resulting mega-churches need sophisticated, up-to-date music programs as one of their tools to attract new members. <p> The rise of charismatic worship. Once limited to separate white and black Pentecostal churches, charismatic-style worship has seeped into most Christian denominations. Moore says worshipers at Second Baptist 's Wednesday service even raise their hands in imitation of charismatic worship. <p> The combination of secular-style religious music and charismatic worship has had a downside. Worshipers satisfied with highly personal, emotional worship have demanded simple-minded music at the expense of the great hymns of the Christian church. <p> Indeed, like the Catholic Church in the early 1960s, many Protestant churches find themselves losing the musical foundation on which their worship was built. <p> Wehr ruefully admits that church musicians trained in classical music are on the defensive. Committed to high musical standards, they are fighting the flood of popular entertainment into religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had a major part in our survival, is disappearing, " Jackson said.
