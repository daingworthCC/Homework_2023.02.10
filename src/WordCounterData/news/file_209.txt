3040641 <p> Lookout Mountain, Ga. - Bob and Carol Webber have just taken a quantum leap backward in the history of American tourism. Employees of Disney World, they 've driven 540 miles from the virtual reality of Orlando to the craggy antiquity of Lookout Mountain. On a crisp, sunny spring day, they 're meandering down the paths of Rock City, cooing over the geological garden 's weird natural beauty, when something catches Mrs. Webber 's eye. <p> " Oh, I got ta get this, " she says, hoisting the camcorder. <p> Some fantastic rock formation? Perhaps an awe-inspiring view? <p> No, she 's aiming the lens at a small red birdhouse with a black roof and 11 white letters that spell a simple command : " See Rock City. " " I saw these when I was a girl, " she says with a giggle. " They 're great. " <p> It 's hard to say which is the bigger draw on Lookout Mountain : Rock City or See Rock City. <p> Rock City, which celebrates its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But See Rock City - painted on hundreds of barn roofs and thousands of birdhouses - is an advertising legend, an evocative slice of roadscape that has joined Burma Shave signs and Bull Durham broadsides as classics of Americana. <p> Rock City understands this well. A few years ago, the company changed its name from Rock City Gardens to See Rock City Inc. <p> Think about it : How many firms are one with their ad slogan? It 's like AT &T; becoming Reach Out and Touch Someone Corp. or Pepsico renaming itself You Got the Right One, Baby, Uh-Huh Inc. <p> Since the slogan appeared in 1936, See Rock City has become Dixie 's most familiar graffito, the Southern equivalent of Kilroy Was Here. The phrase has been spotted in British subways, on Hong Kong hillsides, in French restrooms, on German walls. <p> Bill Chapin, Rock City 's president, can vouch for that last one personally. " My father slapped one of our bumper stickers on the Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock City sighting came last year during the Persian Gulf War. Like Marines at Iwo Jima, some soldiers from Tennessee erected a Rock City birdhouse in the sands of liberated Kuwait. Maybe they were making the world safe for tourism ; more likely they were just trying to make the desert feel like home. <p> It took years of hustling to achieve that kind of affection. Rock City made sure that generations of Florida-bound families could n't help but see their directive on everything from ashtrays and matchbooks to thermometers and hand fans. <p> " We 'd be in a restaurant in Panama City Beach and the back of the check would say See Rock City, " remembers Tim Hollis, an Alabama editor who 's doing a book on the attraction. " I saw that slogan so many times, I thought there must have been a chain of Rock Cities. " <p> No way. There 's only one Rock City. <p> Perched atop the eastern ridge of Lookout Mountain on the Georgia- Tennessee line, Rock City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitsch. Tourists scrape through a crevice at Fat Man 's Squeeze, bounce across a canyon on Swing-Along Bridge, squint to see seven states from the cliff called Lover 's Leap. Then, in an abrupt mood change, the trail leads to Fairyland Caverns, a chasm filled 45 years ago with shiny rocks and hokey dioramas depicting tales you know( Goldilocks and the Three Bears) and tales you 've never heard of( The Moonshine-Making Elves). <p> Mr. Chapin, 38, knows that many people find this kind of stuff laughable in an age of audioanimatronic theme parks. Yet he resists updating it. " This is the way you appealed to children before Disneyland, " he says. " It 's histtry. Changing it would be like putting a La-Z-Boy in Jefferson 's living room at Monticello. " <p> Mr. Chapin 's hyperbole can be attributed to family pride, for the Jeffersons of this Monticello were his great-aunt and -uncle, Frieda and Garnet Carter. <p> The daughter of German immigrants, Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a subdivision on Lookout Mountain in the early ' 20s, she called it Fairyland and gave the streets names like Peter Pan Lane. The Carters next turned their attention to miniature golf, founding the nation 's first franchise courses, then selling out for a small fortune. <p> Out of golf, Mr. Carter looked for something else to sell. He saw it in his wife 's pet project, a nature trail through the rocky part of the subdivision they 'd never been able to build on. He moved some dirt, blasted some tunnels, built some bridges - and on May 21, 1932, the rock garden opened as a tourist attraction. <p> Only 1,000 people saw Rock City that first year. Desperate for more visitors, Mr. Carter took a suggestion from Fred Maxwell, a friend at Southern Advertising in Chattanooga. <p> Barns. Approach farmers and offer to paint their tin barn roofs. They 'll get a partial paint job and you 'll get a whole billboard. <p> The man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77, he has n't done m uch roof climbing since a power line almost killed him on the job in 1968. But for 30 years before that, he wandered the Eastern states like a sawdust-trail evangelist spreading the good news by painting and repainting up to 400 roofs a year. He 'd swing his ladder across the ridge and decide right there, 20 feet up, whether to hand- letter the simple three-word slogan Mr. Carter coined or something extemporaneous like : ' T would Be a Pity to Miss Rock City. <p> " I was a nut for Rock City, " Mr. Byers says. He points to the roof of his house in Rising Fawn, Ga. " It used to say See Rock City up there. " <p> At first, souvenirs were the only payment offered for renting the advertising space. Later, Mr. Byers began giving owners a small sum and passes to Rock City. <p> " I took a lot of dates up there, " says Bill Hickey, whose old service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock City roof since the ' 40s. " They still send me a $ 5 check every year. I give it to my son and tell him not to spend it all in one place. " <p> By the mid- ' 60s, there were more than 900 Rock City roofs from Texas to New York. They became so widespread that Mr. Carter used to joke about a tourist who came to the ticket booth with an unusual request. " I do n't want to see Rock City, " he said, " I want to see the man who painted all those signs. " <p> Not everyone appreciated Mr. Byers 's handiwork, however. In an effort to clean up the American roadside, Congress in 1965 passed the Highway Beautification Act, restricting outdoor advertising. Rock City had to paint over hundreds of its roofs. <p> Property deterioration, ownership changes and highway widenings also took a toll. The old rooftop slogan certainly has n't faded from view - the company advertises on billboards and sells 20,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Rock City maintains only about 80, the vast majority in Tennessee. <p> This dwindling has accomplished something Garnet Carter never would have dreamed of : Yesterday 's irritating clutter has become today 's lovable nostalgia. Motorists screech on their brakes and whip out their cameras when they see a particularly well-preserved Rock City roof. Some of the barns have even been granted local landmark status. <p> So far, no Rock City barn has made the National Register of Historic Places. But it is n't as far-fetched as it sounds. In recent years, an increasing number of diners, service stations and tourist courts have joined the roster. <p> " We 're just beginning to appreciate the importance of roadside structures, " says Marilyn Harper, who reviews Southeastern properties for the National Register. " Some of these barns should probably be nominated. " <p> Mr. Byers has a candidate. In all those years of painting, his favorite barn was an 80-footer off U.S. 41 in Tunnel Hill, Ga. <p> What made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan or an unforgettable owner. It was the trees. <p> " When I finished painting, " Mr. Byers explains, " I saw that the roof was blocked from the highway by some trees. So I talked the man into letting me take a few down. We cut down two or three and topped another six. When I was through, you could see that sign for three-quarters of a mile. " <p> His round face lights up. " It was beautiful. "
