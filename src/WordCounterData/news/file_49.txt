3006641 <p> LESS than three years after the Palestine Liberation Organization turned to diplomacy to solve the Middle East conflict, the Gulf crisis has jolted it back to a confrontational position - this time alongside Iraq. <p> Sources inside the PLO say the unwillingness of Chairman Yasser Arafat to back the Arab resolution condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait arises from strong rank-and-file Palestinian support for Saddam Hussein as an Arab leader willing to stand up to the United States and Israel. <p> The shift in the Palestinian mood from broad support for a diplomatic solution to full-fledged backing of an Iraqi-led challenge to US interests in the region is viewed by analysts as a backlash to the collapse of the Middle East peace process. <p> Despite pressure from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Mr. Arafat refused to support the Arab League decision at a summit in Cairo two weeks ago to send troops to defend Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi attack. His critics, especially in Egypt, accuse him of contradicting his long-standing argument against the acquisition and occupation of territory by force - such as Israel 's occupation of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kuwait. <p> Western diplomats in the region warn that Arafat 's support for Iraq could cost the PLO its role as the representative of the Palestinian people. They also say it has created a rift within the organization. <p> But some PLO officials deny that their stance is causing division. They argue that the PLO 's opposition to the US intervention in the Gulf is instead enhancing Palestinian unity. <p> PLO officials, however, concede that there is a minority faction, mainly within the leadership, which still hopes for a US shift toward the Palestinians and is therefore pressing Arafat to stay neutral. <p> But most PLO officials argue that the organization could not support resolutions that did not criticize the US presence in the Gulf and instead " provided Arab cover " for the US involvement. The officials say they are more alarmed by the US military involvement, which they fear will undermine any chance for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories, than by the Iraqi invasion. <p> According to one senior PLO official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a people " had he supported the Cairo summit resolutions. " It was difficult, " says the official, who was with Arafat at the time. " Yet if we did not heed the Palestinian popular support for Iraq, we could have lost everything. " <p> " At the beginning of the intifadah( uprising), most Palestinians believed that it was the beginning of the end of the Israeli occupation, " says a Palestinian from the occupied town of Beit Sahour. " But after three years, nothing on the ground has changed and people are desperate. " <p> The PLO 's diplomatic breakthroughs with Western nations appear practically meaningless to many Palestinians, who see no signs of an Israeli withdrawal. They point to the lack of results from the US-PLO dialogue in Tunis, which began in 1988 but which the US ended recently after a Palestinian group launched an unsuccessful attack at an Israeli beach. <p> " It was never a real dialogue, it was a one-sided conversation where the Americans kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Yasser Abed Rabo, who led the Palestinian delegation to the talks. <p> Saddam 's warning to " wipe out half of Israel " if the latter attacked Iraq, strongly appealed to Palestinians, who feel they have lost important support from Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. They are especially upset about the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel. <p> The same concerns prompted Arafat to join Iraq during an Arab summit in Baghdad last May in demanding, against Saudi and Kuwaiti opposition, that oil be used to step up the pressure on Washington to reconsider its position on the Palestinian question. <p> A senior PLO source says the organization was also upset with the Saudis and Kuwaitis after learning that, despite public and behind-the-scenes pressure by Iraq to increase their aid to the intifadah, the Saudis and Kuwaitis were actually channeling more aide to Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist movement. Hamas is competing with the PLO for the allegiance of Palestinians in the occupied territories. <p> Arafat hoped that the PLO alliance with Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another PLO official. This official says Arafat did not intend to provoke a confrontation with the US. <p> PLO officials say wealthy Palestinians in the Gulf are pressuring Arafat to distance himself from Iraq. But given the support for Iraq in the occupied territories and Jordan, he is unlikely to do so. <p> " He was caught up with the Iraqi action and the overwhelming Palestinian support for Iraq - and there is very little margin left for maneuver, " says a Palestinian academic, who is a member of the Palestine National Council. <p> In addition to statements supporting Iraq by the Unified Command of the intifadah in the occupied territories, all the Damascus-based Palestinian opposition factions have called for a confrontation with the US and support of Iraq. In doing so, they have publicly defied Syria, which has sent troops to Saudi Arabia. <p> Palestinian sources in Tunis over the weekend leaked a report that the PLO had launched a peace initiative which would involve a simultaneous Iraq and US troop withdrawal from Kuwait and Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the organization is keen on confining the conflict to the Arab world, they are aware that the PLO is an unacceptable mediator as far as the US is concerned. <p> Furthermore, some Palestinian officials warn that the PLO should not jeopardize its popular support by appearing to take a neutral position on the US military presence. " Many people fear that the PLO still harbors illusions about Washington and would not take a firm stand, " says a Palestinian activist, reflecting the militant mood in Jordan. <p> PLO officials expect Egyptian pressure to mount on Arafat, and believe Cairo or Tel Aviv may try to find an alternative Palestinian leadership. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Monday that Arafat has " lost credibility, " and the Egyptian press has continued to attack the PLO leader. <p> " This is sheer blackmail that Arafat should not succumb to, " says a senior PLO official in Amman.
