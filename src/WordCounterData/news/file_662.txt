Fred Squillante/Dispatch <p> The Rev. Lloyd Craycroft motioned to the white brick facade of Victory Ministries ' Center of Hope in Whitehall, saying it represents a blank canvas. <p> He offered the metaphor to a crowd gathered Tuesday for the grand opening of the new social-services hub. <p> " We just believe we can go in so many directions now, " said Craycroft, Victory Ministries ' executive director. " We get a new ministry idea every day. It just is an endless list of people we can help with a high impact. " <p> The site replaces Victory Ministries ' 5,000-square-foot center that operated on Switzer Avenue on the East Side. Last year, the Christian-based ministry founded in 1983 helped 20,000 people from 52 ZIP codes. <p> Loretta Doyle of the Northeast Side is among the volunteers, serving as a literacy tutor and in the clothing shop and food pantry. <p> She discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a tough time herself. She had been laid off from her job as an instructional assistant and substitute teacher and was working on her bachelor 's degree. Not long after that, her mother fell ill, and then she did. <p> She was praying in the chapel area at the Switzer Avenue site when she was overcome by tears. A counselor asked " Would you like to talk? " <p> That compassion set Victory Ministries apart from another food pantry, where she stood in line to get a bag of items and no one asked who she was. <p> " It means a lot when people believe in you. I was encouraged, " said Doyle, 58, who now has a bachelor 's degree in special education and a master 's degree in literacy. " When you have people behind you, it makes you feel like you can do anything. " <p> Victory Ministries purchased its new site, formerly a shopping center, in 2013 and began a $1.5 million campaign for renovation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services renovated the 1979 building, and volunteers from 20 churches chipped in. <p> Craycroft said the location was chosen because the area was a " service desert.
