5017741 <h> Letter : Clean house now, not later <p> I believe it 's absolutely necessary that everyone read the Mueller report and/or watch the most important parts of last week 's televised hearings. There can be no doubt as to the conclusions drawn. <p> First, that the United States was massively attacked via cyber/media warfare by the government of Russia. And they continue to attack our political system and our way of life. Second, immediate and significant action must be taken to root out this insidious virus. I would consider much stronger actions against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the GRU and the Russian government. <p> Lastly, the American public must hold our House of Representatives and Senate responsible for ending this president 's reign of lies, personal greed, abuse of power, of sleeping with the enemy and the attempt to co-opt this country 's freedoms and our rule of law. This must be done by impeachment, as well as indictments after he is removed from office. If we do n't clean house now, then when?
