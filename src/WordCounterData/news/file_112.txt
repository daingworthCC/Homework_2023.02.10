3022341 <p> Following are excerpts of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 's speech Monday to the Congress of Peoples ' Deputies, translated from Russian by The Associated Press : <p> Comrade Deputies. The present situation in the country is difficult. The crisis is growing in the economy, in social and political spheres, and especially in inter-ethnic relations.... Dissatisfaction is growing with the actions of central republican and local organs of power, especially actions of executive organs. <p> Even in the course of perestroika, serious errors and miscalculations have been made by the leadership. We underestimated the depth of the crisis in the society.... But we can not give way to panic. We must not succumb to the pressure of the present difficulties. And most importantly, we must act to remove the most serious dangers and use all opportunities opened by perestroika.... <p> We have destroyed the foundations of the totalitarian administrative command system which chained our society for decades.... We have started to transform property relations to create incentives for the individual, to make him the owner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and to liberate his initiative.... <p> Our foreign policies have had a decisive contribution in a healthier international atmosphere. Together with other states, we have removed the danger of a global nuclear war. Our soldiers have returned from Afghanistan, and I am sure that nothing like that will ever be repeated.... <p> The only reasonable policies now will consist of joint efforts to stop the deepening of the crisis and overcome our weaknesses and negative tendencies that have become apparent in our society. And within a year or year and a half, to bring our country onto the broad road of normal, healthy development toward renewal.... <p> If we have firm power, discipline, and control over the execution of decisions, we 'll be able to set normal food supplies, rope in criminals, and stop inter-ethnic hostilities.... If we can not achieve it, discord will inevitably grow, and evil forces will rage, and the state will crumble.... <p> The Communist Party is a natural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public forces will make it possible to achieve the ultimate goal of perestroika : The renewal of our society in the framework of socialist choice, on the way to a movement toward humane and democratic socialism.... <p> Under the new system, the president, who is the head of state, will directly guide the Cabinet of Ministers, unite and coordinate the activities of all supreme organs of union power and government.... And it is important that a vice president should be working alongside the president, with permanent functions of his own, who would at the same time fulfill specific tasks put forward by the president.... <p> The Council of the Federation, as part of the presidential power, will also have a new role. This is related to the transformation of our state into a union of sovereign republics.... <p> The sovereignty of the republics is a historically irreversible stage in the development of our country. But while drawing away from overcentralization, we must not allow for the union to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviolability of the principle that each nation has the right to self-determination. But it is the precisely the nation as a whole that has this right. <p> The best form for expressing the will of the nation is a referendum. And I 'm making a proposal for the Congress ' consideration to hold a referendum in the entire country so that each citizen should express him or herself in favor or against of Union of Sovereign States on the basis of a federation. <p> The results of the referendum in each republic would be become the final verdict. As for secession from the union, it can only be carried out on the basis of the appropriate law with due regard to all aspects of this complex political and socio-economic process.... <p> We have come across a situation where republics and other national and territorial entities adopt changes in their legal status, ignoring the acting constitution of the U.S.S.R. This guerrilla-type approach can lead to serious disorders and simple chaos. This is a road to nowhere.... So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state firmly that until the Union Treaty is signed... that the constitution remains the supreme legislative statute.... <p> We particularly need strong power to launch a decisive offensive against crime, to deliver a merciless blow against bandits, economic sabotage, bribery, profiteering, thievery and hooliganism.... Special structures to fight organized crime are being established under the president.... <p> The armed forces are responsible for the defense of our state. The army is the main foundation of state sovereignty, its internal and external stability.... <p> I think that this Congress should decisively condemn slurs against our armed forces and discrimination against them.... I want to stress that the problems of the armed forces will be a priority of the presidential power and its organs.... <p> The utmost priority to be tackled immediately by the presidency and its organs is the food problem. What is happening now is not simply a shortage of food. It is a consequence of disorder, lack of control, criminal negligence. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions, of economic ties and normal relations between the city and countryside.... <p> I want to reaffirm that we are capable of ensuring in 1991, on the basis of domestic production and purchases from abroad, a per capita consumption not lower than this year 's level. But we need to bring order the consumption of food resources, I mean gathering, transportation, preservation, processing, and above all, distribution and trade.... <p> Considering the experience this year and disruption of deliveries to industrial centers, I have proposed that republics should sign an agreement for 1991 on the issues of food supplies.... This agreement must be signed while the Congress is in session.... <p> Nineteen ninety-one should be a turning point in reforming land ownership relations. I propose that this Congress adopt a special resolution stating that, starting Jan. 1, farmers and all individuals should be allowed to lease, without any obstacles, land to use during their lifetime and with the right to pass on to their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local organs give additional land to current owners of small private plots who want it.... Five million hectares( 12,350,000 acres) will be needed for this.... <p> I have given instructions to draft a temporary agreement between republics on economic issues for 1991. The draft has been considered in all republics, and we have their remarks. It will be redrafted and signed. This will remove obstacles to normal functioning of the state during the period of transition to the market.... <p> The priority issue now in the country is to normalize the monetary system and reduce the state budget deficit. For that purpose the following measures will be taken : A sharp decrease in capital investment in industry ; freezing of unfinished construction and selling off uncompleted facilities ; concentrating finances and resources on those facilities that are nearly completed ; sharp decreases in subsidies to money-losing enterprises ; cuts in expenditures for administration and management ; requiring more enterprises to be self-sufficient ; cuts in military expenditure ; end to issuing money to cover the budget deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major consumer items, apartments and construction materials.... <p> Starting Jan. 1... the state bank will be taken out of the executive organs. At the same time, a large number of joint-stock and cooperative banks will be formed and other non-state banks will be formed. <p> Denationalization must not be reduced to a change of labels or to transferring enterprises from the union to the republics, because it will lead to a change from the dictate of union ministries to an equally tough dictate of republics ministries.... I have given instructions for a draft on denationalization and demonopolization programs to be prepared. It must be discussed and considered most carefully, but by society at large and the organs of legislative power, and adopted only after that. <p> Our investment policies will focus on the development of high-tech and low-waste industries. Military conversion will play a major role. It will consist of modernization of the entire machine-building complex in cooperation with foreign partners.... <p> We have given up state monopoly on foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international market, given up ideology-ridden approaches which used to lead to waste of resources in relations with some countries.... <p> Nineteen ninety-one is going to be our most difficult year. The high-point of servicing our foreign loans will be in 1991. In 1992, the payments will decrease by 50 percent. Negotiations have been held with leaders of some countries on opening credit.... But everyone realizes that however important foreign aid may be, the credit itself wo n't solve our problems. We must count on our forces and organization and determination in transition to the market, as well as the toughest austerity regime.... <p> Prices will be regulated by supply and demand eventually, but this can not be done overnight. In our imbalanced market, uncontrolled price growth would have a severe impact on the living standards of many people.... <p> I am giving all appropriate due to the tremendous input made by intellectuals working in the arts, science and technology.... At the same time, I must say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting out our relationship with the past and relations among other intellectuals. Those people render poor service to society, and are accustomed to inciting destructive passions, destabilizing public consciousness.... <p> Now, more than ever we need discipline and self-discipline, civil conciliation, hard and selfless labor, and confidence in our own forces. We must not give up ourselves or frighten people with a looming catastrophe. The entire society, all work collectives and every individual, must proceed from words to deeds and decisively move forward.
