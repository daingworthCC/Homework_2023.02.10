4022541 If anything, the NFL scouting combine has evolved into a multi-media explosion of information and personalities. The future NFL stars doing bench presses are only part of it. The teams also embrace opportunities here to put on the best face they can for their franchises. // There are prominent national writers and NFL Network cameras at their disposal and the public-relations payback can be immense. Teams that are proud of the way they do their business want you to know it. // At the combine, there is no game-day pressure. This is when you see NFL people in their most honest, relaxed, open light. They enjoy the interaction with media folks they know and respect, and the feeling is mutual. // At regular intervals the past few days, numerous head coaches and high-ranking club officials from most teams have made strategic stops at the interview podium in the media room. // They do it gladly. Tom Coughlin from the Super Bowl champion New York Giants did the interviews, as did his impressive young general manger, Jerry Reese. // On the flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta Falcons, Mike Smith, spoke on Saturday. He was the defensive coordinator in Jacksonville when Michael Vick 's dog-fighting practically destroyed Smith 's new team. When Bobby Petrino ducked out to go to Arkansas. // He has inherited a team that just had its elite cornerback and best athlete, DeAngelo Hall, stand outside the interview room on Friday demanding a trade. // If anyone had a reason to duck out, it 's this man. But for anyone who doubted that the dark horse candidate for the Falcons ' gig was right for the job, that disappeared once he began speaking enthusiastically about his plans for the team. // Smith said it 's important to do this interview at the combine. // " It 's about accountability, " he explained. " And I 'm excited about where we 're going to be headed. " // Who has n't talked and wo n't? Bill Parcells from the Dolphins. Why? // Because he 's Parcells and he does n't have to. // Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why? // Because he does n't want to. // In fact, if you want to actually see the Raiders ' young head coach at the scouting combine, it has been suggested that a check of the crawl spaces above the Indianapolis Convention Center that lead to the RCA Dome would be in order. // Because Kiffin has been MIA. // " Have you see him yet? I have n't, " one NFL coach asked, amused, as I kept up Lane Patrol in the teeming hallway between the huge interview room and the entrance to the dome for workouts. // I mean, heck, a sighting would have been great. A few words would have been bonus. // " You wo n't see him out here in public, " another head coach told me. // Unfortunately, Kiffin 's awkward relationship with owner Al Davis - who is 100 percent in charge of the Raiders ' business at this combine even though he is n't physically here, assistant coaches tell me - is public knowledge. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indianapolis ; he arrived Friday evening. He has attended one team personnel meeting. That much is known. // What makes this interesting - and extremely noticeable - is that Raiders assistants have been highly visible. They get pats on the back from other coaches and NFL colleagues. They 're engaging, smart, respected football people and this is the place - the one place every year - where NFL coaches and officials get together at work and after work for camaraderie, some brotherhood. // Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan and linebackers coach Tom Martindale have been out there among the crowds. So has offensive line coach Tom Cable. These guys are veterans who know how to represent the Raiders ' organization well. // " I 'm not satisfied with how our defense played last season and it 's going to get better, I promise you, " Ryan said. That was on the record, folks. // " I 'm proud of my organization and what we can get done, " said Martindale, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his tutelage who will improve this season. " I wish Mr. Davis were here today, because he loves the combine. But trust me - he 's on top of it. " // These guys make you believe. // Too bad Kiffin does n't appreciate the opportunity he 's letting slip here. A simple five- or 10-minute interview appearance - he could couch some answers if the questions were too sensitive - could do wonders to bolster his image and that of the organization. It would lift the spirits of Raiders fans who have heard nothing but negativity since the season ended. // Oh well. Maybe next year, coach. Or maybe not. // Rifling through the notebook while watching 340-pound offensive linemen try to bend at the waist to run a 40-yard dash... // Hustle award : You 've got to love the dedication and work ethic of sports agent Jason Dillard of Sacramento, who stood in the busy hallway in front of the RCA Dome handing out flyers and T-shirts emblazoned with " MISSING : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - UNLV ; Damon Jenkins - Fresno St. ; Clifton Smith - Fresno St. " // The shirts have their pictures, stats and superlatives on the back. // " I 'm there for my clients. They should have been invited here, and I want everyone to know about them, " Dillard said. // He 's got a point. Jenkins is a De La Salle product who had a 56-yard interception return for a touchdown against Boise St. in 2006. Lewis transferred from San Jose State, started 25 consecutive Pac 10 games and became a team captain for the Huskies. Smith was a premier punt returner in the WAC. James is a solid free safety. // Jenkins and Smith 's Pro Day is at Fresno State on March 12. Best of luck to you, guys. And you, Dillard. // Extra points : Cal wide receiver DeSean Jackson surprised the scouts by weighing in at a scant 169 pounds, undersized for even his smaller 5-foot-9 3/4 stature. That means the pressure is on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... USC quarterback Josh Booty 's hand size was measured at size 8 - Smith, who gained infamy for his small hands at the 2005 combine. //
