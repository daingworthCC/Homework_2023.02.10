3027141 <p> Most teen-agers do not look to Melrose Place, Pearl Jam or even Mother Teresa for inspiration. Nor do they care whether basketball 's Charles Barkley wants to be their role model. <p> In fact, more than half do n't have any role model at all, says a Gallup poll commissioned by USA TODAY and CNN. <p> Fifty-one percent of 803 teens ages 13-17 nationwide do n't have someone they admire and want to be like, the Gallup poll shows. <p> And that fact just boggles the mind of Alex Bass, 14, Raleigh, N.C. " They ca n't identify anyone who influenced them? If they honestly ca n't, that is pathetic. Having a role model enables you to set goals, gives you a source of inspiration. " <p> As for him, " My dad is the most significant male in my life. He grew up poor, the youngest of eight on a farm, and he went on to get a college degree. " <p> Bass and the 14 other members of USA TODAY 's new Teen Panel can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group, chosen from 514 applicants, has had a luckier roll of the dice than many, experts say. <p> The lack of role models reflects " the plight of lots of American youths today, " says child and adolescent psychiatrist Henry J. Gault, Northbrook, Ill. " Many think about carrying a gun for protection. They are frightened, disenchanted, having a hard time finding somebody to idealize. " <p> In a 1987 poll of 1,006 adults, 58% said they had had a role model in childhood. Psychiatrist Frank Pittman is concerned to see the numbers falling. Increasingly, boys without heroes take their cues from pop culture, says Pittman, author of Man Enough( Putnam, $ 22.95). " They get their notions of what a boy has to do to become a man from horrifying, violent stuff that says manhood is a form of degrading others. " <p> Our new panelists have no such trouble. Jim Strouse, 16, Goshen, Ind., cites three role models. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being one of the greatest basketball players of all time. And I really respect him speaking out about AIDS, " Strouse says. Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead " has stopped taking drugs and gotten healthy lately. " And Strouse 's eighth- grade science teacher was " the first one to motivate me to think. " <p> New York Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly and a local TV anchorman are role models for Daniel Polinsky, 15, Greensboro, N.C. " Mattingly started at the bottom and worked to the top ; the anchorman is from a broken home and did the same thing. " <p> Having such folks to look up to is essential to negotiating the roadblocks of adolescence, psychiatrist Gault says. " It is very important the child have someone to imitate, idolize, someone who gives him strength and motivation. And it is critically important in helping him sustain himself, move on through life. " <p> Reynaldo Nicholas Martinez, 16, El Paso, says his first-grade teacher is the one. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set me on a good track. I still visit her. " <p> Evelin Nagy, 16, Encinitas, Calif., points to her dad, who died several years ago. " My mother worked, and my father had his own business. He was the one who picked me up at school. And he brought me up to believe girls should have the same opportunities as boys. " <p> Strouse cites teens ' ubiquitous role model : each other. " Really, your peers shape you more than anybody else. They 're the No. 1 influence on me. " <p> At the other end of the spectrum are role models who are virtually national heroes. Such figures are " distant, idolized role models - the actors, political heroes, the Michael Jordans, " Gault says. " They can be helpful to kids because these figures usually came from no place - and they have made it. " <p> Brad Dicken, 17, Westlake, Ohio, chooses such folk. " I admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not FDR. I 'm a Republican. " <p> Such hero types have some combination of six attributes, says Frank Farley, president of the American Psychological Association : <p> - Courage and strength. " They must be exceptional. " <p> - Kindness, generosity. " They ca n't be mean-minded and be heroes for long. " <p> - Expertise, intelligence. " They must be good at something. " <p> - Honesty. " Many fall down here ; they lie to their fans. " <p> - Ability to inspire affection. " They must make you feel good about them. " <p> - Adventuresome spirit. " They must be risk-takers, be able to push the envelope. " <p> - In the USA TODAY poll, 8% of those claiming a role model chose an entertainer ; 21%, a sports figure. Our panelists endorse athletes, but with reservations. <p> - Dicken : " We worship athletes today, and they are not heroes. They are not the same as Hank Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> - Colin Morris, 15, Syracuse, N.Y. : " Bo Jackson running for a touchdown is a good role model. But just because some athlete wears Nikes in a commercial does n't mean you really know something about him. " <p> - Liz Paulus, 14, Scottsdale, Ariz. : " I watch Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and I want to imitate their form when I run track. But that does n't mean I want to imitate how they conduct their lives. " <p> But it is real-life heroes that appeal most to both panelists and teens nationally. Fifty-four percent of those in the poll who mentioned a role model chose relatives. " Parents are the No. 1 role model in America today - hands down, " Farley notes. <p> And parents, coaches and teachers are the most significant role models for kids, Gault says. " These are real people, visible to kids on a day-to-day basis. Stars and athletes have an unreal quality. " The famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash. " I 'd love to have that kind of lifestyle, but it is n't real. And all the stuff the stars go through - I would n't want it. " <p> Many panelists choose mom and pop to admire instead. <p> - James Brewster, 17, Albuquerque : " Stars and sports figures are not role models to me. You should look up to your parents - they are the ones who will always want the best for you. " <p> - Rachel Hegburg, 15, Exeter, R.I. : " I think athletes are good role models, especially Magic Johnson, who has really tried to help others. But it 's Mom and Dad who are always there for me. " <p> - Emalie Huriaux, 15, San Ramon, Calif. : " My mother lived in a teeny, tiny town in Pennsylvania, and lived so poor. But she made the best of it and moved on, graduated from college, got a better life. I just think that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha : " My dad is most influential in my life. I have many of his mannerisms, speech patterns, vocabulary. I have his same outlook. " <p> - Amy Frost, 14, Laramie, Wyo. : " I really respect both my parents. They have strong beliefs, morals and stuff, and they are really successful. " <p> - Gena Ward, 16, Atlanta : " My mother has managed to raise two children all by herself and provide for us in an incredible way. And when I think of her income! I really, really respect her. " <p> Such comments make Alex Bass happier. " If you do n't have a role model - now that is just sad. "
