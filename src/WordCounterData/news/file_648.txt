Photo by Stacie Scott, The Gazette <p> Air Force accomplished more Saturday that simply putting itself in the driver 's seat for the Commander-in-Chief 's trophy, giving it bragging rights over a rival, or sending most of the 43,063 at Falcon Stadium home happy. <p> In beating Navy 28-14 and limiting the Midshipmen to 57 rushing yards, the Falcons forged an identity that is hard to come by -- that of a team that is dominant against the run. <h> Related : <p> Navy quarterback Will Worth gets tackled by Air Force linebacker Jacob Onyechi during the Air Force Falcons and Navy Midshipmen football game at Falcon Stadium on Saturday, October 1, 2016. Photo by Stacie Scott, The Gazette <p> What, you expected a juicier sound bite after a full-on smackdown of an archnemesis? That would miss the point. What has Air Force( 4-0) unbeaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided plenty of that in the second half -- but the down-after-down consistency to swallow up ball carriers. <p> No Navy running back had a run longer than 8 yards. The longest ground gain came on a 13-yard scramble from quarterback Will Worth, who was sacked six times. It 's not that Navy did n't try, repeatedly, to establish the run, carrying 38 times. It just did n't happen and as a result the first meeting in this series of unbeaten teams tilted heavily toward the home team. <p> It was the lowest rushing output for the Midshipmen since 2002, and their lowest against Air Force since 1994. <p> Air Force quarterback Nate Romine makes a pass during the Air Force Falcons and Navy Midshipmen football game at Falcon Stadium on Saturday, October 1, 2016.

But that reality was n't lost on those who understood what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and beat us, " Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. " You have to give Air Force all the credit. I 'm not going to take anything away from them. We had a hard time moving the ball. They really shut down our running game. " <p> Navy( 3-1) returned the favor in a first half largely dominated by defense, and Air Force led 3-0 at the break thanks only to a Brodie Hicks blocked punt that set up a field goal from Luke Strebel -- who made two kicks in the game and owns a national-best streak of 17 in a row. <p> But Navy could n't keep pace in the second half. <p> " A guy named Jalen Robinette came up for us, " Air Force quarterback Nate Romine said. <p> Air Force defensive back Weston Steelhammer is congratulated for his interception during the Air Force Falcons and Navy Midshipmen football game at Falcon Stadium on Saturday, October 1, 2016. Photo by Stacie Scott, The Gazette <p> Romine and Robinette connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half, setting the stage for a 1-yard Tim McVey touchdown. <p> After Weston Steelhammer returned from the locker room from a first-half suspension for targeting in the previous game and grabbed an immediate interception, Romine and Robinette immediately hooked up for another long pass, this time a 75-yard touchdown in which Robinette hit the brakes to let three defenders slide past him. <p> " I kind of just felt a lot of guys around me and I kind of reacted, " said Robinette, who caught five passes for 163 yards and a score. " That 's about it. " <p> Air Force hit one more big play through the air -- a 62-yard touchdown to McVey on a did-you-just-see-that one-handed catch. But it was able to supplement those plays with 173 rushing yards on 53 carries. <p> Air Force led 20-0 before the Midshipmen scored in the fourth quarter. <p> Navy hit some big passes, with Worth finishing 17 of 30 for 260 yards and two interceptions -- both by Steelhammer. But the Midshipmen never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season, no one has against the Falcons. Air Force has given up just 53 yards per game on the ground. That number ranked second in the nation before Saturday but lacked a little luster when it was built on wins against Abilene Christian and pass-heavy Georgia State. But now that Navy is included in the group, there 's undeniable legitimacy to it. <p> " Really impressive to be able to do that, " Falcons coach Troy Calhoun said. " What is neat about this group is they are a very workmanlike crew.... Defensively, to play the run like that was a good achievement. " <p> It was more than that. But in this case the understated tone fits. <p> Your browser does not support IFrame Embeds, please update your browser to view this gallery
