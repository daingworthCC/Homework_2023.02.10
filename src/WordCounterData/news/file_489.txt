4087141 When Jimmy Keene was a teenager, he wanted to play in the NFL. If he did n't make it, he told his dad, he 'd settle for Hollywood. # Neither happened. But with a cocaine empire stretching from his Kankakee home to the South Side of Chicago, he was soon making too much money to care. Then he was locked up, and it seemed too late. # Now, at age 46, he 's almost there. A book telling his life story comes out today, and an Oscar-winning screenwriter is adapting it. # It was n't the cliched lifestyle of a 1980s cocaine kingpin that attracted Paramount to secure the rights -- though Keene had that life, complete with the mansion, the Corvettes, the women and the circle of rich friends. # It was the incredible deal federal prosecutors offered him that gave him a shot at redemption, and has stars including Brad Pitt lining up to play him on screen. # Let us transfer you to the highest security psychiatric hospital in the nation, they told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell us where he buried the bodies. Succeed and we 'll release you. Fail and you might die. Nobody -- not even prison staff -- will know of your mission. # " Even while it was happening, it felt like a movie, " he told his brother when it was all finally over. # COCAINE KINGPIN # " I guess I did get in the back door in the end, " Keene said, laughing, during a recent interview with the Chicago Sun-Times. Now living in Oak Brook, he 's been plotting to sell his story for a decade and is jittery how he 'll look. # " I wish there was another word for drug dealer, " he laments. " It sounds so harsh. " # Keene still has the footballer 's build that helped him lead Eastridge High School to a state championship game as a running back. He would rather focus on a " fallen hero, ' and not what the blurb on his book, In With The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # The son of " the toughest, most feared cop in town, " he relied on his sporting ability to fit in with a wealthy crowd, he said. Dealing drugs kept him popular. # By the time he was 20, he was buying from a Mexican cartel, supplying Cicero mobsters and raking in more than $1 million a year, according to Hillel Levin, who co-wrote Keene 's book. His customers included John Cappas, the brash Southwest Side dealer who infuriated the FBI by taking a leggy female reporter and her camera crew out on Lake Michigan in his speedboat before turning himself in. # But as fast as Keene made money, the legitimate businesses he helped his father set up lost it. By the time federal agents busted through his front door in 1996, he 'd been dealing for 15 years. # The 10-year sentence hit Keene hard. Worse was the effect on his father, who suffered a stroke. # Keene 's best hope once he got out was the job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellmate at Milan Correctional Center, outfit leader Frank Calabrese Sr. # Then, 10 months in, he met with the prosector who 'd convicted him, Lawrence Beaumont. # " He threw this manila folder on the table, " Keene said. " I flipped it open and all of a sudden there 's a picture of a dead girl, and then another. " The pictures of the bodies were followed by a series of yearbook photos of smiling girls. # " All through my trial, they never got me to crack, and I thought, now they 're gon na say they can tie me to a murder conspiracy, " Keene said. " I thought it was a trick to get me to give up the mafia people, the cartel people, possibly my dad. " # Beaumont instead explained that another defendant he 'd prosecuted, a Civil War buff called Larry Hall, had been convicted of killing one of the girls, Jessica Roach, but was suspected of killing as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum security psychiatric prison hospital in Springfield, Mo., but was appealing and could walk free, Beaumont said. If Keene could win new evidence against Hall, Beaumont would ask a judge to release Keene. # " I was n't sure I could do it, " Keene said. " I 'm not a serial killer hunter. If someone said to you, go to a prison undercover where anyone could kill you at any moment, pretend to be someone else and get inside this serial killer 's head, what would you think? " # But Beaumont told Keene he " had social skills that could take me from the street to the board room, " Keene said. # He spent months secretly studying Hall 's file at night while he waited to be transferred, reading by the " itty-bitty bit of light that came through the bars. " # UNDERCOVER MISSION # To avoid suspicion, Keene 's FBI handlers urged him to avoid Hall for six months. But an hour after arriving in Springfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided to " wing it. " # Resisting the temptation to beat a confession out of Hall, he blurted, " I 'm new around here, do you know where the library is? " Keene said. " He told me and I said, ' Thanks I appreciate that from a cool guy like you, and he bugged his eyes out like Charlie Manson and said, ' You think I 'm cool? " # By luck or instinct, Keene stumbled on a winning approach. Hall, a misfit who 'd grown up in a cemetery, wore odd muttonchop sideburns and had no luck with women, was unpopular even in prison. " I was a better looking, cooler version of his big brother, " Keene said. # Soon there was another problem. New York mob boss Vincente " The Chin ' Gigante warned Keene to stop hanging around Hall and his circle of ' Baby Killer buddies. # " I had to have a different face for Larry, for the guards, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said. # And Hall proved tough to crack. For months he claimed he 'd been convicted of selling guns, not murder. Telling Hall his mother read about the Jessica Roach case in the paper got Keene past that block. Sticking up for Hall in fights and sympathizing with his misogyny cemented the bond. # Four months after Keene arrived in Springfield, Hall finally confessed how he found Roach at the side of a road, knocked her out with a rag soaked in starter fluid, then " blacked out " and raped her in the back of his van, before strangling her with a belt. # A couple of days later, Hall explained how he killed a second girl, Tricia Reitler, after she rejected his sexual advances. Again he claimed he 'd blacked out while he raped and killed her. # " He told me he would be hovering over the top of them watching himself do it and then he 'd wake up next to them and they 'd be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with him alone and he starts going into deep bizarre details, there 's no question -- he 's a killer. " # The final breakthrough came when Keene snuck into the prison woodshop and found Hall. # " He had this map of Illinois and Indiana laid out with little red dots on it and 10 or 12 of these little wooden statues of falcons that he 'd made exactly alike, " Keene said. " As soon as he saw me he freaked out and covered up the map. I picked up one of the falcons but he freaked out, saying ' Give me it back! He was holding it like a little baby and he said, ' They watch out for the dead Jim, do you want one? " # " Immediately I realized that 's where all the dead bodies are. " # That night, convinced he at last had enough evidence, Keene marched into Hall 's cell and told him, " I know everything you 've done and I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -. " # It was a critical error. # Keene was woken the next morning by 10 guards and Hall 's furious psychiatrist, who threw him in solitary confinement. # " After a week I started worrying I 'd be trapped forever, " Keene said. " I was all scraggly looking and I was shouting, ' Listen to me, you 're going to think I 'm crazy -- but I 'm working with the FBI! " # Keene 's psychiatrist -- the only person in prison who knew his true mission -- had gone on vacation. By the time he returned, Keene had been in the hole more than a month. # Keene bounced around the system a few more weeks and passed a lie detector test before he was finally released Feb. 24, 1999. # Days later, Hall 's appeal was rejected. Keene would not have to testify, after all. # For prosecutors -- and Keene -- it was a frustrating end. Though Hall will die behind bars, the delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of the map and the falcons, which have not been recovered. Tricia Reitler 's body has not been found and the murders in at least eight other states Hall is suspected of remained unsolved. # " Jimmy was an intelligent kid, " Beaumont -- now a defense attorney -- remembers. " He probably took it a little too far in the end for it all to work out. " # The temptation to add a happier ending to the Hollywood version of Keene 's story will likely be intense. All Keene will say is that a love interest has been added. # His early release allowed him to spend several years with his father, who died of a heart attack in 2004. # He 's now in the property business, living on the income from Paramount, working on other movie deals and is mostly unrepentant about his time dealing drugs, if not the shame he brought on his family. # " I 'm the same character I always was, but my direction in life @
