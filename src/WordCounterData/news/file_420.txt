3071041 <p> Cinco de Mayo incident draws a clash of opinions <p> After hearing the meeting following the Cinco de Mayo disturbance, in particular a gentleman in the audience saying, " We are dying in the streets and going to prison " I became very upset with the " cruisers. " There are choices in life everyone can make. If you do n't want to die in the streets, stay out of them! If you do n't want to go to prison, obey the law! <p> It is n't the community 's responsibility to " entertain " and " give the cruisers something to do. " We are not babysitters! If they want to improve their lives, then they should stay home, do homework, get an education and become assets to the community. They should learn the law, and what it means to obey and respect it. <p> These young people were claiming oppression. As I recall from my studies, the black people brought to America for slavery were not oppressed by whips, chains and brutality. They were oppressed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were denied the right to learn reading, writing and arithmetic, as well as the right to vote. If they were caught in gatherings, learning, they were punished. <p> I do n't see this same oppression in the Hispanic communities of North Denver. They all have the right to a free education, the opportunity to work and the opportunity to become whatever they choose. It is their choice to be what they are. If they do n't want to be a positive part of the community, we should not let them infringe on those who are. <p> I, for one, am glad Butch Montoya took a stand and did n't back down about what really happened. I only wish we had others like Butch Montoya, Debbie Ortega and Ramona Martinez representing the city. Being of Hispanic descent myself, I am proud to see others of the same culture achieve the positions that these people have. <p> PAUL BUSTOS <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> My boyfriend and I walked toward Civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon. As we are arriving, police, almost all of them white, are standing in large groups on street corners. I have the distinct impression that they are thirsty for blood, hoping for an " incident. " Given the authority vested in them, the police define for the crowd an " us " and " them " positioning that no one can miss. <p> Whether or not they are thirsty for blood is irrelevant, because their positioning automatically raises the level of tension in the atmosphere. Why, I wonder, are n't they walking around in the crowds in pairs, protecting people from pickpockets? So I am not surprised, only disgusted, when I open The Denver Post the next day to find that the inevitable has happened. The police have panicked over a gridlock on Federal, donned riot gear and broken up the party. <p> I think to myself that such a gridlock happens every Saturday night on Hollywood Avenue in Los Angeles, and no one panics ; perhaps the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't plan to get caught in it, because it gets boring after a while unless you have some interesting music on. Hard to believe that there was no one in authority with any creative ideas other than reinforcing the power of brute force. It appears that fear was the motivating force, and no one is more dangerous than a scared man with a gun. <p> What could be different next time? Dialogues between police and Cinco de Mayo planners should take place in the weeks beforehand. Police could be encouraged to wear sombreros as an indication that they are culturally sensitive. They could mingle in pairs or groups of three, stopping to chat with individuals as much as possible. Cinco de Mayo planners might encourage people to plan parties at home after the Sunday festivities. A Sunday night curfew might be set for 10 p.m. for anyone under 18. <p> Police should anticipate gridlock next year( for example, they could investigate how it is handled in Hollywood on Saturday nights). If and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared with strategies such as re-routing traffic to other thoroughfares. Both a set curfew and plans on how to deal with gridlock should be announced ahead of time. <p> Negative attitudes toward Mexicans in the United States are gaining momentum. I am constantly reminded of the Armenians in Turkey, of the pogroms in Germany, of Japanese-Americans being led to internment camps during World War II. Walls are being built to keep Mexicans out ; laws are being passed to keep people from speaking Spanish. We need a scapegoat to keep from reminding us that democracy is dead in the United States ; the corpse has transformed into something my white friend calls " corprocracy "( aka " corprocrazy "). <p> Remember the Mexicans when there is no more social aid for the poor and elderly ; no doubt they are next in line. <p> BRENDA M. ROMERO <p> Assistant Professor of Ethnomusicology <p> University of Colorado, Boulder <p> -- -- -- <p> As I watched the fellow on TV scream at Denver police and city council members, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to do about it? " I wondered why they did n't turn the tables on him and ask " What are you doing about it? " <p> And I wondered if next time my teenager does n't need to be in bed by 11 o'clock on a school night, if I might call my city council member or, better yet, make a 911 phone call to the police and demand they find something for my child to do. Do we need to add " entertain teenagers " to police officers ' job descriptions? <p> Because this fellow seems to be at a loss for solutions to a problem American society has had since kids quit doing farm labor and were too tired to do anything but sleep at night, I suggest these alternatives : <p> 1. Teens love to sleep - how ' bout going to bed before midnight on a school night? <p> 2. Athletics - there are a ton of free or inexpensive opportunities for kids to participate in. Instead of cruising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Church activities. <p> 4. Volunteer - help an elderly neighbor clean or shop ; babysit for a parent who needs a break. <p> 5. Read. <p> 6. Listen to music or, better yet, teach yourself how to play an instrument and make your own! <p> 7. Write - poems, music or stories about a holiday that is important to you. <p> 8. Draw. <p> 9. Invite friends over for a personal holiday celebration. <p> 10. Do what probably is at the root of all our need-to-be-entertained problems ; watch TV! <p> And if none of this suits your fancy, there 's always free city council or school board meetings where you can complain about how the government is n't meeting your entertainment needs! <p> SHAWN DEHNE <p> Littleton <p> -- -- -- <p> Low riders are just a microcosm of bigger problems facing Chicanos today. Sunday night 's fruitless attempt by Denver police to put a finger in the dam of low riders was not with public safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As a business owner near West 22nd Avenue and Federal Boulevard, I witnessed young people celebrating who they are Chicano! <p> As any low rider will tell you, they like it low and slow. A relatively safe and slow parade turned into gridlock and chaos after the riot gear and barricades came out. At Tuesday night 's meeting with city and police officials, Federal Boulevard-area residents complained of noise and property damage. It seems curious to me that ball games and concerts at Mile High Stadium,( which was at the center of Sunday 's cruise) Fiddler 's Green and the like are tolerated by police and residents. City council members Debbie Ortega and Butch Montoya called the meeting to " fix " the problem. What must be fixed is the police department 's attitude toward Chicanos and Mexicans. <p> Low riders are low riders and Chicanos are Chicanos, and no laws, riot squads or barricades will change that. I was filled with pride that our Chicano youths so loved who they are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one big spontaneous show of ethnic pride. <p> Absent were gang colors, signs, fights or shootings. Present were Mexican flags, beautiful cars and a raza that wo n't compromise how it celebrates its culture. May God bless our youths for their courage. <p> DAVID SANDOVAL <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> Why are there so few responsible adults in positions of authority - parents, ministers, teachers or lawmakers - telling those young Hispanic " cruisers " on Federal Boulevard that they simply will not be allowed to continue to cause trouble? <p> Hello adults! Where are you? You 're still in charge. You can listen to these kids, but you still get to make the rules. Parents, please get some control over your offspring and instill some positive values in them. Teachers and ministers, are you educating the kids in your charge about not hurting others and protecting the environment? <p> CAROL CARPENTER <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> As I passed The Denver Post ' newspaper box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front page immediately caught my eye. I was pleasantly surprised. How sweet of The Denver Post, I thought, as I purchased a paper. I expected to read a nice peaceful story that would in some way be related to the excellent color photograph of the happy youngsters. But when I unfolded the paper, to the bottom half to my dismay I saw the negative headline, " Officers and revelers collide. " My pleasant thoughts were instantly turned from the positive to the negative. <p> The front page of The Denver Post leaves me with these questions : Why was n't a picture of the incident on Federal Boulevard placed with that story? Why was the picture of the happy youngsters used? And the most important question : Where was the story about the 300,000 proud, happy and peaceful people that attended the Cinco de Mayo celebration, the story that in all fairness belonged on that front page? <p> I see the front page as a direct attack on the integrity of that special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an example of a subtle racism that permeates the core of national and local American journalism. <p> ORLANDO MARTINEZ <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> Chuck Green hit the nail on the head in his May 8 column about the Cinco de Mayo lawlessness. It 's time newspapers and other media stopped making excuses for hooligans and started calling a spade a spade. Words have consequences, and The Denver Post can do an awful lot of good by simply standing up for what 's right. It would n't hurt to give praise where it 's due, as well. How about the cops, who risked their lives once again to handle a dangerous situation without anyone getting hurt? <p> ED CORT <p> Montrose <p> -- -- -- <p> Thank you Chuck Green for hitting the nail on the head in his May 8 column on Hispanic hooligans. How proud can the Hispanic community be of " cruising " youths throwing glass and clogging thoroughfares supposedly in celebration of their cultural heritage? Where were the Hispanic adults who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent their community through their actions? All that we saw on the television news and heard about in the front page story of The Denver Post were irate adults wanting expressions of their cultural pride allowed - no matter what the consequences and no matter how embarrassing the actions. <p> There could n't actually be Hispanic people in this city who felt proud of the actions of those who caused trouble on Federal Boulevard last Sunday night, could there? But we heard them yelling and screaming on Tuesday night - angry at the police for doing their job. If the adults of any ethnic group ca n't control their youths, then somebody has to do it. If the display of Hispanic pride had been orderly on Sunday night, then the police would n't have had to get involved. <p> TIA GRAZIANO <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> I just read Chuck Green 's piece " Hooligans do n't know culture, " where he gave us his ethnocentric view of cruising in the 1950s. <p> Why do adults think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas because in the 1950s America was more rural) back then should hold true today? Why do adults think the rules are the same? They simply are not. For Green to go on about his Longmont buddies and their adult role models simply has no relevance to the Cinco de Mayo celebration and consequent incident. <p> The " idealized " mythical past gave our adult leaders the same headaches as the youths give us today. Except now there are guns and drugs instead of rock ' n ' roll and beatniks to drive the adults crazy. <p> NANCY GILDER <p> Denver <p> -- -- -- <p> Cruising, per se, is not a problem. When I was in high school in small-town Oklahoma, we regularly cruised main street on summer weekend nights. We had fun, saw friends, flirted a little. But we did n't have execrable subwoofer stereo systems that turn ordinary cars into moving seismic events. We did n't carry guns. We did n't throw bottles. We did n't put graffiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after hours in a vacant business district, with no residential housing abutting. We did n't cruise until 3 in the morning, we did n't park in front of houses in the middle of quiet residential streets with our concert level sound systems going at full blast for up to 20 minutes at a time while we argued. <p> We did n't shoot guns in the air, we did n't even throw fireworks( except around the Fourth of July, of course). <p> In other words, our cruising was a pretty reasonable event, and minimal in its impact on anyone else. A constant police presence assured that things stayed under control. <p> We must n't be confused by the smokescreens these clever, media-savvy children will employ. Consistently and methodically, we must send the message that the peace is being disturbed, the party is over, and it is now time to go home. We are expecting continuing action from the police and city to return our neighborhood to the vast majority of law-abiding citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colorado. <p> And we must remember that these " cruisers " are, in the end, simply embarrassing the vast majority of Hispanic citizens that I am proud to call my neighbors. <p> JOHN B. CLARK <p> Denver
