3052341 <p> LOS ANGELES -- Hair grows frizzier in La-La Land. Pants are tighter, men 's ponytails longer, necklines lower. Ears are pierced like pincushions, jeans are ripped at the knee for effect, and folks come and go in great waves. <p> Maybe Andy, the Finnish taxi driver who flies around Santa Monica in an old yellow station wagon, explained Los Angeles as well as anybody could. <p> In Texas, he said, people are real. Problems are concrete. In Los Angeles, he said, folks are more transient. They come looking for an entree into show biz, and when they run out of money and stardust, they leave. " " But still, " Andy said, " " in LA we have fun. We go surfing in the morning and skiing in the afternoon. <p> " " We try anything. " Turning right, away from the awesome California beach and row after row of palm and banana trees, the taxi rolled to a stop at Arizona and 18th streets. The chapel of the Unitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, waiting for New Age preacher Marianne Williamson. <p> For the uninitiated, Williamson is a native Houstonian who is hot news in Los Angeles and New York. <p> She 's just written what promises to be a best-selling book, " " A Return to Love : Reflections on the Principles of A Course in Miracles "( HarperCollins, $ 20), she appears on cable TV on both coasts ; there even are inspirational Williamson tapes. In addition to her teaching and preaching, she has a myriad of projects that help hundreds of critically ill AIDS and cancer patients daily. <p> Those good works take massive infusions of money and volunteers, and stars like Bette Middler, Shirley MacLaine and Cher have helped her find both. Williamson downplays her Hollywood connections, but when Liz Taylor married Larry Fortensky in October, she asked Williamson to perform the ceremony. <p> In a fold-out photo of the Taylor-Fortensky wedding party in People magazine, that 's Williamson, seated, far left. <p> Regardless of their name or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are about to get married, about to die, or just find themselves in a jam somewhere in between. And they come to hear her lectures, where the message, in a word, is love. <p> Williamson says we 've got to shift our thinking, our entire orientation, away from fear to love, which she equates with God. <p> For those who are n't sure they believe in God, no problem, she says, just change words. Love is God, God is love -- to her it 's one and the same. <p> Williamson 's talks, which might range on any given night from relationships to careers to social responsibility to the ozone layer, are inspired by what she calls her own " " issues " and a complex, often murky 1,200-page work called " " A Course in Miracles. " Williamson describes the course as spiritual psychotherapy. <p> Others have called it a thought system. Studying the course, she says, helps people resolve the conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace, as Williamson knows too well, is an elusive goal. <p> " " I 'm a bitch for God -- I 'm tense for the Lord, " she said, mocking herself and her intensity during a Sunday night lecture. <p> Her humor can be brittle, a la Joan Rivers. It can be warm, a la Bill Cosby. She rolls her eyes as she announces she 'll be doing what she calls an " " intensive " on relationships, a workshop, really, in the coming week. <p> " " It 's usually veeerrrrrry intense, " she said. <p> At Williamson 's pulpit-stage, while lecturing to audiences dominated by baby boomers and AIDS sufferers, she seems totally in control. <p> Much has been written about Williamson 's **27;89;TOOLONG clothes, her all-American good looks, a figure that is at once athletic and feminine. She uses her hands as effectively as a boxer and her voice like an instrument. <p> " " Hollywood 's ticket to God, " one reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else described her. Other catchy press labels : " " Mother Teresa of the ' 90s " and " " A prophet for the New Age. " But Williamson has not been flattered. Instead, appearances on talk shows around the country and interviews with prestigious magazines and newspapers have left her a bit raw. <p> In the privacy of her West Hollywood apartment, the 39-year-old is hypercritical of her performances on TV. After reading stories about herself, she agonizes, questioning the balance and use of quotes. <p> " " What I need, " she says wearily, sounding like someone in danger of burnout, " " is a vacation. " She 's a single mom. She 's been working, if not tirelessly, then ceaselessly, for the past eight and a half years. Williamson moved her office home after daughter India Emmaline was born in May 1990, but that 's one of the few concessions to motherhood she 's been able to make. Williamson has had to hire round-the-clock housekeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All those maids, " her mom, Houstonian Sophie Ann Williamson, said regretfully. " " I do n't know how Marianne can stand it. " During interviews, Williamson skips lightly over her past. <p> She 's just a woman, she says, like every other woman. Her childhood, she says, was unremarkable. <p> When nudged to say something about the first 30 years of her life, she proceeds carefully : " " I was born into a middle-class Jewish family. Our Judaism was a part of everyday life in an ethnic sense, and I was taught a very Jewish approach to life. Jews tend to wear their passions on their sleeves. Jews tend to care. Jews tend to go out and get it done, whatever it is. " Williamson was the baby of the family. She has a brother, Peter, an immigration lawyer, and a sister, Jane, who teaches fifth-grade history at St. John 's School. <p> Both live with their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a good place to be from. <p> " " At the time, growing up in Houston was a painful experience, " she said. <p> Williamson 's mom, Sophie Ann, struggles to understand why. <p> Marianne took dance, piano and voice lessons. She was a junior high school cheerleader. During summer vacations, she and her family traveled around the United States, Europe, the Soviet Union, even Vietnam. <p> The trip to Southeast Asia took place shortly after she announced to her dad that if the United States did n't enter the war in Vietnam, Americans would be fighting on the shores of Hawaii. <p> Sam Williamson wanted his children to see the hell war really was. <p> Back home, Williamson excelled in school, became an exceptional debate and drama student and graduated from Bellaire High School close to the top of her class. <p> Socially, she seemed equally adept. She often threw parties ; her mom and dad welcomed her friends into their home. <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exclusive Jewish sorority. More girls were rejected from the group than accepted, but Williamson gained easy admittance. <p> She looks back on that adventure with horror. <p> " " In retrospect, that sorority is appalling to me, " Williamson said. " " The determination was, were you dressed well enough, were you cool enough? Nobody said, " Excuse me, is this healthy? " Sophie Ann Williamson, stay-at-home-mom, devoted volunteer, now proud grandma, cocks her head. Maybe she should have asked. But her memories of Marianne 's childhood are so pleasant. She remembers a daughter who seemed to have things under control, who seemed to need little protecting. <p> Two vivid images stand out. <p> When Marianne was little bitty, her mom would go in at night to tuck her in. Much of the time, however, the child would wave her away. Hands pressed together, mouth open, she would be talking to God. <p> " " She 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there was the night, when Marianne was in high school, that a young man broke into the house and started to attack her in her bed. <p> The teen-ager was overpowered physically, but not mentally. <p> Using only words, she was able to chase him out of her bed, out of her room and out of her house. <p> " " Even then, " her mom remembered, " " she was so levelheaded, so composed. " Wait-listed at Radcliffe College, Williamson attended the less prestigious, less structured Pomona College outside Los Angeles. Maybe she needed more structure, her mom worries today, and maybe she did. Instead of graduating, she quit school to grow vegetables in New Mexico. For the next 10 years, she ricocheted between LA, San Francisco, New York and Houston. <p> Sophie Ann theorizes that her daughter had so many avenues open to her and so many examples to follow that she was overwhelmed -- it became impossible for her to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she is a part of a generation that has taken too long to grow up. " " As a group, " she said, " " we had no rites of initiation( into adulthood). There was Vietnam, but most of us did n't fight that war. " Williamson is not into blaming parents in general or her parents in particular. She does observe, however, that the men and women who survived World War II and went on to have boomers did everything they could to protect their children from life 's uncertainties. <p> It 's possible, she muses, that they did too good a job. <p> " " We were protected from the blows of normal consequences. " Meanwhile, Williamson had what she describes as a nervous breakdown. <p> She writes in her book, " " I knew I had talent, but I did n't know at what. I knew I had intelligence, but I was too frantic to apply it to my own circumstances. I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact. I sank deeper and deeper into my own neurotic patterns, seeking relief in food, drugs, people, or whatever else I could find to distract me from myself... <p> " " There was some huge rock of self-loathing sitting in the middle of my stomach during those years, and it got worse with every phase I went through. " One day in 1977, she saw a set of blue books with gold lettering on a friend 's coffee table in New York City. That was " " A Course in Miracles ", written by psychologist Helen Schucman, who said it was dictated by Jesus Christ. <p> At first, Williamson was turned off by the frequent references to Christ and stymied by the density of the prose. But life was pretty confusing, too. She kept returning to the course. <p> She was an avid student by the time she moved back to Houston in 1979 and opened Heights Book Store. <p> Williamson said she found a changed city. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another way it gained sophistication. I like Houstonians. I 'm a native Houstonian. <p> Houstonians think big. " For a time it seemed that Williamson had found her niche. The bookstore was pure Marianne -- full of works on religion and philosophy and absent of the popular junk novels of the day. " " Let people go to the drugstore if that 's what they want, " she would tell her mom. <p> " " A Course in Miracles " was in good supply. If customers wanted, she would tell them what she had deciphered thus far. <p> During those Houston years, Williamson married, then quickly divorced. Her mom says wryly that the couple split even before she 'd received all the wedding bills. <p> Williamson also made occasional appearances at local nightclubs, perhaps unable or unwilling to give up hopes of a singing career that she had nurtured since high school. <p> " " It was n't a peaceful time, but I learned a lot, " Williamson said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983, thinking she would stick around for " " a long, long time. Then I got a flash that I would n't be there long at all. Then I got an added flash that I was going to LA. <p> " " It surprised me. " She left hurriedly, barely locking the bookstore door behind her. <p> " " What was I going to do in LA? " she asks rhetorically. " " I had no idea. " Before long she was working at the Philosophical Research Society, once a supplier of books for her store, and giving lectures on the course. <p> Before her first lecture, she pasted fliers all over town and attracted an audience of 75. <p> During the next year, the crowds were smaller but faithful. <p> " " About 30 people would come, and I 'd bring ginger ale for everybody, " Williamson said. " " The only difference between then and now -- I wore bigger earrings. " Actually, there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her notoriety. <p> Then most folks had never heard of Williamson. She was not as involved in fund-raising. And she had not yet started the Los Angeles Center for Living, the Manhattan Center for Living or Project Angel Food. <p> Williamson got the idea for the centers from a friend, a cancer patient, who said she had spent years looking for people to help her live. Now, she said, she needed help to die. <p> The Los Angeles center, started in 1987, and the Manhattan center, started in 1989, offer counseling, housekeeping help, even massages to the critically ill. In Los Angeles, Williamson also oversees Project Angel Food, which distributes one healthy, gourmet meal a day to the homebound. Flowers often accompany the trays of food. <p> Counseling jobs keep Williamson running from one end of town to the other, doing work that often goes unpaid. She 's hoping that her book, on store shelves since early February, will provide financial security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been scooped up, it just might. <p> Before the book, Williamson earned the heft of her income from her speaking engagements -- lecturing once a month in New York and two or three times a week in Los Angeles. There, audiences continue to outgrow available spaces in churches and halls. Tickets are $ 7, but the cost is waived if someone ca n't or wo n't pay. <p> " " I do n't know if you noticed, " Williamson said drolly, but a lot of people do n't. <p> Tapes are another source of income. The tapes, like the lectures, are $ 7 a pop, though that charge can be waived, too. <p> The keeper of the tapes is Norma Ferrara, who also is the meeter, the greeter and the seater at Williamson 's Los Angeles lectures. Almost always, the friendly face beneath the broad-brimmed hat can squeeze one more body into a church pew or find one more folding chair. <p> Ferrara lends a family feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she and her spouse are little Emma 's godparents. <p> The toddler is a very secure, much-loved and well-adjusted child, Ferrara pronounces. <p> Even as she approaches 2 and the " " mine " stage, little Emma shares her breakfast, her lunch, even precious toys with her mom 's visitors. If she is lacking a father figure, she suffers no shortage of doting adults. <p> Williamson wo n't talk about Emma 's father. She does allow, however, that she would love to get married to the right person and that raising a child is really a two-person job. <p> But, she said, when she found herself pregnant at 37, " " I had no impulse to do anything other than have the baby. <p> " " The cutest, most divine little angel has come to live at my house, " Williamson said. " " Motherhood is the sweetest thing that can happen to a person. " Fame, Williamson says, has not been nearly so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lectured and pushed her various projects, and she was everybody 's darling. <p> Now everybody 's asking too many prying questions. " " That 's nobody 's business, " she retorts when personal questions hit a nerve. When the queries take a financial tilt, Williamson answers simply and shows folks around her apartment and office across the street. <p> Williamson 's apartment might have been described, at one time, as the perfect single-girl 's retreat. Now living-room accessories include a hot-pink, toddler-sized roadster and a playpen containing a mountain of toys. <p> She 's not rich and not poor, she says, adding that there 's nothing wrong with making money. <p> Those who worry she 's going to profit from other people 's fears, as some other popular preachers have done, might be comforted to talk to her mom. <p> Sophie Ann worries about Marianne 's making her rent and grocery bills. Those who claim that Marianne protests too much about her new-found fame might also consult Sophie Ann. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exhausted from unfair attacks and nervous about the attention. Too many crazies live in California, she says. <p> Even Williamson 's most ardent fans are a little concerned about the media blitz. During the question-and-answer session after a lecture, one woman raised her hand and asked if Williamson will still be accessible to her old friends even after she becomes a celebrity. <p> Williamson said, " " The question is, will you still like me? " There are a few things about Williamson that are crystal-clear -- and clarity is important in the jargon of " " A Course in Miracles ". : <p> The Williamson who is so articulate and self-assured at a podium still can be painfully insecure. <p> Whether " " A Course in Miracles " is a profound guide to living or a bunch of chicken feed, Williamson already has helped more people than most others do in a lifetime. <p> " " It 's gentle work that I do -- and I stand by it, " Williamson said. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith, who has served as a mentor to Williamson and been mentored by her, too, " " is that Marianne is absolutely clear in helping people and seeing a higher truth and helping others to see the truth, too. " Williamson may have inherited her bluntness from her dad. She says affectionately that he is an armchair revolutionary, and she mentions him in the dedication of her book : " " For my Father in Heaven, and my father in Texas. " Sam Williamson, as his children know, is a tough act to follow. He 's in his 80s, but he continues to toil daily as an immigration lawyer. He helps more clients for free than anybody interested in his financial affairs would care to count. <p> " " My mom wages revolution, too, " Williamson has said, " " but with white gloves. Socially, she 's conservative. " Sam and Sophie Ann Williamson are avid supporters of their daughter. They make frequent trips to Los Angeles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row. <p> Only once, Sam pulled his daughter aside and asked, " " Are we talking about the same God? " When Marianne nodded, Sam said, " " OK. <p> I 'm just making sure. Sophie Ann, do n't worry, it 's the same God. " The senior Williamsons have taken their licks from their daughter 's critics, too. In one well-read magazine story, a young man described the Williamson clan as dysfunctional. <p> " " Dysfunctional! " her mom exclaimed in dismay. <p> While Williamson 's notoriety is causing a stir within the family, there 's another, more powerful drama going on. <p> Jane, the middle daughter, the one with the husband, the three children and the teaching career, has breast cancer. <p> Jane will tell anybody who asks that she is doing just fine, thank you very much. It 's a little harder for her mom to be so stoic. <p> Just the mention of Jane 's illness brings tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep, she says, she worries so. <p> Yes, Sophie Ann says when asked, yes, Marianne 's lectures have brought her some comfort. <p> No, says Jane, she ca n't exactly connect with the teachings of the course. <p> But she does n't mean that critically. Clearly, she loves her sister, loves her passion, loves her intensity, loves that sharp mind. <p> " " I find comfort in just talking to Marianne, " Jane said. <p> " " I like the fact that she says things a lot of people only think.
