3048241 <p> THEY PLAY in a city derided as a " mistake on the lake, " and they have inflicted losing seasons on generations of fans. But one season after moving into picturesque new Jacobs Field, they are staging a spirited celebration of the game. <p> The Cleveland Indians are an exclamation point sus- pended midair. They are the buzzing center of excitement that could return baseball to a simpler relationship with its fans. <p> They are the sexiest thing going in a sport worried it no longer has appeal. <p> " These guys do some magic things in this ballpark, " Dave Stewart said Sunday after the Indians completed a four-game sweep of the A 's. They had come from behind to win on a two-out, two-run homer in the 12th inning, and Stewart, the old warrior, was shaking his head in appreciation. <p> " We 're finding out what it was like for other clubs to play us in the late ' 80s. " <p> Those paying attention to baseball after enduring a canceled World Series might recoil at efforts to play up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, denied a run last year at their first World Series appearance since 1954 because of the strike, are having a season that inspires childlike wonder. <p> " This is like a dream, " said Andrea Pacione, a reporter for the local CBS-TV affiliate. " You come to the ballpark and the look you see in people 's eyes, it 's just wonder. You see the father and the son, and the father looks just like the son, reverting to childhood. " <p> Courtney Wilson, 18, was sitting in one of the $ 100,000- a-year, field-level suites next to the Indians ' dugout for the first game at Jacobs Field last season. " It was incredible, " she said. " It was so close and personal. <p> " It got kind of depressing when the team was always losing, but look at us now : We 've got this beautiful stadium and this great team and I could n't be happier for the city. But it kind of p -- me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people start liking a band when they get popular after I 've been liking it for years. It makes me mad. " <p> Renovation has buffed and polished a downtown that until recently reeked of decrepitude and danger. People learning again to gravitate toward downtown hitch onto the group identity a hot Indians team gives them. <p> " Certainly the city hit bottom probably 10 years ago and has had a resurgence, " said Bob Rosewater, an attorney and longtime Indians fan. " You can see it physically downtown, and I think you can see it emotionally in how people feel about the city. " <p> Rosewater saw his first Indians game in 1946. That was at the old League Park, two ballparks ago in the life of the Indians. The Boston Red Sox were in town that day. " I remember my father telling me that Ted Williams was going to hit a home run and he did, " Rosewater said. <p> Like other long-suffering fans, he has spent decades looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record 111 games in the regular season that year but went out in four games to the New York Giants in the World Series. <p> Cleveland 's Vic Wertz went 4 for 5 in Game 1, but his 460-foot drive to center in the eighth inning came down in the glove of Willie Mays, sprinting with his back to home plate to make baseball 's most famous catch. Dusty Rhodes, Mays and Wes Westrum led a Giants offense that steamrolled the Indians, outscoring them, 21-9. <p> " That was the disastrous Series, " Rosewater said. " I attended one of those games. It was probably this baseball-crazy back in ' 54, and it was getting that way last season before the strike. " <p> Victories are the magnet pulling the city together, and the Indians are binging on them. They have the look of a dynasty in the making and the personalities to make it interesting. At the All-Star break they led the league in ERA, batting average and home runs. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-22), and they played with a relaxed intensity that protects a team supercharged on confidence. <p> " They 're just like we were in ' 88 and ' 89, " said A 's radio announcer Bill King. " They know they 're going to win, and you know they 're going to win, too. They just find a way. " <p> The team and their frenzied fans feed off each other. Jacobs Field, the latest in a series of flashy parks easy to shortchange from afar but love from close up, has become the ultimate hot ticket in its second season : They have sold out every game since early June and will sell out every remaining game. <p> The intimate park takes on more charm when the mood of the 42,865 fans idles down a bit. In the syrupy late innings of a tie game, people mill around on the platform deep in center field, overlooking an outdoor food area called the Back Yard. Between them and the center-field grass stretches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backdrop of trees and ivy climbing the walls. <p> Over it all a huge American flag curls and waves and flaps as insistently as a cat 's tail. It starts at a height equal to the ludicrously huge scoreboard in left, 120 feet high by 220 feet wide. <p> Camden Yards has the old warehouse in right, but Jacobs Field takes the link with the past further. Beyond the undulating flag rise a dense cluster of old, brick-and-mortar edifices that conjure the first half of the century and before. <p> Despite the bow to tradition, Jacobs Field has adopted all the tics of **25;742;TOOLONG drop marketing of the ' 90s. The Indians are so entertaining, they are like a great stand-up comedian who has a crowd doubling over with laughter just by taking the stage and standing there. <p> The Indians do n't have to do anything at all to earn standing ovations. But the giant scoreboard insults the acumen of fans with demands to be " LOUDER. " <p> Third baseman Jim Thome, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting, is one of six on the team with more than 40 RBIs. But when he 's up, the scoreboard tries to turn him into Arnold Schwarzenegger, flashing : " THOMENATOR ". <p> But Jacobs Field ranks with the other great new parks in its promise as the ultimate television set : Any playoff series involving this team will be good. Mix in a little extra drama, like like Albert Belle 's ninth-inning grand slam last night or timely theatrics at shortstop by Omar Vizquel, and Cleveland could give baseball something special. <p> " This place is going to be unbelievable, " Stewart said. " It 's going to be a madhouse. If we 're not in it, I might even buy some tickets myself. " <p> Fan enthusiasm can be charming, as when they rise en masse to cheer a nice inning by 40-year-old Dennis Martinez, but the lucky few who get tickets these days can be whiny in the way of along-for-the- ride fans. They groan and hoot over obvious ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an umpire has moments earlier made a whopper of a call tilting toward the home boys. <p> " I 'm really happy they 're drawing 41,000 fans a game, but a lot of those are what we call newfound fans, " said Martin Baker, two-time president of a boosters group called the Wahoo Club. " The true fans, we know the little things that make the game exciting, like whether they 're going to pitch out or what 's a good count to steal on. The new fans do n't know about that at all. " <p> The Indians have their long-denied fans ' hopes -- and the desperate needs of a sport that craves a lift -- hanging in the air, but they 're also playing for their own pride. <p> " It started getting embarrassing losing year after year, it was very embarrassing, " said catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. " There were some days you did n't want to go to the ballpark. You knew that no matter what you did, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now, so you might as well enjoy it. " <p> The team, led by Latin players like no potentially great team before it, also takes pride in what their accomplishments can mean. Alomar, second baseman Carlos Baerga, Ramirez, Martinez, Vizquel, closer Jose Mesa and half a dozen others. <p> " We have all kind of Latin players, we have veteran Latin players, we have young Latin players and we have up-and-coming Latin players, " said Alomar, born in Puerto Rico. " The good thing is if the young ones get out of line, the older guys can get on them. <p> " I do n't only represent Cleveland, I represent myself and my country. I 'm very proud of that. Latin players have this reputation for being lazy and not having good discipline. We know it 's there. So we have to work harder and take care of that image. <p> " It 's been so long for this city. They want it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> A LONG WAIT <p>. <p> Cleveland fans have gone through decades of disappointment with their sports teams. <p>. <p> * INDIANS : Last pennant, 1954. Won World Series, 1948. <p> * BROWNS : Won NFL championship, 1964. <p> * CAVALIERS : Last Eastern Conference finals, 1992( lost to Chicago). <p> * BARONS( AHL and NHL) : Won Calder Cup( AHL), 1964.
