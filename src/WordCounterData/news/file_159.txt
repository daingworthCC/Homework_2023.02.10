3032341 <p> The sudden political prominence of Alberto Fujimori, the man who may deny novelist Mario Vargas Llosa the Peruvian presidency, seems to be a great puzzle to almost everyone except Alberto Fujimori. <p> Months ago, when he was lumped at the bottom of the polls with " others, " Fujimori was telling anyone who would listen that he would be the next president of Peru. The odds seemed so long, his campaign so amateurish and poorly funded, that some people laughed at the idea. No one is laughing now. <p> Associates, political observers and diplomats portray a man who has long wanted to enter politics, who harbors deep ambition beneath a facade of unflappability, and whose views and methods appear to owe much more to pragmatism than ideology. <p> His miracle campaign -- known here as the Fujimori " tsunami, " the Japanese word for tidal wave -- owes much to fortuitous timing and the voters ' rejection of traditional politicians. <p> But the campaign was revolutionary in its use of previously untapped sources of political energy such as small businessmen and evangelical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of Fujimori as a non-threatening outsider who will bring Peru technology and Japanese foreign aid. <p> " Nobody accuses him of being innocent, or sweet, or gentle, " said political columnist and poet Mirko Lauer. " He is ambitious, and he 's not making mistakes. " <p> The campaign did stumble once this week. A press conference to announce Fujimori 's plan for governing the country had to be canceled abruptly when, according to his wife, he came down with food poisoning after eating a bad piece of codfish. Moreover, sources close to the campaign acknowledge that Fujimori is still scrambling to put together a coherent program and a political team to implement it. <p> The delay does not seem to have damaged him greatly. Meanwhile, attacks by Vargas Llosa 's most vocal supporters -- some of them racial -- have backfired. <p> It is difficult to find precedent for what Fujimori and his Cambio 90( Change 90) movement have achieved in so little time. Five weeks before the presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no higher than 3 percent. In the balloting he won about 30 percent of the vote, according to projections, and he is now favored to beat Vargas Llosa in a runoff. In a sense, voters are writing a blank check. Fujimori speaks of concepts, but says little about specific measures he would take. <p> " Our ideology is of the center, " he told interviewers last weekend, proposing " a government that does not control everything... respect, of course with some regulation, for the law of supply and demand, but complemented with some state-owned enterprises. " <p> He says he wants to streamline the government, but he has ruled out privatizing such loss-leading state firms as the government oil, power and telephone companies and the various state mining enterprises. <p> He has said that Peru 's deepening poverty " is a great challenge that no party, not even the government, can resolve alone " and proposes some kind of public-private joint initiative whose details he has not outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes, he says, lies in " reactivation of the productive apparatus " -- especially mining, agriculture, fishing and small industry -- but without the harsh belt-tightening policies, proposed by Vargas Llosa, that might reduce inflation rapidly but could create a recession. " We are against a recession, " he has said. <p> The reactivation he intends, Fujimori has said, will be based on new technologies. " It is our policy to develop local technology, " he said recently, " and defend it... through temporary tariff protection. In our economic conditions, we can not open the economy all at once. " <p> This prescription -- technological advancement without recession, under an umbrella of protection -- strongly appeals to one of the main pillars of Fujimori 's campaign support : the small-scale industrialists and entrepreneurs who form a growing part of Peru 's economy. <p> Scattered throughout Lima 's working-class neighborhoods and its sprawling shantytowns are thousands of these enterprises, miniature factories employing a dozen people producing shoes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens, furniture makers, all kinds in the same block, " said Jorge Figueroa, one of Cambio 90 's congressional candidates. Fujimori speaks to this long-ignored sector, promising credit to help businesses expand and an atmosphere of state support rather than harassment. <p> He also speaks to the army of vendors who ply Lima 's jumbled streets, making up the " informal " economy. Government agents have conducted raids on downtown vendors ' stalls and violently evicted vendors from choice streets. Fujimori promises to end such treatment. Today during a walk on bustling Avenida Grau, teeming with micro-commerce, it was difficult to find anyone who did not support el chinito -- a popular nickname for Fujimori meaning " the little Chinese guy. " <p> Ironically, Vargas Llosa has long praised the informal economy as Peru 's hope for the future. But his talk of tough economic adjustment was frightening, and those who make their living in that economy saw him as allied with the same conservative establishment that had never done them any favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coalition, one of his two vice presidential candidates, is Maximo San Roman, a manufacturer of bread-making equipment and the president of the Peruvian Association of Small and Medium Industries. Cambio 90 's other vice presidential candidate is Carlos Garcia, a Baptist minister who helped bring Fujimori important support from non-Roman Catholics. These Pentecostalists, Seventh Day Adventists and others were the most effective means of spreading the Cambio 90 gospel door-to-door. <p> Fujimori 's campaign crafted an image to take advantage of what polling firms describe as a growing affinity here for things Japanese, which are seen as advanced and efficient. He posed for campaign photos in a karate suit and in traditional Japanese dress, although he does not practice karate and over the years has not been much involved with the 100,000-strong Japanese-Peruvian community. He has said he will be able to draw foreign aid from Japan. <p> Sen. Enrique Chirinos Soto, a Vargas Llosa backer, has repeatedly contended that Peru is not ready for a " first-generation Peruvian " as president. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have helped Fujimori. Vargas Llosa, in an attempt to end the issue, has said Fujimori " is as Peruvian as I am. " <p> Fujimori has taken pains to be seen as unconnected to the traditional parties. But he has long had links to the ruling Apra party, serving for a time as an adviser to President Alan Garcia, and he reportedly approached leftist candidate Alfonso Barrantes last year about running as a senator on Barrantes 's list. <p> Fujimori 's parents came to Peru from the city of Kumamoto, Japan, in 1934. His father, Naochi, worked as a tailor, then as a security guard and later as a florist. He died in 1971. Fujimori 's mother, Mutsue, still speaks little Spanish. Alberto Fujimori was born in 1938, the second of the couple 's five children. By all accounts he was a good student and in 1960 he graduated from the national Agrarian University in La Molina on the outskirts of Lima. After postgraduate work at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to teach at the Agrarian University and was its president from 1984 to 1989. Fujimori claimed to have left the university with a surplus of $ 7 million, prompting the new rector to ask publicly just where those funds might be found, since they were not evident. " The money is not in cash. It is all invested in programs and development works, " Fujimori said later. <p> His academic specialty was mathematics. But during the campaign he has emphasized his credentials as an " agrarian engineer, " a distinction that gives him a boost in rural areas where the peasants have long complained that no one in Lima understands their problems. <p> Fujimori 's only claim to wider fame before his sudden emergence as a leading political figure was a weekly television talk show he hosted several years ago. On the show, Fujimori invited guests with differing points of view and sought common ground. Insofar as people knew him at all, they knew him as a consensus-builder. <p> Fujimori is married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban house that his wife, Susana Fujimori, says she helped build with her own hands. <p> Associates universally describe Fujimori as straightforward and hard-working. Critics say he has a manipulative streak, pointing to several expedient measures he took as rector of the university apparently to gain support so he would be chosen for another term. The one thing that most people agree on is his ambition. <p> Said a Western diplomat who spent the past week scrambling to get a fix on Fujimori, " What comes through overall is this enormous drive to get ahead.
