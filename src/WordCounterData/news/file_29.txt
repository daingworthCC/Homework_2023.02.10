3004541 @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison opened two years ago. <p> First there was violence. In the first 10 months, 20 inmates at the prison, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, were stabbed, two of them fatally. The prison, it turned out, was taking in maximum-security inmates when it was supposed to be medium-security. <p> Then, after management said it was solving the problems, six inmates, four of them murderers, escaped by cutting through two razor-wire fences in the middle of the afternoon. The inmates were eventually recaptured. <p> It was an alarming record for any prison, but just as troubling to state and city officials here was that they had no way of monitoring or controlling what was happening there : Northeast Ohio was a private prison, the first in the state. <p> As the private prison industry booms across the country, growing to 163 institutions now from one or two in 1984, the lessons of Youngstown have hit hard. Ohio, Texas, Tennessee and several other states have enacted or are considering legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these prisons in their own states. <p> At the Federal level, a bipartisan group of members of Congress from Ohio and New York introduced a bill in March to prohibit Federal inmates from being housed in private prisons. And a number of cities and states are taking less formal approaches in an effort to build tighter controls into contracts with private prison companies. <p> It is not, they say, that private prisons have more problems than public ones. The difference is that the the private prisons may not be subject to the same regulations and oversight. <p> In one way or another, the private prison industry now touches almost every state in the country. As tough sentencing laws have swelled prison populations, some 26 states have private companies operating or building prisons, which can often be built faster than public prisons. And states that do not have private prisons often send their inmates to states that do. <p> Corrections experts and state legislators are most concerned about the relatively small but growing number of prisons like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a prison and promises to fill it with inmates, instead of contracting in advance with the state for a prison that state officials have decided they want. <p> In Youngstown, the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation 's largest operator of private prisons, made a deal with the economically depressed former steel town : Youngstown gave the prison the land for a dollar and the corporation promised to create 450 jobs and find the inmates. It found them in the troubled Lorton prison in the District of Columbia. <p> But while the company had a contract with Washington, there was no contract giving Ohio or Youngstown officials any oversight of the prison. <p> Some small towns and cities " have nothing and so they 're lured by this idea of this prison coming in and bringing this employment, " said Marlene Beckman, special counsel to the Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department who organized a conference on these issues in March. <p> In cases like Youngstown, sometimes called speculative or negotiated prisons, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often one desperate for jobs and corporate taxpayers because its factories or mines have dried up.( In one Minnesota town the mayor even took a job with the private prison.) There is often no contract outlining the prison 's responsibilities to that city or its state ; the prison 's only contract is with the supplier of the inmates. <p> And if there are not enough inmates in the state to fill up the prison, the company may bring in out-of-state inmates, who might misbehave because they are unhappy about being away from home. Some states exporting inmates, including Idaho and Montana, have been so dissatisfied after violence and escapes that they canceled contracts with private prisons in Louisiana and Texas. <p> When a prison operates without state oversight or takes in out-of-state inmates, rules can get muddy. And even if such prisons are not the majority, regulation proponents say they starkly reveal the need for laws that regulate all private prisons and answer certain questions : What are the rights and responsibilities of local law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible in an escape? How much training should prison staff have? <p> " It 's sort of like hazardous waste, " Ms. Beckman said. " When you bring in something that is potentially dangerous, which inmates are, what, if any, obligations do states have to regulate them? " <p> In Youngstown, investigations faulted the District of Columbia for sending violent inmates to Ohio when it was not supposed to. But they also found that the prison 's operator, the Corrections Corporation, did not follow its obligation under its agreement with Washington to obtain and scrutinize the files of prospective inmates and reject unsuitable ones. Typically, medium-security inmates have sentences of 10 years or less. <p> The Corrections Corporation was also criticized for filling up the 1,700-bed prison too fast, and for not separating inmates known to have been violent or threatening to each other. <p> " When I first walked into the prison there were over 250 inmates who had separation orders who were in the same facility, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last March, after the stabbings. " Most prisons do n't operate with known enemies in the same facility. " <p> The problems leading to the escape included failures to monitor the recreation yard, Mr. Turner said. <p> Susan Hart, a spokeswoman for the Corrections Corporation, which operates 74 institutions in this country, said problems were partly due to the prison 's desire to be " user friendly " and to accept the Washington inmates. " If we had to do it all over again, we would certainly do some things differently, " Ms. Hart said. <p> City and state officials were determined to insure that changes would be made. <p> " The Youngstown example, almost in any aspect, says, ' Here 's how not to do it, ' " said Peter Davis, director of the Ohio Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, a watchdog group. " It was the quantity and the breadth of violent things that were occurring in such a short time frame that made it the horror that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America, forming an unusual alliance with another set of plaintiffs, inmates complaining about safety and prison conditions. <p> Significant improvements were made, hundreds of potentially dangerous inmates were transferred, and in a settlement, the company agreed to pay inmates $1.7 million, meet rigorous standards and pay for a Youngstown employee to monitor the prison. <p> State legislators, who passed modest legislation last year after the stabbings, are now proposing tougher bills that would forbid private prisons to accept out-of-state prisoners above the level of medium security. <p> In Ohio and other states, private prison companies have lobbied against some proposed regulations, especially ones that restrict the types of inmates they can house. <p> On the other side, unions of public corrections officers have pushed for strong limits on private prisons, which tend to hire nonunionized workers. These unions are strong in states like New York and New Jersey, which have one privatized immigration detention center apiece. <p> Proponents of private prisons say they cut costs by ordering supplies efficiently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have yielded mixed results. Historically, private prisons have not taken in the most serious offenders. But they are expanding to take more complicated inmates -- those classified as maximum security, mentally ill, juvenile offenders. <p> Wayne Calabrese, president of the second-largest private prison company, Wackenhut Corrections, says his company usually operates through state contracts that do not involve out-of-state prisoners. <p> As for other regulations, Mr. Calabrese said, he would find some acceptable, but objects to those that would bar private prisons from taking certain kinds of inmates or that would try to legislate staffing ratios. <p> Ms. Hart declined to specify which regulations her company would oppose. But some industry analysts said restrictions on out-of-state inmates or speculative prisons would hurt Corrections Corporation more than some other companies. <p> In Tennessee, proposed laws would levy hefty taxes on private prisons and would bar them from bringing in out-of-state inmates. A bill backed by the state 's Governor, Don Sundquist, would ban only out-of-state inmates convicted of crimes like murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters of the bills, both in prisons run by the Corrections Corporation, which is based in Nashville. In one episode, two inmates were transferred out of Youngstown to a prison in Mason, Tenn., where, the authorities said, one stabbed and killed the other. The other incident involved accusations that members of the staff at a prison in Whiteville used excessive force in subduing an attack on a guard by inmates from Wisconsin. <p> Texas passed a law requiring private prisons to meet the requirements of public ones after an escape of two sex offenders from Oregon from a Corrections Corporation institution in 1996. The institution was intended to house illegal immigrants and the corporation never told Texas officials that more than 200 Oregon sex offenders were held there. <p> Similar concerns have arisen in New Mexico, where last year, at a Wackenhut prison, two inmates were fatally stabbed and guards beat one inmate and kicked another handcuffed inmate in the groin. The New Mexico Legislature passed a modest private prison regulatory bill, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lawmakers called for tougher measures. <p> Spokesmen for the prison companies said that their staff members had either acted appropriately or had been disciplined. <p> At Youngstown recently, Mr. Turner, the warden, was eager to show the improvements, including the addition of gun towers, extra fencing and razor wire, and drug-sniffing dogs. State and local officials give Mr. Turner high marks for addressing the problems. <p> But the whole experience has been sobering, said Mayor George McKelvey. <p> " They surely gave us good reason not to trust them, " Mr. McKelvey said. " We know we have to monitor everything they do. " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com
