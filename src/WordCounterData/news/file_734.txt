4195541 <p> Xcel Energy Center was packed on Sunday night. The crowd stood for the entire performance by the Weeknd. The 14,000 fans sang along to every single song. <p> Is the Weeknd the next big R&amp;B/pop superstar? His sold-out tour, two No. 1 albums, three No. 1 songs, two Grammys and all kinds of accolades would seem to suggest so. <p> But frankly his first arena headline appearance in the Twin Cities was less convincing than his well-crafted dark, gloomy pop-soul records. <p> For starters, the staging was n't especially compelling. Billed as Starboy : The Legend of the Fall Tour, this show ostensibly had a space-age theme. Some geometric panels suspended over a catwalk does not a spaceship make, even though they kept morphing like some wannabe super-sized Transformer toy. <p> A more apt title might have been the Project Runway Tour, because the Weeknd spent nearly the entire 80 minutes working a long needle-shaped runway that extended from the main stage. He did n't strut or dance. He 's not a dancer. A few times he jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-man band stationed on the main stage, he was more exciting to listen to than watch, though early in the show the sound was hopelessly and unflatteringly echo-y. <p> JEFF WHEELER * **28;1169;TOOLONG <p> The Weeknd brought his Starboy World Tour to Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul Sunday night, fighting some bad acoustics but rousing the sold-out crowd. <p> The Weeknd has a fascinating voice, a supple tenor that recalls Michael Jackson in its elastic soulfulness. Some of his vocal showcases, like the early hit " Wicked Games " and the ballad " Angel, " were positively gorgeous, causing couples around the arena to swoon on date night. When he ended " Angel " with the soaring line " somebody to love, " you could sense libidos in action. <p> And then he followed that dynamic duo with " Earned It, " his first big pop hit and arguably the best thing about the movie " Fifty Shades of Grey " -- and OMG, the crowd went wild. <p> Of course, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Born Abel Tesfaye 27 years ago in Toronto, the Weeknd began making a name for himself with mix tapes in 2011. He opted for the odd spelling of his moniker because a Canadian band had trademarked the Weekend. Among those helping him early in his career was producer Doc McKinney, who started his career in Minneapolis before moving to Toronto. <p> The Weeknd got a break when Drake took a shine to him and they collaborated on several songs on Drake 's sophomore album, " Take Care. " That led to the Weeknd 's recording deal and his 2015 best-seller, " Beauty Behind the Madness. " <p> Of course, his big hits were the big winners on Sunday. " Ca n't Feel My Face, " the 2015 blockbuster, was the kind of contagious dance tune that the Weeknd needed to perk up his overly mellow repertoire. And he closed with the chart-topping " The Hills, " a big ballad with a big beat and 14,000 backup singers. <p> The relatively brief performance suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dynamic stage presence in order to be mentioned in the same breath with Bruno Mars as America 's new multi-generational R&amp;B/pop superstar. <p> The last-gasp Republican drive to tear down President Barack Obama 's health care law essentially died Monday as Maine Sen. Susan Collins joined a small but decisive cluster of GOP senators in opposing the push.
