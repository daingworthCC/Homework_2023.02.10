3047241 <p> IN JULY, Theater 3 in the Pasadena movie house is packed. The film being previewed is " Aladdin, " the 31st animated feature to carry the Disney name, and loosely based on one of the best-known fables of " A Thousand and One Nights. " As the narrator, a weathered street vendor, begins to spin the tale of an urchin and a mythical lamp, it 's as if the audience has climbed on the magic carpet behind Aladdin. And when the lights go up 84 minutes later, the applause is thunderous. <p> The movie, which opens Wednesday at the Regency I and Century Plaza theaters, is a departure for Disney and, some insiders say, a creative risk. At its heart, " Aladdin, " calculated as costing more than $ 35 million, is a contemporary blend of comedy, action- adventure and romance from a studio that always has cautioned its animators to think classically, so their work could stand the test of time. <p> This film 's loose look is the visual antithesis of the traditional realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreverent, at times poking fun at the studio and its animated traditions, with short comic bits that feature everyone from Pinocchio to Groucho Marx. <p> There was a struggle to keep a near-runaway performance by comedian Robin Williams, who is the voice of the Genie, from overshadowing other elements ; it took three major script revisions to strengthen Aladdin 's story enough to counterbalance his performance. And in what proved to be a deeply emotional as well as an artistic blow to the project, lyricist Howard Ashman, who had been so fundamental to the success of three previous Disney animated films -- " Oliver and Company, " " The Little Mermaid " and " Beauty and the Beast " -- died last year. <p> " Aladdin " comes at a time when the feature animation industry is experiencing a renaissance. Disney 's stunning success last year with " Beauty and the Beast " has raised hopes for the industry. That movie broke financial barriers by earning $ 141 million at the domestic box office( a figure unheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination and sold 7 million copies in its first few days of release on videotape. But success also has raised expectations. And what was once exclusively Disney 's turf is now filled with a cacophony of artistic voices. <p> For nearly 60 years, Disney defined feature animation for most movie-going audiences. But in the ' 80s, virtually every other major studio also was getting into the business. Twenty feature-length animated films are in various stages of development elsewhere and the competition keeps Disney unsettled. <p> " It does always scare us to think that somebody else is going to come along and do better, " says Disney president Jeffrey Katzenberg. <p> But, while Disney will not release budgets, those familiar with the studio peg the budget for its animated movies at an average of $ 35 million, easily a third more than the competition 's most enterprising projects. Katzenberg has four animated movies in the works besides " Aladdin, " including " King of the Jungle, " to be released next year, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a stop-motion animation project under way with former Disney animator Tim Burton, the director of the " Batman " films ; and computer specialist John Lasseter is working on a project to test the limits of animation. <p> " Animation has totally seduced me, " Katzenberg says. <p> The lessons Disney learns on each film always are factored into the next. After " Beauty and the Beast " had been in preproduction for a year, Katzenberg dumped the first script, because, he says, he learned with the disappointing 1990 film " Rescuers Down Under " that the story must be as strong as the animation. <p> " Our business is laid out so far into the future, if ' Aladdin ' tanks on us, if we have made some terrible miscalculation here, which is possible, it 's going to be years before we get it fixed, " Katzenberg says. " Whatever the movie gods decide is the fate of ' Aladdin, ' the die is already cast. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney system for three years. The story unfolds in the mythical Arabian kingdom of Agrabah, with arabesque towers rising out of endless desert sands. There, Aladdin survives on his wits and what he and his monkey Abu can steal in the marketplace. Behind the palace walls, Princess Jasmine dreams of the kind of freedom Aladdin enjoys, while her father, the befuddled Sultan, dreams of marrying her off. There is, of course, a villain, the Sultan 's cunning vizier, Jafar. <p> Then there 's the wickedly funny, big blue Genie with an attitude -- courtesy of manic comedian Williams -- who roars on being awakened when Aladdin rubs the lamp : " Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck, oy! " <p> In a radical break with tradition, the studio went outside its own ranks to recruit the animator who would create the Genie. Eric Goldberg 's flamboyant style, heavily influenced in this film by illustrator Al Hirschfeld, results in a more cartoony character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for. The style was quickly adopted by the other animators. Stylistic consistency was a colossal task, since, by the time the film wrapped, more than 600 animators, artists and technicians had worked on " Aladdin. " <p> When, in the past, the handful of lead animators went off by themselves, " the characters did n't look as if they really belonged together, " says Andreas Deja, lead animator on Jafar, the villain. " Early on, we began meeting to compare our designs so that it would look like one world, one style of rhythmic, flowing lines. " <p> The color palette for " Aladdin " is bold and mystical : red-hot tones signal danger, yellows are warning signs, greens and blues relaxing. The shapes in the film also carry a graphic subtext : round is good, points are evil. So while the Genie seems pillow-soft, Jafar was designed with straight lines, from the pattern on his turban to the tips of his skinny fingers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the personalities layered with subtleties. And the comedy is broad, with a contemporary edge unseen in previous Disney films. <p> Clearly, the driving force of " Aladdin " is the Genie, a giant cloud of smoke that transforms itself into more than 70 characters, from Jack Nicholson to a harem girl. As with all animated characters, success depends on the talents of the animator and the actor doing the voice. Animators play the voice tracks over and over, sketching the action until they visualize what is being said and how. With the Genie, who was very much at the mercy of Williams ' mercurial style, the job was monumental. The Genie was the only character Goldberg wanted to draw. <p> " I love comedy, " says Goldberg, 37. He spent most of his career in London, in recent years heading his own commercial animation house, Pizzazz, until Disney finally convinced him to join the studio in 1990 to begin work on " Aladdin. " <p> With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created a fast- paced, stream-of-consciousness visual comedy that at times threatened to take over the film. " Having Robin 's performance as strong as it was -- and not knowing whether we had a beginning, a middle and an end -- there is no question the potential was there for him to completely overwhelm the movie, " Katzenberg says. " But now, when he 's not on the screen, there 's enough storytelling and enough of a romance that I 'm not sitting there tapping my foot saying, ' OK, this is nice, but when 's he coming back? ' " <p> John Musker and Ron Clements, the co- directors, were also the creative force behind " The Little Mermaid. " They worked 12-hour days scheduled down to the minute, operating with a sort of repressed panic. They conducted two- and three-hour sessions with Katzenberg, Schneider and the animators, in which " Aladdin " was dissected frame by frame. Problems put the movie dangerously close to missing its November deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reworked several times, and there have been three separate scripts for " Aladdin, " the first based on a treatment by Ashman, who with Alan Menken wrote six songs for the movie, three of which survived. The two had begun working on " Aladdin " before taking a break to write all the music for " Beauty and the Beast. " <p> The second version of the story, which was written after Ashman 's death last year, required three new songs, which began the collaboration between Menken and Rice. The entire movie was then storyboarded and sketches were filmed and shown to Katzenberg. <p> " Jeffrey said, ' It does n't work ; start again, ' " Schneider says. <p> In the third major revision, Aladdin 's mother was written out of the script, and he was changed from a young boy to a teenager. The animators also were asked to deal with the fact that, whenever Aladdin and Princess Jasmine were on the screen together, Aladdin seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruise. " In ' Top Gun, ' Tom Cruise carried himself with a kind of confidence and an air of invincibility, " lead animator Glen Keane says. " All of our men have tended to be princely, but soft and delicate like the prince in ' Sleeping Beauty. ' With ' Aladdin, ' we 've given the male lead more of a masculine quality. " <p> After the July test screening in Pasadena, Katzenberg, Schneider, Rice and the others in the Disney group head across the street to a trendy restaurant. Despite the children 's vociferous approval of the picture, its makers are still worrying, and still planning improvements. <p> " At this point in ' Beauty and the Beast, ' I was a scared puppy, " Katzenberg tells the group before leaving them to digest his criticisms. " I do n't have that same fear with ' Aladdin, ' but I 'm not dancing on the table either. " <p> With Walt Disney 's legacy to carry on, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to, success for Disney is far more than merely breaking even. Indeed, there is considerable pressure for the studio to deliver not just a film. Katzenberg must deliver a blockbuster.
