3049041 <p> SAT TELLS LITTLE ABOUT STUDENT 'S ABILITY <p> Editor -- The SAT should most definitely be abandoned, but not for the ludicrous reasons given in your recent cover story. This issue is not one of race or gender : the SAT is simply not representative of a student 's academic abilities or potential and should not carry the weight it does in deciding a student 's future. <p> When I was applying to colleges, I had below-average scores but ended up graduating summa cum laude from my chosen university, even winning my department 's highest award. <p> When applying to graduate programs, I had to take the SAT 's big brother : the GRE. Again I scored poorly and was turned away by all the American programs to which I had applied, although my grades were top- notch. I went instead to earn my master 's degree in Britain, where they have no SATs and GREs, and again did very well. <p> In my wonderful two years living and studying in Europe, I realized that the SAT is a characteristically American thing. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can put someone on a chart we will happily do so, and then determine their life 's worth from that rating. <p> British universities judge the academic potential of students by the best criteria of all : their grades. In such a system the SAT has no place, and that is as it should be. American educators could learn a lot by looking across the Atlantic. I certainly learned a lot by going. <p> JOHN D. KNUTSEN <p> Stockton <p>. <p> NEXT, PLEASE <p> Editor -- Thanks to Governor Pete Wilson, our next statewide ballot will include an initiative requiring that unions get written consent from their members before using union funds to support or oppose candidates or legislation. <p> Next, please, may we have an initiative requiring that corporations obtain written consent from their shareholders before using corporate funds to influence elections or lobby for or against legislation? <p> Somehow I 'm not holding my breath. <p> ANNE WEST <p> Inverness <p>. <p> CHECCHI 'S BOTTOM LINE <p> Editor -- I appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax in Minnesota "( November 18), pointing out the discrepancy between what gubernatorial candidate Al Checchi says and what he does with regard to valuing children and education. <p> Apparently, Checchi and the other owners of Northwest Airlines( including Dianne Feinstein 's husband, Richard Blum) had a chance to help poor students in Minnesota. All they had to do was pay their fair share of taxes, but they figured it was more important for their top executives to become even more obscenely rich instead. <p> It 's a sad commentary on the state of our citizenry that a corporation like Northwest would even consider trying to justify its actions following their " hardball " lobbying against responsibility by publicly stating, " Northwest... did n't think it was a good pub lic policy to fund a program that benefited the community as a whole. " Imagine that! Heaven forbid a corporation should think of the welfare of the community before they think of feeding the bottomless pit of their greed. <p> We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down value system run amok that we 've all but stopped trying to build a world that would actually be fair and make sense for all of us. <p> If we do n't wake up and take a stand against greed and for valuing human needs and human relationships we deserve Checchi for governor. In reality, he and people like him do n't deserve to have any power or influence whatsoever. <p> RENEE VOWELS <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> NO MORE SELLOUTS <p> Editor -- I 'm tired of mean- spirited center-right politics. The person who takes Ron Dellums ' place should be a liberal who does n't mutate into a sellout. The only person I would trust to go to Congress is Angela Alioto. <p> THORNTON KIMES <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> USE THE WHERRY HOUSING <p> Editor -- Having grown up in San Francisco and played often in Golden Gate Park, I share the concerns of neighbors surrounding the park to " get something done " about homeless individuals and families camping there. <p> But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty and unable to help with this growing crisis. I am referring to the 466 vacant units of Wherry housing at the edge of the Presidio -- housing that the Presidio Trust and Park Service wants destroyed because its preservation was n't in the original Presidio Plan. <p> How myopic and silly. All that needs to happen is a transfer of that " off the tourist map " housing to the city of San Francisco. Through a fair and competitive process the city can then sub- lease the 466 units to capable nonprofit organizations who have years of experience working with people without homes or those threatened by homelessness. <p> We can only solve this critical problem by working together at all levels of government and the private sector. We are a smart and progressive city. Let 's just do it. <p> HELEN HELFER <p> Bernal Heights <p> Neighborhood Center <p>. <p> HELLOOOOO, KEVIN! <p> Editor -- Re : Kevin Leary 's dissenting view on the " Barbie " editorial in Wednesday 's paper. If men are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our friend Kevin to call the mothership and head back home. My point is that I was one of those little girls playing with Barbies in the early Sixties and( surprise, Kevin!) it was about " sex and materialism. " Mr. Leary 's words were, " attractive dolls with lots of clothes and accessories. " Listen carefully, Kevin : " shapely, attractive, 38-18-34 " = sexy. " Rich and accomplished... fancy cars, vast wardrobe " = materialism. Hellooooo, Kevin. <p> Further, the " role model " you mention, Barbie as doctor, broadcaster and stewardess( now " flight attendant, " Kevin, where have you been?) is pure baloney. You can only sell so many prom dresses before you lose your audience, dear. It was pure marketing, and we all know it. <p> Now, I do n't know what you were doing with your Barbie doll, Kevin, but true to the times, my girlfriends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they 'd have because these were the tall, blond, big breasted, beautiful girls. Barbie was a " role model " who could never have stood up on her own two feet because those poor tiny appendages were permanently fashioned for impossibly high stiletto heels, without which she 'd topple over like the empty-headed miniature mannequin she was. What a message. <p> GEORGIA MONTGOMERY <p> San Rafael <p>. <p> DEAR LITTLE HEATHER <p> Editor -- Here is my response to little Heather Lucas, regarding " A Woman 's Value "( Letters, November 18). <p> You missed the point, young girl. Letting our daughters be what they are does not designate girls to all become mothers, but, rather, women( i.e., female). <p> In spite of society 's strive to make this a gender-neutral society, men are male and women are female. That is what makes life interesting! <p> I noticed that in Ms. Lucas 's letter she hopes to eventually have a career and a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life. <p> Sorry, little Heather, but when the kids come along, they also come first. No matter how successful you are in your career, when your kids get sick, they 're going to call for you, their mommy first( even if Daddy is right there). <p> I used to be Ms. Career Woman, but now just call me MOM. <p> VICTORIA DARNELL <p> Corning <p>. <p> A GREAT MONUMENT <p> Editor -- Is it true that the latest monument in Washington is The Tomb of the Unknown Contributor? <p> WARREN SUGARMAN <p> San Mateo
