3031741 <p> LAS VEGAS -- To be regarded as boxing 's top pound-for-pound champion at 40 is a remarkable feat, but especially for Bernard Hopkins, who " by the grace of God " was n't dead before 18. <p> Street thug and prison number Y4145 preceded the lofty title of middleweight champion of the world that Hopkins has held for 10 years. It is a reign he hopes to extend with a division-record 21st title defense Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena against unbeaten Jermain Taylor. <p> Taylor, 26, is expected to pose a tough hurdle for the undisputed champion from Philadelphia. The Little Rock native is a 2000 Olympic bronze medalist and a versatile boxer with a stiff jab whose 23 victories include 17 knockouts. But overcoming obstacles and taking calculated risks are n't new to Hopkins( 46-2-1, 32 KOs), The Ring magazine 's No. 1-ranked pound-for-pound boxer. <p> " The Executioner " plans to hang up his gloves by his 41st birthday Jan.15. As his own manager, he 's plotting the final stages of his career in the judicious manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his life after his 1988 release from Graterford( Pa.) State Penitentiary, where he served a five-year sentence for strong-arm robbery. <p> " The one thing I 've always been is a leader, " Hop-kins says. " Even when I was out in the streets doing all kinds of wrong and ended up going to prison, I was never a follower. The guys I rode with looked up to me. " <p> These days, there 's little resemblance between the older, wiser Hopkins and the menace to society who grew up in North Philly. <p> " I was knocking guys out in the streets before I knew how to throw a jab and keep your chin down, " Hopkins says. " In most neighborhoods, the guy that could fight gets respect. You got in the parties free. I never had to pay the dollar because people were scared of me. But back then I was ignorant. " <p> Although he has been hardened by his past, his background allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as spokesman for the Philadelphia public schools ' Knock Out the Violence with Peace program. He volunteers talking to youngsters about making the right choices, having self-respect and showing respect for others. <p> " The neat thing about Bernard is, even though he 's 40 years old, he 's in tremendous physical shape and still has a youthful conversation that allows him to relate to young people very effectively, " says Malik Aziz, director of the mayor 's Safe Schools, Safer Communities Program in Philadelphia. <p> " He had to prove himself, because even when he was making headway in boxing, people still looked at him as a thug with a criminal record. But the more Bernard started being around people, this city realized it had a jewel. He 's moved to another economic level, but he 's not a braggart and he does n't try to belittle people. <p> " He 's just a regular person who realizes that by the grace of God, " Aziz says, " he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life. " <p> Uneasy start <p> Boxing helped Hopkins get through 56 months of incarceration. He won four national middleweight penitentiary titles and used his time behind bars to earn his general equivalency diploma. He was 17 when he was locked up and 22 when he walked out, facing nine years of probation but determined to never go back. <p> Hopkins ' will was tested after he turned pro in 1988. Fighting as a light heavyweight, he lost his four-round debut against Clinton Mitchell in Atlantic City. <p> " I got my butt kicked, " says Hopkins, who questioned whether boxing was in his future. Or for that matter, whether he had a future. <p> A convicted felon, he was stuck working in a Philadelphia hotel kitchen, getting paid under the table and eventually getting laid off. With no motivation to train, he did n't fight again for 15 months. <p> " You 're talking about positive-negative, like a tug of war, " he says. " That whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the penitentiary or dead or whether I was going to pull up my bootstraps and fulfill my goal, even though I failed the first time. And, remember, I still had eight years of parole left. So I had a decision to make. <p> " I could have said( forget) everything because the system threw me away. They do n't want to give me a chance. I 'm going back in the streets. ' But I remembered what the guard told me when I left the penitentiary. I said, ' I 'm never coming back, ' and he said, ' See you in six months. ' <p> " Doubters have always motivated Bernard Hopkins, " he says. " Just telling me something I ca n't do, that moves me to go forward just to make a point that I 'm not going to let you dictate my future. I went back to the gym because I loved boxing and I did n't want to be Y4145 again. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 consecutive victories before losing an IBF middleweight title bout to Roy Jones Jr. in 1993. That was the last time he lost and proved to be an awakening. To that point, Hopkins ' career had been guided by promoters, but the feeling of being cheated made him determined to expand his knowledge of the sport 's business side. <p> " I was totally ignorant to boxing other than throwing punches, " says Hopkins, who sued promoter Butch Lewis for breach of contract in 1997 and won after he was paid only $250,000 and ended up with just $60,000 after taxes of a $1 million purse for the Jones fight. " That 's when I became eager to learn why did it happen, how did it happen and how to prevent it. " <p> For years, his squabbles with promoters, in and outside the courtroom, kept Hopkins from getting big-money fights. But his perseverance and business acumen have paid off. <p> He won the vacant IBF middleweight crown in December 1994 when he decisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major payday until September 2001 when he defeated Felix " Tito " Trinidad to win a tournament for the undisputed middleweight crown, earning $2 million. <p> The $10 million he earned last September when he defended his title with a ninth-round knockout of Oscar De La Hoya was his biggest purse, but it meant much more. Largely on the basis of making that fight happen, Hopkins was named 2004 Manager of the Year. He was just the second active fighter( George Foreman the other) to be so honored by the Boxing Writers Association of America. <p> " I 've been called stupid for five, 10, 15 years, and I get manager of the year, " Hopkins says. " I 've got a lot of people mad at me because of the success I 've had. " <p> Guiding the new generation <p> Shortly after their fight, Hopkins joined with De La Hoya to become part-owner of Golden Boy Promotions, with the title of president of Golden Boy East. <p> Hopkins is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters, many from his boxing-rich hometown. Demetrius Hopkins, his nephew and an unbeaten welterweight( 19-0-1, six KOs) from Philadelphia, is among those on board. <p> " This sport is unlike baseball, basketball and football where they have agents, lawyers and education behind them, " De La Hoya says. " Most fighters come from humble beginnings and make bad decisions because they have to rely on other people. <p> " Me and Bernard, being fighters ourselves, can show these fighters it 's about time we stand up and make a statement that we are smart people that can take charge of our careers. I think the wheel is getting reinvented when it comes to boxing. " <p> Hopkins has recently been in a war of words with Lou DiBella -- his former adviser and now Taylor 's promoter -- stemming from a defamation lawsuit DiBella filed against Hopkins. It resulted in a $610,000 judgment in DiBella 's favor. Hopkins appealed but lost. He says Taylor will have to bear the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of two, and possibly three, big pay-per-view fights that will allow him a chance to go out with a bang. <p> " The motivation now is to get the guys that I know that give me a greater threat, " says Hopkins, who has targeted Antonio Tarver, the linear light heavyweight champion, as his next fight if he gets past Taylor. <p> He also is entertaining the possibility of a rematch against Jones Jr. <p> " That 's the hunger that will keep me around until this year is over. This year has to be a year that people will remember for the rest of their lives and the ending of the book, the ending of my long career that has been exciting in itself with downs and ups and maybe a book or movie script in the future. " <p> Hopkins lives in a lavish home in suburban Wilmington, Del., with his wife of 12 years, Jeanette, and daughter, Latrece, 6. <p> The other lady in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as a single parent. She died two years ago of cancer. <p> " If my mom was here, I would n't still be boxing, " Hopkins says. " I had promised her I would n't be fighting at 40 and she kept waiting for 40, but by that time she had passed. But this is all like blessings in disguise for me because I 'm still here able to fight. " <p> Hopkins says his prison past helps keep him focused and grounded. He says it also gives him an added edge on Taylor and other fighters who have n't walked in his shoes. <p> " There 's not a day that goes by that I do n't remember those 56 months in prison, " he says. " That edge might seem small, but that 's my lifeline to stay the way I am because I have n't forgotten. <p> " There 's plenty of times that I could have quit. But I can always reach back to where I came from and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going. " <p>
