I 'm proud of that heritage.

Erdogan demanded G? len 's extradition and began a sweeping purge of alleged G? len supporters inside and outside government. <p> But even before the coup attempt, an attorney hired by the Turkish government -- and some other critics -- were asserting that charters in numerous states, including the 10 run by Magnolia Public Schools, had improper ties to G? len. <p> The most extreme allegations are that the well over 100 charter schools managed by first- or second-generation Turkish immigrants are controlled by G? len or his close followers, who funnel U.S. taxpayer funds to the G? len movement. <p> Charters are independently managed public schools that are exempt from some rules that govern traditional campuses. <p> " This is much deeper and darker than people familiar with the charter-school debate understand, " said attorney Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being paid $50,000 a month by the Turkish government. <p> The 52 Miss America contestants, from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, arrived at the Atlantic City Boardwalk on Tuesday. <p> The 52 Miss America contestants, from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, arrived at the Atlantic City Boardwalk on Tuesday. <p> State and federal investigations have yet to proclaim any direct links between the schools and G? len. Nor have they talked about taxpayer funds being secreted abroad. Past investigations, however, have turned up issues in contracting, management and hiring practices at schools with Turkish leadership. <p> One area of concern has been the reliance on a network of Turkish contractors to provide services to these schools, which is not illegal if the bidding for work is fair and the money is spent properly. <p> Magnolia 's use of a firm called Accord Institute for Educational Research attracted attention from L.A. Unified and the state auditor.

While he was at Magnolia, Accord secured a $700,000 contract for work with the charter, the state auditor reported in 2015. <p> Yapanel, Magnolia 's board president, acknowledged that he had a part-time job with Accord when he was board president of another charter in Colorado. <p> State and local auditors looking at Magnolia also unearthed a long list of poor financial practices. Citing these issues, L.A. Unified moved to shut down two Magnolia schools, which Magnolia thwarted by suing and then agreeing to improve management practices. The school cut ties with Accord. <p> Magnolia also turned over its chief executive position to Caprice Young, a former L.A. school board member who later headed the California Charter Schools Assn. Even some critics concede that Young has improved Magnolia 's business practices. <p> The state auditor was largely satisfied with Magnolia 's progress, although L.A.

As a student, he was part of a small team that founded Lotus School for Excellence in Aurora, Colo., and he served as its board president for five years. His interest in education, he said, was in part a reaction to the rigid Turkish schooling model. <p> " Education can be limiting when you tell students there is one way to do things, " Yapanel said. <p> His primary employment has been as an engineer, most recently in the cellphone industry. He became involved with Magnolia, which opened its first school in 2002, as it was starting a school in Santa Clara. In 2012, the school 's leadership asked him to be board president. The current schools, which enroll 3,800 students, all are in Southern California. <p> The schools celebrate Turkish culture and some offer Turkish language instruction -- but they do no proselytizing, officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on state standardized tests. <p> Still, Magnolia 's operations -- including any G? len role -- have merited scrutiny, said L.A. school board President Steve Zimmer. <p> " The question is how did that influence the practices and potentially the pedagogy of the people running these schools and the business practices of the organization, " he said.
