3055141 <p> NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The Florida Marlins traded 1997 World Series hero Edgar Renteria to St. Louis on Monday night, leaving them with just four players from their title team. <p> The Marlins were to receive three minor leaguers for Renteria, a source with knowledge of the deal said. <p> Renteria, 23, hit.282 with three home runs and 31 RBIs and stole 41 bases in 1998. He fills the hole created July 31 when the Cardinals sent shortstop Royce Clayton to Texas, and was available because he is arbitration eligible and because the Marlins are high on a shortstop in their system, Alex Gonzales <p> Renteria ended the 1997 Series with a two-out single off Cleveland 's Charles Nagy in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7, giving Florida a 3-2 victory. <p> The Marlins immediately began dismantling their club after the victory in a salary purge that caused an unprecedented turnover. <p> Renteria became the 21st player to depart from the Series roster, leaving only pitchers Livan Hernandez and Antonio Alfonseca, second baseman Craig Counsell and outfielder Cliff Floyd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series because of injury. <p> Cubs deal Brown for Lieber - Brant Brown, who nearly cost the Cubs a spot in the playoffs when he dropped a fly ball in the season 's final week, was traded to the Pirates for pitcher Jon Lieber. <p> Brown, 27, hit.291 last season with 14 homers and 48 RBIs. He is best known for dropping a fly ball on Sept. 23 on what would have been the final out of a 7-5 win. Three runs scored to give the Brewers an 8-7 victory. <p> The Cubs got into the playoff anyway, beating the Giants in one-game wild-card playoff five days later. <p> " We 'll probably play Brant Brown in center field, " said Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay. " We feel like he 's a fine defensive player. " <p> Lieber, 28, was 8-14 with a 4.11 ERA last season. " We think he 'll have good success in Wrigley Field, " Cubs GM Ed Lynch said. <p> Mariners acquire Huskey - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huskey to the Mariners for minor league pitcher Lesli Brea. <p> " I was prepared for this, but it 's still a shock, " said Huskey, who joined the Mets organization in 1990. " The Mets had been my home away from home, but they made a decision and I was the odd man out. " <p> After trading for Bobby Bonilla and signing Rickey Henderson this offseason, the Mets no longer had a place for Huskey in the lineup, and they have Jermaine Allensworth and Roger Cedeno in reserve. <p> He is expected to play right field with Jay Buhner, bothered by a bad elbow, moving to first base. <p> McGwire, Sosa share award - Sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who staged a summer-long home-run battle, are Sports Illustrated 's Sportsmen of the Year. <p> It marked the seventh time in the 45-year history of the award that there have been multiple winners. Both McGwire and Sosa broke Roger Maris ' single-season record home run record. McGwire finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe DiMaggio felt good enough Monday to sit up in bed and talk football with his lawyer, another step in his remarkable recovery from a coma that had left him near death. <p> " Joe looked great this morning, " attorney Morris Engelberg said.
