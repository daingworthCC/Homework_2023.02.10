3041941 <p> Each week the Gwinnett Extra asks readers to respond to a question of public interest. Last week 's question was : What are the ideal qualities for a school superintendent? <p> Many Gwinnett residents were left apprehensive when Gwinnett School Superintendent George Thompson resigned this month. <p> Thompson asked to be released from his contract by Jan. 1 after he accepted a job with the Center for Leadership in School Reform, a private, nonprofit group in Louisville, Ky. It provides assistance to school systems going through reform. <p> Thompson was superintendent for five years of the 80,340-student school system. <p> Lately Thompson has endured a firestorm of criticism, principally from critics of Outcomes Based Education, a program he tried to implement. Outcomes Based Education is a reform movement intended to shift educators ' focus from what students are taught to what they have learned. <p> Controversy over OBE has been boiling for about a year in Gwinnett, but Thompson says he has n't been chased off by OBE critics. In fact, he said, the loud criticism may have attracted the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge to me that perhaps increased my reputation around the country, " he said. <p> In any case, Thompson said, it is time for a change. <p> " The average tenure for superintendents in larger districts is two to 2 1/2 years, " he said. " I lasted twice as long as most. This is not about OBE, not about board turnover. I would have taken this regardless of what happened. This is a first-class national organization, and an excellent opportunity. " <p> Associate Superintendent for Business and Finance David Crews is charged with leading the search for a replacement for Thompson. <p> " During the next 30 to 60 days my job will be to facilitate the board in identifying the qualities they want in a superintendent, " Crews said. " At this point, rather than giving my opinion, I should be listening to what other people are saying. At the Nov. 15 board meeting I will take to the board the various options they have in the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about what qualities they would like to see in the next superintendent. <p> Needs mainstream values <p> By George Ford, Tucker <p> I would like a superintendent that would represent the values of mainstream Gwinnett. He or she must be aware of and must be able to deal with the tactics of extremist groups both on the left and on the right, who are trying to manipulate public education. I feel that the superintendent should be an average Gwinnettian. <p> Few qualified applicants <p> By Deb Elvin, Centerville <p> I 'm concerned that with all of the controversy on a local and a national level that potential candidates will be gun-shy to Gwinnett for any amount of money. I 'm concerned that we 'll only be able to attract someone from the Christian Coalition. We do not have a huge number of wonderfully qualified applicants. Based on leanings in the county, the church would like to run schools. <p> Earn citizens ' respect <p> By Donald F. Valtman, Lilburn <p> In addition to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proffered, I want to suggest some real qualities that the new superintendent will need and some documentation as to why they will be needed : <p> Respect - Show a little respect for the citizens who will pay his/her salary : The school system organization chart shows citizens at the top, i.e. we are supposed to be the ultimate " bosses. " When you attend a board meeting, however, notice that the meeting room is always arranged so that the speakers face the board/superintendent with the backs to the " bosses " in the audiences. A simple faux pas - who knows? In any event, the new superintendent can eliminate any exhibition of self- aggrandizement by simply turning around the speaker 's podium. <p> Smarts - Quit reinforcing citizen perceptions of a bloated administrative bureaucracy : While attending a board meeting and looking at the backs of speakers, study the two long tables on both sides of the board/superintendent dais. These tables seat some 10-12 Central Office staff. The staff rarely says or does anything at board meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new superintendent could start lessening this perception by not displaying his/her sizeable cabinet at every public meeting. <p> Courtesy - Consider( or at least pretend to consider) citizen suggestions offered at public hearings : <p> Last May, the board held a public hearing to receive citizen input on the 1994-1995 school system budget. I took the time to submit written observations and suggestions. I hardly returned to my seat before the board voted up the budget with no changes. It has long been obvious that the board/superintendent ignores critical citizen input, but if the new superintendent wants to get off to a better start, he/she should at least wait a couple of days after a public hearing before voting up predetermined budgets or other matters. <p> Leadership - Lead by example rather than oratory : <p> The current superintendent said, in reference to Mr. Brian Bown, that one ca n't pick and choose the laws one has to obey. Very true! Had the current superintendent personally followed this advice and aggressively disciplined offenders within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he possessed the character and integrity to direct the education of their children. The new superintendent would be well-advised to lead by example and demand his subordinates do the same. <p> Candor-facts - Just the facts : <p> Every time a school system supporter refers to our school system, it 's always described as " the best school system in the state of Georgia. " There 's no question that the Gwinnett school system is a good school system, but what facts exist to support the oft repeated " best in Georgia " claim? If the new superintendent wants citizen support, he/she needs to give us some hard data as opposed to just parroting the " best in Georgia " theme. <p> Honesty best policy <p> By Mendy K. Huff, Lilburn <p> I think that first he should be honest and open-minded and he should be willing to see what parents want for their children. He or she should be committed to listening to the parents views and incorporate those views in the board 's decisions. He must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He must be dedicated to reinstituting an exceptional and demanding academic curriculum thereby completely abandoning the current strategic plan which is not reform. <p> It 's more than a job <p> By Robin Small, Lilburn <p> I feel that he should focus on what parents and the community want for their children. I think that he should have the highest integrity. I think he should be committed to children ; it should be more than a job. He also needs to have a good outlook on the future of the schools. He needs to look at getting computers for the schools. <p> Focus on academics <p> By Diane Gervais, Suwanee <p> The new superintendent needs to have enough resolve to resist special interest groups such as those supporting OBE. He needs to be able to listen to people 's opinions concerning the controversy with the new methods of teaching, but to be firm to what he believes. <p> The last superintendent could have avoided a lot of problems. OBE is largely unpopular. He needs to be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with anything that comes into school as far as ideology. He needs to listen to people, but be able to say " no. " He needs to welcome ideas, but to jump into something that is controversial is bad. <p> I 'm glad we 're getting a new superintendent. He needs to lean toward academics. I think all of the candidates will qualify education-wise. He needs to be strong. It 's a high position and it will take a special person to do the job. The Gwinnett County School System needs improvements and this is a start. He needs to be able to say : " Whether you like it or not, this is what we are going to do. " I really think OBE took a lot of time and energy. <p> Kids are main objective <p> By Rosemary Leonard, Norcross <p> The person would have to be a kind person who can go down to the level of the children and understand them and their problems in learning. He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have parents. He would have to be a strong and gentle person and yet be tough underneath. I hope they will find someone for the kids. They are the main objective after all. If you ca n't get an education, you ca n't get anywhere. You have to have the knowledge. <p> Be aware of community <p> By Susan Larson, Lilburn <p> I think that the new superintendent will need to realize that Gwinnett parents are educated and involved and they have been accustomed to having an administration that encourages and is responsive to their input. He will be aware that many desires and demands of Gwinnett citizens such as having more emphasis placed on academics were reflected in the rewriting of the strategic plan. He needs to be able to deal pragmatically with both the school system and the community. <p> Look to 21st century <p> By Debbie Tuschall, Norcross <p> We need someone who has the vision necessary to take education into the 21st century. We need someone with strong positive leadership qualities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various constituencies in the county and to cooperate and provide the best education for our children. <p> Family values important <p> By Don Martini, Norcross <p> The ideal school superintendent should be someone who : <p> Supports traditional family values. <p> Has strong leadership skills and is able to delegate, motivate, communicate and listen. Additionally, compassion, understanding and strong interpersonal relationship skills should be part of their abilities. <p> Keeps academic excellence as their number one priority. <p> Holds discipline to be an integral part of the learning process. <p> Views parents as allies. <p> Has or has had children in public school system. <p> Do n't be too arrogant <p> By Steve Taylor, Lilburn <p> The superintendent needs to be skilled at balancing the input from the public and from the professional education communities. He or she ca n't be too arrogant to listen to parents, but also ca n't abandon good teaching practices whenever someone criticizes them. The superintendent will have to be aggressive about communication. When everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard, we have the best chance of reaching consensus. <p> Honest Christian needed <p> By Judy Barrett, Loganville <p> He should be a Christian. He should be an honest, fair-minded and impartial person. If I had that kind of person leading my kids, I 'd be happy.
