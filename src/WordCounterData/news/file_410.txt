3069341 <p> Too many excuses <p> Re : ' Racial disparity in prison stirs call, ' Aug. 22. <p> It angers me the lengths to which liberals and Democrats will go to try and incite racial bias concerns among the minority communities of blacks and Hispanics rather than deal with the fact that more crimes, as a percentage of total crimes, are committed by these minorities than any other group. <p> The article dealing with racial disparity in prisons is so flawed in its assertions and the conclusions reached that it borders on journalistic malpractice. The implied suggestion that blacks in prison should equal 3.8 percent and Hispanics 17 percent because that 's their percentage of the Colorado population and that we need another ' racial bias ' study is absurd. <p> Rather than spend more money on another liberal, biased study, the whole community, including minorities, needs to concentrate on fostering healthy families with two parents and training adults to qualify for more responsible, higher paying jobs. Enough with the racial bias excuses! Enough with studies! It 's time to ' fess up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Enforcement biases <p> Thank you for your well-written and balanced article on racial disparity in Colorado 's prison system. <p> I am writing because I believe that my comments regarding drug enforcement in Boulder were misrepresented. I in no way intended to imply that Boulder is more lax in drug enforcement than the rest of the state. What I did intend to imply was that there are disparities related to how drug laws are enforced depending upon the economic status of the community in question. <p> My comments taken within context point directly toward an apparent discrepancy in how drug laws are enforced in poorer communities, like Cole or Clayton in Denver, compared to wealthier communities like Boulder. Anecdotal and statistical evidence clearly points to this. It is unlikely that an Anglo University of Colorado student will ever be randomly stopped and questioned in front of the University Memorial Center because of suspected drug trafficking. On the other hand, an African-American or Hispanic male faces a far greater chance of being randomly stopped and questioned in Northeast Park Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The economy of the drug trade is such that poorer communities bear the brunt of the war on drugs, despite the fact that levels of drug use are statistically no greater or no worse than in communities like Boulder. <p> REV. TERRANCE D. CARROLL <p> Denver <p> Please, do n't copy Boulder 's affordable housing ways <p> Re : ' Affordable housing goals urged, ' Aug. 16. <p> I hope Denver spares itself from an affordable housing program that in anyway resembles Boulder 's. While there are many absurd and ridiculous aspects of Boulder 's program, the worst, in my opinion, is relying on the estimates HUD creates for ' median income ' of a metropolitan area. <p> First, the Census Bureau generates many different estimates of ' median income, ' for example, ' median household income, ' ' median per capita income, ' ' median family income ' and so on. So far I have been unable to determine, with certainty, which of these HUD uses to create its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income. ' <p> Second, the only information currently available from the Census Bureau for the Boulder/Longmont metropolitan area for ' median household income ' is from the 1990 census. HUD takes these 1990 numbers and, using elaborate and arbitrary formulas, projects them to 2001. The further into the future they project, the greater the chance is that these estimates are in error. Third, although the numbers from the 1990 census are data pooled from both Boulder and Longmont( two very different communities), housing officials in Boulder incorrectly assume they are for the city of Boulder alone. So many people who are probably within ' 80 percent of the median income '( if anyone knew what that was) in the city of Boulder are excluded from buying ' affordable housing ' here. So, the affordable housing being built in Boulder will either be vacant for years to come or be given away to people who do n't live or work here. This should enrage the taxpayers of Boulder. It sure makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers, police and retail workers should own houses in Denver, then they should set up programs to help those professions buy houses. Stop comparing peoples ' incomes to the income standards created by HUD, which have almost no justification. <p> JAMES V. CHAVERN <p> Boulder <p> Not just for kids only <p> Re : ' Hyperactive advertising, ' Aug. 21 editorial. <p> Your concerns about the increase in prescriptions for ADHD are not valid. A big increase has come from adults being prescribed medication. It is estimated that 50 percent to 70 percent of adults continue to have symptoms as adults. <p> Your figures of 20 million prescriptions a month are suspect. First, I take two different strengths of one stimulant( fast acting and longer lasting), which doubles prescription numbers. Second, medication levels are determined by trial and error. This means one person may try three to four strengths( all of which must be reported). Also, some medications are ineffective for an individual and others must be tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in medication type and/or levels. <p> The Colorado State Board of Education clearly does not understand ADHD or its treatment. Teachers may recommend an evaluation by a medical doctor or testing by a school psychologist. They may fill out a rating scale questionnaire describing observable behaviors, but they never diagnose. Evaluations are done not only for behavior problems but also learning pro-blems. Parents can ask for free testing for their son or daughter in any school district at any time. The request must be in writing to the principal of the school. The school has 45 days to respond. <p> KAY MICHAELSON <p> Morrison <p> Responsible citizens <p> Re : ' Longtime Coloradan fed up with ' guests ', ' Aug. 8 Open Forum. <p> If Kathy Hixson has any factual basis for her thinly veiled assertion that new residents are responsible for the bulk of Colorado 's ills, I 'd like to see it. Otherwise I 'd ask Hixson to accept new Coloradans as the hardworking, responsible citizens - not guests - that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Newcomers caring <p> Thank you, Kathy Hixson, for pointing out that, when you came to live in Colorado 30 years ago, it was a perfect state. We had no trash on our streets and highways ; no aggressive, rude, impatient drivers ; no drug or violent crimes ; no horrible acts of animal cruelty ; no one taking our jobs ; and no one completely disrespecting the environment. I jumped for joy to find that out our problems were caused solely by our ' million new residents. ' <p> My **50;1849;TOOLONG Grandpa Nimrod Milton Henry moved to Colorado in 1865 and since I have more than six decades of personally living in Colorado, I do n't remember things that way. <p> I have found that people who move here are among the more considerate and caring residents and that it is usually the people who have lived here always or for what they consider a long time who cause the problems. PEGGY HARNISH <p> Lakewood <p> Brotherly love <p> I have lived here for 11 months - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day has gone by that I have n't been appalled at the rudeness of the majority of the people here. I ca n't tell you how many times in traffic I have been flipped off, honked at and actually rammed into. This was all from people with Colorado plates. <p> I do not see very much evidence of compassion or the slightest consideration for other people in this state. When I go home to Montana it 's an entirely different story. People do n't drive like maniacs( the open speed limit on highways was abolished). They are kind and say hello when they pass you on the street. <p> I, like Ms. Hixson, also have had enough and must say something. Whatever happened to brotherly love? It is precisely the people with attitudes like Ms. Hixson that I am referring to. <p> PAM HILL <p> Aurora
