3062141 <p> Rediscoveries is an occasional feature that will take new looks at old books that altered the popular culture landscapes of their times. It is written by Roger K. Miller, a former book editor of the Milwaukee Journal, who was a reporter and editor for several newspapers for more than 25 years. Now a writer for a management consulting firm, he also does freelance writing, editing and reviewing. He lives in Janesville, Wis. <p> Fifty-five years ago this month a 37-year-old Seattle-area housewife and mother of two published a book that became one of the most commercially successful first books ever, was made into a hit film that spawned a spin-off series of movies, and coined a phrase that lodged in the national consciousness for years. <p> The housewife was Betty MacDonald and the book was The Egg and I, first published in July, 1945, by Lippincott. By December it had gone into nine more printings and begun climbing the New York Times best-seller list. On Dec. 23 it reached No. 1, where it remained for 43 weeks. Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top five for another five months. Eventually the book sold more than two million copies in all editions. It is still in print as a $ 13 HarperCollins paperback today. <p> In 1947 Universal made it into a movie, for the rights to which it paid MacDonald a reported $ 100,000, starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray. And from that movie sprang a nine-picture series of popular B movies featuring two central characters from the book and movie, Ma and Pa Kettle, cranked out on the Universal back lot from 1949 to 1957. <p> And the phrase? Simply the title itself, which was cribbed for everything from jokes( mostly lame) to other book titles( ditto). A seemingly endless string of books -- The Dredge and I, The Fish and I, and The Cook and I are but three -- tried to cash in on its success. To which MacDonald commented, " I 'd rather be copied than the copier, " though in fact she was both, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronicle of several months she spent in a tuberculosis sanatorium. <p> The Egg and I, in short, ballooned into what today we would call a pop culture phenomenon, and one with sturdy legs. <p> Though it first was serialized in Atlantic magazine, the book never was expected to attain such heights and staying power ; even MacDonald family members wondered if it would sell beyond a few hundred copies. After all, it was nothing more than Betty 's account of two years she and her husband spent on a 40-acre chicken ranch they bought for $ 450 in the Olympic Mountains of Washington state. <p> But then, it was n't so much the account as the way she recounted it. The tyro author succeeded in producing a mix of bucolic sentiment and deadpan sarcasm as irresistible as it was improbable. <p> At the time she went off into the woods with the chickens, she was known as Betty Heskett. She was born Anne Elizabeth Campbell Bard on March 26, 1908, in Boulder, Colo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her family 's travels around the Western states with her mining engineer father. <p> Among the traveling family members was her " Gammy, " her paternal grandmother, an earthy and highly independent figure who sets the scene for the loopy sort of people and situations that make up Betty 's later life amid the chickens. When they lived in Butte, Mont., for instance, Gammy urged Betty and her sister to breathe in deeply the sulphur smoke from the copper smelters as she believed it " disinfected our insides. " <p> Gammy stood in complete opposition to Betty 's refined maternal grandmother, known in the family as " Deargrandmother, " who, when her father died, " came out to comfort Mother and make our lives a living hell. " <p> When Betty was 9 the family settled in Seattle. There at age 18 she met and married Bob Heskett, a man 13 years older. Heskett was an insurance salesman, but had a yen to run a chicken ranch. She writes, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his work and if Bob wanted to be happy in the chicken business I did n't care. " <p> Some 250 pages and nearly as many disasters later she has come to care : " By the end of the second spring I hated everything about the chicken but the egg. " <p> Indeed, as one travail passes the other, her book becomes a rolling dismissal of her mother 's dictum about keeping the hubby happy. This, though subtly and humorously delivered, is nevertheless fairly startling for the time. It is not too much to say that The Egg and I is a book-length example of the psychologist 's notion that a joke is a disguised form of aggression. <p> Yet, as with a joke, so with a comedy : We are meant to overlook the aggression and enjoy the humor. Which is not hard to do, right from the author 's first glimpse of her new home, looking " distressingly forlorn, huddled there in the laps of the great Olympics. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point at from car windows, saying, ' Look at that picturesque old place, ' then quickly drive by toward something not quite so picturesque, but warmer and nearer to civilization. " <p> Try as hard as she might -- from 4 in the morning till 8 at night -- to whip herself and the place into shape, she never really succeeds. The loneliness, endless work, and primitive living conditions -- you name an amenity, and they did n't have it -- prove all but overwhelming. Only two things unreservedly leave her awestruck : the beauty of nature and its bounty. <p> The Kettles, in a different way, also leave her awestruck. If you have only seen the movies, you have a distorted image of this Dogpatch-style clan, for the movies clean them up considerably. Here they are vulgar, stupid, dirty, and foul-mouthed. The one thing they have in common with their movie selves is that they are also perversely fetching, particularly Paw 's laziness, so intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn to save himself the effort of mowing it. And those who do remember the movies will find it impossible to read Paw 's dialogue without the voice of actor Percy Kilbride creeping into their heads, though in the book Pa speakth with a lithp. <p> By the end of the book 's 287 pages, she and Heskett have decided to move on to a new ranch, one with some modern conveniences. In real life, they moved on to separation and, in 1935, divorce. <p> With her two daughters MacDonald returned to Seattle and a succession of jobs, both in private industry and with the U.S. government. She spent several months in a tuberculosis sanatorium in 1938 and ' 39. <p> In 1942 she married Donald Chauncey MacDonald, a real estate agent, and they lived on Vashon Island in Puget Sound, where she wrote The Egg and I. Their life on Vashon Island was turned into another high-spirited autobiographical work, Onions in the Stew, published in 1955. That followed still another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 1950), chronicling the late Depression and early World War II years. She also wrote several children 's books. <p> In 1956 the MacDonalds moved to a cattle ranch in Carmel Valley, Calif. Two years later, again ill, she went back to Seattle for medical treatment. On Feb. 7, 1958, Betty MacDonald, whose writings over and over told how pluck and a sense of humor will make the good times outweigh the bad, succumbed to cancer, a few weeks short of her 50th birthday.
