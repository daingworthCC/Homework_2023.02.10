3039841 <p> This year 's warm, wet spring has been good news for Georgia farmers. The state 's peach crop has been judged outstanding and growers of blueberries and blackberries boast that their crops are some of the best ever. <p> Before you load up the baskets and buckets, though, follow some simple ground rules. Call before you go, and call early in the morning or after dark, because most farmers will be out in the fields working during the day. Some, however, do have answering machines which may give picking times and directions. <p> Crop availability is subject to such vagaries as the weather, hungry birds and squirrels, and the pickers who got there the day before yesterday. When you call, ask for picking times and whether to bring your own container, and get detailed directions. <p> We found morning to be the best time to pick, because it 's cooler.

Harp Farm, as well as Berry Patch Farm in Cherokee County, have pleasant picnic spots available for customers. If you do n't see a picnic spot, ask the farmer for suggestions for nearby parks or scenic spots. After a sweaty morning of peach picking in Henry County, we had a sandwich lunch on the pretty green lawn of Locust Grove 's City Hall and had time to admire the city 's Civil War cannon. On the way back from picking blackberries at Green Acres Farm in Snellville, we spotted Gwinnett County 's W.T. Briscoe Park, which has a po <p> And please remember your manners. Do n't leave empty drink containers or trash in the farmer 's fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground, and try not to break tree limbs or branches. If you 're especially nice, maybe the farmer will share a prized cobbler recipe. <p> Following is a list of pick-your-own farms within easy driving distance of Atlanta, grouped by county.
