3029641 <p> NEW YORK -- The wind whistles loudly through slightly open French doors in the palatial ninth-floor apartment of millionaire investor Steven Rattner and his wife, Maureen White. A balcony overlooks Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside, Al Gore is thanking 45 guests for sharing their wealth with his presidential campaign. <p> " It 's great to be back in your home, " Gore says to his hosts, and he welcomes guests to " the very beginning of my campaign for president. " <p> Most Americans wo n't pay much attention to that campaign for many months, but those in this room are not most Americans. They are part of an elite layer of society that is affluent and interested in politics. <p> In fact, they are among the 70,000 or so people who will give $ 1,000 to a presidential candidate this primary election season ; their money will make up more than half of the cash it takes to select a candidate in 2000. <p> These donors are being tracked down and solicited on the phone, by mail, on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Gore attended in New York on this spring evening, over white chocolate mousse with raspberries, the pledges pile up. <p> Most of the guests here tonight have agreed to raise at least $ 35,000 each. Added to the two dinners earlier in the evening, the take on this trip is $ 1.5 million. <p> Next year, the people vote in America 's presidential election. This year, the money votes. <p> Winnowing the field <p> Long before American voters make up their minds, the relative few who play the money game are winnowing the candidate field, determining who will have the money that allows them to be considered by the voting population. <p> " Money has become the first primary, " says Steve Jarding, former national political director for Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who took himself out of the presidential speculation in December. " Money now absolutely dominates as it never has before. It 's a terrible thing for democracy. " <p> More than eight months before the first primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intense. <p> This week, Gore held fund-raising events in two wealthy Washington suburbs, McLean, Va., and Chevy Chase, Md. ; in Memphis ; and in Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C. Monday, he hosts a gala in Boston, and the following week stumps for money in Orlando, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston. <p> Texas Gov. George W. Bush is using connections from his father 's presidency. Former secretary of State James Baker hosted a fund-raiser for him in Palm Springs, Calif., on May 6, and Bush 's parents are the draw at money events this month in Atlanta and in Birmingham, Ala. Elizabeth Dole has raised money in Washington, Detroit and Chicago. Lamar Alexander, John Kasich and Dan Quayle are crisscrossing the country. <p> For all of them, the purpose is the same : to raise this year nearly all of the money they 'll need for next year 's campaign. Just to get in the game, a candidate needs $ 15 million. The eventual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> The first scorecard came out last month, with few surprises. Gore raised $ 8.9 million in the first quarter of the year, and Bush pulled in $ 7.6 million, giving them large leads within their parties. <p> The money primary has always been a race, but this year 's pace is more blistering than ever. <p> " This race has turned into a 100-yard dash, and not a marathon, " says Ted Welch, Alexander 's chief fund-raiser. <p> For a generation, Americans have chosen their presidents through a system of state primaries that tests the candidates, airs their positions on issues and gradually narrows the field, building up to the party nominating conventions and then a three-month general election campaign. <p> But that system has been compressed as states pushed their primaries earlier and closer together, each vying for attention from candidates and the news media. <p> Next year, a process that once took five months will be squeezed into five weeks. California, New York, Florida, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primaries into a five-week whirl, beginning after the traditional Iowa and New Hampshire openers. It will all be over by mid-March. <p> The winners are likely to be those who raised the most money, and raised it before the first caucuses are held in Iowa. There will be no time for a candidate to score a surprise win in one state, then capitalize on it to raise money and build momentum as Jimmy Carter did in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992. <p> More than ever, candidates will appear not in living rooms and meeting halls but only as images in TV ads. With campaigns in several states at once, that 's the only way to get their messages out. <p> " If you do n't have money to get on the air, you will not be able to reach the voters, " says Terence McAuliffe, who built a legendary fund-raising machine for Clinton in 1996. <p> Nearly all the TV time must be bought by January, before it 's snapped up by competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite cash campaign are not the bowlers courted in Iowa by GOP candidate Kasich, or the basketball teams getting their photos taken with former senator and basketball star Bill Bradley, or the teachers and students Gore met on a trip to New York. <p> They are drawn from the wealthiest layer of life : entrepreneurs, corporate executives, entertainers, investors reveling in Wall Street 's boom. They are concentrated not in Iowa and New Hampshire but in such money centers as Los Angeles, Washington, Miami, New York, Houston and Chicago. One Manhattan ZIP code, 10021, was the source of $ 9.3 million in contributions in 1996. <p> For many candidates, contacts begin at home. Bush begins with a ready-made base in Texas, the state that provided the financial fuel for the presidential campaigns of Lyndon Johnson, John Connally, Phil Gramm and the governor 's father, former president George Bush. <p> Bush 's money machine follows a familiar model : Each state is organized under a well-connected leader who taps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group. <p> " You fan out, " says Tom Loeffler, a former Texas GOP congressman, now a lobbyist, who is on Bush 's fund-raising team. " No. 1, you look to the large states that are accustomed to political giving, such as Texas, California, New York, Florida, Illinois, and to the large metropolitan areas. Then you look at the leaders who have given in the past, and you look for those who are interested in being involved for the first time. " <p> For each candidate, the structure resembles a pyramid, with a finance chairman at the top and a small circle of people who will devote much of their time to soliciting their networks of social friends and business associates. Beneath them are several hundred " raisers " or " collectors, " each of whom agrees to bring in as much as $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 from dozens of acquaintances. <p> Typically, the top fund-raisers are longtime friends of the candidate. Bush 's team is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas company in Midland, Texas, who has known Bush for 30 years and raised money for his father 's presidential campaigns. Gore has turned to Johnny Hayes, a Nashville insurance executive who raised money for Gore 's congressional races, and lobbyist Peter Knight, a former Gore aide who chaired the Clinton re-election effort. <p> Competition for money is fierce. Nationwide, only 45,000 people have shown the ability and willingness to give the $ 1,000 maximum individual contribution to GOP presidential candidates. The number of Democratic top donors is somewhat fewer, perhaps 25,000. <p> Dreading loopholes <p> Would-be reformers worry that the pressure to raise money in ever-larger amounts will drive campaigns to exploit legal loopholes. Examples : <p> -- Alexander, Quayle and conservative social activist Gary Bauer established state political action committees, which are less regulated than federal PACs, to launch their campaigns last year. Such a group can finance a potential candidate 's travel and other expenses, a necessity for someone who does n't have the platform of a current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonprofit foundation that raised and spent $ 14 million promoting issues closely identified with his presidential campaign. <p> -- The Democratic and Republican parties are likely to feel freer to spend unregulated " soft money " next year on so-called issue ads that have the effect of boosting their candidates in the general election. In 1996, the parties poured $ 68 million into such TV spots. The Federal Election Commission 's staff recommended stiff fines, but the commission declined to issue any penalties. <p> " We are seeing a far more aggressive use of the alternative sources of political funding, " former FEC commissioner Trevor Potter says. He fears that candidates, seeing a new permissiveness from regulators, might try to keep their PACs and foundations active next year, adding : " If so, those who abide by the rules will be at a significant disadvantage. " <p> Leading the money race <p> Money raised as of the March 31 deadline : <p> Democrats <p> Al Gore $ 8.9 million <p> Bill Bradley $ 4.3 million <p> Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 2 million <p> John McCain $ 1.8 million <p> Gary Bauer $ 1.3 million <p> John Kasich $ 1.3 million <p> Steve Forbes $ 713,000 <p> Lamar Alexander $ 711,000 <p> Elizabeth Dole $ 686,000 <p> Pat Buchanan $ 553,000 <p> Bob Smith $ 241,000 <p> The rules of the money game <p> Limits on campaign contributions and spending, and the types of money that candidates and parties can raise : <p> Rules : <p> -- An individual may give up to $ 1,000 to a candidate 's campaign or exploratory committee during the primary season. Political action committees may give up to $ 5,000 per candidate but seldom participate at presidential level. <p> -- Federal government will match up to $ 250 of each individual contribution, up to a limit of $ 16.7 million in 2000 for each candidate. In return, candidates agree to abide by state spending limits that are based on voting-age population, and to spend no more than $ 33.5 million overall on primaries. <p> -- Candidates who decline matching funds may raise and spend as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies. Candidates who opt out of the matching system may spend as much personal wealth as they want. <p> -- Once each party has an official nominee, the general election is paid for entirely with public funds, $ 67.3 million each for the two major parties. <p> Terms : <p> -- " Hard " money : Raised and spent by candidates under the limits of federal election law, used to pay such direct campaign expenses as staff salaries, travel, polling and advertising. May come from individuals or PACs, but not corporations or labor unions. <p> -- " Soft " money : Raised by committees, including those run by parties, outside the reach of federal limits. This money can come from corporations, labor unions or wealthy individuals, but may not be spent on a candidate 's campaign. However, it may be used for " issue advertising " that can be hard to distinguish from campaign ads. <p> Key primary days in 2000 campaign <p> West Coast/Yankee primary <p>( March 7) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont <p> Western primary <p>( March 10) <p> -- Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming <p> Super Tuesday <p>( March 14) <p> -- Florida+2, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas <p> 1 - May move up <p> 2 -- May move to March 7 <p> Source : National Journal
