3032941 <p> The Education of Pervis Ellison continued recently in the equipment room at Capital Centre. It 's a tiny room, not big enough to accommodate more than a few people at a time, but with more than enough space for Coach Wes Unseld to make a point. <p> It was after the Knicks had beaten the Bullets, and after Patrick Ewing dominated Ellison, establishing position offensively and defensively. <p> The final numbers read : Ewing, 24 points, 19 rebounds, 3 blocks. Ellison had 17, 12 and 5. That kind of production from a center would have been cause for jubilation a couple of years ago. Now, it was a disappointment. <p> " Everybody had left the locker room, " Ellison recalled. " Coach called me in there. He said ' Pervis, I think you were a little hesitant in the game. When you 're out there on the floor, do n't try to be the best player on the floor, be the best player at your position. ' That 's what he wants from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and I watched the films. It was late, real late. And sure enough, even television analyst Phil Chenier said it. And when I heard him say it... it was like, two people have seen the same thing. They 've got to be right. And when I was watching the film I could see times when I was n't real intense at all on the offensive end. " <p> The coach sees it. The player does it. That 's the symbiosis that is happening now between the 6-foot-11 Ellison and his 6-7 wall of a coach. From the mind of Unseld, who lived in the NBA lane for 13 years, comes praising and cajoling and occasional screaming at the young man who gives away 30 or so pounds in the pivot nearly every night. <p> From Ellison, a variety of unique skills at both ends of the floor allow him, even as he struggles to stay above 210 pounds, to be the only center in the league to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- among league leaders in scoring, rebounds and blocked shots. <p> He 's averaging 20.8 points on 53 percent shooting from the floor, and 12.4 rebounds. It was just two seasons ago that Darrell Walker led Washington in rebounding. No Bullets center has averaged 12 rebounds a game since Jeff Ruland 's 12.3 in 1983-84. <p> He is currently second, behind Ewing, in the voting for center on the Eastern Conference all-star team. Should the former Louisville star make the squad, it would cement an incredible turnaround for the first pick of the 1989 draft, who was booed roundly at ARCO Arena by Kings fans while struggling through an injury-plagued first season. <p> Ellison " has got to realize how important he is, " said San Antonio Coach Larry Brown, who 's had to squeeze potential out of team-oriented big men such as Danny Manning in college and David Robinson in the pros. <p> " But he could n't ask for any better teacher than Wes Unseld. What more can you ask? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Much has been accomplished in Ellison 's first full year as a starter, but nothing was more important to Unseld than his demeanor and approach. <p> The coach was as angry as he gets when Ellison took in the sights of Los Angeles last season instead of getting ready to play the Lakers. The player never forgot the message. <p> " What I wanted Pervis to do was give the game the respect that it 's due, " Unseld said. " It demands it. His skills were always there. But I think it 's very important that he understands that you have to respect this game and the people in it, and prepare yourself in that manner. " <p> That means watching film. It also means giving yourself an extra hour of rest on the road, and eating right, and thinking about the opposition. And if Unseld is hard on Ellison, perhaps it 's because he knows he has one of the new prototypes in the league, a lanky big man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system -- meaning, with a 240-pounder playing next to him. <p> From the coach : " I 'm dumb enough that if there 's anything that comes up that I think about at the time, I 'll tell you. I think at this level of competition, you should n't let your feelings hurt you. You should control your feelings. I tried to explain to him that I 'm not being personal. But any way I can get you to understand what we 're trying to do, I 'll do it. " <p> The player talks about his coach by way of a story about one of the young Bullets, who was trying to guard one of the NBA 's veteran tough guys. The tough guy was having his way with the Bullet in the first half. <p> " We came into the locker room, " Ellison recalled, " and Wes said ' I 'll give you the Bullet $ 5,000 if you bump the tough guy and take the intiative. And if he retaliates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on him. ' <p> " I think he plays through us when we 're out there on the floor. " Little Big Man <p> There is something special about a big man in pro basketball. He gives his team legitimacy. The cliche about a little man not being able to dominate in the NBA has lasted so long only because it 's basically true. <p> And there 's something else. Wilt Chamberlain said nobody loves Goliath. There are different responsibilites for seven-footers and their ilk. Unlike some of their teammates, there 's no chance they can walk through an airport without someone knowing their occupation, if not their name. <p> " Pervis recognizes his uniqueness, and he carries himself very well, much more than I could explain to him, " Unseld said. " But on the court we talk about a lot of things. <p> " I told him the first day he came in. He looked at me like I was crazy. I said ' Pervis, I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it shocked the bleep out of him. You 've got to be able to play. I can show you some things that might enhance your game, try to get you to be a better professional. Because you 're not a college player anymore. There is a difference. And the players who make those adjustments are the successful ones. " <p> There were, and are, so many things. It took Unseld and assistant coaches Bill Blair and Jeff Bzdelik months to pound it into Ellison to keep the ball high overhead when rebounding, so that gnat-like guards ca n't swipe it away from below. <p> They had to pare some of his desire to pass first. No one wants a selfish player, but there 's room on the Bullets for some aggressive offensive talents. <p> Yet now, with Ellison 's success, comes the expected adjustments from the opposition, which has begun to double-team him. Though he 's an excellent passer for a big man, it 's still an adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teammates to react to it and find the open spots on the floor. <p> " We have n't had too many people get double-teamed here, " Unseld said. <p> Said Bzdelik : " He must catch the ball and not mess around with it. He still does that. You know how he gets the ball in there and makes six fakes in there? Then he 's going to dribble twice across the lane. We said ' Pervis, turn and shoot the ball quick, like Patrick does. Who 's going to block your shot in this league? ' " <p> There is, in basketballspeak, " setting the post. " That refers to a player coming down and getting into shooting position down low. For Ellison, who is 209 pounds this week and dropping fast, it 's almost impossible to come down, find a spot and keep it when a man 30 to 40 pounds heavier does n't want him to have it. <p> " What you 've got with centers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unseld said, " is that every night, you 've got size. Pervis is dealing from a deficit. Pervis has got maybe a small forward or power forward 's height, and an off-guard 's weight, and is playing center. There 's some things you have to be ready for. " <p> It was best exemplified in a recent game at San Antonio. The game was close and time was short. The Bullets went to Ellison, who had wound up being defended by Spurs guard Willie Anderson, who 's about 195 pounds. He pushed Ellison out of the lane. <p> What the Bullets want Ellison to do is constantly " reset the post. " That means coming down and turning quickly. If you do n't have position, leave the area, but come right back and set up again. If still not set, leave and reset, leave and reset. Leave and reset. <p> " If I 'm making my outside shot, the opposing player has to come out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can move, set down real quick, and establish position. What Coach is saying is that I ca n't just come down to the block and try to hold that spot. <p> " I can flash across and come back, and I can maybe hold it for three seconds. But I ca n't push the guy back. But any time I can get the guy to thinking he has to play me all over the floor, then I 'm able to move around and pick spots on the floor. " <p> You can tell if Ellison is being effective. All you have to do is count to three. If it takes him three seconds or more to do anything -- get in position, handle the ball, shoot the ball, rebound the ball -- that 's too long. <p> If he catches, turns and shoots, or comes down to one spot, and then another, and another, or passes out of the double-team in a flash, or is the backup man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion, then Ellison is likely driving the opposition crazy. <p> " Pervis is doing an outstanding job, " Ewing said recently. " He 's having a lot of good games. You 're asking the wrong man about offense, because they said I could n't score. For me, it was the opposite way. You learn how to post up better, because in college there 's a lot of zones. " Method and Madness <p> Defense, and rebounding, is more about survival than technique. Unseld has tried to let Ellison play free safety on occasion, as when he put Larry Stewart on Dikembe Mutombo in Denver, allowing Ellison to roam and block shots.( He blocked seven.) <p> The coaches have told Ellison to be the defensive bumper rather than the bumpee. He should n't let his man come down and get a spot down low. By then, it 's too late. <p> So he should initiate the contact, try to keep his man from using his lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come, because the Bullets will most likely double the opposition 's big man, anyway. <p> Ellison is n't grabbing a dozen rebounds a game because he attacks the basketball, like Charles Barkley. He is aided by long arms, even by NBA standards, and a quick " second jump, " which is the player 's ability to get off the ground again after landing. <p> It also requires a willingness to take chances with one 's body. Try this at home. Jump in the air as high as you can. Now do it again, only have someone shove you sideways as you do it. Now do it again, and get shoved, and try to catch a basketball about eight feet in the air at the same time. <p> That 's NBA rebounding, multiplied by about three times the weight and two times the height. <p> Unseld can appreciate the uncertainty of leaving the ground, only to wind up three or four feet from where you jumped. <p> " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I remember, years ago, there was Dale Schlueter. I used to look forward to it. Because there was a night I did n't have to go crazy preparing... when you had Wilt and Russell and Walt Bellamy and Zelmo Beaty and Willis Reed and Bob Lanier. " <p> And now, to contend with, there are Ewing and Olajuwon and Robinson. And Daugherty and Divac and Parish. And Laimbeer and Mutombo and Seikaly, many of whom are as quick as they are tall. New era, same problem. <p> And Ellison? <p> " I do n't see myself being on a team that 's going to be a losing team for too long, " he said. " Say I 'm wrong, but I just have that feeling. I 'm a young player. Hopefully, I think I 'll be around for a while. "
