4004441 The study of gender and culture change in an Israeli village of Moroccan Jewish immigrants reveals a paradox : although women accept men 's definition of the honorable female, one which limits women 's activities to the private sphere, women challenge this definition at least on the issue of employment outside the home. In other words, women accept the ideal image of Women conveyed by their culture, but they do not accept the behavior this ideal demands. Examination of what it means to be a man or a woman in the village and how the notion of limit manifests itself in these meanings can shed light on this paradox. <p> During one year( 1983) of participant observation and extensive interviewing, I gathered data on all the married couples( 46) of a small community in a co-operative village( moshav) in Israel. The first moshavim( agricultural co-operatives) were founded by settlers who emigrated from Eastern Europe( Ashkenazim) in the 1920s. 2 As kibbutzim, they were based on a zionist-socialist ideology but each family lived in its own house and worked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this organization. Even today the means of production are collectively bought and each member-unit sells its product through the collective. The moshav as a legal entity organizes loans to its members, which are repaid to the community. The moshav is governed democratically through general meetings, where each family( as a unit) has one vote. Decisions are taken by a majority vote. An elected committee of five members deals with daily problems. <p> The moshav I studied was categorized as economically unviable and lost its political independence. The leadership is now appointed by outside agencies and consists of five persons, only one of whom is a member of the moshav. More than half of the men earn their living outside while the women and the teenagers are in charge of the main economic feature, the chicken coops. <p> Of its 50 families, 46 are " old timers " who settled here during the 1 950s and four are " new comers. " The old timers are composed of 20 older families and 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newcomers settled in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Most( 80 per cent) of the old timer families are from Morocco, the other 20 per cent derive from Tunis, Iraq, and Yemen. The newcomers, Ashkenazim, were settled to economically redeem the collectivity by adding wealthier families. They hold different values regarding honor and identity, which incites conflicts among the villagers. <p> In this article, I focus on male and female identity as defined by separate but complementary gender-based concepts of honor, the behaviors that stem from these concepts, and the bargaining that men and women do to resolve emergent discrepancies between their concepts. As the modern world increasingly infringes on moshav life, women do not agree to accept men 's definition of women 's identity and attempt negotiation, frequently directed at redefining the concept of female honor -- and thus male honor -- in order to improve their economic situations and to gain independence from men. This effort is resisted by most men, mainly younger men, who argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community. <p> Marriage is exogamous in this community. The first sons inherit their parents ' house and rights and stay in the villages. In general, they find their wives in nearby towns. Marriage is ethnically( Sepharadic) endogamous. <p> Only six women worked outside the moshav in nearby towns ; two older women as cooks and four younger women, two secretaries, one technician and one attendant. One of these is an American married into the only Yemenite family, the three others were Moroccan in origin. The majority( 32 out of 46) of the women do not work outside their home, except to daily collect eggs from the chicken coops. Eight women work in the moshav ; five as cleaning women in the Youth Hostel, the other three women, much younger, are the kindergarten teacher, the secretary, and the educator of the moshav. RELATION BETWEEN IDENTITY, HONOR, AND LIMIT <p> This section describes the interdependence of men and women concerning their construction of self-identification. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity( see Ortner and Whitehead 1981 ; Robbins 1973 ; Ortner 1984 ; Friedrich 1977 ; Geertz 1977 ; Rosaldo 1984 ; Herzfeld 1985 ; Dominguez 1986 ; Marcus and Fisher 1986) through the issue of honor, and is followed by the specific meanings of gender identity in this culture. Gender identity in the moshav is realized through the publicly acknowledged actions of women and men when limits( constraints and boundaries) are put on their behaviors by fellow members, both men and women. <p> One 's gender identity in the moshav is formed through the needs of the other gender( by opposition and reinforcement of certain attributes). A man needs a woman to be recognized but also to feel fully a man in this culture. The woman must serve his needs and accept his domination. But as men need women to actualize their gender identity, women also need men to become women. For example, to become a mother in this culture defines the core identity of womanhood. While the process is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that are seen by the community in the actions of both men and women. Interdependence gives women some control over the codes of masculine honor and an ability to negotiate honor vis-a-vis their own needs. The ability of women to bargain men 's honor helps redefine what stands for masculinity but also indirectly is aimed at changing the women 's own self-identification. <p> The construction of identity is a dialectical pendulum swinging between personal action and public recognition( Berger and Luckman 1970). It is a dialectic of limit and continuity, the two having a reciprocal relationship. Limit and continuity are the two elements through which identity is shaped. Limit is the constraints and boundaries within which certain cultural choices are possible( Wasserfall 1987), whereas continuity transcends limits between social categories and generations( i.e., being Jewish, Israeli). However, the imposition of limits breaks continuity between insiders and outsiders and one acquires a sense of self by understanding what one is not( i.e., one is limited by not being an Ashkenazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc.). Identification occurs through the Other( Benoist 1977). <p> A culture can focus on differences( the Other) or on continuities between individuals in the process of identity formation. When a culture focuses on the Other, limits appear as a fundamental notion of cultural identity. In reference to the Other, people in that culture extract and impose limits on their own behavior and on the behavior of others. My informants placed great importance on boundaries not only between the different ethnic groups but also between men and women. Limit is both the margin beyond which behavior can not venture, and a way to confirm and/or grasp one 's own sense of identity. Where limit transcends the continuity, the other( i.e., a woman, an Arab) may become an essential part of what defines selfhood( i.e., a Jewish man). Individuals try to manipulate the criteria by which they are classified as men and women in order to change their individual identities but, given the socio-historical environments, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 8, 9). Hence, in order for gender identities to change, the pendulum must swing towards limits. In the moshav community the manipulation of honor through the imposition of limits was the means by which men and women negotiated new gender identities. 3 <p> Limit, as an aspect of identity, has both a cognitive and a behavioral as well as on the symbolic level, is a way to manipulate and bargain for one 's own identity as well as for the Other 's. Bourdieu( 1966) describes honor as a cultural component that becomes a part of the self. Manipulation of one 's identity through honor has a great impact on power relations in the moshav, as it does in various Maghrebi societies. For women and men, limits are placed on acceptable behavior in order to keep both parties honorable. Honor is publicly distributed when one behaves according to certain limits of his/her definition of being. <p> According to Friedrich( 1977), self-integrity or honor is gained through actions that sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the sense of being either a man or a woman, is realized for my informants through public acknowledged actions( Wasserfall 1987). Women answered the question " What is a woman? " by listing the actions that women do. For example, pregnancy, the action that defines womanhood. must be seen and accepted by the community in order for a woman to feel she is fully a woman. Men also emphasized the need for public acknowledgment of their male identity. When asked what it means for them to be men. they described their dominance in the public domain ; for example, the importance of having the last word( hamila haarahona) in discussions with other men, and in particular, in discussions with women. A man says, " The woman who is nothing... will try to have the last word. It is not possible ; my ego will not allow that "( aego sheli lo iafsher zoth). Domination is also the focus of men 's claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the men desire( Herzfeld 1985). " In this country you do not succeed if you are not forceful( bli coair ein cloum bamedina azoth). If I had not done what I did to those bureaucrats( shouting and ripping apart the phone line because the bureaucrats wanted to call the police) we would not be sitting in this nice house, " a professional soldier in his early thirties boasted to the admiring young men surrounding him. <p> Describing gender identity in this way is usual in Middle Eastern communities, where identity is often conceived as something one has to show( Geertz 1977:48). One is a woman( or a man, or an anthropologist, for that matter) if one performs the actions that are thought by community standards to define that identity( Rosen 1984:19 ; Abu-Lughod 1986:166). <p> All seven women who married during the year of my fieldwork became pregnant four to five months after their wedding nights. When I inquired as to this unusual timing, I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of your wedding, people will gossip and say that you got because you were pregnant, and that 's a shame but if you do pregnant after a few months, people will gossip and say that you had an abortion and can no longer get pregnant, then you are not worth anything( loshava cloum), so you better watch it. People are nasty "( rah). By manipulating the timing of the woman 's first pregnancy, a young couple shows the community that they are honorable and that each of them makes a point about his or her identity. He is a forceful man who can make his wife pregnant and she is an honorable woman who knows how to handle her husband 's courtship advances without becoming pregnant. The young man who was a professional soldier stated clearly that he chose to marry a particular girl because she did not surrender when he pressed her, so he knew that she would be reliable in their marital life. <p> Besides men 's and women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of the other gender. In the above example, the wife gained honor because her husband got her pregnant, and the husband gained honor because his wife was able to become pregnant. <p> Children provide another example of the interdependence of men 's and women 's identities. women as the core married not Bet had an another example of the interdependence of men 's and Although motherhood is understood by both men and of female identity, men present themselves as the ones who enable women 's pregnancy. For them, children are not only the proof of womanhood but especially the proof of manhood. Moreover, children are considered proof both that men are functional biologically and also that women enjoy sex. A woman can not get pregnant, my informants believed, if she does not enjoy sex. One old man explained that he could not even imagine that his wife did not enjoy sex throughout their life together because they had eleven children. " If she does not enjoy, " he added, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some women agree that to get pregnant a woman has to enjoy sex and that men must also " give them the seed "( ejaculate). The more children the woman has, the more she is supposed to have enjoyed sex, and the more honorable both she and her husband are. <p> The belief until recent times that only women could be guilty of barrenness supports men 's view of themselves as the ones who create the children and that the women are only passive containers. Men call their children " my honor, " " my pride "( hacavod sheli) and describe themselves as the creators of women 's pregnancy. Thus men provide what women understand as the epitome of the female identity. " Without it she is without function, " as one man in his late thirties put it, meaning that women 's identity depends on the will and function of men. However, women disagree with men 's presentation of themselves as in control of the timing of the pregnancy, though they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife mocked her husband 's claim that he is in charge. She said she has her own ways to make him " give her the seed. " <p> Men 's and women 's perceptions of one another help each to negotiate their own identities, doing so by putting limits on another 's behaviors. Women are important in men 's identity formation through their passive acting in who has the last word( hamila harahona). The last word is one of the actions that make a man honorable and is fully dependent on women 's compliance. Men 's life stories are full of continuous battles( ma-avakim) to be recognized as " real " men, as men of honor, men who have the last word with men. To be a candidate for the conquest of having the last word with other men, one must first dominate( shlita) one 's wife. This is not always feasible, however, for women may show their disagreement by publicly refusing to serve, by not socializing with their husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work. Men are well aware of the meanings of these protestations and answer that an honorable woman is a woman that honors her husband 's family. <p> The relationship between men 's dominance over women and their public status as honorable men was demonstrated by a dispute between two political factions in the community ; a group of old timers and the new Ashkenazi settlers who had been joined by some sons of the older settlers. In the struggle for power, the old timers spread rumors about the wife of one of their opponents, a Moroccan, in order to undermine his authority. They emphasized that the man who wanted to rule the moshav was not even able to rule his own wife, as she was seen with another man, perhaps even having an affair with him. So, they argued, how could he dare ask for leadership? <p> Men 's need for women 's compliance gives women some power, and is in fact manipulated very cautiously by women. For example, one husband, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about another man. The friend continuously emphasized his sexual potency. The man asked the braggart 's wife what she thought about it and she answered with one word " palabra "( idle talk). In this case the woman voiced an opinion that might jeopardize the man 's reputation and thus his honor, as well as reminding my male informant of his own dependency on the favorable opinion of his own wife. HONOR AS A BARGAINING TOOL <p> In this context of interdependency and a generally accepted subordinate position, women want to change their roles, and expand the definition of femininity to include the ability to earn money. Residents of the moshav, aware of women 's increasing strength in the work place and of a new definition of women 's role outside the moshav, are comparing themselves with their female relatives who live in towns( Nundi-Izraeli 1983). Because men understand their masculinity in terms of being able to provide fully for the needs of the family, they believe women 's desire to work undermines their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a will to violate the code of honor that regulates male dominance. They assume that women will be tempted to have relations with other men in the work situation. Women who want to expand their roles and redefine honorable womanhood to include earning money must redefine the honorable man as someone who does not fear his wife 's public behavior as potentially sexual, immodest, or improper. <p> Since Mediterranean societies accord honor when the community agrees that the actor does the right thing in the appropriate context to sustain his or her identity, women have developed a variety of strategies that enable them to mitigate the effects of male control( Beck and Keddie 1978:18). One of women 's responses to male domination is their subtle manipulation of male honor. Because wives can be disruptive if they do not corroborate men 's way is the guiding principle of presenting themselves, the ideology of honor through which individuals state their identities. <p> Identity changes may occur when individuals sense discrepancies between what they feel about themselves and what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an outcome of historical situations in which actors may try to change the status quo of honorable behavior to match what seems to be the best way of conveying one 's feelings. Moshav women feel that having money will not automatically lead them to misbehave as the men claim. Because they live in a context of dependency on men, however, they can only change the concept of female honor by manipulating their husband 's authority based on his honor. Acceptance of the culturally valued feminine ideals of the submissive woman may be, ironically, one aspect of women 's efforts to achieve a new identity( Dubish 1986). Women want to work because of having compared themselves with female relatives in town who improved their independence via the ability to purchase their own goods. Women who worked outside the moshav and earned money generally spent it on household goods and their children 's needs. As one man explained, spending money on goods for the house is a source of power in marital disputes and should be a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's authority. <p> Women are in a position to bargain men 's identity because of the significance placed on public reputation. Residents are very sensitive to how they are perceived by others and to what others say about them. Considerable energy is invested by moshav members in presenting or changing the presentation of a friend or a member of the family to fit their own personal interests. In the dispute between established and newly arrived settlers, the honor of the different parties was discussed at length. Some thought that M., a man in his middle forties who was well known as the source of the gossip, " should have been silent as a tomb, " while others emphasized the wife 's misbehavior and, since the community has a right to know, that M. acted properly in making it public. Moreover, a good husband and a man of honor does not make a scene with his wife in public. To do so jeopardizes his wife 's honor, since women are not supposed to publicly disagree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view, publicly insulting his wife is an indication of his dishonorable status as he does not dominate his wife. Such a man is not deemed honorable. Thus, women are led to accept the limits imposed on them by men because they preserve both parties ' honor. Women and men are markedly uncomfortable when boundaries are crossed. Women feel awkward toward men who serve their wives and show consideration to them in public. They say " it is not nice "( lo yafe). An old woman who disliked her Ashkenazi daughter-in-law, because she was pampered by her husband, whispered loud enough for me to hear, " she will step on him "( he tahaleh alav). The clear allusion was to a sexual position in which the woman is on top, which for this woman was a sign of the man 's submission. TERMS OF THE BARGAIN <p> Men and women impose limits on each other 's behavior in order to reach a mutually agreeable distribution of power and resources. These imposed limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of identity. Men in the moshav often say, " I am not a woman, " meaning that they can not perform actions like household chores that define women 's identity. Women manipulate men 's identity in their power struggle on the community level. They often discussed with one another what is to be expected from an honorable man and how women should cope with their husbands. As I sat with two married women and an engaged girl, a young man stepped in and said to the girl, " your fiance calls you. " The two women advised the girl not to move. But she went to him and they said, " tipsha! "( stupid). The fiance, by having a friend call the girl, expressed his domination and the women, aware of this, tried to prevent the girl from publicly accepting his domination. Women also discussed men 's identity in formal interviews with me and in informal situations with close friends or female relatives. This discourse was suspended when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of male adolescents. <p> M. was about to travel to buy tiles for his new house and asked his neighbor to go along. The two men were about to leave when his wife told him that she wanted to go along. She argued that since she is the one who will wash the floor, he should not choose the tiles without her. He ignored her request and sent her to the chicken coop. After going there, the resentful wife came to where I was sitting and chatted with a neighbor 's wife about husbands ' behavior. When my host 's son wanted to participate in the discussion, both women angrily told him to shut up, adding, " you will be listened to when you will be a man. " <p> Interviews with moshav women revealed that they are uncertain that they agree with the men 's definition of their identity. In particular, women express ambivalence toward their identity as mothers and as wives. Their ambivalence shows particularly in their interactions with their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cajoling. " I will kill you, " was a common statement of women trying to stop their children from misbehaving( Saunders 1981). <p> Motherhood and marriage no longer satisfy women as defining their being. As one woman in her late forties put it, " I regret three things in my life : that I married so young at sixteen, had so many children eight, and that I lived in the moshav. " Moreover, women argue that in the modern world, men do not have any basis for their need to dominate women. A woman in her early forties said, " they do not have a basis on which to rule, since a woman can now also go out and earn money. " Nonetheless, men legitimize their rule over the family by their economic support, and women, understanding that the ability to earn money and be independent are masculine qualities, feel conflict, as do men, about the blurring of limits that working outside the home entails. <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat you, does not play cards, does not drink, does not commit adultery, but works and brings money home. In all these actions, a good husband must know his limits. He is capable of being dominant, yet self-disciplined. As one young woman put it, " My two-year-old son acts like his father ; all day long giving orders. This is proper behavior. " Physical assault on women by their husbands is an ever-present possibility in this context, but a good husband knows how to dominate his wife without beating her. 4 He may, however, use other forceful behavior such as shouting, screaming, or forbidding free travel, as long as he is not violent. Wives also admire men who can bring force to bear against other men. <p> Women respect men 's verbal dominance and accept a man 's decision. What women receive in return is protection. They say, " my husband is tough "( kashuah) with pride and admiration. They admire men they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughness in a good husband, women describe the softness of Ashkenazi men, who participate in feminine household chores. Washing dishes and sweeping floors, they say, are women 's and not Moroccan men 's actions, and symbols of women 's identity. Women are particularly disturbed by Ashkenazi men who participate in such household chores publicly. One woman was shocked by her sister 's Ashkenazi husband, who washed the dishes with the women of the family while her father and all the other men of the family were sitting and drinking coffee. She especially was shocked by her sister 's willingness to let her husband behave in such a " dishonorable " way when her sister herself was also dishonored by her husband 's behavior. Ashkenazi wives, she explained do not feel protected because of their husband 's softness. 5 In private, Moroccan Jewish men may help their wives fold laundry and clear dishes, but only when they feel like doing so. The women emphasized it as a favor( tova) toward the wife. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a routine. " <p> Gambling is perceived as an especially dangerous activity for men because it tempts them to break limits ; to lose money needed by the family or become violent with their wives after gambling parties. But it is women 's responsibility as well as men 's to control men 's gambling. A few informants told me the story of a couple who gambled together and lost their chicken coop. The woman was presented as the one who destroyed her husband because she let her own passion for card-playing overcome her and did not stop her husband. As a result both husband and wife were dishonored. Drinking alcohol is also a behavior that requires an imposition of limits. An assli man, a real Moroccan, is one who can drink without getting drunk. Again, the responsibility for restraining men 's drinking falls mostly on women, who will likely be the victims of the husbands ' drunken abuse. If the man crosses these limits, he loses his honor and is seen as a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not handsome because they believe that handsome men can be charmed by other women and will be adulterous. 6 Since a good husband is faithful to his wife, choosing unattractiveness may be seen as an action which forces men to remain faithful. For the women, then, an honorable man acts neither too harshly nor too softly. Neither the Moroccan who is too harsh or the Ashkenazi who is too soft is considered honorable. The harsh man who beats his wife is feared but not honored, and the soft man, who people suspect has had to forgive his adulterous wife, is pitied but not honored. The honorable man lives somewhere between these extremes, in equilibrium and in harmony with the limits imposed by the code of honor. <p> But what are the implications and meanings of these limits in bargains regarding income and sex, the issues at the center of couples ' disagreement about women 's desire to earn money? Women do not limit men 's earning power. A good husband is expected to support his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men in this community, who are unskilled laborers and change jobs frequently. Men perceive women 's desire to earn money as a blurring of identity roles, challenging their dominance over women. One informant expressed his strong dissatisfaction with his wife 's wishes to earn money, telling me angrily that if his wife earns money, she will use it against him in their next quarrel. " She will say, ' I bought this or that. ' I would not be able to tolerate it and would divorce her on the spot. " To this man, authority as a husband meant the right to have the last word in marital disputes, based on his economic superiority. His authority was challenged by his wife 's attempts to enter his domain of power. His strong reaction to the possibility of his wife working for wages shows the importance of earning money as a means not only to increase power for both men and women, but also as a way to materialize what stands, in each party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> The significance of money for both sexes lies in its symbolic value as the currency of social exchange ; having money is symbolic of widening one 's social horizons and opening one 's self to the temptation of the outside world. Money knows no limits except its absence. Because, through his wealth, a man is believed to be self-disciplined and not in need of limitation, he can display his manliness to the wider society. A woman with money, however, is threatening to men because she is supposed to be limited, and money is a symbol of limitlessness. Her wealth is transformed in the men 's minds into the possibility of knowing no sexual limits. Hence, a woman with money challenges men 's domination of women both socially and sexually. In order to understand the relationship between sex and money and its relation to limits, it will be useful to more fully explore prohibitions on adultery. <p> In the women 's discourse, men are often portrayed as more adulterous than women because men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can afford to be adulterous, they say, because he does not " lose anything. " Women can see sex as love through the act of giving sex to the man. Men, though they may love their wives, do not necessarily make that link. For men, indulgence in extramarital sex is not an expression of love and consequently poses no disruptive social threat. When men behave as if loving, women seek an explanation akin to witchcraft ; namely, the other woman cast a spell. " A man loves his family ; he will always come back, " said a woman in her forties. According to women, an adulterous woman will not return to the family because, for a woman having intercourse means she loves. Both men and women believe that " only sex links men and women "( raq min cosher teen bne zoug). An adulterous woman sees love as the main motive for women 's adultery, while, for the men, sex is the only motive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their honor. As one man in his thirties said, " An unfaithful man is a manly man "( hahla " ever, " ever alkefek). Men have affairs to express their dominance and virility. Since men do not associate sex with love, just as they are self-disciplined with money, they know how to manage sex without being excessive. A few younger women want to limit men 's sexual freedom. As one woman in her late twenties said, " If my man is unfaithful to me in sex today, tomorrow he will betray me. " However most women hold the attitude that only men should experience sexual encounters outside marriage. <p> Women must be limited sexually, claimed my informants, because they cognitively link sex and love. They supported this assertion with anatomical evidence. A man makes a woman love him, they said, by penetrating her. He pushes her " limit " and, from now on, can limit her behavior. Because women are unable to discipline their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them, so that they will not abandon their families, thus breaking the normal social structure. " The woman is weak "( halasha), said one woman in her forties, " not like the man. If he commits adultery he will come back, she will not. " <p> Men see in an adulterous woman the sign that her husband does not dominate her sexually. " A woman who has what she needs will not be adulterous, " said a man in his late forties. " If she is adulterous, it means that she needs affection ; if she had affection and still has an affair, it means that she is sick "( hola). According to the men, unfaithful women destroy their husband 's honor. Working situations in particular are seen as opportunities to have sex. Men continually asked my male research assistant " if we were going to marry. " Once, when he answered that I was already married, a man teased him, saying, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and do not have sex together? " Men fear that women 's efforts to earn money is a sign of their desire to meet other men and to have sexual affairs. This fear is validated by their feeling that perhaps older women, who are no longer sexually attractive, should be allowed to work. An elderly father, after hearing his son say that he never would agree to his wife going out to work, exclaimed, " What! You are crazy. When she will be old she can go out to work. Who will want her? " The son. however, more acutely aware of the threat of modern ways and the blurring of categories, disagreed with the father, saying, " In those things wives working I am a primitive. " <p> Men often tell their wives stories of affairs going on in their work situations and women have mixed feelings about this boasting. One woman complained, but was also proud of her husband 's jealousy. She told me that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work because his boss asked him to let her work as a secretary in the office. He suspected his boss of being romantically interested in her, she said. <p> From the women 's point of view, an adulterous woman is pushed by her misbehaving husband into the arms of another man who will be able to understand her needs and behave toward her in such a way that she will feel like a real woman who is protected by a man. At the same time, other women sympathize with adulterous women because they are not dominated by their husbands, calling them " poor ones "( miskenot). When the husband is too harsh and does not give enough warmth to his wife or when he is too soft and does not control her behavior, women will say he deserves his wife 's disloyalty( magia lo). <p> Women 's ambivalence about the meaning of female adultery -- that women should be protected by men and deserve affection -- parallels their views regarding their own earning activities. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break limits, to challenge men 's economic domination, but they agree that limits have to be imposed on them by men so that they will feel secure. As one woman in her late twenties said, " My man looks after me "( Hagever sheli shomer ali). Still, women want to earn their own money as a means of gaining independence from their husbands. <p> In an effort to resolve their ambivalence about working outside the home, women have constructed a discourse about Ashkenazi male softness in their attempts to bargain over their husbands ' identities. According to women, the Ashkenazi male image is negative in the sense that he is not tough enough, and therefore his wife does not feel protected. However, it is also positive because the Ashkenazi man does not suspect his wife of being adulterous when she works outside the home. Women complaining about husbands ask why Ashkenazi men do not fear their wives having affairs. <p> Men portray the Ashkenazi man as naive, not suspicious like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say, that makes him fear betrayal and cheating in all spheres of social life. One man described, in French, the difference between Moroccan and Ashkenazi : <p> The problem of the Moroccan is suspicion, if someone from the Haeda( ethnic group) wants to help, everyone suspects that he wants to help for 0a own interests. If an Ashkenazi man comes and says exactly the same as the Moroccan, he is a good man. The Moroccan man does not believe the other Moroccan. For example if 1, a Moroccan, come and say to someone " Listen, I think your son has fleas,. the Moroccan will answer, " What, my son, fleas? It is not possible, go away, you are against me! " If an Ashkenazi will come and say exactly the same thing, the Moroccan will say, " Thanks. Maybe you know how to cure this.. The Moroccan is cunning( Armoumi), the Ashkenazi is straightforward, so the Moroccan believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid of the Ashkenazi. <p> Because Ashkenazim are thought to be sincere and straightforward, Moroccans fear other Moroccans who are suspicious and deceitful more than they do Ashkenazim. Men exploit this image to explain hashd anout( suspicion) between men, while women use it to explain their husbands ' suspicion of themselves. <p> In so doing, women hope to soften the harshness of the Moroccan man by applauding the Ashkenazi man who is not afraid his wife will have affairs when she goes out to work. By introducing this aspect, however, women must confront the discomfort they feel with the Ashkenazi model. They, too, are somewhat persuaded by Moroccan men 's claims that Ashkenazim are naive and will be outsmarted by the more clever and cunning Moroccan, and even that the Ashkenazi women do not feel protected by the Ashkenazi men. Moroccans claim they are suspicious because they understand the real dangers embedded in situations. The difficulty for women, then, is that in their attempts to gain access to money, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ashkenazi man, which they find uncomfortable. A CULTURAL GENDER IDENTITY CRISIS <p> Although women continue to believe that they are defined by their behavior in the private sphere and men by their actions in the public sphere, the opportunity to improve their economic situation has prompted them to challenge this ideal in practice. Women attempted to justify a change by redefining male honor so that the honorable man need no longer express total economic dominance in the family and, by redefining female honor, rejected the notion that work relationships with men other than their husbands would lead to adultery. In order to redefine their situation, women use some attributes borrowed from their conceptualization of the relationships between genders among the Ashkenazim, with whom they have daily interactions in the moshav and in the broader society. The notion of Ashkenazi softness is the operative principle by which women try to manipulate their husband 's honor and identity in regard to earning money. However, because women themselves are uneasy about the blurred male/female gender role and identity that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in changing their husbands ' point of view at the time of the research. The metonymy relations between love, sex, and money, as all of these terms entail the notion of limit, leave the women feeling ambivalent about change. By manipulating their husbands ' self-definition while accepting a cultural conception that for women links money and sex, and sex to love, women find themselves in a dilemma. They need to change cultural understanding of what sustains their femininity but, in so doing, they risk losing the power invested in that femininity. <p> In this analysis, the social maneuvering for power by women is interdependent with the symbolic manipulation of what it is to be an honorable man. Almost every woman said she would like to work for money in the moshav itself since this would give her a way to earn money while remaining under the vigilance of men and thus avoiding any possible suspicion of sexual misconduct. Although men accept this arrangement, they view women 's work as a luxury and say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, women who are employed continue to perform all the housework, just as they did before they began to work for money. One young woman quit her job in the childrens ' house after a few days because she was exhausted. Her husband, she noted, was very happy that she did not succeed. <p> Women 's ambivalence concerning the issue of money and women 's limits helps explain why women in fact do not succeed in negotiating male identity in order to allow the female identity to include economic self-sufficiency. In fact, earning power becomes a threat to their identity because it jeopardizes their sexual morality in the eyes of men. <p> The potential for change is mitigated by the fact that the youngest men are the most intransigent about their wives going out to earn money. Thus, although there are now work opportunities for women outside the moshav, conceptions of femininity and masculinity have not yet changed. Paradoxically, without a change in these conceptions of identity, the work roles of men and women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paradox in which moshav women agree with one set of meanings conveyed by a culturally constructed gender identity, but do not accept the behavior this identity demands. The notion of limit is part of a broader conceptual framework which includes bargaining for identity and continuity. <p> The discourse on women 's identity presents women as boundless, limitless in their love. Consequently, they are unable to discipline themselves regarding sex and, by extension, money. The discourse on men 's identity describes men as knowing their limit where love is concerned, so they are also able to discipline themselves regarding sex and money. Because of these different conceptions of how limits shape gender identity and thus determine what are honorable behaviors on issues of money, love, and sex, women have been unable to change men 's identity to make it socially acceptable for them to earn money. <p>
