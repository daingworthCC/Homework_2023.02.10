4080141 Wow, what a week of excitement! The Photographic Society of America( PSA) celebrated its 75th anniversary with an outstanding conference and the most attendees in several years, totaling 617. There were 203 First Timers, an absolutely huge number that accounted for over one third of the conference attendance. This was the largest attendance since Colorado Springs in 1994. Flags of 15 countries were displayed in the main exhibition room in recognition of the 65 attendees from those countries. Could it be due to the fact that the conference hotel was only one mile from the entrance to Yellowstone National Park? There were 35 tours that took PSAer 's into the park and close attractions beyond. The tours left early and stayed late in many instances to capture the early morning and late afternoon light as well as the animals in their most active state. The tours included Oxbow Bend in Grand Teton National Park, Old Faithful. Yellowstone Canyon, West Thumb and Hayden Valley, Midway Geyser Basin. Mammoth Hot Springs, Madison River and Firehole Falls. One tour that left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzly bear. More of the images that were captured included otters feeding in the river, an eagle and her immature offspring feeding near their nest, bulk elk and his harem of cows, moose, coyote, deer, chipmunks, and various others. A black wolf crossed the road rapidly near Oxbow Bend but was very elusive in his search for food. The plentiful geysers provided an interesting backdrop in the early morning light as well as many pleasing images at any time of day with their hot spewing waters glistening in the sun. The weather could n't have been better providing great lighting conditions at many hours of the day. The fall color at Oxbow Bend enhanced the picturesque scenery and the reflections added much impact to the images. The bull elk at sundown in the field with 12 cows provided many with a golden opportunity to capture the nature story of the fall season. Three otters fed in the river in great morning light for almost 45 minutes to provide many photographers with the opportunity to capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-mile backup on the park road, where the park ranger had to conduct traffic calls! The eagle was another big attraction when it stole a fish from the immature eagle feeding on its catch. After much squawking, the adult prevailed!
