4011841 The Uruguayan coup of 1973, like those of other countries in the Southern Cone, signified not only the interruption of the constitutional, liberal-democratic state, but also the total dislocation of national cultural life. 1 In previous decades, the humanist, Europeanized and anachronic official culture languished, confined to its role as referee( in the final analysis, financial referee) between the state 's ideological apparatus and other culture-disseminating institutions. 2 The autonomy of the State 's cultural policy had been reduced to the worn-out repetition of pompous rites established in other, prosperous times, so the State exercised its hegemony in collusion with and subordinate to the increasingly( directly or indirectly) foreign-controlled private mass media. 3 This connivance intensified the process of acculturation, understood -- in the well-established Latin American sense of the term, which rejects the very vague definition by Robert Redfield, Ralph Linton and Melville Herskovits -- 4as a compulsory cultural penetration, through the use of a more advanced technology, which imposes foreign models, erases heterogeneity, and deprives the subaltern culture of its distinctive traits. 5 <p> The intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian sense of the word, and not in Mannheim 's -- ' an authentic intelligentsia, which pervaded and regulated instruments such as the university, the theater, plastic arts and publishing companies. 7 This intelligentsia, in alliance with popular sectors and making use of the ruptures of the State, promoted very dynamic cultural manifestations which rivaled and entered into open conflict with fossilized official culture and the pervading mass media. This determined a highly explosive dual contradiction : 1) between the theoretically omnipotent political apparatus and its( in-) capacity to hegemonize culture ; and 2) between an officially blessed acculturizing mass culture and a politically driven popular culture rooted in folkloric traditions, intended as an alternative counterculture. <p> Although the term " popular culture " is extremely ambiguous and all definitions are deficient and limiting, it is necessary to make a distinction between popular culture, folklore, and mass culture. While all of them compete for the same public, they are produced( emitted) by different social classes and through very diverse means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by the mass media, which are controlled by powerful corporations usually related to foreign capitals ; folklore -- or culture of the people -- originates among the consumers themselves( use value) ; 8 and popular culture is produced by professionals, generally pertaining or related to middle-class intellectuals( establishment or intelligentsia), who premeditatedly choose and elaborate certain messages directed at molding the collective imaginary of those popular masses. 9 Of course, there are no clear-cut boundaries on this continuum between mass culture and folklore, and though popular culture can express very diverse ideological orientations, in the Uruguayan context it is possible to apply Mattelart 's definition : <p> Between mass culture and popular culture is the distance that separates the system whose legitimacy is founded upon the subjugation of conscience and a system in which the " masses " cease to be the submissive spectators of a representation contrary to their interests and become the active subject of cultural experience linked to their own project of liberation. 10 <p> Obviously linked to Gramsci 's concept of people-nation, 11 this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted by the intelligentsia during the ' 50s and ' 60s that contributed to the uprooting of the State 's foundations. <p> It is then that the military bursts onto the scene. Faced with the undermining of its superstructure and at the verge of political collapse, the State reacted through terrorism and the implementation of fascist-modelled cultural policy. The critical necessity of the military regime to silence all dissident manifestations was complemented by a strategy designed to manipulate and mold cultural standards according to its own ideological parameters, which, briefly stated, are : 1) an ultra-nationalist discourse articulated around the " Doctrina de la Orientalidad " Doctrine of Uruguayanism, at odds with the open sell-out of the country through the neo-liberal economic policies of the " Chicago boys " ; 2) the Armed Forces as the core and last resource of nationhood ; 3) the absolute hegemony of mass media and other channels of communication ; 4) a strict ideological-cultural verticality ; 5) the militarization of civil society ; 6) the National Security Doctrine as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism both as an unifying ideology and a smoke screen) was implemented through totalitarian control over organizations disseminating information and culture, and by exiling or imprisoning numerous artists and intellectuals, which generated the virtual decapitation of the intelligentsia. At the same time, the regime carried out an ineffective campaign to recruit cadres of its own while it also regimented all levels of the educational system. Although mainly unsuccessful in modelling a new social imaginary, and in thus expanding its social base, the institutional rupture of 1973 led to the fragmentation of Uruguayan society into three groups : the imprisoned, the exiled, and the insiled. Insile -- or exile within the country 's borders -- refers to the relationship of the individual with a power legitimized through obedience and terror. 13 <p> Although the impact of prison experience would be made a social one after the amnesty of 1985, during the years of state terrorism it could only be felt in a ghostly manner, as an implied, ever-present taboo in a divided reality. The other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators of the period 's cultural production. 14 <p> The culture of exile, nurtured by well-known artistic and intellectual figures, would find itself struggling to survive amid nostalgia for the place( home) snatched from them, the violent contact( permeation, assimilation) with other cultures, and desolation in light of the catastrophic collapse of the ideomyths that had sustained an arcadian, Europeanized, civil state, that " model country " designed as a refined system for the absorption of social contradictions. 15 An imaginary Uruguay had exploded into pieces under the pressure of reality : the " Switzerland of America " had turned into a distant, poor, and dearly loved " little country. " 16 <p> In contrast to the culture of exile, the study of countercultural production from within the daily matrix of insile takes on particular relevance. Under the regime of terror 's asphyxiating machinery, the insiled dissociated him/herself both psychologically and socially and became adapted to an omniscient and omnipresent system of violation. State terrorism generates a " mysticism of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination, since it shifts the thresholds of control beyond the point where power truly reaches. This is due to the involuntary complicity of the victim, who, surviving at " the limits of transgression, " becomes encapsulated and overwhelmed, and then feeds into his/her own alibis for being afraid. 17 <p> This is the climate in which the " generation of silence " develops. This generation, alienated by the culture of terror, cut off from models and teachers, deprived of the collective memory of arcadian Uruguay, will seek to find its own image in the interstices of unanimous silence. From this emerges the phenomenon of canto popular, the period 's richest cultural experience : <p> Canto popular presents itself as a music based on rural or urban folkloric roots, with high quality poetic texts, and as a search for unadulterated popular song, expressing itself above all through the singer of ballads. Its open stylistic linkage with the protest song of previous generations shows it to be a musical phenomenon still pertaining to an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continental phenomenon of nueva cancion new song, 19 retains its own particular characteristics. According to Behague, the nueva cancion <p> tended generally toward the stylized, urban rendition of folk genres rather than the commercial, international pop styles fashionable in industrialized societies of the period. Song texts were meant to express and promote the ideology of the socialist political movement, involving primarily the expression of nationalist independence, populism, and the consequent criticism of foreign exploitation and domination. 26 <p> Canto popular, however, although sharing some of these features, and despite the efforts to highlight its continuity with the ' 60s classics( a reverent mention, a coded allusion, as well as explicit intertextuality in repertoires and arrangements), 21 is a virtual orphan. It differs from the protest song in that it does not originate under the auspices of a popular political-cultural wave, 22 but rather under the most adverse conditions of repression and censorship which are naturalized by the everydayness of insile, " where living under a military dictatorship had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal discomfort. A normal cancer. " 23 These factors determine not the registering of a rousing or propagandistic political message, but rather the formation of an agglutinative( ideological and liturgical) socio-cultural gathering for young people deliberately disintegrated and kept on the margins of historical process. From this develops canto popular 's main task : the creation of a new imaginary, an authentic counterculture, an alternative to the compulsory acculturation fomented by the military regime 's submission to foreign influence. 24 <p> The faltering and difficult beginnings of almost underground groups and concerts built up, step by step, a fair number of musicians and poets who would seek to open up spaces for communication, necessarily dysfunctional with respect to hegemonic culture, with a young, urban, middle-class public. 25 Nineteen seventy-seven, considered the " year of resurgence, " marked the launching of numerous concerts and shows combining both music and theater. 26 In the years following, new artists were constantly added, and concerts multiplied to the point of market saturation in 1979-80, culminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 that took shape as a sort of ritual exorcism of the discourse of power, a rite of initiation in the pathos of the masses. As a young spectator says : <p> There was a communication problem we were suffering from, and somehow, maybe not totally, it helped us socially to go out a little, to go out after listening in secret to a record in your house, maybe not with direct political lyrics, but that still insinuated something and all of that meant a lot in Canto Popular... and to a degree, too, everything that had to do with the fervor, the atmosphere all those people together creates in you, a certain spirit in common, you found it there and that 's all. 28 <p> As much musically as poetically, canto popular is an aesthetically heterogeneous and eclectic movement, 29 an experimental compendium of genres, where diverse variations of rural folklore, the urban sources of the tango, the candombe and the murga, vernacular jazz and rock, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, even when the musical framework shows great creativity and vigor, the text is considered the principal axis of the song : " We have always been interpreters, vehicles for the projection of sung texts ". 31 The act of communication, the un-repeatable instance of utterance, is the distinctive feature of canto popular. Similarly, the movement operates as a heterogeneous unity, 32 organized in " work groups " in which artists participate on collective projects while each maintains his/her own individuality. 33 There is a permanent exchange of artists which makes each show or recording a unique product, and this underlines, in its very mode of production, canto popular 's nature as metaphor for class alliances that keep up resistance to the dictatorship. <p> But although canto popular 's main goal is, then, the reconstruction of the collective memory and, through it, of national identity, several strategies can be distinguished. This paper will introduce some of the most significant ones, through a brief examination of three hit songs.( Complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) " A redoblar " " Roll the Drums " : Remaking the Future34 <p> Of all the urban folkloric rhythms reclaimed by canto popular, those from carnival stand out, especially the candombe, of remote African origin, and the murga, which stems from the Cadiz carnival. 35 The murga is a group of twenty to thirty members who sing and dance, with a rudimentary but characteristic choreography, and who are accompanied by percussion instruments : drums, cymbals, and bass drum. The classic staging of a murga includes an introduction, songs, and farewell. By extension, such compositions, their rhythms and vocal harmonies constitute the genre. <p> Some of the most successful ' 60s protest songs were based on murga, but around 1980 a murga explosion occurred. Some reached recording studios and, thus, numerous murgas and " antimurgas " emerged but not as part of the commercial carnival circuit. 36 The murga 's success is due to its enormous aesthetic malleability. Indeed, it is an under-coded genre whose loose structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, harmony, pitch, and choreography without diminishing its " murguistic " quality. Another factor in its success is carnival itself : <p> Carnival fascinates because of its unprejudiced, critical and satiric language and its permanent dynamic( which brings together in itself almost all art forms) and because it has been both a witness and a scourge for Montevideo 's conservative cultural system. 37 <p> The mere choice of murga as the mode of expression is a statement in and of itself. This is particularly noticeable in " A redoblar " by Mauricio Ubal and Ruben Olivera, which immediately after its 1980 release, became a hymn of resistance to the dictatorship. The song reflects traditional murga staging in its structure, that is : introduction, songs, and farewell. The introduction, written in the future tense, stresses the certainty of joy or, in other words, the proximity of a true carnival, in opposition to the present masquerade( **33;204;TOOLONG cardboard). The songs are patterned in three stanzas that reiterate the title 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a summons, an exhortation, a shout in an absolute present( " tonight ") projected onto the future. The verb " redoblar " has three possible -- and metaphorically interrelated -- meanings : to roll the drums, to redouble( as in efforts), and to bend something over. The first stanza combines the meanings of rolling the drums and bending over( their shadows, their astonishment), in order to banish present( false) reality. The second stanza concentrates on the beating of drums( carnival drums, war drums?) but the trucks of the night allude to the nocturnal, political and clandestinely written graffiti as well as to the itinerary of the mourgas from one street stage to another, with the city itself forming the backdrop. In the third stanza the meaning is to redouble hope, accentuated in the beating of blood and heart, as drums in the city. So, the three meanings of " redoblar " oscillate and combine to empty out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), two parts( the introduction and the songs), and two tenses( the denied past and a welcome future), converge and become superimposed, redoubling the meanings while, supposedly, the murga departs. " Brindis por Pierrot " " Toast by Pierrot " : Nostalgia for the Past38 <p> While " Roll the Drums " seeks, in a squandering of militant optimism, to reconstruct the collective imaginary in favor of the future, Jaime Roos 's song clings to the shreds of a mythified( and mystified) past. His work, arranged around the commonplace of ubi sunt, is an elegy for the absent, vanquished protagonists of a lost world. The song evokes characters, events, and places in the geography and mythology of carnival in manner reminiscent of the tango. It alludes bisemically to the exile and to the loss of referential norms in a disrupted society. Those who have left and those who keep on leaving for whom carnival evokes " this night for remembering " through its vicarious street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arcadian Uruguay thai has left( disappeared) with them. <p> Thus, the text operates on the deep layers of a dormant collective memory, entrenched in minuscule events from the tabloids and obscure neighborhood characters. The song 's rendition by the murga " Falta y Resto " and soloist Canario Luna, whose voice pitch, diction, and inflections immediately immerse the audience in the carnival atmosphere, evokes the symbolic recuperation of life on carnival 's stages. <p> Roos, making use of the cyclical ritual of carnival and its popular urban mythology, proceeds to reconstruct a topos place. And even though he may not mean to propose this, this topos is projected onto an imaginary cronos time. Nostalgia( of both exiled and insiled) for their lost city implies the desire to regain a time and a society that refer to the utopic and uchronic " Switzerland of America. " Nostalgia, in this way, sets a trap that enervates historical conscience : <p> The past is revitalized and is more present than real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, an isotope of " real " identity. Hope, prohibited for a future that no longer exists, is directed toward the reconstruction of the past, in whose phantasmagorical mythology, the significance of its own existence finds an echo. 39 " La leyenda de la metamorfosis perpetua del principe ogro " " The Legend of the Perpetual Metamorphoses of the Ogre Prince " : The Wheels of History40 <p> Leo Masliah, in a manner quite different from previously mentioned composers, does not build on folkloric patterns, but rather on unconventional poetic and musical ones. His scores flirt with atonalism and minimalism, while his " mesopoetry " fuses black humor, the absurd, the grotesque, and " concrete poetry. " Music and text, instead of blending together, work as a contradictory composite at once irritating and explosive in which ' noises " become messages. <p> In the text under analysis, the power of the State-ogre prince resides in its extraordinary capacity for mutation, permitting the adoption of the most diverse forms depending on historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " presumed distiller of virtues " can " dye his aristocratic blue blood the color of the venom of the emerald serpent of South America " and return to his " original form of mean ogre. " Cyclical time that erases memory combines with a denunciation of social alienation to reveal the true nature of a State power that reiterates Latin American history by means of an intertextual allusion to Nicolas Guillen 's " Sensemaya. " The " Legend... " is thus an allegory of the State that presides over Uruguayan history, its partial accomplishments and endemic frustrations, which, in a " gattopardesque " exercise of power, yet again, " returning to his past " becomes the paladin of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The lure of a " return to normality " is, for Masliah, a Machiavellian transmutation which, under the supposed restoration of constitutional rule in 1985, restores conformity to a structurally unmodified status quo. The hegemonic power of a plagued and discredited State disguises itself in resorting to the ideomyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The " Legend... " condenses the possibilities and limits of Masliah 's " mesopoetry. " The text 's density, its monotonous lexical accumulation, the syncopated rhythm, as well as Masliah 's metaphorical fireworks and irreverent use of chiche, clearly exceed the limits of the popular. The text 's images, although commonplace, are given new dimensions through their interweaving in a structure controlled by a highly intellectualized concept of history. <p> The fusion of music-lyrics is perfect, but in order to achieve this perfection Masliah has reduced the musical score to a minimum : an enervating rhythm and a chorus-commentary underline the irritating textual bombardment, while a stereophonic counterpoint multiplies the voices, creating an illusive and mobile dimension in which the listener wanders. Conclusions <p> In spite of their differences, these three songs( strategies) pertain to the same cultural phenomenon, are nurtured by the same socio-political climate, and aim for the same goals. They do not relate to any particular political discourse, but are extremely political nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they arose in the margins of culture as artistic expressions of resistance to hegemonic fascist discourse, and as such, as a counterculture. They performed a cohesive socio-ritual role among the new generations and, finally, they provided overlapping answers to the following questions : What is national culture? If it exists at all, where are its roots? What is the role of popular culture in sustaining collective memory and reshaping the social imaginary? <p> " A redoblar "( 1980) coincides with the high point of popular resistance, of which it became a hymn. It relies on carnival 's popular essences as a tool to dismantle the meshes of insile. ' " Brindis por Pierrot "( 1985) expresses nostalgia for a mythified past -- a refuge from the present -- as a late expression of insile under the dictatorship. " La leyenda... "( 1985), projecting itself into the future implications of the present return to democratic rule, warns us of the lures of a collective memory destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that canto popular, born under severe socio-political constraints, starved to death with the return to liberal democracy. Its reason for being disappeared along with the military regime, precisely because canto popular was born to resist dictatorship, to embody counterculture, and to ritualize hope. In fact, democracy destroyed a movement that had endured and thrived under fascism. This paradox leads us to a final question : What are the paths of an alternative popular culture under democracy? That, too, is another story. <p>
