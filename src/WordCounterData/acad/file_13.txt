4002241 When the topic of Junior Achievement arises in conversations among business people or educators, many recall its after-school community program in which teenagers crafted products to sell. This business education program, called the JA Company, has, since 1919, attracted several million of America 's youth. <p> Nearly two decades ago, however, the face of Junior Achievement began to change. In 1974, Junior Achievement 's first in-school economic education program, Project Business, was introduced to students in grades 7 to 9. Business Basics, a program for fourth- to sixth-grade students, followed in 1978. Then, in the early 1980s, the organization 's flagship curriculum, Applied Economics, was launched for high school students in tenth to twelfth grade. After several pilot editions of the one-semester course, the first edition of Applied Economics was published in 1985. <p> Twenty years ago, few people could have predicted how dramatically those programs would change Junior Achievement. Although the original JA Company program is still going strong, each year it represents a smaller segment of the Junior Achievement program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all students involved in Junior Achievement. And just like the JA Company program, in-school programs feature a volunteer from the community, called a business consultant, who works with students. In addition, all Junior Achievement programs are sponsored by the business community at no cost to schools. <p> Today, Junior Achievement has eight economic and business education programs available for young people( see sidebar). The articles that follow in this special section of The Social Studies describe several teachers ' experiences with three of Junior Achievement 's more popular programs : Applied Economics, Project Business, and the new K-6 Initiative. The last, which currently is being developed, is an expansion of the Business Basics program. Business Basics <p> During the 1991-92 school year, nearly 400,000 U.S. elementary school students, a majority of whom were fifth graders, participated in Business Basics. In four highly engaging lessons, these students learn what it takes to organize a business, make management decisions, manufacture a product, and market it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant-a local business person, college student, or student from the high school program. The consultant serves as a role model for the children and draws on his or her business or student company experiences to lead students in problem-solving activities, role-playing exercises, and lively discussions. The consultant and the student use the colorful, engaging materials that are enriched with readings from a newspaper-style Business Journal. <p> However, Business Basics is being supplanted by a new program in which the new K-6 framework, Business Basics, will be retooled as the fifth-grade component. <p> K-6 Initiative <p> Soon kindergarten through sixth-grade children will study how businesses, workers, and consumers carry on economic fife in their local, state, national, and international communities. They will learn concepts and skills at each grade level that build on those taught in preceding grades. Programs for grades one, two, and three have been developed and are being field tested in selected cities across the nation. Judith Lee Swets, a second-grade teacher from Grand Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the How Does A Community Work? program. <p> The K-6 elementary school program takes a conceptual and sequential approach to learning. It recognizes that people, as contributing members of society, assume roles as an individual, worker, and consumer and carry out these different roles in an expanding environment that extends from the self to global relations. This new program includes a variety of activities that help young students develop appropriate decision-making and workforce-readiness skills. Project Business <p> Approximately a half-million students each year participate in Project Business, Junior Achievement 's most popular program. Deeni Schoenfeld, who wrote the article about her eighth-grade class in Walnut Creek, California, is one of about 15,000 teachers who work with Project Business. <p> Key to the success of Project Business, as Ms. Schoenfeld recounts, is the cooperative effort between the business consultant and classroom teacher. The consultant brings an economic and business lesson to the students each week of the semester, but the teacher sets the stage for the consultant 's visits. In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For their preparation and presentations, consultants use a detailed program guide that allows them to choose among a variety of hands-on activities for each class period. <p> A popular feature in the Project Business curriculum is The Wizards of Sound, a twenty-two-minute video field trip about the recording industry. This video follows students from Junior High School 22 in New York City as they travel to CBS Records ; meet trumpeter Wynton Marsalis ; help mix sound tracks for a recording ; see how records, tapes, and compact discs are manufactured ; and discuss marketing techniques with CBS executives. <p> Economics of Staying in School <p> This supplementary program is a series of four activities that the program 's business consultant uses to show at-risk students the relevance of what they learn in school to life in their economic society. The first activity is " Success, " a board game that teaches students the long-term benefits of a high school diploma and further education. " The Benefits of Staying in School " demonstrates to students the economic advantages of educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In " The Cost of Dropping Out, " students use local classified ads to look for work and prepare a personal budget based on wages they might earn without a high school diploma. " Facing the Issues " is a role-playing activity based on situations faced by someone who has dropped out of school. <p> Applied Economics <p> In my early days as a high school economics teacher, I envisioned teaching an entire course built on a framework of experiential learning that might consist of classroom simulations, student debates, and field trips into the community. With the Applied Economics program, teachers find that such a curriculum is now available to them. <p> The research on Applied Economics, taken from external evaluations conducted at three-year intervals, reveals that the program 's active learning components are its most effective. The teacher( who conducts the course four days a week) and the consultant( who visits on the fifth school day) can introduce students early in the semester to the Student Company, an activity in which students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm. This might be followed by the Management and Economic Simulation Exercise, or MESE, a computer-based microeconomic simulation. <p> Applied Economics students could advance to Macroland during the latter part of the semester. In this computer simulation, they would assume the roles of government economic policymakers and Federal Reserve Board members in managing a national economy through fiscal and monetary policy. Mark Sperling, in an accompanying article, describes his use of MESE and Macroland with students at Cass Technical High School in Detroit. <p> The hands-on learning does not end with these activities. The student study guide, for example, contains many exercises that reinforce the concepts, generalizations, and other information introduced in the text. The program guide also offers a range of activities to engage students intellectually in problem solving and critical thinking. <p> Many Applied Economics classes examine current economic issues, such as teens in the labor force, the health-care crisis, and the new European Community 1992, through Talks to Teachers. This quarterly publication is an eight-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic. <p> To assess class as well as individual progress during the semester, teachers can administer two forty-five-item pre- and post-tests of equivalent scope and difficulty. These tests are provided with the curriculum, and many teachers use them extensively. During the semester, teachers can generate end-of-chapter or -unit exams from a computer database of over 400 items. Finally, Applied Economics comes with a 100-item final exam that covers all the topics studied in the course and represents different levels of difficulty. <p> AE Rural Expansion and AE-by-Satellite <p> Through a delivery system tailored for small cities and towns, Applied Economics now is reaching many more rural school districts throughout the country. This system uses video tutorials to explain the program to school administrators and to train classroom teachers and business consultants. In turn, Junior Achievement works with the school superintendent to obtain business support for Applied Economics. This rural expansion project was initiated in 1987 in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula and is supported by a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. <p> Small schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recruit one may still receive the program via satellite transmission through the Arts and Sciences Teleconferencing Service at Oklahoma State University( OSU). Three days a week, an economics professor at OSU delivers the program through live television broadcasts. The week 's remaining two classroom sessions are devoted to operating the student company, running a computer simulation, visits from the business consultant, and other program activities. The Phillips Petroleum Company provided a grant to support this satellite program for rural schools. <p> The range of Junior Achievement 's programs in the schools continues to grow. During the 1991-92 school year, about 1.3 million students learned about their business and economic world through one of these programs. In the articles that follow, an elementary, middle school, and high school teacher, respectively, relate their experiences with a particular program.
