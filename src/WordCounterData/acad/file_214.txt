4156141 School impairment is often defined in terms of impairment in academic progress( i.e., poor grades). Poor academic performance can occur for several reasons, including poor homework completion, being off task during class lectures, and inefficient study habits. However, school impairment can include other factors such as a student 's inability to interact with teachers and peers and the inability to ask for help when needed. The current study evaluates the Classroom Performance Survey, a measure that includes items pertaining to areas of strengths and weakness for students and specifically designed to assess functioning in secondary schools. Using data from 875 high school students, results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed two factors, Academic Competence and Interpersonal Competence. Normative data on the measure for adolescents are presented and implications for practice and intervention development are discussed. # Children, Research, and Public Policy # School impairment may occur for many reasons, including low cognitive ability, stressful events, poor instruction, and mental health disorders. Regardless of the cause, school impairment is likely to have substantial long-term negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is predictive of poor outcomes, including high school dropout, substance use, delinquency, and poor emotional wellness( see Hawkins, 1997, for a review). Given the long-term negative and positive effects of functioning in school, it is not surprising that school functioning is a common focus of assessment. Specifically, measuring school functioning and impairment is important to determine eligibility for services, inform psychiatric diagnoses, and identify response to interventions( American Psychological Association, 2000 ; Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004). # School functioning includes both academic skills and academic enablers( DiPerna &amp; Elliott, 2000) and contextual variables( Pianta &amp; Walsh, 1996). Impairment in school is a common reason of referral for assessment or additional services, including special education. Of the 370 school psychologists who responded to a recent survey, a majority reported academic problems as the most common reason for referral( Bramlett, Murphy, Johnson, Wallingsford, &amp; Hall, 2002). Similarly, best practices for diagnosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a diagnostic criterion for many disorders. Finally, measures of school functioning play an important role in the measurement of responses to interventions( Chafouleas, Volpe, Gresham, &amp; Cook, 2010). # Although there are measures of school impairment( e.g., Diperna &amp; Elliott, 2000), most have not been designed for the unique environment and demands of a high school. Successful functioning at the secondary level is far more complex than in the younger grades, partly because of the multiple settings across a student 's day( Kent et al., 2011). Teachers ' expectations at the high school level vary considerably between classes and, as a result, a student 's level of functioning is likely to be inconsistent across classes. Thus, unlike elementary schools, there is often not one person in a secondary school who can serve as a source for comprehensive information about a student 's functioning and impairment( Evans, Allen, Moore, &amp; Strauss, 2005). Therefore, the challenges associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, because of the complexity of secondary school academic demands( e.g., long-term projects, expectation for independent tracking of tasks) and social behavior( e.g., variability in behavioral expectations between classes, management of relations between large number of peers and multiple teachers), successful school functioning may involve more variables than during elementary school. Second, because students have many teachers who see students in a variety of contexts, it may not be possible to identify one informant to complete a measure. # In spite of the challenges associated with assessing school impairment and functioning in secondary school, there is a need for an efficient and psychometrically sound measure to inform school personnel. Further, the value of assessment is greatly enhanced if it can directly inform intervention development. The purpose of the current study was( a) to examine the validity of the Classroom Performance Survey as a measure of school functioning with high school students and( b) to collect normative data on the measure for this age group. # Defining School Impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad set of domains, it is often best operationalized by grades, discipline problems, and scores on standardized tests. In fact, grades are used to gain admission to postsecondary education, often considered by potential employers, and used to determine which students receive honors( e.g., Dean 's List, Honor Roll). Given their widespread use as a global index of school functioning, grades have also been used as an outcome measure for school-based interventions( e.g., Schultz, Evans, &amp; Serpell, 2009). This widespread reliance on grades as an indicator of school functioning persists in spite of indications that they are a poor metric( Allen, 2005). In addition to problems with psychometric properties, grades also fail to identify the specific problems that lead to the poor grades and thus are not helpful for prescribing interventions. For example, poor grades may be the result of failing to submit assignments, poor performance on tests, or difficulty taking notes. Thus, grades have value as a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have many limitations related to psychometric properties and lack of specificity. # Although grades are one global index of school functioning, they fail to reflect many nonacademic concepts that students learn at school, including how to effectively socialize with peers and authority figures such as teachers( Berns, 2007). These lessons are especially salient in secondary school as adolescence is a period in which students are refining their self-concepts and social identities( Steinberg &amp; Morris, 2001). Students also learn responsibility and independence as they gain skills related to managing their time, completing assignments, and participating in after school activities. In an effort to account for the complex nature of school functioning, Pianta and Walsh( 1996) proposed the Contextual Systems Model. The Contextual Systems Model includes four interrelated systems : child, family, classroom, and culture. All of the variables included in the model have been found to be strongly associated with school functioning in the literature( Pianta &amp; Walsh, 1996). The child level includes variables such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent--child relationship and family environment. Classroom-level variables include the teacher--child relationship and classroom environment. Finally, culture-level variables include societal values and beliefs. # Although the Contextual Systems Model is a comprehensive model, it is unlikely that one informant would be able to adequately respond to items regarding every system( child, family, classroom, and culture). Another model proposed by DiPerna and Elliott( 2000) focuses exclusively on school-level factors and includes clusters of skills, attitudes, and behaviors that contribute to academic competence. These clusters include study skills, interpersonal skills, academic skills, engagement, and motivation. All clusters in the model except academic skills are considered enablers that contribute to academic competence by enabling success in the school environment and facilitating the acquisition of skills being taught. There is evidence that the clusters in this model predict functioning at school( DiPerna &amp; Elliott, 2000) and a teacher rating measure was developed that reflects this model. # We propose that another way to conceptualize the variables just described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interpersonal skills. Academic skills include behaviors such as one 's ability to study for exams, take good notes in class, and turn in assignments on time, whereas school-related interpersonal skills include behaviors such as cooperating with other students, asking for help when needed, and getting along with peers and teachers. These two categories are a slight reorganization of the academic skills and academic enablers distinction made by DiPerna and Elliott( 2000). According to our reorganization of the model, school impairment can be defined as deficits in academic skills( including study skills), interpersonal skills, or both. If the purpose of an assessment targeting academic success is to be comprehensive, then items assessing home and community contexts as well as other potential academic enablers such as motivation and engagement will be important to include in the measure. If efficiency is a priority, then only the classroom contexts and fewer categories of behavior may be prioritized. # Measuring School Impairment in Secondary Schools # There are contextual challenges associated with assessing school functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning more difficult than it is for children in elementary schools. One of the main challenges is determining an informant who can provide the information being sought. One may consider obtaining information regarding impairment directly from the student ; however, students may overinflate their performance or complete measures with minimal effort( Smith, Pelham, Gnagy, Molina, &amp; Evans, 2000). Given the limitations of self-report, one may consider other informants in the student 's life such as parents. However, parents often have limited knowledge regarding their child 's school impairment as adolescents communicate little with their parents regarding day-to-day school activities( Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, &amp; Duckett, 1996). In addition, parents may have little to no knowledge regarding classroom-level variables such as the teacher--child relationship or classroom expectations. Although teachers have detailed information about students ' functioning in their classroom, they have their own limitations and biases( e.g., Abikoff, Courtney, Pelham, &amp; Koplewicz, 1993). However, compared to parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessing school functioning as they have extensive experience with adolescents ' behavior in the context of their classes. High school teachers see numerous students throughout the day in multiple contexts( e.g., classroom, lunchroom, hallways). Therefore, a high school teacher may have more knowledge of " normative " adolescent behavior than do parents. Yet, obtaining teacher ratings in secondary school poses special considerations as each student can have five to eight teachers for 1 hour or less in differing contexts throughout the day. In addition, each teacher has many more students than most elementary school teachers and therefore may not know each individual student well. # There have been a variety of recommendations for gathering teacher rating data for secondary school students, including recommendations to obtain ratings from specific teachers( e.g., English and math ; Anastopoulos &amp; Shelton, 2001), to administering rating scales to all teachers( Robin, 1998). These recommendations are not empirically supported and questions exist about how to interpret ratings from one or multiple teachers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers rating the same students( Evans, Allen, Moore, &amp; Strauss, 2005 ; Molina, Pelham, Blumenthal, &amp; Galiszewski, 1998). This lack of agreement is partly from differences in behavior and performance between classes for the same student. Given this lack of agreement and the variability in student behavior across classrooms, each classroom may need to be considered an independent setting in which there may be varying levels of functioning and impairment. Multiple ratings also have the advantage of identifying classrooms that should be targeted for intervention as well as determining classrooms or environments in which the student is succeeding. Given the recommendation for gathering multiple ratings and the potential need to ask some teachers for multiple ratings over time( e.g., progress monitoring), there is an advantage for measures that are relatively brief. # Selecting Measures of School Impairment # Our review to this point suggests that when measuring school functioning in high schools, there are benefits to measures that are brief and completed by multiple classroom teachers. In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform intervention prescription, then assessments that include specific questions or factors indicating problems that can inform intervention selection are preferable. Our review of the literature indicated that there are four assessment instruments that evaluate school functioning for high school students. These are described in the following. # Impairment Rating Scale( IRS) # The IRS is a 5-( teacher version) to 7-item( parent version) measure that requires raters to indicate a student 's level of impairment in the areas of relationship with peers, academic, family, and self-esteem. High scores indicate an extreme problem and a high need for treatment. The IRS has been examined for use in secondary schools and has been shown to be reliable and valid for use with an adolescent population( Evans et al., 2011, in press). Scores may be interpreted to indicate whether impairment exists within a given domain and it takes little time for teachers to complete. The IRS includes a teacher version, can be administered to several teachers, and is brief. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can indicate the presence of impairment, it does not provide the detailed information needed for selecting interventions. # Homework Problems Checklist( HPC) # The HPC( Anesko, Schoiock, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 1987) is a 20-item parent report measure of homework-related behaviors. Unfortunately, there are no normative data available to inform use in secondary schools. Although it may be useful to obtain information specific to homework completion, many other behaviors central to academic impairment are not assessed. In addition, there is only a parent report version of the HPC as it only assesses academic activities conducted at home. # Academic Competence Evaluation Scale( ACES) # The ACES( DiPerna &amp; Elliott, 2000) was created to measure the skills, attitudes, and behaviors most pertinent to school impairment. It is a 73-item measure that includes a teacher version and norms for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Item content ranges from rating academic skills, such as reading comprehension and computation, to following directions in the classroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of academic behaviors, the ACES contains only one form--in other words, students in kindergarten are assessed with the same items as those in 12th grade. Therefore, the ACES may not be sensitive to some of the most unique adolescent academic behaviors that pertain to academic functioning( e.g., long-term planning). The benefit of providing details about a broad range of behaviors relevant to school impairment comes at the cost of being a long and time-consuming measure to complete. This can be particularly problematic when using it to measure response to an intervention through frequent administrations or when administered for a large number of students, as this may lead to excessive teacher burden. Finally, the ACES manual and protocols, unlike the IRS or HPC, must be purchased through the publisher. # Classroom Performance Survey( CPS) # The CPS was designed by the Public and Professional Education Committee of the Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder( 1996). As impairment in school is common among individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to provide professionals with a brief measure of classroom functioning specific to secondary school settings. The 22-item( 20 Likert-type and 2 non-Likert) measure includes questions pertaining to deficits commonly associated with adolescents with ADHD and that have been associated with poor academic outcomes in the literature. The CPS has been used to investigate the nature of school impairment in students ' with ADHD( Kent et al., 2010) as well as treatment outcome research( e.g., Evans, Schultz, DeMars, &amp; Davis, 2011 ; Meyer &amp; Kelley, 2007). # Because the CPS is a relative brief measure, it could be used as a screener to indicate when more assessment( e.g., referral for special education) is needed ; however, it also includes specific items that have implications for interventions such as questions about taking notes in class, turning in assignments on time, and asking for help when needed. A major disadvantage of the CPS is that it has not been psychometrically evaluated and does not have normative data. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief measure of school functioning that can be completed by teachers and inform the prescribing of individualized interventions, the CPS appears to be a good candidate for further development and study. # Current Study # Although the CPS was developed to measure school functioning and impairment with adolescents, it has not been evaluated for this use. The primary purpose of the current study was to examine the construct validity of the CPS with an adolescent population. The first aim was to explore the factor structure of the CPS using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses techniques. Because this was the first study examining the structure of the CPS, results may indicate modifications to the items that will be made and further tested. The second aim was to calculate the reliability of the factors and provide school professionals with normative data on each item and scale by gender. The third aim was to examine two additional non-Likert scale items on the CPS in terms their construct validity and clinical utility. # Method # Participants # Schools. Data were collected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators in the Center for Adolescent Research in Schools( CARS ; IES : R324C080006). Data on the schools that participated in this study are presented in Table 1. # Teachers. Responses were collected from 146 high school teachers( 69.9% female). Teachers self-identified as 82.5% Caucasian, 3.4% African American, 9.8% Asian, and 2.8% Other. A minority of the respondents were special education teachers( 11%) and the remainder of the teachers were evenly distributed across class types( 25.8% language arts, 19.5% social studies, 18.1% science, and 26.5% math). On average, at the time of the study, teachers had been teaching for 11.51 years( SD = 10.06, median = 9.00). # Students. Students( n = 875 ; 52.8% female) were selected by participating teachers following a set of decision rules( see student selection section below) provided by the investigators. Teachers reported that the students in the sample were 36.9% Caucasian, 39.8% African American, 9.8% Hispanic, 0.7% Asian, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a trend of declining numbers with higher grades( 33% 9th, 28.6% 10th, 19.1% 11th, and 17.9% 12th). Student demographic information was based on teacher report. # Measures # Classroom Performance Survey( CPS). The CPS is a 20-item Likert-type response measure that includes items regarding students ' classroom behaviors. It includes items such as " brings necessary materials to class " and " relates positively to teacher(s). " A score of 1 on an item indicates always, 3 indicates sometimes, and a score of 5 indicates never. Therefore, higher scores on the measure indicate the presence of more impairment and lower scores indicate higher levels of functioning. In this study, we used a recently revised version of the CPS by Robin( 1998), which includes two additional non-Likert items regarding the percentage of assignments turned in by the student and the percentage of assignments completed by the average student in the same classroom. There are no psychometric data available on the CPS. This article is the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # IRS--Teacher Version. The IRS( Fabiano et al., 2006) is a 5-item assessment that includes teachers ' ratings of peer relations, relationship with teacher, academic progress, classroom functioning, self-esteem, and overall severity on a 7-point scale. Teachers place a mark on a line representing the adolescent 's severity of impairment from 0 indicating no problem and definitely does not need treatment to 6 indicating extreme problem and definitely needs treatment. A score of 3 or above is considered " impaired " in that domain whereas a score of 2 or below is considered " nonimpaired. " In addition, teachers are given space to provide narrative information. This measure has demonstrated, in four samples of children with ADHD and matched comparison children, good temporal stability( 1-year correlations ranged from.54 to.76 ; p &lt;.01) and appropriate correlations with other impairment ratings and behavioral measures( correlations ranged from.58 to.85 ; p &lt;.01 ; Fabiano et al., 2006). It also correlates with other measures of impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Setterberg, Bird, &amp; Gould, 1992), Impact on Family Scale( Sheeber &amp; Johnson, 1992), and the Daily Hassles Scale( Crnic &amp; Greenberg, 1990). # Procedures # Teacher recruitment. Administrators at schools collaborating with investigators at five of the seven sites involved with the Center for Adolescent Research in Schools were contacted by investigators to recruit individual teachers from each school for this study( see Table 1). The investigators explained the purpose and procedures of the study and time required of participating teachers. After school administrators provided consent to participate in the study, all teachers in the collaborating schools were contacted via a letter describing the study and inviting the teacher to participate. Once a teacher signed and returned a letter agreeing to participate, the teacher was given instructions for randomly selecting 3 male and 3 female students( see student selection), completing the three rating scales( IRS, CPS, and the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale DBD, which is not analyzed here), @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at many participating schools to explain the purposes of the study and answer questions. During this initial phase of teacher recruitment, teachers completed appropriate informed consent procedures. # To encourage participation, teachers from each school who completed the procedures were entered in a drawing( three prizes were awarded at each school) and winners were paid up to 75 dollars. Parent and student consents were not obtained as no identifying information about students was collected and the researchers did not have direct contact with students. Although exact response rate by school was not obtained, we estimated, based on a subsample of participating schools, that an average of 32.64% of eligible teachers at each school indicated they wished to participate. The response rate was calculated by obtaining the total number of core academic teachers from three participating schools and dividing that number by the number of students in each school. This provided the number of core academic teachers per student. We then used this number to estimate the number of teachers at each school based on their student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to participate. # Distribution and collection of packets. Packets containing six sets of three rating scales( i.e., the DBD, the IRS, and the CPS) were created with ID numbers for each teacher and were distributed. Thus, each teacher was given one set of rating scales for each of his/her participating students. Each distributed packet was constructed in the following order : cover letter, student selection form, demographic questionnaire, CPS, IRS, and DBD. Teachers were instructed to return the completed sealed packets to a box in the school mailroom within 2 weeks after distribution. Completed packets were collected at least once a week for 2 weeks. After the first week of data collection, investigators sent reminder cards or e-mails to participating teachers. Reminder cards and e-mails thanked teachers for their participation but also reminded them of the final date of data collection. # Student selection. Specific instructions for selecting students were provided to teachers to eliminate teacher selection bias based on behavior, gender, or other student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender, based on the order in which students ' names appeared in the teachers ' grade books for their first period class. To achieve unbiased selection, teachers selected the first, third, and fifth student from their roster but also used the following procedures. Teachers added the seventh student on the roster to the list of those being rated if the student was not the fourth participant of the same gender as the first three, but teachers proceeded to the ninth student on their roster if the seventh student was the fourth of the same gender. The teachers then continued this process until 3 males and 3 females were selected, but if a teacher arrived at the end of the roster and did not yet have 3 boys and 3 girls, then the teacher continued the selection process by choosing the second student on the roster and continued through all of the even-numbered students until 3 boys and 3 girls were selected. # Analyses # To address the first aim of the study( establishing the factor structure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a randomly selected third of the participants ' data and eliminated items with either poor loadings or equal loadings onto multiple factors. Once the factor structure finalized, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis on the remaining two-thirds of the data. To further explore the validity of the CPS factors, we correlated each factor with items on the IRS. To address the second aim( examine reliability and present normative data), we calculated reliability estimates for each of the factors and calculated means and standard deviations for each item. Finally, to address the third aim( examining the validity and clinical utility of the two additional CPS items), we calculated the means and standard deviations on these items and examined the relationship between these items and the IRS. # Results # Factor Analysis of the CPS # As this is the first psychometric analysis, we began by conducting an exploratory factor analysis( EFA) in order to determine if the items were measuring one large construct( e.g., overall school functioning) or were measuring several independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class tasks, homework tasks). The EFA was conducted with the 20 Likert-type items using 269 randomly selected students balanced across site and across gender( approximately one-third of the sample). As CFAs require a larger sample than EFAs, we decided that two-thirds of the sample would be used in the CFA and the remaining would be used in the EFA. Because we collected ratings of 6 students from each participating teacher, the standard errors and X2 statistics of the EFAs and confirmatory factor analyses( CFAs) were adjusted to account for nonindependence of observations using multilevel modeling in Mplus( CLUSTER function). Using oblique rotation, results showed that maintaining two factors produced the most adequate fit while maintaining the highest discrimination between item loadings and obtaining the greatest conceptual clarity between the factors. # Based on the item loadings, the factors appeared to involve Academic Competence( e.g., turning in homework, doing well on tests) and Interpersonal Competence( e.g., asking for help when needed, getting along with peers). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar magnitude. This can cause difficulty in terms of fitting a model using CFA as well as create problems with scoring and interpretation. Therefore, we began the process of item reduction employing a method described by Worthington and Whittaker( 2006) in which items are eliminated if the difference between the loadings of an item onto each factor is less than 0.15. After each item was deleted, the EFA was rerun to estimate new factor loadings. This process continued until items no longer met Worthington and Whittaker 's( 2006) criteria. Using this process, 3 items were eliminated from the measure( Items 9, 12 and 15). In addition, 2 more items( Items 10 and 11) were eliminated based on their high correlation with each other as well as the low variance accounted for in the factors by these items. In other words, these 2 items appeared highly related to each other and only slightly related to the larger constructs Academic Competence or Interpersonal Competence. The final resulting EFA produced two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, and 14) and Interpersonal Competence( Items 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 ; see Table 3 for item descriptions). # To assess the fit of the model produced by the EFA with another sample, we used CFA using robust weighted least squares estimation with the remaining 591 participants ' data. The correlation matrix analyzed is included in Table 2. The? for the two-factor model( Academic Competence and Interpersonal Competence) was?( 89) = 632.99, p &lt;.001, indicating inadequate fit. However, for sample sizes larger than 400, the? test will almost always be significant( Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2004). # Based on recommendations by Yu and Muthen( 2002), we also examined the Comparative Fit Index( CFI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation( RMSEA) in addition to the Weighted Root Mean Square Residual( WRMR). Recommended cutoffs are less than or equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMSEA( Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993), and 0.95 or above for the CFI( Hu &amp; Bender, 1999). The two-factor model met two of the recommended cutoffs of the three fit indices( WRMR = 1.56, RMSEA = 0.10, CFI = 0.98). Although there is room for improvement with regard to model fit, several points were considered. First, the cutoff values suggested from other authors are just that, suggestions, and are not gold standards( Marsh, 2004). It may be that the fit indices for this model are close enough to the cutoff to warrant adequate fit( i.e., WRMR cutoff of 1.00 and a value of 1.56). Second, it has been recommended that determining adequate model fit only includes investigating one measure of incremental fit( the CFI) and one measure of absolute fit( the RMSEA ; Byrne, 1998). Using these recommendations, the model tested warrants interpretation. Therefore, based on the conceptual and statistical interpretation of the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fit and will be interpreted. The standardized and unstandardized solutions for the two-factor model are presented in Table 3. # CPS and Its Relationship to Other Measures of Impairment # To further evaluate the validity of the CPS and the two factors found in our analyses, we examined the correlation between the CPS factors and specific domains of impairment on the IRS, and these results are presented in Table 4( i.e., academic progress, interactions with peers, relationship with teachers, and classroom functioning). Consistent with our interpretation of the factors, the Academic Competency factor on the CPS correlated most strongly with impaired academic progress on the IRS( r =.73 ; high scores indicate impairment on both) and less so with impaired interactions with peers( r =.47). In addition, the Interpersonal Competence factor correlated most strongly with impaired relationship with teachers( r =.70). Although there are no large differences in some of these correlations, the results suggest that the two factors of the CPS are most related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for their construct validity. # Reliability of the CPS # Our second aim was to further investigate the psychometric properties of the CPS by calculating the composite reliability( coefficient omega) of each factor( Table 5). Coefficient omega is often used to calculate reliability when researchers are interested in the extent to which items measure the same latent variable( Zinbarg, Revelle, Yovel, &amp; Li, 2005). These results revealed that both Academic Competence and Interpersonal Competence factors are highly reliable( 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). Normative data on the measure for an adolescent population ages 14-19 are presented by item, by factor, and by gender in Table 5. These results show that the mean frequency of interpersonal problems was slightly lower than the mean frequency of academic competency problems. Further, recording assignments consistently were reported as the most frequently occurring problem and respect for property was the least common problem. # Clinical Utility of the CPS # The third aim of this study was to examine the clinical utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate the percent of assignments completed and submitted on time by the student being assessed and the percent of assignments completed and submitted on time by the average student in the class. The mean percentages and standard deviations for these 2 items are included in Table 5. In addition, we sought to explore the validity of these 2 items using each of these percentages in a multiple regression equation to predict academic impairment scores on the IRS. We hypothesized that the absolute amount of assignments the target student turns in completed and on time should influence a teacher 's perception of academic impairment. However, some classrooms may have lower expectations for students than do others. For example, a student turning in only 50% of his/her assignments may be perceived as more impaired in a classroom where 100% of assignments are turned in by all other students, compared to a classroom where the average is 60%. Therefore, we decided to enter the absolute percentage of assignments turned in by the target student into the model first and then enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the percentage reported for the target student and subtracting the percentage turned in by the typical student( negative values indicate the target student is performing below the typical student average ; M = -3.3, SD = 27.6). # Results of this analysis indicated that both the absolute amount of assignments submitted b = -.54, f(560) = -9.1, p &lt;.001 and the discrepancy score b = -.20, t(560) = -4.19, p &lt;.001 significantly contributed to the prediction of teachers ' ratings of academic impairment on the IRS R =.51, F( 2, 560) = 428.08, p &lt;.001. For every percent increase in the amount of assignments submitted on time by the target student, ratings of academic impairment decreased by.54. Similarly, for every positive percent increase in the discrepancy( i.e., the difference between the target student 's completion rate and the classroom completion rate) score, academic impairment decreased by.20. # To further evaluate this relationship, we compared the frequency of assignment completion among students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( rated as 3 or above) and students rated as unimpaired( less than 3). These results, as expected, indicated that the students whose teachers rated them as academically impaired completed an average of only 45.0%( SD = 28.8) of their assignments. Conversely, students rated as nonimpaired completed an average of 83.7%( SD = 19.2) of assignments. The difference in assignment completion between impaired and nonimpaired students was statistically significant? = 335.09( 1, 64), p &lt;.001. Next, we examined a frequency distribution of the percentage of assignments completed by each student( see Figure 1). Within each group of students, we determined the portions who were rated as academically impaired on the IRS and these portions are indicated by the dark portions of the bars in Figure 1. As can be seen in the figure, the portion of the groups who were rated as impaired becomes smaller as the percentage of homework completed becomes greater. It is worth noting that there are students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated as academically impaired by their teachers and there are students who completed 90% of their assignments or more who were rated as academically impaired. As evidenced by the correlations in Table 4, completing assignments is related to teachers ' ratings of academic impairment, but does not completely account for it. # Discussion # The primary aim of this study was to examine the reliability and construct validity of the CPS with an adolescent population. Overall, the revised version of the CPS appears to be a viable option for those wishing to measure school impairment. The measure is brief, completed by teachers, and provides very specific information about the nature of impairment. # A Two-Factor Model of Impairment # The two factors established from the CPS were Academic Competence and Interpersonal Competence. One of the limitations of some teacher ratings of social functioning is that they sometimes ask high school teachers about social behavior that can not be adequately judged in classrooms. Consistent with the goals of the task force that created the items for this measure, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPS refer to behaviors that are observable by the teacher during the time he/she has the student in class. For example, the interpersonal items focus on behaviors such as asking a teacher for assistance, communicating well with the teacher, and getting along with other students. The mean item scores for this factor indicate that typical high school students demonstrate appropriate interpersonal behaviors more often than " sometimes " and a rating of " always " is within one standard deviation of the mean. # The 10 items that are the Academic Competence factor target specific classroom behaviors and levels of performance that are critical to successful academic functioning in high school( e.g., assignment completion, quality work, arrives with materials on time, and test performance). The 2 items pertaining to assignment completion( Completes homework on time and Records assignments consistently) had the highest mean scores indicating that teachers believe this to be a common area for problems. In fact, a student would be within one standard deviation of the mean with a rating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A score of 4 could be interpreted as " rarely " or " infrequently " and our results indicate that this characterization of responsibility for one 's homework assignments is normal. These 2 items have the largest difference in means between boys and girls, but the normal range includes students rated as problematic for both. Performance on tests and accuracy on assignments were the two items rated as the next most common areas for problems. These 4 items on the academic competence factor are most related to activities that influence grades and as a result may be the most closely monitored by teachers. Greater attention to the activities assessed by these 4 items than the others may contribute to the higher ratings. Overall, the mean scores indicate that typical high school students complete these academic activities more often than sometimes, but the normal range for some of the items includes students who teachers rate as closer to never than always. # Lack of Gender Differences # Normative data are presented in Table 5 and indicate that teachers ' ratings of girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item. Although this difference is interesting, there seems to be little justification for using same-sex norms when interpreting indices of impairment at school. Functioning is an interaction between individual competencies and expectations or normative behaviors in the setting being assessed. So unless the expectations for successful school functioning are different for boys and girls, interpretation of scores using same-sex norms may be confusing. To the degree that academic and interpersonal expectations between the genders in high school are equivalent, score interpretation will be aided by using the normative data for both genders. # Homework Completion # As described in the results section, the percentage of assignments completed by those rated as impaired( 45%) was significantly less than the percentage completed by those rated as not impaired( 83.7%) on the academic impairment item on the IRS r(428) = 20.56, p &lt;.001. Furthermore, the percentage of assignments completed by the student being assessed contributed to the prediction of academic impairment ratings on the IRS. In addition to the assignment completion score, the difference score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the prediction of impairment. This difference score adds to the prediction by taking into account the normative behavior in the classroom. It was interesting to note that the mean percentage of assignments completed on time were quite similar for the target student and average student in the class( as would be predicted). A review of the data indicate that approximately 11% of the teachers reported that the average student in the class only completes and submits assignments on time 60% of the time or less. Only 17% of the teachers reported that the average student completes and submits assignments on time 90% of the time or more. These data document the large variability in expectations and normative behavior between high school classrooms and the importance of gathering information about the classroom when interpreting scores specific to a student being assessed. # Potential Implications for Treatment # These results indicate that the CPS could result in data that may be useful for various decisions with high school students. We believe that the two-factor structure of the CPS could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, after administering the questionnaire to teachers, school professionals could identify the student 's primary domain of impairment( e.g., academic competence, interpersonal competence, or both). Responses to individual items on each factor can specifically inform the prescription of interventions. For example, problems completing tasks on time could lead to evidence-based organization interventions( Sadler, Evans, Schultz, &amp; Zoromski, 2011). If the student does not take notes during class, an intervention may be developed in which the teacher teaches the student to take notes and checks the student 's notebook after class and rewards specific note-taking behaviors( Evans, Pelham, &amp; Grudberg, 1995). Furthermore, if a student does not get along well with the teacher, the student may require a behavior management plan in the classroom or may benefit from an interpersonal skills group( Sadler, Evans, Schultz, &amp; Zoromski, 2011). The CPS may also be used to assess progress or identify another area of impairment. The use of the CPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies may wish to examine the potential use of the CPS for treatment prescription and to monitor student progress. # Scores on the scales or items may serve as indices to measure response to interventions, although there is very little research to support its sensitivity to change. The studies that have used this to measure outcomes have reported improvement in teachers ' ratings in response to interventions( Evans et al., 2011 ; Meyer &amp; Kelley, 2007). These studies used a total score for all 20 items and analyzed the percentage of completed assignments. Conducting analyses using the two scales may enhance sensitivity to treatment response. # Limitations and Future Directions # One of the limitations of this study is the lack of indices, other than teacher report, that could be used to validate the items and factors. Grades, observations, or self-report data could have added to our evaluation of validity. Another limitation of this study is that the teachers and schools were not selected at random and each teacher completed six ratings. Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the investigators at each of the six sites in the Center for Adolescent Research in Schools. The sample was comprised of a group of teachers who volunteered at each school. Although the sample included a large number of minority students and communities with a wide range of income levels, it was not randomly selected. In addition, we do not have the exact response rate of teachers who agreed to participate in the study and were forced to estimate based on a sample of schools. Finally, measurement packets were not counterbalanced ; therefore, we were not able to evaluate order effects. # In spite of the limitations, these data support the use of the CPS as a tool to measure the school impairment of high school students. The focus on the measurement of impairment has increased in the last decade as it has become clear that impairment, more than symptoms, is the priority for stakeholders and should be the target of interventions. A review of the published literature indicates that the school impairment of adolescents has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the complexities of secondary schools and the adolescents themselves have been limiting factors in this line of research. These data provide some evidence for the reliability and validity of the CPS for secondary school students ; however, future research should focus on other psychometric aspect of the measure, including test-retest and inter-rater reliability, sensitivity, and specificity. Future studies may seek to pilot additional items that may be highly correlated with impairment in secondary schools. Because the Interpersonal Competence domain only contains 5 items, there may be other student behaviors in this domain that lead to impairment( e.g., speaking out of turn). Future studies may also test the use of the CPS as an intervention prescription tool and as a treatment outcome measure. # Funding for this study was provided by the Institute of Education Sciences to Lee Kern, Steven W.
