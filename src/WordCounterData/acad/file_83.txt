4012241 Although teaching and research in the arts and sciences are the sine qua non of the modern university in the United States, that tradition has increasingly come under attack. 1 Part of the problem is that many people, including some faculty members, define the teaching and research roles in dichotomous terms. Moreover, many faculty members " often behave as though only one role really matters -- that of research, of creating new knowledge. " 2 This view of teaching and research poses a complex set of problems that broadly affects higher education. Among other things, it calls us to reexamine the message we convey to junior faculty members through the promotion and tenure process ; it impacts the strategies we employ to invigorate unproductive faculty members ; it calls into question how we enhance research productivity without compromising our academic mission ; and it affects the very nature of the curriculum by impacting our perceptions of what we should teach. Our ability to respond to these challenges will not only affect the future vitality of the arts in higher education, it will significantly influence how the arts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years to come. <p> This article focuses on two of these challenges. My purpose is to call attention to emerging policy issues that arise from a changing climate for research and teaching in higher education. By research, I mean all forms of creative and scholarly inquiry in which new knowledge is created, regardless of whether those intellectual products take form in print, performance, production, or practice. In higher education, we teach to foster intellectual development and expertise through the study of advanced disciplinary knowledge and skills. Teaching includes all activities that support and give structure to learning, including but not limited to what goes on in the classroom, in the studio, on the stage, at the library, in the laboratory, out in the field, in faculty offices, in galleries, and throughout the corridors of our institutions. <p> I will argue that pressures within and outside higher education require arts education policymakers to reconceptualize the relationship between faculty research and teaching. Out of necessity, we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the known and unknown are simultaneously investigated through student and faculty exchange. Our traditional concepts of " the core curriculum " will require redefinition to face the rapid expansion of disciplinary knowledge in each of our fields. The expansion of knowledge will necessitate further specialization within disciplines, yet add greater importance to interdisciplinary. applications. K-12 arts education must respond to these same pressures. <p> I will also argue that a static or declining resource base for higher education should widen differences among universities, not reduce them. As our disciplines expand, we run the risk of spreading disciplinary knowledge too thin if we do not better capitalize on the institutional context in which teaching and research takes place. We should alter our curricula, selectively building depth to maximize the unique strengths of our respective institutions. I am not alone in recommending that arts programs at large universities should avoid replicating what can best be undertaken at smaller liberal arts colleges, independent schools of art and design, and conservatories for the performing arts that follow European beaux-arts traditions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ways to maximize its institutional contexts instead of striving to emulate university models for teaching and learning in the arts. Public Perceptions of Research in Higher Education <p> It is important for us to consider why many people are critical of the research role that faculty members are expected to play in higher education. Most agree that the discovery of new knowledge is absolutely crucial in our complicated and vulnerable world. 4 But the general public is concerned that higher education has become so preoccupied with research that faculty members have little time and energy left to teach. Others believe that much of the new knowledge produced by faculty members is too far removed from reality to be of any social value. Practitioners in some disciplines, including K-12 teachers, express concern or even contempt for research in higher education because they construe it as esoteric and/or frivolous. And, as we further specialize to cope with the growing volume of new knowledge in our respective disciplines, the public 's perception that our research is absurdly narrow and arcane intensifies. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always attracted by creative research, even from those persons whom we think of as reasonably intelligent. For instance, you may recall the segment on 60 Minutes in which Morley Safer harshly attacked contemporary art. That story was the subject of a later article in People Weekly, a PBS special, and an episode of Murphy Brown. As recounted in People Weekly : <p> Safer, 62, his gravelly voice rumbling with contempt, proceeded to savage such high-priced contemporary artists as Cy Twombly( one of whose $2 million paintings Safer described as " a canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush "), Jeff Koons( who recently was paid $150,000 for three basketballs submerged in a fish tank -- " giving new meaning to " slam dunk, " said Safer) and Robert Gobler, whose displayed creations included a row of three porcelain urinals. All these works, said Safer, flushed with indignation, " belong in the trash heap of art history, " and anyone who buys them is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewer response to this 60 Minutes segment. Over 500 letters were received( more than any previous story by the reporter), and the vast majority of those letters supported Safer 's critical point of view. Unfortunately, such criticism has not been limited to the visual arts nor to contemporary art-works alone. <p> So why dwell on this criticism when it might otherwise be dismissed as uninformed perception? It demands our attention, I believe, because it is mostly uninformed. As educators, we are in the business of informing perceptions. Our mission should be to help others understand the value of our research activities. Toward that end, we should assess why even those persons who interact within our immediate sphere -- our students( many of whom go on to become K-12 teachers) -- all too often fail to understand our role as researchers. Common Misconceptions about Knowledge Acquisition <p> Faculty research may be largely undervalued because we have not done a good job in helping people understand what our research entails. Traditional teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of new knowledge. Few people get a close-up view of research as such -- the perspective needed to truly understand how knowledge in a discipline evolves through research inquiry. <p> Think about it in the context of the nation 's K-12 educational system, which tends to represent disciplinary knowledge as " baskets of facts. " 6 Schools also perpetuate the misconception that knowledge is what you find in books -- nothing else really counts. 7 Generally speaking, K-12 students rarely ask, nor do their teachers explain, how knowledge is created or in what ways it can take form. <p> In his 1993 presidential address to the American Educational Research Association, Elliot Eisner cited Marcy Singer 's 1991 study of how high school students perceive historical knowledge. Singer found that " students had a difficult time regarding anything other than text as a source of knowledge about the past. They regarded the textbook as sacrosanct " -- the prevalent misconception that if something is written in a book, it must be true. 8 These perceptions were not altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide array of source materials, including the following : <p> Charlie Chaplin 's film, Modern Times ; the film, Rebel without a Cause ; the music of Scott Joplin ; the songs of Pete Seeger ; the music of the Beatles ; the Autobiography of Malcolm X ; Juan Williams 's television program, Eyes on the Prize ; John Steinbeck 's book, Grapes of Wrath ; Ben Shahn 's painting, The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti ; television 's Leave it to Beaver ; the music of Chuck Berry ; paintings by Jackson Pollack. <p> Singer observed that although these historical examples were not thought of as knowledge, their ambiguous nature made for the best classroom discussions. Eisner notes : <p> In restrospect, this is not surprising. After all, what is there to discuss when students confront the certainties of the text? When it comes to forms of representation that invite interpretation, interpretation followed. 9 <p> As Singer 's study suggests, students who are pursuing higher education, including students in the arts and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to interpret and create new knowledge. Although their professors engage in these activities, even advanced students in many fields rarely get a close-up view of faculty research. Very few students have opportunities to see firsthand either how new ideas are cultivated in a discipline or how ideas are crossfertilized through exchanges with other disciplines. Keeping Up with the Expansion of Disciplinary Knowledge <p> One reason why we need to rethink the relationship between teaching and research is because existing curriculum standards do not provide the means to keep pace with the rate at which current knowledge is expanding. Ever since World War II, when universities broadened their focus on teaching to become major research centers, faculty members have played a leading role in the production of new intellectual products. The explosion of new knowledge has been almost unimaginable. Just consider the following statistics : It has been estimated that more new information has been produced in the last thirty years than in the previous 5,000 years. 10 A typical weekday edition of the New York Times contains more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an entire lifetime. 11 In 1989, it was estimated that 7,000 books were published each day across the globe ; compare that to the mid-fourteenth century when 1,300 volumes made up the entire collection of the largest library in Europe, the Sorbonne Library in Paris. 12 In fiscal year 1992, 108 major American and Canadian universities reported that their library holdings were over 330 million volumes and 3 million serials, and that they were accumulating additional holdings at the rate of over 9 million volumes per year. 13 <p> The production of new knowledge in the arts is partly reflected in these statistics, but much of what we create does not take form in print. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, no national records are kept on the volume of new works produced each year in the visual and performing arts. Other sources, however, report that production within many U.S. arts and design fields is growing rapidly. For instance, the U.S. film, music, and video industries have been so prolific that some European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, particularly those productions that, by our own standards, have little artistic merit or social value. 14 <p> Also consider that technologies emerging today will give us the ability to create knowledge as never before. 15 It is estimated that the amount of available information now doubles every four or five years, and, by the turn of the century, the doubling time will be every twenty months. 16 This phenomenon has already made a significant impact on creative research. <p> The artist in the last quarter of the century has been faced with a series of problematic choices. Because experiment in the arts has been so wide-ranging and because modern technology makes so much experience immediately available as a subject or example, the artist 's range of options has never been greater. At the same time such range can be seen as fragmenting and arbitrary, dictated not by the pressures of coherent society so much as by a plethora of information. 17 <p> Consequently, some faculty members are doing their very best to restrict the flow of new information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all. That resistance is not altogether unwarranted because, as humorist Dave Barry observes, much of that information and those ideas are not worth having access to. Looking back to the future, Barry quips in a recent Newsweek article that : <p> By the mid-90 's, just about everybody was hooked up to the vast international computer network, exchanging vast quantities of information at high speeds via modems and fiber-optic cable with everyone else. The problem, of course, was that even though the information was coming a lot faster, the vast majority of it, having originated with human beings, was still wrong. Eventually people realized that the Information Highway was essentially CB radio, but with more typing. 18 <p> In all seriousness, we face an enormous challenge in deciding how to help students grasp the big picture of our disciplines while leading them to develop in-depth knowledge in an area of specialization that will serve them well beyond graduation. Making choices about the depth and breadth of a curriculum is an age-old problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from. Never before has the big picture been so big. As arts education policymakers, we will need to pay more attention to this problem and look for ways to adapt or reinvent the infrastructure upon which our existing curriculum rests. It is equally important that universities build curricular infrastructures that will undergird curricular reform in K-12 arts education. The Disciplinary Structure of Teaching and Research in Higher Education <p> Historically, higher education has given structure to knowledge dissemination by organizing the curriculum around academic disciplines. The disciplinary curricular structure of U.S. universities took hold between 1870 and 1900, when <p> the number of college faculty grew nearly fivefold, from 5,553 to 23,863. The number increased not primarily to keep pace with student enrollment( 113,131graduates in 1870 ; 226,530 in 1900), but to accommodate the growth in academic research and outreach services. 19 <p> The production of new disciplinary knowledge is now integral to the curricular infrastructure of modern universities. The actual process of creating new knowledge, however, has been principally reserved for faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terminal master 's degree programs, students are typically seen as the receivers of new knowledge, not as creators. Students may engage in exercises and experiments to rediscover existing disciplinary knowledge or to practice problem solving and decision making in the discipline, but these learning activities are typically not regarded as research that yields new knowledge. <p> Generally speaking, higher education does not enable its students to understand how knowledge is actually created. This is even often true in teacher education programs. Consider students ' typical introduction to disciplinary knowledge through survey courses. Despite the best of intentions, many survey courses merely provide <p> a groundwork of facts and principles, leaving out connections to the people who have advanced the field and delaying the introduction of the wonder of discovery to the more advanced levels of instruction. 20 <p> As the body of knowledge in a discipline grows, survey courses become increasingly less useful. We should question whether this historical curriculum model will soon become obsolete. Are we asking the faculty members who teach survey courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members identify disciplinary knowledge that should be omitted from the curriculum? Providing answers to the latter question is especially relevant for those who seek to build more substantial bridges between universities and K-12 schools. The Nature of Advanced Learning <p> We also need to reexamine our expectations about student learning. While some educators believe students can be best served by knowing a little about a lot of things as long as they also possess critical thinking skills, research on learning does not support this argument. What seems certain is that the acquisition of expertise is discipline specific. 21 For example, an expert in nuclear physics will function as a relative novice in solving problems in political science or in understanding the historical significance of contributions by Martha Graham to dance, Mies van der Rohe to architecture, Arnold Schoenberg to music, Arthur Miller to theatre, and Georgia O'Keeffe to the visual arts. <p> Research on novice/expert differences also shows that experts use effective knowledge-seeking strategies and advanced thinking skills because they have acquired a sizable body of in-depth disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " learning how to learn. " 23 <p> One continually encounters the pronouncement that students ' heads should not be filled with information but that instead students should be taught how to find the information they need. This is one of the silliest of persisting ideas in education. A related but more plausible educational belief is that students should not be taught isolated facts ; rather, they should be taught central concepts that render facts meaningful. Research... has shown, however, that the ability to grasp and retain new information, to link it meaningfully to central ideas, depends greatly on the extent of one 's existing knowledge. People with little knowledge in a domain are almost compelled to deal with knowledge as isolated fragments, only vaguely relatable to higher level principles. 24 <p> The problem we must address is that novices in any field tend to develop " shallow " knowledge structures. They acquire " a few general ideas and a lot of details connected to the general ideas but not to each other. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule, or a specialized vocabulary without understanding the conditions of how and where that knowledge applies and can be used most effectively. " 26 <p> As experts, faculty members possess " deep or multilevel knowledge structures, with many connections between and within levels. " 27 This equips them to use their knowledge in various contexts, while novices often find it difficult to transfer their existing knowledge at appropriate times. When a student 's prior knowledge becomes inert, it is rendered essentially useless. Didactic teaching methods, compartmentalized curricula, and rote-learning strategies encourage the acquisition of inert knowledge, which, in turn, stifles the development of learning in a discipline. <p> The educational implications of these findings are worth policy-makers ' serious consideration. It is increasingly evident that we should work towards setting curriculum standards to disseminate knowledge that students will be able to use later -- not in the restrictive sense of vocational application alone, but for the broader purpose of enhancing thinking and expertise. This means disseminating as much knowledge to students as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise find meaningful. <p> As the body of disciplinary knowledge expands, we will face even harder choices in selecting what to teach, let alone how to ensure that content is meaningfully disseminated to students. If the solution to this problem is to narrow the curriculum by creating more subdisciplines and areas of specializations, we must be aware that organizing curricula in this way can reduce our students ' ability to grasp important connections within and beyond arts disciplines. One way to help students see past discipline boundaries is to align curriculum standards and teaching practices to correspond more closely with the ways research inquiry is pursued in our disciplines. The Influence of Other Disciplines on Research in the Arts and Design <p> It is not uncommon for artists and scholars to draw upon ideas from other disciplines in their personal research. The attraction of interdisciplinary collaboration is that we can continue to pursue depth within an area of specialization, yet draw upon expertise in related disciplines when the need arises. This allows us to gain valuable input from other fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own discipline. <p> Some researchers in the arts search for innovation by working back and forth between two or more disciplines. Crossdisciplinary research has a strong history in the arts -- some of the best known examples date back to the Italian Renaissance and earlier. For instance, Michelangelo 's work crossed painting, sculpture, and architecture, and Leonardo da Vinci worked simultaneously as a painter, astronomer, architect, and engineer, among other things. <p> Contemporary researchers in the arts have had more difficulty in working between disciplines. For example, on my own campus, Charles Csuri confronted many obstacles when he sought to explore computer applications for art making during the 1960s. Although computer scientists supported Csuri 's interdisciplinary exploration of ideas, the same was not true of faculty in his home department. The vision of artists, designers, and scientists working within the same environment has now been realized on our campus under the umbrella of the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design( ACCAD). Reaching that goal, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years. Today, ACCAD is among the most successful computer visualization and animation programs in the nation, and it has a prominent international standing. Graduate students who study at ACCAD work with faculty and staff to produce creative works that simply could not be undertaken without close association with the computer science community on our campus. Furthermore, students benefit because under its current director, Wayne Carlson, ACCAD attracts professional staff from the Ohio Supercomputer Center as well as researchers and students from many fields, including : <p> aeronautical engineering, architecture, studio art, art education, art history, city and regional planning, cognitive science, computer and information science, dance, design, industrial systems engineering, geodetic sciences, instructional design and technology, medicine, music, speech and hearing, and theatre. <p> Other contemporary researchers have also been discouraged from engaging in more than one arts or design discipline. A case was cited recently by Maya Lin in an interview about the installation of a new sculptural work she created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked to explain why, as the well-known architect of the Vietnam War Memorial, she also made sculpture, Maya Lin replied : <p> Ten years ago, people who were trying to do more than one thing were met with a lot of suspicion, but that 's changed. Somehow it seems very human to do several things that have to do with one another. I love architecture and I love sculpture, and I could never choose. Sculpture to me is poetry ; and architecture, is like creating a novel. 28 <p> These examples suggest that we need to provide more support for the exploration of ideas beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the past, we have resisted supporting this exploration, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes quite deliberately. That resistance is gradually lessening as many programs in the arts at universities strive to become increasingly interdisciplinary. The same progression towards interdisciplinary inquiry can be found in some K-12 arts programs, but overall that progress has been constrained by the dominant disciplinary structure in which arts teachers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts and Design Curricula <p> If our goal is that students should meaningfully connect information within and between disciplines, we need to question the tradition of organizing curricula in any way that inhibits interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary inquiry. Academic departments in colleges and universities and independent institutions of higher education are structured to preserve and perpetuate the disciplines they represent. That effort is desirable because advanced learning and expertise is specialized in nature and because " disciplines do continually turn up better ways of construing reality -- better not because they correspond more closely to reality, but because they enlarge our field of vision, equipping us with tools for doing things " that were previously beyond our imagination. 29 <p> At the same time, rigid allegiance to a discipline or subdiscipline can inhibit the creation and understanding of important knowledge. When students see themselves as members of a narrow area of specialization, we can not be sure that they are prepared to take full advantage of new ideas and relevant knowledge in other fields. <p> The only intelligent way to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossdisciplinary collaboration. This is not easy when we are simultaneously pressured to respond to the growing volume of disciplinary knowledge in our own fields. The problem is, however, not insurmountable when we consider that university faculty members are proficient at exploring. ideas through their own research, often in directions that move beyond disciplinary boundaries or have the potential to do so. <p> If our goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators in our respective disciplines and future teachers who will lead others to understand those innovations, we will need to develop new strategies and technologies for helping our students organize, evaluate, and cross link knowledge of the past to emerging ideas of the present. 30 That might be best accomplished if we took full advantage of the fact that as faculty members in institutions of higher education, we are the ones who help advance disciplinary knowledge. As researchers, we can and should lead our students to discover how and why new ideas emerge in the field by engaging in research that is closely linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research-based or inquiry-based models of teaching is that they can place as much emphasis on researching what is already known in the discipline as they do on discovering what is yet unknown. As experienced researchers, college or university faculty members can function as the source of current knowledge in the discipline and as leaders in directing the search for new ideas. Instead of viewing the curriculum as a " fixed agenda, " we might think of it as a matrix or map or network of big ideas. <p> Working from such a matrix or map provides us with an overall sense as opposed to a linear sense of direction, where one topic follows another. The teacher 's task, given the matrix or network view of curriculum, extends beyond that of a manager or orchestrator who ensures that things unfold as planned. Rather than remain above the fray, teachers work alongside students, serving as a kind of " cross-country guide " as they explore the territory mapped out by the network of big ideas. 31 <p> Approaching teaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but it would require structuring the curriculum somewhat differently. 32 Learning Through Collaborative Research <p> To some faculty members in the arts and design, the thought of merging teaching with research may seem overly restrictive -- perhaps limiting the personal exploration and expression of ideas that are so important to creative disciplines. However, as artists and scholars who teach, we should welcome the opportunity to distinguish our work from that produced by independent artists and scholars who can not as readily capitalize on what students can bring to the creation of new knowledge. <p> There are countless examples of students in the arts who have played important roles in contributing to creative and scholarly thinking. This is particularly true in performance disciplines, such as contemporary dance, because performance is almost always a collaborative activity. My colleague, Vickie Blaine, who chairs the Department of Dance at Ohio State University, tells me that her work in solving compositional problems has been greatly influenced by students over the years. Blaine looks at her students as individuals with unique perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nurturing. She fosters an atmosphere of learning in which her students draw ideas from one another, and she expects to learn from her students in the process of teaching. The end result is that a choreographer like Bebe Miller, one of Blaine 's many successful former students, now often uses a collaborative framework for creating new works with the dancers in her own professional company. <p> Another example of collaborative inquiry between professor and student can be found in the history of music education. In the preface to his seminal book, Harmonielehre( 1911), composer Arnold Schoenberg describes how he worked to blur the line between teaching and research : <p> This book I have learned from my pupils. In my teaching I never sought merely " to tell the pupil what I know. " Better to tell him what he did not know.... The teacher must have the courage to admit his own mistakes. He does not have to pose as infallible, as one who knows all and never errs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps sometimes finding.... Successful completion of assignments by the pupils established the soundness of my efforts without luring me into the fallacy that I had solved the problem definitively. And I think neither the pupils nor I have fared badly that way. Had I told them merely what I know, then they would have known just that and nothing more. As it is, they know perhaps even less. But they do know what matters : the search itself! 33 <p> Many other faculty members in the arts commonly use highly interactive and individualized teaching practices. More than most other higher education fields, the arts and design have a tradition of blurring the line between teaching and research. Much of our teaching directly engages students in the act of interpretation, problem solving, decision making, and other active learning experiences. <p> But we are not without our faults. We also lapse into didactic teaching methods on occasion. And sometimes we are so process oriented that we neglect to teach our students much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and for creating new works. Thus, one of our challenges as policymakers is to explore how to better integrate the disciplinary knowledge of the past into curriculum standards that are trying to anticipate the future. That future is likely to place growing importance on the institutional context in which our teaching and research takes place. Acknowledging Different Contexts for Disciplinary Inquiry <p> Clearly, higher education does not currently have the resources to support the full scope of inquiry possible in arts and design disciplines. The forecast for future support is not encouraging. Even the largest comprehensive research universities are discovering that they can not do everything. In the years ahead, all institutions of higher education will have to find greater focus to cope with increasingly expansive disciplines. This poses an even more serious problem for K-12 education. <p> If new knowledge continues to grow as projected, we will need to escalate our search for ways to make the best possible use of limited human and capital resources. It makes most sense to do so by planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique about the context in which that teaching and research occurs -- the particular college or university setting as well as the broader community in which that institution exists. Most institutions already do this to some extent, but we will need to intensify our efforts. This includes challenging the very idea of " the core curriculum. " <p> At present, " the core " is that part of our curriculum that replicates what is taught at other institutions offering the same degree program. That is the very nature of accreditation standards. Some policymakers in higher education argue that a standardized model of core-degree requirements is the best way to preserve and perpetuate disciplinary knowledge. Many other faculty members argue that it is increasingly difficult to find a disciplinary core, while future K-12 teachers leave our teacher education programs thinking that " the core " is absolute -- what is fundamental to understanding an arts discipline is not subject to change. <p> The further expansion of disciplinary knowledge will tempt some educators to enlarge the core curriculum. A negative consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn what can be uniquely gained from the institution they are attending. It might be wiser to replace the idea of a core that replicates other degree programs with a core that gives focus to specializations that reflect the unique strengths of a particular department, college, university, and professional community. Rather than working to create and disseminate knowledge within self-contained programs, we might build articulated networks of complementary programs across many institutions. Such articulation could ensure that disciplinary knowledge is covered in depth and breadth by a network of institutions -- not by each accredited institution in and of itself. New technologies give us the means to make this possible if we want it to happen. <p> I am suggesting that programs offered at large universities should look very different from those offered at small liberal arts colleges, conservatories for the performing arts, and independent schools of art and design. For instance, arts curricula at universities might give particular emphasis to new technologies and to interdisciplinary study, playing up the rich opportunities that exist at universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universities, because they are so diverse in the disciplines they teach and support, provide atypical forums for artistic growth.... They provide through their great diversity an unusual opportunity for interdisciplinary study, not only among artists, but between artists and scholars in what may have been mutually exclusive areas of study -- certainly disciplines that would never have been taught in conservatories or schools of beaux-arts. 34 <p> Schools of art and design and conservatories also have resources that are uniquely their own. For instance, many independent schools of art and design are advantaged by the fact that they are colocated with major museum collections, and/or they are closely affiliated with professional arts and design organizations. <p> Similar pressures on " the core curriculum " within K-12 education have led some schools to reduce or eliminate arts education programs. Those in higher education must not forget that their definition of " the core " often sets de facto standards for elementary and secondary schools. Therefore, if universities move toward building curricula around focused disciplinary and interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to help K-12 educators build compatible, though not identical, curricular structures. It seems certain that the current quest for comprehensiveness in all facets of K-12 and higher education curricula will become increasingly less feasible as disciplinary knowledge expands in all fields, including the arts. Conclusion <p> The production of new knowledge is valuable because it broadens our vision, enhances our own understanding, and nurtures innovation, " yet the sheer volume of the data amassed makes almost inevitable the reduction of our focus to what is in the end a very narrow endeavor. " 35 Arts policymakers in higher education must take account of this problem. We must <p> address much more seriously the consequences of the explosion of knowledge, its specialization and fragmentation. It is not enough just to be a contributor to the expansion of knowledge. Unorganized, unrelated, and uninterpreted knowledge becomes inaccessible. It loses its potential and erodes commitment to the value of knowledge. 36 <p> As arts disciplines expand, it becomes increasingly important that we prepare our students to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining questions generated by themselves and others, and to understand how those questions relate to existing disciplinary knowledge. We must take steps to revisit current educational practices. To start, we should acknowledge that " schooling, with its continual emphasis on the answering of questions as the immediate goal of learning, may be defeating the development of expertise in all but the most hardy students. " 37 Policymakers should find ways to support the acquisition of knowledge and skills through interactive, research-based inquiry. We need to remind ourselves that elementary and secondary teachers will not approach teaching the arts as disciplinary and interdisciplinary inquiry if they, themselves, do not fully understand the arts as forms of thinking and knowing. Likewise, we can not expect K-12 arts teachers to teach through research-based inquiry if those opportunities were absent from their own learning experiences. By learning how their professors draw upon expertise in related fields, our students can build a strong foundation for extending and applying disciplinary knowledge long after graduation. <p> Reaching that goal will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of learning. The very idea that the acquisition of knowledge is an interpretive act is foreign to many students, including those pursuing university degrees. John McPherson vividly captures this problem in one of his cartoon series, Close to Home. He pictures a student, named Wayne Merlman, who is hard at work studying a book on the history of the Magna Carta. The cartoon caption states, " Unable to find a Hi-Liter, Wayne Merlman used a black Magic Marker to cross out all the stuff he did n't want to read again. " We see from the cartoon illustration that the only thing Wayne thinks worth remembering is that " The Magna Carta was signed in 1215. " 38 Unfortunately, many students in higher education, like Wayne, think that learning requires rote memorization of factual information or the mindless acquisition of technical skills. Some of these students are studying the arts, and a subset of these students will one day become elementary and secondary arts teachers. <p> We should look at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to traditional routes. <p> The amazing developments in information technology offer quite wonderful avenues for our inventiveness. Perhaps their most important contribution is their reframing of the dimensions of possibility. 39 <p> For instance, when it is impractical for students to engage in research-based inquiry with faculty because of the lack of space, equipment, materials, and time, we now have the means to use or invent new interactive technologies to simulate a research learning environment -- one that comes close to erasing the line between research and teaching. <p> The curricular divisions, core degree requirements, and institutional independence, which have served us so well historically, will need to be revisited to face the demands of teaching increasingly vast bodies of disciplinary knowledge. With greater production of knowledge in the future comes a greater responsibility for us to teach the significance of that knowledge, or the lack thereof. It seems inevitable that we should look to other institutions to share that responsibility, rather than attempting to go it alone. <p> <p>
