4004141 Guest Editors <p> There can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our own technologies. -- Marshall McLuhan, The Gutenberg Galaxy, 1962 <p> <p> Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. -- Arthur C. Clarke, Ascent to Orbit, 1984 <p> <p> The invention and diffusion of the computer are arguably the defining social, economic, and geographical processes of the late twentieth century. The technical developments are many, but four are crucial : more computers ; more computer power evident in processor speed, graphic capabilities, and memory ; an increasing interconnection of computers into networks that make possible communication, data acquisition, software sharing, information processing, and remote storage ; and an ever more placelike interface that lets users command iconic and graphic representations that feel natural or self-evident( at least to those who are comfortable with digital technology). In the aftermath of the microelectronics revolution, the current trend is toward a society that is dependent on computers across the realms of commerce, cultural production, politics, education, and even friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of living in a digital environment, and terms such as cyberspace and electronic cafe imply an environment that may be understood in geographically resonant terms. <p> Although concepts of cyberspace and electronic virtual place have been explored from the perspectives of media theory, architecture, sociology, literary theory, popular culture, and law, geographers have written relatively little on these topics( Lanham 1993 ; Rheingold 1993 ; Cavazos and Morin 1995 ; Mitchell 1995 ; Rushkoff 1995 ; Turkle 1995 ; Shields 1996). A growing and important literature on geography and mass communication examines film, television, and the news media( Gould 1984 ; Brooker-Gross 1985 ; Burgess 1985, 1987 ; Gold 1985 ; Smith 1985 ; Youngs 1985 ; Monmonier 1989 ; Adams 1992 ; Aitken and Zonn 1994). <p> Geographers have studied other kinds of media, including telephone, photography, and geographical information systems( Abler 1977 ; Martin 1991 ; Cosgrove 1994 ; Pickles 1995). Others delve into commercial connections( Langdale 1989 ; Hepworth 19go ; Sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the reconstruction of urban space around communication systems( Castells 1996-1998 ; Graham and Marvin 1996). Manuel Castells has played a particularly important role in situating communication technologies within contemporary capitalism, which, he argues, has created a dominant " space of flows "( Castells 1996-1998). David Harvey conjoins capitalism and communication media to the " annihilation of space through time "( 1989,1990). Although geographers have, for the most part, shied away from the ebullient technological determinism and utopian views of cultural evolution that pervade so much literature on this topic, the discipline has paid insufficient attention to the cultural and political dimensions of computer networking. The collection of articles in this special issue of the Geographical Review begins to fill that void. WEAVING THE NET <p> In 1969 a U.S. Department of Defense project founded under the auspices of the Advanced Research Projects Agency( ARPA) created Arpanet, the first computer network( Hafner and Lyon 1996). Originally the system connected only four computers, situated at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the University of California, Santa Barbara ; and the University of Utah, in Salt Lake City. Arpanet was supported by an innovative technique of data transmission called Packet switching, which allowed a communications system to operate with no central control : " each packet and the entire network of routers all know how to get information around "( Rheingold 1993,75). If one route between locations was eliminated by the loss of a computer or telephone line, packet-switched messages were automatically rerouted along another. The system 's components may be fragile wires, but its function is quite resilient. Ironically, whereas packet switching was designed to preserve the continuity of central military command and intelligence in the event of a nuclear attack, the technique has supported anarchical structures in the public domain, still evident in the lack of editorial control of Internet material and the libertarian political bias of cyberspace devotees. <p> During the 1980s Arpanet was tied to many large mainframe computers at universities, research laboratories, and businesses, and its name changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network sponsored by IBM, gained prominence. In addition, private networks were created to manage internal operations at DEC and IBM computer companies and at AT &T.; The National Science Foundation( NSF), under pressure from scientists who were not yet able to gain access to network facilities, established another network called NSFNET. Further portions of the emerging heterogeneous computer communications " backbone "( primary transmission infrastructure) were contributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy under the rubrics Of NSINET and ESNET. <p> This proliferation of networks effectively ended a military dominance in computer networking and broadened the constituency to include scientists and researchers in general. Technical improvement of the Internet backbone continued during the late 1980s with more than a billion dollars ' worth of funding from NSF, DARPA( ARPA 'S successor), and the Department of Commerce 's National Institute of Standards and Technology. In addition, during the 1980s a multitude of local area networks( LANS) sprouted. LANs supported internal computer networking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( WANS) also developed, tying together metropolitan areas, corporations, and certain rural populations. By the late 1980S LANs and WANS were being connected to the Internet in increasing numbers and. provided a major growth spurt for the Internet as a whole. <p> During the 1990s the primary changes have been the rise of computer networking from an obscure technology to an element of popular culture and the growing commercialization of computer networks. So widespread has cyberspace become as a topic for movies, books, and games that William Gibson 's infamous description of it as a " consensual hallucination " seems to have become reality( 1984,51). Although estimating a total count of Internet users in the world is notoriously difficult, the number is now easily in the tens of millions. Foremost in commercialization has been the growth of consumer-oriented services such as America Online, CompuServe, Microsoft Network, Prodigy, Delphi, and GEnie. Between 21 and 23 percent of U.S. adults now use the Internet, although the social and spatial dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 ; Nielsen Media Research 1998 ; Seminerio 1998). Commercialization was accelerated by the readily transmissible and graphic hypertext markup language( HTML), which supports an Internet function called the World Wide Web. The Web is not a network in its own right, but rather a means of transmitting text, images, and even sound and movie files over the Internet. It has facilitated the use of the Internet for many services, including corporate and state public relations, advertising and marketing, education, and the promotion of tourism. VOCABULARY AND TOOLS IN THEORIZING THE NET <p> Assessing the significance of computer networks is difficult. Beyond empirical measures of dollars, machines, and persons involved and structural assessments of corporate dependence on networks, one enters the realms of philosophy and social theory. Questions remain : Is cyberspace a kind of space? How does the shape of human experience shift when it is mediated digitally? What happens to people 's construction of identity when their primary social interactions are on-line? What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political processes affect, and how are they affected by, the new communication in frastructure? How can local standards of what is acceptable and " decent " be reconciled with a medium that provides instant global access to uncensored material? How can individual privacy be protected without providing new opportunities for organized crime? Do computer networks permit the further colonization of daily life by forces of commodification, surveillance, and abstraction? <p> The conceptual vocabulary and theoretical tools of social theory help in addressing these questions. Some of the vocabulary and tools may not be familiar, so a brief introduction may assist nonspecialists in understanding both the social theory and its application to computer networking. Central to many of the articles in this issue is an assumption that texts such as computer network communications( as well as books, films, speeches, maps, advertisements, photographs, and the like) are not simply passive reiterations of an existing social reality ; they are integral to the constitution of society. Collections of texts that revolve around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary cultural analysis. <p> Texts and discourses involve dynamic processes by which society constantly constructs and regulates itself. They legitimate structures of authority and power, and they simultaneously question or resist these same structures. In addition, the ongoing discussions serve as mirrors for the perception of self and Others, supporting individualism, community, and various person-group relationships. Some of these social functions involve human territoriality : It is not possible to designate a spatial boundary, control what occurs within it, or designate a group as insiders without somehow communicating the basic distinctions between here and there, we and they, in and out. Other texts take the form of laws governing local standards, challenging the kinds of images and texts considered obscene and asking what rights government has to acquire information about people 's lives. Even texts that convey a cosmology, a sense of place and space, or an image of landscape may simultaneously work to maintain social order. <p> These ideas -- explored more fully by geographers such as Denis Cosgrove, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention in this collection to issues of meaning : The point is not naively to suppose that there are single identifiable meanings of social texts or to look through texts at a single, universal Truth but to try to understand the complex involvement between texts and social structures and processes. <p> Another key theme is contestation, the interplay of power among various groups in society. Interplay is more appropriate than struggle in this connection, because struggle implies something grim and survivalist, whereas contestation is not always so deadly serious. It is present, for example, in the gamelike way in which employees appropriate time and resources for their own uses in a work environment and in even the most felicitous relationships between the sexes. Contestation is both inevitable and ambivalent : inevitable because society implies structure, which creates tensions that people and organizations work to overcome ; ambivalent because communication may be perceived either as a win-lose proposition( as in a political debate) or as a process of mutual elucidation in which both sides make meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of consensus or mutual insight. <p> In this special issue, computer-mediated discourses are the source of contestation that is of interest, and the specific interest lies in how the medium( computers) and its arrival in society affect the nature of the contestation, favoring certain tactics over others. Of interest also is how the Internet reflects disparities in development and global power imbalances in the unevenness of access. This would appear to augment existing global power imbalances, but observation of groups that are benefiting politically from the Internet shows a tendency, at least at times, to promote the political aims of geographically peripheral regions and politically peripheral groups : See the articles by Shannon O'Lear, Oliver Froehling, Stanley D. Brunn and Charles D. Cottle, Michele H. Jackson and Darren Purcell, and Barney Warf and John Grimes. <p> Finally, there is the matter of the difference between computer networks and other types of communication. The distinctive character of Internet communications for geographers comes from the Net 's merging of three basic characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sender or a receiver. Second is instantaneity : Delays relate more to the speed of the processor used by the remote computer than to the distance of any browsed site. Third is transnationalism : Embargoing distant computer links is difficult without severing all outside telephone connections and thereby crippling economic development. Some of these characteristics may be shared with other media, such as the telephone and radio, but computer networks exhibit these characteristics to a unique degree. Furthermore, the World Wide Web provides a basis for multiple languages -- textual, graphic, photographic, and cartographic -- circulating at a transnational scale in a multidirectional and instantaneous manner. THE CONTENT OF THIS ISSUE <p> The articles are arranged in a sequential, conceptual progression. The first two address epistemological questions about the meaning and nature of geographical space and reality when manifested in the form of cyberspace and virtual reality. Paul C. Adams examines how popular descriptions of computer networking relate to traditional concepts of space and place. Jonathan Taylor catalogues the facts and implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Completing this section, Paul F. Starrs tracks new and exotic forms of regionalism that arise in a cyberspace which is regarded by some with an escalating skepticism. <p> The next two essays explore representations of specific places. Here the idea of social contestation through electronic texts is implicit, rather than explicit as in the previous studies. Attention is given, instead, to the details of the texts : Web sites devoted to the portrayal of place for distant Web surfers. Michele H. Jackson and Darren Purcell examine the conflicting representations of the Balkan countries by various private and governmental groups. Stanley D. Brunn and Charles D. Cottle consider boosterism by small states such as Singapore, Slovenia, Western Samoa, and Costa Rica. <p> The final articles address matters that are central to political geography, primarily, the idea of the Internet as a terrain of social contestation. Barney Warf and John Grimes present an overview of contestation on the Internet and provide numerous examples of socially marginal movements that have used the Net for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transborder organization by a grassroots environmental movement working across the Russia-Estonia border. And Oliver Froehling reveals the way in which Internet communications were deployed to assist the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, Mexico, despite the absence of computers and Internet access in that remote area. CLOSING COMMENTS <p> The rapid growth of the Internet, exceeded only by a hyperbolic rise in its popularity, has left this topic surprisingly uncharted by geographers. Cyberspace in all its guises -- as a topic of discourse, a contested arena of power, a site of advertising, a mode of personal interaction, and a source of professional information-will continue to play an important role in the unfolding of daily life and social relationships in the foreseeable future. just as the impact of the telephone could hardly have been predicted by Alexander Graham Bell 's contemporaries or of the printed Bible by Gutenberg 's, the effects of the Internet and related technologies will reverberate in unexpected ways throughout numerous domains of public and private life over the course of the next century. The digitization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have profound influences culturally, economically, and geographically. It is to mapping this newly emergent terra incognita that this issue of the Geographical Review is devoted. <p>
