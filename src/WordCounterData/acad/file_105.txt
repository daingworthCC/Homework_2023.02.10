4015441 Section : FEATURES <p> The study reported here looked at the survival of microorganisms( heterotrophic plate counts, total conforms. E. coli, and bacterial spores) in a consumer-type microwave oven. Kitchen sponges, scrubbing pads, and syringes were experimentally contaminated with wastewater and subsequently exposed to microwave radiation. At 100 percent power level, it was found that the heterotrophic plate count( i.e., total bacterial count) of the wastewater was reduced by more that 99 percent within 1 to 2 minutes, and the total coliform and E. coli were totally inactivated after 30 seconds of microwave radiation. Bacterial phage MS2 was totally inactivated within 1 to 2 minutes, Spores of Bacillus cereus were more resistant than the other microorganisms tested, and were completely eradicated only after 4-minute irradiation. Similar inactivation rates were obtained in wastewater-contaminated scrubbing pads, <p> Microorganisms attached to plastic syringes were more resistant to microwave irradiation than those associated with kitchen sponges or scrubbing pads. It took 10 minutes for total inactivation of the heterotrophic plate count and 4 minutes for total inactivation of total coliform and E. coli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 minutes ; 97.4 percent reduction was observed after 12 minutes. The authors also observed a higher inactivation of B. cereus spores in syringes placed in a ceramic container than of spores in syringes placed in a glass container. This finding could have some implications for the design of containers to be used in exposure of medical devices to microwave radiation. <p> The article discusses the implications of these findings for consumer safety in the home environment. Introduction <p> Food is a vehicle for the transmission of numerous infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminth parasites. In the United States, it is estimated that foodborne illnesses affect some 6 to 80 million people per year, leading to approximately 9,000 deaths( Altekruse, Cohen, &; Swerklow, 1997). In the United States, the cost of foodborne diseases has been estimated at $4 - 6 billion. According to Roberts( 1982), the highest percentages of cases occur in the home environment. <p> The domestic kitchen represents an important source of contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerba, 1997 ; Finch, Prince, &; Hawksworth, 1978 ; Scott &; Bloomfield, 1990 ; Scott, Bloomfield, &; Barlow, 1984 ; Rusin, Orosz-Coughlin, &; Gerba, 1998). Cross-contamination of kitchen surfaces was found to be caused by contaminated eggshells( Humphrey, Martin &; Whitehead, 1994). Infectious microorganisms originating from raw meal, poultry, fruits, and vegetables contaminate sinks, countertops, sponges, dishcloths, utensils, and draining and cutting boards. An examination of cellulose sponges and cotton dishcloths showed that they harbored pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella( 15.4 percent of samples for sponges and 13.8 percent for dishcloths) and Staphylococcus aureus( 20 percent of samples for sponges and 18.6 percent for dishcloths). Rusin and co-authors( 1998) reported that sponges and dishcloths are the most problematic in terms of microbial contamination. <p> Sponges and dishcloths remain wet in the kitchen environment, a condition that helps in the survival of potential pathogens. Air drying can not be relied upon to inactivate microorganisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suggested the use of hypochlorite solutions to disinfect sponges and dishcloths( Scott et al., 1984 ; Rusin et al., 1998), the use of self-disinfecting sponges( Enriquez et al., 1997). <p> The home health care industry has approximately 20,000 providers in the United States( up from 1,100 in 1963). It delivers home care services to about 7.6 million patients with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or terminal illnesses. In 2003, the cost of home care was around $38 billion( National Association for Home Care and Hospice, 2004). Home care patients use a wide range of medical devices( e.g., catheters, tracheotomy tubes, nasogastric tubes, syringes), which may become contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. The pathogens form biofilms on the surface of medical devices and become resistant to antibacterial and antifungal drugs, thus leading to urinary-tract infections and other problems( Anwar &; Costerton, 1992 ; Donlan, 2002). Medical instruments and equipment must be sterilized to protect the spread of pathogens from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home care patients generate infectious wastes that are disposed of in household garbage. This circumstance leads to an increase of the pathogen and parasite load in municipal solid waste, with potential for public health problems. <p> Microwave radiation falls within the radio-frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most studies on microwave radiation have primarily addressed the effect of radiation on microorganisms associated with food( Farber, Aoust, Diotte, Sewell, &; Daley, 1998 ; Spite, 1984). Microbial suspensions were used in most of the studies dealing with microbial inactivation by microwave irradiation( e.g., Kakita el al., 1995 ; Wang, Hu, &; Lin, 2003). The research reported here also dealt with microorganisms associated with surfaces, especially those adsorbed to plastic-syringe surfaces. <p> The purpose of the research was to determine the effects of microwave radiation produced by a household microwave oven on the survival of bacterial indicators, phage, and bacterial endospores in wastewater-contaminated kitchen sponges and scrubbing pads, as well as medical devices such as syringes used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Microwave irradiation was performed in a household microwave oven( Sharp, Model R-630D) with a rotating glass plate, a frequency of 2,450 MHz, and power of 1,100 watts. This microwave oven had 11 power levels ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent. Thermometers <p> Two types of thermometers were used. A digital. Type K thermocouple thermometer( Omega, Model HH21) was used to measure temperatures inside liquids, kitchen sponges, and scrubbing pads. A noncontact infrared thermometer( Raytekr) was used to measure temperature on the surface of objects. Test Microorganisms <p> Total coliforms and E. coli were enumerated by the ColiPADT rapid detection method described by Billon, Koopman, and Jung( 1995). <p> Briefly, following serial dilutions of the samples, a 1-mL aliquot of each dilution was added to 1 mL of 2X Lauryl Tryptose BrothMUG( LTB-MUG). The lubes were incubated for 22 hours at 35C. Following incubation, a 10-L aliquot from each tube was transferred to the ColiPAD assay pads. These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) and 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide( MUG), for the rapid detection of total coliforms and E. coli, respectively( Bitton et al., 1995). The pads were placed in locking empty petri dishes and incubated for 2 hours at 35C. Purple spots on assay pads indicate the presence of total coliforms in samples. To detect E. coli, a 10-L drop of the alkaline buffer **27;4797;TOOLONG( Sigma Diagnostics) was added to each spot. Fluorescence spots on assay pads indicate the presence of E. coli under a long-wave ultraviolet( UV) lamp in the dark. The method gave the most probable numbers of total coliforms and E. coli per 100 mL of sample. <p> Total bacteria colonies were detected on nutrient agar plates incubated for 48 hours at 30C <p> Bacillus cereus was used to determine the effect of microwave irradiation on bacterial spores in contaminated materials. The vegetative cells were routinely cultured in tryptic soy agar( or broth)( Difco Laboratories). Spores were produced by cultivation of the bacteria at 37C in 1/10-strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from vegetative ceils by preincubation in a water bath at 37C followed by shaking of the spore suspension in a water bath at 60C for 15 minutes. The spores were plated on nutrient agar supplemented with 0.1 percent soluble starch and 0.015 g/L of trypan blue, and incubated at 37C for 24 hours( Nieminski, 2002 ; Nieminski, Bellamy, &; Moss, 2000 ; Radziminski et al., 2002). <p> Bacterial endospores in wastewater from the University of Florida water reclamation plant were enumerated according to a slightly modified methodology proposed by Nieminski( 2002). <p> MS2 phage was obtained from Dr. Sam Farrah of the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida. The host cell used was E. coli C3000. The phage was assayed according to the double-layer technique of Adams( 1959). Kitchen Sponges <p> The kitchen sponges were 3.17 x 3.37 x 0.69 cm when dry. The average water-holding capacity of sponges was 64.3 g. To contaminate dry sponges, the authors soaked them in raw wastewater from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contaminated sponges to microwave radiation, wastewater was squeezed from the exposed sponges. Serial dilutions of the squeezed wastewater were made and plated on the appropriate media( see above) to enumerate total bacteria, total coliforms, E. coli, and bacterial endospores. A similar protocol was used for MS2 phage and B. cereus spores. <p> Control sponges were also soaked in wastewater but were not exposed to microwave radiation. Kitchen Scrubbing Pads( Nonmetallic) <p> The scrubbing pads were 9.06 x 7.07 x 0.65 cm when dry. The size of the pads did not change significantly following soaking in liquids. The water-holding capacity of the pads was 10.94 g. The inactivation experiments were conducted according to the protocol described for kitchen sponges. Syringes <p> The goal of these experiments was to simulate the fate of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms in contaminated syringes following exposure to microwave radiation. The microorganisms under study are those that remain attached to the syringe walls. To simulate microbial contamination, 10-mL sterile plastic syringes were filled with 10 mL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 minutes. Afterwards, the syringes were emptied and exposed to microwave irradiation. The adsorbed microorganisms were desorbed from the syringe walls with 10 mL of an eluent that contained 3 percent beef extract solution and 0.1 percent Tween 80( pH = 7). The eluent solution was in contact with the syringe wails for 90 minutes. The eluate was diluted and plated to determine the number of survivors according to the methods described above. Statistical Analyses <p> Statistical Package for Social Science( SPSS) for Windows was used to determine the effects of microwave irradiation on various microorganisms. An a-level of.05 was used for each analysis to determine the statistical significance evaluated by paired t-test. Results Temperature Profile with Varying Microwave Power Level <p> 100 mL of deionized water was placed in a 250-mL Pyrex beaker at the center of the rotating plate in the microwave oven and exposed to microwave radiation at different power levels for one minute. Figure 1 shows the temperature profile with increasing power level. The temperature increased in 1 minute from 23.2C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level. Kakita and co-authors( 1995) reported a similar increase in water temperature( 26C to 90C) following 1-minute irradiation. <p> The experiments discussed below were carried out at 100 percent power level. Microbial Inactivation in Kitchen Sponges <p> The mean surface temperature of the sponges ranged from 79.4C after 1 minute to 80.8C at 4 minutes, and the mean inside temperature ranged from 91.4C after 1 minute to 90.4C after 4 minutes( Figure 2). <p> The extent to which different microorganisms in contaminated sponges were inactivated after microwave radiation is shown in Table 1. For total bacteria, inactivation was 99.1 0.2 percent and 99. 5 0.1 percent after 1- and 2-minute irradiation, respectively. The levels of total coliforms and E. coli in wastewater were 2.2 x 10 6 per 100 mL and 9 x 10 4 per 100 mL, respectively. Complete inactivation of these indicators was obtained following only 30 seconds of microwave treatment at 100 percent power level. Similarly, complete inactivation of phage MS2 was achieved following 1-minute microwave irradiation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 10 9 per mL. <p> Kitchen sponges were soaked in a Bacillus cereus spore suspension. As expected, bacterial spores were hardier then the other microorganisms under study. A 2-minute microwave irradiation period was enough to inactivate 99.99 percent of bacterial spores, and no spore survived after 4 minutes of irradiation. Surface temperature of the sponges rose to 87.2C after 4 minutes( Table 1). <p> Wastewater from the UF water reclamation facility was found to harbor 5.7 x 10 4 bacterial spores per 100 mL. When exposed to microwave radiation, spore inactivation was 99.4 percent after 1 minute and 100 percent after 1.5 minutes( Table 1). Microbial Inactivation in Kitchen Scrubbing Pads <p> Microbial inactivation in scrubbing pads showed the same pattern as microbial inactivation in sponges( Table 1). A 2-minute irradiation time resulted in a 4-log reduction in total bacteria, and no bacteria were detected after 4-minute irradiation. Complete inactivation of total coliforms and E. coli was achieved following 1-minute irradiation. The temperature inside the scrubbing pads increased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rising costs of hospital care, home care of patients is becoming increasingly attractive. It was therefore important to study the effect of microwave irradiation on microorganisms associated with medical devices( e.g., syringes) that are often disposed of in the patient 's home garbage. In syringes, the microbial pathogens are likely to adhere to the plastic and rubber surfaces. <p> Experiments were undertaken to study the fate of syringe-associated microorganisms following microwave irradiation. Sterile, 10-cc syringes were filled with wastewater and then emptied following 90 minutes of contact time at room temperature. The empty syringes with attached microorganisms were then exposed to microwave irradiation. <p> It was observed that microorganisms attached to syringe surfaces were generally more resistant than those associated with kitchen sponges or scrubbing pads. After a 10-minute exposure time, the surface temperature of syringes exposed to microwave radiation climbed to around 120C for the main polyethylene body and 130C for the rubber end of the syringe piston( Figure 3). For total coliforms and E. coli, a 2-minute exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent inactivation, respectively. No survivor organisms were detected after a 4-minute exposure, however( Figure 4, Figure 5). The surface temperature of syringes rose to 86.4C in 4 minutes when syringes were exposed to microwave irradiation. It took 7 minutes, however, to achieve a 4-log reduction of total bacteria, and total inactivation was obtained only after 10-minute irradiation( Table 2). Exposure periods of 1 and 2 minutes resulted in 3- and 4-log inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage, respectively. <p> As shown for kitchen sponges and scrubbing pads, Bacillus cereus spores were hardier than vegetative bacteria. The average extent of inactivation was 86.5 4.6 percent after 7-minute exposure and 97.4 3.4 percent after 12-minute exposure. The surface temperature ranges after 7 minutes and 12 minutes were 86.4-105.2C and 107.2-123.6C, respectively. Effect of Container Type on Inactivation of B. cereus Spores Adhering to Syringe Surfaces <p> Syringes contaminated with B. cereus spores were placed either in a glass container or in a ceramic bowl( i.e., a household clay bowl) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the glass container, the surface temperature increased up to 76.8-89.2C, whereas in the ceramic container, the surface temperature was always above 100C( 115.8-176.4C). This greater increase in temperature was probably responsible for the increase in average inactivation from 84.1 percent to 95.8 percent( Figure 6). Discussion and Conclusions <p> The study showed that total bacteria and indicator organisms are inactivated by microwave radiation within 1 to 2 minutes. A 5-log reduction of the viable count was also reported for E. coli suspension exposed to full power( 600 waits) in 80 seconds( Woo, Rhee, &; Park, 2000). Park and Cliver( 1997) reported up to a 7-log reduction of pure cultures of E. coli in sponges subjected to microwave radiation( at 800 watts) within 30 to 60 seconds. <p> Sponges, pads, and dishcloths in kitchens retain moisture and are potential sources of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria( Enriquez, Enriquez-Gordillo, Kennedy, &; Gerba, 1997 ; Rusin et al., 1998). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) have reported loofah sponges to be reservoirs and vehicles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes folliculitis. Sponges are generally left to dry on kitchen surfaces, but drying is not sufficient to significantly inactivate microbial pathogens, particularly microbial spores and protozoan cysts and oocysts( Scott &; Bloomfield, 1990). Placing the contaminated sponges in a microwave oven for a few minutes will significantly inactivate potential pathogens. <p> The study reported here also showed that microorganisms attached to syringe surfaces were generally more resistant than those associated with kitchen sponges or scrubbing pads. Total inactivation of the syringe-associated bacteria was achieved only after an exposure period of 4 to 10 minutes. Similarly, a 2-minute exposure of phage MS2 did not result in total inactivation. Phage MS2 appears to be more resistant than Phage PL-1, for which a 5-log reduction was achieved in about 1 minute( Kakita et al., 1995). Thus, wastewater microorganisms in liquid-saturated kitchen sponges and scrubbing pads are more sensitive to microwave treatment than are those attached to syringe surfaces, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to provide a protective effect. <p> As expected, the authors found that bacterial spores displayed a higher resistance to microwave radiation than did vegetative bacteria or bacterial phages, Because of their generally higher resistance to environmental stresses, it has been suggested that bacterial spores could be used as potential indicators for protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium( Radziminski et al., 2002). Protozoan cysts and oocysts are generally more resistant than vegetative bacteria or even viruses to disinfection and adverse environmental factors( Bitton, 2005). Moreover, there are differences in the resistance of Bacillus spores( B. licheniformis, B. cereus, B. coagulans, and B. subtilis) to microwave radiation, with B. licheniformis spores having the highest resistance( Wang et al., 2003). <p> Finally, the study reported here showed that the type of container used may have some effect on microbial inactivation in syringes. A higher degree of inactivation was observed when the contaminated syringes were placed in a clay container. An effect of container type on microbial inactivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 2003), who showed that the resistance of microbial spores to microwave radiation was lower in glass containers than in polypropylene containers or aluminum foil-enclosed pouches. These preliminary data suggest the possibility that open or closed ceramic containers could be used to increase the inactivation of microorganisms subjected to microwave radiation. <p> Microwave ovens have become common household appliances in developed countries and, to some extent, in developing countries. This relatively inexpensive technology is commonly used to cook or warm foods in homes, offices, and some restaurants. With respect to consumer safety, the research reported here shows that microwave radiation can also be used to control( to reduce or sometimes to completely eliminate) microbial potential pathogens in the kitchen environment by irradiation of sponges and scrubbing pads for a few minutes. Reports are conflicting as to whether microbial inactivation is due to heating or to the microwave energy itself( Salvatorelli, Marchetti, Betti, Rosaspina, &; Finzi, 1996). Celandroni and co-authors( 2004), however, attributed the killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to lead to the release of DNA and proteins but not to cause cell lysing( Woo et al., 2000). <p> Homebound patients can also use this technology to reduce microbial contamination by exposing nonmetallic medical wastes to microwave radiation. Examples of the successful application of this technology are its use in treatment of infectious hospital wastes, which are commonly subjected to incineration or irradiation with ultraviolet or? -rays( Pellerin, 1994 ; Tata &; Beone, 1995) ; industrial food processing( Aziz, Mahrous, &; Youssef, 2002) ; decontamination of mildew-infected cotton( Chen, 2001), towels( Tanaka el al., 1998), corks in wine bottling( Murphy &; Curran, 2000), and contact lenses( Crabbe &; Thompson, 2001 ; Hiti, Walochnik, Faschinger, Haller-Schober, &; Aspock, 2001) ; dentures cleaning( Goodson, Glass, Bullard, &; Conrad, 2003) ; air decontamination( Hamid et al., 2001) ; and pyrolysis of wastewater biosolids( Menendez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In conclusion, consumers and homebound patients can use microwave ovens to significantly reduce microbial pathogens in the home environment. Microwave irradiation is a cost-effective, practical, fast, easy, and safe method of disinfecting household and medical devices. <p> Acknowledgements : The authors thank the University of Florida Research Foundation for funding this research.
