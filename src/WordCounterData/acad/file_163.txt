4021841 Abstract : This study identified factors that lead to or impede competitive job placements for clients of a state blindness rehabilitation agency. The authors conducted focus groups with the agency 's service providers and administered surveys to adults who are blind or visually impaired and to employers. The survey data analysis compared persons who were employed with persons who were not employed but were interested in working and with persons who were not working and were not interested in working. Also identified were services that employers felt would assist them in hiring or retaining blind or visually impaired workers. Five themes, stated in terms of needs for the agency to address, are presented to summarize the findings. </P> Employment remains an elusive goal for most adults in the United States who are blind or severely visually impaired. However, decades of specialized education, vocational rehabilitation( VR), consumer activism, and nondiscrimination legislation have made the goal seem closer than ever. Nationally, the number and variety of jobs that blind or visually impaired workers hold have exploded over the years( American Foundation for the Blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced the lives of thousands of blind or visually impaired persons( Chiang, Bassi, &; Javitt, 1992 ; Kirchner, 1988), and these workers pay taxes that help to offset public expenditures. Even so, the goal of matching the rates and rewards of employment that sighted persons achieve has not been approximated in the United States( McNeil, 1993). </P> The issues and findings of this 1989 study of workers in Illinois remain highly relevant in 1997, not only as baseline data gathered just before the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act( ADA) and in spite of the intense hopes for rapid change many people had placed on the ADA( Burkhauser &; Daly, 1995). Policy analysts deem it premature to assess the ADA 's effects on overall employment statistics( Kirchner, 1996 ; Pfeiffer, 1996 ; West, 1996) because of its recent and partial implementation. The ADA 's employment provisions did not go into full effect until 1992 and do not apply to firms with fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of American workers( personal communication, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 13, 1995). Of course, the ADA builds on provisions dating back to the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. Nevertheless, national surveys show that very low employment rates and earnings of persons with disabilities have persisted and perhaps even worsened over those decades( Bennefield &; McNeil, 1989 ; Harris, 1986, 1994). Furthermore, Kirchner( 1996) has contested interpreting those data as a measure of the ADA 's success, pointing to more complex factors in the persistence of employment barriers for persons with disabilities( Burkhauser &; Daly, 1994 ; Harlan &; Robert, 1995 ; Yelin, 1992, 1996 ; Yelin &; Katz, 1994). </P> Expectations were raised by legislative and technological advances and have made the goal of blind persons ' matching the employment levels achieved by nondisabled persons seem even more elusive and challenging. This study offers techniques and results, using survey and focus group methods, that continue to show promise as approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that better diagnosis of the problems will help the field tackle them more effectively.( See reports of 1995 and 1996 meetings on employment issues for persons who are blind or visually impaired, with analyses based in part on this Illinois study( American Foundation for the Blind, 1996a ; Johnson, 1995)). </P> Method RESEARCH DESIGN This study was designed to identify key factors that support or impede competitive job placements for clients of the Illinois Bureau of Blind Services. The aim of the bureau staff was to determine which factors it could influence and then to design strategies to build into actual practice. </P> The Illinois Bureau of Blind Services director( second author of this article) contracted the American Foundation for the Blind 's Social Research Unit as an external observer with expertise to gather and analyze systematic input from stockholders -- bureau staff and clients, other blind adults, and employers. </P> Seven focus groups in Chicago, in early 1989, were comprised of, respectively, the bureau 's Chicago-based rehabilitation counselors, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation and mobility( O &M); specialists, rehabilitation teachers, placement specialists, and placement staff of the Chicago Lighthouse who were contracted to serve the bureau 's clients. The 50 participants in these focus groups constituted nearly all of these categories, except for placement specialists, who serve the larger VR department. By being inclusive, this study avoided the problem of nonrepresentative sampling that typically is encountered when focus group results are generalized. </P> The consumer survey consisted of structured telephone interviews in mid-1989 of 264 respondents, including 43 active bureau clients, 75 clients recently " rehabilitated into competitive employment, " and 56 clients who were " not rehabilitated. " The initial sample was drawn randomly from the bureau 's 1986-88 records. This procedure was used to include clients who had received services and had been either working or available for work for varying periods of time. Some nonresponse bias was due to the difficulty of locating and, to a lesser extent, gaining cooperation from " not rehabilitated " clients. Sample responses were weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest closure category, " closed rehabilitated ") and response rates. The tables show both weighted and unweighted base numbers. </P> In addition, 90 blind or visually impaired adults volunteered to be interviewed in response to announcements placed through consumer groups, including the Illinois chapters of the American Council of the Blind, National Federation of the Blind, and Blinded Veterans Association ; radio reading services ; the state 's Talking Books program ; and other specialized service programs in Illinois. </P> Finally, the views of employers were obtained through brief telephone interviews( about five minutes), followed by more extensive mail surveys during winter 1989-90. Respondents included 203 private sector employers by phone and 86 by mail, representing 57 companies, and 64 public sector employers by phone and 30 by mail. The private sector sample had been drawn randomly, stratified by size, from state directories of manufacturing service companies. For the public sector, the sample was stratified by federal( regional offices), state, and local government agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the person who was most involved in personnel policy. In small settings, that respondent usually was the owner ; in larger ones, the personnel director. In very large companies, two respondents were sought : a personnel department staffer and a line supervisor. </P> Even though the researchers tried to raise mail response rates by starting with a telephone interview, the rates were low, especially among small companies. Nonresponse bias probably favored positive findings on employers ' disability policies and practices. The employer survey results will be discussed only briefly and in broad outline. The focus group discussion guide and survey forms are available from the first author, as is the full study report( Kirchner et al., 1991). </P> It is noteworthy that the project itself provided employment for persons with low vision or blindness : a bureau client -- a graduate student with low vision -- was hired as research assistant, three telephone interviewers were blind, and blind transcriptionists handled the focus group tapes.( Bureau staff who had low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated as part of their regular employment.) </P> PROCEDURE Following the principle that action-oriented research should involve the people destined to act on the findings at all stages, the researchers met with the bureau 's director and administrative staff every few weeks or months. They met less often with line staff ; the VR department 's director ; and the Blind Services Planning Council, which has a legislative mandate and strong consumer representation. Thus, stakeholders helped to : 1) define the issues and the research questions ; 2) design the questionnaires ; and 3) most importantly, interpret the results. Such ongoing involvement not only builds commitment to applying the results, it also makes limitations and the reasons for them visible( Patton, 1996). </P> The research design recognized that the employment problem has extremely complex causes, many of which rehabilitation agencies can not affect. The design emphasized those factors that state agencies can control. Barriers or supports to employment were assumed to stem from three sources : </P> 1) VR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes, transportation options, and income benefits systems ; and 3) blind or visually impaired adults themselves, especially with regard to their desire to work, their skills, and their self-confidence. </P> The design assumed that persons from each source could provide valuable information about all three sources. After informal interviews with knowledgeable staff, the researchers conducted focus groups with the agency 's professionals, whose views were then built into the consumer surveys for blind or visually impaired adults and the questionnaires for employers. Four public hearings to elicit input from consumers on the design were sparsely attended in spite of publicity. However, pretest interviews further shaped the consumer survey. The employer questionnaire was based on Harris and Associates '( 1987) national survey of employers. </P> Results OVERVIEW : THEMES AND STRATEGIES To emphasize the practice-oriented data analysis, this section begins by overviewing how the detailed findings were digested into meaningful themes and strategies. </P> Support for each of the themes was found in the provider focus groups or in the consumer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be supported if it fit with findings in more than one of those sources. To highlight the potential for action of the themes, each was stated in terms of a set of needs for the bureau to address. The five themes and examples of strategies( activities) follow. </P> Theme 1 The first theme was the need for improved communication within the agency and in its dealings with clients and employers. Strategies proposed under this heading included : provide information to clients about consumer organizations as possible resources ; set up a toll-free phone-in service ; examine existing public relations materials and strategies to ensure the messages are appropriate and effective, audiences are well-defined, and methods( print, radio, or TV) are chosen to achieve optimal results. </P> In keeping with the outcome evaluation thrust that now is gaining strength( Patton, 1996 ; United Way, 1996) but is still rarely implemented, one strategy called for developing an outcome survey and using it to give direct feedback to staff regarding the effectiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings within regional offices and between the bureau 's director and individual service providers. Another suggested strategy was to develop mechanisms for improved communications with employers. </P> Theme 2 The second theme was the need for improved access to and use of employment-related data by both staff and clients. One innovative strategy that the agency proposed to address this need included the strong commitment to provide employment-related materials in varied media( speech, braille, and large type) to ensure effective access both by staff and by clients. A second proposed strategy was a plan to tie into the state 's general employment assistance computer system, which would also allow both the bureau 's counselors and their clients to research career options and job openings directly. </P> Another strategy proposed under this theme was to develop an intensive short term program for clients that would encompass vocational evaluation, interest assessment, job and training program information, and job interview training. Growing recognition of the importance of client networking and mentoring as sources of employment information was expressed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job-ready clients. Finally, another strategy called for training or retraining the placement specialists in using labor market data and conducting job analyses. </P> Theme 3 The third theme focused on the need for job-ready clients to have the skills to compete for positions and to succeed once they are employed. The proposed strategies addressed the literacy deficiency of clients seeking employment, which is a concern that only now is gaining wide recognition nationally. Literacy was defined to cover reading and writing using, as appropriate, braille, large type, computers with varied outputs, and closed-circuit TVs. </P> Another strategy that targets clients ' travel skills -- training in cane travel and use of public transportation, if available- similarly reveals an emphasis on the need for independent living skills and candid acknowledgment of the inadequacy of current services toward that aim. Training in interviewing for jobs was another targeted skill area, as it was under the second theme. </P> Theme 4 The fourth theme focused on a need recently highlighted for national policy in an article titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Yelin &; Katz, 1994). The Illinois study concluded that a need exists to focus staff efforts in the areas of job placement, transition from school to work, retention of visually impaired individuals in their jobs, and advancement beyond entry level. </P> Proposed strategies included assigning specific counselors to serve in each of the following ways : as placement specialists, as transition specialists working with students, as job retention specialists, and finally, as career advancement specialists. Furthermore, strategies suggested the establishment of placement teams that would include a teacher, a case aide, and a placement specialist for clients who require only placement assistance. Another strategy called for the development of methods and materials to educate eye care professionals and employers about the bureau 's services with emphasis on early referral, before someone loses a job. </P> Theme 5 The fifth and final theme, already touched upon but given separate status to emphasize its importance, was the need to utilize successful blind or visually impaired persons as resources. The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blind individuals around the state so that clients could easily contact persons who were successful in occupations that were of interest to them. This idea built directly on the national " Careers &; Technology Information Bank " maintained at the American Foundation for the Blind( AFB, 1996b). A spin-off strategy was to establish a pool of blind Illinois residents willing to work with clients on job leads and interviewing skills and, in general, to serve as mentors. </P> The broad conclusion drawn from analysis of the focus groups ' comments regarding the agency 's program and structure was that the bureau needed to be clearer and more consistent about its major goals. For example, was the achievement of meaningful employment for clients truly the top priority, from year to year? If so, this priority should be met by ensuring that staff roles were defined and rewarded to support fulfillment of that goal. The themes and strategies, especially the fourth theme, were designed to do just that. </P> CONSUMER SURVEY The consumer survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employment issues for people with disabilities. As stated earlier, the aim was to compare characteristics and attitudes of respondents who were employed with those who were not. However, rather than simply deal with the two groups who differed on the objective feature of employment status, the study introduced an important variable typically missing from such analyses, which is the subjective dimension of interest in employment. </P> Work orientation Three subgroups, who differed in their work orientation, were identified and defined as : 1) people who were working, 44 percent( 27 percent full time and 17 percent part time) ; 2) people who were not working but interested in working for pay( henceforth simply called " interested "), 44 percent ; and 3) people who were not interested in working for pay( " not interested "), 12 percent. </P> Clearly, the great majority of those who were not working were interested in working : Furthermore, the data showed that most of those who were interested had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The minority who expressed little or no interest in working for pay gave reasons based on perceived barriers rather than on distaste for work or preference for nonwork income support. </P> The fact that not all of the VR clients were interested in paid employment was emphasized by service providers in the focus groups. Practitioners argued that clients without a positive work orientation should be considered separately in evaluating client outcomes and provider outputs. Their position is supported by the data in the next section. This distinction does not mean that such clients should not be eligible for VR services, since any individual may change his or her mind ; it does mean that, at any given time, a group exists whose needs must be understood and addressed differently in policy and practice from the needs of those interested in working for pay. The next sections explore the social, disability, work history, and attitudinal characteristics of the three analytic groups. </P> Social characteristics Respondents who were not at all interested in working for pay differed sharply in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in working( see Table 1). As a group, those who were not interested in working were older, less educated, had retirement income, and resided in smaller communities, all of which are characteristics that constitute or reinforce barriers to working. </P> By contrast, social characteristics of those interested in working differed much less from those who were actually working. The differences were due to labor market disadvantage other than disability. Among those who were interested in working( compared to those actually working), a much higher proportion were aged 45 years or older, fewer were college graduates, and more were non-Whites. Their distribution by gender and their household and community situations were similar and thus do not account for why the two groups differed in employment status. More of those not working were receiving income benefits, but many were not. </P> Disability characteristics Respondents who were not interested in working differed sharply from the other two groups in disability characteristics, much as they did in social characteristics( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older at the onset of their vision loss, more likely to have other health problems that they perceived as more limiting than their vision loss, had some useful vision, and about one-third of them reported they were experiencing further vision loss. </P> When disability features of employed respondents are compared with those of respondents who were interested in working, differences are smaller but point to the same employment barriers that were found among those not interested. Interested respondents were more likely than those who were working to have lost vision in middle or later life, to have only " a little useful vision " and to be experiencing further vision loss. More of them have had other health problems, but they were more likely to perceive that vision loss, rather than another health condition, affected their activities. </P> To sum up thus far, it is hardly surprising to learn that blind or visually impaired people who were employed had fewer disadvantages related to social and disability characteristics than did those who were not working. Of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disability characteristics, although present, was generally small between people who were employed and those interested in working, whereas the gap was large between employed people and those who expressed no interest in working. </P> The pattern shifts when the focus turns to group differences in experiences with and attitudes about employment( see Table 3). The most notable difference is in work history. The data reveal that the respondents ' current status was not just temporary -- that is, most people who were employed at the time of the interview had a largely continuous work history since the onset of their vision loss( considering work from age 18 or older). This pattern is in sharp contrast to the predominant lack of employment since onset of vision loss among those who were not working when interviewed. This lack of employment pattern is the one measure that the study examined in which people interested in working and those not interested had almost identical profiles. An important point is that those interested in working were just as likely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vision( if age 18 or older), whereas most of those not interested had either never been in the labor force( for example, had been full-time homemakers) or already considered themselves retired. </P> Clearly the implication is that time out of employment has a cumulative negative effect on re-employment even if one retains interest in working. A secondary implication that applies to the not interested group is that although some of them may have been " discouraged workers "( a labor force statistics term), for most of them, their lack of employment should not be attributed to blindness. Most were not working even before onset of blindness. Therefore, it seems strange to expect them to become work oriented after onset, especially given their social and other disability characteristics. </P> These implications illustrate a frequent problem in disability research and policy -- overattributing causal impact to the disability because related primary variables have been ignored and no comparison group was examined. Regarding the unemployment issue, typical analyses lack the longitudinal perspective, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual measures over time are better( Mudrick et al., 1995). In fact, the Rehabilitation Services Administration has proposed adding " work history " to client records compiled nationally( Rehabilitation Services Administration, 1994). </P> Work settings and other job features This part of the analysis refers to the current job or, for persons interested in work, to their last job. Those not interested were omitted because too few had prior jobs. </P> Two-thirds of the employed respondents worked either in public agencies( 41%) or were self-employed( 25%). Self-employment was much rarer as the last job held by respondents interested in work. The analysis checked the types of self-employment to see if the Randolph-Sheppard vending program was a major source ; it was not. Rather, a wide range of occupations was pursued, from unskilled to professional. Self-employment offered an important option in maintaining continuous work history. Of all those employed, nearly half worked with other disabled people. This high level may reflect a sampling bias, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in work opportunity. </P> Working respondents gave positive ratings to most features of their jobs( especially " interesting work " and " chance to make friends. ") Ratings of current jobs differed little from ratings of the last jobs held by interested respondents, except that the latter rated " job security " and " ease of travel arrangements " notably lower than did currently employed respondents. These data suggest that there is a trade-off between job security and the rewards of salary and chance for promotion. </P> By far the lowest rated feature among both groups was " chance for promotion. " Also, half of those with current jobs reported that they " feel underemployed ; that is, my job does not allow me to use my abilities or training. "( To assess this level, it should be compared with a sighted sample of persons with similar education and work experience). </P> Family attitudes Family attitudes were seen as strongly supportive by those who were working, slightly less so by those who were interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not interested. Nevertheless, curiously, the last group tended to perceive family attitudes toward their becoming employed as more positive than their own attitude. </P> Self-confidence Self-confidence in relation to work was very high among working respondents, slightly lower among those who were interested, and only slightly lower still among those who were not interested( supporting the earlier point that few of the latter group were " discouraged workers. ") However, the groups differed more sharply when it came to whether they felt they possessed the needed " skills to change or improve their work situation. " They also differed sharply in whether they felt " it is difficult to get information about services. " Respondents who were working disagreed much more often than those who were interested and many of those who were not interested said they " do n't know, " suggesting that they had not tried. </P> Nearly all respondents, regardless of their work orientation, had received some rehabilitation services( see Table 4). Most who were working or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas respondents who were " not interested " had not. Most respondents evaluated state services as satisfactory in general but cited one or more specific services with which they were dissatisfied. </P> Receipt of job-related services was most often reported by those who were working, although each service( for example, training in methods of job-finding) was reported by only about one-fifth to one-half of them. Respondents interested in working were less likely to report those services, but some were still clients. Many of those who were interested in working recognized that they needed specific services, especially " help in finding a job, " which was recognized by 50 percent of those who were interested. Among those now working, about 15-20 percent felt that they needed such job-related services, especially job skills and equipment. </P> The need for services regarding adaptive techniques for mobility and for reading and writing were also named more often by respondents interested in working, especially if they had little or no useful vision, than by working respondents with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were for more training in braille and in computers( see Table 5). </P> Finding a job : Sources of problems and of help Asked about three possible sources of problems in finding jobs, working respondents, as well as those interested in working, considered " employer attitudes ' to pose the biggest problem, their " own knowledge about locating jobs " to pose the next biggest problem, and " counselor skills/attitudes " to be least problematic. Interested respondents, nevertheless, blamed both employer attitudes and their own lack of knowledge much more often than did working respondents. Employer discrimination in general, not only in relation to their own job hunt, was perceived as a serious problem, equally by working respondents and by those who were interested in working. Those not interested perceived it less, but half said they " do n't know. " </P> On the positive side, respondents acknowledged many sources of help or advice in finding a job from a list presented to them. " Friends " and " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being used and being helpful ; however, given the many alternatives, each was mentioned by only a minority. There was no notable difference between those working and those interested as to how they ranked sources that helped them find their current or last job, respectively. </P> To sum up in regard to services, considerable need was expressed to improve job relevant skills, especially how to find jobs, by those who were interested in working and even to some extent by those who were working. Respondents were selective about which services they wanted, recognizing the importance of computer literacy and use of special equipment. Those who were not working especially had difficulty learning about services. However, there was a balanced, generally positive attitude toward the state agency as a source for services, to the extent that those services were known. </P> SURVEY OF EMPLOYERS The study revealed that few employer respondents believed that their company had ever been contacted by the state VR agency. Whether or not that was technically correct, clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. </P> The findings highlight employers ' concerns that could be addressed by agencies in job development or placement. A significant majority of the employers felt it was " very important " to have the following types of information regarding a blind or visually impaired job applicant : 1) how he or she works with equipment typically used on the job, 2) how he or she records and retains information, 3) how he or she accesses printed and computer information, and 4) how to provide for an applicant with a dog guide. </P> In regard to blind or visually impaired workers, a substantial majority of employer-respondents considered information or assistance in handling the following situations to be " very important " : 1) providing insurance coverage, 2) terminating a blind employee for unsatisfactory performance, 3) providing ongoing consultation if job requirements change, and 4) providing instruction on how to travel within the workplace. </P> The employer survey also obtained reactions to the potential effectiveness of several policy options designed to promote hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the ADA. Only the two options that involved financial incentives were judged potentially very or somewhat effective. They are : 1) providing federal or state tax credits for hiring persons with disabilities and 2) paying companies for on-the-job training of newly hired disabled workers. All other proposed policies were not well received. </P> As expected, the public sector was more involved than the private sector in employing persons with disabilities ; even so, few public agencies reported having formal programs for such hiring or having been contacted by VR agency staff. Therefore, building better links between employers and the VR profession became an objective for the agency, and was defined as still relevant, if not more so, in the post-ADA environment. </P> Limitations The consumer sample was very diversified, but somewhat biased. The ideal sampling approach -- household-based random sampling -- would have been prohibitively expensive. The sample 's profile, especially in regard to the volunteers, reflects higher education, more skill in techniques for adapting to blindness, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly representative sample, according to comparison with the sparse national data available( McNeil, 1993). Therefore, as planned in the initial study design, the data analysis avoids projecting overall group numbers( such as the percentage who were employed), but rather focuses on comparisons between subgroups within the sample. That is, concern about the known bias affecting the percentage employed is minimized since the analysis controls on employments status. </P> In view of the nonrandom element in the sample, tests of statistical significance were not used ; such tests properly apply to samples drawn randomly. Instead, results are reported as meaningful differences only if they are large and are supported by consistent patterns. </P> Participants in the two-hour focus group discussions( audiotaped with their permission) were assured strict confidentiality, since the discussions might elicit criticisms of their own or their supervisors ' performance. The sessions seemed very frank, but self-constraint in discussing performance problems is a possible study limitation. </P> Another limitation dictated by funding constraints is the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many of the topics, but where it is relevant is noted in the discussion. </P> Conclusion Because the main practice implications of this research have been illustrated in tandem with presentation of the findings, only two tasks remain here. The first is a brief discussion of how the practice implications were derived, and the second is a summary of how the study has been subsequently disseminated and used. </P> DEVELOPING IMPLICATIONS AND STRATEGIES Two days of intensive discussion between the researchers and the bureau 's director were the main source of practice implications. The researchers had analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data( the surveys and the focus groups ' tapes) and had prepared draft reports for the director to study and share with his key staff in advance. In the discussions, the director expressed impressions of what the data implied for his agency ; the researchers commented on whether other parts of the data did or did not support those implications ; and when conclusions seemed clearly supported, they were retained for planning the strategies. Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knowledge of their own agency 's organizational constraints and potential resources, in addition to the study data. </P> Criteria for selecting strategies were that each strategy should be : 1) realistic with present or additional, but not exorbitant, resources ; 2) stated at a level and in enough detail for easy translation to action steps, but general enough to permit ingenuity by implementers and flexibility for application in other states ; 3) supported by related actions under one or more thematic headings ; and 4) challenging and innovative for the agency, but anchored in practices that had been demonstrated in at least one setting. </P> A project was funded to pilot portions of the new strategies, which were : 1) enhancing job-seeking skills during prevocational training, 2) training staff in job placement, 3) creating a statewide database of mentors, and 4) improving job development materials used with employers. A plan also was developed for structural and staffing changes to address findings that internal communications and staff responsibilities needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major economic and administrative changes in the state government. In this respect, the follow-up reinforced what had been expressed as a major concern in the focus groups. The focus groups had concluded that the bureau needed to be clearer and, especially, more consistent about its priority goals and then had to ensure that staff roles were defined and rewarded to support the priority goals. The problem was that periodic political changes of leadership shifted priorities or at least blurred them, so that concentration on employment outcomes was undermined. Not surprisingly, simply identifying that problem was not sufficient ammunition to prevent its recurrence. </P> DISSEMINATION AND IMPACT OF FINDINGS The study 's methods and findings have been widely disseminated to administrators, advocates, and researchers in the field of blindness and other VR services ; in presentations to the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind and the Society for Disability Studies ; and at regional and international meetings of the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired. The study 's final report continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been presented as supporting evidence for specific policy objectives nationally -- concerning use of computers by blind employees( Demographics update, 1995) ; and at the state level -- concerning support for " braille bills " by showing the strong linkage of braille usage and employment( Demographics update, 1996).( Braille bills are state laws that, in essence, require special education programs to offer training in braille for children who are blind or severely visually impaired, unless there are strong reasons not to do so ; details of actual or proposed braille bills vary). In fact, the study 's greatest utilization to date has been in response to such inquires at the policy level, with the potential to influence decisions about vocational rehabilitation practice even more broadly than contemplated within the one state that served as the research site. </P> Table 1 Socio-demographic characteristics of blind or visually impaired adults according to their work orientation( Illinois 1989).
