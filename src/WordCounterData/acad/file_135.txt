4019041 ABSTRACT <p> A six-year longitudinal study investigated the development of self-esteem in relation to mother 's child-rearing attitudes, role satisfaction, and perceived temperament of the child. Participants were two age cohorts of girls and boys from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study, being 6( n = 416) and 9 years old( n = 408) at the beginning of the study( baseline). Scores regarding mother 's hostile child-rearing attitudes, mother 's low role satisfaction, and maternal perceptions of child 's difficult temperament( high activity, negative emotionality, and low cooperativeness) were obtained at baseline and three years later. Self-esteem was measured by self-reports six years later, at the ages of 12 and 15. The results indicated considerable gender differences. Among girls nearly all childhood variables individually predicted self-esteem, whereas among boys the associations were less evident. Additionally, perceived difficult temperament at baseline predicted hostile child-rearing attitudes at first follow-up, which further predicted low self-esteem among girls only. <p> Self-esteem, conceptualized as evaluative judgments about self( e.g., Coopersmith, 1967 ; DuBois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996) or as overall feelings of worth or value as a person( e.g., Harter, 1998 ; Rosenberg, 1979), has been consistently found to be related to a wide area of adjustment and well-being, such as social relationships( Dekovic &; Meeus, 1997), school achievement( Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992), resilience to stressful life events( Dumont &; Provost, 1999), depression( Hammond &; Romney, 1995), suicidality( Wichstrom, 2000), substance abuse( Scheier, Botvin, Griffin, &; Diaz, 2000), personality disorders( Watson, 1998), and eating disorders( Willcox &; Sattler, 1996). Self-evaluations start to develop in early childhood( see Bowlby, 1982 ; Harter, 1998) and are relatively stable after adolescence( Block &; Robins, 1993 ; Kling, Hyde, Showers, &; Buswell, 1999 ; O'Malley &; Bachman, 1983). View of primary source of self-esteem varies according to theories and definitions of serf-esteem. William James( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that self-esteem develops through one 's feelings of competence( see Higgins, 1991 ; Gecas &; Shwalbe, 1983). The major determinant of one 's level of self-esteem in this context involves the relation between perceptions of competence and the importance of success. The sense of competence, in turn, reflects the discrepancy between one 's goal, or ideal, and one 's performance. The ideal self is a person 's representation of what she/ he wants to be or feels that she/he should be. During childhood the parents ' hopes and aspirations usually form the basis for ideal self-representations( Higgins, 1991 ; see also Harter, 1999). <p> Early symbolic interactionists such as Cooley( 1902) and Mead( 1934) have placed more emphasis on social interactions. The primary source of self-esteem has been suggested to be the opinions received from significant others. A similar view is shared by psychodynamic theorists( e.g., Kernberg, 1970) and attachment theorists( e.g., Bowlby, 1982), who highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs are satisfied and who experiences parents as totally accepting, emotionally available, and loving will view him/herself as absolutely good and loveable( see Bowlby, 1982). In short, parenting, especially in childhood, is of primary importance. <p> Empirical findings have supported the theoretical propositions. High self-esteem in children and/or adolescents is related to parental reports of warmth and acceptance( Coopersmith, 1967 ; Dekovic &; Meeus, 1997) and low levels of parent-child conflict( Shek, 1998). In addition, children 's and/or adolescents ' perceptions of authoritative parenting( Carlson, Uppal, &; Prosser, 2000), parental warmth( Paulson, Hill, &; Holmbeck, 1991), parental support( Paulson et al., 1991), and parental acceptance( Herz &; Gullone, 1999 ; Ohannessian, Lerner, Lerner, &; von Eye, 1998), as well as reports of strong affective ties with parents( Roberts &; Bengtson, 1996), are related to high serf-esteem. Low self-esteem has been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their parents as authoritarian( Buri, Louiselle, Misukanis, &; Mueller, 1988), as using psychological control and being overly firm( Litovsky &; Dusek, 1985), and as being overprotective( Herz &; Guillone, 1999), as well as reports of conflict with parents( Slater &; Haber, 1984). Moreover adolescents ' high self-esteem has been shown to be related to observations of positive mother-adolescent communication( Killeen &; Forehand, 1998). <p> Some, however, have suggested that parenting is affected by contextual factors such as child and parent characteristics( Belsky, Steinberg, &; Draper, 1991). Empirical studies have shown that different temperamental characteristics of the child elicit different parenting practices. For example, difficult temperament has been found to be associated with deficient parenting( Glark, Koshanska, &; Ready, 2000 ; Katainen, Rikknen, &; Keltikangas-Jarvinen, 1997 ; van den Boom &; Hoeksma, 1994). Empirical studies have also shown that parental role dissatisfaction is associated with less effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1999 ; Lerner &; Galambos, 1985 ; McLoyd, Jayaratne, Ceballo, &; Borquez, 1994). Moreover, it has been proposed that the relation between contextual factors and parenting may be reciprocal, and that contextual factors may also be associated with each other. Empirical results have shown that parental negativity( e.g., hostility and lack of empathy) increases difficult temperament in the child( e.g., Lerner &; Galambos, 1985 ; Rikknen &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992 ; cf. evocative genotype-environment interaction ; see Scarr &; McCartney, 1983), and that maternal role satisfaction is related to child 's difficult temperament( Katainen et al., 1999). However, there is a lack of research on the development of self-esteem that approaches parenting in a broader and transactional context( cf. DuBois &; Hirsch, 2000). <p> A few cross-sectional studies have indicated that these contextual factors( i.e., child 's temperament and parental role satisfaction) may be directly associated with the development of a child 's self-esteem. It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal, and rigidity( Windle et al., 1986), and low adaptability and reactivity to the environment, as well as high distractibility( Klein, 1992), are related to low self-esteem among children and/or adolescents. In addition, parents of adolescents with low self-esteem have been found to rate their marriages as less satisfying than have parents of adolescents with high self-esteem( Matteson, 1974). However, single mothers ' negative perceptions of the maternal role were not found to be related to their adolescent 's self-esteem( McLoyd et al., 1994). Thus, findings regarding the effects of child 's temperament and parental role satisfaction on the development of self-esteem remain sparse and somewhat inconsistent. <p> Taken together, studies on the development of self-esteem have neglected the known correlates of parenting such as the perceived temperament of the child and the role satisfaction of the mother. Moreover, a majority of the studies on the development of serf-esteem have been cross-sectional, and have not covered different developmental periods, particularly the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for studies that are both longitudinal and take the transactional nature of parenting and contextual factors( e.g., child 's temperament and maternal role satisfaction) into consideration( cf. DuBois &; Hirsch, 2000). <p> The objective of the present study was to examine the role of maternal child-rearing attitudes, role satisfaction, and perceived temperament of the child in the development of self-esteem from childhood to adolescence. We hypothesized that the mother 's emotional rejection of the child, her intolerance of the child 's behavior, and her strict disciplinary style( a constellation that closely resembles " hostile child-rearing attitude " ; Schaefer, 1959 ; see also Holden &; Edwards, 1989), as well as her low satisfaction as a mother, as a spouse, and with work when the child was young, would predict the child 's low self-esteem in adolescence. We also hypothesized that maternal perceptions of the child as being high in both activity and negative emotionality and low in cooperativeness -- perceptions that together refer to general child difficultness( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's low self-esteem in adolescence. Additionally, we hypothesized that maternal child-rearing, role satisfaction, and perceptions of child temperament transact in the development of self-esteem. <p> Finally, several studies have indicated that gender may play an important role in the development of self-esteem. First it has been shown that adolescent boys tend to have slightly higher self-esteem than do girls( Block &; Robins, 1993 ; Kling et al., 1999). Second, studies have found that there are qualitative differences in women 's and men 's self-esteem( Josephs, Markus, &; Tafarodi, 1992 ; Thorne &; Michalieu, 1996). That is, women 's self-esteem is more dependent on significant others, whereas men 's serf-esteem depends more on independent achievements. Also noteworthy is that sociocultural expectations are gender dependent( Block, 1983) and there are gender differences in the associations between temperament and family factors( e.g., Prior, 1992). Therefore, we acknowledge that the development of self-esteem might differ according to the gender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Finns( CRYF) is an ongoing prospecrive study of changes in behavioral and biological characteristics from childhood to adulthood. In 1980, the CRYF recruited a stratified random sample of 3,896 children and adolescents from six age cohorts on the basis of the population register of Finland. There were initial baseline clinical evaluations, with follow-ups every 3 years. Institutional review boards approved the project. Complete details of the CRYF study protocol can be found elsewhere( kerblom et al., 1991). <p> To meet the study objectives, focus was placed on participants in the 6- and 9-year-old cohorts, from whom maternal perceptions were available starting at childhood and from whom data on self-reported self-esteem were available at adolescence( ages 12 and 15). Of the 1,229 children participating in 1980, complete data( maternal evaluations at baseline and at three-year follow-up and self-reports of self-esteem at six-year follow-up) were available for 824 children( 6-year-old cohort : 223 girls and 193 boys ; 9-year-old cohort : 212 girls and 196 boys), thus comprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the study and children participating in the first or in the first and second stages of the study did not differ from one another in terms of activity, cooperativeness, or negative emotionality, or on measures of child-rearing practices or maternal role satisfaction( ps >.24). <p> Measures <p> Mother 's hostile child-rearing attitudes. Three scales from the Operation Family Study( Makkonen et al., 1981) were adopted to assess mother 's child-rearing attitudes. The first scale, comprising four items, tapped the child 's emotional significance( e.g., " The child is not emotionally significant to me " ; " I do not enjoy being with the child "). The second scale included three items focused on mother 's intolerance regarding the child( e.g., " The child makes me nervous " ; " The child is a burden to me "). The third scale consisted of two items focusing on the disciplinary style of the mother( e.g., " Disciplinary actions are needed regularly with the child "). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally disagree) to 5( totally agree), except for the disciplinary style items at baseline, with responses being 1( totally disagree) or 2( totally agree). This constellation resembles Schaefer 's( 1959) " hostile childrearing attitudes, " consisting of three elements : mother 's emotional rejection of the child, her feeling that the child is a burden, and her strict disciplinary style( see also Holden &; Edwards, 1989 ; Rikknen &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992). The stability of the individual child-rearing dimensions was evaluated, and the 3-year test-retest( Pearson 's r) was significant in all age and gender groups( rs >.21, ps <.01). In addition, the reliability estimates of internal consistency for the individual dimensions have been shown to range from.54 to.91( Katainen et al., 1997 ; Rikknen &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992). The 3-year stability for the hostile child-rearing attitudes construct was also significant( rs >.33, ps <.01). <p> Child temperament. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed by the mothers using scales derived from the Health Examination Survey( Wells, 1980). Activity was assessed using one item, with responses ranging from 4( always extremely active and energetic, even restless) to 1( always controlled). Cooperativeness was evaluated using one item, with responses ranging from 3( continuous problems in cooperating with peers) to I( always very cooperative and responsive to others). Negative emotionality of the child was evaluated using six items( e.g., " Other children 's parents often complain about the child 's behavior " ; " The child often hits, pushes or provokes other children "), with responses made on a 2-point scale( statement does not fit the child vs. the statement fits the child) at baseline and on a 5-point scale ranging from 1( totally disagree) to 5( totally agree) at first follow-up. The reliability of the negative emotionality dimension has previously been shown to be acceptable, ranging from.63 to.81( Katainen et al., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). This constellation of dimensions has been referred to as perceived child difficultness or perceived difficult temperament( see Goldsmith et al., 1987). The stability of the individual dimensions was evaluated, and the 3-year test-retest( Pearson 's r) was significant in all age and gender groups( rs >.23, ps <.01). The 3-year stability for the difficult temperament construct was higher( rs >.30, ps <.01). <p> Mother 's role satisfaction. Mother 's role satisfaction was assessed using scales derived from the Operation Family Study questionnaire( Makkonen et al., 1981). Items addressed the mother 's satisfaction with herself as a mother, as a spouse, and with her role at work( e.g., " I am satisfied with myself as a mother "), and these were evaluated on a scale ranging from 1( totally agree) to 5( totally disagree). The stability of the individual dimensions was evaluated, and the 3-year test-retest( Pearson 's r) was significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ps <.01). The 3-year stability for the role satisfaction construct was higher( rs >.43, ps <.01). <p> Self-esteem. A shortened version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory( Coopersmith, 1967 ; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1990, 1992) was used to assess self-esteem. The 18 items( e.g., " I often feel ashamed of myself " ; " I am pretty sure of myself " ; and " I am easy to like ") were evaluated on a scale ranging from I( totally disagree) to 5( totally agree). Reliability( Cronbach 's alpha) was above.79 for all age and gender groups. <p> Statistical Analysis <p> Confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling( Anderson &; Gerbing, 1988 ; Jreskog &; Srbom, 1996) were utilized. To examine the direct effects of child-rearing, role satisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament on self-esteem, structural modeling analyses were conducted using the LISREL 8.30 computer program( Jreskog &; Srbom, 1996). We used the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the models using chi-square statistics( chi/df < 2 ; Bollen, 1989 ; Loehlin, 1987), comparative fit index( CFI)( above.90), and root mean square error of approximation( RMSEA ; Steiger, 1990)( below.05 indicates close fit and from.05 to.08 adequate fit ; Browne &; Cudeck, 1993). RESULTS <p> Characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1. Mothers of 6-year-old boys perceived them as being less cooperative( baseline) and as having a higher degree of negative emotionality( 3-year follow-up), as well as tolerated their behavior less( baseline and 3-year follow-up) and used a more strict disciplinary style( 3-year follow-up), than mothers of 6-year-old girls. Similarly, mothers of 9-year-old boys perceived them as having a higher degree of negative emotionality( baseline and 3-year follow-up), as being less cooperative( 3-year follow-up), and as requiring more strict discipline( baseline and 3-year follow-up) than mothers of 9-year-old girls. <p> Measurement Models <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-rearing attitudes, role satisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament of child are shown in Table 2. Latent factors were allowed to correlate freely. To obtain adequate model fit for the 9-year-old boy cohort, error terms for disciplinary style and negative emotionality were allowed to correlate at the 3-year follow-up. After this specification, all factor loadings were significant in the expected direction for all age and gender groups, and chi/dfs < 1.73, CFIs >.90, and RMSEAs <.061 indicated good fit for the models. Further, the measured constructs exhibited statistically significant stability from baseline to follow-up 3 years later( s >.43, ps <.05 ; chi/dfs < 1.68, CFIs >.90, RMSEAs <.059). <p> The self-esteem construct was specified by setting the loading of the sum score of self-esteem variables at baseline and at follow-up to 1, with an error term of 0. <p> Structural Models <p> Direct effects. We tested whether the latent factors of mother 's hostile child-rearing attitudes, maternal role satisfaction, and perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-year follow-up predicted self-esteem in the adolescent at 6-year follow-up. Each latent factor was tested in a separate model. Mother 's hostile childrearing attitudes, low role satisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament of the child measured at baseline and at 3-year follow-up predicted low self-esteem at 6-year follow-up among girls( s >.17, ps <.05). There were two exceptions : perceived difficult temperament( 6-year-olds) measured at baseline and perceived difficult temperament( 9-year-olds) measured at 3-year follow-up did not predict self-esteem at 6-year follow-up. A good fit was indicated for all models( chi/dfs <1.96, CFIs >.90, RMSEAs <.067). For 6-year-old boys, mother 's hostile child-rearing attitudes measured at 3-year follow-up predicted low self-esteem at 6-year follow-up( = -.21, p <.05 ; chi/df = 0.16, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA =.000). There were no other significant associations for boys. <p> Transactional effects. To investigate the transactional effects of mother 's hostile child-rearing attitudes, role satisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all age and gender groups. The model involved( a) direct paths from baseline maternal perceptions to maternal perceptions measured at 3-year follow-up,( b) cross-relations between the constructs measured at baseline and at 3-year follow-up, and( c) path from all maternal perceptions measured at baseline and at 3-year follow-up to adolescent self-esteem measured at 6-year follow-up. <p> In regard to the girls, the a priori models did not show acceptable fits. Thus, we eliminated the nonsignificant paths( see Jreskog, 1993). The respecified models exhibited acceptable fits( chi/df = 1.50, CFI =.91, RMSEA =.047, and chi/df = 1.45, CFI =.93, RMSEA =.044, for the 6- and 9-year-old girl cohorts respectively). Figure 1 shows that paths from perceived difficult temperament measured at baseline to hostile child-rearing attitudes measured at 3-year follow-up to low self-esteem measured at 6-year follow-up were significant. <p> In regard to the boys, there were no significant transactional paths from the childhood characteristics to self-esteem in adolescence. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate whether an identical measurement model would fit for boys and for girls, we constrained all factor loadings and correlations between the latent factors to be equal between girls and boys, but allowed error variances at baseline and at 3-year follow-up to differ. The resulting goodness of fit was chi/df =1.77, CFI =.87, RMSEA =.061. However, based on the inspection of the modification indices( see Jreskog &; Srbom, 1996), we specified two error correlations between conceptually similar variables. After this specification, the same measurement model had a good fit : chi/df = 1.59, CFI =.90, RMSEA =.053. <p> Structural models. First, we tested whether the substantively similar final structural models of 6- and 9-year-old girls were statistically identical. We constrained all paths and factor loadings to be equal between the two groups, but allowed all error variances and the correlations between error variances at baseline and at 3-year follow-up to differ. The constrained model had an acceptable fit( chi/df = 1.48, CFI = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of girls. <p> Second, we tested whether the final structural model for girls would fit the boys ' data. When one correlation between error variances was allowed, the girls ' model fit the boys ' data( chi/df < 1.47, CFI >.92, RMSEA <.054). However, the path from hostile child-rearing attitudes to self-esteem, which among girls was significant, did not reach statistical significance( <.19, p >.05) among 6- or 9-year-old boys. <p> The present study investigated the development of self-esteem, that is, evaluative judgments about the self( Coopersmith, 1967), across six years, from childhood to adolescence, in a Finnish sample. The results are consistent with earlier empirical findings showing that parenting and parental perceptions are important( e.g., Cooley, 1902 ; Coopersmith, 1967 ; Dekovic &; Meeus, 1997 ; Matteson, 1974), but also highlight that parenting is not independent of contextual factors and that different elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hirsch, 2000). It was found here that maternal hostile childrearing attitudes, role dissatisfaction, and perceptions of the child as having a difficult temperament at ages 6 and 9 predicted low self-esteem as self-reported by the adolescents six years later at ages 12 and 15. Moreover, results showed that maternal perceptions of difficult temperament and hostile child-rearing attitudes transacted in the development of self-esteem. <p> Maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes( i.e., emotional rejection of the child, intolerance regarding the child 's behavior, and a strict disciplinary style) predicting low self-esteem over 3 and 6 years is in line with earlier cross-sectional results( e.g., Coopersmith, 1967 ; Dekovic &; Meeus, 1997), which have shown that parental reports of low emotional warmth and acceptance are related to a child 's low self-esteem. There were also complementary findings regarding parental role satisfaction and adolescent self-esteem. An earlier cross-sectional study( Matteson, 1974) showed that parental marital dissatisfaction is associated with adolescents ' low self-esteem, and current results add to the literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as a mother, as a spouse, and at work) before her child 's entry into adolescence is related to lower self-esteem in adolescence. In addition, maternal perceptions of child 's difficult temperament( i.e., high levels of activity and negative emotionality, and low cooperativeness) predicted low self-esteem. Cross-sectional studies have shown that self-rated dimensions closely related to temperamental difficultness -- negative mood, high withdrawal( Windle et al., 1986), and low adaptability( Klein, 1992) -- are associated with self-esteem among children and/or adolescents. Current results thus indicate that maternal reports of child temperament might also be a useful tool in detecting children who are at risk of developing low self-esteem. <p> Furthermore, maternal perceptions of difficult temperament may have promoted hostile child-rearing attitudes across 3 years, which in turn predicted low self-esteem across 6 years. This provides empirical evidence for the view that different factors transact in the development of serf-esteem( cf. DuBois &; Hirsch, 2000). Moreover, results support the view that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament) affect parenting( Belsky et al., 1991). Thus, parenting and parental perceptions of child temperament, owing to their interrelations( cf. Katainen et al., 1997 ; Katainen et al., 1998), ought to be studied simultaneously in regard to the development of self-esteem. <p> As hypothesized, gender proved to be an important qualifier. Quantitatively, more associations were found between maternal evaluations and adolescent self-esteem for girls than boys. Among girls, maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes, role dissatisfaction, and perceived temperamental difficultness of the child were all significant predictors of self-esteem in adolescence. Among boys, maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes predicted low self-esteem in adolescence, but only across three years and in the 6-year-old cohort. Qualitatively, the **25;717;TOOLONG transaction explained the development of self-esteem for girls only ; there were no transactions for boys. <p> The quantitative and qualitative gender differences may reflect differences in the developmental processes of self-esteem between boys and girls. According to theory( Gilligan, 1982) and empirical evidence( e.g., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996), the development of self-esteem in girls is more dependent on connectedness with and appraisal of other persons, whereas the development of self-esteem in boys is more dependent on individual achievement and separation from others. Therefore, mother 's child-rearing attitudes, role satisfaction, and perceptions of child temperament may be less essential for the development of self-esteem in boys than in girls. Further, utilization of maternal evaluations of childhood contextual and individual factors may explain the gender differences found in the present study : the same-sex parent has been suggested to be more important for the formation of self-esteem than the opposite-sex parent. The same-sex parent may, for example, have greater expectations for the child than the opposite sex-parent( cf. Ohannessian et al., 1998). However, there is also research suggesting that, for both girls and boys, the mother is more relevant for the development of self-esteem than is the father( e.g., Litovsky &; Dusek, 1985). <p> Finally, gender differences in the developmental process of self-esteem may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1983). High activity and low sociability are less accepted in girls than in boys( Block, 1983), and this may explain why temperamental difficultness predicted low self-esteem among girls only. This may also explain why perceived difficult temperament of the child was associated with maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes( cf. Katainen et al., 1997), which in turn predicted low serf-esteem among girls. <p> With regard to family factors, Harris( 1998) has suggested that parental behaviors have no effect on the psychological characteristics that children will have later. This may appear to be so because most previous studies have been cross-sectional or retrospective( Vandell, 2000). The present findings indicate that family factors do play an important role in the development of self-esteem, at least from childhood to adolescence. Additionally, self*esteem has been shown to be relatively stable after adolescence( e.g., Kling et al., 1999). It should also be kept in mind that different factors might play a role in the different developmental periods. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted. We used nonstandardized childhood measures to evaluate mother 's child-rearing attitudes, role dissatisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament of the child, a limitation that partly stems from the fact that baseline data were collected over two decades ago. However, the confirmatory factor analyses do provide evidence of the construct validity of the childhood measures( see also Rikknen, Katainen, &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 2000). In addition, the subjective maternal evaluation has been shown to be relatively stable and to predict personality, as well as psychological and physiological well*being, in earlier reports using the current dataset( Katainen et al., 1999 ; Pesonen, Rikknen, Keskivaara, &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 2003 ; Ravaja, Katainen, &; Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 2001 ; Rikknen et al., 2000), which strengthens the validity of the measures. <p> Furthermore, the fact that child temperament was based on mother 's evaluations has to be kept in mind when evaluating the results. Maternal evaluations may reflect subjective perceptions rather than the child 's actual behavior. However, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective as well as subjective components of a mother 's evaluations. Furthermore, Bates( 1983) has suggested that mother 's subjective perceptions as well as objective child temperament factors affect later developmental outcomes, and that such perceptions may be even more important to social development( cf. self-esteem development ; Cooley, 1902 ; Mead, 1934). Moreover, parental and observer ratings have been shown to correlate( Matheny, Wilson, &; Thoben, 1987). <p> Finally, some recent studies point to the multidimensionality of the self-esteem construct( e.g., DuBois &; Hirsch, 2000). However, self*esteem in the present study was treated as unidimensional, because the total score from the shortened version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory used here has previously been demonstrated to be more stable and valid than its individual dimensions in this Finnish dataset( Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992). Additionally, individual dimensions have been shown to overlap to a high degree in adolescence( Keltikangas-Jrvinen, 1992). <p> To summarize, this study provided evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's characteristics are important for understanding the development of adolescent self-esteem. Furthermore, in the development of self-esteem, these factors may transact. However, considerable gender differences were noted. <p> This research was financially supported by the Academy of Finland( Grant 50907SA), by the Vainio Foundation, and by the University of Helsinki( Grant 20550).
