4021741 The authors examine the effects of service barriers on the health status of older Chinese immigrants in Canada. A survey was completed in seven Canadian cities by a random sample of 2,214 older Chinese immigrants age 55 years or older. Service barriers related to administrative problems, personal attitudes, and circumstantial difficulties were significant predictors of physical and mental health when controlling for the demographic factors. Empirically, the findings confirm that service barriers are detrimental to the health of older immigrants. The service barriers in the areas of ethnic, language, or cultural differences between the service providers or services themselves and the older Chinese clients also suggest that factors related to communication contribute to these older clients ' perception of services or providers as culturally insensitive or unresponsive. Considering the individual, social, and economic costs incurred by adverse health consequences, barriers in service delivery must be addressed. </P> KEY WORDS : Chinese immigrants ; older people ; mental health ; physical health ; service barriers </P> There are abundant research findings on service barriers in older ethnocultural minority individuals. Although it is generally believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little research is available to examine this relationship. With the continuous increase in the immigrant population in Western countries, it is essential for practitioners and policymakers to understand the factors that facilitate better health and well-being of elderly immigrants, who are often considered one of the most vulnerable immigrant groups due to the multiple challenges they face as immigrants and older adults. In this study, we examined the relationships between service barriers and aging Chinese immigrants and their health status. </P> Recent research has provided evidence of the disparities in health and access to health services among ethnocultural minorities in Canada and the United States( Dunlop, Coyte, &; McIsaac, 2000 ; Groeneveld, Laufer, &; Garber, 2005 ; Moy, Dayton, &; Clancy, 2005 ; Williams, 2005). Research on social determinants of health has also indicated how systemic social and economic barriers are associated with health outcomes for visible minority groups( Willems, De Maesschalck, Deveugele, Derese, &; De Maeseneer, 2005), highlighting the importance of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning minority elders include language( Talamantes, Lawler, &; Espino, 1995), lack of transportation( Morgan &; Sampsel, 1994 ; Tsai &; Lopez, 1997), inadequate knowledge of services( Richardson, 1992 ; Tsai &; Lopez), and inadequate financial resources( Damron-Rodriguez, Wallace, &; Kington, 1994). </P> People of ethnic minority background in the Western countries face more service barriers than the general older adult population and report a lower level of use of services designed for aging adults than the general population( Woodruff, 1995). Institutional racism, mistrust of the system, inadequate knowledge of services available, lack of availability of culturally sensitive services, personal beliefs, family dynamics, and culturally dissimilar styles of interaction between service providers and users have also been reported( Biegel, Farkas, &; Song, 1997 ; Casado &; Leung, 2001 ; Damron-Rodriguez et al., 1994 ; Morgan &; Sampsel, 1994 ; Talamantes et al., 1995 ; Torsch &; Ma, 2000). Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and well-being of individuals( Zhan, Cloutterbuck, Keshian, &; Lombardi, 1998). However, most of the studies on service barriers have been descriptive and did not report the effects of service barriers on health outcomes. Therefore, our objective in this research is to examine the relationships between access barriers and the health status of the older immigrants. The key research question is " Do access barriers significantly affect the physical and mental health status of aging immigrants in a negative manner? " </P> Older Chinese immigrants in Canada were researched for several reasons. First, the older Chinese belong to the largest visible minority group in Canada. With a population of more than 1.1 million, this group accounts for 25.8 percent of all visible minorities( Statistics Canada, 2003). There is very little published research on service barriers experienced by this subpopulation, particularly the elderly members. Second, the experience of older Chinese immigrants in a Western country such as Canada may be particularly challenging because of their unique worldviews, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be perceived as " traditional. " Appreciating the implications of services barriers on their health and welt-being is useful for devising better strategies to meet their needs. Third, the findings are relevant to informing policymakers and practitioners of the challenges facing aging Chinese immigrants in other Western countries, for example, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, as many of their Chinese immigrants are from countries of origin that are similar to those of Canada 's, such as China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong( U.S. Census Bureau, 2006). The findings can facilitate policymakers and practitioners in these Western societies to better understand the effects of service access challenges on this culturally unique elderly group. </P> METHOD Research Design and Sampling A survey research design was used for this study, which was part of a larger study on the health and well-being of aging Chinese Canadians( Lai, Tsang, Chappell, Lai, &; Chau, 2003) age 55 years and older in seven Canadian cities -- Victoria and Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnipeg, Manitoba ; Montreal, and Toronto. The total Chinese population in these cities accounted for close to 89 percent of the Chinese population in Canada. To obtain the sample, telephone numbers listed with a Chinese surname in all of the research sites were identified to form the sampling frame. A total of 40,654 telephone numbers were randomly selected from the 297,064 numbers listed with a Chinese surname. Telephone screening was conducted by trained interviewers who called the selected telephone numbers to identify eligible participants who acknowledged themselves as an ethnic Chinese age 55 years or older. The eligible participants were then invited to a face-to-face interview either at the participant 's home or at one of the local community organizations collaborating with the research team. The " rolling-a-dice " method was used to select only one participant in households with more than one eligible participant. The interviews were conducted in either English or a Chinese dialect spoken by the participant. The method of using surnames as identification keys for locating Chinese and other Asian participants has been established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1994 ; Tjam, 2001). However, the limitations of this sampling method include excluding households that do not have a telephone or have an unlisted telephone number, individuals who use non-Chinese surnames, and mixed-ethnicity households in which the non-Chinese member 's name was used for registration of the telephone number. </P> Data collection took place between summer 2001 and spring 2002. A verbally administered, structured questionnaire was used. The questions were first constructed in Chinese, translated into English, and then translated back into Chinese to ensure that both versions were consistent in meaning. For standardized instruments, for which there was already a Chinese version, the Chinese version was used. The interview was conducted in the participant 's preferred language, which included English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Toishanese. Through telephone screening, 12,621 Chinese households were identified. Among them, 2,949 individuals who met the selection criteria were identified, and 2,272 participants in this group completed the questionnaire, resulting in an overall response rate of 77 percent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another country to Canada and 58 had been born in Canada. Because the Canadian-born group probably represents very different sociocultural background, characteristics, and access issues from the immigrant group, mixing the two groups may have resulted in an inaccurate picture of the findings. Also, owing to the enormous difference in sample size between the two groups, a comparison of these two groups was not feasible. Therefore, we chose to focus only on the 2,214 older Chinese immigrants, and the Canadian-born sample was excluded from the analysis. </P> Measures Health status refers to both physical and mental health and was measured by a Chinese version of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form( SF-36)( Ren, Amick, Zhou, &; Gandek, 1998). The SF-36 is a well-established and standardized health assessment instrument that has been applied to people from a range of cultural backgrounds( Ware &; Gandek, 1998 ; Ware et al., 1998). The questions cover physical and mental health. Using the normed scoring method suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from these questions were added to create two summary scores, the Physical Component Summary( PCS) and the Mental Component Summary( MCS), ranging between 0 and 100, with a higher score indicating a better health status. The scale has been adapted and translated into Chinese to fit a suitable cultural context. Previous psychometric evaluation has confirmed the reliability and validity of the instrument for use with the Chinese population( Ren et al.). Cronbach 's alphas of.90 and.84 were reported for the PCS and MCS, respectively, in this study. </P> Service barriers were measured by asking participants to answer either " yes " or " no " to a list of 21 barriers they might have faced while using health services. This list was developed from barriers identified in previous research( Tsai &; Lopez, 1997), as well as through consultation with service providers in the Chinese community. Examples of barriers include long waiting lists, professionals who do not understanding the users ' culture, transportation difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language. In a recent study( Lai &; Chau, 2007), these service barriers were found to have loaded significantly on to four factors : administrative problems in service delivery, cultural incompatibility, personal attitude, and circumstantial challenges. Administrative problems in service delivery( seven items) referred to problems such as the waiting lists being too long, the office hours being too inconvenient, and the procedures being too complicated. Cultural incompatibility( five items) included barriers such as professionals not speaking the users ' language, programs not being specialized for Chinese clients, and professionals not understanding the users ' culture. Personal attitudes( five items) included barriers such as feeling ashamed, uncomfortable with asking for help, and not believing that professionals can help. Circumstantial challenges( four items) were barriers related to the lack of transportation, weather unsuitable for traveling, and lack of knowledge about existing health services. The score for each of these domains represented the number of barriers that the participants experienced with respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these groups might be similar, it was difficult to assess the cumulative effects of having a single barrier or multiple barriers under the same category. Therefore, these four types of barriers were grouped into four binary variables, with 1 indicating a barrier in each of the noted areas and 0 indicating no barrier. </P> In this study, we assessed the effect of service barriers on health status by controlling the confounding effects of covariates including age, gender, marital status, education, social support, living arrangement, self-rated financial adequacy, personal monthly income, country of origin, and length of residence in Canada. Age referred to the participant 's chronological age at the time of the interview. Gender was grouped as male or female. Marital status was grouped as married or single. Education was divided into four groups ranging from no formal education to postsecondary education and beyond. Social support was originally measured using five questions adapted from the Older Americans Resources and Services Social Resource Scale( Pfeiffer, 1975) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability of a confidante, and availability of a helper should the need arise. Because the scoring range for each of the five items was different, the raw scores for each item were converted to standardized scores( Z scores). In the reliability analysis, removing one item from the scale increased the Cronbach 's alpha from.63 to a more acceptable level of.71. Therefore, only the sum of the standardized scores for the four items was used to form the final social support score, ranging between -5.91 and 5.80, with a higher score representing a higher level of social support. Living arrangement was grouped as either living alone or not living alone. Personal monthly income was grouped into four ranges from $0-$500 to $1,500 and higher. Self-rated financial adequacy was measured by asking the participants to indicate how well their income and investments satisfied their financial needs on a four-point scale including " very inadequate, " " not very well, " " adequately, " and " very well. " A higher score represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the country from which the participants emigrated. Length of residency referred to the number of years that the participants had resided in Canada. </P> Data Analysis Descriptive statistics including frequency distributions and means were used to examine the sociodemographic backgrounds and barriers reported by the respondents. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the effects of the different services barriers on physical health( PCS) and mental health( MCS) while controlling for the effects of demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, and living arrangement. To assess the contributions of service barriers to the variance in health status, the demographic variables and barrier variables were included as hierarchical variable blocks. For each regression analysis, using PCS and MCS as the dependent variable, respectively, the sociodemographic predictors were entered as the first block. Next, the four service barrier factors were entered as the second block to examine their effects while controlling for the sociodemographic variables. </P> RESULTS Among the 2,214 participants, 56. l percent( n = 1,241) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 55 to 101 years( M = 69.7, SD = 8.7). Close to 66 percent of the participants were married( n = 1,459). Almost 14 percent lived alone( n = 305). More than half( 58.3 percent, n = 1,291) of the participants reported a secondary education level or higher. All the participants identified themselves as an ethnic Chinese, yet they had emigrated from different countries and regions. The majority( 51.9 percent, n = 1,149) of the participants were from Hong Kong, followed by mainland China( 27.6 percent, n = 610). The remaining percentage of ethnic Chinese in the study were from Taiwan, Vietnam, Southeast Asia, Europe, the United States, Central America, and South America. On average, the participants had resided in Canada for 18.3 years( SD = 12). </P> Using the 21-item list of access barriers, the older Chinese immigrants reported an average of 4.8( SD = 4.9) types of access barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your language " was the most commonly reported barrier( 46.9 percent). " Waiting list is too long " ranked second( 38.4 percent). " Do not know about existing health services " ranked third( 34.3 percent). " Programs are not specialized for Chinese, " " professionals there do not understand your culture, " and " professionals there are not Chinese " ranked fourth to sixth, respectively, with a range of 31.2 percent to 30.6 percent of the participants indicating these items as barriers. Except for " waiting list is too long " and " lack of knowledge about existing services, " most of the top service barriers were related to language, culture, or ethnic differences between the immigrants and service providers or the services provided. On average, the participants reported 1.6 administrative barriers( SD = 2.1), 1.59 cultural barriers( SD = 1.9), 1.0 circumstantial barriers( SD = 1.2), and 0.5 attitude barriers( SD = 1.0). The proportion of participants who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52.1 percent ; problems related to personal attitude, 26.1 percent ; and circumstantial challenges, 52.3 percent. </P> We performed a hierarchical multiple regression analysis for physical and mental health, with demographic variables entered in the first block and the barrier variables entered in the second block( Table 2). When physical health was the dependent variable in the first round, gender, age, self-rated financial adequacy, and being an immigrant from another country were significant predictors. Adding the four service barrier variables did not change the original effect of these sociodemographic predictors. Among the four barrier variables entered, administrative problems, personal attitudes, and circumstantial challenges were the three that significantly predicted physical health when controlling for the confounding effects of the sociodemographic variables. </P> When mental health was treated as the dependent variable, higher social support, living with others, and better self-rated financial adequacy were the significant predictors. Adding the barrier variables did not change the predicting effects of these sociodemographic predictors. In addition, among the four barrier variables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstantial challenges were significant in predicting decreased mental health. </P> DISCUSSION Earlier studies on the service barriers facing ethnic minority older adults usually focused on the nature and characteristics of the barriers. It appears to be common knowledge that service barriers are related to poor health outcomes, yet little empirical research has demonstrated this association. This study adds a new understanding to how service barriers can affect health outcomes. Aging immigrants ' physical and mental health status is influenced by the dynamics of interaction at the structural level and by one-on-one experience with the system in seeking help and accessing services, further confirming the effects of social determinants on health reported by other researchers( Willems et al., 2005). This study adds empirical evidence to demonstrate the problematic reality encountered by aging visible minority adults in their attempts to access services in Canada, as well as the associated health consequences. </P> Although this study was conducted with older Chinese immigrants in Canada, the findings are relevant to older Chinese immigrants in the United States and other Western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced with similar access barriers and cultural challenges as are older Chinese immigrants in the United States( Casado &; Leung, 2001 ; Tsai &; Lopez, 1997). As the countries of origin of the Chinese immigrants in the United States are similar to those of Chinese immigrants in Canada, Chinese immigrants settling in both countries are likely to share similarities in sociocultural background and characteristics. Despite the differences in sociopolitical climate and various service delivery systems between Canada and the United States, we believe the negative effects of service barriers are similar. Our findings are useful as a reference point for social workers in the United States and other Western countries. However, additional research to examine how differences in service delivery systems between the two countries may have created different service barriers could be fruitful to better understand the interaction effects of system issues, service barriers, and health outcomes. </P> Aging Chinese immigrants reported difficulties accessing services because of communication barriers such as language incompatibility, lack of cultural competence on the part of service providers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other factors may elicit negative perceptions of service providers, the service system, and the quality of services as inadequate, disrespectful, and not useful. In effect, these factors could create an environment in which older Chinese immigrants feel unwelcome and are uncomfortable about approaching a care system that is difficult to access. For older Chinese immigrants, cultural beliefs about the importance of taking preventive measures to maintain good health may be unnecessarily compromised as a result of the system 's delays and lack of cultural sensitivity. Foregone care in these aging adults is costly to the health system and may yield additional social or economic costs. For instance, the subpopulation of aging Chinese with depression may be underserved because of a culturally incompatible and inaccessible service system and a personal culture that has socialized Chinese people to avoid seeking services for mental health problems. This avoidance permits the individual to save face and prevents bringing shame to oneself and one 's family( Choi &; Gonzalez, 2005). Discrimination on the basis of ethnicity and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging Chinese Canadians who attempt to access services. </P> The findings carry implications for gerontological social work practice. Considering the negative health consequences of service barriers, actions to remedy or reduce barriers are needed. The findings inform practitioners which types of service barrier should be targeted. Administrative problems, personal attitudes, and circumstantial challenges were the significant predictors of both physical and mental health. Although barriers related to cultural incompatibility were not significant in predicting either outcome variable, this does not mean that cultural difference and barriers are irrelevant. Barriers related to personal attitudes -- which include problems such as feeling ashamed of, discomfort with, or the embarrassment of asking for help and the mistrust that professionals are helpful -- often originate from the sociocultural norms and beliefs of this ethnocultural minority group. Also, older ethnic minority individuals ' negative experiences with the service system may reinforce these sociocultural norms and beliefs, thereby increasing further avoidance of the service delivery system among older ethnic minority individuals. It also means that the sociocultural context of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these barriers. </P> Barriers related to personal attitudes are often related to fears, stigma, and misconceptions about using formal services. To facilitate the development of a positive attitude toward using services, culturally appropriate psychosocial education programs should be provided by service providers to deal with those stereotypes regarding use of formal services. Community education, in languages understandable by older Chinese immigrants and using strategies that are culturally relevant to the target groups, is also useful in enhancing these potential users ' understanding of the nature of the services and the importance of seeking help. In addition, making appropriate transportation arrangements to facilitate access is an important strategy ; like many older immigrants from Asian countries, older Chinese immigrants often find the cold and snowy winter in Canada and the northern United States harsh and difficult to adapt to. </P> Owing to the differences between the health service delivery system in their countries of origin and that in Canada, it is not surprising that older Chinese immigrants report their tack of knowledge about existing health services as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reducing such barriers include education, development of outreach services, and establishment of better formal and informal communication networks between service providers and this target population. Practice in health care settings should also incorporate the culturally competent elements. For example, the culturally competent health care model recommended by Purnell and Paulanka( 2005) has pointed to the importance of practitioners ' strengthening their capacity in gaining culturally appropriate understanding of such aspects as communication, family roles and organization, high-risk health behaviors, pregnancy and child-bearing practices, spirituality, and health care practices. </P> Barriers related to administrative problems are significant in predicting health outcomes. For many older Chinese immigrants, the use of formal services is already an unfamiliar concept. Accessing and using services can be complicated and overwhelming. Service providers should consider developing a specific service coordinator position to review the existing administrative procedures and operational details related to service access to ensure that these administrative procedures are culturally appropriate, easy to understand, and usable by older Chinese immigrants as well as other ethnocultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing number of studies on racial inequalities and health disparities demonstrate that more effective and culturally sensitive communication in the health care system is needed to reduce health disparities for racial and ethnic minority patients( Kreps, 2006 ; Perloff, Bonder, Ray, Ray, &; Siminoff, 2006). Therefore, practitioners working with aging Chinese immigrants should enhance their health communication skills through ongoing training to develop their cross-cultural communication and counseling skills. The findings also support the importance of strengthening university social work curriculums so that social work graduates are well equipped with the cross-cultural communication skills required for working with culturally diverse aging immigrants. Given the increase of immigrants and ethnocultural minority populations in Canada and the United States, as well as in many other Western countries, social work training programs should consider making cross-cultural communication skills and use of language and cultural interpreters compulsory components of the social work curriculum. </P> The creation of " barrier-free " health and social care systems requires more than community education and training in cross-cultural communication skills. Enduring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care system require the development of equitable and culturally competent systems that respect the rights of culturally diverse populations. In other words, structural changes are needed to ensure that elderly immigrants as well as other ethnocultural minorities are being respected and treated in an equitable manner( Mullaly, 1997). As noted by Lundy( 2004), social work practitioners should understand the structural forces that influence the social conditions that result in individuals ' vulnerable situations. The focus of provision of material resources by social workers should be expanded to include creating change based on empowerment and enhancing clients ' critical consciousness. In the case of working with older immigrants, programs and services should be extended beyond providing tangible support services and materials. Practitioners should create services that facilitate these older immigrants to critically examine the current health care delivery system thoroughly and to empower them to have a voice in deciding how the service delivery system should be restructured so that their culturally diverse and unique needs can be met. </P> Although this study was conducted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without limitations. Although service barriers are statistically significant in the regression models, this statistical significance could be due to the large sample size. In reality, the effect sizes of service barriers in explaining physical and mental health were small. After controlling for the sociodemographic background variables, service barriers accounted for only about 2 percent of the variance in physical health and 5 percent of the variance in mental health. The full models also accounted for only about 8 percent of the variance in physical health and 10 percent of the variance in mental health. More research to determine the unknown explanatory factors is useful. On the other hand, although critics may argue the legitimacy of investing resources to reduce service barriers when only minimal effects on health status can be expected, facilitating equitable access to services is one of the key roles of the social work profession in the context of maintaining social justice and equity. This study further supports the efforts to address challenges and barriers faced by older immigrants, not only for reducing barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vulnerable aging population. </P> Original manuscript received March 23, 2006 </P> Final revision received August 30, 2006 </P> Accepted November 17, 2006 </P> Table 1 : Descriptive Statistics of the Study Variables( N = 2,214) PRE-FORMATTED Table 2 : Multiple Regression Analysis of Predictors for Health Variable -- Effect of Barriers( N = 2,214) PRE-FORMATTED
