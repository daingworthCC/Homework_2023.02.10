4012441 Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent( Fig. 1), painted by Francisco Goya( 1746-1828) in 1788, is one of the most astonishing works in an oeuvre replete with remarkable images. In the decade and a half since its inclusion in Robert Rosenblum 's survey of nineteenth-century art, this canvas has become widely known among scholars and their students. Rosenblum, following a line of interpretation that dates back to the middle of the nineteenth century, uses this painting to support a symptomatic reading of Goya 's art, which he describes as " the most sharply accurate mirror of the collapse of the great religious and monarchic traditions of the West. "( n1) Goya scholars also have tended to view the work as marking a significant turning point, albeit within a more circumscribed frame of reference, for it is in this picture that the fantastic makes its initial appearance in the artist 's work.( n2) Absent from both of these interpretive models is any suggestion of how the painting might have been understood at the time of its creation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little in the way of documentary evidence around which to construct a context. The one known document is an invoice dated October 16, 1788, in which the artist requests payment from the duke and duchess of Osuna for " two pictures that he has painted, representing passages in the life of Saint Francis Borgia for the new chapel that has been constructed at your expense in the Cathedral of Valencia. "( n3) The paintings were intended for the side walls of a chapel honoring the sixteenth-century saint, who had served as third father general of the Society of Jesus and was a famous ancestor of the duchess of Osuna. The Osunas were among the artist 's most important patrons over the next fifteen years, commissioning a wide range of works, beginning with a pair of portraits of the duke and duchess in 1785( G-W 219, 220).( n4) In 1787 Goya delivered a series of seven pictures depicting " rural themes " for their country house on the outskirts of Madrid( G-W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family portrait( G-W 278) and undertook the paintings depicting Saint Francis Borgia, after whom the Osuna heir had been named. In the late 1790s the Osunas commissioned a group of small-scale scenes of witchcraft for their country house( G-W 659-64), and they purchased four sets of the Caprichos in January 1799. Around that time, Goya again painted the duke 's portrait( G-W 674), and in 1805 he executed a stunning portrait of their daughter, the marchioness of Santa Cruz, dressed in Empire fashion( G-W 828). <p> Although nothing is known of the terms of the Borgia chapel commission, the works by Goya would have been intended to complement the main altarpiece, painted by one of his artistic rivals, Mariano Salvador Maella( 1739-1819).( n5) Dedicated on October 10, 1788, Maella 's canvas( in situ and in poor condition) portrays The Conversion of Francis Borgia, Duke of Gandia, an event that occurred when he saw the decayed corpse of the Empress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly realized the transitory nature of earthly pleasures. Goya 's picture for the left wall of the chapel, entitled Saint Francis Borgia Taking Leave of His Family( G-W 240), narrates the result of the religious awakening depicted in Maella 's altarpiece. The duke, having been widowed in middle age, bids farewell to his relatives as he departs to join the Jesuit order upon the maturity of his eldest son. The work is anecdotal and sentimental in character, with Francis and his heir embracing on the steps of the family palace at Gandia while other members of the family and household look on.( n6) The emotional reactions of the assembled figures, enacted through individualized physiognomies, lend the canvas an air of pathos, while the richly painted brocades and draperies bring to mind the rich surfaces of Giambattista Tiepolo, who had worked in Spain as first court painter to Carlos III from 1762 until the former 's death in 1770.( n7) <p> In contrast to this costume piece, Saint Francis Borgia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall, presents the viewer with a truly amazing mystical drama. The saint is dressed in a simple priest 's robe, his head encircled by a ring of divine light that echoes the form of the window behind him. Holding a crucifix in one hand, the other raised in a gesture of astonishment, he stares spellbound toward the figure laid out before him. The dying man 's agonies are inscribed unmistakably and with striking frankness in his naked body : the rigid limbs, heaving chest, sunken eyes, slightly open mouth, and grasping hand all suggest his suffering, and these torments are underscored by the agitated sheets that partially conceal his flesh. In addition to the two protagonists, four demonic creatures hover in a cluster behind the sinner, their infernal origin indicated by the flames surrounding them. Frank Heckes has pointed out that the subject depicted here is not an exorcism, as had been assumed previously, but rather a damnation that is narrated in vivid detail in an eighteenth-century account of the saint 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vida, virtudes, y milagros del grande S. Francisco de Borja. The text, which Goya 's painting closely matches, describes how the carved image of the crucified Christ held by Francis, having realized that the soul of a particular dying man could not be saved, <p>... detached its the Crucifix 's nailed fight arm, and placing its hand in that profusely bleeding lacerated wound in its chest, withdrew a fist filled with blood, and hurled it with indignation at the frowning, denigrated face, saying " Since you scorn this blood, which was shed for your glory, let it serve for your eternal unhappiness. " Then that pitiful man, with an awful, blasphemous shout directed against Jesus Christ, gave up his soul, convulsed by a horrid moan, and it was turned over to the infamous ministers of fire and fright.( n8) <p> Goya 's pictorialization of these " infamous ministers of fire and fright " emphasizes their fantastic character, and nothing in the artist 's work up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is hardly surprising, then, that these creatures have been the focus of most modern scholarship on the painting. Usually they are viewed teleologically, as the ancestors of the imaginary beings who populate much of the work that Goya would execute during the second half of the 1790s, including the witchcraft paintings for the Osuna country house( ca. 1797-98) and the print series the Caprichos, as well as the drawings leading up to it( 1797-99), and who would return periodically in the artist 's subsequent uncommissioned art.( n9) In addition to regarding the demons in the Valencia painting as antecedents for the supernatural strain in Goya 's later career, efforts have been made to locate visual precedents for them, with the art of Hieronymus Bosch, Spanish medieval images of the Last Judgment, and Henry Fuseli 's Nightmare frequently cited by scholars as possible sources of inspiration.( n10) Moreover, it is tempting to suggest that the Osunas ' taste for the supernatural in the 1790s dictated the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nigel Glendinning has pointed out, their taste was more conservative in the 1780s.( n11) <p> In this essay, I wish to propose another means of approaching Goya 's painting, one that views it not as a harbinger of things to come, as based on specific artistic precedents, or as circumscribed by the conditions of patronage, but rather as deeply embedded in aesthetic developments taking place in Spain around the time of its creation. As a point of departure, I will examine the analysis of the picture offered by Pedro de Silva in the oration he wrote for the 1795 prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy of S. Carlos in Valencia.( n12) Silva 's text is one of the few substantial contemporary commentaries on Goya 's art that has come down to us, and his reading of the image differs fundamentally from that proposed in recent scholarship. Rather than focusing on the demons, he centers his discussion on the dying man, as indicated in the title he uses to refer to the painting : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Seo). Only at the end of his analysis -- and in a single sentence -- does he mention the " zealous " attitude of the saint, and the " other figures los demas personajes " who react to the events before them with " admiration, surprise, and terror "( 30). Modern scholars have taken Silva 's ambiguous reading of the ontology of these monsters( that is, as " personajes ") to indicate that he did not understand their demonic nature. As a result, when his text is mentioned at all it is relegated to the footnotes and used to suggest that Goya 's contemporaries often failed to grasp the meaning of his art.( n13) <p> I intend to argue that the significance of Silva 's analysis lies not in its validity as a " correct " or definitive interpretation, but rather in the conceptual tools that he brings to bear on the image. Written by a member of the artistic establishment during an important juncture in the development of aesthetic thought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " los inteligentes " would have had for such a painting, in terms of both the techniques employed by the artist to create it and the methods by which the viewer was imagined to decode its meaning.( n14) In particular, two related issues that Silva addresses in examining the work -- the expressive character of the human figure and the nature of artistic imitation -- were widely discussed in the orations delivered at the prize-giving ceremonies of the royal academies in Madrid and Valencia, as well as in aesthetic treatises written during the final two decades of the eighteenth century. Silva 's attention to the semiotics of the body in Goya 's painting will provide a lens through which to consider important changes that took place in progressive aesthetic thought in Spain in the final years of the century. These developments, in which Silva played an important role, revolve around a shift from the classicizing idealism advocated by Anton Raphael Mengs and his Spanish followers toward a more naturalistic approach to the making of art. <p> Expression and imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a late twentieth-century art historian -- can bring to bear on this painting. Rather, these issues will be seen to have informed Goya 's practice as an artist during the 1780s and 1790s. His involvement in the affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando in Madrid, which he served as assistant director of painting from 1785 until 1795 and then as director of painting until 1797, suggest that he would have been familiar with the aesthetic developments and debates taking place within that institution.( n15) Careful examination of the religious paintings and tapestry cartoons that Goya executed during this period will reveal a conscious and evolving engagement with the semantic potential of the human figure that reflects ideas being articulated by the advisers to the academies in Madrid and Valencia. Moreover, by examining Goya 's output of these years in terms of expression and imitation, I hope to indicate that his religious works and tapestry cartoons, two aspects of his production that have been treated separately in the literature, are animated by a common set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the figure should be considered in relation to recent analyses of the representation of the body in French painting of the same period. In particular, the art of Jacques-Louis David and his pupils has been the subject of several important studies that have centered on the depiction of the human figure.( n16) Although the artistic( not to mention the political) circumstances are quite different in late eighteenth-century Spain, it is revealing to examine Goya 's painting as an important episode in the rethinking of Neoclassical attitudes toward human form that takes place in a variety of contexts at the end of the eighteenth century. Pedro de Silva and His Analysis of Goya 's Painting <p> As a son of the marquis of S. Cruz, Pedro de Silva( 1742-1808) enjoyed an important career at the Bourbon court in Madrid. His activities included a keen and prolonged involvement in the affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando, to which King Carlos III named him an honorary member( academico de honor) in 1766 and an adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claude Bedat as one of the few advisers with any aesthetic sense, he was part of a reforming faction that centered around Antonio Ponz, secretary of the academy from 1776 until 1790, and also included Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, among others.( n17) Silva was primarily interested in architecture, having been accepted by the academy as an artist member( academico de merito) in that art form in 1768. In 1772 he delivered the oration at the triennial prize-giving ceremony, in which he addressed the topic of artistic imitation, focusing on the role of imitation in architecture.( n18) But beyond this particular interest, Silva was involved in every major decision made during these crucial decades, and he played an important role in the debates on educational reform that occupied much of the collective energy of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando from 1792 until 1798.( n19) Like many important figures in this academy, Silva was named an honorary member of the Royal Academy of S. Carlos in Valencia, which was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearly subordinate role to its parent institution in Madrid.( n20) Silva was asked to write the oration for the 1795 prize-giving ceremony in Valencia, and it is within this context that his remarks on Goya 's painting occur. <p> As in his oration of 1772 in Madrid, Silva chose to speak on the imitation of nature.( n21) After some general remarks describing imitation as always having been the object of the arts and insisting on truth as the artist 's only guide, Silva turns to Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent. He begins by picturing a viewer standing before it, a scenario that might seem surprising at first, given the audience of art students that his address was intended to instruct. Moreover, unlike the students, members, and advisers of the academy, the spectator that Silva delineates is not versed in the practice, theory, and history of art. Instead, he describes a simple mother who brings her disobedient son to look at Goya 's picture " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The focus of their attention is the dying sinner, whose body and facial expression reveal " a soul violently agitated by the cruel regrets of its crimes, and of the hopeless conviction of its approaching eternal damnation "( 28). Turning his attention to the artist for a moment, Silva employs the overblown rhetoric typical of these orations to suggest that the careful study of nature has permitted Goya to create a convincing depiction of the sinner 's afflictions : <p> You, beautiful nature, you, so varied in your productions, you taught the observant artist the violent convulsions that the desperation of the soul causes in the muscles of the body ; you recited to him the effects that the violent contraction of the muscles necessarily produces in the instantaneous deformation of all of the features ; you demonstrated to him that in this state the circulation of the fluids is suspended, and precisely how the color of the flesh changes....( 29). <p> The artist 's naturalistic depiction of the sinner 's body, Silva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive faculties of those who view it. " Even if the spectator might be the most ignorant and common person as the mother clearly is intended to be a chain of thoughts occurs that persuades him convincingly of the extreme degree of desperation and fury that have come to this unhappy man "( 30). This involuntary mental process entails unconsciously comparing Goya 's representation of the dying man 's features and body to an archive of images of people agitated by violent passions, which the woman 's sense of sight has stored in her mind. Since the characteristics that she discovers in this figure are " stronger and more evident, livelier and more vehement "( 29) than any she has witnessed previously in nature, she concludes that the passion animating his body must be more violent than any she has ever encountered. The other figures, whom she notices only secondarily, according to Silva, serve to reinforce the interpretation that the representation of the sinner 's body has led her to make. Thus, the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist 's exacting imitation of nature, through which he communicates to the beholder the physical and psychological agony of the scene. It is in this way that Goya 's painting provides an example for the students of the academy to follow. The Concept of Expression in Eighteenth-Century Spain <p> In his imagined scenario, Silva articulates a central tenet of Western aesthetic thought : the belief in the expressive character of the human body. This semiotic model presents the body as a visual text to be decoded by the viewer, with external physical signifiers such as pose, gesture, and facial expression encoding the passions, emotions, and inclinations that animate the figure. From this premise, it follows that the skillful practitioner of the art of painting or sculpture " does not simply portray the material aspect of the body ; he also manages to describe and express for us the invisible characteristics of the soul "( 28). Silva had advocated the same notion in his 1772 oration, in which he states, " The appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make known the passion possessed by the figure being represented "( 56). <p> These principles regarding expression had been established during the Italian Renaissance by Leon Battista Alberti( 1404-1472) and Leonardo da Vinci( 1452-1519), and their writings were widely available in Spain at the end of the eighteenth century, thanks to translations by Diego Antonio Rejon de Silva that were published in a single volume in 1784. In book 2 of On Painting( 1435), Alberti outlines the requirements for a successful composition and states, " In order that those looking at the picture will be most attentive, it is necessary that the inanimate figures it contains appear as if they are alive by expressing the passions of their souls.... These movements of the soul are made known by those of the body.... "( n22) For his part, Leonardo insists that painted figures should be represented " so that on viewing them one knows immediately what they are thinking or what they wish to say, " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guidance.( n23) But in contrast to Alberti 's emphasis on decorum and selective imitation, Leonardo advocates a greater liveliness of expression, famously remarking that without the variety provided by the accidents of nature the depicted figures will appear " twice dead. "( n24) In addition to translating the texts of these Renaissance authors, Rejon de Silva advocated their ideas in his own writings of the 1780s. In 1786, for example, he published a lengthy poem, entitled La pintura, that put Neoclassical principles into verse. In it he refers to the human face as the " involuntary index / Of the heart, and no less constant " and mentions Alberti and Raphael among his sources.( n25) These were ideas that Rejon would have advocated to his colleagues in the Madrid academy, to which he was named an honorary member in 1780 and an adviser in 1787. <p> Another important formulation of the concept of expression was the method codified in the seventeenth century by the French painter, theorist, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) His system for representing the passions, outlined in an illustrated lecture to the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1668, was first published in 1698 as Conference de M. Le Brun sur l'expression generale et particuliere. The juxtaposition in this volume( and countless others based on it) of highly legible line drawings of the face with brief descriptions of the effects of various mental states on the human features proved to be an easily adaptable method that quickly became one of the cornerstones of academic doctrine throughout Europe. Le Brun 's text provided a means of depicting expression that is based not on an artist 's direct observation( as had been encouraged by Alberti and Leonardo), but rather on his adherence to an established set of pictorial signs that often were followed prescriptively. Moreover, Le Brun privileges the face over the rest of the figure and views the effects of the passions as universal, giving no account of how their somatic manifestation might be conditioned by age, nationality, climate, or other particularizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct impact of Le Brun 's ideas in Spain, engravings after his Battles of Alexander, which are a veritable catalogue of the expressive possibilities of the human features, were owned by the Royal Academy of S. Fernando.( n27) Moreover, a book entitled Ensayo sobre el origen y naturaleza de las pasiones, del gesto y de la accion teatral indicates that his approach to representing the passions was not unknown during the final decades of the eighteenth century.( n28) The author of this volume, Fermin Eduardo Zeglirscosac, notes that he has relied on Le Brun 's Conference,( n29) and the illustrations drawn by Francisco de Paula Marti Mora appear to derive from editions of Le Brun 's treatise. Although this text was published more than a decade after Goya 's paintings for the Borgia chapel, the similarity between the dying man 's features in the deathbed scene and the plate depicting " physical pain "( Fig. 2, above right) -- particularly the open mouth and the flaring nostrils -- suggest Goya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind Goya 's image, as it advises that in a figure who is experiencing physical suffering, an " affection of restlessness and activity will manifest itself by the tension of the muscles.... "( n30) <p> A treatise with a much more direct impact on Spanish artists and theorists throughout the eighteenth century was El museo pictorico y escala optica( 1715-24) by the artist and theorist Antonio Palomino( 1655-1726).( n31) The index of terms at the end of the first volume of Palomino 's three-volume text offers a concise definition of " expresion " as the " action of expressing the passions and inclinations in a figure or narrative that is being painted. "( n32) The second volume, entitled Practica de la pintura, includes a chapter dedicated to physiognomy that begins by establishing the indexical character of the body : " It is a steadfast principle of natural philosophy that the constitution of the human body, and the representation of the face, are infallible indices of the passions and inclinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brun 's emphasis on facial features, Palomino asserts that although the countenance plays the principal role in revealing internal mental states, the other parts of the figure also have a share, since their configuration depends on " the interior passions and propensities of the mind. "( n34) He goes on to discuss the body as a signifier of both habitual and momentary attitudes, and furnishes descriptions of many of them( although no illustrations), alluding to Leonardo 's Treatise on Painting in the process.( n35) <p> Goya includes Palomino 's Practica de la pintura in his 1783 portrait of the count of Floridablanca( G-W 203), indicating its status as an emblem of academic thought during the second half of the eighteenth century. This treatise, its title visible on the spine of the binding, serves as an attribute of the sitter 's role as protector of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando. Leaning against the table are plans for the Imperial de Aragon, which, together with Palomino 's text, inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical principles of art and their application to solving practical concerns, a pragmatic approach typical of the Spanish Enlightenment.( n36) This duality is made flesh by the juxtaposition of Goya 's self-image, presenting a picture for the count 's inspection, with an unidentified engineer standing in the background. <p> By far the most influential source for late eighteenth-century Spanish ideas on the semiotics of the figure were the paintings and writings of the German Neoclassical artist Anton Raphael Mengs( 1728-1779). Shortly after completing his famous ceiling in the Villa Albani in Rome, Mengs was called to Madrid in the summer of 1761 to serve as first court painter to Carlos III, a post that he held until his death in 1779.( n37) Mengs devoted most of his attention to the decoration of the Royal Palace in Madrid, but he also executed portraits and religious images. Although he only played a major role in the daily affairs of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando for a couple of years in the mid-1760s, Mengs cast a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain, particularly in the years following his death in 1779. A Spanish edition of his writings, translated by his friend Jose Nicolas de Azara, was published in 1780.( n38) In the Royal Academy of S. Fernando prize-giving oration of 1781 -- the first following Mengs 's death -- Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos describes his writings as " the catechism of good taste and the code of professors and lovers of the arts, " and he alludes to " the shadow of Mengs, of the son of Apollo and Minerva, of the philosopher painter, of the master, of the benefactor and the legislator of the arts. "( n39) Bedat suggests that the impact of Mengs reached its apogee in 1784 and that his Neoplatonic outlook had a profound impact on the advisers to the academy, who mention him frequently in their orations.( n40) But Mengs 's influence was not purely theoretical, as the professors of the academy were deeply affected by the example of his practice as an artist. Mariano Maella, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Goya 's brother-in-law Francisco Bayeu( 1734-1795) were among the German artist 's closest followers.( n41) <p> A summary of Mengs 's aesthetic thought appeared in 1776 in the form of a lengthy letter written to Antonio Ponz, who became secretary of the Royal Academy of San Fernando that same year. Ponz included the letter in volume four of his Viaje de Espana( 1772-94), a monumentally important eighteen-volume undertaking in which he sought to catalogue and describe the cultural riches of Spain. Before discussing the paintings and frescoes in the Royal Palace in Madrid( the topic of his letter), Mengs outlines a hierarchy of artistic styles that progresses from the ideal to the real. After describing the " sublime style, " the " beautiful style, " and the " graceful style, " he comes to the " significant or expressive style. " Mengs indicates his opinion of this mode by summarizing antique attitudes toward it : " The ancient Greeks favored the beautiful over the expressive, preferring not to disfigure forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n42) Thus, in focusing too much on the representation of the passions an artist runs the risk of introducing accidental elements into the composition that are at odds with the creation of ideal beauty, which Mengs had come to value in Rome under the influence of his friend, theorist and antiquarian Johann Joachim Winckelmann( 1717-1768). <p> Nevertheless, Mengs considered expression to be a fundamental aspect of the art of painting, and he held a deep admiration for the depiction of the passions in the art of Raphael, which he saw as paradigmatic of the expressive style. However, in praising Raphael, he criticizes other modern artists -- for whom we might imagine Le Brun and adherents to his method -- for the affectation that often enters into expression in their works. In discussing Raphael 's style of drawing, Mengs writes : <p> That which, above all else, causes amazement... is that the character of the painted figures corresponds in such a way to the actions in which they are represented that one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather by natural inclination, is engaged in the activity depicted by Raphael, and this is apparent not only in the physiognomy, which makes known the state of mind of men, but also in the complete form of his body and its parts.( n43) <p> His esteem for the Italian artist is manifested in a series of drawings after the heads found in the School of Athens, which were engraved during the mid-1780s by the Italian printmaker Domenico Cunego and published in a folio entitled Cabezas de personages de la escuela de Atenas de Rafael.( n44) <p> Through Mengs, Raphael exercised an important influence on Spanish thought and practice regarding expression. In La pintura( 1786), Rejon de Silva voices admiration for Raphael 's portrayal of the passions and singles out The Fall on the Road to Calvary, then hanging in the Royal Palace in Madrid, for special praise.( n45) Moreover, the library of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando owned several volumes of reproductive prints after Raphael 's work, including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael appears to have been the best-represented artist in the reproductive print holdings.( n46) Into the 1790s artists in the Madrid academy continued to view Raphael 's art as the paradigm of expression. For example, during the debates of 1792 on reforming the academy 's educational program, the painter Luis Paret y Alcazar and Manuel Salvador Carmona, the director of engraving and Mengs 's son-in-law, both recommended in their reports that students be required to study the heads in the paintings of Raphael.( n47) Expression in Goya 's Art, 1780-99 <p> Goya 's religious paintings of the 1780s, leading up to the Valencia commission, indicate his profound interest in the expressive potential of the human figure. The Christ on the Cross( Fig. 3) of 1780 adheres closely to the Mengsian paradigm of idealizing expression. In fact, the disposition of the figure is closely related to a representation of the same subject by Mengs( Fig. 4), which hung in the bedroom of Carlos III in the Royal Palace at Aranjuez.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an upturned gaze that makes him accessible to the viewer and could plausibly be derived from handbooks on representing the passions. In each case the body is presented in a graceful contrapposto pose and with little evidence of physical suffering aside from a few discreet drops of blood around the crown of thorns, the nails in the feet, and on the cloth. This minimizing of the physical aspects of the Crucifixion is quite different from the concealed face and emphasis on the body in the Christ on the Cross by Diego Velazquez( Fig. 5), after whose works in the Spanish royal collection Goya had executed a series of prints in 1778.( n49) Velazquez 's painting foregrounds the somatic nature of the subject, featuring a visible wound, blood-streaked hands and feet, and a sharp lighting that emphasizes Christ 's corporeality. <p> In Mengs 's letter of 1776 on the royal collection, Velazquez exemplifies the " naturalistic style, " which is discussed after the " expressive style " and just before Mengs turns to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand, is informed by the principle of imitating selectively from nature, a classically inspired concept that Mengs emphasized in his writings, which were published in Spain the year that Goya executed this painting : "... if a picture contains the most beautiful parts of nature, and each one shows the truth within it, it will be a work of good taste.... "( n50) The artist 's goal is to create a figure of ideal beauty that surpasses nature by virtue of the perfection of its forms. Significantly, this painting served as Goya 's reception piece for entry into the Royal Academy of S. Fernando. In aligning himself with Mengs rather than Velazquez, Goya was attempting to gain admission into the academy by appealing to the current tastes of its members and advisers. His intention would have been to demonstrate his ability to paint religious subjects in the favored, idealizing manner at a time when he would have been known primarily as a painter of lower-class genre scenes of peasants and majos, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being called to Madrid by Mengs in the winter of 1774.( n51) <p> In the wake of this demonstration piece, Goya 's religious paintings of the next several years reveal a more varied and pragmatic treatment of the human form as a carrier of meaning. In these works the artist is careful to take into account the specific demands of the subject, the commission, and the context in which the painting was to be seen. Nevertheless, Goya continues to operate, to varying degrees, within the framework for depicting the figure set forth by Mengs. The canvas portraying Saint Bernardine of Siena Preaching before Alfonso V of Aragon( Fig. 6) is noteworthy for its varied treatment of face and gesture. Commissioned in 1781 for the church of S. Francisco el Grande in Madrid but not unveiled until 1784, this work portrays the Franciscan saint addressing a deeply attentive audience. The wide range in age, physiognomy, and gesture conveys an individuality of response among the listeners. Goya includes his own likeness at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mengs 's self-portrait at the left of his Adoration of the Shepherds( Fig. 7), commissioned by Carlos III in 1770 and hanging in the Royal Palace in Madrid.( n52) Although at the opposite end of the social hierarchy from Goya 's courtiers, the shepherds in Mengs 's painting also exhibit disparate reactions to the miracle before them, and they display the same combination of humility and nobility that characterizes the noblemen and their attendants in Goya 's painting. <p> Closer examination reveals that aside from the similar emphasis on expression, the two works exhibit important differences, in Mengs 's painting, the garments worn by the shepherds and Joseph suggest that these figures are intended to evoke classical statuary, while the Virgin is reminiscent of figures found in the art. of Raphael, and Mengs himself acts as the intercessor found in many Renaissance paintings. Goya, by contrast, infuses his image with a greater degree of naturalism, treating a religious subject as if it were a history painting. The elegant and colorful costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specificity of the image and to create an air of historical accuracy, although, in fact, they date from several centuries after the event depicted.( n53) The sense of naturalism is intensified by the circumscription of supernatural allusions to the shaft of divine light and the star above the saint 's head, in contrast to the angels who occupy the upper third of Mengs 's image. The earthbound tenor of Goya 's picture is even more striking in the context of the works painted for the same church by his rivals, including Maella and Francisco Bayeu.( n54) The profusion of clouds and angels in their productions are probably a direct response to similar elements in the unfinished Annunication by Mengs that Carlos III ordered to be installed in the council room of the Madrid Academy in 1780 as an example to the professors and their students.( n55) <p> Following his modest success with the canvas for S. Francisco el Grande, Goya obtained a number of important religious commissions. Perhaps most significant among these was the royal commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side altars of the convent of S. Ana in Valladolid.( n56) For this project, Goya utilized a more strictly classicizing artistic mode that has none of the specificity of detail found in the depiction of Saint Bernardine. Among the S. Ana paintings, The Death of Saint Joseph( Fig. 8) is crucial for our understanding of the development of the Valencia deathbed scene, perhaps begun in the same year. Its precisely structured composition portrays Christ and Mary making restrained gestures of grief at the instant of Joseph 's death, which his gracefully clasped hands and heavy eyelids indicate to be a moment of peaceful surrender to his fate. The carefully painted, heavily draped figures have a generalized quality reflective of the principle of selective imitation, which was championed in the oration delivered at the prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando held on July 14, 1787, a couple of months before the dedication of the convent. In that address, the duke of Almodovar invoked the " immortal Mengs " in stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect imitation of the most carefully chosen nature.... "( n57) <p> Compositionally, however, The Death of Saint Joseph has a pared-down, geometric quality that is more austere than Mengs 's approach. Mary 's tilted pose and the broad swath of divine light( an expansion of that which falls on Saint Bernardine) create intersecting diagonals that are balanced by the right angle formed by Christ and Joseph. The result is an emphasis on order and decorum, in both execution and mood, that echoes the classically inspired austerity of the building, which had been designed by court architect Francisco Sabatini.( n58) In a letter to Martin Zapater, Goya captures the tenor of the painting by alluding to the " architectonic style estilo arquitecttnico, " which he notes is in fashion at the moment.( n59) <p> Although The Appearance of Saint Francis by Michel-Ange Houasse( 1722) has been proposed as a source for the composition of Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent,( n60) a preliminary drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death of Saint Joseph as a point of departure for the Valencia painting. The basic compositional structure of the drawing appears to derive from the relation between Christ and Joseph ; however, the upper body and head of the dying man are turned slightly toward the viewer. These subtle changes have significant ramifications for the observer 's relation to the image, as they break down the " fourth wall " and force the viewer into dialogue with the depicted figure. An even more direct engagement with the viewer had been present in an oil study for The Death of St. Joseph( Fig. 10), in which a foreshortened deathbed projects into the observer 's space and the anguished expression of the saint becomes the composition 's focal point. The emotionalism in the oil sketch for S. Ana is heightened by the emphasis on the relationship between father and son, enacted through their reciprocal gazes and Christ 's embracing gesture. Another important similarity between this sketch and the preliminary drawing for the Valencia Cathedral work is the presence of supernatural figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final version of The Death of Saint Joseph. In the drawing of Saint Francis Borgia and the dying man, several loosely outlined beings occupy the upper half of the image ; the one on the right, who seems to have horns, might represent a fleeing demon who has been exorcized. In spite of these common elements, the crucial difference between these two images is the exposure of the dying man 's body in the sketch for the Borgia painting. <p> By the time Goya made an oil sketch for the Osuna commission( Fig. 11), the subject had changed from exorcism( or possibly extreme unction) to damnation, with the demonic identity of the creatures now made plain by their monstrous forms( not fully visible in the illustration). Moreover, the appeal to the viewer has been significantly increased by replacing the profile view of the saint in the preliminary drawing with a frontal pose and theatrical gestures that are mirrored in his wide-eyed, frowning expression.( n61) In addition, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an intensified sense of suffering in his features, particularly apparent in the sunken eyes and open mouth. Taken as a whole, the order and generalization of the drawing have given way to a sense of frenzied antagonism and a specificity of forms, as the dying man 's restless agony contrasts dramatically with Saint Francis 's pious zeal. The distinct vertical line created by the edge of the curtain marks this opposition by firmly dividing the composition in two. At the same time, however, the exposed right foot of the condemned man just touches the saint 's robe, establishing a sense of interrelation between them. <p> The final painting includes alterations to the composition of the oil sketch designed to lend the work a more harmonious feeling. Goya reduced the number of demons and clarified their forms, softened the folds of the curtain, and introduced a greater degree of idealization into the figure of Saint Francis.( n62) The saint 's more balanced pose echoes that of Saint Bernardine in the painting for S. Francisco el @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand. But the unflinching naturalism of the sinner 's body, which so interests Pedro de Silva in his address to the Valencia academy, remains intact. In fact, it is deepened by exposure of more of his midsection and the introduction of the clenching gesture of his hand. Within the context of Goya 's religious paintings of the 1780s, the emotional extremes of the two principal figures in this work signify his ultimate rejection of the idealizing concept of expression advocated by Mengs and his Spanish followers. Indeed, the sharp contrast in expression around which Goya 's image is structured creates just the sort of affectation to which Mengs had objected in his letter on the paintings in the Royal Palace in Madrid. Moreover, the emphasis on face and gesture in Goya 's previous religious works has been replaced by a concept of expression that encompasses the entire figure.( n63) <p> Although this lack of idealization is unique in the artist 's sacred works up to this point, parallels for the naturalism of the condemned man occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later 1780s for the Royal Tapestry Factory. One such example is the cartoon depicting Summer, or The Harvest( Fig. 12), commissioned in 1786 as part of a series of the four seasons for the dining room of the prince and princess of Asturias in the Pardo Palace.( n64) This canvas, the largest of Goya 's tapestry cartoons, portrays a moment of repose from the work in the fields as figures laze in an idyllic, golden landscape. Goya provides a compendium of the expressive possibilities of the human face and figure, from the alarm of the women behind the hay cart to the complete rest of the man lying in front of her. The contrast between the crying baby and the smiling figures at the center of the groups around it brings to mind comments by both Alberti and Leonardo on the difficulty the painter confronts in differentiating these two facial expressions, a feat that Goya proves he is capable of accomplishing. The group standing at the left is particularly interesting in terms of its variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three companions, one of whom fills his glass while another holds his rake and the third steadies him. The central figure 's foolish grin and unfocused, cross-eyed gaze signify his inebriation. His disheveled clothes and spread-legged stance, which suggests a lack of balance, offer a sharp contrast to the graceful pose of the figure with the flask. The somatic disparity between these two figures, and the knowing glances of the other surrounding companions, lend the work a comic tone. <p> The particularity of expression in this composition characterizes several of the sketches and cartoons for tapestries that Goya executed during the later 1780s.( n65) As a whole, these works represent a departure from the round-faced, idealized peasants found in his cartoons of the 1770s, whose formulaic physiognomies are holdovers from the late Baroque style popular during the artist 's youth.( n66) Thus, the sinner in Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent is part of a general shift in Goya 's work toward a more naturalistic mode of imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. These developments continue into the early 1790s and reach a critical stage -- it is tempting to call it a crisis -- in the Yard with Lunatics of 1793-94( Fig. 13). This small-scale work was the last in the series of uncommissioned cabinet paintings that Goya executed during his long convalescence from the life-threatening illness that struck him late in 1792.( n67) Through its violent extremes of facial expression and pose, chaotic jumble of bodies, lack of compositional structure, and inexplicable, frenetic action, this extraordinary painting images madness by subverting the Neoclassical celebration of the nude male form. Given this violation of accepted academic practices, it is not surprising that Goya requested the intervention of Bernardo de Iriarte, vice-protector of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando, in presenting the cabinet pictures to his fellow academicians. Whether the artist 's peers ever saw the Yard with Lunatics, which was still in Goya 's possession when the other works were shown on January 5, 1794, remains unknown. It is hard to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, if not shock them. The artist 's claim in one of his letters to Iriarte that the painting depicts a scene that he had actually witnessed might be read as an attempt to account for its transgression of academic standards by suggesting that it was created according to a set of artistic precepts founded on direct observation rather than idealized imitation.( n68) Imitation and the Expressive Body <p> It is not unreasonable to imagine that an educated viewer -- one more learned than the mother described by Silva -- would have approached Goya 's impenitent man in relation to other depictions of suffering bodies. After all, the 1780s were a time of growing awareness in Spain regarding artistic tradition. In addition to Antonio Ponz 's Viaje de Espana, another important undertaking to make known the glories of Spanish art was the Compania para el Grabado de los Cuadros de los Reales Palacios, an organization established in 1789 to create and disseminate prints of important paintings in the royal collection.( n69) The etchings that Goya made in 1778 after works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered part of this awakening of art historical consciousness, which is reflected in discussions of the art of the past in the orations delivered to the Royal Academy in Madrid.( n70) Against this background, the body of the dying sinner might bring to mind the martyrs found in seventeenth-century Spanish painting, in which physical evidence of torture testifies to a saint 's faith. A work such as Jusepe de Ribera 's Martyrdom of Saint Philip of 1639( Fig. 14) provides a heuristically useful comparison -- in terms of both similarities and differences -- for the tormented body in Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent.( n71) In both of these canvases, the nude male form provides a site on which to inscribe physical torment and, thus, through which to indicate the internal, mental anguish that it induces. <p> Eighteenth-century analyses of Ribera 's work emphasize the same kind of observational veracity and exacting naturalism that Silva admires in Goya 's picture, with Palomino setting the tone for subsequent authors in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devout subjects as much as he liked expressing horrifying and harsh things, such as the bodies of old men : dry, wrinkled, and lean, with gaunt and withered faces, everything done accurately after the model with extraordinary skill, vigor, and elegant technique. "( n72) Mengs provides a similar estimation in his letter to Ponz on the Spanish royal collection, describing Ribera as " admirable in the imitation of the natural, the force of his chiaroscuro and the handling of his brushes, as well as in demonstrating the accidents of the body, such as wrinkles, hair, etc. "( n73) This evaluation conforms to the artistic mode that Mengs describes elsewhere in the text as the " naturalistic style, " and which was exemplified by Velazquez. Thus, from the standpoint of the selective imitation advocated by Mengs and his Spanish followers, Ribera 's painstaking representation of unimproved nature would be seen as indicative of a certain skill, but as pushing the limits of acceptability.( n74) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1772, one suspects that he would have agreed with Mengs 's assessment of Ribera. By contrast, the emphasis on naturalism in his 1795 analysis of Goya 's canvas indicates a dramatic change in outlook, revealing a shift in the theoretical underpinnings of his thought. In contrast to the idealist, Neoplatonic attitude, indebted to Mengs, that had animated Silva 's earlier text, the 1795 oration to the Valencia academy relies on a sensory-based epistemology to explore the issue of imitation. This transformation reflects the significant impact that sensationalism exercised on Spanish aesthetic thought( as well as on many other fields of inquiry) during the 1780s and 1790s.( n75) Its influence is most evident in Esteban de Arteaga 's Investigaciones filosoficas sobre la belleza ideal, published in 1789. In the course of his treatise Arteaga indicates the two most important sources for sensationalist concepts in the eighteenth century, as well as the important implications of this epistemology for the artist : <p> There is no idea or concept in the mind, however spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either directly or indirectly, have its origin in the senses, as Locke and Condillac, among others, have demonstrated ; and therefore there is no object that can not be invested with a corporeal image, and by consequence that is not capable of being imitated more or less perfectly.( n76) <p> In his address of 1795, de Silva alludes not to Locke and Condillac, but rather to the classical source of their ideas, stating that since the time of Aristotle it has been recognized that " the human understanding forms its concepts from no materials other than those that it has received through the senses "( 26). Thus, " the most original compositions... are nothing more than ingenious combinations of particular ideas, each received through the doors of the senses.... "( 27). From this premise follows his assertion that the representation of internal mental states depends on the careful observation of nature : <p> In order to express the passions, the painter needs a reflexive understanding of all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the different modifications of these effects according to the complexion, age, climate, and other individual circumstances of the subject in which they reside( 31). <p> In this passage, the high degree of detail and the emphasis on the entire body differ from the generalized formulas of Le Brun and reflects the importance placed on the study of anatomy as a central component of artistic training in Spain at this time. Anatomy was viewed as one of the auxiliary sciences( together with geometry and perspective) on which artistic education should be founded. Under the influence of Mengs, Felipe de Castro, director of the Royal Academy of S. Fernando, called for the creation of chairs in these disciplines in 1763.( n77) The reexamination of artistic training that took place in the academy during the 1790s reaffirmed the pedagogical value of anatomy. The engraver Juan Adan stressed the significance of its study in his report on education, pointing to the need for " a treatise on anatomy with an exact symmetry of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry and proportion of the body was also underscored in the report given by Manuel Salvador Carmona. Moreover, at a special meeting, held in August 1792, vice-protector Bernardo de Iriarte had emphasized the importance of " a suitable number of good drawings of all parts of the human body and of academies or complete bodies. "( n79) <p> Before the late 1780s, however, discussions of the painstaking study of the human body were balanced by invocations of classical statuary as a normative standard to guide artists away from the accidents of nature and toward the creation of ideal beauty. To this end, the Madrid Academy owned casts after the most famous antique works, and it should come as no surprise that in 1768 Mengs had been entrusted with the task of obtaining these objects. Eventually, at the suggestion of Pedro de Silva, the academy decided in 1773 to acquire Mengs 's own renowned collection of plaster casts.( n80) Of course, travel to Italy offered another avenue by which the aspiring artist could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Goya 's notebook recording his experiences in Italy in the early 1770s reveals the importance of the classical in his own artistic formation.( n81) But his report on education, delivered together with those of other professors and advisers at a special session of the Madrid academy on October 14, 1792, suggests a change in outlook, for it includes a vehement attack on artists who use antique prototypes as pedagogical tools : <p> What a scandal to hear nature deprecated in comparison to Greek statues by one who knows neither the one, nor the other, without acknowledging that the smallest part of Nature confounds and amazes those who know most! What statue, or cast of it might there be, that is not copied from Divine Nature? As excellent as the artist may be who copied it, can he not but proclaim that placed at its side, one is the work of God, and the other of our miserable hands? He who wishes to distance himself, to correct nature without seeking the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monotonous manner, of paintings, of plaster models, as has happened to all who have done this exactly?( n82) <p> Elsewhere in this text Goya speaks about the imitation of nature in terms that suggest the impact of sensationalism : " What a profound and impenetrable arcanum is encompassed in the imitation of divine nature, without which there is nothing good, not only in Painting( that has no other task than its exact imitation) but in the other sciences. " <p> Goya 's emphasis on visual observation at the expense of received models is echoed not by his fellow artists, who by and large remained under the spell of Mengsian classicism, but rather by the advisers to the Madrid academy. The latter group frequently expounded sensationalist views in the prize-giving orations presented during the 1790s. In 1796, for example, the count of Teba asserts : <p> The Artist who adheres to the servile imitation of antique models, as many do as well as teach, will not be more than a miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copying, will have learned some form by heart. I say that the principal model of the Artist is nature, that if he studies it he could achieve invention and know the beauty that exists in it, and by this route he could come to be a master.( n83) <p> Sensationalism had significant implications not just for the means by which the artist creates a work of art but also for the character of the viewer 's response to it. These ramifications are indicated by Silva 's insistence that the effect of Goya 's painting results from the involuntary workings of the beholder 's sensory and cognitive apparatus. It is the artist 's accurate transcription of nature, as we have seen, that activates the expressive potential of the figure through an appeal to the viewer 's sense of sight. Silva was not alone in suggesting that the powerful effect of visual art resulted from the indelible impact of sensory data on human perception. In the oration at the 1799 prize-giving ceremony of the Royal Academy in Madrid, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The glorious deeds, represented by painting or sculpture move us, inflame us, raise the soul, sweep us toward virtue, make us indignant toward vice, and do so with the same violence as the most persuasive, most vehement, and most demonstrative lessons of philosophy.... The instruction that enters by the doors of the senses, aside from being the most durable, accommodates itself best to the common capacity of men. The people are better served by their eyes than their minds.( n84) <p> In this passage, Cabrera puts a sensationalist spin on the Neoclassical principle of the exemplum virtutis : the work of art that in representing a morally didactic theme provides a model for the spectator to emulate.( n85) The Andromache Mourning Hector( Fig. 15) that Jacques-Louis David executed in 1783 as his reception piece, and to which Goya 's painting is frequently compared, epitomizes the idea of representing noble actions intended to serve as a paradigm for the viewer.( n86) By structuring his analysis around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas in Valencia Cathedral, Silva relies on the familiarity of his audience with this concept. However, Goya 's painting inverts the notion of the exemplum virtutis, providing an example to be avoided rather than one to be followed. This message is transmitted by the sinner 's body, its agony signifying not the moral virtue of a fallen Trojan warrior d la David, but rather the unspeakable punishments being enacted on an impenitent man.( n87) Thus, although the forms and compositions of these two works bear some resemblance, the meanings they enact are diametrically opposed. Goya 's picture also differs from the Martyrdom of Saint Philip in this way, for although Ribera 's saint offers a precedent for the representation of physical anguish, he is a figure for the viewer to admire and follow -- at least in terms of the depth of his faith. <p> The comparison with Ribera 's scene of martyrdom helps to illuminate through difference another essential aspect of Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent. Although both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation to portray torments enacted on the human body, Goya 's style in this picture is not limited to a single artistic idiom. This is most apparent in the sharp dissimilarity between the figures of Saint Francis and the sinner. In contrast to the faithful imitation of the dying man 's flesh, the saint 's form is dematerialized, with only his hands and facial features revealed to the viewer. The rest of his body -- even his feet -- is denied to our gaze by the concealing, high-necked garment that he wears. In addition, his graceful, curving gestures are juxtaposed with the rigidity of the sinner 's limbs, and the strong effects of chiaroscuro around the anguished features of the condemned man contrast with the soft, even lighting that illuminates the saint 's face. Moreover, close inspection reveals that the application of paint differs between the two figures, with the face of the sinner having been handled more loosely. Thus, the painting operates through the juxtaposition of two types of imitation : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Francis Borgia.( n88) This contrast enacts formally and stylistically the psychological and spiritual struggle between these figures, giving visual form to the conflict between body and spirit. <p> This line of analysis can be extended a step further, since the demonic creatures lurking in the background conform to yet a third imitative principle that is examined in contemporary aesthetic writing. Although Silva passes over these figures in his analysis of Goya 's painting, in the course of his remarks he touches briefly on the depiction of monsters, referring the audience to his discussion of them in his address before the Madrid academy in 1772, from which we might surmise that his opinion on this topic has not changed. In the earlier text, Silva argues that the artist creates even monsters through the imitation of nature. Citing the strange beast described by the Roman poet Horace in the opening section of his Ars poetica, Silva argues that such creatures are absurd compilations of elements found in nature.( n89) Thus, monsters result from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the artist takes forms that exist independently in nature and fuses them into anomalous combinations that are strange and unsettling rather than beautiful. As Silva states in his address of 1772 : " The same objects that delight us when they are copied are also.., the origin of monsters. "( n90) <p> Silva continues in the 1772 oration by referring to the most important artistic example of such creatures in Spain : the works of Hieronymus Bosch that had entered the royal collection in the second half of the sixteenth century, during the reign of Philip II : <p> Everyone is aware that the delirios of Bosch( who is celebrated for having arrived at the extreme of disorder in his imagination) consist of a joining of figures composed from the most dissonant and strange parts, but such that each part is in itself an accurate copy of some material object that we see everyday.( n91) <p> Similar estimations of Bosch and his art appeared during subsequent years. A prominent example is the publication of Felipe de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared for the first time in 1788 in an edition edited by Antonio Ponz, secretary of the Madrid academy. This text contains a passage on Bosch that argues the same position found in Silva 's address, as Guevara insists that the Flemish artist, unlike some of his followers, always remained within the limits of nature, painting " things that were strange but natural. "( n92) <p> In summary, Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent represents a dual shift in Goya 's art, toward both the natural and the fantastic. At the same time, the figure of the saint indicates the continued influence of the Mengsian principle of ideal beauty. The painting, then, possesses a polyphonic quality that encourages us to consider it as a meditation -- surely unconscious and unintentional -- on the nature of artistic imitation.( n93) It may be that Goya 's personal relationship with the Osunas allowed him the freedom to experiment. In any event, this canvas marks an important crossroads in Goya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to execute in the mid-1790s, starting with the Yard with Lunatics and particularly in the Caprichos, the search for ideal beauty falls away and the dichotomy between naturalism and fantasy becomes a central concern, as it would continue to be for the remainder of Goya 's life. More broadly( and speculatively), one might argue that in bringing together these three competing conceptions of imitation, Goya 's image presents in microcosmic form a set of conflicts -- between classicism and realism, between realism and the imaginary -- that would play themselves out in European art over the course of the next century. <p>
