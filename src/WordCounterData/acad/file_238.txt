4159141 Introduction # As social beings, people need each other at every moment of their lives. In the twenty-first century, mass media and technology have turned the world into a global village. Globalization underlines and stresses global consciousness and dialogue. In this era, humanity needs to learn the importance of coexistence and the dignity entailed in being human. For this purpose, a significant attempt has been made by Christians to rebuild their relationships with different Christian groups and members of other religions. # Even though dialogue among people of different religious traditions has continued throughout history in the form of individual relationships such as friendships, neighborly relations, or business connections, formal and planned **26;10142;TOOLONG dialogue started and became a worldwide movement in the second half of the twentieth century. The role of the Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches can not be denied in this movement, along with the help of technology and modernity. Christian scholars ' positive effects on the Christian call for dialogue should not be missed. Remaining freer from institutional barriers, these scholars could take significant steps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program advisor, Dr. Leonard Swidler, holds a remarkable position. He understands dialogue not only as a theological, philosophical, or practical concept but also as an ontological concept. # By stating a " cosmic dance of the universe, " Swidler is convinced that everything in the universe is naturally in dialogue. In this respect, he stated that " the very essence of our humanity is dialogical, and a fulfilled human life is the highest expression of the cosmic dance of dialogue. " 1 His numerous works and tireless efforts to create an atmosphere of peace at the grassroots and academic levels are significant. The growing global role of the Dialogue Institute at Temple University and the Journal of Ecumenical Studies are among the fruits of his efforts. # In many of our conversations I was able to observe how Swidler is able to witness the historical survey of dialogue, especially the Muslim-Christian dialogue. He was among the scholars who attended the first institutional and organized Muslim-Christian dialogue event in Libya in 1976. Since then, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more accurate information regarding members of other religions. I should also note that Swidler 's special stress on the growing role of Turkish Muslims in interreligious dialogue encouraged me to explore the Turkish response to the Christian call for dialogue. # The question of dialogue within the Turkish context is an important question. Without a worldwide religious authority, every Muslim scholar and community has tried to understand and respond to the Christian call for dialogue in their own way. Turkey, as one of the most influential and modern Muslim-majority states, has joined the discussion about interreligious dialogue, especially with Christians, since the 1980 's. Being very diverse in culture, religion, and thought, Turkish scholars ' discussions and critiques of the interreligious dialogue requested by the Christian world have clearly contributed to such dialogue on a global scale in recent decades. In this respect, it will be helpful to show how the issue of interreligious dialogue is significant in the Turkish context. # Given that the Christian population of Turkey is only about 170,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think the issue of interreligious dialogue is not significant for academic research. However, considering the following points and the ongoing discussions/studies in Turkey, the importance of the study is apparent. # The Importance of Dialogue in the Turkish Context # First of all, the cultural and intellectual heritage of Turkey provides a very broad sense of the issue of dialogue. Turkish, or Anatolian, culture is very rich and composed of many different traditions, ethnicities, and religions. The concept of hospitality is deeply ingrained in the culture and visible in the daily lives of the citizens of the Republic of Turkey, as in other cultures. In respect to dialogue, Anatolian or Turkish intellectual culture encourages people to think about the issue of interreligious dialogue and to pave the way for further discussions and suggestions. # The geographical location of Turkey, which can be compared to a bridge between the East and the West, also pushes it to invest in dialogue. In the southeast, Turkey is surrounded by Muslim-majority countries such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Shi'a-majority country, can open doors to inrrareligious dialogue) ; in the northeast and west it is bordered by Christian-majority countries such as Georgia, Armenia, Bulgaria, and Greece. Since it is a Muslim country among these diverse religious territories, Turkish Muslims pay special attention to the question of coexistence and interreligious dialogue. # The historical background of Turkey, which seems to be one of the most significant reasons, promotes discussion about interreligious dialogue in Turkey. Whether in the Ottoman or Seljuk era, Christians were a significant group within the state and had substantial freedom in comparison to Muslim minorities in Christendom. # The Islamic term " dhimmr designated certain rights to non-Muslims in an Islamic state. Accordingly, Christians, also considered People of the Book, were free to stay in their religion, after giving the jizya and khar? j taxes but were exempt from the zakat that Muslims paid. They were partly autonomous in having their own religious judges and were exempt from military service and participation in wars. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than those of Muslims or humiliating or dressing fancier than Muslims when ringing church bells. One should also note that the dhimma rules were practiced at different levels in different times and places. 3 # Considering the situation of non-Muslims in Seljuk and Ottoman times, one may easily conceive that their situation was far better than that of Muslims in Christian states in the same periods. The dhimma rules were developed in the Ottoman Empire under the millet system, which began under Sultan Mehmed after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. According to this system every religious community was considered a " millel " meaning a community, nationality, or religion. It refers to the distinct legal courts relating to private law under which religious communities were permitted to regulate themselves. So, each millet was headed by its leaders and could have its own religious judges, schools, and organizations. 4 The Ottoman Millet system is generally considered the last and most developed version of religious-cultural pluralism in the Islamic context. 5 # Moreover, the Ottoman government did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the head of the millet represented and was responsible for that community to the Sultan. Every millet had the right to regulate its own laws within loyalty to the state. In the Ottoman Empire, Jews, Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Syrian Orthodox churches were the greatest millets after the Muslim millets. After the Tanzimat( 1839-76), the term " millet has been used to refer to the nation in order to define certain rights of the religious minorities in the state. Since the Ottoman Empire was a Muslim Empire, Muslims( who constitute many different nations such as Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Balkans) were the most privileged millet in the system. Some theological fractions of Islamic sects such as Ale-vi, Bektashi, and Shia were also considered part of the Muslim millet. 6 All these developments that occurred over centuries have made the challenges of interreli-gious dialogue in Turkey a popular subject today. # Globalization as technological development, immigration, and travel, on the one hand, and modernity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " on the other hand, also have a significant role in bringing the issue of dialogue to the agenda of Muslim thinkers. Tourism 's effect must be given special attention. There is a positive correlation between the increasing number of tourists in Turkey and the positive perceptions of Turkish people toward interreligious dialogue. In 2014, nearly 35,000,000 tourists visited Turkey. 7 Comparing this number to Turkey 's population of 76,000,000, this is amazing. This tourism ensures the positive development of the concept of the " other " in Turkey. # Turkey 's bid for membership in the European Union is another significant factor that makes the ongoing discussions more sensitive. The terms for Turkey 's entrance and integration into Europe have gained the special attention of scholars. In 2005, negotiations with the EU started, and as of 2013 many chapters have been opened and fulfilled by the Turkish government. These reform attempts have been observed tentatively and appreciated by most of the Turkish community. Turkish membership in the EU is also debated among scholars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian-majority union. The subject of inter-religious dialogue also has been discussed in terms of Turks ' ability to join a Christian-majority union without losing national and religious values. # Especially in the last decade, Turkey 's foreign relations policies have changed dramatically from a negative/isolated approach to a friendlier attitude. Turkey started to base its relations with neighbors on a " zero problems " principle. 8 For example, following agreements between the governments, travel between Turkey and Georgia became passport-free in 2012.9 Thus, Turkish people can travel to a Christian country -- and Christians to a Muslim country -- more easily, and have the chance to experience a different religious tradition and culture. # Needless to say, after the Arab Spring Turkey 's foreign relations with its regional neighbors turned into an unsteady situation. Turkey 's positive relations with Syria, Egypt, Libya, and Iraq relapsed. The ongoing civil war in Syria, with which Turkey has its longest border, has been negatively affecting the Turkish community. By the end of 2014 there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Syria and Iraq, especially Eastern Christian groups and Ezidies, also bring the question of Muslims ' relations with non-Muslims into question. These developments are other significant factors, which bring the issue of in-terreligious relations with non-Muslims to the attention of Turkish academia. # Hence, Turkey 's developing role as a regional power requires a proper, in-depth analysis of its neighbors ' cultures, religions, and traditions. This requires finding positive links between Turkish and regional cultures, along with ways to hold dialogue with people of different regional cultures and ideologies. # Another significant factor is missionary activities in Turkey. Nationalists frequently pay attention to missionary works by referencing the destructive role of missionaries in the fall of the Ottoman Empire. According to nationalists, there are tremendous numbers of missionaries in Turkey who spread their propaganda very effectively, especially by focusing on Turkey 's sensitive communities such as Kurds and Alevis. According to this nationalist approach, dialogue is another name for missionary work and should be treated carefully. Therefore, rejectionist writings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important portion of Turkish publications on dialogue. Interreligious dialogue and its relationship with missions, hence, becomes a serious question. # Almost 5,000,000 Turks live outside Turkey, mainly in Europe, and remain in contact with Turkey. 10 Their problems of interreligious marriages and relationships also make the issue significant to Turkish academia. For Turks who live outside Turkey, the subject of interreligious dialogue has begun to be a serious issue. # Especially in the last decade, Turkey has also started to discuss diverse Islamic sects, such as the question of Alevis and Bektashis, in workshops organized by the government, various institutions, and think-tanks. 11 This shows a push to accept their respective diversities. Religious ethnic groups have been able to express their diverse opinions more freely by broadcasting on their own TV and radio channels and publishing their own newspapers. They also have organized many meetings to deal with their place in the Turkish public. The problem of living together and in-trareligious dialogue has appeared in these meetings. The final declarations and suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Muslim community. # Turkish minority religious groups also have been active in the last decades in their relationship with Muslims. Their presence in dialogue meetings -- whether academic conferences or social meetings such as iftar dinners, Ramadan celebrations, and Christmas/Easter celebrations -- has intensified over time. In this way, the issue of interreligious dialogue is presented as the only way to create peaceful existence in Turkey. Therefore, the nature of Turkish Christian-Turkish Muslim dialogue is open for contributions and discussions. # Last, but definitely not least, some unfortunate incidents in the last decades about the murdering of priests and Christian missionaries in Turkey have brought the idea of religious tolerance as a remedy for radical religious hatred. 12 Interreligious dialogue is among the most influential ideas that supporters of dialogue usually offer in this respect, so in their writings about Muslim-Christian dialogue they aim to remove such extreme views and actions. # Because of the above-mentioned factors, the issue of interreligious dialogue has a growing place in the Turkish intellectual environment and among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue in Turkey, I can now mention the historical development of organized and institutional interreligious dialogue. # A Short Historical Survey of Dialogue in Modern Turkey # The Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923 after World War I, when the powerful, six-century-old Ottoman Empire collapsed. The new administration certainly believed that if Turkey became laic like Europe, the state would reach the level of Europe. Therefore, Turkey adopted secularism as a state system that considered every citizen equal without distinction of race, religion, sect, or gender. Before the state, every individual has equal opportunities and freedom. Freedom of conscience and religion were confirmed in the Constitution of Turkey, which was changed in 1924, 1937, 1961, and 1982. Needless to say, Turkey also acknowledged the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1954. 13 # However, very strict laicism/secularism, as a reaction to the Ottoman religious administration system, also brought certain restrictions on religious life. For instance, teaching the Qur '? n in public or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim call for prayer) was banned in Arabic( forced to be recited in Turkish). Many books that advocate Islam, such as Risale-i Nurs by Said Nursi, were banned until 1950 when the one-party era ended, after Adnan Menderes 's Democrat Party won the first multi-party general elections. The Democrat Party had brought partial freedom to the citizens, but the government was overthrown by a military coup in 1961, and the prime minister was sentenced to death. # Administrative oppression of the devoted Muslim community, which continued for decades, was partly relieved after Turgut zal, another significant political figure, became prime minister in 1983. His administration was positive and tolerant toward religious people, which made it possible for religious groups to practice their views and collaborate with other groups and communities. # zal died in 1993, but his reforms paved the way for a more democratic Turkey. We observe this positive development after the 1990 's, when a growing number of events and writings of Turkish scholars about interreligious dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered a turning point for interreligious dialogue, at both the official and nongovernmental organization levels. Parallel to political developments and expansion of freedom for religious people and groups, there have been positive developments among governmental( Presidency of Religious Affairs) and nongovernmental institutions and groups. 14 # The Turkish Muslim response to the Christian call for dialogue is varied. The Christian call for dialogue caught the attention of the Turkish people mostly after the 1980 's, when the pressure on religious groups was partly removed, and especially after the mid-1990 's, when Turkey strengthened the negotiations for joining the EU. The Presidency of Religious Affairs handled the issue of interreligious dialogue in the First Religion Shura( Council) held in Ankara in 1993. Interreligious dialogue became one of the distinctive subjects and was comprehensively discussed in the Second Religious Shura held in Ankara in 1998. I should also note that besides these developments, Giilen Movement 's contributions to dialogue have widened the influence and reputation of dialogue. We also observe that since 2003 international conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Until the 2000 's dialogue events were held by academicians in more limited spaces and were not influential within Turkish society. However, after the 2000 's the meetings have been organized with participation of much broader and different social groups. Both religious groups and academicians responded to the dialogue call within their context and according to their perception of the position of Christians in Islamic nations. In the writings of many scholars, we can observe how they perceive the dialogue call differently and how they respond differently -- even in opposite ways. The foregoing analysis has aimed to treat the importance of dialogue in the Turkish context. While the nature of the discussions about the Christian call for dialogue in Turkey is not the specific topic of this essay, it is a significant subject requiring exploration and research. 15 # Conclusion # As Swidler has aptly underscored, during the past era of divergence, it was easy to live in isolation. However, our contemporary age is the age of convergence, and thus we are forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world now faces two major choices. People must understand the importance of learning from others, or they will challenge others, which pushes toward another world war. The title of the book co-authored by Swidler -- Death or Dialogue? -- vividly captures this important point. 17 The Turkish answer for this crucial question is also important in the world where communities are linked to each other more than at any time before. # As I have shown, it is clear that dialogue is strongly embedded with Turkish culture, history, tradition, politics, and everyday life. We, as the scholars of religion, should discover, develop, and promote the positive elements in our communities in order to bring people to the table of dialogue on a sound and secure basis. In this respect, I should also note that there are many Turkish scholars and academicians who pursue critical thinking and self-criticism and develop an intellectual version of Islam. I am sure that, regardless of any sociopolitical barriers, the Turkish scholars who have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of Islam, will exist and always work for developing Islamic civilization. # Finally, considering the growing critical role of Turkey in the contemporary world and the current tensions in Turkey, prospective analyses about Turkish perceptions of and responses to the Christian call for dialogue would definitely provide a more objective picture regarding non-Muslims ' place in the Muslim world. Turkey is in a time of critical transformation. Hence, such scholarly reviews of Turkish scholars and official governmental and nongovernmental attitudes toward the Christian call for dialogue will be helpful to English readers to understand what is going on in Turkey regarding interreligious dialogue. # *I developed this essay from a part of my doctoral thesis completed at Temple University, Philadelphia, in 2014, titled " Turkish Response to the Christian Call for Dialogue.
