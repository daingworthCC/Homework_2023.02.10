4009341 The supervisor of interns in the public schools needs to be a caring person who has excellent human relations skills. He/she needs to have carefully chosen objectives to implement in providing the best of experiences for interns. The intern of today needs to be a professional who will soon be a teacher of America 's most precious heritage -- our children. <p> Interns and cooperating teachers, working as a team, need assistance from the university supervisor so that the former develops into becoming a professional teacher. I have supervised interns for approximately thirty years and find that there are something like ten principles of learning that are very worthwhile for supervisory purposes. Interns do need to be given guidance and guidelines to perform at the highest level possible. These guidelines might well be called principles of learning, devised from the psychology of education( Ediger, 1994). Principles of Learning and the Intern <p> First, the intern needs to be given assistance to provide meaningful learning opportunities for pupils in the public schools. To possess meaning, pupils should be able to say in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils indicate that they understand what has been learned. Perhaps, the indicator here should also stress other than verbal ways to reveal what has been learned. Howard Gardner( 1993) has identified nine intelligences, also called Multiple Intelligences( MI). Thus there are the following ways that interns should realize that pupils may indicate learning that have been acquired. These intelligences are : verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily/kinesthetic, nature and the natural world, the human condition, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. For example, pupils taught might reveal learnings through any of these nine intelligences. Thus instead of showing learnings through interpersonal means( committee work), the pupil may wish to work alone( intrapersonal approaches). Or, instead of indicating what has been learned through oral approaches( verbal/linguistic), the learner might wish to reveal what has been learned through an art project( visual, spatial). The method chosen by pupils to reveal learnings acquired might well depend upon a preferred intelligence, from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a meaningful way for a pupil to show what has been achieved. <p> Second, the intern needs to provide interesting learning opportunities to pupils. These learning opportunities capture the interests of students. Attention is then given to the activity/experience provided by the intern. Interest in learning is a powerful factor in having pupils achieve as well as possible. With careful planning, the intern might well capture pupil attention through interesting activities being presented, the pupil and the curriculum have then become one, not separate entities. With interest in learning, the pupil can better concentrate on the presentations being offered by the intern. A variety of learning opportunities has a better chance of obtaining learner interests as compared to a single or a few activities( Ediger, Elementary Education, 1996). <p> Third, the intern needs to guide pupils to perceive purpose in learning. With purpose, reasons are accepted by the pupil for participating in ongoing activities. The accepted reasons for participating in the curriculum make for active involvement in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the middle, and the end of each unit of study. If pupils are not attending to the lesson and unit being taught, they should be reminded of the purposes involved in learning at different intervals in the unit of study. <p> Fourth, quality sequence should be in the offing for pupils in ongoing lessons and units of study. With good sequence, previously acquired knowledge and skills provide readiness for new goals to be achieved. The sequence experienced by pupils makes for new goals to be achieved. The sequence experienced by pupils makes for increasingly more complex learnings for each pupil. Learners individually should experience optimum growth and achievement. In a logical sequence, the intern/cooperating teacher determine the order of objectives for pupil attainment. In a psychological sequence, the pupil orders his/her own experiences such as in individualized reading. Usually, there will be both logical as well as psychological experiences for pupils in the classroom setting. <p> If the new objective is excessively difficult to attain, frustration on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequential objective is too easy to achieve, boredom might well set in on the part of the learner. By observing and learning as much as possible about each learner in the classroom, the intern might well provide better sequence in learning. <p> Fifth, problem solving skills need to be developed by pupils. Problem solving is important presently in school as well as in society. With problem solving stressed in all curriculum areas, the intern must set the stage for this type of learning. Thus, pupils perceive a need for problem identification. A problem is then developed by the learner individually or within a collaborative setting. The problem needs to possess clarity so solutions can be found. After the problem is clear to learners, information should be found in terms of securing answers. A variety of reading and audiovisual aids needs to be used as information sources. Also, it is vital for pupils to use modern technology in information gathering. The answer to the problem is tentative, not final, The tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Problem solving certainly emphasizes higher levels of cognition as a skill. This is a challenging kind of learning experience for which pupils put forth mush effort since they identified the problem and went through the flexible steps with intern/cooperating teacher assistance. Generally with interest and purpose in a problem area identified, pupils will carry out the tasks to completion, even though difficulties are involved( Smith, 1996). <p> Sixth, critical thinking is important to emphasize in ongoing lessons and units of study. With critical thought, pupils are encouraged to make comparisons and contrasts in information obtained. Pupils should also analyze fact from opinion, accurate from inaccurate statements as well as reality from fantasy. Critical thinking is important for learners in many ways. Here, the pupil sorts out what is good, true, and beautiful from that which tends to be the opposite, such as drug abuse, alcoholism, physical abuse among other forms of abuse, and unwholesome sexual relations. Worthy contributions to the self without self destructive behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of all. <p> Seventh, pupils need assistance by the intern/cooperating teacher to stress pupils engaging in creative thinking. With creative thought, pupils come up with novel ideas, unique to the self. These ideas are attempts to close gaps in knowledge and skills possessed. Improvements certainly do come about due to creative minds and endeavors. When changes are made from what is to what should be, someone or some group has been creative in thinking to close gaps. Originality of thought, not conformity, emphasizes creativity. <p> Eighth, The intern not only should develop interests of learners in a new unit of study, but also maintain involved interests. Many interns find it difficult to assist pupils to maintain interests in the learning opportunities provided. The best bet here is for the intern to provide a variety of learning activities for pupils. There are many opportunities for pupils to learn from. These include incorporating diverse reading materials, computers, internet, E-mail, videotapes, filmstrips, slides, cassettes, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With a variety of learning opportunities used in each unit of study taught, pupils may find those which assist in providing for individual talents, interests, and abilities. Each pupil should be assisted to achieve as optimally as possible. Interpersonal and intrapersonal development are equally important. Pupils individually should achieve well in the academic, social, emotional, and physical arenas. These area of growth need to be reflected in the different learning opportunities provided for pupils. <p> Ninth, the intern should assist pupils to use the community in learning. There are excellent learning opportunities in using excursions to link the school and the community. School and community should not be isolated from each other. Pupils are in school presently and later on will be working in a work place. It is good presently to stress pupils being an integral part of society. Pupils also need to become worthy members of and contribute in the societal arenas. Organizations such as 4H, Girls Scouts, Boy Scouts, Campfire Girls, among other wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, increasingly so, as they progress through the sequential levels of schooling( Ediger, Journal of Instructional Psychology, 1996. <p> Tenth, pupils need to become responsible individuals. The home and school need to work together for the good of the pupil to achieve more optimally. Which are selected areas of responsibility for pupils to achieve in? Homework assignments made by the intern/cooperating teacher need to be completed by pupils. If pupils do not understand what to do in homework assignments, they should ask questions so that responsible behavior is in evidence. An appropriate place to study should be in the offing. The home and the school should have conferences frequently so that the pupil may build on past experiences and attain relevant objectives. In the home setting, there are numerous responsibilities for pupils to be involved in such as keeping their own rooms neat, clean and tidy. Conclusion <p> It is important for interns to use desired principles of learning from the psychology of education. These guidelines provide direction and guidance in selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should achieve more optimally as a result. <p> Interns/cooperating teachers who are well prepared for each lesson and unit taught should fare well in the instructional arena. Pupils who do not do well should have their work diagnosed to determine the cause(s) for a lack of progress. Specific reasons for a lack of pupil progress are then noticed. A new strategy of instruction should be in the offing. Learners need to be challenged to attain as much as individual abilities permit( See Ediger, 1997). <p>
