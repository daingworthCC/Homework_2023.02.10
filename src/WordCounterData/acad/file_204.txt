4117441 The Holy Grail of screenwriting is a story that will immediately make agents, producers, directors and actors sit up and take notice. A recent rereading of the advertising classic Ogilvy on Advertising revealed that David Ogilvy, the godfather of modern advertising, had the prescription not only for ads with big ideas but also scripts. </p> " You will never win fame and fortune, " he writes, " unless you invent big ideas. It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night. " </p> In screenplay terms, this does n't mean you have to write one of those big summer action movies. In this case, " big " means impactful. A " small " film can have big ideas -- for example, the issue of having a child when you 're not in a relationship, which was the theme of the very successful film Juno. Another example is the classic novel and film To Kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inspiration for their careers. </p> Ogilvy suggested asking yourself five questions to determine whether something really is a big idea : </p> * Did it make me gasp when I first saw it? </p> * Do I wish I had thought of it myself? </p> * Is it unique? </p> * Does it fit the strategy to perfection? </p> * Could it be used for 30 years? </p> In movie terms, questions one through three make sense as they are. For question four we might substitute, " Does it fulfill the demands of the genre to perfection? " In other words, if it 's a comedy, is it really funny? If it 's a horror picture, is it truly scary? And the fifth question could translate to, " Will people still want to see it in 30 years? " </p> It 's a tall order, and probably only one out of 100 or 1,000 of your ideas will let you answer yes to all five questions. All the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a true winner. </p> Would n't it be easier just to try to follow a formula? You know, the hero 's journey, the three acts, the 22 steps, or one of the other templates. Could you not just fill in the blanks? </p> The answer is no. You 're not going to get a unique story by slavishly making your story fit a predetermined pattern. Here 's what Ogilvy said about how to come up with these kinds of big ideas : " Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science, and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed, or your idea will be irrelevant. Stuff your conscious mind with information, then unhook your rational thought process. " </p> My point is not to demonize the idea of the three-act structure or the hero 's journey, etc., but to say they should be your servants, not your master. Your story, which comes from the unconscious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft of screenwriting, must come first. </p> Your big idea can take many forms. The core of a big idea could also be called the theme. Probably it will be something about which you feel strongly. The great advantage screenwriters and novelists have is that they can clothe their beliefs so well in entertainment, with such a great choice of genres, that even a familiar theme can become fresh again. The way that you express your theme often is the part of the big idea that makes people take notice. </p> For example, one of the great lessons of life is that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is to let them go. This could be addressed in a romantic drama in which the lovers realize that their dreams for their lives are too different, or a drama about the spouse of a terminally ill person who is refusing further treatment. </p> It could even be addressed in a science-fiction context-indeed, it was, in E.T., when young Eliott realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must help him leave. </p> Finding a new way to express a universal theme is key. It certainly worked for Steven Spielberg, and also for James Cameron when he decided to re-tell the Romeo and Juliet tale on a sinking ship. </p> Ways to get a big idea Here 's how you can encourage your subconscious mind to come up with the kind of big ideas that fit Ogilvy 's criteria : </p> * Keep a record of your dreams. Many unique stories, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, have been inspired by dreams. </p> * Read widely, especially stories that have stood the test of time, as part of your campaign to make your unconscious well-informed. </p> * Take a notebook with you wherever you go, so you can catch fleeting thoughts( or you can record them using your cell phone). </p> * When you see a movie that has an emotional impact on you, that you feel compelled to talk about to your friends, that you want to see again, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much harder to conjure than the special effects in big-budget movies. </p> * Have regular brainstorming sessions where you start with a list of random words and see what ideas each one prompts. When you are brainstorming, remember to go for quantity and do n't judge the ideas as you go along. Write down all the ideas that come up, even the ones you know immediately are bad ones. </p> Later, when you sit down to evaluate what you 've come up with, you may find that combining two " bad " ideas results in one great one. Simply retelling the Romeo and Juliet story in a conventional setting would have been a weak idea, as would re-telling only the story of the Titanic 's demise. It was the combination of the two that made Titanic a huge hit. </p> A few things to play with When you have decided on a theme and want to explore a variety of ways to make it fresh, here are some elements you can play with : </p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford, benefits from taking place largely within an Amish community because it brings a man who lives by the gun into a location where nonviolence is the highest value. </p> * The gender of the protagonist. As stereotypes dissolve, this is not as big a factor as it once was, but reversing the expected roles can still add novelty, especially in comedies. One example is making Arnold Schwarzenegger a kindergarten teacher in Kindergarten Cop. </p> * The nature of the players. </p> Would your story work as an animated film? Or could one or more of your characters be a robot, an alien, or a talking animal? District 9 created a fresh take on apartheid by making the oppressed minority aliens. </p> The point is not to come up with a gimmick for the sake of it ; the goal is to find a means of telling the story that transforms it into a big idea. When you try out some of these variations you may find that you have a sudden " Aha! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop too soon When brainstorming, it 's tempting to stop when we have a good idea. As writers, we are itching to get to the good part -- the actual writing of the script. But, as Ogilvy knew, the really big ideas are rare. When you have a good concept, continue to generate more. And then generate some more yet. It 's not the good idea you 're looking for ; it 's the great one. </p> When you 've found that, and written a terrific screenplay based on it, you may have created something unique that will make people gasp, that other writers will wish they 'd thought of, that is right on target for its genre, and that will still be on people 's " must-see " list in 30 years ' time. </p> If you can do that, Hollywood and the international film industry will be clamoring for your work. Now there 's a big idea! </p> A few screenwriting ' commandments ' that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenwriters offer my take on " The Ten Commandments of Scriptwriting( and why you should break them). " Following are some of those " rules. "( Read the piece in full in the Top Tips section of yourwritingcoach.com, and sign up for my free newsletter at screenwritingsuccess.com.) </p> Thou shalt make thy protagonists likable. Did you like the godfather( the man, not the film)? Hannibal Lecter? Did you like Rick in Casablanca( at least for the first two-thirds of the film)? Probably not, but odds are you found them fascinating. If your script makes us want to see what happens next to the protagonist, that 's enough. </p> Thou shalt make thy dialogue short. One screenwriting book actually dictates, " Do n't write any dialogue longer than three lines. " Hmm, just as well Tarantino did n't read that before writing Pulp Fiction, or Alan Ball before writing American Beauty. If you have intelligent, articulate characters, why gag them? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the audience wo n't balk at longer speeches. </p> Thou shalt have a villain opposing thy protagonist. This is n't actually wrong, just not always necessary. Obviously, if you 're writing a flick in which terrorists are trying to blow up the world or a serial killer is stalking your detective, you 'll need a good bad guy. But many of the most interesting films look at how we can be our own worst enemy, or how we have to battle our circumstances( The Full Monty, Annie Hall, Citizen Kane). These films are harder to write because they do n't fit as easily into structural formulas and they ask the writer to look more deeply into himself. They can be tougher to sell because they do n't appeal to the youngest audiences. However, when they work, they 're the kinds of movies that stick in peoples minds for years. </p> Thou shalt write full character biographies and outlines. For some writers, having an exact road map for their script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For others, it takes all the creative joy out of writing. Each of us has to find our own way. For example, I have found that getting to know my characters via visualizations is a hundred times more effective than writing character bios-but it might not work that way for you. </p> Thou shalt not be original. Surely nobody is saying " Do n't be original "? Oh yes they are, just not in those exact words. Many of the scriptwriting books tell you it 's poison to write for older protagonists( tell that to the makers of Waking Ned Devine), or in an unpopular genre( see Unforgiven), or complex stories that may confuse the audience( like The Usual Suspects?). The fact is that every breakthrough film is, by definition, different from the norm. </p> Thou shalt make thy endings happy. Did Pulp Fiction have a happy ending? What about American Beauty? What about Y Tu Mam Tambin?. A lot of excellent films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real life rather than the neat conclusions of many Hollywood studio offerings. Of course, there 's nothing wrong with a happy ending, if it fits your story, but if it does n't, stay true to your story. </p> By Jurgen Wolff </p> Jurgen Wolff has written more than 100 TV episodes for shows that include Family Ties, Benson and Relic Hunter.
