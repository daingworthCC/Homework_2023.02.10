4003841 Previous to 1940 fewer than 10 percent of women living in the western Navajo reservation gave birth in a hospital, but by 1970 the percentage of hospital births was nearly 100 percent( Kunitz 1976, 16). Leighton and Kluckholn stated in 1948, " Today an increasing number of Navajo women go to the Indian Service hospitals for delivery, but they still form a trifling portion of the total "( Leighton and Kluckholn 1948, 15). The greatest shift toward hospital birth occurred in the late 1950s. The implications of this shift are worth examining to increase understanding of Indigenous knowledge about childbirth and how it contributes to positive birth outcomes. <p> Infant mortality data is scarce before the introduction of hospital birth, though it appears it was high. In the late 1950s in the Many Farms -- Rough Rock area of the Navajo reservation, Loughlin found the general infant mortality rate to be much higher than the national average. The neonatal mortality rate, however, was comparable or better than the national rate, in spite of the fact that only an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Loughlin 1969). Separating the neonatal( within thirty days of birth) from the postneonatal( after thirty days of birth) infant mortality indicates that the neonatal deaths were comparable to that of the general population. This suggests that factors associated with childbirth itself were not the likely cause of the high infant death rate. <p> I was pregnant in 1979 and began to ask my mother-in-law about childbirth. She had sixteen children at home and was a deep well of information. The more I learned, the more my interest grew, and soon I was asking other women about their experiences. I was also in a doctoral program in public health, but I initially did not consider childbirth to be an academic subject. My motive for asking questions about childbirth was only my interest in the subject. A an Indigenous woman I had some anxiety about proving myself as a professional and did not think a " woman 's subject " would improve my professors ' perceptions of me. My passion for talking to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begay 1985), though I have rarely spoken about the dissertation and have never sought to publish anything about it until now. I conducted lengthy interviews with twenty-one mothers who had given birth at home, most of whom were over forty years of age at the time of the interview. I also interviewed fifty women who gave birth in Navajo reservation hospitals. My methodology was anthropological, not survey based. Since I was a pregnant Native woman living on the Navajo reservation, I spent many hours sitting in Indian Health Service waiting rooms. I also went to chapter meetings, the Shonto trading post and Post Office, Enemy Way Ceremonies( sometimes called squaw dances), and the Shonto Bureau of Indian Affairs School where my daughter was a day student. I also worked on a number of community projects and attended community meetings. I was a participant observer, which is neither a method nor a kind of data, but it allowed me to spend many hours listening to women and their husbands talk about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued until 1983. <p> In 1955 the U.S. Public Health Service took responsibility for medical care on the Navajo reservation. At the same time increasing numbers of children were being sent to boarding schools for most of the year. Even though children were still being born at home in the 1960s, their older brothers and sisters were often away at school at the time. These school children knew that they had younger siblings born at home, but few of these children were actually able to observe the birth of siblings. A consequence of this was that knowledge about childbirth practices at home began to disappear. Since much information about life outside the purview of formal education is " caught not taught, " there were few opportunities for young people to learn about traditional childbirth practices. <p> The women I interviewed who were first-time mothers in the 1960s and 1970s knew little about what to expect when delivering in the hospital. They rarely went to prenatal visits and had seldom been to the hospital at all before childbirth. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first child in the hospital during this time period spoke of being somewhat afraid and relieved that they were going to the hospital when in labor. They had a sense that there was some danger in childbirth and that the hospital was a safe, though alien, place. The older women who had their babies at home before the 1960s said that they were not afraid of childbirth. They did not think that the hospital was a safer place to have a baby than at home. Those who later had other children in the hospital said that it was not because it was safer but because the hospital could give them pain medication and that they were given gifts to take home -- diapers, baby clothes, shampoo, and soap. They also were pleased that the hospital saved their family from having to go through much trouble for them. <p> According to the ages of the women I interviewed, giving birth in the hospital because of safety was not a major consideration until several years after the Public Health Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a safe experience was unexpected ; I had assumed that women welcomed hospital birth in order to feel safer than being at home. Most women in the United States today feel that the hospital is a safe place for childbirth and that medical intervention can save a potentially dire birth outcome. A possible consequence of this changed attitude about the safety of the hospital is a greater propensity for pursuing legal action if there is a poor birth outcome at the hospital. There were, however, systems to provide women both support and healthy outcomes before the introduction of modern childbirth practices. To assume that nothing existed before the new system was introduced not only makes it dif cult to perceive that there was a change in attitudes about childbirth but also allows the knowledge about the previous systems to pass from existence. <p> PRENATAL SUPPORT <p> All the women I interviewed, both young and old, told me that during pregnancy a woman should stay busy. This would keep the baby from growing too large and would also keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered unwise to dwell too much on the future. Baby showers were considered to be tempting fate. Every woman talked about proscriptions during pregnancy. There was a large variety of prohibitions, some of which they did not feel were important any longer. For example, one woman said it used to be thought that one should not eat tomatoes during pregnancy, probably, she said, because of their blood-like red color. She laughed at this and said that now no one worried about tomatoes. Many older women thought that asking or talking about old taboos was odd, if not unwholesome, for a pregnant woman. <p> One of the most common prohibitions in pregnancy dealt with tying knots and performing actions that involve binding and lacing such as weaving and saddling horses. In the Navajo origin story of the birth of the hero twins, Changing Woman 's birth is blocked by the binding of a doorway. Not all the younger women had heard this story, but nearly every woman had a personal story about not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had half-finished a basket when her grandmother made her undo it. Binding and tying are symbolically associated with slow deliveries, and these images are used in other cultures as well. A common practice for a Navajo midwife in a slow delivery was to unravel a crochet stitch while the laboring woman watched. <p> Other restrictions in pregnancy related to the health of the baby as well as the well-being of the mother. Many of these are still practiced. These included staying away from things associated with death, disability, uncontrolled power, and spirits. Dead animals, broken dolls, ancient ruins, and trees truck by lightening were some of the things mentioned by interviewees. Often, these stories were told when something was wrong with the baby and had to be corrected by a ceremony. An example was a baby girl who failed to gain weight a few months after she was born. The mother took the baby to the Indian health clinic first and then to a Navajo diagnostician who said that the family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looked at dead animals. There were many stories about avoiding things that could cause a woman mind to be sad, scared, unhappy, and " out of harmony. " <p> Preparation for childbirth in Navajo culture involved preparing the psyche to be harmonious with life. A proper attitude meant to think that the world is beautiful and that one is happy to be alive. The women interviewed expressed the idea that a pregnant woman should work diligently and think of herself as strong and healthy. She should not be jealous or envious of others. One of the ways in which women in my sample said that they increased their feelings of harmony was to have a Blessingway ceremony. A " singer "( Hataalii, medicine man) explained that there was a special and shortened version of the Blessingway ceremony that was particularly suitable for pregnant women. My informants agree that this ceremony should take place toward the latter part of pregnancy, generally a month or two before the birth is expected. Not all the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all knew about it and had been to at least one for someone else if not their own. Since it requires the services of a singer, some women felt that they should save the money a singer would cost and were satisfied that labor and delivery proceeded well without the ceremony. Other, mostly older, women thought it was important to have the ceremony. One older woman said that the Blessingway was like a prenatal checkup, a reinforcement of positive thoughts. She had never been to a prenatal checkup herself, but she thought they must be for the same purpose. <p> For many of the Navajo women I interviewed, the main function of the prenatal checkup was perceived as being the same as the Blessingway ceremony : to increase positive thoughts and ensure that things go well during childbirth. A woman who had four children and was pregnant with her fifth explained that she did not go to prenatal exams with her first four children but had a Blessingway ceremony instead. She now felt that the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to buying materials and a basket. She felt that she did not need the ceremony as long as she went to prenatal exams and her Indian Health Service provider told her that everything was fine. <p> Another young woman said that her first labor had been extremely painful ; she had the ceremony before the next child was born, and she thought it was worth it because her labor was easier. Since most of the women perceived that the Public Health Service provided a substitute in prenatal checkups, they felt that it was a luxury to have a ceremony. <p> Many Public Health Service providers did not expect the attitude that the purpose of the prenatal checkup is to ensure harmony. Nonetheless, sensitive providers responded to the pregnant woman 's need for reassurance. The women I interviewed spoke positively about prenatal providers who told them that everything would be fine ; if they were told negative information they sought to change examiners or even go to another clinic. One woman, whose first child was a caesarian birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered caesarian ; and she ceased going to the prenatal visits. When she went into labor, she made her husband drive her two hundred miles to another hospital on the reservation because she felt that the Tuba City personnel were not harmonious toward her. <p> TRADITIONAL CHILDBIRTH AND POSTPARTUM <p> When a woman 's labor began a log was brought into the home and secured so that a rope or sash belt could be suspended from it. This rope might also be suspended from the ceiling instead of a log. A place was prepared for the laboring woman to sit next to the log. Most often the husband was the one who made these preparations. If the floor of the home was dirt, he dug out a shallow circle and may have put smooth sand from a stream bed in it to encourage a smooth flowing birth. If the floor was not dirt, he created this place by bringing in the sand and putting it on the floor, making a shallow nest with the sand. The sand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly cleaned cloth or sheets. <p> The husband or another person sat, knelt, or stood behind the woman and held her tight against him with his arms around her and his hands knit together just under her breasts and over her pregnant belly. As the labor contractions intensified, the husband or other holder attempted to feel the contraction and tighten his embrace with a pressure corresponding to the tightness of the contraction. At the same time the woman pulled on the rope or sash with increasing force during the contraction. By having both a person hold her from behind and holding herself with the rope, a woman was able to stay in an upright, supported position during labor. In addition, the support and warmth of the holder could be felt on the woman 's back. According to the Navajo origin story this holding person has good intentions for the laboring mother. Many women in my sample stated that it was important that this person be someone who cared for them. Most of the women said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some said their own mother took this role. <p> It was also primarily the husband 's role to keep a fire going during the labor. This was done even if the labor took place in summer. Among the interview participants, it was thought important to keep the laboring mother warm. The wood stove usually had a pot of water with the inner bark from a juniper boiling on it, and juniper tea might be given to the woman during labor, though often this was only given after the baby was born. The husband cut juniper branches and kept them warm by placing them near the wood stove for use after the birth. The woman took her hair down and removed her jewelry and anything else that might be binding to her. The room was aromatic with the smell of juniper. <p> If a singer or medicine man was with a woman during labor, he sang Blessingway songs. The songs of the Blessingway come from the origin stories of the Navajo, and chanting them during the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification with ancestors, the Holy people, and the Universal Forces of Life. In giving birth to a new person, the woman is spiritually joined to both the past and the future. The words and chants of the singer inspired her to feel these spiritual connections. Pollen blessing is essential in every Blessingway ceremony. During labor the singer dipped an eagle feather in pollen and brushed it in a downward motion over the woman. This has been called " chasing out the baby. " By his words and gestures, the singer focuses the woman 's attention in letting the baby loose. This focusing not only affected the parturient woman but the other supportive participants as well, especially the husband, who was usually holding his wife. The singer did not touch the couple or in any way come between them, and he sought to enhance their concentration on the experience and avoid any distraction. This concentrated state that the singer brings about or enhances is described by Bailey( 1950). He observed an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in labor for four days. When the doctor attempted to examine her, she became greatly distressed and appeared in such pain that he gave up the examination. When the singer began chanting again, her serenity returned. She gave birth the next day( Bailey 1950, 53). <p> The woman was held and supported until the placenta was delivered. She was given juniper tea to help her uterus to contract as she rested on her mat. Warm juniper branches were tied around her belly, and she inhaled their fragrance for the same purpose. Immediate care of the newborn required clearing the mucus out of its mouth and nose. This was accomplished by administering small amounts of weak tea or warm water to the baby so that it would spit or sneeze. An attendant bathed and swaddled the baby and placed it with its head toward the fire. Women said that they would not nurse right after the baby was born because the mucus passages must be totally cleared of phlegm before nursing. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellious and demanding, causing his family much grief. <p> After the birth, the mother was said to be like a newborn herself. Both she and her baby were described as being soft and pliable. She ate only soft food and did not pull at her skin or scratch herself. Women spoke about being able to manipulate their newborn 's features to make them more attractive. Most of the women in my sample said that it was possible to shape the features but that it is better to leave the baby alone and let it be the way he or she was born. Another practice was for a postpartum woman to put the baby 's meconium on her face to remove any dark pigmentation( melasma gravidarum) that she may have acquired during pregnancy. In 1983 several hospital nurses I poke with said that they had observed women doing this, though the practice seemed to be decreasing. <p> Five women I interviewed had births both at home and at the hospital. One said they were different but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women liked the traditional way better because they thought it was faster and less painful when someone was holding them. In addition, a young woman said her grandmother told her that the old way of childbirth was probably better because it gave women something to do instead of just lying down. Another woman related a story of her hospital experience that combined some of the traditional methods. She was in the hospital and said that the nurse left her because she was not ready for delivery. She said the nurse told her to lie down and wait a while. But after the nurse left, she said that her mother and sister told her to get up ; they held her up while she pushed, and she said the baby was born right there in the labor room. <p> TWO HOME BIRTHS IN 1984 AND 1989 <p> I was pregnant in 1984 and had prenatal care at the Inscription House Health Center, located in the Kayenta Service Unit of the Indian Health Service. I was writing my dissertation about childbirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Monument with my husband and our two children. My youngest child had been born four years earlier while I was a student at Berkeley. Her older sister was enrolled at the Shonto Bureau of Indian Affairs School. Since I had spent the last four years talking to people about childbirth, taking copious notes about it, and thinking about it and was now finishing my dissertation on the subject, I thought that I should have my next child at home using the traditional childbirth practices. My mother-in-law said she would help and my father-in-law, a Hataalii( singer), said he would be there. They and my husband had everything prepared ahead of time : a log, bucket of river sand, and clean sheets. <p> I told my doctor and friend at Inscription House what we intended to do. He asked me what role I wanted him to play at the birth. I said I wanted him there just as an observer and as someone who could give advice if something went wrong. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled near my due date and said he would try to get some of the other providers in the Kayenta Service Unit to give support, should he be unavailable. He later told me that all the providers in the Service Unit were violently opposed to his supporting me. I heard that some of the doctors were very angry that I had asked him to do this and that he had agreed to it. He did talk his nurse into giving support. Although she tried to convince me to forget the plan, she reluctantly agreed to help because of her loyalty to the doctor. <p> At my last prenatal visit, the doctor said he was leaving for his trip, that I should not worry, and that he would be back before I delivered. I asked him if he could give us one of the sterile emergency childbirth packs that they kept in the clinic with sterile clamps and scissors. We knew that was against all the rules, but he did it anyway. A day or two later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon of August 29, 1984. I was fixing dinner around five o'clock in the evening and had to stop with each contraction. My husband drove to get his parents, who lived about ten miles away on a dirt road. He returned and told me that they were not home, but he left a picture message for them. He began to plead with me to let him drive me to the Tuba City hospital. I told him it was too late. <p> Shortly thereafter, his parents drove up and everything fell into place. They and my husband brought in the log, fixed a nest on the floor, built a fire, and cut the juniper branches. My mother-in-law held me during labor. To me it was like when you hurt yourself and run to your mother and she hugs you and makes it better. It was like she hugged each contraction. The daylight began to fade and the room was warm. I was in early labor and thinking that I was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way to go. I got up to use the bathroom and when I returned my father-in-law began singing and brushing me with the feather and pollen. All of a sudden I felt the baby descending from me in one huge contraction. I lifted my skirt, and to my own and everyone 's amazement the baby boy had slid out and was staring at me and crying. The room was a rosy pink color, and it seemed to radiate from the baby. Maybe it was the sun setting, but everyone in the room saw the same color of light. <p> My husband used items in the sterile pack to clamp and cut the cord, discussing with his mother where to cut. My mother-in-law washed the baby and then used the same water to pour over the two older girls ' hair, saying that they would not be jealous of the new baby because they were washed with the same water. Today this baby is nearly a twenty-year-old young man. <p> Four years after his birth, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves. This time it was during a severe snowstorm in January. I was working for the Indian Health Service in Kayenta at the time, and I again had a doctor/friend who agreed to support me but could not attend because of the snowstorm and the rough road. The pictures in this article are of this birth. <p> Today my children are grown and my oldest daughter is pregnant with our first grandchild. Twenty years passed quickly. I am reminded of the ninety-year-old Navajo woman who said, <p> The old way of childbirth was a lot of work. You had to prepare and butcher sheep and give things away. It seems easier to go to the hospital and have them take care of everything. But now I think about how much is given away to make things easier. Families were closer then. The birth of a child was prepared for from the time of the wedding.... Birth then was a ceremony. It wa regarded as a holy experience. It brought the family together. PHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way, but it does n't do everything( BB, 1979). <p> Navajo childbirth practices at home were learned primarily by observation, and childbirth education took place without classes. It was part of the total system of life in which knowledge was acquired without institutional instruction. The Public Health Service and the institution of boarding schools in the 1950s were major influences in the rapid alteration of that life system and brought about universal hospitalization for childbirth by 1970. Many modern Navajo mothers have retained a desire to have their families with them in childbirth, but institutionalization has diminished the family 's responsibility and role in supporting the women in childbirth. Navajo midwives have completely ceased practicing, although the Hataalii may still play a role today. Navajos in Indian Health Services have made an effort to return some of the traditional practices to the Indian Health Services hospitals on their reservations, but the system in which childbirth took place in the home is changed. <p> I was fortunate to have had a traditional family with knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childbirth practices. Not all Indigenous women have these resources. The advent of modern medical services made traditional practices obsolete and of little value according to the dominant society 's standards. My children grew up on the Navajo reservation, but they heard criticism and teasing for being a " John " and doing things " the John way. " In American society this is like calling someone a " hillbilly " or " yokel. " Like the other children, they wanted to emulate what they saw on television. It was not until my daughter left the reservation for a summer school program that she began to want to know more about Navajo history and language. <p> Letting go of the old ways is letting go of our own experience and our own selves. In childbirth women need something to hold on to for support, both literally and figuratively. The sash belt symbolizes that support. It weaves together the past into the present. Pregnancy and childbirth is a time in a woman 's life when she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that she feels and understands this connection in order to create a more meaningful birth experience. It is impossible to go back in time, but it is not impossible to recover the stories about it and to recover the basic spiritual, cosmological bonds that connect us to our ancestors and to all other women. Ultimately a woman 's sense of herself as a person and a mother comes from these connections. Women nourish the new generation by bringing them into a family that includes many generations of parents to provide comfort, support, knowledge, and respect for all that was experienced and endured to create a single baby to carry us into the future. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Labor in upright supported position.( All photos in this article courtesy of the author ; photographs by Shonto Begay.) <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Birth of my daughter. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Supportive women, birthing log, and juniper branches being heated by the wood stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log and tying of sash after childbirth. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : After childbirth juniper branches are tied tightly around the mother 's waist. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Cleaning and wrapping afterbirth. <p> @#@ 3842 Reviving Indigenous Languages across North America <p> The people of the Cochiti Pueblo were moved to revitalize their language after they conducted a survey that disclosed that all of its fluent speakers were thirty-five years of age or older. The few speakers under age thirty-five were semiliterate, according to Mary Eunice Romero, a Karas( Pueblo). Romero then asked, " What is going to happen to our language in 20 years when those who are 35 years old become 55? In 20 more years, when they 're 75? "( n1) <p> The Cochiti immersion program began in 1996 with a summer program for thirty children under instruction from the Tribal Council, all instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. After that, according to Romero, the program grew quickly : " When the kids went home, they spread the news that, ' Wow, they 're not using any English. They 're not writing. It 's just totally in Cochiti. ' We started out with four teachers. The next day, we got 60 kids. By the third week, we had 90 kids. By the end of the summer, the kids were starting to speak. "( n2) Romero also watched the mode of instruction change the behavior of the children : " The behavior change was a major miracle. These kids came in rowdy as can be. By the time they left, they knew the appropriate protocol of how you enter a house, greet your elder, say good-bye. The fact that they could use verbal communication for the most important piece of culture, values, and love started a chain reaction in the community. "( n3) <p> Experiences at the Cochiti Pueblo mirror a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American languages, many of which have been verging on extinction, have enjoyed a revival in recent years largely due to many Native American nations ' adoption of " immersion " programs, which teach a language as the major part of many reservation school curricula. <p> Two books have been developed from a series of symposia on teaching Indigenous languages that have been held annually since 1994.( n4) The symposia have gathered roughly three hundred people a year at several venues around the United States. Several were held at Northern Arizona University, where they were sponsored by its Multicultural Education Program, a subdivision of the university 's Center for Excellence in Education. These two books celebrate the rediscovery of language with a sense of joy. The revival of Indigenous languages -- immersion training has become one of the hottest educational tickets in Indian Country -- is in stark contrast to the somber purge of Native languages and cultures that was delivered more than a century ago with the federal government 's historical emphasis on assimilation into English-speaking mainstream culture. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, save the man, " used by Richard Henry Pratt, who founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879. <p> Julia Kushner, one of the contributors to Revitalizing Native Languages( she describes language work among the Arikara), cites studies indicating that 90 percent of the 175 Native languages that survived General Platt 's cultural gauntlet today have no child speakers.( n5) That figure dates from the mid-1990s. Speakers mourn the continuing loss of several languages, more than a dozen of which lost their last living speakers during the first half of the 1990s alone. <p> The revival of Native languages has been a grassroots affair in many Native American communities, as immersion programs have spread across Turtle Island, from the Akwesasne Mohawk territory( which straddles the borders of New York State, Ontario, and Quebec), to the Cochiti Pueblo of New Mexico and the Native peoples of Hawaii. <p> LANGUAGE AS THE BASIS OF SOVEREIGNTY <p> Why teach language? Little Bear said that " language is the basis of sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n6) During the nineteenth century, said Little Bear, the United States showed its respect for Native American languages essential role in culture by trying to eliminate them : " We have all those attributes that comprise sovereign nations : a governance structure, law and order, jurisprudence, a literature, a land base, spiritual and sacred practice, and that one attribute that holds all of these. together : our languages. So once our languages disappear, each one of these attributes begins to fall apart until they are all gone. "( n7) Little Bear said that, for the Cheyennes, the transition to a written language occurred about a century ago. As more and more communication took place in English, " Those in my generation who speak the Cheyenne language are quite possibly the last generation able to joke in our own language. "( n8) <p> The prestige of a language and the self-esteem of its speakers may play a pivotal role in its revitalization. Navajo, for instance, was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, once deemed worthless by many Anglo-Americans, was used by the Navajo Code Talkers to confuse the Germans and Japanese in World War II. With Navajo 's validity as a real, complex, and useful language suddenly nationally acknowledged, its usage increased, and today this language again is spoken widely.( n9) <p> A CONFERENCE IN SANTA FE <p> Immersion programs had become popular enough by 1998 to sustain a wide-ranging conference, " The Critical Moment : Funding the Perpetuation of Native Languages. " The conference, held January 26-28, 1998, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was sponsored by the Lannan Foundation, which has made Native language reclamation one of its funding priorities. <p> Language immersion programs are part of a growing commitment to traditional Native education often initiated by parents and educational professionals seeking an alternative to students ' alienation and high dropout rates in federal or local public schools. Mary Eunice Romero said that her people came to language revival as they sought " to understand why our children were not being referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any other child. "( n10) <p> This quest brought Romero and her associates to a realization that the Karas concept of giftedness was quite different from the dominant standard in most non-Indian schools. These schools tended to define giftedness in terms of tests and grades, while, said Romero, to the Karas " gifts and talents. are expressed in traditional terms " and directed not toward the fame and fortune of an intelligent individual but toward the well-being of the community as a whole.( n11) To many " immersion " educators, the revival of Native languages comprises an exercise of community-based intellect. " When we talk about trying to revitalize our language, " said Romero, " it is survival of how we think, who we are, and what we truly believe our children should be. We want to pass this information down to our children in the right way, the appropriate way. "( n12) <p> The Santa Fe conference allowed participants from across the continent to share the histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to raise funds for their programs, many of which rely on a combination of federal funds( such as Head Start) and private donations. The Lannan Foundation also sought through this conference to raise the salience of Native American language revitalization for other funding organizations. <p> Janet Voorhees, executive director of the Lannan Foundation, said that Native language revitalization benefits everyone, not only the Native peoples who are maintaining and enhancing languages that serve as vehicles for traditional cultures. For non-Indians, said Voorhees, Native language revival " will result in a world that is more deeply compassionate, wise, more caring and protective of the Earth, and more beautiful for its songs, ceremonies, and prayers. "( n13) Voorhees quoted Dorothy Lazore, a teacher of immersion Mohawk at Akwesasne, describing a basic paradigm shift in how Native children view schooling : " For Native people, after so much pain and tragedy connected with their experience of school, we finally now see Native children, their teachers and their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing and being themselves in the immersion setting. "( n14) <p> WHAT IS LOST WITH LOSS OF A LANGUAGE <p> Many immersion programs were started after parents became concerned about( in the words of author Joshua Fishman) " What you lose when you lose your language. " According to Fishman, <p> The most important relationship between language and culture. is that most of the culture is expressed in the language. Take language away from the culture and you take away its greetings, its curses, its praises, its laws, its literature, its songs, riddles, proverbs, and prayers. The culture could not be expressed and handled in any other way. You are losing all those things that essentially are the way of life, the way of thought, the way of valuing the land upon which you live and the human reality that you 're talking about.( n15) <p> Fishman, a pioneer in the revitalization of Indigenous languages worldwide, has provided a theoretical structure for the revivals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others inspired by what he has written,( n16) are often cited at conferences where revival of Indigenous languages is a major subject. <p> In her opening remarks at the Santa Fe conference, Voorhees said that at least three hundred distinct Native American languages were spoken in North America at the time of Columbus 's first landfall in 1492. Today, 190 languages remain, but a great many of them are in imminent danger of being lost. Michael Kraus, former president of the Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages, was cited at the conference as having written in Stabilizing Indigenous Languages that only 20 of 175 surviving Native American languages in the United States are still being learned as a first language by children from their parents.( n17) <p> Many immersion programs have been started after middle-aged or elderly members of Native nations discovered that the use of their languages had become restricted to a few elders and would vanish as collective cultural knowledge upon their deaths. This knowledge has provided motivation in case after case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Richard Little Bear told the conference that families must retrieve their rightful position as the first teachers of Native languages. " They must talk our languages every day, everywhere, with anyone, " he said.( n18) <p> Darryl Kipp, co-director of the Piegan Institute, a language immersion program on Montana 's Blackfeet reservation, estimated that without programs to make young people fluent in Native languages, 70 percent of the Native languages that are spoken today in North America will die with the next few generations of Elders. As on many other reservations, the Blackfeet Confederacy( totaling about 40,000 people) started language immersion as a response to the failure of education provided to them by outside governments and agencies : " Out of the 17,000 that belong to my band, less than one per cent have a college education. Sixty-five per cent of the students in our schools never finish the tenth grade. "( n19) Kipp continued : <p> These are damming statistics about a Western form of education that fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our language, move forth as English-speaking people and become successful in the world, has not come true. This may never become present unless we use our Native language. When it is reintroduced to a child, this can be used as a very powerful force and source of healing. When we look at the beautiful, happy faces of the children reimmersed in their language, we begin to realize again that Native Americans have potential and possibilities.( n20) <p> Kipp said that language is too often taken for granted, like the rugged Rocky Mountains with which the Blackfeet live. " Many a day we get up and forget they are even there, " said Kipp. " In America, we tend to treat language as a strictly political issue. We never talk about the aesthetics, beauty, or many attributes that come through a diversity of languages. " When he is asked why the Blackfeet want to preserve their language, Kipp is tempted to answer, " Why do we wish to breath air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on this earth? "( n21) Language immersion instruction on Kipp 's reservation is now provided to five hundred children per year. " We have a goal, " said Piegan cofounder Dorothy Still Smoking, " that. 100 per cent of our Blackfeet children leaving Head Start will have proficient Blackfeet speaking skills "( n22) Kipp was one of several speakers at the Santa Fe conference who urged that Native languages be conceived as living, evolving communities of speech : " We look at Native languages as part of the future. We can not relegate them to the dusty bins of history of the artifact shelf of a museum, but as a living presence with ourselves. "( n23) Kauanoe Kamana, a leader in Hawaiian language revitalization, said, " We are really aggressive, especially in the area of Hawaiian word development. If a language is to be living, it has to change and move. You can not have a language that is stuck in another century "( n24) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed himself to a revival of his Native language after a discovery that the last elder speakers of it might take the language to the grave with them. Kipp came to the language after having been an English professor and a writer. <p> The first time I understood our language was in peril was in 1985, when we did a research project. We went to homes in our reserve and asked people if they spoke the language and what they did that reflected our tribalism. We found that almost all the speakers in our community were over the age of 50, and that there were no children, teenagers, 30-or-40-year olds who could speak our language. It did n't take a mathematician or prophet to determine how long our language would last.( n25) <p> After that study a group of Blackfeet, including Kipp, spent five years developing ways to teach the language. They ran into some opposition from tribal members who asserted that knowledge of the language was of little practical use. One woman asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kipp replied, " I struggled and had a hard time with that one. While I ca n't necessarily make soup, we can make healthy children, and healthy children can make all kinds of soups. "( n26) <p> Among the Comanches a language immersion program has been started that utilizes master speakers who teach entire families( who then use the language at home) at once. Several Pueblo communities, including Cochiti, Acoma, and Laguna, maintain immersion programs that take place in a ceremonial context. Hawaiian Native people have established immersion programs that span several islands. " If our language dies, if our culture dies, " he said, " We die as a people to the world.... We can not let that happen. "( n27) <p> LANGUAGE IMMERSION IN HAWAII <p> Kamana outlined the steps that led to language immersion schools in Hawaii. First, he said, a group of people decided to make the effort required to maintain a living language. Like Kipp, Kamana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he committed himself to its preservation. " Most of the teachers had to learn it as a second language, " he said.( n28) <p> Once a commitment to the language was made, a small group of people began to develop plans for organized instruction in it. " When we began, it was a belief, " said Kamana. " We did n't begin with money.... We did n't all live in the same community. We are university-level secondary-school teachers in the Hawaiian language from different islands. We decided one day that what had been happening at the university system was not enough. " " We began in 1983 with the idea, " said Kamana. " We were eating dinner one night and I said, ' Yeah, let 's do it. ' We got a non-profit licensed business and started opening schools. You ca n't do it alone. You have to do it in a group. "( n29) <p> Kamana and others in Hawaii studied as many other examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maoris of New Zealand, who have been using Elders to teach their language to young children, even babies. The Hawaiians decided to name their school " Punana Leo, " which means " Language Nest. " <p> Having assembled a core of committed people, Kamana and others then built support for language revitalization in their communities. " Our first stage was to find people. like parents who wanted it, said Kamana.( n30) Soon they had a schoolroom and a teacher. Next, they researched the best ways to teach the Native Hawaiian language to their children. The curriculum was created locally ; Kamana said that he developed the curriculum for grades 7 through 11 himself. <p> Attention to financial resources became a concern for Punana Leo 's language revivalists only after public support was evident. Money comes because you are doing a good job, Kamana believes. Once popular demand enhanced prospects for funding, the Punana Leo school became a physical reality, with buildings, materials, teachers, and curricula. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tress must be placed on producing people who utilize the language in their daily lives. <p> Kamana 's experiences were shared to some degree by Edna Viak McClean( Inupiag), who is an instructor at Ilishavilk College in Bear, Alaska. Any immersion program may fail if it lacks a core of committed people, she told the Santa Fe conference. The second biggest hurdle, she said, is the lack of educated Native language speakers who can serve as translators, curriculum developers, teachers, and advocates and people versed in the fundamentals of an immersion program who can advocate for it with the school board and funding agencies. McClean said that another common concern is the need to insure Native cultural transmission in the language schools. <p> Darlene Franco of the Native Californian Action Network said that her grandmother and grandfather were the last in her family to use Native language as a living tool in their daily lives. <p> The language started breaking down in my mother 's generation. She did n't speak English until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boarding school where the language was beaten out of her. She was far away from home. As a result, when I was growing up, my parents wanted me to speak English. They wanted me to survive in this world, but, in doing so, they did n't let us forget who we were. Ceremonies were still carried on.( n31) <p> Franco teaches at an immersion preschool, where " We have two-to six-year-old kids who are learning and speaking the language every day "( n32) <p> A small group of young people on the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indian Reservation in northeast Kansas decided to arrest the decline of Indigenous language on their reservation, despite scoffing by some there who said, " You ca n't learn to talk Potawatomi. "( n33) Eddie Joe Mitchell, a 1991 graduate of Washburn University, who has a strong background in English and journalism, was one of the early organizers and often played the role of facilitator by sounding out the words and writing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language to continue came forward to teach. Men such as Nelson Potts and Irving Shopteese were both supportive and instrumental in the early days of the class. After these two men died, Potawatomi women, such as Cecilia " Meeks " Jackson, and Albert " Shaw no queue " Wamego stepped forward to take up the slack.( n34) <p> When the class started during 1990, it had as many as fifty to sixty students in attendance at any given time. Of these original students only three have remained with the group from the beginning -- Eddie Joe Mitchell, Mary Wabnum, and Mary LeClere. The students have since accumulated 6,000 words of the language and the ability to use them in sentences. During the ensuing decade, " The influence has spread out among the community to where the usage is more prevalent today. Mostly, by every-day use by the participants, the elders and their children are now using parts of the language in daily situations. "( n35) <p> Some programs have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Winnebago), for example, has taken part in an immersion program that draws students from a reservation that spans fourteen counties, about two hundred miles from one end to the other. The program, with twenty to thirty-two teachers at any given time, also provides immersion language education in some urban areas with large numbers of Ho-chunk people, including Chicago, the Twin Cities, and Madison, Wisconsin. <p> NATIVE LANGUAGE AS AN AID TO LEARNING ENGLISH <p> Bill Wilson of the Punana Leo school said that the word " immersion " does not wholly cover what goes on in these new language schools. " We are not talking just about immersion. We are talking about going to school in a Native language, if you 're a Native speaker or not. In Hawaii, we have one community that has all Native speakers "( n36) <p> Wilson said that children who are immersed in their Native language also tend to do well at learning English as it is introduced. " One of our immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one hour of English a day starting in the fifth grade. " Learning English is not difficult for immersion students, said Wilson, because they are submerged in it as soon as they leave school. At school, instruction is half in Hawaiian and half in English. Students in immersion school " reach parity with non-immersion students in reading comprehension, vocabulary, and grammatical knowledge, " said Wilson. " They have not lost anything, " he said, " and they have gained a language. "( n37) Hawaiian immersion teachers told a U.S. Senate hearing in 2003 that their students have an 85 percent acceptance rate at colleges and universities.( n38) <p> In some cases, language revitalization becomes part of general community life, as at Akwesasne, where the weekly community newspaper, Indian Time, carries regular Mohawk language lessons by Mary Arquette that cover everyday situations, such as weather : " Teioweratashne, It was a windstorm ; Ionen'onkin:ne, it was hailing. " A quarter of the Mohawks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The emphasis on language revival is arriving barely in time for some Native American languages, those which have reached stage eight of Joshua A. Fishman 's eight stages of language loss ; in this stage only a few Elders speak the language that once served an entire people at home and in their working lives.( n39) <p> The two books developed from the immersion program symposia present concrete, tested strategies for preserving Native languages as living tools of culture in daily life, not as museum pieces of a presumably also-dead culture.( n40) Fishman 's landmark book, Reversing Language Shift : Theoretical and Empirical Foundations of Assistance to Threatened Languages, is cited throughout these two volumes. The reach of language revivals described in these books is worldwide ; lessons and examples are freely borrowed from the Maori of New Zealand, who have had an active language revival program for several decades. The New Zealand government has maintained a Maori Language Commission since 1987. These two books also describe Native peoples ' efforts to revive their languages in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirits, " a poem by Little Bear that appears at the beginning of Revitalizing Native Languages, reveals a sense that revival of Native American languages closes a historical and cultural circle : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In Revitalizing Native Languages, editor Jon Reyhner stresses the need to use a revitalized language as a living tool to teach academic subjects rather than as a second language. The language must be restored to its place in the everyday life of a people, he believes. This belief is widely shared. <p> SHOULD NATIVE LANGUAGE BE WRITTEN, OR SOLELY ORAL? <p> Reyhner 's two books present a balanced summary of a subject that causes controversy in Native language revitalization studies : should the revived language be written, or solely oral? Some language activists point out that many Native languages were first committed to writing by missionaries seeking, as Reyhner writes, " to translate their Bible and convert Natives from their traditional religions. "( n42) These two volumes present a wide range of programs that have evolved locally, some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs, and others that have grown out of the same type of programs. While some of the programs strive to maintain an emphasis on spoken language to the exclusion of written communication, others emphasize production of written sources to be revived in the Native language as well as in English. Some of the programs use computers extensively, while others avoid them as a culturally inappropriate intrusion. <p> Fishman himself comes down squarely on the side of literacy : " Unless they are entirely withdrawn from the modern world, minority ethno-linguistic groups need to be literate in their mother tongue( as well as in some language of wider communication), " he asserts.( n43) The often-disputed distinction between oral and literate language may be culturally artificial because many Native American cultures possessed forms of written communication, even if many European immigrants did not recognize them as such. From the wampum belts of the Haudenosaunee( Iroquois), to the illustrated codices of the Aztecs and Maya, to the winter counts of the Plains, written communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Russell Bernard as he urges Native Americans to establish publishing houses.( n44) <p> LANGUAGE REVIVAL AND MUSIC <p> Language revival also is being used in some cases to encourage the expression of Native oral histories, in written and spoken forms, as well as to enhance and preserve musical expression. Some teachers of language are finding that music is an amazingly effective way to introduce young students to music and cultural heritage. " Why music? " asks Amar Almasude, who writes about language revival in Northern Africa : <p> It is perhaps the best vehicle for becoming acquainted with humans. It is the expression that is the most pervasive. In songs, human society is portrayed and everyday experiences are reflected. Their themes are usually social issues and historical events, including national and religious feasts and holidays.... Thus, music is a fundamental element in human life.( n45) <p> Reyhner 's books present precise descriptions and examples from teachers who have been involved in a wide variety of language revival programs, from several Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Arapaho, and Navajo. While describing individual programs, these books also sketch the common pedagogical essentials basic to all language revitalization efforts. <p> Reyhner suggests use of the 3 Ms of language revitalization : methods, materials, and motivation : <p> Methods deal with what teaching techniques will be used at what age levels and stages of language loss. Materials deal with what things will be available for teachers and learners to use, including audiotapes, videotapes, storybooks, dictionaries, grammars, textbooks, and computer software. Motivation deals with increasing the prestige( including giving recognition and awards to individuals and groups who make special efforts) and usefulness of the indigenous language in the community, and using teaching methods that learners enjoy, so they will come back for more indigenous language instruction.( n46) <p> Language must become a familiar part of a student 's life ; immersion specialists believe that 600 to 700 hours of such contact is necessary to acquire the kind of fluency that allows for transmission of culture from generation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguistic innovation, describing how Native languages are being revitalized using both traditional methods and modern technology to extend the reach of oral cultures. In Mexico traditional Aztec Danza( dance) is being used to teach classical Nahuatl. The dances are part of an eighteen-ceremony ecological calendar, so while learning the language, students also absorb some knowledge of Aztec history and culture. These ceremonies deal with rain, germination, ripening of corn, war victory, hunting, and the tribal dead, comment authors of a study on revernacularizing classical Nahuatl through Aztec dance. The authors list the intertwined benefits of this approach, by which students acquire not only knowledge of language, but also, " Nahua Aztec history from an indigenous perspective, a deeper understanding of Danza steps, creation myths, and the making and playing of indigenous musical instruments. "( n47) <p> In Alaska a number of Deg Hit'an( Ingalik Athabasken) people have been teaching each other their language, Deg Xinag, over the telephone, using conference calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a space to practice their skills and to teach each other new phrases and words. Phone conferences are hardly immersion( since the calls last only an hour a week), but language is being taught. Callers have joined the conversations from as far away a Seattle. <p> In a similar vein, KTNN AM 660, the Navajo Nation 's official radio station, has been making plans to offer instruction in the Navajo language over the air in an attempt to follow Joshua Fishman 's advice that revitalized languages, to be successful, must be shared by a people via the communications media of their communities. " The Voice of the Navajo Nation, " as KTNN is called, has a signal that reaches from Albuquerque to Phoenix. <p> The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas( SSILA ; see http : //www.ssila.org /) was founded in December 1981 as an international scholarly organization representing American Indian linguistics. The society has approximately nine hundred members, more than a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive listing of articles on American Indian languages in more than one hundred journals( 1988 to the present). The group also maintains an index of abstracts for more than two hundred dissertations and theses on American Indian languages and related topics, also a forum for a wide range of ideas. General Pratt would certainly be surprised at how completely his set of educational assumptions have been turned on their heads, now that educators are no longer( as Pratt once proudly announced as an advertising slogan for his boarding schools) " killing the Indian to save the man. " <p> A measure that might have General Pratt turning over in his grave has been advanced by advocates of language immersion schools : federal funding, just as boarding schools were funded a century and more ago. The idea has been advanced before the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs but not yet passed out of committee. University of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs during May 2003 in support of S. 575, a bill that would give long-term funding to Native American language " survival schools, " another name for immersion programs. These are languages that exist no place else in the world, Hinton said. They 're a part of what makes America America. "( n48) Of 85 Indigenous languages in California, 35 have no speakers and the remaining 50 are spoken by only a few Elders, Hinton said. " We 've found that teaching the kids everything in their native language is the most effective way of doing it, " Hinton said. " If people are n't learning the language at home, they 've got to learn somewhere, and school is the next best thing. "( n49) <p> Native communities that have too few speakers remaining to staff an entire immersion program may establish a " master-apprentice learning program, " where a single teacher is assigned to a student. Through such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language to eventually form the core of an immersion program. Hinton hosts a biennial conference called " Breath of Life " at the University of California at Berkeley to help revive Native American languages with no living speakers. Languages with no living speakers sometimes can be revived, at least in part, from documents. " We have sound archives and paper archives on campus, " Hinton said. " We invite California Indians to come learn how to use their languages. "( n50) <p> One wonders what General Pratt would think of the joy with which Native peoples across North America are recovering their languages a century after his boarding schools prohibited the speaking of them and did it, so he said, for Native peoples ' own good. Pratt and other reformers of that era thought they were doing Native peoples a favor, that their policies were a humane alternative to outright extermination. Left unsaid a century ago was a third option -- that a rich quilt of diverse Native languages would be preserved and cultivated. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing their last speakers, that is what we are seeing today. <p> The language revival movement has become strong enough to sustain a festival called " Native Nations, Native Voices " to honor contemporary Native language writers. Native language writers are being invited to participate in a three-day festival sponsored by the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center of Albuquerque. Writers will read from their works in their Indigenous languages. A special effort has been made to include and honor high school and college authors in Native languages. As of this writing, the festival is being scheduled for July of 2005. <p>
