4071041 Last month 's issue described the printing process in the Windows operating system. In this column, the discussion will be repeated as it applies to the Mac operating system. <p> The preliminaries are finally complete and it 's time to make a print. The color corrected RGB image has been resized for the desired print, and has been sharpened( Figure 1). In addition, it has been proofed to the planned paper/ink/ printer that will be used, and a rendering intent selected. <p> One caveat before going any further... the screen captures in this column are for Epson printers. Accordingly, they will differ from those for an HP or Canon printer. Pretty much the same functionality exists on those systems, but it will probably be necessary to do a little hunting to find the relevant " switches. " <p> Start the process with the command File>Print( Figure 2). Begin by checking the drop down box at the top center of this large dialog to see that the correct printer has been selected. The next go to is the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialog. Recall there are two ways to print : one can let Photoshop manage the printing process OR one can let the Printer driver do that job. This means that one method must be turned ON. It also means the other must be turned OFF, Falling to turn the other system OFF, results in BOTH trying to manage the process and invariably produces a terrible result( print). This is the most common problem users have with the printing process! <p> Most recommend using Photoshop to manage the process, and that option has been selected in Figure 2. Printer color management will be turned off later, on one of the printer driver screens. With Photoshop managing the process, one must also select the appropriate profile to be used. Here an Epson supplied profile has been selected for the Enhanced Matte paper. Relative Colorimetric Rendering Intent has been selected because there are few out-of-gamut colors. Black Point Compensation has been turned ON. <p> In the center of Figure 2 there are two large boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Size. Position allows one to place the image at any desired location on the paper. With Center Image unchecked, drag the image to the desired location. In Figure 2, Center Image has been checked which positions the image at the center of the sheet. The preferred procedure is to resize the image to the desired print size in Photoshop ; however the Scaled Print Size section of this dialog is another option, in particular, selecting the Scale to Fit Media is a good choice when the objective is a preliminary test print. <p> The next step is to select the Page Setup option on Figure 2. This opens the dialog shown in Figure 3 for an Epson 4000 ; other Epson printers may have slightly different dialog, but the information content of these screens is similar. Use this dialog to select Paper Size, Orientation and to confirm the correct printer has been selected. Notice that Orientation and Scaling are redundant to what 's included in Figure 2. This is because one is created specifically for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other is created for Photoshop by Adobe. The redundancy is a consequence of the very large number of makes and models of printers used with Photoshop. Clicking OK here takes one back to Figure 2. <p> It 's a good idea to reconfirm all of the settings on Figure 2 before pressing Print. Print takes one to a series of printer driver screens ; two of these are critical to print quality. Use the drop down box to navigate amongst the screens. On the Printer Color Management screen( Figure 4), turn printer color management OFF. The box says ' Off( No Color Adjustment) ', but this is a Printer screen, so what it really means is no color management from the printer driver, Having chosen OFF here, and having previously turned Photoshop Manages Colors ON( see Figure 2), accomplishes the " one ON other OFF ' requirement mentioned in the second paragraph of this column. Finally, on the Print Settings screen( Figure 5) : enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to make the printer profile. Clicking Print on this( or any other of the seven screens) initiates the printing process. <p> While this entire process may seem unduly complicated, keep in mind that it involves an interaction between software( Photoshop and the printer driver) and hardware( the printer itself). Furthermore, there are a very large number of printers that could be involved, only some of which are inkjet type. Like most such processes, you learn by doing and with a little experience this process too will become both better understood and intuitive. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 1 : This is the image to be printed. It has been resized to print on 13x79? paper. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 2 is the File>Print screen for the Mac. The marked boxes are of special importance and the recommended settings are described in the text. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 3 is the Page Setup screen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 4 : this is the Printer Color Management dialog for the Mac, and should be turned OFF. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 5 : this is the Print Settings dialog for the Mac. These settings should duplicate the settings used to make the printer profile. <p> By Fred Drury, Wheaton, IL <p>
