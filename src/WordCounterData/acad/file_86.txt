4012541 Sigurd Ibsen and Ringeren, 1898-1899 <p> ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 1, 1898, the first issue of Ringeren, a weekly magazine about contemporary politics, culture, and criticism appeared in Kristiania. The magazine 's name was chosen, according to its founder and editor, Sigurd Ibsen, the son of playwright Henrik Ibsen, " because the weekly 's purpose was to wake up and admonish, to toll the bell for all contemporary questions, both at home and abroad, which call for our common attention. "( n1) Any relevant social question would be considered for publication, according to Ibsen, but Ringeren also included a wide range of essays on European and American literature.( n2) As the son of Henrik Ibsen, Sigurd believed social and political ideas were essential elements of literature. Their inclusion, therefore, appears to have been a natural extension of this Ibsen world view. In addition to its specific content, Ibsen recognized the magazine would have broader appeal with contributions from well known and respected writers in Norway. Having established contacts with the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also through his own work, Ibsen contacted more than forty persons including Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Knut Hamsun, Fridtjof Nansen, Ernst Sars, and Arne Garborg, among others, to invite them to contribute to the publication. When a trial issue was published on November 27, 1897, Ibsen 's original list of forty-two names had grown to sixty-six.( n3) If subscribers could be enticed by the formidable array of talent, Ringeren might not only be a significant financial success, but an influential organ in the political debate which Ibsen himself had been leading against the Union with Sweden. With the profile Ibsen gave it and the essays he contributed to it, Ringeren, in fact, would represent a decisive moment in the Norwegian debate over the dissolution of the union with Sweden, a union which Norwegians had come to doubt if not outrightly resent. But more than a political publication, Ibsen envisioned Ringeren contributing to the cultural enlightenment of Norwegians as well. <p> As promising as its initial issues were, however, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it glowed brightly but only briefly. Its most important months were during 1898 when Ibsen served as the editor. Carl Naerup, a prolific literary critic and friend of Ibsen, kept it alive through 1899, but he was unable to provide the lively political resonance it possessed under Ibsen himself. <p> Although no readers ' poll is available for Ringeren, many reasons led to its demise. How could this magazine, which Norwegian historian Wilhelm Kielhau once wrote, " had reached a level which no Norwegian weekly has achieved before or since ; ' become so quickly irrelevant?( n4) What kind of publication was Ringeren, and what role did Ibsen play in its initial success and ultimate failure? In many ways, Ringeren, can not be separated from its founder. Sigurd Ibsen conceived it, he nourished it by giving it a distinct profile, and it died when he abandoned it. <p> Sigurd Ibsen was born in Christiania in 1959 and named after the hero in his father 's most recent play, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway when his father left the country in 1864, Sigurd grew up and was educated on the continent, completing gymnasium in Munich and taking a doctorate in law in Rome in 1882 before his twenty-third birthday. Although frequent trips to Norway with his mother gave him an understanding and an appreciation for the land of his birth, his father 's oftstated hostility and bitterness toward Norway in addition to his own subsequent disappointments led him in 1883 to consider entering the Italian foreign service. Only the intervention of his father to secure him a stipend combined with the positive impression he made on the new prime minister, Johan Sverdrup, in 1884 led to his appointment to the Consulate Office of the Department of the Interior. In March, 1885, he was given an attache position with the Swedish-Norwegian foreign service.( n5) <p> Following a brief posting in Stockholm, he was sent to Washington, Dc where he spent two formative years. While in America, he refused to write his reports in Swedish as required choosing instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gained first-hand experience with the Swedish attitude of superiority toward Norway. The unwillingness of Swedish foreign office officials to acknowledge Norway as Sweden 's equal in the Union the young Ibsen took as a personal affront. His outspoken views on the matter resulted in his Swedish colleagues coming to perceive him as a " radical " and they were given orders not to talk politics with him. <p> During Ibsen 's tenure in America, seen largely through numerous personal letters to his parents, he developed a growing sensitivity to questions of fairness and equality and an awareness of being a European. But more importantly, Ibsen 's American experience awakened in him a latent sense of being a Norwegian. When he left America in i888, although posted to Vienna, it was only a matter of time before he would settle in Norway. <p> Growing increasingly irritated by the attitudes he confronted daily, Ibsen resigned from the foreign service in 1890. His father, though initially believing Sigurd 's action to be " a catastrophe, " came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Subsequently, in a series of newspaper articles in Dagbladet, Sigurd attacked both the foreign service and its diplomats. His public stance brought criticism but also support, most notably from the family friend Bjornstjerne Bjornson. In his reply to Bjornson 's initial letter of support, Ibsen told his future father-in-law that he had been a great influence on his sense of national honor. Ibsen further noted that he had only begun to attack the existing structure of the joint Swedish-Norwegian foreign office : " In the time I have spent in the diplomatic service, I have developed an all too strong consciousness of the absurdity and the unfairness of present conditions that I feel it my duty to oppose the existing system. "( n7) Continuing his attacks in subsequent articles, Ibsen 's criticism extended to his fellow Norwegians as well for what he called their " sins of negligence ; ' " laziness, " and " cowardly incompetence " which had characterized Norwegian Union politics.( n8) <p> Clearly radicalized by his foreign service experiences, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomats to take the initiative in its conflict with Sweden. He also believed that the broader public was, to a great extent, uninformed and lacked sufficient understanding of the true nature of the Union with Sweden. To provide information and create a better understanding, Ibsen published Unionen, a 195-page overview of the history of the Union since 1814 and a theoretical foundation for a policy aimed at establishing a separate Norwegian foreign office organized by Norwegian initiative. " There are two ways such a proactive stance can happen, " he wrote. " Norway... can either take matters into her own hands or enter into negotiations. "( n9) Negotiations, however, required mutual respect and an assumption of equality between the negotiators. Based on his own experiences in the foreign service, he concluded that such assumptions and respect did not exist : <p>( Norway has grown in population, welfare, and enlightenment. It does not matter. Among seafaring nations, she has achieved foremost status. It does not matter. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe are almost exclusively Norwegian. It does not matter. However far Norwegians have come, their kinsmen in Sweden only see a Scandinavian of so to say second class. One needs only to have lived in Sweden or have been associated with influential Swedes -- and I speak here from personal experience -- to understand how deeply held is the attitude that Norway is fundamentally a nation of simpletons.( n10)) <p> Ibsen believed that because of these attitudes and Sweden 's unwillingness to negotiate, Norway had to act unilaterally in order to establish a separate foreign office including a separate consular service. Encouraged by Ibsen 's arguments, Venstre The Liberal Party adopted his slogan of unilateral action in the 1891 elections.( n11) <p> The more aggressive policy followed after 1891 bore no fruit, however, and, in 1895, Norwegians were forced to withdraw their claims for unilateral action and accept new negotiations or face possible Swedish military action. Ibsen pointed to the lack of political unity in Norway as contributing to the continuing crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian action, an aggressive policy would remain a party, not a national, position. In a letter to Bjornson on March 4, 1895, Ibsen pointed out that, in reality, the Union crisis was not Norway against Sweden, but Venstre against Sweden and Hoyre. Although new political alignments and new policies were inevitable, Ibsen believed, only by uniting behind a single policy could the Gordian knot be cut.( n12) <p> In late 1895, Ibsen set aside his anti-Union rhetoric to prepare a series of lectures on sociology in support of a professorship the Storting was planning to establish at the University in Oslo.( n13) Although the lectures were well attended and argued convincingly for the chair in sociology, the evaluation committee rejected Ibsen as " not qualified. " In reality, sociology as a discipline was probably being rejected rather than Ibsen himself : forty years lapsed before a position in sociology was established at the University. Ibsen, however, took the rejection personally. Again, he considered leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large German or Italian newspaper.( n14) Friends lobbied to have another professorship earmarked for him, but he rejected their suggestions. <p> Mentally and physically exhausted by what he perceived as humiliating treatment, Ibsen spent the summer of 1897 in Italy. When his wife, Bergliot, joined him in Monsummano, she found him to be depressed and having difficulty eating and sleeping. Family and friends closed ranks around him by publicly protesting the committee 's decision. Christen Collin, a friend and literary critic, published a vigorous defense in Verdens Gang, while Henrik Ibsen notified the University that he would never set foot in its buildings again.( n15) Bjornson encouraged Sigurd to consider running for parliament, a suggestion he found flattering, but subsequently rejected believing he had nothing in common with Norwegian politicians or their constituency.( n16) If active politics were not the answer, Ibsen obviously believed nonetheless that he could still make some kind of contribution because he had so much to say. <p> In the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibsen returned to the Union question, the one area where he had received positive response from his countrymen. He reworked some earlier essays and developed new ones, with the intention of publishing them in a new magazine he had envisioned-Ringeren. To Bergliot, he wrote that he was working on some articles, in spite of being " full of scorn and hate. "( n17) Bergliot Ibsen wrote to a friend just before Ringeren appeared that Sigurd was " beginning a new magazine which interests him a great deal. He has had such a hard time, but now we hope things will be better. "( n18) <p> Focusing on Ringeren, Ibsen could avoid thinking of the personal attacks and how unfairly he believed he had been treated. He sent letters of invitation to scores of cultural personalities and received commitments from most. To Bjornson, he noted the importance of a contribution in the first issue : "... a column from your hand will exercise great influence and gain us more subscribers than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Ibsen, needing to be mindful of the economics of the venture, focused on the business side of Ringeren, the opportunity to disseminate his views was more important for him. Paying subscribers were important, to be sure, but they were also readers, readers who could be informed and influenced. In addition to Bjornson, Ibsen listed J. Ernst Sars, Norway 's national historian, as collaborator, while he assumed the title of editor. <p> Bjornson and Sars had each achieved a public prominence that had elevated them to the level of Norwegian cultural icons by x898. Bjornson with his novels and poetry had achieved a national status that probably outranked Sigurd 's own father. He swirled across the cultural landscape like a tornado. Sars, the ideologue of the Liberal Party had, with his history, Udsigt over den norske historie, shaped the identity of a generation and articulated Norway 's historical development. Each was a dominating presence in the cultural landscape of the country. <p> As editor of Ringeren, Ibsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphorical fables with political overtones. One article, a sketch of German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, pointed to Ibsen 's interest in general European political affairs, but more significantly, to his fascination with individual personalities as driving forces in history.( n20) Eight of his articles, however, dealt with the Swedish-Norwegian Union. As such, they represented, in effect, a continuation of his earlier writings, particularly in his renewed criticism of Swedish attitudes and the denial of Norwegian equality. Ibsen 's lead article in the first issue, a portrait of Sweden 's conservative prime minister Erik Gustaf Bostrom, pointed to the conflict between Norway and Sweden as more than a political issue ; it was, he wrote, " a cultural struggle " kulturkamp.( n21) <p> In an article three weeks later, Ibsen returned to the predominant theme of equality, a theme he had first articulated in his letters to his parents from America and which had come to frame his overall perception of the Union with Sweden : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Swedes will not admit and can not understand. And it can hardly be otherwise for a people who, in a manner of speaking, have gone from hand to hand, from guardian to guardian ; who struggled behind a little country for four hundred years only to struggle behind another little country for some eighty years -- no, Norwegians certainly get what they deserve when they are viewed and treated as second-class Scandinavians by their kinsmen.( n22)) <p> If Ibsen 's criticism that his fellow Norwegians deserve to be treated as second-class citizens struck a discordant note, it was not reflected in Ringeren 's initial sales figures. By mid-March, 1898, the magazine was selling 5,700 copies weekly, with the likelihood that it would surpass 6,000 by April. Whether it was meant as flattery or he really believed it, Ibsen told Bjornson that his contributions had been the decisive factor : " The honor for this result, which we can really call magnificent considering our population ratio, belongs first and foremost to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hurt sales that Ibsen continued his attack on the Union, but he had also come to realize that insisting on unilateral Norwegian action without a specific program was, in the long run, futile. Calls for a separate foreign office had led only to Swedish intransigence and had failed to gain support among Norwegian conservatives. Having recognized the need for a united front as early as 1891, Ibsen was finally able in 1898 to develop an issue he believed would achieve those results -- a separate Norwegian monarchy : <p>( A separate monarchy is a better platform than a separate foreign office ; it will, in time, unite both conservative and liberal, and it will also, perhaps, secure us moral( and perhaps material) support from powers which have remained passive because Sweden has convinced them that we are a band of revolutionaries, who seek to obliterate the institution of monarchy.( n24)) <p> Two weeks after sharing this view with Bjornson, Ibsen 's article " Nationalt kongedomme " National Monarchy appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever wrote and perhaps the most significant article to appear in Ringeren during its two year existence, the publication of " Nationalt kongedomme " changed the dynamics of the entire debate over the Union. In it, Ibsen provided a theoretical basis for dissolving the Union by defining a policy to unify conflicting political interests domestically while mollifying the fears of the European powers that Norway would take the radical step of becoming a republic. <p> In his essay, Ibsen examined the changing role of monarchy through the nineteenth century. From a nadir of popularity in 1848-50, it had rebounded by the 1890s to be the most popular form of government in Europe, Ibsen claimed. Monarchy, he argued, had adjusted to constitutional parliamentary developments and was identified with the historical roots of the nation. <p> In Norway, the idea of a monarchy was attacked by liberals, radicals, and republicans alike because it was seen as Swedish. If the monarchy were national, Ibsen believed, republicanism might not disappear, but it would be severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestically because it would mean the continuation of the present regime. The sovereigns of Europe would look favorably on Norway as an independent nation, if a monarchy were retained, because the country would remain a member of the " princely trade union. "( n25) Liberals, he believed, would accept it because it would be " our Norwegian royal house. "( n26) <p> Ibsen 's proposal suggested that in the spirit of cooperation between Sweden and Norway, the Union monarch( Oscar II) should abdicate as king of Norway. In his place, his younger son, Prince Karl Bernadotte should assume the throne thereby giving the Norwegians their own national monarch and, in Ibsen 's words, make possible " a peaceful divorce with no bitterness. "( n27) <p> Like seeds scattered into the wind, Ibsen 's ideas fell on both fertile and sterile soil. A writer in Dagbladet noted a month later that he had " found strong support in the Liberal press throughout the country, " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibsen himself expressed his disappointment that his proposal had created neither sympathy nor indignation. Some seeds, however, are carried far by the wind and, in this case, seven years passed before Christian Michelsen revived Ibsen 's ideas that eventually dissolved the Union in 1905. <p> The lack of immediate response to his essay gnawed at Ibsen who, by the end of May, had resigned himself to being ignored. He had, by then, also been approached as the possible head of the new commerce and consulate office in the Department of Interior but believed this prospect would end as had the professorship two years earlier. As for Ringeren, Ibsen had published what he had been burning to say on the Union issue, and the anger he had felt when he conceived the magazine had subsided. Consequently, the publication was beginning to lose its appeal : " To edit Ringeren may be alright for a time, but in the long nm it will not satisfy me. I think and hope that I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he wrote to Bjornson on May 1.( n29) By the end of May, his frustration was growing and he only sought " to escape from it all. "( n30) It is apparent that the things Ibsen had been intent on saying a year earlier had now been said, but without the response that he had imagined. Merely publishing Ringeren, in spite of the distinction Ibsen brought to it, was never his ultimate goal ; his purpose, in fact, had been to use it as a tool for disseminating his ideas. If these ideas, which also included enlightening Norwegians about the broader cultural impulses outside Norway, were perceived to find little support, perhaps a new medium and a new forum was warranted. As a result, Ibsen grew increasingly anxious to leave Ringeren and the editorial duties associated with it. Although there had been some discussion of a government position, he had received no offer. Consequently the September 24 issue announced that, effective October 1, Ibsen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fischer and Sten Konow would assume the editorial duties. Fischer and Konow were also editing a massive volume to be published by the Norwegian government for the Paris World Exhibition in 1900, but they would complete the year.( n31) In January, 1899, Carl Naerup, the literary critic for Verdens Gang, assumed the duties of editor ; although Ibsen continued to be listed as co-editor, he had effectively ended his connection with Ringeren October 1, 1898. <p> During his tenure with Ringeren, Ibsen used the magazine not only to present his own views, but also to provide a forum for a variety of ideas which he believed would bring Norwegian culture into a broader European context and, perhaps, raise the international status of Norway. Each issue opened with a biographical essay about a featured personality -- a politician, writer, scientist, philosopher, or inventor. Essays on cultural issues appeared regularly as well as commentaries and pieces of short fiction. Edgar Allen Poe 's Telltale Heart was published in a translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running series of articles were those by the anthropologist and theoretician Andreas M. Hansen under the title " Norsk folkepsykologi " Psychology of the Norwegian People. In twelve installments, Hansen analyzed the racial characteristics of the Norwegians and associated these characteristics with their political behavior. Longskulled Norwegians, he claimed, represented progress, were supporters of the Liberal Party, and tended to be republicans. The short-skulled Norwegians, whom he associated with Slavs and most representative of western and rural Norway, he claimed were conservative and tended to be supporters of monarchy. Seeing skull size along with skin and eye color as determining factors in political affiliation, Hansen claimed that by expanding the suffrage, Norway would strengthen the conservative element because most of the disenfranchised Norwegians were short-skulled. In Hansen 's pseudo-scientific world, race determined class and political allegiance.( n33) <p> There is no evidence that Ibsen himself subscribed to Hansen 's racist theories ; quite the contrary, he demonstrated repeatedly in his personal correspondence, such as his letters from America, that politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in fact, his aversion to American racial laws in the 1880s that were the initial impetus to his emphasis on equality as the prerequisite for understanding between Norway and Sweden in the Union debate. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, eugenics was a widely accepted course of scientific investigations which based its authority on Darwinian principles. When Hansen 's articles were introduced in Ringeren, Ibsen provided a brief editorial note which simply called them " a series of highly interesting contributions to the understanding of our national character and their effect on social, political and religious life, "( n34) By publishing Hansen 's study, Ibsen was, in fact, demonstrating his personal interest in questions involving Norwegian national character and identity, matters he was still struggling intensely to understand. <p> Three weeks after Hansen 's first article appeared, Ibsen also published a critical response from a reader, Lars A. Havstad. Admitting that Hansen 's theory may have some merit, Havstad, however, noted that Norwegian history, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people representing progressive elements in Norway. He noted the preponderance of western and southwestern Norwegians in the independence movement in 1814 and in the radical politics of Ole Gabriel Ueland and Johan Sverdrup in the 1860s and 1870s as examples.( n35) <p> For Ibsen, Hansen 's ideas, and the criticism of them, were undoubtedly presented in the same spirit with which he introduced European cultural personalities and ideas to the Norwegian public : in order to enlighten and to stimulate, as well as to " wake up and admonish. " <p> Ringeren 's purpose, it can be said, was also the theme in Ibsen 's own production. Like the magazine he founded, he sought to " wake up and admonish. " Through the years of active public life, he focused on Union issues primarily, straying only in an attempt to establish a chair in sociology at the University. Like his father 's dramas, Sigurd Ibsen argued that contemporary ideas and impulses had an organic existence in society and needed to be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect his times while also shaping the debate. But, being an Ibsen and growing up with an extremely sensitive father as a role model, Sigurd, like his father, was quick to take umbrage at what he perceived as unfairness or criticism. It was this attitude which brought him into public life and it determined his behavior in it. To Sigurd, criticism was always personal. Having grown up on the continent, he had no childhood friends in Norway. Beneficial as this might be in some ways, it also hindered him. He had not been socialized with his peers, but rather within his own immediate family. He was an outsider without allies, and as such, quickly withdrew from any fight. As an outsider, he was tolerated in Norway, but only as long as his cosmopolitan views supported national interests. Like Sigurd Ibsen, as long as Ringeren contributed to the national debate, it too found support. When Ibsen left because he had personally lost the " fire in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, political edge. In spite of retaining a high intellectual level, Ringeren, like its editor, became irrelevant because it was not Norwegian enough. <p> At the turn of the century, Norwegian culture itself was being redefined, not within a cosmopolitan context with which Sigurd Ibsen would feel comfortable, but within a more narrow national framework. Fridtjof Nansen, Moltke Moe, Erik Werenskiold, Gerhard Munthe, and Nordahl Rolfsen were teaching Norwegians that their culture was narrowly synonymous with Norwegian, not European, symbols. In spite of what Sigurd Ibsen might say, Europeans like Bismarck, Theodor Mommsen, Herbert Spencer, or Gabriele d'Annunzio were important to know about, but they were not the pillars on which most Norwegians sought to build their society. Although Ringeren may have succumbed in 1899 because it lacked a nationalistic edge, its echos reverberated in the policies of Christian Michelsen when the Union was dissolved less than six years later.
