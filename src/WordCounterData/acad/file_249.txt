4170341 # Introduction # This review addresses established and emerging glycan biomarkers for detection, prognosis and novel therapeutic strategies against gastric and colorectal carcinomas. These are among the most prevalent and deadliest gastrointestinal tract malignancies in western populations 1, mostly due to late diagnosis, rapid metastatic spread and scarce efficient therapeutics 2-4. In fact, current treatments rely essentially on surgery associated with( neo) adjuvant chemotherapy, which is highly toxic and provides only modest results for advanced stage patients 2,5-7. Over the past ten years the introduction of targeted therapeutics and immunotherapy has allowed significant, but yet insufficient, improvements in disease management 8-10. As the oncology field moves toward precision medicine and patient-tailored therapeutic solutions, it becomes imperative to accomplish a more integrative and in-depth overview of the molecular nature of tumors 11-13. # Alterations in protein glycosylation are among the main molecular events accompanying oncogenic transformations in the gastric and colorectal tracts 14-16. In fact, protein glycosylation is one of the most frequent, complex and plastic posttranslational modifications of membrane-bound and secreted proteins 17. Glycans play a key role in protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cell functions, such as cell adhesion, migration and signaling, as well as modulate immune recognition and host-pathogen interactions 16,18-20. Protein glycosylation results from the highly coordinated action of nucleotide sugar transporters and sugar biosynthesis pathways, involving glycosyltransferases( GTs) and glycosidases in the endoplasmatic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. As such, several factors may influence glycan biosynthesis, namely, the under or overexpression of glycosyltransferases, the impairment of glycosyltransferase chaperone function, altered glycosidase activity, changes in the tertiary conformation of a given peptide or growing glycan, and the availability of sugar nucleotide donors, cofactors and acceptor substrates 21,22. The mislocalization of glycosyltranferases throughout the secreting organelles also contributes to significant alterations in cancer-associated protein glycosylation patterns 23-25. Two main classes of glycans can be found at cell-surface glycoproteins : i) O-glycans, being the most common O-glycan that is initiated in the Golgi by the attachment of a GalNAc residue to the hydroxyl groups of serine( Ser) or threonine( Thr) amino acids of a given polypeptide chain( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-glycosylation) 26 ; and ii) N-glycans, whose biosynthesis initiates in the endoplasmatic reticulum by the addition of an oligosaccharide chain to an asparagine( Asn) residue within consensus peptide sequences of Asn-X-Ser/Thr( X denotes any amino acid except proline) 27. Less abundant forms of protein glycosylation include O-Fucosylation, O-GlucNAcylation, and O-Mannosylation 16. Protein glycan chains are often branched or elongated and may present sialic acids, Lewis blood group related antigens or ABO(H) blood group determinants as terminal structures 28. Other modifications may include phosphorylation, O-acetylation of sialic acids and O-sulfation of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine residues, thereby increasing the structural complexity of the glycophenotype 29. In addition, protein glycosylation patterns do not follow a predefined template, as they are regulated by several factors at the cell and tissue levels, promptly responding to physiological and pathological changes 16. # Given its key functional and biological role, alterations in protein glycosylation underlying oncogenic transformations decisively contribute to the development of more malignant characteristics, such as cell-cell adhesion impairment, enhanced migration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been also implicated in the activation of intracellular oncogenic pathways and immune escape, thereby favoring cancer-tolerogenic immune responses 33,34. Particularly, advanced stage tumors often overexpress or promote the de novo biosynthesis of immature and truncated O-glycans, such as the Tn, sialyl-Tn( STn), T and sialyl-T( ST) antigens, due to a premature stop of the extension of O-glycosylation 35-37. Oversialylation and fucosylation of glycan chains are also frequently observed in cancer, including terminal antigens like the sialyl-LeA( SLeA) and sialyl-LeX( SLeX) 38-40. Contrasting with the tumor, these structures are often absent or just moderately expressed in the corresponding healthy tissues, holding potential for selective targeted therapeutics 38. In addition, many of the proteins carrying cancer-associated glycans may also be shed into the bloodstream or other bodily fluids, facilitating non-invasive detection methods. # Despite the key role played by glycosylation, clinically approved and novel targeted therapeutic approaches for gastric and colorectal tumors have mostly resulted from intense genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Moreover, few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gastric and colorectal tumors, mostly due to its intrinsic molecular complexity. This has significantly delayed the development and translation of glycan-based diagnostic and therapeutic solutions to clinical routine. Recently, the simplification and standardization of glycobiology-based methods have provided powerful analytical tools to improve our understanding of glycosylation alterations on specific cancer-associated proteins. This review summarizes recent insights from innovative research on the glycobiology of gastric and colorectal tumors. It emphasizes the O-glycome and glycoproteome, envisaging the identification of more specific cancer glycobiomakers and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it comprehensively discusses the implications of combining glycosylation, large scale genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics toward true precision medicine settings. # Protein glycosylation in gastrointestinal cancer : molecular mechanisms underlying the aberrant glycan biosynthesis # Perhaps the most studied cancer-associated glycoepitopes in gastric and colorectal cancers derive from a premature stop in the elongation of protein O-GalNAc glycosylation 16,37,41. These antigens have been classically termed as simple mucin-type O-glycans, reflecting the abundance of this type of glycosylation in mucins. Nevertheless, these types of glycans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein expressing O-glycosylation sites. O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis can be initiated by up to 20 polypeptide GalNAc transferases( GalNAc-Ts), which are responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a N-acetylgalactosamine residue from UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr, originating the Tn antigen( Fig. 1) 42-44. The different GalNAcTs present a cell and tissue-specific expression 45, showing distinct and partially overlapping peptide substrate specificities that are crucial for O-glycosites definition 46. There have been reports of an increased density of O-glycans in gastric and colon tumors, resulting from an increased GalNAc-Ts activity in tumor cells compared to normal cells 20,47. In most normal gastrointestinal cells, the Tn antigen is further elongated by core 1 **25;17515;TOOLONG( C1GalT). This reaction originates the core 1 or Thomsen-Friedenreich( T) -antigen( Gal1-3GalNAc-Ser/Thr), in a process dependent on the functional chaperone COSMC( Fig. 1) 48. The initial GalNAc may be extended and originate the core 3, catalyzed by **36;17542;TOOLONG 6( 3Gn-T6). Core 3 may be further substituted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, originating core 4( Fig. 1). On the other hand, core 1 may originate core 2, catalyzed by **37;17618;TOOLONG( C2GnTs). Core structures are frequently further elongated and terminated with ABO and Lewis blood groups determinants, as depicted in Fig. 1. The downregulation of 3Gn-T6 and C3GnT was shown to suppress metastasis in colon carcinoma, suggesting that core structures may play a key role in cancer progression 49. C1GalT is often overexpressed in tumors, resulting in an accumulation of T antigens, which has been associated with disease progression, metastasis and decreased survival 20,38. Early sialylation also decisively contributes to a premature stop in O-glycan extension, leading to an accumulation of immature sialylated structures such as sialyl-Tn( STn ; **25;17657;TOOLONG), mostly due to the increased expression of sialyltransferases like ST6GalNAc1 37,50. The overexpression of Tn and STn has been observed in both early and advanced stage disease, generally associated with poor outcome 51,52. Notably, pre-malignant and early stage colorectal tumors overexpress the STn antigen 53-55 due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonic mucins from degradation by intestinal bacteria 58. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these transformations are not yet fully understood. Other modifications occurring in sialic acids may include a substitution of Neu5Ac by non-human Neu5G from dietary sources 59. Recently, high levels of Neu5Ac were associated with increased consumption of red meat and as a promoter of systemic inflammation and cancer 60. Furthermore, several studies report an overexpression of the T antigen sialylated form in colorectal carcinomas 61, whose contribution to disease warrants in depth investigation. # In addition, gastric and colorectal tumors present high levels of SLeA( **28;17684;TOOLONG) and SLeX( **28;17714;TOOLONG) as terminal epitopes of protein O-glycans 62,63, but also of N-glycans and glycolipids 64,65. In fact, SLeA and SLeX have been found to be highly expressed in many solid tumors, including digestive track carcinomas, and their expression levels have been correlated with metastasis and poor survival in cancer patients 66-68. These antigens are structurally related with Lewis antigen determinants LeA and LeX, resulting from the 2,3sialylation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by either 1,4 or 1,3-fucosylation( structural details and biosynthesis depicted in Fig. 1B). SLeA/X are specific ligands for E- and P-selectins in endothelial cells, thereby acting as regulators of the metastatic cascade by promoting the adhesion of malignant cells to the endothelium( Fig. 2) 69,70. Selectin ligands are also thought to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis 32,71,72. # SLeA/X elevation in O-glycans has been mostly associated with C2GnT overexpression and consequently core 2 biosynthesis 62,63. In N-glycans, SLeA/X overexpression may also be potentiated by the 1,6-branching of N-glycans, followed by further elongation with polylactosamine, whose role in cancer has been recently revised by several authors 16,21. In addition, the Helicobacter pylori-induced expression of a 1,3-GlcNAc transferase, responsible for the synthesis of Type1/2 chains precursors in glycolipids, drives SLeA/X accumulation and carcinogenesis in gastric tissues 73. The overexpression of this enzyme was also observed in colonic cancer tissues 74. Nevertheless, in normal gastric and colonic mucosa, both type 1( Gal1,3GlcNAc1-R) and type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However, malignant transformations in the colon are frequently accompanied by a downregulation of 3GalT5 77 that synthesizes type 1 chains in epithelia, and a upregulation of 4GalT-I 78 and IV 79, leading to an increase in type 2 chains( precursor for SLeX) 76. Importantly, the overexpression of SLeX/A antigens in gastric and colorectal cancers may also be influenced by " incomplete " and " neo " biosynthesis of terminal Lewis-related antigens. Regarding incomplete biosynthesis, nonmalignant epithelial cells of the digestive tract predominantly express disialyl LeA( diSLeA), presenting an additional O-6 linked sialic acid in comparison to SLeA 80-82. The diSLeA antigens act has ligands for lymphocyte inhibitory receptors Siglecs-7 and -9 expressed on monocytes and macrophages, thereby contributing to maintaining immunological homeostasis in digestive organs 83,84. Epigenetic silencing of the 2,6-sialyltransferase encoding gene is thought to be among the main events driving the shift from di- to mono-sialylated LeA antigens in cancer 84. These events ultimately contribute to impairment of normal recognition of cancer cells by lymphoid cells. On the other hand, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeX, cancer cells often accumulate significant amounts of SLeX 85. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for this alteration : i) decreased expression of intestine-specific **26;17744;TOOLONG GlcNAc6ST 86-88 ; and ii) downregulation of the sulfate transporter gene, which has also been implicated in enhanced cell proliferation 89. Recently, the downregulation of B4GALNT2 and the consequent decrease in histo-blood group carbohydrate antigen Sda( GalNAc1-4Neu5Ac2-3Gal) levels was also found to drive SLeX overexpression in colonic tumors 90. In addition, no significant alterations have been found in the transcript levels of different fucosyl and sialyltransferases involved in SLeX biosynthesis 91-93. In summary, epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation significantly contribute to SLeX/A overexpresion, particularly during the early stages of disease 94. In locally advanced tumors, hypoxia also plays a key role in glycome remodeling and SLeA/X neosynthesis ; namely, oxygen shortage has been shown to act as a trigger for epigenetic silencing and transcriptional induction of several glycogenes 94-97 and alterations in glucose metabolic fluxes directly implicated in glycosylation pathways 98,99. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overexpress truncated, sialylated, and fucosylated O-glycans that favor disease progression and dissemination. In particular, glycome remodeling translates in the accumulation of simple-mucin type O-glycans and selectin ligands, which decisively contribute to disease outcome. Despite significant advances in understanding the biological events driving these alterations, a significant amount of questions remain unanswered regarding biosynthesis pathways ; namely, most studies are target-driven, based on cancer cell models and/or a small number of patients, lacking the necessary pan-omics approach, such asglycomics,( glyco) proteomics, **29;17772;TOOLONG, and metabolomics, to unravel the complex nature of cancer-associated glycosylation. Nevertheless, key structural and biological insights have been provided to address the context-specific nature of cancer-associated glycans and its clinical implications in large and well characterized patient samples. # Role of O-glycosylation and sialylated Lewis antigens in gastric and colorectal carcinogenesis and cancer progression # Glycans play major roles during the process of gastric carcinogenesis, being particularly relevant for the gastric pathogen H.pylori infection ; namely, H.pylori expresses cell-surface lipopolysaccharides carrying Lewis blood group determinants in mimicry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential for escaping immune response and maintaining asymptomatic colonization 103. Furthermore, the interaction between bacterial outer-membrane adhesins and host glycan receptors, including fucosylated type 1, LacdiNAc-motifs( GalNAc1-4GlcNAc1-) and sialylated-Lewis antigens, is a critical step for H.pylori colonization of the stomach niche 104-108. LacdiNAc is a rare terminal structure in mammals, but gastric MUC5AC has been shown to carry this terminal modification 109 and a GalNAc transferase( **37;17803;TOOLONG III) present in human gastric tissue was demonstrated to biosynthesize the LacdiNAc epitope 110. In contrast, 1,4-GlcNAc-capped O-glycans, which are synthesized by **35;17842;TOOLONG( alpha4GnT) and expressed by the deeper gastric glands, have been shown to present a natural antimicrobial activity 111,112. This antibiotic effect has been attributed to inhibition of the cholesterol -glucosyltransferase enzymatic activity and therefore interfering with H.pylori cell wall biosynthesis and impairing bacterial growth 113-115. Moreover, 1,4-GlcNAc expression has been shown to prevent gastric cancer by suppressing tumor-promoting inflammation 116. Remarkably, the different stages of the gastric carcinogenesis pathway are accompanied by striking changes of the gastric cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucosa expresses mainly neutral glycans, H.pylori infection and chronic inflammation promote de novo expression of negatively charged sialylated and sulfated glycans 73,117,118, thereby increasing bacterial adhesion to gastric cells. Aberrant cell surface glycosylation is not exclusive of the initial gastric carcinogenesis stages, being also observed in pre-malignant conditions and constituting a marked feature of gastric carcinoma cells 14. # Moreover, the aberrant expression of simple mucin-type carbohydrate antigen structures in cancer cells has been widely reported, and the extent of this expression has been correlated with the aggressive phenotype and invasive potential of various cancer types, including gastric and colorectal tumors 51,52,119-124. Several studies directed to Tn and STn antigens indicated that these antigens are highly expressed in gastric carcinomas 31,37,52,122 as well as in poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the colon 61. Furthermore, gastric cancer cells glycoengineered to overexpress the STn antigen presented a more aggressive phenotype 31. This included decreased cell-cell aggregation, as well as increased extracellular-matrix( ECM) adhesion and migration, resulting in tumor cell invasion 31. In addition, the overexpression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, promoting colon cancer progression 47. Some reports have also focused on evaluating the role of altered protein O-glycosylation in tumor cell apoptosis ; nevertheless, the mechanisms through which these events take place are far from clear. For instance, alterations in the O-glycosylation of death receptors in colorectal cancer cells have been suggested to affect sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL by promoting ligand-induced receptor clustering and consequent caspase-8 activation 125. Moreover, O-glycosylation inhibitors showed induction of apoptosis and downregulation of proliferation in colorectal cancer cells 126. In addition, the T antigen is not expressed by the normal colonic mucosa 61,127, mostly due to masking by sialylation 128. However it is present in most tumors 61,127 and significantly overexpressed in metastasis 129. This antigen interacts with galectin-3 and is thought to play a key role in mediating homotypic aggregation of cancer cells 130,131, protecting cells from anoikis 131. In addition, it may promote the galectin-3 mediated docking of tumor cells to endothelial cells 132 favoring metastasis. Moreover, T expression by cancer cells induces galectin-3 expression by endothelial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T antigen expression has also been found to mediate the induction proliferative signaling, mediated by c-Met and MAPK 134-136. # As outlined in the previous section, increased tumor cell sialylation has an important impact in cellular recognition, adhesion and signaling 14,16,137. Particularly, SLeA and SLeX have been demonstrated to be highly expressed in many cancers, and their expression levels have been correlated with metastasis and poor survival in cancer patients 66,67. The overexpression of SLeX in gastric carcinoma cells has been shown to induce c-Met activation and an invasive phenotype 32. Furthermore, SLeA and SLeX have been demonstrated to be preferential ligands for selectins on activated endothelial cells, thereby playing a key role in the metastatic process 16,138-140. # These findings highlight the plethora of biological events mediated by altered glycosylation in cancer, and the need to invest in deciphering its role in cell invasion and metastasis, which will certainly translate into novel and more effective therapeutics. # Diagnostic and prognostic implications of altered glycosylation in gastric and colorectal cancers # Specific truncated O-glycans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoplastic lesions, when compared with their normal counterparts 16. Moreover, these alterations often associate with clinicopathological variables, such as lymph node metastasis, tumor stage and recurrence 141,142. Furthermore, cancer-associated glycans are often shed into the bloodstream and can potentially be used for non-invasive detection 143,144. In fact, glycosylated epitopes are widely used in clinical practice as non-invasive biomarkers for gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and for monitoring disease progression. Moreover, these epitopes can be used as prognostic markers of gastrointestinal patients ' survival after tumor surgery 22,145,146. The screening of glycobiomarkers in patient samples presents limitations related to the organ specificity and sensitivity for cancer lesions of some glycoconjugates. Nevertheless, several clinically approved serological assays are currently used for the quantification of specific glycobiomarkers in the serum of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. These include carbohydrate epitopes( CA19.9 and CA72.4) but also heavily glycosylated glycoproteins such as the carcinoembryonic antigen( CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein( AFP), whose specific glycoforms may hold potential to improve non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis. # CA19.9 # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitatively altered in cancer cells. The CA19.9 test recognizes the sialylated terminal structure SLeA in O-glycoproteins, such as mucins, and in glycolipids. This serological test is broadly used to monitor recurrence and response to therapy in gastric, colorectal, pancreatic and biliary cancer patients 147. Particularly, CA19.9 is the most studied and validated tumor marker used to monitor pancreatic cancer patients ' response to therapy every 1-3 months 148. CA19.9 serum levels present more than 80% of sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer symptomatic patients 149. Furthermore, in gastric cancer, CA19.9 positivity before surgery is considered a risk factor for gastric cancer recurrence 150. In colon cancer, high levels of CA19.9 have a prognostic significance of decreased survival 151,152. Despite these observations, there is limited application of this serological marker in gastric and colorectal cancer diagnosis due to frequent false positives in patients with benign diseases 146,153. However, it has been proposed that the diSLeA/ SLeA ratio may be used to reduce this limitation 140. # CA72.4 # Elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, can be detected by the serological assay CA72.4 in gastric and colorectal tumors 146,154,155. The CA72.4 detection of STn in the serum of healthy individuals has been shown to be limited. However, STn detection was reported in individuals with precursor lesions of gastric cancer 156. In gastric cancer, the detection of this marker can be used as an independent prognostic factor associated with aggressiveness, poor prognosis and tumor recurrence 143,145,157. Nevertheless, the use of the CA72.4 serological assay has also limited application for screening and diagnostic purposes. # CEA # CEA is a glycoprotein expressed by various gastrointestinal tissues. The serological assay that detects this glycoprotein is commonly used in clinical practice to monitor therapy successes and to evaluate recurrence after surgery in colorectal cancer patients 158-160. CEA levels are used in pre-operative conditions for tumor staging and treatment planning 158,161,162. However, sensitivity limitations of the CEA serological assay prevent early stage disease detection 163. Moreover, CEA increased levels in non-cancer-related patients exclude general population screening applications. Notwithstanding, CEA increased levels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients 147. # In order to monitor therapy response and metastasis in stage II and stage III colorectal cancer patients, it is recommended that CEA levels be measured, after surgery, every 3 months, during at least 3 years after diagnosis. Nevertheless, falsely elevated CEA levels should be taken into consideration during the first weeks of chemotherapy 147. Recent glycomic studies have demonstrated that tumor tissues express specific CEA glycoforms that can be exploited to improve the predictive potential of this biomarker 164,165. # AFP # AFP is an albumin-related glycoprotein, present in fetal serum, commonly used as a glycobiomarker for liver diseases, including cancer 166,167. Despite the high levels of this marker in hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC), it was also present in benign liver conditions 168,169. Importantly, only the fucosylated form of AFP( AFP-L3) is differentially detected in hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to benign liver diseases 170. The use of this marker has been approved by FDA for early stage HCC diagnosis. # In summary, while classical cancer-associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-invasive disease follow-up, prognosis and response to treatment, they present significant limitations for early detection. Nevertheless, recent advances in high-throughput glycan analysis technologies( see novel glycomic and glycoproteomic strategies bellow) contributed to glycoproteome characterization and consequent discovery of several new putative glycobiomarkers for gastric and colorectal cancers 41,156,171-173 ; namely, STn-expressing plasminogen glycoforms have been advanced as specific serological markers of gastric carcinoma precursor lesions and gastric carcinoma 41,156, which now warrant clinical validation. In addition, a comprehensive array of abnormally O-glycosylated mucin-derived glycopeptides has been used for seromic profiling of colorectal cancer patients. Autoantibodies have been identified from a set of aberrant glycopeptides derived from MUC1 and MUC4, with a cumulative sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 92% 174. Such approach demonstrates the potential of glycan-mediated humoral responses in the diagnostic context as well as a tool for the identification of abnormally glycosylated proteins, as demonstrated by us for esophageal tumors 175. Altogether, these early studies have decisively demonstrated that abnormal glycosylation holds a tremendous opportunity to improve on the specificity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is now time for the glycobiomarker discovery field to evolve from the proof-of-concept studies toward comprehensive clinical settings. It will also be important to take into consideration the complex and multifactorial nature of the diseases. As such, the combination of multiple biomarkers of different molecular natures will likely translate into more accurate diagnosis and predictive models. # Novel glycomics and glycoproteomic strategies for biomarker discovery in cancer # Combining molecular information from glycan and peptide moieties holds tremendous potential for designing highly specific targeted therapeutics. However, the fact that glycan structures do not follow a predefine template, but are rather the result of the highly regulated action of several glycosyltransferases rapidly responding to microenviromental and physiological stimuli, presents a significant analytical hurdle. # Nevertheless, glycomics-based chromatography and mass spectrometry( MS) methods have reached a standardization stage, providing highly sensitive analytical tools for precise mapping of the glycome 176,177. Common analytical workflows begin with the selective release of the N-glycans from the protein backbone by PNGase F treatment, followed by the chemical release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be directly identified by MS, the significant peeling of the protein backbone derived from chemical O-deglycosylation makes protein identification difficult. Then, glycans are often separated by liquid chromatography( LC), using nanodimension columns capable of high-resolution separations of minute amounts of complex glycan mixtures( nano-fentomnole) in a single run prior to MS analysis 179,180. Labeling glycans with fluorophores, namely, 2-aminobenzamide, anthranilic acid or 2-aminobenzoic acid, has also provided a valuable tool for quantitative approaches by LC, being also compatible with downstream MS analyses 178. Furthermore, chromatographic methods as well as tandem MS experiments have provided means to distinguish highly complex isomeric glycans, a determinant step to establish accurate structure-function relationships 181,182. Despite these observations, few studies have comprehensively addressed the glycome of gastric and colorectal tumors. Regarding gastric cancer, emphasis has been given to screening the patients ' serum, envisaging tumor biomarkers for non-invasive detection 41,156,183,184. Contrastingly, most studies regarding colorectal cancer have focused on tumor and cell line analysis 185-187. These preliminary approaches consensually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proteins. A comprehensive glycomic characterization of larger sets of well characterized patient samples is now needed for translation to clinical settings. # Glycomic studies are of key importance for the identification of abnormally glycosylated proteins and for precise glycosite assignment. Nevertheless, significant analytical difficulties arise from the high molecular heterogeneity and low concentration of these species in biological milieus. As such, most glycoprotemic workflows comprehend a pre-enrichment step, using lectin affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation with glycan-specific monoclonal antibodies( Fig. 3) 188,189. Likewise, the enrichment of sialylated glycoproteins by TiO2 affinity has also been successfully applied for identification of serum glycoproteins associated with gastric pre-malignant and malignant lesions 156. The proteins are then digested to peptides with trypsin or other proteolytic enzymes and analyzed using standard proteomics. Nevertheless, densely glycosylated peptide domains may resist proteolytic cleavage, hampering their identification by conventional MS approaches. Frequently, protocols include an enrichment step for glycopeptides carrying the glycans of interest, prior to nanoLC tandem MS analysis, facilitating glycosite mapping. The development of high-resolution orbitrap mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) with Electron-transfer dissociation-type( ETD) fragmentation have enabled the simultaneous and precise characterization of glycan structures and glycosites, significantly boosting glycoproteomic studies 190,191( Fig. 3). # Much effort has also been put in the development of genetically engineered cancer cell models expressing simple and homogeneous O-glycans, mimicking the O-glycosylation found in solid tumor 31,51,192,193. In particular, the recent SimpleCell technology approach, exploring zinc-finger nucleases to knockout the COSMC gene, has been applied in a number of different human cancer cell lines, including colorectal cancer cells 192,193. This allowed a precision mapping of the human O-GalNAc glycoproteome, which revealed over 6000 glycosites in more than 600 O-glycoproteins, mostly from the cell surface, greatly expanding the view of the O-glycoproteome and its functional role 193. More recently, our group as applied a similar glycoproteomic strategy to the characterization of the wild type gastric cell line( KATO III), which naturally expresses partially truncated O-glycans, and two gastric cancer SimpleCells( AGS, MKN45) 41. Over 499 O-glycoproteins and 1236 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total 47 O-glycoproteins and 73 O-glycosites in the KATO III cell line. The same study led to the identification of 28 STn-glycosylated proteins in the serum of gastric patients that were absent from healthy individuals. Two identified candidate O-glycoprotein biomarkers( CD44 and GalNAc-T5) were further validated in gastric cancer tissues using immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assay 41. In particular, this technique allowed the simultaneous detection of the glycan and the protein moieties, holding tremendous potential in clinical sample screening 41,194,195. These strategies provided crucial information on the whole O-glycoproteome and brought light into a particular set of O-glycoprotein candidates with biomarker potential in gastric cancer. It is expected that these analytical and technological advances can be merged toward their application in future clinical settings. # Targeting O-glycosylation in cancer toward novel therapeutics # Modulation of glycosylation biosynthesis pathways # Since glycans and glycoconjugates orchestrate various steps of tumor genesis and progression, the cellular biosyntheticmachinery involved in glycan biosynthesis constitutes an obvious target for therapeutic strategies. Therefore, glycan-based therapeutic approaches attract remarkable interest for drug development( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glycans is enzymatically coordinated by specific glycosyltransferases. As such, large efforts have been made to design efficient inhibitors of GT activity based on acceptor or donor analogues and transition state mimetics( Fig. 4) 196. During the past years, the amount of glycosylation modifiers produced has increased. However, only a few achieved a biologically significant inhibitory activity. Among the successful strategies are bivalent imidazolium salts, which have been shown to efficiently inhibit glycosyltransferase catalytic activity 197,198. However, the in vivo efficacy of these compounds remains to be demonstrated. Inhibition of the sialic acid content at the cell surface has also been at the focus of glycosylation modulator research as a promising strategy to modulate cancer cell behavior. Interestingly, natural and synthetic compounds have been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of 2,3-sialyltranserase activity, reducing cell surface sialylation and suppressing cancer cell metastasis 199-202. # Glycosylation-targeted anti-cancer drugs with therapeutic applications hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic tools focused on modulation of cancer cell glycan epitopes. The unraveling of the complex GTs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the improved synthetic capacity of structurally modifying carbohydrates, will definitely promote the production of more efficient and specific inhibitors to be used in anti-cancer chemotherapy. # Theragnostic antibodies and immunotherapy strategies # Targeting altered glycosylation as an immunotherapeutic strategy is a major field of research in the fight against cancer 33,203. The use of anticancer vaccines that target tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens provides an appealing option( Fig. 4). However, because alterations of glycosylation in cancer have variable immunogenicity and may induce immunotolerance, several limitations have been described in initial studies 35,204. One such limitation is the moderate induction of the T-cell-mediated immunity that is critical for efficient cancer therapy 33,205. Nevertheless, several attempts have been devoted to overcome these limitations and improve the cancer-associated carbohydrate vaccine immunogenicity, namely, the use of covalently coupled carbohydrate antigens to certain carrier molecules in order to form clustered or multi-epitope conjugated vaccines 206-209. Strategies as combining carbohydrate antigens with T-cell peptide epitopes or an immunostimulant epitope to form fully synthetic multicomponent glycoconjugate vaccines are among the most reported approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific targets expressed in tumor cells, leading to the induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity( ADCC)( Fig. 4) 16,213,214. Other studies have shown that ADCC is also a key mechanism by which some currently used therapeutic antibodies mediate their anti-tumor effects 215,216. The development of novel glycoprotein-specific antibodies is likely to provide novel tools with high specificity and large clinical potential. # Novel guided nanodrugs are also emergent therapies against digestive tract tumors and have already shown great potential for improving disease outcome in pre-clinical and clinical drug development phases 217. Exploring the cell-surface nature of cancer-associated glycans may provide the necessary means to selectively deliver anti-cancer nanodrugs to tumor cells. Advances in the glycomic and glycoproteomic fields associated with the development of selective ligands for clinically relevant glycoepitopes are expected to generate in the near future relevant nanotherapeutics 217. Finally, the establishment of animal models reflecting the glycosylation patterns of human tumors, as is the case of patient-derived cancer xenografts 218 and chemically induced tumors 219, is also of primary importance for biological studies and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks and future perspectives # The alterations of glycosylation observed in human cancer reflect several genetic, epigenetic and metabolic alterations in the tumor cells. The capacity to understand and detect the molecular basis of such alterations of glycosylation can have several implications : i) the application of novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, ii) the development of inhibitors that can interfere with glycan-mediated functions of cancer cells, and iii) the design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. Therefore, we are convinced that targeting specific glycans would allow complementing the conventional cancer detection and therapeutic strategies, leading to better diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Nevertheless, the similarities and differences that are observed in the glycosylation patterns of different tumors highlight the dynamic and complex nature of the glycome and glycoproteome, as well as their dependence on the cell and tissue background and microenvironment. Furthermore, the evidence that some glycans may present different biological roles in different tumors supports the need for a comprehensive analysis of the glycoproteome in a clinical context. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized patient sets, in order to disclose the biological roles of glycans in cancer and to move toward the definition of a true precision medicine setting. We believe that current developments in cell glycoengineering and MS-based analytical tools will decisively contribute to these developments. Particular emphasis should also be devoted to the glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of metastasis, which has remained an unaddressed matter. This information will be of key importance to develop therapeutic strategies against disseminated disease, which is ultimately a major cause of death. # In summary, as cancer treatment moves toward precision medicine, by which prognostic and therapeutic schemes are decided based on the patient 's clinical history and the molecular nature of the tumor, it becomes critical to consider a holistic approach that should also include comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics. # Conflict of interest statement # None declared. # Acknowledgments # This work was supported by European Union funds( FEDER/COMPETE) and by national funds( FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) under the projects with the references FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER 028188 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support by Gastric Glyco Explorer Initial Training Network( Seventh Framework Programme grant number 316929).
