4080641 Considering the coping effect and health connections of diary-keeping behaviour, the purpose of the present study was to investigate diary-keeping in relation to happiness and gender among Turkish teacher trainees. A sample of 417 teacher trainees between the ages of 18 and 29 was surveyed. Happiness was considered as consisting of positive and negative affect and life satisfaction. The results revealed mostly dissatisfaction with life among Turkish teacher trainees. Females reported more negative affect than males do. Although no significant relationships were found between happiness and diary-keeping, gender differences in diary-keeping behaviour were found in favour of females. Key Words : teacher trainees ; diary-keeping ; happiness ; culture 1. Introduction Improving the personal development of teacher trainees is as important as improving their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge during their pre-service years. Considering the role of teachers in the intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual development of their students, administrators, curriculum planners, instructors and counsellors working with teacher trainees are primarily expected to contribute to the personal development of teacher trainees before starting to serve as teachers and role models for their students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in contributing to the personal development of teacher trainees face within the recent literature. Happy teacher trainees, those who are satisfied with their lives, experience frequent joy, and infrequent unpleasant emotions such as anger and sadness, are supposed to engage more in intellectual and personal activities, which in turn enhances their total development through their pre-service years. Moreover, happy teacher trainees are supposed to become happy teachers in the future. Considering the characteristics of happy people mentioned in the literature, investigating diary-keeping behaviour among teacher trainees seem crucial, since keeping a diary has the potential to contribute to self-discovery and personal development. Moreover, diary-keeping is a self-initiated coping behaviour( Burt, 1994a, 1994b) that may cause or affect happiness. 1.1. Studies on happiness As a result of the positive paradigm in the field of psychology( Seligman &; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000), the investigation of happiness has attracted attention since the middle of the twentieth century. Happiness has been investigated especially by using the term subjective well-being( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life satisfaction( the cognitive aspect), the presence of positive affect, and the absence of negative affect( the affective aspects)( Diener, 1984 ; Diener, Suh, &; Oishi, 1997 ; Myers &; Diener, 1995). Over the years, several studies have examined the correlates of happiness, revealing weak relationships with demographic variables such as education, ethnic status, and age( Campbell, Convers, &; Rodgers, 1976) but very strong positive relationships with some psychological characteristics such as self-esteem( Ayyash-Abdo &; Alamuddin, 2007 ; Diener, et al., 1995), optimism( Aspinwall &; Taylor, 1992 ; Lucas, Diener, &; Suh, 1996 ; Scheier &; Carver, 1992), extraversion( Diener, et al., 1992), personal control( Larson, 1989), and fulfilling one 's goals( Emmons, 1996 ; Ryan et al., 1996). National and cultural differences in happiness were especially underlined in the literature( Diener, Suh, Oishi, &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oishi &; Diener, 2001), indicating that, in economically developed wealthier countries where people possesses greater freedom and human rights, and where an emphasis on individualism exists, people reported a higher degree of subjective well-being. According to Diener and Suh( 2003), people in individualistic nations report higher degrees of self-fulfilment than people in collectivist nations, due to their freedom in following their own interests and desires, as occurs in individualistic cultures. Nevertheless, less social support during troubled periods increases the suicide and divorce rates in individualistic nations. Therefore, although more common in individualistic cultures, extreme levels of happiness are not prevalent among collectivists since they have a safer cultural structure. Moreover, as stated by Diener and Suh( 2003), some nations appeared to be more emotional than others. For instance, although the citizens of Turkey and Japan had about the same life satisfaction and hedonic balance scores, Turks reported much higher levels of pleasant and unpleasant affect. Hence, considering cultural differences is important in studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in studies of happiness. Several studies reported inconsistent findings on gender differences in happiness. For instance, some studies revealed a trend toward women 's reporting greater experience and expression of positive moods than men( Nolen-Hoeksema, &; Rusting, 2003 ; Wood, Rhodes, &; Whelan, 1989), whereas some others stated that men have a slight tendency toward higher positive affection( Haring, Stock, &; Okun, 1984). A sample of Lebanese adolescents, Ayyash-Abdo( 2003) reported higher negative emotion scores for female adolescents than for male adolescents. Gender differences have been explained using biological, personality, and social context factors( Nolen-Hoeksema, &; Rusting, 2003 ; Perneger, Hudelson, &; Bovier, 2004). In addition, Diener and friends( 1991) reported that the effect of social desirability bias among females resulted in their " overstating " their level of happiness. Additionally, happiness was found to be related with the coping styles of individuals. While happy people tend to engage in effective ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from others, and seeing the bright side of events, unhappy people tend to use passive or inefficient styles such as engaging in fantasy, avoiding working on problems, and blaming others and themselves( McCrae &; Costa, 1986). Keeping a diary is a self-initiated coping behaviour( Burt, 1994a, 1994b) and hence may cause or affect happiness. Although the literature points to many physical and psychological benefits of written self-expression behaviour, the relationship between happiness and keeping a diary is still unknown. 1.2. Studies on written disclosure People may express their thoughts and feelings in a meaningful and personal way through writing, and they may gain a sense of control due to the expression of those thoughts and feelings in a confidential manner( Mazza, 2003). They may learn about themselves through writing about the important things in their lives -- their goals, achievements, etc. -- in a diary. Additionally, some studies have indicated that writing about traumatic experiences brings about comparable changes to talking to psychotherapists among psychologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Lamnin, &; Carver, 1989). The therapeutic value of writing about experiences have been widely emphasised in the literature, indicating significant mental and physical health improvements in different age groups after individuals write expressively about emotional experiences. For instance, several studies have found that participants who write down their deepest thoughts and emotions about significant events show increased general health and well-being( Pennebaker, 1997), reduced medical visits( Pennebaker &; Beall, 1986), fewer days absent from school, improved liver enzyme function( Francis &; Pennebaker, 1992), increased academic achievement( Cameron &; Nicholls, 1998), better immune function( Esterling, et al., 1994), a decrease in upper respiratory symptoms, tension, or fatigue, a tendency to reunite with ex-partners after a breakup( Lepore &; Greenberg, 2002), and decreased sleep onset latency( Harvey &; Farrel, 2003). Stress and anxiety were also found to be reduced following written emotional expression( Ireland, Malouf, &; Byrne, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burt, 1994b). Nevertheless, the existing literature calls attention to the effect of gender on the benefits of writing, indicating more benefits for males after writing interventions( Manier &; Olivares, 2005 ; Smyth, 1998). These results are explained by gender differences in emotional expressiveness. The tendency among males toward not expressing emotions with words but rather with their behaviours( e.g., Bruch, 2002 ; Goldsmith &; Weller, 2000 ; Brody, 2000 ; Tylor et al., 2000 ; Kring &; Gordon, 1998 ; Guttman &; Laporte, 2002), and the self-confidence among females regarding verbal expressions of emotion( Blier &; Blier-Wilson, 1989), are well-known. Different from designed writing interventions, diary-keeping is a self-initiated behaviour people engage in, a writing activity without special encouragement by anyone( such as a counsellor or other mental health professional). Hence, there might be as many different kinds of diaries as there are diarists( Bolton, 1999). Besides, keeping a diary appears in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is possible to keep a diary by using computer programs that are designed specifically for this purpose. People who may prefer the spoken word rather than the written word may keep audio diaries/journals. Also, through access to the internet, personal storytelling becomes possible via online journaling and blog writing. In any case, a diary is a very personal thing designed to be read only by the writers unless they decide otherwise, and which therefore can not be criticised as being right or wrong. Therefore, people could benefit from very different kinds of diaries. Although the many benefits of writing on mental and physical health mentioned below should be taken into consideration when one is investigating the effects of diary-keeping behaviours of teacher trainees, findings associated with previous research that focused specifically on diary-keeping behaviour have a special importance for the present study. The most striking findings regarding diary-keeping behaviours underlined the effects of gender and developmental stage. Gender was found to be related with the prevalence of diary-keeping behaviour. For instance, Burt( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian student sample( N=52), and 77.2% of the females( N=145), were diarists. In two other surveys conducted on university students, Burt( 1994a) replicated these findings. According to the results of his first survey, 32% of the males and 72.6% of the females reported keeping a diary at the time of the survey or having kept a diary in past. Similarly, in his second survey, 67.7% of males and 90.9% of female subjects reported keeping a diary at the time of the survey or having kept a diary in past. The motive for diary-keeping behaviour was also found to differ across gender groups. Males tend to keep a diary as an aid in recalling past and future events, while females use diaries for emotional expression. Hence, gender appears to be both a predictor and a motive for diary-keeping( Burt, 1994a). In addition to gender differences, the existing literature also revealed the effects of developmental stage on the prevalence of diary-keeping behaviour. Associated with the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological changes, sexuality, and opposite-sex relationships during adolescence, diary-keeping seems particularly prevalent during this period of life( Burt, 1994a). Moreover, studies on American introductory psychology students indicated that about half of the students reported they were diarists( Rubin, 1982, Thomson, 1982). These findings were replicated in a more recent study on Australian university students( Burt, 1994a). However, whether these findings remain valid in nonwestern countries is still a challenging topic. 1.3. The present study Considering all the research findings mentioned above, an investigation of the happiness level of Turkish teacher trainees in relation to their diary-keeping behaviours is supposed to contribute to the interventions that cultivate the personal and professional development of this group. Although diary-keeping behaviour as a self-initiated coping strategy has the potential to contribute the happiness levels of teacher trainees, the relationship between happiness and diary-keeping is still a little-known area, since few studies have examined diary-keeping as a coping style. Moreover, whether western findings on happiness and diary-keeping will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for question, since Turkey is an economically developing country in a transition period between protecting its basically collectivist nature and increasingly reflecting western individualistic characteristics( Aydin-Mocan, 2007). Therefore, with the aim of examining the happiness levels of Turkish teacher trainees in relation to self-initiated coping-style diary-keeping, and in the light of the existing happiness and diary-keeping literatures, the answers to the following questions were examined in the present study : What is the prevalence of DKB among Turkish teacher trainees? If they prefer to express themselves by writing their emotions and ideas in personal diaries, who are these diarist teacher trainees? Can we say that they are females more often than males? Or can we say that they are significantly more or less happy than the non-diarists? 2. Methods 2.1. Participants The sample included 457 teacher trainees, aged 18-29 with a mean of 20.41, attending different departments of the faculty of education of Uludag University, at the time of the data collection in November 2007. Uludag is a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most economically developed region, but it accepts students from all around the country. For the sample of the present study, freshmen were not included to av6id the possible effects of the transition period that takes place in the first year of undergraduate programs. 2.2. Measures In the present study, happiness is considered as consisting of negative and positive affect and satisfaction with life. Hence, two measures were used for happiness : negative and positive affect measured by PANAS, and satisfaction with life measured by SWLS. Participants were also given a demographic questionnaire, which was designed to ask for basic demographic information and explore the diary-keeping behaviours( DKB) of participants. 2.3. Measure of positive and negative affect The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule( PANAS) was developed by Watson, Clark, and Telegen( 1988) as a measure of affective evaluation of life. The instrument includes 10 positive and 10 negative items, which are added together within each sub-scale to determine score for positive and negative affect. Positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert. High PA indicates a state of high energy, full concentration, and pleasurable engagement, whereas low PA is characterised by sadness and lethargy. In contrast, Negative Affect( NA) is a general dimension of subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement that subsumes a variety of aversive mood states, including anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness, with low NA being a state of calmness and serenity( p.1063). Different scores can be obtained from the scale according to different timeframes( moment, today, past few days, year, or general). Both PA and NA subscales of PANAS, as well as a general timeframe, were used to measure the moods of the students in the present study. Participants were asked to indicate " how you feel in general " on a 5-point response scale from 1( very slightly) to 5( extremely). PANAS has been reported to have good internal consistency, with positive and negative affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Watson et al. 1988). The adaptation of the scale to Turkish was made by Genz( 2000). She reported that, consistent with the original study, the results of the factor analysis revealed two factors accounting for 44% of the total variance, and that internal consistencies for PA and NA were.83 and.86, respectively. In the present study, the alpha coefficients for PA and NA were found to be.74 and.79, respectively, indicating sufficient internal consistency. 2.4. Measure of satisfaction with life The Satisfaction with Life Scale( SWLS ; Deiner, et al, 1985) is a five-item scale that measures the cognitive evaluation of one 's life satisfaction. Each item is scored from 1 to 7, " strongly disagree " to " strongly agree. " Item scores are added together to attain a total score, which ranges from 5 to 35, with higher scores reflecting more satisfaction with life. The internal consistency of the scale was.87, and the test-retest reliability for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Smer( 1996) translated the scale into Turkish and reported satisfactory internal consistency( a =.89). In the present study, the alpha coefficient was found to be.76. 2.5. Demographic data form This was a 10-item demographic questionnaire that was developed by the researcher to gather information about basic demographics( age, gender, department, class) and DKB. In the present study, the word " diary " refers to the expression of personal information in a written format. Although in English sometimes the word " journal " is used for " diary ", a journal is differentiated from a diary with regard to the frequency of writing, since generally one writes daily in a diary but less frequently in a journal. In daily Turkish, the word " gnlk " is the equivalent to " diary ", and has been used both for daily and for less frequent writings. In terms of DKB, teacher trainees were asked to choose the best option to describe themselves among the three categories( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is a diarist currently). Teacher trainees in two separate diary-keeping categories( past diarists and current diarists) were also asked the duration of their diary-keeping. 2.6. Procedure Students completed anonymous, classroom-administered questionnaires on a selected day. The instructions written on the cover page of the scales were read to the entire class. Those who volunteered to participate were given relevant directions about the completion of the test, and they were asked to be honest when responding to the test items. The administration of the questionnaires took about 15 minutes. Anonymity was guaranteed. 3. Results 3.1. Description of sample Before conducting the analyses, the data was examined in terms of the duration of diary-keeping behavior, and 78 students were omitted from the data because of their very short-lived( 2 months and below) diary-keeping. Among the rest of the participants, since no one reported diary-keeping between 2 and 6 months, all the teacher trainees who are or were diarists reported at least 6 months ' diary-keeping behavior. In addition, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking into consideration Mahalonobis distance. Consequently, two students were removed from the data because they exceeded the critical value( 16.27 for this study). Thus, the final sample consisted of 377 students. Their mean age was 20.43 years( SD=1.56, range : 18-29). Descriptive analysis indicated that 69.2% of the students( 261) were female, whereas 30.8%( 116) were males. The proportion of students who reported " never having been a diarist ", " being a diarist in the past " or " being a diarist currently " was analysed. 159 students( 42.2%) reported keeping a diary in the past, 42 students( 11.1%) reported keeping a diary currently, and 176 students( 46.7%) had never kept a diary. Furthermore, the mean scores were found to be 48.74( SD= 7.12), 32.83( SD= 6.94), and 14.04( SD=.76) for the PA, NA, and SWLS scores, respectively. The means, standard deviations, and sample sizes across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Table 1. As seen in Table 1, the PA scores for the total sample were higher than the NA scores. Both females and males reported higher PA scores than NA scores. Moreover, mean differences were detected, especially in the PA and NA scores of current female and male diarists. Current female diarists scored higher both on PA and on NA than current male diarists and the other two female DKB groups did, whereas current male diarists scored lower than the current female diarists and the other two male DKB groups. Finally, the mean of the SWLS scores of males who had never kept a diary is lower than the mean of the SWLS scores of all other male and female DKB groups. The SWLS scores of the trainees were below the neutral point( 20) on this scale. As a result, whether these differences are statistically significant was examined through further analyses. 3.2. Results regarding the relationships between happiness and DKB First, Pearson 's product moment correlation coefficients were calculated to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of the bivariate correlations among the variables are presented in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, low correlations were found among all the three dependent variables( PA, NA, LS) of the study. Additionally, no significant relationship was found between DKB and the dependent variables. Thereafter, chi-square analysis was conducted to compare gender groups with reference to the three categories( never, in the past, currently) of DKB. The analysis revealed a significant relationship between gender and DKB. Both among females( 14.6%) and among males( 3.4%), DKB at the present time was rare. However, most of the males( 78.4%) reported no DKB during their lifetime, whereas this proportion was 32.6 percent among females. Similarly, only 18.1% of the males reported having kept a diary in the past, whereas 52.9% of the females reported diary-keeping in the past. In general, DKB occurred more commonly among females than among males. This information is summarised in Table 3. 3.3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, NA, and LS A two-way multivariate analysis of variance( MANOVA) was performed to investigate the effects of diary-keeping behaviour and gender on the three dependent variables of the study. Preliminary assumption testing was conducted to check for normality, linearity, univariate and multivariate outliers, homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices, and multi-collinearity, with no serious violations noted. Results indicated a significant difference between males and females for the combined dependent variables F( 3,369) = 2.63, p=.05. Considering the results for dependent variables separately, this difference was seen in the NA scores IF( 1,371) =5.21, p=.023) of the students. An inspection of the mean scores indicated that females reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than males. However, no significant DKB effect F( 6,738) =.855, p=.528, and no significant DKB X gender interaction effect F( 6,738) = 1.50, p=.175, was found. To reduce the chance of a Type 1 error, a Bonferroni adjustment was applied by dividing alpha level.05 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, p.402). Since there were 3 dependent variables in the present study, dividing.05 by 3, it was decided to consider the results significant only if the probability value was less than.017. Consequently, when the results for the dependent variables were considered separately using a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of.017, no difference reached statistical significance. In other words, neither gender nor DKB has a significant effect on PA, NA, or SWLS. The dependent variables were also not affected by the interaction of gender and DKB. 4. Discussion Considering the previously mentioned national and cultural differences in terms of happiness, and the lack of research on the diary-keeping behaviours of teacher trainees, the present study was the first to investigate happiness in relation to the self-initiated coping behaviour of diary-keeping and gender among Turkish teacher trainees. The results revealed meaningful insights regarding the satisfaction with life, emotions, and diary-keeping behaviours of Turkish teacher trainees. In terms of life satisfaction, Turkish teacher trainees were below the neutral point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their lives( as consistent with the previous findings on national and cultural differences in happiness)( Diener, Suh, Oishi, &; Triandis, 1998 ; Pavot &; Diener, 1993 ; Oishi &; Diener, 2001). In general, the lack of some factors previously emphasised in the literature as determinants of higher levels of happiness in life, such as wealth, economic development, greater freedom, and individualism, might be used as possible explanations for this dissatisfaction. However, the reasons for dissatisfaction deserve to become the focus of future research to provide detailed information for administrators, curriculum planners, instructors and counsellors working with Turkish teacher trainees. Additionally, the results revealed that Turkish teacher trainees experience relatively more positive affect than negative affect in their lives. This finding was expectedly consistent with the findings of earlier research using the same measures( e.g., Ayyash-Abdo &; Alamuddin, 2007 ; Diener, Suh, et al., 1995 ; Lucas, Diener, &; Suh, 1996), since positive feelings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported more negative affect, such as feeling anxious, hurt, or tense, than their male counterparts did, as consistent with the findings of Ayyash-Abdo( 2003) on Lebanese adolescents. This finding gives rise to thoughts regarding socio-cultural effects on females. Turkish culture may affect females ' attitudes toward negative life experiences and emotional expressions via gender roles and stereotypes. Regarding diary-keeping, consistent with the literature on the generality of diary-keeping behaviour in the lives of young people( Burt, 1994a ; Rubin, 1982 ; Thomson, 1982), the findings revealed that over half of the students reported themselves as diarists. Among the diarists, the majority reported keeping a diary in the past, which extended through their adolescence years. Although diary-keeping decreases in the university years, diarists still seem to be considerable among teacher trainees. Therefore, in light of the findings of the present study, counsellors working with teacher trainees could take the familiarity of the trainees with diaries into consideration and take advantage of student diaries as a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their everyday lives without being given a special encouragement by anyone( such as a counsellor or another professional) may assume to be disposed to use these diaries in the counselling process if necessary. Moreover, this does not just affect the counsellors who are providing services for teacher trainees ; knowing about diary-keeping behaviours might also shed light on outdoor and experiential educators. Nevertheless, the results of this study point to gender differences in diary-keeping behaviour. Although diary writing seems to be a common practice of female teacher trainees, diarists seem quite rare among male teacher trainees. A very limited amount of the males reported keeping a diary in the past, which extended to their adolescence years. This amount appeared to decrease even more for the university years. The obtained proportions of diary-keeping among male teacher trainees also seem very low compared to the proportions obtained from western male samples( Burt, 1994a, 1994b). This finding attracts attention to the distance of male Turkish teacher trainees from written emotional expression. However, due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with words but rather through their behaviour( c.f. Bruch, 2002 ; Goldsmith &; Weller, 2000 ; Brody, 2000 ; Tylor et al., 2000 ; Kring &; Gordon, 1998 ; Guttman &; Laporte, 2002), it was not surprising in the present study to see an enormous group of non-diarist males ; considering that teacher trainees constitute the higher intellectual class in this society, the proportions of non-diarists exceed expectations. Since keeping a diary is a way of expressing oneself through in written form, it was thought that boys who do n't prefer to express themselves through words also do n't prefer to express themselves by writing in a diary. However, using such an occasionally preferred activity in the personal development processes of teacher trainees might be beneficial, considering the findings indicating more benefits for males after writing interventions( Manier &; Olivares, 2005 ; Smyth, 1998). Since several studies in the literature revealed the physical and mental health benefits of writing on people( e.g., Burt, 1994b ; Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ireland, Malouf, &; Byrne, 2006 ; Pennebaker &; Beall, 1986) it was expected that we would find an effect of journal writing on the affect and life satisfaction of teacher trainees. Taking the mean scores into consideration, which reveal that current female diarists reported experiencing more positive and negative emotions than current male diarists and the other two female groups( whereas current male diarists reported experiencing lesser positive and negative emotions than current female diarists and the other two male groups did), diary-keeping behaviours seems to increase emotionality among females while decreasing emotionality among males. Moreover, according to the descriptive statistics, nondiarist males scored lowest on life satisfaction, giving rise to the thought that the more they hesitate in terms of written expression, the less satisfied they become with life, or vice versa. However, the differences in mean scores did not reach a statistically significance in multivariate statistics. Therefore, the findings inhibit us from telling much about the relationships among diary-keeping behaviour, gender, and happiness. Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that males who have never kept a diary( non-diarist males) constituted the less satisfied group among all teacher trainees, the possible effects of diary-keeping behaviours on happiness in different gender groups require further investigation in future studies. Moreover, considering today 's many different forms of diaries, future research could explore the demographic and personal characteristics of diarist teacher trainees under the sway of the development in technology in the modern world. Finally, some limitations should be noted in the interpretation and the generalisation of the findings of the present study. First, the fact that the sample was recruited from faculty of education students at a Turkish state university might have been a limitation in terms of the ability to generalise the conclusions for all teacher trainees in Turkey. In order to reflect the characteristics of the general Turkish university students, further research may include teacher trainees from other universities in Turkey. As a second limitation of this study, the measurement of diary-keeping behaviour relied on two items. The students were asked to categorise themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diarist, diarist in the past, current diarist) and then report the duration of diary-keeping behaviour for both past and present. Asking about the content of the diaries in detail could be recommended for further studies in order to attain a better understanding of the nature of teacher trainees ' diaries and whether the content causes or affects happiness. Just knowing about whether someone is a diarist or not seems not to be enough to mention regarding his/her happiness. However, knowing about whether one writes in order to work on problems or life goals, to blame oneself or others for problem situations, or just to organise life and for memory purposes might help to predict one 's level of happiness.
