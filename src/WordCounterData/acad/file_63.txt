4009641 In discussing his method of doing research, Robert Coles( 1990) describes several of his asssumptions : <p>.... we as human beings possess awareness or consciousness, and through language, we try to understand the world around us and convey what we have learned to others. I have also assumed that if I talked to people who were willing to share thoughts and feelings, express ideas, then I would feel a bit more informed. I stop well short of large-scale generalizations....( 22) <p> We share Coles 's assumptions. Students in a class taught by the first author are required to engage in dialogue regarding a values issue that is important to them. The values issue discussed here is the relationship between science and aesthetics. We make no generalizations from the dialogue. Rather, like Coles( 1990), we want " to learn from young people their exquisitely private sense of things... "( 37). Even though this was our modest intent, we also learned something about the art/science of teaching, which we share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edited dialogue between the teacher and juniors in a high school chemistry class, tape recorded with the students ' permission. The " I " of the conversation is the second author. Aesthetics and High School Chemistry <p> I have taught chemistry for several years at the high-school level. I am also interested in art. When I share these two interests with students, they often reply that I must feel divided, like two persons in one body. I have come to realize that many students view the sciences and the humanities as being mutually exclusive areas of human interest and inquiry. <p> I asked my chemistry class if they perceived science and aesthetics as mutually exclusive or as symbiotic, supportive concerns. <p> The response was a collective, " Huh? " <p> I did not want to provide too much of a glimpse of my personal perspective by over-explaining what I meant. Instead, I read them a paragraph from a book by a bongo-playing, Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Richard Feynman, whom one student had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever encountered. I had read excerpts from other physicists before, in the hope of convincing my students that scientists come in a plethora of shapes and sizes and are not limited to the mail-order, pocket-protector, Coke-bottle-glasses variety. <p> The following, from Feynman( 1988), is what I read : <p> I have a friend who 's an artist, and he sometimes takes a view which I do n't agree with. He 'll hold up a flower and say, " Look how beautiful it is, " and I 'll agree. But then he 'll say, " I, as an artist, can see how beautiful a flower is. But you, as a scientist, take it all apart and it becomes dull. " I think he 's kind of nutty. <p>... Although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. But, at the same time, I see much more in the flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and other processes. There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I do n't understand how it subtracts.( 27-28) <p> I told the students that both Richard and the artist could be right and that I wanted to know how they felt. <p> One student spoke up. " Well, ever since you told us why the sky is blue, whenever I walk around outside and see the sky, it seems better, prettier because I know why now. " <p> " You know, " said another, " I hated science before chemistry. " <p> Someone in the back of the room muttered, " I still hate science. But now, wherever I look, I think about class -- what we talk about and stuff like that. " <p> " What do you mean by that? " I asked. <p> Another student responded for him. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world more interesting. You know, now when I take a bath, since I know how soap works, I think how interesting it is that there is a reason why soap cleans up dirt. Before, I would just take a bath and not even think about anything. It did n't seem special. Now it seems, well, you know, unique. Knowing that there are reasons for things makes me wonder about other things. Chemistry makes the world come alive for me. " <p> Another student, one who consistently scored 100 percent on tests, disagreed. " Oh, well, science certainly makes you appreciate the world more. That I agree with. But it does n't make it more beautiful. " <p> " Why? " I asked. <p> " When I was little and looked at a rainbow, I used to think how beautiful that rainbow was -- how exciting it was that there was a pot of gold at the end. It was magical. Now all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refracted light. Whoopee, " she stated somewhat dejectedly. <p> " So, what you 're saying is that science diminishes beauty, " I continued. <p> She responded, " It does n't necessarily diminish it. You just look less at what something looks like and more at why it is. I know that sounds silly. " <p> " It is n't silly, " I responded. " You know, there 's something to be said for simplicity, and when you start looking at things scientifically, you do n't see the beauty as much. " <p> Another student entered the discussion. " Science complicates things so much that you are no longer able to see the beauty in things. I agree with the artist. When my mother points to a flower and mentions how beautiful it is, all I can think of are the different names for the different parts of the plant, all the stuff I had to memorize for tests. " <p> I asked him if there was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or interesting to him. <p> " No, I ca n't think of anything, " he answered. <p> " Nothing at all? " I inquired. <p> " Hm, " he started. " I suppose that I liked learning about the gas laws. You know, why food takes longer to cook in the mountains and stuff like that. I told my mom how a pressure cooker cooks the beans so fast. That was interesting. She told me to buy her one. " <p> The discussion continued for some time with the slant of perspectives shifting back and forth. Probably, because of the subtle, yet manipulative, game I play as teacher, more of the students tended to believe that science and aesthetics are compatible with one another. The final consensus was that whether science does or does not make the world more beautiful, it certainly helps a person appreciate it more. A Dialogue With Chemistry <p> Another device to help students " see " the aesthetic side of science is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If chemistry could speak, what would it say of itself? " The students in our classes discovered that taking some time even to write down a page or two of dialogue led them to insights about science, especially regarding its holistic nature. As one student said, " Chemistry class is not only about chemistry. It is about the way things are, about the whole of things. " This is what we call an aesthetic aspect of chemistry. What follows is a dialogue with " chemistry " that one student wrote. <p> CHEMISTRY : often feel little understood. It seems students do n't especially like me -- that, for most students, chemistry is the mere repetition of facts filled in by a few experiments. <p> STUDENT : It sounds like you are hurt and sad. <p> CHEMISTRY : Yes. In fact, did you know that some people are talking about me as they do my friend mathematics? They think I 'm a mental disorder, a phobia of some kind. <p> STUDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of anxiety for many students? <p> CHEMISTRY : It 's sad that you think difficulty is related to anxiety. Are n't things which are difficult, which are new, worth doing? Literature, who is really my brother and sister, is difficult for many students to learn. But, I 've never heard of anyone talking about literature phobia, as they do about mathematics and me. <p> STUDENT : That 's a good point. But, why do you say literature is your brother and sister? Are n't you and literature completely different? I mean you deal with facts and experiments, and literature deals with characters, plots, etc. <p> CHEMISTRY : Well, I look at literature and myself as games. In literature, it 's sometimes hide and seek, trying to find the thread that connects events in the story. Are n't games fun? They may be difficult to learn, but the fun and cooperation one finds through many games make their pursuit worthwhile. <p> STUDENT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHEMISTRY : YOU do n't mean to tell me your teacher has you do me alone, in private, do you? I 'm more like dancing than jogging. And partners are needed for dancing. <p> STUDENT : How are you like dancing? <p> CHEMISTRY : I have a rhythm, that is, I relate to all that is. I 'm like the waves of an ocean, belonging to the vast sea, able to be separated from it when someone watches a single wave, as when a student concentrates on a particular chemical, but always going back into the vast expanse of sea. I 'm a part of everything, like numbers and shapes. I constitute all that is. I create harmony and integration and feel saddened that that which is a part of me, some students do n't appreciate. Are people afraid of the waves? No. They might be frightened by the sea, but not when they approach the sea wave by wave. The same with me. If students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but can see and appreciate me in everything, in their daily lives, how I help people, like watching the wave calms people down, maybe they will begin to see me as a friend, too. <p> STUDENT : Thanks, Chemistry. I 'll share our little talk with the class. You sure gave me a different view of you than I previously had. I 'll be talking to you again, soon. <p> CHEMISTRY : I 'll look forward to it. <p> As the class discussed the various dialogues, we all became aware of apparently hidden dimensions of chemistry, especially aesthetic dimensions like " appreciation, " " harmony, " and " integration. " This exercise left many of us with a new wonder and excitement about chemistry. Reflection <p> Coles( 1990) notes that even though he attempts to let students discuss a particular issue or concept without evaluating, "... yet even so, I, the listening physician, anxious to order things, grabbed for conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Perhaps this is the occupational hazard of ethnographic researchers. Yet, the intent of the above types of dialogue( as with Coles 's research) is to be a learner among learners. Through the above dialogues, we see that students develop values perspectives, especially aesthetic values, in chemistry class. There is more going on than the learning of content. <p> We also realized that the teacher may find it difficult, if not impossible, to avoid manipulating a class discussion. But, if teachers are aware of their influence( in a values sense of science versus aesthetics), they can choose either to consciously share their values perspectives or to minimize their hidden, often subtle, agendas. The issue, then, is : How do teachers avoid manipulating students? How do teachers provide students with the opportunity for self-reflection and values discovery and disclosure? <p> The teaching style that avoids manipulation( as much as this is possible to avoid) we call " the art of being consciously nonaggressive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students feel confident enough to speak openly about issues. Amazingly enough, however, something about this conscious nonaggression forces the student to internal self-reflection without being judged by the teacher. In other words, conscious nonaggression makes the students feel comfortable about discussing issues in class, but, at the same time, something about the method makes students reflect upon their answers and recognize when their answers are less than fully formed. All this occurs without creating either fear or a negative sense of self. <p> One could still ask, " What is the value of the above sorts of dialogue? No generalizable conclusions were reached. " Coles( 1990) notes that children ask " the eternal questions... more intensely, unremittingly, and subtly than we sometimes imagine "( 37). The above kind of exchange affords students the opportunity to ask such questions in a legitimate, dialogical environment. To not offer such an opportunity may be to make an idol out of content. As John Dewey( 1944) argued, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than facts and information. Education embraces processes for integrating and broadening subject matter. <p> Likewise, many teachers wonder about the kind of " real " influence that they have on students, especially on those depressing days when nothing seems to go right. As Robert Fulgrum( 1988) notes, wisdom is not a high priority even in graduate school. To us, wisdom is, among other things, the ability to examine, cognitively and affectively, the relationship, if any, between science and aesthetics. That is, wisdom consists of perceiving value interrelationships -- seeing the subject differently, as from another point of view. Perhaps if wisdom( interrelating disciplines, for example) were pursued more in public schools, it would become a part of the graduate school agenda. <p> The most important aspect of the above sorts of dialogue is self-knowledge. Our students were encouraged to express their opinions without criticism. The teacher acted as a guide, a facilitator : a questioner among questioners. Education is a life-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration -- discovering parts of oneself one did not know existed. <p> The students in the chemistry class all had opinions about the relationship between science and aesthetics, but we wonder if they all knew they did. And, we wonder what they learned about themselves when they clarified the question. Perhaps some learned that the artist and the scientist are on similar quests. Perhaps others learned that there was an aesthetic, appreciative side to themselves that they hardly knew they valued. Perhaps still others learned that they could appreciate themselves( as they could appreciate the flower) without overly analyzing themselves. And perhaps other students realized the need to look at themselves through analytical lenses. <p> Coles( 1990) refers to education as a " march through life "( 335) : <p> So it is we connect with one another, move in and out of another 's lives, teach, heal, and affirm one another, across space and time -- all of us wanderers, adventurers, stragglers and ramblers, sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pilgrims.... Yet how young we are when we start wondering about it all.( 335) <p> Dialogues like the above make pilgrims and wonderers out of us all. Such journeys bring revelations, in cognitive, affective, and values senses. Yet a journey demands taking steps. The destination needs to be somewhere. We suggest " conscious nonaggression " as a framework by which to permit the trip. The rest of the adventure will be, willingly, freely, taken by the students. Is this art or science? The reader needs to journey, too. <p>
