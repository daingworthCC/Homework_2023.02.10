4070041 DEEP IN THE LIBYAN Desert, 125 miles west of Luxor, lies Kharga, Egypt 's largest oasis. The North Kharga Oasis Survey( NKOS), of which I am codirector, has established that this remote area -- more than 100 miles long and from 12 to 60 miles wide -was continuously occupied throughout Egyptian history. We now know that it is home to an extraordinary variety of sites, including prehistoric rock art, Neolithic encampments, pharaonic monuments and burials, Roman settlements and water-supply systems, and the stars of the oasis -- five unique Roman forts that guarded this part of the empire 's southernmost frontier. Newly discovered ancient graffiti has even provided the name of a previously unknown ruler, King Aa, in power around 3000 B.C., who sent an expedition to this remote area. The NKOS 's results are also changing our understanding of ancient Egypt 's connections with its neighbors. We can now show that Kharga played an important role in trade between Egypt and other parts of Africa, from the Old Kingdom up through the modern period. <p> Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oasis, a depression in the desert that in the distant past was a large body of water that shrank over time, leaving smaller lakes and an easily tapped underground water supply. While a French team has been investigating the oasis 's southern part for the past 20 years, the north remained an enigma. Then, in the winter of 1998 Corinna Rossi, of the College of Milan, went to Kharga on vacation and saw several astonishing Roman forts, which were, for the most part, undocumented. The following year, she and I met in Cairo and, over coffee, discussed the use of aerial photography and balloons to explore the vast area. We soon became friends and in 2000 established the NKOS. The project 's goal is to survey the entire northern part of the oasis -- close to 2,000 square miles -- and locate new archaeological sites. Because of the area 's enormous size, we use a variety of methods such as kite aerial photography, satellite imagery, and field-walking. Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GPS, map and photograph it, draw the buildings, gather and study the pottery and small finds, and collect archaeobotanical and archaeozoological samples for later study. <p> Although not now as verdant as in antiquity, since much of the water supply has disappeared, the Kharga Oasis was a rich agricultural center that produced wheat and barley, and several varieties of dates, grapes, and other fruits and vegetables. Kharga 's wine was exported throughout the ancient world, particularly from the 26th Dynasty( 664-525B.C.) onward. Alas, wine is no longer produced there. The oasis was also known for its mineral resources, including alum, an ingredient in mummification, medicines, tanning, and dyeing, and ochers, used in paint and cosmetics. A text found in Luxor from the time of King Rameses II( ca. 1298-1296 B.C.) lists some of this mineral wealth as being sent from Kharga into the Nile Valley. <p> Apart from its rich soils, Kharga 's other chief asset was its location -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dakhla Oasis that lies west of Kharga to the Nile Valley. These oases may have offered an alternative to the Nile route to Nubia and other parts of Africa for travelers, traders, and smugglers ; provided more freedom of movement ; united remote areas of Egypt with the Nile Valley ; and granted access to a wealth of trade goods from other regions. For example, the walls of the Egyptian explorer Harkhuf 's( ca. 2279-2181 B.C.) tomb records taking the " oasis route " to an as-yet-unidentified land in Africa and bringing back a dancing pygmy to play with seven-year-old King Pepi( 2290-2196 B.C.). We now think the route he took was an extension of the routes that connected the Kharga Oasis to the Dakhla Oasis. By the Roman era, the track through Kharga to Darfur became a well-known trade route for the transport of grain, gold, camels, ebony, ivory, and slaves along what is now called the Darb el-Arbain, or Forty Days Road, for the time it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced portions of this ancient route. <p> Today about 90,000 people live in Kharga. Most are oblivious to the ancient monuments, although a few are happy to have tourist attractions that boost the local economy. Although the NKOS has covered a lot of ground, a great deal remains unexplored. Our work is crucial since the population is growing, and agricultural activity, in the form of enormous new watermelon plantations, is encroaching on archaeological sites. Sites here also suffer from antiquities thieves and vandals. Convinced that the ancients had buried gold under the floor, robbers driving a front-end loader almost completely destroyed a temple at Umm el-Dabadib in 2004 before we had a chance to discover its date or the deity to whom it was dedicated. Other thieves have attempted to steal petroglyphs, damaging many in the process. <p> Frequent sandstorms, high winds, extreme temperatures, and poisonous snakes make working in Kharga challenging. But I never know what is behind the next sand dune. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely built over an earlier pharaonic one. The oasis 's Roman forts are found at the north, south, east, and west limits of the oasis, often near water supplies. Unlike others in the Roman world, they are made of mud brick, not stone. A walkway on top allowed soldiers to survey the surrounding area. The primary function of the forts was probably not defense as their walls are, for the most part, only one brick thick. However, especially from a distance, their massive appearance conjures up the might of the Roman Empire, so the facades must have deterred nomadic attackers while the forts performed their real function -- administration of the empire 's southern limits. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : North Kharga Oasis Survey( NKOS) co-director Corinna Rossi( left) and I uncover a rock-art panel dating to about 3700 B.C. depicting giraffes, elephants, and humans, with later drawings of cattle. On the same milelong rock surface, the NKOS has discovered panels featuring animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They date to an era when the Sahara was greener and could support more animals. The people who carved the petroglyphs either lived here as hunter-gatherers or traveled through the territory. We also found evidence for an ancient lake nearby, which is probably why this was an attractive stopping place over the centuries. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : The NKOS has identified several small Neolithic( 7000-3500 B.C.) encampments, complete with grinding stones( left) for making flour ; stone tools, including scrapers, blades, pounders, and awls ; fragments of bone tools ; and ostrich eggshells that were used as containers and to make beads. Although some evidence of Kharga 's history was recorded by the prehistorian Gertrude Caton-Thompson in the 1930s, we were surprised by the number of Neolithic sites we found. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : I have a passion for animal mummies, so I was excited to discover that the temple of Ain Dabashiya was associated with animal cults, particularly that of the canine-headed god Anubis. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. Temple, we found a tomb containing a group of dog mummies, and a similar deposit less than half-a-mile away. Here Corinna and I examine some of the dog mummy skeletons that have sustained wind and sand erosion, causing the loss of their mummy wrappings. The deposit contains the remains of several hundred dogs, ranging from few-week-old puppies to adults, possibly bred in the area. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Until the NKOS 's work, people thought the structure at Muhammed Tulaib, below, was a fort. But the architectural style and a piece of inscribed plaster telling of its dedication to a form of the god Horus identified it as a temple dating from the second century B.C. to first century A.D. Later( we are still trying to establish precisely when), the temple was expanded to include an administrative area. Surrounding it is evidence of large fertilized wheat fields dating from the second century B.C., industrial areas for producing pottery and textiles, and a cemetery that contained graves belonging to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : At Umm el-Dabadib and elsewhere in the oasis, neatly laid-out Roman settlements surround the forts. A particularly interesting feature of some of the houses across the oasis is a main public room enhanced by two niches -- one in the pharaonic style decorated with a cornice on top and edged by a molding( seen at the center in the photo at left) and the other in a more classical style with an arch supported by pillars( on the right wall). Each niche likely contained a statue, although none have been found yet. Given that the houses date to a period of transition from paganism to Christianity, it is tempting to think that the houses ' inhabitants were hedging their bets and that one niche contained an image of an Egyptian deity, and the other a Christian one. This idea is supported by the existence of both a temple and a church at the site. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Corinna Rossi examines the ancient conduits that took water from the underground aqueducts at Umm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qanats, were probably first introduced by the Persians in the sixth century B.C., and later lengthened by the Romans. The qanats made Kharga extremely productive. We have located and mapped several qanats across the Kharga Oasis. At Umm el-Dabadib, we explored the qanat 's underground tunnels, learning how it felt to be an ancient worker who had to walk hunched over to avoid snakes. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : El-Deir is the largest of five Roman forts in the Western Desert and the one closest to the terminus of several routes that lead to Kharga from the Nile Valley. In this form, the structure dates from the third to the fifth centuries A.D. Throughout its existence, it probably held the largest number of troops in Kharga. During World War I, the fort was used by British soldiers who made a new gate and stayed inside, leaving a lot of graffiti like names, ranks, and hometowns. The cliffs in the background contain tombs dating from the fourth century B.C. to the fifth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with evidence of ancient cultivated fields, a temple, and a settlement contemporary with the fort. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : An unusual feature of several fort complexes are pigeon towers, which may also have existed at other locations in the Kharga and Dakhla oases. The birds were eaten and their guano used as fertilizer. Some of the birds may even have been used as carriers, an early example of a pigeon post. Here architect Nicholas Warner records the oasis 's best-preserved tower at Ain el-Dabashiya. Because of its vulnerability to wind and soil erosion, we chose it as NKOS 's first restoration project. <p> By Salima Ikram <p> PHOTOGRAPHS BY Ken Garrett <p> Salima Ikram is a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo and co-director of the North Kharga Oasis Survey.
