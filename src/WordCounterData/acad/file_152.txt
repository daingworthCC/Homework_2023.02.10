4020741 The growing scholarly interest in an interdisciplinary approach to studying the past has produced a new understanding of the British Atlantic economy, particularly coastal Carolina, where the rice crop ranked alongside the sugar of the West Indies, tobacco of the Chesapeake, and the cod of New England. For the past quarter century, there has been a steady stream of works defining South Carolina 's place within a world where a distinct plantation economy and society had emerged well before the American Revolution. Considerably less attention has been paid to placing colonial Georgia within that same context. Although there have been excellent biographies, careful essays on the world of slaves and women, renewed consideration of Indian life, and continuing work on political development, Georgia 's role in the trans-Atlantic economy has received less notice. In particular, how did its merchant community take shape? What were its sources of capital? How did merchants invest their funds? And how did that community differ from that in South Carolina, where the rice and indigo trade had given rise to an indigenous merchant class with deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of confidence that made it willing to face down the British lion?( n1) <p> By the late 1760s, Georgia 's merchants included five distinct yet overlapping groups : men who came out of the Trustee period, those from Charleston or with a Carolina connection, a small number arriving directly from England, an even smaller number of Protestant Irish who figured prominently in the Indian trade and, finally, ambitious Scots, coming directly from their homeland, the West Indies, or other colonies in North America. In the development of South Carolina 's merchant community, Scotsmen had played a critical role, especially in the early and middle years of the colony. By the 1760s, however, the Scots were only one element, albeit an important one, among a group that drew on Huguenots, New England sea captains, Sephardic Jews, Dutch, and English. In Georgia, it was otherwise. The Scots dominated the economy in a way they never had in the neighboring province, and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trustee period, whether Lowlanders, who had brought indentured servants and led the fight to introduce slavery, or the war-like Highlanders who came with James Oglethorpe to found the military community of Darien. Both Lowlanders and Highlanders faded from view as distinct groups after the late 1740s, although many individuals rose to positions of prominence during the royal period.( n2) <p> Something else occurred that has attracted little attention -- the arrival after 1750 of a number of Scots who put a distinct stamp on colonial Georgia and provided much of the direction for its economic development. They were not as visible as earlier groups, for they came as individuals or families, and their impact was more financial and economic than political or cultural. Despite their low profile, they brought an aggressive entrepreneurial spirit, solid commercial know-how, precious access to capital overseas, invaluable ties with merchant houses in the British Isles and the West Indies, and on occasion much-needed professional training. The new Scots who eventually dominated the merchant community in Savannah, Sunbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial planters throughout the colony, acquired political power far beyond their numbers, and showed a clannishness that gave them unusual staying power. Instrumental in tying Georgia to the trans-Atlantic community in the early 1760s, these merchants stood at the heart of two rich ironies. First, they were to play a critical role in the creation of a highly stratified society in coastal Georgia, facilitating the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. At the same time, they played a central role in creating opportunities for middle-class planters, traders, and artisans, and brought about a surprising degree of social mobility even on the coast. The comparative absence of class tension in colonial Georgia owed much to the success of their activities. Second, they were to prove staunch defenders of the British imperial system while introducing an aggressive form of capitalism that ultimately undermined that same system. <p> In the late 1740s, Georgia held little interest for merchants with its impoverished population, few viable farms, a prohibition on slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trustees in London. Once slavery began in 1750 and the announcement made that a royal government would be created, interested onlookers took heart. Carolina planters surged across the Savannah River to obtain rich rice lands and led the effort to create a plantation-based economy modeled after that of South Carolina. In response, the fledgling merchant community attracted a different kind of individual. In January 1753, only five or six men in Savannah arguably merited the title of merchant( those engaged in imports and exports and able to provide a degree of credit) ; perhaps another dozen were shopkeepers. By the end of the year, there were as many as eleven or twelve men who could claim the title. The person who had virtually created the profession, James Habersham, began to back away from the daily routine of business to concentrate on his rice plantations and political role, leaving ample space for others.( n3) <p> Of the newcomers in that transitional year, Scots arrived in the largest numbers. They became the entrepreneurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag the backward frontier settlement into the burgeoning trans-Atlantic economy. Their reasons were varied. Lewis Johnston felt the closing of opportunity on St. Kitts Island, perched on the elbow of the vastly rich Windward Islands in the West Indies, where chances for success had diminished except for the incredibly wealthy. Former surgeon in the royal navy and married to the daughter of a merchant, he brought thirty to forty slaves, a number that put him among the colony 's largest owners, and went on to practice medicine, operate a plantation, and lead what was, for a time, the largest trading firm in the colony. By way of contrast, the twenty-one-year-old Robert Baillie needed a way out of financial difficulties. His father had sent him to Jamaica to try his hand in commerce. When that venture failed, he considered going to Central America or India but chose Georgia because of debts owed him there. His new venture lasted only a matter of months. About the same time a thirty-five-year-old Scot, John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry goods and an impressive array of connections. Son of a Presbyterian minister, he had experience trading in the West Indies and enjoyed financial backing from a relative, David Graeme, and his partner, Richard Oswald, one of the most powerful of the Scottish " Associates " trading in London. Young Baillie closed his store, became a planter, and bought his first two enslaved Africans from Graham.( n4) <p> Although Georgia 's economy gathered momentum slowly during the 1750s, Scottish merchants continued to drift into the province. Their timing was serendipitous. While other colonies struggled through an extended depression after the Seven Years ' War, which ended in 1763, Georgia experienced a dramatic increase in population, production, and shipping. During the last fifteen years of British rule the number of whites tripled ; that of blacks more than tripled ; the value of exports rose dramatically from 20,852 to 121,677, and the ships clearing port soared from 37 to 217.( n5) <p> At the heart of that boom stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three principal towns of the colony : Savannah, Sunbury, and Augusta. Of the twenty-four firms or individuals who advertised in the Georgia Gazette in 1768 and merit the classification of " merchant, " perhaps twelve came from Scotland. Of the three largest export firms in Savannah, all were in the hands of Scotsmen : John Graham and Company, long a fixture on the Bay, the street closest to the Savannah River ; Cowper, Telfairs, created in 1766, and an overnight success ; and Gordon, Netherclift, a branch of a Charleston firm heavily vested in the Indian trade. Below this tier were four firms with access to London capital, all with Scottish connections : Read and Mossman ; George Baillie and Company ; Samuel Douglass and Company ; and Inglis and Hall.( n6) To the south of Savannah, Scots controlled even more decisively the trade coming out of Sunbury, which served a large rice-growing region based on a network of rivers. In the previous decade, an Englishman, James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had gone bankrupt, turned his affairs over to John Graham, and fled to the safety of Williamsburg, Virginia. In his place came a firm composed of a trio of North Britons, and alongside their establishment two other partnerships, Darling and Munro, and Spalding and Mackay( then Spalding and Kelsall), with offices in Sunbury, Frederica, and Savannah.( n7) <p> Augusta presented a more complex picture. Although it attracted settlers on their way to lands opened by the treaty of 1763, this frontier town remained dominated by the trade with Creek Indians. The merchants represented a breed apart, a rougher cut of men accustomed to purchasing their strouds, duffels, guns, and powder in Charleston, sending out packhorse trains to Indian villages, empowering their traders to negotiate prices for deerskins, sometimes honestly, often less so. The Old Guard of traders -- Scotch Irish, Anglo Irish, Scotsmen, and Englishmen -- had long maintained a monopoly of sorts, imposing common prices and policies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted by death as well as the moves to Savannah of entrepreneurs such as Lachlan McGillivray and John Rae for life on a grander scale. Although the Old Guard continued to hold sway, they now faced a new set of men who energized a trade that had lost much of its former profitability. Scotsman Robert Mackay came from Jamaica by way of Charleston and formed an alliance with one of the old-line companies. A fellow countryman, Andrew McLean, shipped out his first trains of packhorses in mid-1765, and became one of the principal suppliers of skins to John Graham and Company in partnership with a talented Englishman, James Jackson, who had arrived earlier.( n8) <p> For Georgia as a whole, the Scots provided the one missing element, direct access to the markets of London. While most setters came from relatively humble upbringings or were Carolina planters with a decidedly local outlook, these men sprang from backgrounds that opened doors throughout the Atlantic world. The governor once described John Graham to the London Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Lordships, " and indeed his role as correspondent of the powerful Richard Oswald gave him a unique standing. Of the firm of Cowper, Telfairs, newcomer Basil Cowper had originally come to Georgia to supervise the investments of his uncle, a London merchant of Scottish origins who pumped considerable sums into coastal land. James Spalding, heavily involved in the Indian trade, was a relative of the owner of the largest flax-spinning mill in Scotland. John Gordon, merchant of Charleston and Savannah, seems to have been a relative of Lord Adam Gordon, who played a key role in funneling investments of the high and mighty of Britain into East Florida. And even the more modest came from mercantile backgrounds. Robert Baillie 's father and uncle were businessmen in Edinburgh. Contrary to appearances, the loose network of Scottish merchants manning the new British Empire was a close-knit, almost familial affair.( n9) <p> This handful of men provided the capital that funded Georgia 's economic development. By any measure, the sums obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish, owed their counterparts in the mother country at least 261,000, and that sum understates the actual value. Some British firms had made direct investments ; for example, Greenwood and Higginson created a model plantation on Ursla Island, a few miles west of Savannah, that was cultivated by one hundred Africans. After the Revolution, London merchants claimed pre-war debts owed by Georgians at 247,781, a figure that included interest of 99,000. That number placed the colony fifth out of the twelve for which figures exist. Ironically, the province, whose very existence seemed in question as late as the 1740s, received a disproportionately generous inflow of funds from some of the shrewdest minds operating in the trans-Atlantic world in the 1760s and early 1770s. Clearly, the London elite who plotted financial strategy in Nicholas Lane, Lombard Street, and Old Bethlem saw Georgia as the next South Carolina and were willing to make the necessary investments. The colony 's debt amounted to 41 percent of South Carolina 's, an extraordinary figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms, 11.4 of debt per white person in Georgia versus 7.4 in South Carolina.( n10) The figures gain added importance from the fact that, by the end of the colonial period, South Carolina generated internally the bulk of the capital used in its development. The assets of local merchants, private individuals, and charitable societies provided the greater part of funds through an active and well-financed mortgage market. With Georgia still young and dependent on the mother country, the reverse was true. Entrepreneurs generated some capital internally and from South Carolina, but the vast majority came from Britain itself, specifically a small number of merchants and traders in London.( n11) <p> The working relationships that developed between Savannah and London came about in response to specific opportunities. In 1762, John Graham decided to expand his operation, especially in the Indian trade. He entered into partnership with John Clark, a London merchant with Scottish connections who had long been a leading player in the Carolina rice trade. Graham simultaneously brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the premier Indian traders in Georgia. McGillivray was a larger-than-life personality. Resident in an Upper Creek town, he had taken an Indian wife, became partner in a firm that monopolized the Indian business in Augusta, and served as adviser to governors in two provinces. He was shrewd, ambitious, and with a keen desire to turn himself into a Savannah gentleman. He had recently moved to the city and purchased one of the nearby river plantations. The new London firm of McGillivray, Grahams, Clark operated with a one-quarter interest held by McGillivray, one-quarter controlled by John Clark, and one-half interest in the hands of brothers John and James Graham. James Graham moved to London to handle the business end of matters but, before leaving Georgia, solidified the firm 's position in the Indian trade by marrying the daughter of the Scotsman who served as superintendent of Indian affairs for the southern department. It was a powerful combination.( n12) <p> From the middle of the 1760s onward, the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Started as a place that would be free of the social evils of other American colonies, the province ended by adopting the institution as " the one thing needful " to insure economic growth. The colony achieved a positive sense of self based on the prosperity engendered by the work of thousands of Africans. Scottish merchants stood in the forefront of the slave trade. In the fifteen years between 1750 and 1764, they had played a role in importing a modest number of slaves, some 637 from the West Indies and 1,238 transshipped from South Carolina, hardly enough to sustain a rapid expansion in the cultivation of rice. John Graham, Lewis Johnston, and others had brought small numbers of " seasoned " slaves into Georgia, those who had been " broken in " on sugar plantations in the Caribbean, typically no more than half a dozen at a time given the thinness of the market. Many came from St. Kitts, where the long-standing ties of the Scots provided a special connection.( n13) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and in 1766 the first shipments arrived directly from Africa. In the decade before the Revolution, local merchants presided over the sale of 7,950 bondsmen. The firm of Cowper, Telfairs led the way with fifteen cargoes or slightly more than two shipments a year on average, followed by Inglis and Hall, John Graham and Company, George Baillie and Company, Clay and Habersham and Company, and smaller vents by new merchants like the Scottish firm of Moore and Panton. The enterprise of Cowper, Telfairs enjoyed a meteoric rise. Opening its doors in 1766, it was the largest business in the province seven years later. William Telfair, former agent of a Scottish tobacco firm in Virginia, had come to Savannah some time before, attempted to set up in the Indian trade, and established a partnership with one of the more prominent local merchants. In 1766, his younger brother, Edward, joined him. He had also started as a storekeeper in Virginia, had worked in North Carolina, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " indicating a search for connections and status in the Caribbean. The two met Basil Cowper, who appeared in Georgia to handle the investments of his uncle, a Scottish merchant in the Carolina trade. Cowper was young, had adapted to life as a favored nephew, and joined Gov. James Wright 's squad of forty gentlemen and seamen who walked the streets of Savannah in early 1766 to enforce the writ of the Stamp Act. He brought his uncle 's financial backing to the partnership and a certain social standing. The Telfairs added business acumen and a voracious appetite for dominating the market.( n14) <p> The London branch may have done business under the name Telfair, Cowper, Telfair, but it followed Savannah 's lead. A future governor of Georgia, Edward Telfair had an unerring eye for assessing risks. In August 1773, the Guinea ship Francis made a late arrival from Senegal with 115 slaves for the account of Governor Wright, the English subminister William Knox, and John Graham. Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the shipment off their hands on condition of handling the sale on a strictly commission basis. " We would not have engaged in this adventure had it not been that some of our considerable planters would have been drawn from the House had they gone into the hands of any other Merchants here as this is the first cargo imported this year, " he told William Thomson. In fact, he split the sale with another Scottish merchant, found one planter willing to buy forty of their number, and disposed of the total for a noteworthy 4,850, despite the fact that the shipment contained the weak and vulnerable, young boys and girls, several invalids, and men and women too old to be productive in the fields. This defensive step paid off. The house captured the market for export that year, sending 12,000 of goods to England, more than any other partnership.( n15) <p> If slavery was crucial to the prosperity of even the average Georgian, the Scots could claim a fair share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Charles Town did not reproduce at a sufficient rate to maintain their population, much less generate a natural increase. The imbalance of sexes, the harsh conditions on the isolated plantations, and the newness of Africans adjusting to a strange environment meant that any growth in numbers came from imports alone and, indeed, the available statistics suggest a net decrease of more than two thousand enslaved Africans. That one fact elevated the status of a Basil Cowper or Edward Telfair significantly. When a planter went into the slave pens of Savannah, he knew this was his best and perhaps only chance to expand his workforce. <p> Rice exports for Georgia were the most visible symbol of the impact of an expanded black population. By the end of the colonial period, the Telfairs, Grahams, Baillies, Mossmans, Reads, Douglasses, Spaldings, Munros, and Darlings, together with a handful of others, provided various services that permitted them to ship 23,540 barrels of rice by 1772. They sent schooners upriver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and established the weight of each, arranged for drayage and storage in Savannah, obtained needed insurance and clearance papers, found space on vessels in the port, and worked with their agents in London to obtain the best price in the best market. In 1765, eleven ships cleared Savannah and Sunbury for Britain. All were British bottoms, save one. Several local merchants pooled their funds, purchased a topsail ship, and sailed it into the Atlantic in a declaration of commercial independence. The " Georgia Packet " left on July 11, bound for " Cowes and the markets, " loaded with 833 barrels of rice and several hogsheads of deerskin. The owners were prominent in the mercantile community : John and James Graham, Lachlan McGillivray, James Read, James Mossman, Alexander Fyffe, Joseph Clay, James Habersham, Jr., together with John Clark of London and the sea captain ; seven of the ten were Scottish. That declaration of commercial independence was more symbolic than real. In 1772, twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two owned in the province.( n16) <p> By enabling rice production to expand so rapidly, the Scots facilitated the growth of a highly stratified society with a few families at the top. They extended credit to those planters who could afford the heavy costs of an efficiently run plantation : a work force of forty or more slaves, mastery of a sophisticated technology, and ample capital. The knowledgeable William DeBrahm estimated the cost of an average-sized rice plantation at 2,476 sterling, and this may have been an understatement, at least for a rice plantation using the tidal flow method, where the powerful tides coursing up a river could be harnessed to drive fresh water onto the fields at critical moments. Edward Telfairs 's accounts show individuals on the books for debts of more than one thousand pounds, most likely planters purchasing field hands. The reality, though, is that few Georgia planters employed the tidal flow method. It was too expensive, too complicated, and too new. Most, whether big or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, first brought by Carolina planters along the Medway, Ogeechee, and Newport rivers, in which rice was grown in fresh-water river swamps with a simple irrigation system. Planters built a bank at the top and bottom of each field and constructed an impoundment pond above the field in order to release fresh water as needed.( n17) <p> Entrepreneurs to the core, the merchants of Savannah knew where their long-term interests lay and became the leaders in adopting the tidal flow method, the most advanced technology employed in any industry, with its complex hydraulic landscape of banks, trunks, reservoirs, canals, floodgates, and ditches. Nowhere could they have faced a greater challenge than on the Savannah River. For the first thirty to thirty-five years of the colony 's existence, planters scarcely tapped the rich marshlands of that river for rice production, because of the difficulty in mastering the treacherous currents that washed through the marshy lowlands. To read the history of those estates in Mary Granger 's classic book, Savannah River Plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land speculation, cutting of timber along the banks, sale after sale in an effort to turn a profit or escape a crushing financial burden. The year 1762 proved a turning point. Three Scotsmen, John Gordon, Grey Elliott, and John Mullyrne, purchased a tract on Hutchinson Island, which had previously sold for a few shillings per acre. James Graham followed suit and developed Rice Hope Plantation alongside theirs, with 202 acres, a work force of almost sixty slaves, and an output of 250 barrels of rice and more than two thousand pounds of indigo. Lachlan McGillivray also invested in two large tracts on that island. The price per acre soared to more than 10 sterling, perhaps the most expensive land in the colony.( n18) Along the banks of the Savannah River extending twelve miles westward, Scottish merchants dotted the landscape with their newly acquired estates. McGillivray planted at the ambitiously named Vale Royal, Basil Cowper on acreage that had once been part of the Musgrove Cowpen. Samuel Douglass took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " and described it as " the best tide swamp in the highest state of cultivation, " capable of producing three hundred barrels of rice. Further upriver, John Graham shifted his resources to Mulberry Grove, where he added land and acquired slaves.( n19) Carolina planters were the dominant element in developing the Ogeechee, Newport, and Medway rivers, but Scottish merchants played that role on the Savannah River. <p> While advocating the tidal flow method, the Scots nevertheless put considerable cash, goods, and services into the hands of those using the older, less efficient impoundment method ; this group included small planters, men of the middle class, and even the lower-middle class. The traditional image of the rapid accumulation of land in the hands of a wealthy few telescopes what was a much more involved process, oversimplifying a complex development. Trying to dam fresh water above a rice field was not efficient. Although planters ran the risk of damage by flooding or drought, the impoundment method did allow smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending credit to a broad range of rice planters, the Scottish merchants ironically promoted a degree of social mobility. Planters using the impoundment method may have been as small as Michael Burghaller, a German in St. Matthew 's Parish who, when he died, had six enslaved Africans, a crop of unthreshed rice, three rice mills, mortars and flails, and four sieves for rice. In the barn were five barrels of clean rice, worth 8 sterling. Or, more typically, there was James Pierce, illiterate as was his wife, but his holdings included fourteen Africans -- seven males and seven females -- together with the equipment needed for rice production, 110 head of cattle, fifty hogs, many bushels of Indian corn, and some lumber. Valued at 793 sterling, the estate was by no means inconsiderable. What gave value to their efforts were the merchants of Savannah and Sunbury, eager to do business. In 1764, Edward Summer of St. John 's Parish sold eight barrels of rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cow and calf, and twenty hogs in Sunbury for 25 sterling, an amount sufficient to keep him operating for another year. In 1769, Edward Telfair purchased six barrels of rice for 11 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence from one small planter and 453 bushels of corn from an illiterate farmer for the handsome sum of 45. These business dealings may have figured on the margin of what the larger merchants engaged in, but they pumped precious credit and pounds sterling into the hands of modest folk on the coast.( n20) <p> The merchants also extended credit to craftsmen, artisans, and small shopkeepers, seeking out men moving up the economic ladder. The firm of Cowper, Telfairs granted a loan of 249 to Thomas Blount, carpenter of Savannah ; 90 to a distiller of Savannah ; 39 to a tailor ; and 300 pounds sterling to a local tavern keeper. Adrien Loyer came to Savannah as a silversmith and combined that trade with clocksmithing. At the beginning of the decade, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he had acquired a significant amount of land and boasted of twelve slaves. On the eve of the Revolution, the books of Spalding and Kelsall showed debts carried by some 260 individuals, most of them in St. John 's and St. Andrew 's parishes, Liberty and McIntosh counties today. The number of large planters in those two areas could not have been more than sixty people, suggesting that credit went to a broadly representative group. When these smaller planters, artisans, and tavern keepers walked into the stores in Savannah or Sunbury, they commanded respect and attention for they could make the difference in a selling season.( n21) <p> If the Scots of Savannah were successful in the commerce in rice, they succeeded even more rapidly in the trade with natives, albeit briefly. The export of deerskins had long been an important source of revenue on the southeast coast. For most of the eighteenth century, leather manufacturers in England turned deerskin into a wonderfully light, porous, and tough product that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckskin breeches enjoyed a fashionable elegance for a brief while and retained a long-term market with those possessing more modest budgets and who appreciated its durability. Until mid-century, deerskins represented the second most valuable commodity for South Carolina after rice. Georgia sat on the sidelines, although most of the hunting took place on its frontier and the skins passed through Augusta on their way to Charleston. By the beginning of the 1760s, Savannah had made gains, and a merchant like John Graham used his position to stake out a claim on the increasing trade. After the Revolution, a Scottish colleague recalled : " Knew Claimant from 1761. He was then in a great way of Mercantile Business. His business was chiefly in the Indian trade. Being worth 5 or 6,000 sterling at that time would be esteemed being a Man of Fortune. " The following year, John Graham established the partnership that brought together one of the most prominent Indian traders in Georgia, Lachlan McGillivray, a leading merchant of London, John Clark, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had improved by 1759. In that year, the leading Indian merchant of Charleston, John Gordon, opened an office in Savannah, purchased a wharf lot, and put Thomas Netherclift, the son-in-law of his former partner, in charge. As a young man, Gordon had emigrated from Scotland to Frederica, where he supplied Oglethorpe 's Regiment during King George 's War( 1740-1748) and, when the regiment disbanded, moved to South Carolina. He picked a good time for his return. The end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 removed the Spanish and French threat from the southeast ; the Creeks and Cherokees had nowhere else to turn for supplies, and the profit margins were high. The total trade in goods, according to a report submitted by Governor Wright to London, amounted to 23,961 sterling of British goods sold to the natives, compared to an estimated 11,500 in Georgia 's rice exports. If most of those goods passed through Charleston, an increasing amount came Savannah 's way. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transshipping the merchandise ; the Augusta storekeeper placed a 20 percent markup ; and the traders who actually carried the goods into the Indian territory added 30 percent in recognition of the proportionately greater dangers from packhorses dying on the trail, theft, and unpaid debts. Well over half of Georgia 's end of that trade ultimately passed through the hands of either Graham or Gordon.( n23) <p> Over the next few years, the volume of trade in deerskins soared, from 42,000 pounds in 1762 to 308,000 six years later and, although it settled to something over 200,000 thereafter, the economics of the business turned against Savannah 's merchants. The seeds of the problem lay in the Proclamation of 1763, intended to protect the natives of North America as well as the Indian trade itself from encroachment. Not only did settlers accumulate a strong sense of grievance at a measure designed to exclude them from native lands, but the proclamation opened that trade to any man who put up a small bond and obtained a license. From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier became a competitive flee-for-all with desperate and inexperienced men, the dregs of colonial society, rushing in with disastrous consequences. A surplus of goods flooded Indian towns as they sought to make a quick fortune ; debts increased, while prices fell, often below cost, and creditors frequently went unpaid.( n24) As seen in Table 3, Savannah 's merchants did not proportionately benefit from the resulting expansion. West Florida exploded onto the scene to drain away increased production and cause anticipated revenues to shrivel even further, while Charleston stubbornly held its own. <p> By the eve of the Revolution, matters had reached a crisis at each level of the credit pyramid. The flow of merchandise from Britain -- guns, lead, powder, duffels, strouds, pots, knives, and other prized goods -- kept coming through the well-established pipeline that started in the manufacturing centers of Great Britain. That pipeline passed through London and Bristol, on to Savannah and Charleston, and from there to Augusta, Frederica, and Mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The day of reckoning was at hand. James Jackson and Company of Augusta, the second-largest Indian trader in Georgia with twenty employees fanning out principally to the Upper Creek towns, owed John Graham some 19,400, while Spalding and Kelsall owed 9,000. Graham in turn was indebted to John Clark of London for those sums and more. In response, merchants put pressure on their traders for a greater volume of deerskins as the international market approached saturation. Hunters killed younger deer ; herds thinned to dangerous levels ; and the Creeks and Cherokees became increasingly unable to fulfill their obligations to pay for British goods. By 1773, they owed the equivalent of 670,000 pounds of deerskins.( n25) <p> Forced by necessity, the merchants of Augusta and Savannah grasped at a way out of their impasse -- canceling the debt of Cherokees and Creeks in return for possession of at least two million acres of Indian land north of Augusta, the rich, fertile soil coveted by land-hungry settlers coming into the state from North Carolina, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare the illegality of the transaction, he saw the advantages of convincing the British government to approve a modified version. The Creeks and Cherokees would surrender the land north of Augusta to the Crown in return for cancellation of all their debts. The government would sell the land to eager settlers and use the proceeds to repay the merchants for the amounts owed. Governor Wright appointed Andrew Robertson and Alexander Wylly, one an Indian merchant, the other a former Indian merchant, to verify accounts submitted by their colleagues, and named John Graham as collector of monies from the sales. Even had the sales taken place, it is unlikely that the scheme would have resolved the financial impasse. These merchants were still on the hook to their London creditors for dry goods worth considerably more than what they would have received. James Jackson and Andrew McLean owed John Graham, and eventually John Clark of London, some 19,000 against a certificate issued by the governor of Georgia for 9,963, to be redeemed by the sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) <p> The Treaty of 1773 that ratified the exchange of land for cancellation of debt had seemed an ideal way to merge the conflicting interests of land-hungry settlers with the economic concerns of merchants who defended Native Americans and their hunting grounds.( n27) That hope quickly dissolved. When a band of renegade Creeks attacked two settlements in December of that year, leaving nine men, one woman, and four children dead, Governor Wright imposed an embargo on all trade. It was a potent tactic, as long as the principal merchants cooperated in the ban. Several did not. James Spalding of Frederica sent gunpowder, guns, and balls to his stores on the St. John 's River in East Florida and another shipment to the Lower Creek towns, where it was reported " that the Indians were flocking from all Quarters to Purchase the above goods, And that they had sold Seventeen Barrels of Rum in a few days. " Backcountry settlers were indignant at this proof of duplicity and the threat it posed to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove successful, and the Creek headmen executed two of the offenders in exemplary fashion. In the fall of 1774, the settlers expected the governor to extract what they considered the minimum demand, the cession of the prized strip of land between the Ogeechee and Oconee rivers. Instead, Wright chose to bring peace to the frontier by siding with the Indian traders -- the Grahams, Baillies, McLeans, Mackays, Jacksons, Galphins, and Griersons -- and restoring relations with the headmen of the towns, whose prominent standing within their own communities depended on a steady supply of goods. A leading authority on colonial Georgia, historian Edward J. Cashin, calls that moment the turning point on the frontier, the instant when backcountry settlers, so supportive of the British government for protection against the Indians, reassessed their loyalty and began to look elsewhere for leadership, notably the emerging spokesmen of revolution in Georgia. That moment sealed the final divorce between Indian traders and inhabitants of the backcountry.( n29) <p> To what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the upcountry, become part of the newly emerging society within the colony as a whole? A recent study of British policy and the southern frontier makes a case that the Scots involved in the Indian trade, and that included most of the merchants in Georgia, never fully assimilated into local society within the southeast, either on the coast or in the interior. Native white Americans not only regarded them with traditional English prejudice but also resented their overnight economic and political success, their access to overseas capital, and their close ties to British officials. For South Carolina, these arguments carry weight. That colony had been in existence since 1670 ; a native elite enjoyed deep roots and considerable prosperity, and resentment of Scottish merchants was endemic. For Georgia however, the term " outsider, " at least in terms of social and economic realities, applies less well. The colony was too young to have a native-born elite, and many Scots who arrived in the Trustee period occupied secure and honored places within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sir Patrick Houstoun, named to the original Royal Council in Georgia and advisor to three governors, eventually became political figures. Others were dominant landowners in their parish, like Capt. Mark Carr, who founded the port of Sunbury. The Scottish town of Darien produced Lachlan McIntosh, son of the original leader of that Highland community and a dominant figure in the landowning elite of south Georgia. To these could be added the Scots who migrated from South Carolina like James Bulloch and his family or James and Audley Maxwell, names that commanded respect and attention throughout the colony.( n30) <p> The new Scots who came to Georgia after 1750 faced a greater challenge, for they lived in towns, not the countryside, pursued a profession that did not arouse the same feelings as a planter or army officer, and kept more to their own. Of twenty Scottish merchants who married in Georgia during the colonial period and for whom records can be found, fourteen stayed within their community. Of that number, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planter who moved his family from St. Kitts in the mid-1750s, and provided a rallying point for the West Indian interests. John Graham wed Frances, and Alexander Wylly married Susannah. Edmond Tannatt took Elizabeth, and George Baillie, a Scottish merchant who moved from Charleston to Savannah, chose Jourdina. When Tannatt died an early death, his widow married yet another Scottish merchant, James Mossman. Perhaps the most notable family portrait to come out of colonial Georgia captures the Crooke and Tannatt families and their in-laws ; the group is seated on the gracious, spreading lawn of a family plantation. Their dress is elegant ; the pose was aristocratic ; a sense of worldly success and familial well-being permeates the scene, with its fishing rods, live oak trees, and plantation house in the background, all bespeaking an ease that seems far away from the hustle of the mercantile world that made this conspicuous display of wealth possible. The elegant painting disguised well the origins of James Mossman in a counting house.( n31) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully thought-out way. Although Edward and William Telfair both married late, they had their eye firmly fixed on becoming part of the emerging colonial elite. At age forty, William wed Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Bellinger, a wealthy landowner in South Carolina, and a man who bore the exalted title of landgrave, a carryover from the days of the Proprietors. His brother married the daughter of William Gibbons, also a wealthy South Carolina planter who had moved his considerable holdings of slaves across the river to profit from the newly opened rice lands. Thirty-nine years old with a bride of sixteen, Edward intended to make a bid for power and connections. Yet, to all appearances, it was a happy marriage, producing nine children and a family name that still echoes in Savannah today.( n32) <p> Socially, the new Scots made their way with apparent ease. Shortly after their arrival, the Graham brothers joined Solomon 's Lodge, the recently reconstituted Freemasons of Georgia. Three other compatriots belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and became the second Provincial Grand Master of Georgia. The Highlander Lachlan McGillivray, despite his Creek wife, moved with consummate ease in the circles of other planters and merchants who traveled about in phaetons and riding chairs, dressed in silk breeches and raced horses. As his biographer pointed out, McGillivray above all epitomized the social revolution taking place in Georgia, the rise of men of checkered background into the ranks of Savannah " gentlemen. " The more public events ratified these developments. When a grand jury convened for Christ Church Parish in 1769, seven of the twelve men were merchants, five of them Scots. Even where the Scots seemed distinctive, their institutions melded with the established order of things. The members of Independent Presbyterian Church included virtually the whole of the Scottish community in Savannah, but the church had been established by Jonathan Bryan, William Gibbons, and James Edward Powell, as good a slice of the English colonial elite as to be found. When the Scots founded a revitalized St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed. The columns of the Georgia Gazette carried letters expressing concern at the spirit of exclusivity and clannishness of the new organization, fearful it would promote a dreaded " factionalism " in a relatively open society. But the club opened its doors to non-Scots for its annual St. Andrew 's dinner, and prominent Georgians like James Habersham joined in the partying.( n33) <p> Politically, the Scots moved into positions of leadership early. In 1755, two years after arriving, Lewis Johnson entered the Commons House of Assembly, the first legislative body in the colony 's history. Two years later, the governor appointed John Graham to be Clerk of the Accounts as well as Indian Commissary. Their influence was immediately visible. When the mechanics of Savannah demanded the Commons House of Assembly prevent growing competition of black artisans with white craftsmen, the West Indian lobby( John Graham, Lewis Johnston, Alexander Wylly, a Scotch-Irish partner of Johnston from Tobago, and Edmond Tannatt, who came from St. Kitts) organized a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In effect, the Scotsmen lately of St. Kitts, Tobago, and London intervened in the most decisive moment of class tension in colonial Georgia, helping deliver a mere shell of a law to the frustrated " mechanicks. "( n34) In 1760, Scots represented eight of the twenty-one members of the Commons House of Assembly and, in subsequent elections, the number varied from five to seven. In each of the elections of 1768 and 1772, four Scottish merchants returned to office. Where they most stood out, however, was on His Majesty 's Council, advisory body to the governor and upper house of the legislature. By 1765, its twelve members included John Graham of John Graham and Company, Lewis Johnston, of Johnston and Wylly, Grey Elliott of Gordon and Elliott, and James Read, partner in Read and Mossman. Also on the council were two other Scotsmen, James Mackay and Clement Martin, still a part-time resident of St. Kitt 's. As late as 1775, five of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scots had integrated well into the social order that had emerged by the time of the Revolution, a certain ambiguity underlay their presence. John Graham, one of the three most important figures in the colony, enjoyed an almost unbroken record of success in his twenty-two-year residence, and yet his ambition was to emulate the sugar barons of the West Indies. " Be as it will, I am fully determined to remain where I am till I can leave it on a proper footing, " he confided to his fellow Scotsman, Gov. James Grant, " for I must find myself in a situation to spend from 1,000 pounds to 1,500 a year in England, before I will show my face there, and when my plantations will afford this, I wo n't stay a month longer. " And therein lay the rub. If few of the Scots shared his intention of becoming an absentee owner, they remained connected to British society, tied to the trans-Atlantic world through the flow of capital and goods, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and privileges. As the political crisis between North America and Britain worsened, they increasingly derived their sense of identity from these connections and by the time of the Revolution defined themselves in ways that made them " outsiders " to increasing numbers of Georgians.( n36) <p> The Stamp Act Crisis of 1765 was the defining moment when the new Scots began to assess their loyalties. When the enforcement of the act began on November 1, most stamp distributors had already resigned or left the colonies ; ships sailed without stamped papers and colonial governors looked on helplessly. By early 1766, the refusal of American colonists to buy stamped paper had effectively nullified the will of the British government, with one lone exception, the port of Savannah. In January 1766, its merchants committed the unthinkable and purchased the detested stamps to send their cargoes on their way. When the governor closed the port in early December, these eager traders petitioned to find someone who would serve as temporary stamp distributor ; the official one was en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America. During the last two weeks of December, Savannah witnessed the slightly comical sight of its men of commerce knocking on doors to recruit a person willing to incur the prevalent anger and brave enough to risk the lawsuits that might follow. On January 3, the actual distributor arrived at Tybee Island, and in a few days the port reopened and the stranded vessels sailed. In the face of popular anger, James Wright smuggled the despised distributor out of town and into hiding on Robert Baillie 's plantation in south Georgia, an act that was to cost Baillie his seat in the assembly. When furious Americans threatened to destroy the house of the chief justice, an especially obnoxious Scotsman by the name of William Simpson, some sixty to seventy compatriots, including merchants, surrounded his place with muskets at the ready.( n37) <p> In the wake of the crisis, the merchants learned a valuable lesson, that of maintaining a discreet silence in the face of the political firestorms that were to sweep the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia 's colonial assembly, and the repressive measures that followed the Boston Tea Party. They kept their heads down, fully immersed in the business of taking advantage of the boom conditions that still prevailed. Those merchants, and most especially the Scots, were blind to the gathering political storm and filled their correspondence with pleas to their London agents to keep the supply line furnished with choice goods. " We are fearful of any delay in the delivery of goods and merchandise, " Edward Telfair told his partners. " We hope to have in the next month some 2000 pounds upon the seas, " and warned the house would lose customers if the cargo did not arrive. By the eve of the Revolution, the London merchants had become uneasy at the dangerous overextension of their partners in Georgia. Still, until mid-1775, London as well as Savannah did its best to keep that supply line filled.( n38) <p> Concerned their investment in the Indian trade had gone sour, the Scots had already begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1770s, this meant moving aggressively into land acquisition, internalizing that basic American instinct for speculation and investment. John Graham left off being a merchant to concentrate more exclusively on land as the vehicle for wealth, becoming the largest proprietor in Georgia with some 26,000 acres. Samuel Douglass, correspondent for one of the great London houses, went from very little holdings at the beginning of the decade to 16,000 acres. James Spalding and Roger Kelsall purchased for their company more than 8,000 acres, primarily in St. John 's Parish. The records of land grants and purchases by the Scots showed no signs of slowing down in 1774 and early 1775, even with news of the Battle of Lexington and the slide of the royal government into oblivion. Simply put, the hardheaded Scots believed that sustained economic growth had become a permanent feature of the landscape.( n39) They did not seem overly concerned by the massive debt they had accumulated with their London correspondents either. In 1790, that amount stood at 144,000, with accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony fifth on the list of the most indebted. But in 1776, that number was a staggering 261,337, with the firm of Cowper, Telfairs owing 76,937, John Graham and Company, 69,644, and Samuel Douglass, together with Gordon and Netherclift, at least 61,185. The year 1775 found the Scottish merchants in a virtually impossible situation ; they had become political outsiders and financially vulnerable.( n40) <p> Despite this exposure, these hard-boiled merchants were to stand firm in defense of the Crown, even at the cost of their fortunes. When the Continental Congress imposed a blockade on exports, Savannah 's merchants paid little heed and continued to sell rice to East Florida and beyond. When a British fleet off Tybee Island demanded provisions of rice in February 1776, they openly committed themselves to the Crown 's forces in the mock-heroic " Battle of the Rice Boats. " On March 3, the British seized control of a fleet of rice boats next to Hutchinson Island. Many of Savannah 's merchants, Scots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result, the exodus of Scottish merchants began. Lachlan McGillivray, James Read, John Simpson, John Graham, and John Taylor left for Britain, East Florida, and Jamaica. Others retreated to their plantations, as Samuel Douglass later phrased it, " to protect my property and be able to pay off my debts in England. " In June, the president of Georgia addressed the Provincial Congress on the need to arrest those " whose going at large is dangerous to the liberties of America, " and that number included an impressive list of Scottish merchants still present : James Spalding, James Mossman, Samuel Douglass, John Inglis, David Douglass, Thomas Netherclift, George Kincaid, Thomas Reid, Robert Reid, and George Baillie.( n41) <p> When the British marched back into Savannah in December 1778, many of the Scots returned to resume their business and several played a notable role in the restored government : John Graham as lieutenant governor, Lewis Johnston and William Telfair, commissioners of the bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Basil Cowper, Samuel Douglass, John Simpson, James Mossman, William Panton, Alexander Wylly, Simon Munro, James Spalding, George Baillie, and Robert Baillie, and elected but not serving, Andrew McLean and James Grierson. Of His Majesty 's initial council, three of the seven members were Scots : John Graham, Lewis Johnston, and Martin Jollie. Those in the assembly took a role in drawing up the Disqualifying Act, depriving 152 Georgians of their civic rights, and a later act that banished twenty-four individuals while confiscating their property. As if to pour salt in the wounds, the Scots led the charge in purchasing tracts of land attached for failure to pay debt, especially Basil Cowper and Samuel Douglass, who added considerably to their holdings.( n42) <p> On August 15, a month after the fall of Savannah, the legislature of the State of Georgia passed a remarkable piece of legislation : " And Whereas the People of Scotland have in General Manifested a decided inimicality to the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continue a Ruinous War, for the purpose of Subjugating this and the other Confederated States. Be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid that no person a native of Scotland shall be permitted or allowed to emigrate sic into this state with intent to settle within the same or to carry on commerce or other trade, profession or business. " Cooler heads repealed the law, but the point was taken. The men who made up the Scottish merchant community in colonial Georgia departed, most for East Florida.( n43) <p> The new Scots, men who came after the mid-century mark, disappeared with such finality that historians have ignored their role, and yet their work tells much about the nature of colonial Georgia. Historians have justifiably made much of the " Carolinization " that took place in Georgia after 1750 as Carolina planters moved onto the coast, bringing with them enslaved Africans and the plantation system that exploited them. The role of the Scots suggests this interpretation needs to be broadened. First, the Scots dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in South Carolina. They operated on a small stage and, to a large extent, controlled who walked on and off of that stage. It is only a bit too strong to say that commerce was a Scottish family affair. At Charleston, there were more native merchants than in Virginia and Maryland because business conditions were more like those in Philadelphia and New York. Georgia closely resembled Virginia, where Scotsmen operated small stores along the network of rivers. Yet it differed from Virginia in that three or four firms in Savannah controlled the bulk of the funds flowing into the colony, determining where the money was to go and under what conditions it was offered.( n44) <p> The Scots faced an economy that posed the kinds of challenges Carolina had faced fifty years before. They confronted a slave population that could not yet reproduce itself, rice cultivation done by the relatively inefficient impoundment method, and a heavy dependence on the British government in the Indian trade. They skillfully took advantage of those facts. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported British goods that tied Georgia to the commercial revolution, made rice exports the focal point for supporting the credits granted by London, took away from Charleston leadership in the Indian trade, and developed a costly new technology for rice plantations along the Savannah River. Of course, they made their share of mistakes. They clung to the Indian trade long after most Carolinians had moved on to more lucrative avenues. Commerce with the Creeks and Cherokees was the dark shadow that hung over an otherwise flourishing economy, the root cause of the alienation of the backcountry from Georgia 's economic leaders. <p> In their eagerness to promote financial development and reap the benefits of increased trade, the Scots lent money to a surprisingly broad range of people. Certainly they pushed for the concentration of rice land along the coast into the hands of a wealthy few. John Graham and Samuel Douglass were themselves spectacular examples of that process. But the limited evidence suggests the middle-class planter, with ten or so acres of rice and eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitively using the inland swamp method, and found a good market for his crop. They also advanced funds to tavern keepers, shopkeepers, artisans, shipbuilders, sea captains, and farmers who produced the Indian corn and peas that fed the West Indies. The combination of these two phenomena was to create that irresistible sense of optimism and self-worth that dominated the last years of the colonial period. <p> Scholar Jack Greene remarked that Georgians had a genius for going against history : first the utopian vision of the Trustees, then a government constructed to maximize the power of London, and finally, the warm embrace of slavery, bucking larger currents in Western history. The sad truth was that slavery did hold the key to fortune in the lowcountry and not just for the wealthy. As many as half of the households in the lowcountry held slaves, and many more colonists sought to gain the status that came with slave ownership. Historians routinely note the marked social inequalities along the coast, but detect relatively minor manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension during the period 1760-1775. The work of these Scots in spreading the wealth to a goodly segment of society was a significant part of the explanation.( n45) <p> Politics interrupted the normal flow of events, and these men were quick to declare their loyalty to the system that nurtured them, the great trans-Atlantic economy that tied continents together in a giant exchange of goods and services for the mutual benefit of a surprisingly broad group of people. Again, unlike their peers to the north, they had toed the line of imperial policy, rarely challenging the misguided policies of successive ministries, following the rules regarding clearance papers and other bureaucratic minutiae, and refraining from the time-honored tradition of smuggling. It was ironic that their success in narrowly pursuing an aggressive capitalism ultimately helped undermine the imperial system. <p> The insiders of yesteryear quickly became the outsiders by 1776. Their role in the Battle of the Rice Boats eliminated them from political life in Georgia and led to the exodus of many, if not most. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their doom in the eyes of many colonists, leading to their peremptory exclusion in the days following the creation of the state. The tragedy of their abrupt departure was that it left a gaping hole in the economic and social life of the new state. Capital, commercial expertise, invaluable connections disappeared in the blink of an eye, a much heavier legacy for Savannah to bear than for Charleston, where no such wholesale turnover occurred. The ensuing vacuum was a major factor in the realignment of power after the Revolution, with the upcountry claiming its due. In a not-so-subtle revenge, Augusta and the surrounding counties, Richmond, Wilkes, and Burke, stripped Savannah of political, and to a certain extent, economic power. The irony was that the leading Scottish merchant of colonial times, the nimble Edward Telfair, one of the few mercantile Scots to embrace the Revolution, transferred his base of operations to the upcountry and assisted his new colleagues in measures against the town that had nourished his early success.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers, the contributions of early Scottish entrepreneurs to Georgia 's colonial history fell by the wayside of history.
