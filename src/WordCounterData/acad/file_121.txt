4017541 ADVANCED ENERGY SYSTEMS <p> Commercial power plants are in service using vapor-dominated and liquid-dominated geothermal power. Meanwhile, research and development continues on hot dry rock resources. <p> GEOTHERMAL ENERGY IS a naturally occurring renewable source of thermal energy. Thermal energy within the earth approaches the surface in many different geologic formations : volcanic eruptions, geysers, fumaroles, and mud pots. <p> Generating electric power from geothermal resources began in earnest in 1960 and is ongoing. Today, the capacity of geothermal power plants worldwide exceeds 6000 megawatts.( The table on page 78 lists the installed capacity by country.) <p> The thermal energy in geothermal fluids is absorbed from the surrounding geologic formations over a period of time. When the rate of energy extraction to generate electric power exceeds the natural recharge rate, energy production from the reservoir declines. <p> The rate of decline is related to the energy extraction rate and the natural recharge rate. Many factors influence the natural recharge rate, including the amount of fluid in the reservoir, the inflow of cold water from external sources, and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like other power plants, the design of a geothermal power plant is based on a specific set of flow, pressure, and temperature conditions. Although resource decline begins as soon as production starts, the power plant is initially insulated from the decline by resource temperatures and pressures that start out above the conditions used for the power plant design. As time and production continue, the resource flow conditions fall to, and then fall below the power plant design conditions. <p> The decline of resource flow conditions can usually be delayed by adding production wells and reworking existing wells. These techniques, however, provide decreasing benefit as the resource matures. Many geothermal power plants that have been in operation for a number of years are operating at reduced capacity because the resource has matured and is declining. <p> For reasons ranging from contract issues to tradition, the potential variations in the geothermal energy sources were not included in the original design of these power plants. By necessity, existing plants are being modified to respond to changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be described as hydrothermal, hot dry rock, or geopressured. Hydrothermal resources contain hot water, steam, or a mixture of water and steam. Hot dry rock resources, as the name implies, do not have fluids that can transport the energy away from the high-temperature subsurface rock. Geopressured resources contain hot fluids under higher-than-normal pressures. <p> Although research and development projects continue to look for ways to efficiently extract and use the energy contained in hot dry rock and geopressured resources, virtually all current geothermal power plants operate on hydrothermal resources. <p> The characteristics of the hydrothermal resource determine the power cycle of the geothermal power plant. A resource that produces dry steam uses a direct steam cycle. A power plant for a liquid-dominated resource with a temperature above 330 degrees F typically uses a flash steam cycle. For liquid-dominated resources with temperatures below 330 degrees F, a binary cycle is the best choice for power generation. Power plants on liquid-dominated resources often benefit from combined cycles, using both flash and binary energy-conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for existing geothermal power plants are continuously improved to suit the changing resource conditions. The improvements described here for the different power cycles reflect probable design trends for the next generation of geothermal power plants. DIRECT STEAM CYCLE <p> Figure 1 shows a direct steam cycle. The cycle diagram shows the major components that are used to generate electric power and are influenced by changing resource conditions. Impacts on the turbine, condenser, gas-removal system, and cooling tower will be described herein, along with modifications that respond to the changing resource conditions. <p> The direct steam cycle is typical of power plants at the Geysers in northern California, the largest geothermal field in the world. The primary operator of the Geysers is Pacific Gas and Electric ; other participating utilities include Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Northern California Power Agency, Central California Power Agency, and independent power plants run by Santa Fe Geothermal and Calpine. Steam from geothermal production wells is delivered to the power plants through steam-gathering pipelines. The wells can be a mile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to supply steam to the power plant varies with the geothermal resource and the size of the power plant. A 55-megawatt power plant in the Geysers receives steam from between 8 and 23 production wells. These wells range from 6000 to 10,000 feet deep. <p> In a direct steam cycle power plant, a geothermal turbine must operate with steam that is far from pure. Chemicals and compounds in solid, liquid, and gaseous phases are transported with the steam to the power plant. At the power plant the steam passes through a separator that removes water droplets and particulates before it is delivered to the steam turbine. The turbines are of conventional design with special materials, such as 12Cr steel and precipitation-hardened stainless steel, and design enhancements, such as using stainless-steel inserts for erosion protection in the casings and improved dram systems, to improve reliability in geothermal service. <p> Turbine rotors, blades, and diaphragms operate in a wet, corrosive, and erosive environment. High-alloy steels, stainless steels, and titanium improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corrosive nature of the condensate require effective moisture-removal techniques for the later stages of the turbine. Scale formation on rotating and stationary parts of the turbine also frequently occurs. Water washing of the turbine at low load operation is used between major overhauls to remove scale. <p> As the supply pressure to the turbine declines, the turbine accepts less and less flow, resulting in diminished power generation. When the supply pressure falls to approximately half of the original design conditions, some capacity may be restored by removing the first-stage blades from the turbine. Future power generation can be evaluated, and the timing for this modification can be established using turbine and power plant performance data and resource deliverability curves. <p> Resource deliverability curves relate flow, pressure, and time to project future production capability. The shape and slope of the curves vary from resource to resource. Overlaying performance curves for the modified turbine on the deliverability curves will show whether the increase in resource production at a lower pressure will offset the reduction in energy-conversion efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been effective for a number of plants in the Geysers. <p> The next component of interest is the condenser. Both direct contact and surface condensers have been used in direct steam geothermal power plants. Until the late 1970s direct contact condensers were used to condense turbine exhaust steam. These condensers were tailored to the geothermal power cycle because of their economic and performance benefits. Environmental concerns and increasing geothermal development led to the use of surface condensers in conjunction with noncondensable gas-treatment systems to control the release of hydrogen sulfide, which is one of the many compounds found in geothermal steam. <p> Surface condensers in geothermal service are subject to fouling on both sides of the tubes. Power plants in the Geysers have conservative cleanliness factors to account for the expected fouling. Some plants have installed on-line tube-cleaning systems to combat the fouling on a continuous basis, whereas other plants mechanically clean the condenser tubes when necessary to rectify lost performance. <p> The noncondensable gas-removal system for a geothermal power plant is substantially larger than the same system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam from the geothermal resource. The gas, primarily carbon dioxide, contains lesser amounts of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, nitrogen, and other gases. The total noncondensable gas content can range from 0.1 to more than 5 percent of the steam. The makeup and quantity of noncondensable gas varies not only from resource to resource but from well to well within a resource. <p> The equipment that removes and compresses the non-condensable gas from the condenser is one of the largest consumers of auxiliary power in the facility, requiring approximately 6 percent of the steam that is delivered to the power plant. A typical system uses two stages of compression. The first stage is a steam jet ejector. The second is another steam jet ejector, a liquid ring vacuum pump, or a centrifugal compressor ; the choice of second stage is primarily a function of the amount of gas to be compressed. <p> Changes in the resource are usually accompanied by changes in the noncondensable gas flow. Typically power plants must modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system uses a large amount of auxiliary power, the modifications are also directed toward improving the efficiency of the gas-removal system. <p> Early plant designs used two stages of steam jet ejectors. Each stage had either two 50 percent capacity or one 100 percent capacity jet element. When modifying the gas-removal system for changing conditions, multiple jet elements of varying sizes are frequently selected to provide improved efficiency over a wide range of noncondensable gas flows. At many plants, the second-stage ejectors are being replaced by liquid ring vacuum pumps to reduce energy consumption and improve flexibility. <p> The last component of the power generation systems is the cooling tower. The cooling tower is a multicell wet mechanical draft design. Water is circulated from the cooling tower basin to the condenser and back to the cooling tower by centrifugal pumps. A parallel stream serves plant auxiliary coolers, including the gas-removal system and the turbine generator. Cooling is accomplished primarily by evaporation. Water that is lost from the cooling system to evaporation and drift is replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the geothermal resource in an injection well. <p> Thus far, existing cooling towers have not required modification or upgrade to accommodate declining steam production. Even when the turbine has been modified for a greater-than-design flow at a lower inlet pressure, modifying the cooling towers to keep pace with the increased heat duty has not been necessary. FLASH STEAM, BINARY, AND COMBINED CYCLES <p> A flash steam cycle for a high-temperature liquid dominated resource is shown in Figure 2. This dual-flash cycle is typical of most larger flash steam geothermal power plants. Single-flash cycles are frequently selected for smaller facilities. <p> Geothermal brine or a mixture of brine and steam is delivered to a flash vessel at the power plant by either natural circulation or pumps in the production wells. At the entrance to the flash vessel, the pressure is reduced to produce flash steam. The steam is delivered to the high-pressure inlet to the turbine. The remaining brine drains to another flash vessel where the pressure is again reduced to produce low-pressure flash steam, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The liquid-dominated resources that serve flash steam power plants do not produce hydrogen sulfide in quantities that require controls similar to those used at direct steam plants. This allows the use of a direct contact condenser in the flash steam cycle. Cooling for the flash steam cycle uses a multicell wet mechanical draft cooling tower. Water lost to evaporation and drift is replaced by steam condensate. Excess water and spent brine from the flash vessels are injected back into the geothermal resource. <p> Flash steam plants are faced with potential corrosion and erosion damage similar to direct steam plants. Similar materials are used, but each geothermal resource must be evaluated individually for corrosion-causing chemicals and compounds. <p> A decline in energy production for a flash steam plant requires modifications similar to those used in direct steam plants. Resource deliverability curves form the basis for developing the most beneficial modifications to the turbine. Removal of the first-stage blades alters the distribution of high- and low-pressure steam to the turbine and changes the flow-versus-pressure performance of the turbine. <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the noncondensable gas that is present in the geothermal fluid. These changes may require modifying the gas-removal system as described for the direct steam plants to handle more gas or a wide range of gas flows. <p> A binary cycle is the economic choice for hydrothermal resources with temperatures below approximately 330 degrees F. A binary cycle uses a secondary heat transfer fluid instead of steam in the power generation equipment. A typical binary cycle is shown in Figure 3. This type of cycle can be used to generate electric power from resources with temperatures as low as 250 degrees F. Geothermal resources with temperatures below 250 degrees F have been used directly for district heating systems and greenhouses. <p> The cycle shown in Figure 3 uses isobutane as the binary heat transfer fluid. This cycle is representative of units with capacities of approximately 10 megawatts. Many small modular units with capacities of 1 or 2 megawatts use pentane as the binary fluid. Heat from geothermal brine vaporizes the binary fluid in the brine heat exchanger. The spent brine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the binary fluid vapor drives a turbine generator. The turbine exhaust vapor is delivered to an air-cooled condenser, where the vapor is condensed. Liquid binary fluid drams to an accumulator vessel before being pumped back to the brine heat exchangers to repeat the cycle. The brine heat exchangers are typically shell-and-tube units fabricated from carbon steel. However, some geothermal fluids may require special materials such as stainless steel or titanium for the tubes to resist corrosion. Turbines for binary fluid vapor are smaller and less expensive than a geothermal steam turbine of similar capacity. However, the higher cost of the auxiliary equipment for a binary plant eliminates the cost advantage. <p> Binary geothermal plants have been in service for less than 10 years. The inevitable resource decline has yet to significantly affect these facilities. When it occurs, a likely first response will be to modify the composition of the binary fluid to reestablish a match between the new resource conditions and the existing power generation equipment. <p> Combustion-based power plants have achieved improved efficiencies using combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Power plants are now being designed using a combination steam cycle and binary cycle to extract more useful energy from the geothermal resource. Existing steam cycle plants are being modified with a binary bottoming cycle to improve efficiency. This cycle is one of many that can be used for a geothermal power plant. The cycle-selection process includes consideration of resource production capability and conditions, ambient conditions, and, for an existing facility, the existing power cycle. THE FUTURE OF GEOTHERMAL POWER <p> Geothermal power plants have historically been designed without consideration of potential resource variations or changes. The next generation of geothermal power plants will be designed using long-term projections for resource production as the basis for cycle selection, optimization, and system design. Equipment and system design will be capable of flexible operation to respond -- with minimal modification -- to anticipated resource changes over the life of the facility. <p> Power generation and gas-removal equipment will be designed either to operate efficiently over the entire range of conditions or to support planned modifications at intermediate conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design of the power plant, power generation systems will efficiently use the variable resource production to generate the maximum possible electric power from the geothermal resource. <p> Significant geothermal reserves exist in many parts of the world. It is estimated that in the United States alone there is the potential for 23,000 megawatts of electric power generation for 30 years from recoverable hydrothermal geothermal energy. Undiscovered reserves may significantly add to this total. Many of the known resources can be developed with today 's technology to generate electric power and for various direct uses including in greenhouses or heating buildings. For other reserves, technical breakthroughs are necessary before this naturally occurring energy source can be fully developed. <p> Power generation from geothermal energy is cost-competitive with most combustion-based power generation technologies. In a broader picture, geothermal power generation offers additional benefits to society by producing significantly less carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour than combustion-based technologies. <p> Worldwide Geothermal Capacity PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> DIAGRAM : Figure 1.
