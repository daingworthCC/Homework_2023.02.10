4119041 Based on NAEP data, many adolescents may not be adequately prepared for postsecondary education. This is a Year Five report from a seven-year longitudinal study of a student cohort starting in sixth grade year( n=50). It uses a quasi-experimental design, and collects data from surveys, interviews, and reflective statements to evaluate mentoring strategies and outcomes. Year Five findings suggest that improvements in students ' college perceptions, state mandated test scores, and high school perseverance may be associated with mentor-led initiatives including college visits, goal setting, tutoring, career investigations, role model presentations, writing projects, and presentations about college preparation and life. </p> Reports on the educational attainment of adults and on the college readiness of adolescents provide disturbing news, particularly regarding African-Americans and Hispanic students. Recent data about high school graduation rates indicate that nationally, about 71 percent of all students graduate from high school on time with a regular diploma, but barely half of African-American and Hispanic students earn diplomas with their peers( Sum, 2009). Each year approximately 1.2 million students fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are categorized as in minority groups( Diplomas Count, 2009). Students who drop out of high school may have a grim economic future. According to Swanson( 2003) only one-third( 37 percent) of high school dropouts nationwide are steadily employed, and they are more than twice as likely to live in poverty. </p> Trends in college readiness education attainment among adolescents are discouraging. Recent NAEP academic achievement reports( National Assessment Governing Board, n.d.) indicate only small percentages of eighth graders rank within the ' at or above proficient ' category for various subject areas and a significant gap exists so that Hispanic and African-American groups underachieve when compared to other population groups. The reading, math, and science NAEP scores of young adolescents and the current drop-out rates force the question : how many wiII be ready for college in four years? Overall the gap in education preparation among Whites, Hispanics, and Blacks, as evident in their scaled scores, will result in many minority students being poorly prepared for higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITERATURE The need to begin preparation for post-secondary education during middle school has been recognized for a long time, funded nationally, and supported at state and local levels. The literature includes articles, handbooks and guidelines for this process, and calls to action in the case of minority and underserved populations. </p> PLANNING TRANSITION FOR COLLEGE STARTING IN THE MIDDLE GRADES </p> The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program( GEAR UP) was created in 1998 and provides college-planning activities and related information to students, typically starting in middle school, and helps build relationships among school districts, colleges, and other community stakeholders. Based on site visits to 20 GEAR UP partnerships and descriptive information from 1 8 schools, Muraskin( 2003) reported that tutoring was the most common type of support. In their " Year 4 " baseline report, conducted in north-central West Virginia, Finch and Cowley( 2003 b) summarized that tenth graders ' postsecondary plans had been positively influenced by the GEAR UP program. </p> The Federal TRIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared similar academic preparation goals with GEAR UP. TRIO, originally named this because it offered three programs, now includes eight outreach and support programs designed to help low-income, first-generation college students and students who have disabilities, progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs. </p> Predating GEAR UP are many state and locally funded programs such as Michigan 's Project Awareness and Baltimore 's Early Guidance Model. Flores( 1993) reported that the goal of this Michigan program was to heighten students ' post-secondary aspirations through five interventions. Baltimore City Schools ' Early Guidance Model( Gray, 1986) for middle/junior high school students supported this early post-secondary planning goal and extended it to elementary level students, suggesting that at an early age children need academic encouragement and need to envision going to college. Calls to action concerning the educational needs of minority and underserved populations have been raised for decades. Camblin( 2003) described concerns about underserved students not attending college at the same rate as their White, middle-, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lack of opportunity for underserved students starting in middle school. </p> The " Creating a College Culture Project "( McClafferty, McDonough, &; Nunez, 2002) emerged from concerns about the declining number of college-bound students from a southern California cluster of 24 schools that were ethnically and racially diverse. McClafferty recommended that schools should create a " college culture " : a school culture that encourages all students to consider college by introducing information about higher education opportunities during early adolescence and in high school. This concept of creating a college culture among diverse adolescents, many who are considered " at-risk " of not graduating from high school, underlies our current project which uses mentoring as a key strategy to support at risk students during their middle school and high school years. </p> MENTORING DURING MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL Mentoring, the foundation for creating a college culture in our study, was initiated with a cohort of students in their sixth grade and has supported them from sixth through their current year, tenth grade. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Ference and Rhodes( 2002), describing a program very similar to our project, report that a mentoring program for at-risk middle school students at a professional development school site using preservice teachers enrolled in methods classes improved the grades of two-thirds of the young students and was a positive experience for the mentors. Herrera, Vang, and Gale( 2002) investigated three mentoring programs for middle school students and report associated improvements in students ' academic performance and attitudes. </p> After evaluating the impact of mentoring on middle and high school student achievement, attendance, and behavior, Illig( 1999) cautiously suggested that academic mentoring may provide some benefits for children and concludes that additional research is needed. In our study, the cohort of students was mentored by preservice teachers in a variety of educational activities that help create a college culture. Highlights from these mentoring activities include the mentor helping to guide college visits each year during the past five years. As the young students toured the campus the mentors explained how college ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential halls and dining halls, and student athletic facilities. During the first three visits the mentors guided the young students through a writing marathon process( Radcliffe &; Stephens, 2010) in which the students wrote reflections as they toured campus. Another writing activity guided by the mentors involved helping the students write digital stories about how to be successful in school and also about their future career plans. To help the young adolescents pass critical, state mandated tests in eighth grade the preservice teachers provided year-long tutoring in language arts and mathematics. Typically one mentor worked with two students throughout the semester, coaching them twice each week in half hour sessions. </p> As this cohort of students entered high school we shifted the mentoring focus to helping these students set goals and to sup porting their self-efficacy. Based on goal theory, mentoring should focus on the meaning students attach to achievement situations and the purpose to the actions taken( Ames, 1992 ; Barker, Dowson &; Mclnerney, 2002, Martin &; Dowson, 2009, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our study preservice teachers guided high school students in completing a goal orientation survey and discussing the meaning of goals. Within a college bound culture, reasons for engaging in a particular behavior or pursing a particular goal can become clearly defined( Dowson &; Mclnerney, 2001). Consistent with this the preservice teachers then assisted the high school students in setting short and long term goals that would support success in high school and a college-going future. </p> One of the main objectives in our study was to help the high school students develop high self efficacy. According to Bandura( 1986,1997), and Schunk and Miller( 2002), self-belief, motivation, and achievement develop when a caring, goal directed relationship emerges. The social relationship between our students and their preservice teachers became supportive and caring as they participated in weekly conversations, college information presentations, and college tours. The preservice teachers were committed to building a comfortable working relationship with their mentees, much in line with reports from Bandura( 1986,1997) and Schunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and achievement develop when a caring goal directed relationship emerges during mentoring. </p> RESEARCH PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of our seven-year research is to determine if creating a college-going culture through long-term mentoring of academically and economically at-risk students, starting in their sixth grade year and continuing through high school, has a positive impact on these students ' education. Our research question is, " Will a multi-faceted set of mentor-led strategies including college visits, goal setting, tutoring, career investigations, role model presentations, writing projects, and presentations about college preparation and life have a positive effect on students ' aspirations to attend college and their success gaining acceptance by a post-secondary institution? " These strategies support the over-arching design of this research study, illustrated in Table 1, Mentoring Goals and Strategies in Middle School by Grade Level( 6th-8th) to Support Building a College-Going Culture, which presents five mentoring goals. Plans for continuation of the strategies are included in Table 2, Mentoring Goals and Strategies in High School by Grade Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </p> This Year Five report describes research findings as well as factors and shifts occurring during the first five years of our seven year project that engages pre-service teachers in mentoring students, starting in students ' sixth grade year and continuing though high school, in order to create a college-going culture among the cohort of at-risk students. This report responds to several research questions about mentoring including( a) how have the students been supported by pre-service teachers through mentoring initiatives during grades 6-10 ;( b) how has this mentoring support changed over the five years ; and( c) what is the nature of the relationships between the men-tored students and their mentors? Two additional research questions focus on broader topics including ;( d) how have the students ' perceptions and aspirations about college changed during grades 6-10 ; and( e) how do the treatment group and control group students compare in perceptions and aspirations about college, drop-out rates after ninth grade, and scores on state-man dated assessments in a critical college preparation subject : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design involving randomly selected participants for the treatment and control groups, a series of data collection steps over the long term of the study, and data sources that include surveys, interviews, written reflective statements, student projects, and student enrollment and academic performance measures. </p> PARTICIPANTS The participants initially included 1 69 students who attended a rural school district located 10 miles outside of a major metropolitan area. Students in the treatment and control groups entered the study in Fall 2005, when they were in the sixth grade. The school district 's guidelines for academically and economically at-risk students, which include 13 statutory criteria such as low grades in two foundation subjects, were used to identify students for the study. With the assistance of school administrators, 100 students were randomly selected from the pool of about 120 at-risk students, 50 to serve in the treatment group and 50 to serve in a control group for our quasi-experimental research design. </p> During the first three years of the study, when the subjects were in grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject attrition resulting in a treatment group of 40 students and a control group of 40 students. A third student group, students( n = 35) who were on the school 's Fall 2006 honor roll( students who achieved all A and B grades), served as a second comparison group during the middle school grades. Another middle school comparison group, students who were neither at risk nor on the Fall 2006 honor roll, included 34 students who we have categorized as the routine group. During years four and five of the study, a number of the high school participants withdrew from the high school( and district) resulting in 33 treatment group students and 29 control group students at the end of the Fall 2009 semester. The composition of the participants in this study is 60% Hispanic, 30% Anglo, and 7% African-American. </p> The participants also include preservice teachers, typically college juniors and seniors, enrolled in two teacher preparation classes that are taught in a blended approach on the public school campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different group of about 25 to 30 preservice teachers meets twice a week from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the public school campus where the students under study are enrolled. Other participants include the school 's principal, academic dean, and the curriculum coordinator who are active planners and administrators in this project. </p> FIELD PROCEDURES This long term study is being conducted during the students ' normal school day and as part of the preservice teachers ' scheduled professional development courses that are hosted at the public school. Typically the student, or sometimes a pair of students, and a preservice teacher work together in a school classroom.The list and timetable for mentoring activities are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 which describe mentoring goals and strategies by grade levels( 6th-8th), and grade levels( 9th-12th) respectively. Parent permission signatures are collected for students ' participation in the project, and for each college visit. The school provides bus transportation for the students ' visit to the college which is conducted as an all-day field trip. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools including written self-surveys, structured written reflective reports, structured interviews, and digital stories prepared with Microsoft PowerPoint. School records were a source for students ' scores on the state mandated TAKS test( Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills), and allowed tracking students ' annual registration in the school district, an indicator of attendance and drop-out trends. </p> Each year we investigated students ' perceptions about college through written surveys that included 11 Likert-type questions such as " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is? " The surveys allowed us to compare treatment group students ' college perceptions as they progressed through several grades in the study, and also to compare the treatment group 's responses to the survey results of the control, routine, and honor roll groups. Data was collected directly from the treatment group students about their college perceptions through an on-line survey created in www.survey-monkey.com. The survey questions included " What is the most important thing to do now in order to attend college later? " </p> During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students created three digital stories, responding to three different prompts including " Describe an interest or positive experience at school ", " What career or job do you want during your twenties? ", and " What must students do to be successful in middle school? " The content of the stories provided insight into students ' career goals and perceptions of how to get there. </p> The treatment group students were interviewed by the preservice teachers to investigate their experiences with their college campus tour. An example question is " What is one thing you remember about your visit? " We also collected the preservice teachers ' written reflections about the tours. At the end of the second year of the study we used an unstructured interview approach with the principal to explore her perceptions of the need for the study, the impacts of the research project components, and the benefits for her students. </p> During the treatment groups ' eighth grade year, when the mentoring support focused on tutoring the students in preparation for the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a critical college preparation content area : math. In response to the high school principal 's suggestion, support for the students shifted in their ninth grade year to individual mentoring, focused on defining short and long term goals. Data about the students ' goal orientation was collected from the cohort of students using the Manual for the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales( Midgley, et a I., 2000) to formulate our questions. </p> DATA ANALYSIS The hand written and online surveys included Likert-like questions, each with five response options. As an example, the question " How difficult do you think getting accepted into college is? " included five response options ranging from " not so difficult " to " too difficult for me ". Responses were analyzed using SPSS( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) statistical test software to determine mean scores and to analyze variation among groups. Higher mean scores were interpreted to suggest higher aspirations or more positive perceptions regarding college-going issues. For the state TAKS assessment, group mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in the treatment group and the control group. Chart 1, Students ' Math Scores by Year, graphs the groups ' scores. </p> The responses to questions on structured written surveys and interviews were reviewed by the authors who looked for repetition of terms or statements. For example, a tally of responses to the question " How did the visit to the university impact the students ' perceptions about attending a university? " netted eight responses that included " excited ", five responses stating " enjoyed it ", four responses indicating " interested ", two responses of " overwhelmed ", and so on. The authors reported their consensus on the collective meaning of such data. For example, in the above case the authors concluded that students had positive perceptions. </p> FINDINGS Our findings are organized by the following five research questions. How have the students been mentored, and how did this support our project goals? </p> The timetable and types of mentoring support are outlined in Table 1, Mentoring Goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Support Building a College-Going Culture, and in Table 2 which describes subsequent support in high school. In summary the mentors hosted the students on college tours each Spring during which the students attended college classes and presentations about college admission and financial aid procedures. A significant mentoring effort during the tours was the preservice teachers ' initiative in guiding the students to reflect on their experiences of college through a writing marathon approach. The students ' responses on follow-up surveys, which indicated that they gained positive perceptions of college, support our project goals numbered one through three( Table I). </p> During their eighth grade year, the students ' mentors tutored them in preparation for the state mandated TAKS test. Based on the mentor 's content strength in language arts or mathematics, the mentors individually tutored students who were weak in either language arts or mathematics. This significant mentoring initiative may have contributed to all of the students passing their TAKS tests, which also supports our project goal number four( Table I). </p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the students set short and long term goals that support success in high school and a college-going future. Once every other week for at least thirty minutes, the mentors met with their student(s) to discuss the students ' goals and progress. The principal stated that this mentoring initiative was very important to insuring that the students stayed in school. Noteworthy, fewer of the mentored students withdrew from school as compared to the control group students. This outcome is critical to supporting all of our project goals. </p> How HAS THIS MENTORING SUPPORT CHANGED OVER THE FIVE YEARS? The nature of the college visits has changed in three ways. With each annual visit we reduced the structure for the visit in terms of a defined, detailed plan of specific places to visit and a timetable for each visit stop. Related to this we gave more power to the young students to select where they wanted to tour and how long they wanted to spend at each tour stop. Finally, we increased the tour 's emphasis on presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nature of residential life. </p> The type of support for the young students shifted during their sixth through tenth grade years as the students matured and their school setting changed. Mentoring during their sixth and seventh grade years addressed helping them explore future career interests, recognize the importance of education to their future, and discover the nature of college. Mentor support during the students ' eighth grade was shifted at the request of the middle school principal who asked that the mentors tutor the students in mathematics and language arts to help them pass the state mandated eighth grade TAKS test. </p> The mentoring support shifted again in ninth grade at the suggestion of the high school principal who requested that the mentors help support the ninth grade students ' adjustment to the rigors of high school life. Specifically the support focused on one-on-one mentoring that in ninth grade addressed helping the students find a niche in high school, and then expanded during ninth and tenth grade into setting short and long term goals that support success in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presentations about college shifted after the students entered high school. During their middle school years college information had been presented only once a year, when the young students were on a college campus tour. Starting in ninth grade we hosted several college presentations each year at the high school. For example, during one semester preservice teachers presented on the topic of ' college student athletes '. </p> The schedules for meetings between the students and their mentors became more flexible after the students entered high school. During their middle school years the young students met twice a week with their mentor during their first period at school. In high school the students and mentors met during several lunch meetings each semester. In addition, the students were able to meet with their mentor in one of the student 's daily classes where the mentor was scheduled to fulfill preservice teacher assignments. </p> The final shift in mentoring involved a gradual reduction in our role as researchers to structure the mentoring role. The mentoring role during middle school was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The preservice teachers ' professor closely guided their mentoring efforts, and required a product such as the young students ' digital stories. This locus of control shifted in high school to a more flexible and individualized mentoring approach where during lunch and/or in a morning class the high school student and mentor met to identify goals and discuss how to achieve them. </p> WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MENTORED STUDENTS AND THEIR MENTORS? </p> During the students ' sixth through eighth grade years, the mentors followed a teaching role. They helped their young charges learn how to write a digital story, how to engage in a writing marathon, and how to complete language arts or mathematics homework assignments. The relationships between mentors and the middle school students were typically trusting, respectful, and individualized. The students often showed pride in working with a mentor ; sometimes the middle school students would point out to their peers : " there 's my mentor. " </p> Positive relationships continued in high school where the ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college student, their mentor. Students were accustomed to seeing mentors in their school and were comfortable talking to them. Mentors were amazed at how open and accepting their mentees appeared. Students shared their interests, accomplishments in sports, their success or lack of success in classes, and how they saw themselves in the future. The mentor-mentee relationship became causal and supportive where mentors showed interests in how the student was adjusting to high school, whether they had found supportive friends, and if they were involved in athletics or belonged to a club. </p> HOW HAVE THE STUDENTS ' COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS CHANGED DURING GRADES 7-10? </p> The impact of the project on the treatment group students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th grade about college perceptions, revealed that these students initially had positive perceptions, and that these perceptions became more positive. The difference, using paired samples, between the mean scores of the 31 students who took the survey during 7th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p =.02, with the 8th grade scores( M = 43) exceeding the 7th grade scores( M = 41). The difference between the mean scores of the 24 students who took the same survey during the 8th and 9th grades was also statistically significant,( 23) = -2.07, p =.050, with the 9th grade scores( M = 44) exceeding the 8th grade scores( M = 42). The mean scores of the 19 students who took the survey during the 9th and 10th grades was not statistically significant, t(18) =.09, p =.93, with the 10th grade scores( M = 45) equivalent to the 9th grade scores( M = 45). </p> The four-point gain in scores( 10%) over the span of four surveys has some practical significance. A mean score above 33 is interpreted as suggesting a positive perception about college. Supporting this, the preservice teachers who mentored the students consistently reported that the students were positive about the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN THEIR COLLEGE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS, THEIR MATH SCORES ON STATE-MANDATED ASSESSMENTS, AND THEIR DROP-OUT RATES AFTER 9TH GRADE? </p> Surveys administered at the end of eighth grade revealed that the treatment group students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the perceptions of students in the control, routine, and honor roll groups. The treatment group had the highest mean score on the survey( M = 44), followed by the honor roll group( M = 42), the routine group( M = 40), and the control group( M = 39). A NOVA test results for differences in perceptions of treatment, control, routine, and honor roll groups revealed a statistically significant difference, F( 3,133) = 4.1 73, p =.007, in mean scores for the groups. Tukey HSD post-hoc tests suggested that treatment students ' perceptions about college were more positive than the control group 's. </p> During the first two years of high school a number of students stopped attending high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher attrition than the treatment group. School and district enrollment records revealed that seven of the forty treatment group students, representing 17594 of their group withdrew from the school. They are not attending school elsewhere in the district. Eleven of the forty control group student, representing 28.5% of their group, withdrew and are not attending school in the district </p> Tracking of students math scores on the state mandated TAKS assessment at the end of 7th, 8th and 9th grade? revealed rising scores for the treatment group and declining scores for the control group as illustrated in Chart 1, Students ' Math Scores by Year </p> DISCUSSON OF FINDINGS RELATED TO SHIFTS IN MENTORING AND OUTCOME PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS HAVE PERFORMED A VARIETY OF MENTORINO ROLES. </p> The pre-service teachers performed five different roles, charging their roles in response to the students needs and level of maturity. Initially they as sumed the role of a teacher, helping the student in sixth and seventh grades learn how to write a digital story and how to engage in a writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide, declined in the level of authority as the students matured. Mentors fed the college tours when the student were in the sixth and seventh grades, they fecilitated the tours when the students became eighth graders, and finally they served as tour chaperones after the students entered high school. During the students ' eighth grade the pre-service teachers ' key role was to tutor the students in preparation for their state-mandated math and language arts assessments. When the students entered high school the pre-service teachers assumed a distinctly different role, to help the students set short and long term goals, and to coach them on how to find a niche in high school. Throughout the mentoring of students during their sixth-tenth grade years, the pre-service teachers regularly acted as a role model in both formal approaches, such as giving a presentation about being a college athlete, and in less formal approaches including daily discussions about how to be successful in school and the importance of college. </p> MANY FACTORS HAVE INFLUENCED THE NEED TO CHANGE MENTORING ROLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college tours changed due to three factors. As the young students matured and became more familiar with the nature of a college campus they needed less structure to guide their visit. After several tours, students gained specific interests in the college campus which led them to choose their visit stops. Finally, as the young students became more familiar with the nature of college life, they developed interests and concerns in some of the challenging aspects such as admission procedures, financial aid needs, and residential hall life-styles. In response to this, we added presentations about these topics to the college tour agenda. </p> The support for the young students shifted to tutoring during their eighth grade year because of a critical factor. These young students had to pass the state-man dated TAKS assessment modules in order to be accepted into high school. Mentoring support changed again as the students entered ninth grade because of another critical factor. These students needed support to help insure that they stayed in high school rather than dropping out. Their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals that would sustain them in high school and that they might not find a high school niche that would help them develop a sense of belongingness and identity. In response the pre-service teachers focused their mentoring support on goal-setting with the ninth graders. </p> Starting in high school, mentoring opportunities to learn about college were expanded from the pre-service teachers leading an annual college tour to giving presentations at the high school about college life. The factor causing this change is that when students progress to high school their need to know about college admissions and financial aid becomes more acute and relevant to setting academic goals, student activity goals, and after-school employment goals. </p> In high school, the meetings between ninth graders and preservice teachers became less compulsory because unlike the middle school 's schedule which included a daily advisory period, there was no slot in the high school schedule other than a lunch period during which all ninth graders and all preservice teachers could meet. Also, unlike the middle school where attendance in the daily advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with a preservice teacher during lunch was a voluntary decision by the ninth grader. Because meetings were not compulsory in ninth grade it became important to motivate the ninth graders to meet by offering a series of pizza lunch meetings during which the students and their mentors met. In the tenth grade we were able to improve on structuring meetings by assigning the student 's mentor to a classroom that the student attended daily. </p> The mentoring role shifted from being highly structured in terms of tasks and schedules which were designed by the pre-service teachers ' professors and were product oriented, to a more individualized mentoring approach because the needs of the students were changing. In middle school, young students need an organized introduction to college because they are very uninformed about college. Our structured, guided, and product oriented approach helped introduce the middle school students to the nature of college. However, as the students gained knowledge about college and also entered high school where they began to be confronted with their individual future after graduation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Beginning in high school the preservice teachers met individually with their ninth graders to discuss individual goals and how to achieve them. </p> RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MENTORS AND MENTEES CHANGED FOR SEVERAL REASONS </p> The relationship between mentors and mentees shifted over five years as the young adolescents matriculated from sixth graders to tenth graders. As twelve-year-old youngsters the mentees ' relationship with their mentors was a student to teacher relationship in which the preservice teacher presented instruction and led college campus tours. Over the course of five years this evolved to a more casual adolescent to adult-model relationship in which the preservice teacher helped their mentee set goals, shared college experiences, and chaperoned college campus tours. Of the five factors that caused this shift the most significant was the growing maturity of the mentees in terms of social, emotional, physical, and intellectual characteristics. A related factor was the closing of the age gap between mentees and mentors. The age of the mentors remained constant since each semester new mentors, typically 21- or 22-year-old preservice teachers, rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program at age 12 were 16 years old at the end of the fifth year of the study. Both factors, the mentees ' growing maturity and the closing of this age gap, led to less formality and authority in the mentoring relationship. Contributing to this relaxation in the relationship was the third factor, the intentional shift in the program from emphasizing instruction and tutoring by the mentors to concentrating on individualized goal-setting support from the mentors. Another factor, the shift in climate from a middle school to a high school setting, created a more grown-up setting that encouraged adult-like behavior in the mentees. Finally, after four years of experience in the building a college-going culture program, the mentees gained comfort and understanding in how to relate to their mentoring preservice teachers. </p> The findings of our research suggest that there may be positive relationships between participation in the multiple facets of our building a college-culture program and student outcomes including growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college, perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors may also influence students ' college perceptions, high school perseverance, and academic scores. For example, students ' perceptions about high school and college may be impacted by discussions with peers and family members, the influence of role models through popular media, college marketing as appearing on the internet, and high school guidance office communications. In addition students ' academic scores on state mandated tests may be impacted by the variety of instruction efforts at school including individualized instruction, summer classes, and tutoring. </p> DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS IN RESPONSE TO FIVE MENTORING GOALS GOAL #7 : STUDENTS WILL UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF COLLEGE </p> Our key strategy for helping students understand the nature of college was escorting them on a day-long campus visit each Spring which involved them in writing about their visit through a writing marathon, allowed them to help plan their visit stops, and engaged them in college information presentations. After participating in several visits it became clear that the students were learning about college based on a review of their writing marathon responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and was so amazed. I 've never seen a stage like it. It was so much better than the one we have at our school. " In addition they were taking charge of planning the itinerary for their campus walk, asking informed questions during presentations, and demonstrating more insight about college as evident in their post-tour survey responses such as " The classes are huge which is good because there is bound to be one person that can help you. " </p> GOAL #2 : STUDENTS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS </p> Two key strategies for helping students recognize that a college education may be important to their future success included the digital story assignments and the motivational presentations about college, typically presented by currently enrolled college students. Reviews of the students ' digital stories about their future careers revealed that they often described plans for attending college as they shared their vision of developing a career. For example a student explained " want to attend college so I can go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question with a statement indicating commitment to college such as " When I am a college freshman " Finally, students ' aspirations toward college were very evident in their written survey responses such as " want to go here when I am older. I want to be a business owner of a major corporation. " </p> GOAL #3 : STUDENTS WILL GAIN POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS AND ASPIRATIONS ABOUT COLLEGE </p> In written reflections about the marathons the preservice teachers consistently reported that the students were excited and positive about their visit and about the prospect of college. As previously reported in this report, students ' perceptions about college based on a survey administered in 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th grades about college perceptions revealed that their perceptions became more positive over several years. </p> GOAL #4 : STUDENTS WILL PREPARE ACADEMICALLY FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION </p> A key strategy for helping students prepare academically for college admissions was tutoring them twice per week in mathematics and/or language arts during their eighth grade year. Tutoring during this year was critical to the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessments in order to enter high school and because some high school level college-track type courses are dependent on success in middle school courses, particularly in pre-algebra. Students ' math scores increased as previously illustrated in this report and all students passed the state-mandated tests including math. </p> GOAL #5 : STUDENTS WILL SET SHORT AND LONG TERM GOALS CONSISTENT WITH A COLLEGE-GOING FUTURE. </p> A review of students ' written goals reveals that many of their goals are consistent with a college-going culture. For example one student wrote, " My chosen plan is to go to college, get a bachelors degree in political science, then go to a Texas law school in Houston to be a lawyer. " Another student wrote, " My chosen plan is to graduate high school and maybe take two years of community college and after that decide if I want to take two more at another college or try to a good job. " The mentors also reported that their students were setting goals consistent with going to college. A mentor explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goals included : " high SAT/ACT scores, and acceptance into college. " Another mentor reported that her student 's goals were to improve her GPA and maintain good status at school so that she can apply for college. </p> CONCLUSION The U.S. Department of Labor( 2005) forecasts 13% growth in the national workforce between 2004 and 2014. Many of the projected jobs will require an associate or four-year college degree. Projections of the attainment of college certificates and degrees among future workers fall short of predicted workforce needs( National Association of Manufacturers, 2007). The current study is significant because the findings from this study at year five of the seven year term suggest that the project 's many strategies to build a college-going culture through mentoring may be associated with students ' growth in positive perceptions and aspirations about college, perseverance in school as opposed to withdrawing, and improvement in state-mandated assessment scores. These factors may contribute to improving these students ' likelihood of attending college. </p> As this project continues, we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and we will continue to adjust the mentoring approaches as appropriate to meet the project 's five mentoring goals and to build a college-going culture. </p> Table 1.
