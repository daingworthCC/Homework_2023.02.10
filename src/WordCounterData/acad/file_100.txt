4014741 Section : Features Scientists hope new methods of biocontrol can stop the advance of this imported pest <p> For more than 50 years, this foreign invader has preyed on anyone or anything that dares to get in its way. It looks like a native, making it difficult to recognize. But its painful sting makes it hard to forget. The Brazilian red fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is out of control in the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico, state and federal sources say. It is threatening to other insects, wildlife, and people, because it arrived without the natural enemies that usually keep its populations under control. <p> Without successful control, the fire ant, which requires only a warm climate and moderate rainfall to flourish, could eventually cover one-quarter of the United States, according to a 1986 study by the Texas Department of Agriculture. It has already spread across 250 million acres from Georgia to Texas. Attempts to halt its spread with pesticides, which have been largely unsuccessful because control has been only temporary, have cost $200 million. Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ant has killed off as much as 40% of all native insect species in some areas. <p> Scientists, however, are finding ways to fight back. For example, they hope to release tiny flies of the family Phoridae, which control fire ant populations in Brazil. Researchers at the University of Texas have just brought the flies into the United States for further field study, after having received permission from the US Department of Agriculture( USDA). They plan to gather enough data on the flies ' parasitic specificity to obtain permission for its general release within the next year or two. <p> There are several native species of fire ants in the United States, including Solenopsis xyloni and Solenopsis geminata, and two imported species, S. invicta( red) and Solenopsis richteri( black). The S. geminata and red imported fire ants look so similar that it can be difficult for even an entomologist to tell them apart, says Larry Gilbert, a professor of zoology and the director of the Brackenridge Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensity for colony growth <p> Unusual behavioral traits allow the fire ant to form large colonies and to dominate the territories it invades. The fire ant sometimes forms multiple-queen colonies, which are larger than single-queen colonies. No one knows why the fire ant developed this multiple-queen form, which occurs in both the United States and Brazil, but its cause could be genetic, developmental, or a combination of the two, says Sanford Porter, a USDA researcher in Gainesville, Florida. <p> Ants from these polygyne colonies appear less territorial than ants from colonies with a single queen. Because they can better tolerate ants of their species from other colonies, the imported fire ant 's territories overlap and are two to three times more densely populated. The greater density helps the fire ant to more effectively fight off other ant species competing for food. <p> Last year, Porter published a study in the Journal of Economic Entomology 86 : 1344 in which he examined whether multiple-queen colonies of S. invicta were spreading faster than single-queen colonies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate of less than 4%. He learned that the ratio of single- to multiple-queen colonies depends on geography. In Texas, 50% of colonies have multiple queens, in Florida, 15-20% have them, and in Georgia, there are almost exclusively single-queen colonies. <p> Another contributor to the explosion of imported fire-ant growth was mass pesticide sprayings in the 1950s and 1960s, says Stan Temple, a wildlife ecologist from the University of Wisconsin in Madison. " Chemical warfare hastened the advance of the fire ant, " he says. Although imported fire ants were temporarily affected by the treatments, the pesticides more effectively weakened many native ant species in the area, which allowed the multiple-queen colonies of the imported fire ant to revive and flourish. The threat to wildlife and livestock <p> The red imported ant has ten times more colonies per area than any native ant species, and each colony contains more individual ants than do native ant colonies. In addition to the reduction of native S. geminata colonies, the black imported fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of S. invicta. It was originally a pest itself, when it was introduced to the United States from Brazil in the 1920s, but now occupies only a small area in northeastern Mississippi and northwestern Alabama. <p> Other ant species have suffered as well. In fact, up to 90% of total native ant populations, and 70% of all native species of ant have been wiped out in some areas, according to Gilbert. He says that seed-harvesting ants have completely disappeared in many areas of Texas. Other groups of arthropods that have lost habitat to the fire ant include ladybugs and many species of spiders, ticks, and cockroaches. <p> In addition to greatly reducing populations of arthropods, the fire ant has harmed other groups of animals. Although there has been anecdotal evidence about fire ant damage to vertebrate populations for years, only now are scientists beginning to do formal studies. A group of graduate students at Texas A &M; University in College Station, led by wildlife biologist Bill Grant, has studied how fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, whose small size, only 10-12 grams, makes them vulnerable to the ants. The researchers have found that the presence of the ants changes the mice 's foraging behavior and their use of habitats. The mice spend less time eating, and they keep their distance from areas where the ant is present, to avoid its painful sting. <p> Craig Allen and colleagues of Texas Tech University in Lubbock found that survival of the white-tailed deer fawn was twice as high in areas that were treated to temporarily remove the ant compared to areas inhabited by the ant. The fire ant attacks the fawn by stinging it repeatedly around its ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The deer can be blinded or killed by toxins in the ant 's sting. <p> Temple 's group has linked the spread of fire ant colonies to the decline in population of the loggerhead shrike, a grassland bird that is endangered in nine states. The shrike breeds in the Midwest, spends its summers there, then migrates south in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.7% a year. This decline is faster than that of any other bird in the Midwest, Temple says. <p> Ecologists were long puzzled by the bird 's decline because the shrikes had a good breeding habitat and a high reproductive success rate. When Temple and his colleagues began banding the birds, they discovered that the shrike 's winter survival rates were lower than expected. The scientists looked at changes in the shrike 's winter habitat and found that, in addition to changes in land use, the shrike 's decline in particular counties directly correlated with an increase in fire ants in the same areas. Further investigation revealed that the shrike and fire ant are direct competitors for food sources. Both feed on invertebrates, reptiles, and small mammals. Temple says the fire ant creates a sterile habitat for the wintering shrike ; the migrating shrike settles into this habitat without enough food to support it through the winter. The wildlife biology group at Texas Tech also found loggerhead shrike populations significantly lower in imported fire ant territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-round have not had the same problems as those that migrate because they select habitats without ants and hold their territories against migrators. The migrating shrike is thus forced to take the leftovers. Evidence suggests that, like the shrike, other migrating grassland birds, including the meadowlark, bluebird, and grassland sparrow, are declining in numbers because of the fire ant, says Temple. <p> Ellen Petersen, a graduate student at Texas A &M,; found that other birds native to fire ant regions are also affected. Bobwhite quail chicks spend less time eating when fire ants are present, because they are trying to avoid being stung. The subsequent reduction in body weight can leave the young quail more vulnerable to predators. Other studies have reported reductions in bird populations due to fire ant predation of eggs that are just beginning to hatch. <p> The imported fire ant also poses a threat to livestock and pets. A February 1994 survey of Texas veterinarians reported money spent on treating fire ant injuries to animals was $750,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said fire ants were a serious threat to animal health, causing blindness, skin infections around sting areas, and sometimes death, especially to newborn or sick animals. <p> For people allergic to its sting, the fire ant can cause anaphylactic shock, or even death. When the fire ant stings, it grabs onto its prey with its mouth and attacks its victims with a stinger on its abdomen. Often, one fire ant stings several times, and the venom it injects causes painful pustules to form, which can leave permanent scars. Fire ants have been known to cause auto accidents, gathering under a car 's floor mats, and attacking the driver in traffic. They can invade homes, chew through electrical wiring, and destroy gardens. Their presence has been known to cause people to move out of their homes. Revenge of the phorid flies <p> Researchers at the University of Texas, along with colleagues Porter, Don Feener of the University of Utah, and Brazilian coworkers, hope that biocontrol methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are studying several of the 14 different phorid fly species of the genus Pseudacteon, which specialize in parasitism to S. invicta and related species in Brazil. They hope to determine which species will best control the imported fire ant and which will best thrive in US climate conditions. <p> There are native species of Pseudacteon that attack native fire ants in the southern United States, but they do not attack or control the Brazilian ant. Feener suspects that trail pheromones left by the native ants when they venture from their nest allow the native flies to locate them. The imported ant does not leave pheromones the native flies can recognize, so they do not enter the ant 's foraging areas. <p> " Imported fire ants arrived without a cadre of control agents, " says Gilbert. " Introducing the flies will help make the ants a regular member of the community. " In Brazil, when the fly is around, the fire ant runs for cover and acts less aggressively towards other ant species, giving them a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North America, the imported phorid fly species are not expected to eradicate imported fire ant populations, rather they are expected to reduce the pest ant 's ability to compete. <p> The fire ant has good reason to avoid the phorid. Phorid flies lay their eggs on or into the ant 's thorax or head, depending on the species. After the eggs hatch, the larvae feast on the ant 's head tissue. When they have eaten enough, the ant 's head falls off and " the rest of the body just stands there quivering, " says Porter. The fly then pupates in the ant 's head capsule, which is lying in the bottom of the nest among the other ants. <p> Feener says there is no danger that releasing the imported phorid fly will cause problems for native ant species. He has studied interactions of phorid flies and fire ants, and he says the native and imported species groups evolved geographically separated from each other. <p> Gilbert has considered using the phorid fly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 landmark report in Science( 214 : 815), which demonstrated the impact of phorid flies on ants. During recent trips to Brazil, studies by Gilbert, University of Texas colleague Matt Orr, and Brazilian scientists Woody Benson and Sergio Seike convinced Gilbert that this plan will work. In Brazil, Pseudacteon flies have a dramatic impact in specifically preventing fire ants from foraging for food, Gilbert says. <p> If the Brazilian Pseudacteon prove to be as host specific as indicated by all the observations in the field and laboratory thus far, Gilbert and his colleagues say they advocate experimental releases into isolated US S. invicta populations. The fly would be released on the edge of the imported ant 's range in Texas to evaluate the effectiveness of phorids in shifting populations back towards native ants. <p> Frank Howarth, an entomologist at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu and an outspoken opponent of biocontrol, says he is skeptical that the behavior of the phorid fly is well enough known to ensure that native ants will not be harmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there needs to be more thorough reviews of prerelease data and better postrelease monitoring than there have been in the past. If the imported phorid fly does switch over to native species of Solenopsis, the natives could be much more vulnerable to harm than is the imported fire ant because they have not evolved defenses against the flies, he says. <p> Gilbert agrees with Howarth about the need for care, but he points out that the Pseudacteon specific to the native fire ants have not shifted in 50 years of exposure. He says recent unpublished evidence shows that Pseudacteon have an " antibody-like specificity " to their host ant species. <p> Other researchers also have their doubts about the effectiveness of the phorid flies. Jerry Stimac, a researcher at the University of Florida, says he has little hope the flies will control imported fire ant populations. To get on top of the problem, he says, you have to get down into the nest. Because 50% of fire ants never leave the nest, the fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert counters that phorid flies affect the ants indirectly. He says the idea of changing community dynamics as a means of biocontrol has not been fully explored. Other strategies for control <p> Those scientists working on the phorid fly project agree that releasing the fly will not completely eliminate the need for other control methods. Ed Vargo, an entomologist at the University of Texas Brackenridge Field Laboratory, is looking at new ways to wipe out Brazilian fire ant populations by treating the ant with its own pheromones instead of pesticides. Pheromones control how the queens reproduce ; they also control whether workers accept their queens. He hopes to identify these active chemicals and create a treatment that would cause the queens to halt egg production or induce worker ants to kill their queens. <p> Stimac is studying another type of biocontrol for the ant, a fungus called Beauveria bassiana. It is pathogenic to all ant species. He hopes to find a way to distribute the fungus in a bait around fire-ant nests so that it is preferentially foraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nests where it can kill the entire population. Howarth argues that the Beauveria could cause even more harm than the phorid fly, because certain strains have been known to attack not only ants, but termites, frogs, and fish. <p> However much effort it will take to develop acceptable methods of control, the need is critical. Gilbert says that in addition to the many problems the fire ant causes for people and livestock, the growing threat to biodiversity is another crucial reason to control the ant. He points out that in central Texas, 20 years ago, you could go out, lift up a rock, and see scorpions, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes. " Now all you see are ants, " he says, " fire ants.
