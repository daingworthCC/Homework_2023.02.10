4080241 Gender-based violence( GBV) affects women across race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, religion, sexual orientation, and geographic boundaries. No segments of society are immune from the vestiges of this problem. Yet GBV has been particularly harmful within communities of African ancestry African American communities suffer with greater lethality and more severe injuries than other racial and ethnic groups as a result of GBV. Despite this, there are limited culturally based services available to assist this population. The black experience-based social work( BEBSW) perspective, developed by Elmer and Joanne Martin, offers a framework that can be applied with black communities to address GBV. The central themes of BEBSW, which are separation and loss, are applied to considering strategies to address GBV within the African American community. KEY WORDS : African Americans ; black social work ; cultural competence ; domestic violence ; gender-based violence Gender-based violence( GBV) is defined as " physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). GBV includes childhood sexual abuse, " prenatal sex selection in favor of boys, female infanticide, dowry deaths, honour killings, female genital mutilation, trafficking and forced prostitution, forced early marriage, sexual assault and intimate partner violence "( Renzetti, 2005, p. 1009). Although GBV is a critical problem within communities of color, limited culturally competent interventions are available to address this issue. The black experience-based social work( BEBSW) perspective, as discussed by Martin and Martin( 1995), offers a culturally based framework that can be applied within black communities. The central themes of BEBSW are separation and loss and are explained by using the three concepts : moaning, mourning, and morning. The purpose of this article is to explore how BEBSW can be applied to finding solutions for GBV among African American women. SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Although this article discusses GBV solutions for African American women, it is important to contextualize the problem of GBV. It is estimated that one out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsberg, 2006 ; Stevens, 2001). In a World Health Organization study on women 's health and domestic violence within 10 countries, physical violence, sexual violence, or both existed among 15 percent to 71 percent of the women( Garcia-Moreno, Jasen, Ellsberg, Helse, &; Watts, 2005). In another multicountry study on domestic violence, between 21 percent and 58 percent of the women surveyed experienced physical and sexual violence in their lifetime, and between 17 percent and 48 percent of these women experienced the same type of violence at the hands of an intimate partner( Kishor &; Kiersten, 2004). Intimate partner violence( IPV) is the most common of these types of violence. In a review of 70 population-based studies, the rate of IPV among women was between 10 percent and 60 percent( Ellsberg, 2006). In country after country, the statistics are staggering : Nearly 50 percent of women in Bangladesh have experienced IPV from a male partner ; 80 percent of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 83 seconds, a woman is raped in South Africa, with only 20 percent of these women reporting the case to police annually( Family Violence Prevention Fund, 2007 ; Pan American Health Organization, 2005). The United States is not exempt from these forms of violence. More than 30 percent of U.S. women have reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend each year( Commonwealth Fund, 1999), with estimates as high as 5 million U.S. women experiencing domestic violence each year( National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2003). African American women have been particularly vulnerable to more lethal forms of violence and greater severity of violence than other groups of women( Bent-Goodley, 2001 ; T. West, 1999). Women of color face increased barriers to treatment and are less likely to obtain services that are culturally responsive and, hence, more targeted at the social and cultural contexts in which they live( Bent-Goodley, 2005b ; Sokoloff &; Pratt, 2005). African American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the home and become incarcerated under mandatory arrest laws compared with women from other ethnic groups( Bent-Goodley, 2005b). African American women are more likely to be resistant to receiving services for fear of being treated poorly or misunderstood by the practitioner( Bent-Goodley, 2004 ; T. West, 1999). They have also experienced discriminatory treatment ; for example, African American women have been turned away from services, arrested, and prosecuted because of negative stereotypes( Bent-Goodley, 2005b ; T. West, 1999). Increasingly, GBV has been acknowledged as a serious reproductive, sexual, psychosocial, and public health issue for women. Women who have experienced GBV have been more likely to experience poorer health, chronic pain, memory loss, spontaneous and induced abortion, and greater abuse during pregnancy( Campbell, 2002 ; Women 's International Network News, 2003). The connection between GBV and HIV has also received increasing attention as the rates of HIV are soaring in communities of African ancestry around the world( Bent-Goodley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate condom usage, can interfere with her ability to obtain needed medical or drug treatment, and can place her at risk of violence if it is determined that she has HIV/AIDS( Decker, Silverman &; Raj, 2005 ; Garcia-Moreno &; Watts, 2000 ; Go et al., 2003 ; Maman, Campbell, Sweat, &; Gielen, 2000). Having a history of forced sex places women and girls at an even greater risk of contracting HIV/ AIDS( Andersson et al., 2004 ; Dunkle et al., 2004 ; Fullilove et al., 1993 ; Wyatt et al., 2002). Finding solutions to this problem must include a culturally based approach. Cultural Responses to GBV Because GBV touches the lives of people from such diverse cultures, it requires a culturally based approach. The different social and cultural contexts are critical to developing responses that are effective and make sense to the particular population( Duffy, 2005 ; Jones et al., 2001). Women of color have acknowledged the importance of looking not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also at how they intersect to make women even more vulnerable to violence and other forms of oppression( Bent-Goodley, 2005b ; Guedes, Bott, &; Cuca, 2002 ; Sokoloff &; Pratt, 2005 ; van der Hoogte &; Kingma, 2004). As such, stereotypes of women of color, lack of trust of outsiders and public officials, and fear of reporting due to the potential for discriminatory treatment and further violence are all reasons that women of color have given for why services should be culturally grounded and based on the recommendations of women in the community. Interventions should be holistic and should not just focus on the individual ; they should include an emphasis on the pervasive social ills, formidable health challenges, social and economic inequities, community perceptions, and social hierarchies that perpetuate these issues. Those in the international community, particularly women of color, have already begun the process of developing initiatives targeting GBV( Guedes, 2004 ; Melendez, Hoffman, Exner, Leu, &; Ehrhardt, 2003 ; O'Hara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2001). However, similar initiatives within the United States have been limited. This article offers one conceptualization of how to use a culturally based approach to address domestic violence in the African American community. BLACK EXPERIENCE-BASED SOCIAL WORK( BEBSW) There are strengths among African Americans that can be used to respond to domestic violence. The BEBSW approach builds on these strengths( Bent-Goodley, 2005a ; Carlton-LaNey, 2001 ; Graham, 2000 ; Harvey, 2001 ; Martin &; Martin, 2002 ; Myers, 1988 ; Schiele, 2000). BEBSW stands out as one way of addressing this complex issue through a culturally based approach. Using this approach does not dishonor the great variation and diversity of historical and contemporary experiences within the African American community, but, instead, builds on the notion of connectedness that still exists within this rich culture. BEBSW " drawls from a social work emphasis on black experiences, black values, black perspectives, and black methods of problem solving "( Martin &; Martin, 1995, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Africa, slavery, and rural life after emancipation... had their own ways of identifying problems and their own tools of intervention "( p. 12). African Americans have developed effective mechanisms to address social and community problems. BEBSW allows providers to build on that tradition. Martin and Martin( 1995) argued that at the heart of many social problems in the black community is the struggle to deal with being separated from and losing family and friends. As a result, the three major concepts of BEBSW are moaning, mourning, and morning : " a linear progression from suffering( moaning) to collective healing and support( mourning) and finally toward an ideal state of health, happiness, and transformation( morning) "( pp. 15-16). Each concept is centered on the problem of separation and loss and the associated historical and contemporary trauma. Concept One : Moaning Moaning " refers to black pain, suffering and grief. Through moanin ', or crying or shouting out, black people sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its reality "( Martin &; Martin, 1995, p. 15). Social workers are encouraged to focus on the problem of separation and loss and its associated trauma during this point of engagement in the helping relationship. Assessment is a part of this phase, as the social worker is required to assess the presenting issues and determine the nature of the problem. Essential to this concept is understanding that the survival of black people has largely rested on the ability to mask the problem. Building from historical and contemporary examples, Martin and Martin( 1995) suggested that three major challenges to problem definition and assessment are( 1) being able to see beyond the mask,( 2) developing a trusting helping relationship, and( 3) continuing use of inadequate assessment tools that do not consider cultural influences and strengths that can aid in the assessment process. In application, Martin and Martin( 1995) emphasized the importance of using different assessment tools to ascertain what has happened and what is happening and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for diverse tools of assessment that not only identify what is happening now, but also assess cultural history and how it applies to the current dilemma. The assessment process should not be limited to the individual and the present situation, but should also include an examination of the larger collective and historical context that could ' shape the individual 's experiences, circumstances, interpretations, and perceptions of the situation( Carlton-LaNey, 2001 ; Franklin, 2000 ; Hill, 1999). Using a BEBSW approach to assess GBV, its presence and severity, one must consider the nature of the helping relationship and how GBV is identified. A practitioner must work to develop trust with a woman before expecting the woman to divulge personal information that may, in her mind, have implications for herself, her family, and her community( Bent-Goodley, 2005a ; Boyd-Franklin, 2006). It is also critical to recognize that, as part of surviving the situation, past experiences, and the contemporary reality of her situation, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin &; Martin, 1995). Without understanding the need to use the mask, the practitioner could incorrectly assess the problem or become unwilling to work with the woman because she is being perceived as resistant, defiant, or unpleasant to engage. In addition, some black women may not be perceived as needing help because their masks may not demonstrate a high risk to the worker. It is critical to identify the use of the mask and then figure out how it can be used to address the situation at hand. Finally, assessment tools and protocols are often ill-prepared to deal with these complex issues and realities. Current assessment tools and protocols often require that women share " the problem " within a specified timeline( Boyd-Franklin, 2006). Without respect for the sensitivity of the information being sought and the need to develop trust and a working relationship to ask the question, the process can then fuel the woman 's sense of mistrust because it could appear that the system is ill-equipped to deal with the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2005a). In addition, the assessment could be faulty, incomplete, or both, diminishing the effectiveness of the assessment. Tools that include a focus on cultural influences and strengths are needed to create more informed and more accurate assessments( Boyd-Franklin, 2006 ; Hill, 1999). However, there are other issues of assessment to consider. How and when questions are asked is worthy of greater attention. It is insufficient to expect that a woman of color will divulge GBV within the context of living in a racist, sexist, and oppressive environment without considering the potential risks( Bent-Goodley, 2004). Assessment must take place within this context. There should be more time to develop the relationship( Boyd-Franklin, 2006). Other assessment strategies should include an honest discussion of issues of race and discrimination and their impact on the helping relationship and the perception of the situation( C. West, 2003). Assessment should also include an acknowledgment of stereotypes that affect a woman 's experiences and her perceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). The practitioner may find that the woman may not say how she truly feels to be socially acceptable or to not offend the practitioner. This decision can affect the flow and accuracy of communication and inhibit obtaining critical information. Finally, issues of separation and loss should also be discussed to not just include individuals lost through death, but also individuals lost through other means, such as abandonment( Brice, 1999 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005). Concept Two : Mourning Mourning " pertains to a collective effort to overcome grief and involves a collective process of identification, empathy, and catharsis "( Martin &; Martin, 1995, p. 15). The mourning concept encompasses the problem-solving process and focuses on collective healing in the black community. The mourning process addresses the problem of hopelessness by providing relief and instilling hope among individuals and the larger community. Part of diminishing the secrecy and shame associated with GBV is helping those within the community to understand the concept of vulnerability, which is the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and oppression( Hill, 1999 ; Martin &; Martin, 1995 ; Schiele, 2000). Finally, there is the idea that there are hidden injuries of race that often are not apparent but are present in each human interaction. Consequently, the color-blind approach counters effectively meeting the needs of the individual and the community( Bent-Goodley, 2005b ; Gondolf &; Williams, 2001). The hidden injuries of race result in many African Americans feeling suspicion when working with formal service providers. The client may be reserved about sharing personal experiences and pain because of fear of being further isolated or viewed negatively by the practitioner( Boyd-Franklin, 2006). These types of issues can become so challenging that many African American clients try to ignore racial issues for fear of rejection, lack of validation, and further alienation. The cumulative effect of these components is the inability to mourn. Mourning is critical, as it represents a time when the person can be reaffirmed, where the problem can be reexamined and redefined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, address the problem, and eventually heal( Martin &; Martin, 1995). Without the ability to mourn, the person might feel a profound and staggering sense of hopelessness and emotional vulnerability. In application, Martin and Martin( 2005) stressed that the goal of the mourning process is cultural versatility, not social adaptation. The social worker is encouraged to examine the problem of loss, separation and trauma, and the historical and economic nature of the individual 's problems( Brice, 1999 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005), with an emphasis on a collective approach, to include informal networks and mutual aid groups. The social worker is encouraged to help the client recognize barriers, to facilitate a collective approach, and to bring individual pain to the surface so that there can be a collective reaffirmation, reexamination of the problem, and redefining of the issues. Ultimately, the social worker is helping to instill hope by earning the client 's trust and showing evidence of an emotional commitment to the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The social worker is called to ensure that the intervention is culturally relevant, addresses issues of separation and loss, and helps to instill hope within the individual and the community( Martin &; Martin, 1995). The mourning process reminds us that there can not be a color-blind approach to addressing GBV. It is insufficient to think that all black women experience GBV in the same way. Instead, the approach must respect the diversity among black women both as an ethnic group and as individuals, acknowledging that there may be central experiences and strengths within the black experience that lend themselves to intervention( Bent-Goodley, 2005b ; T. West, 1999). Cultural relevance, in this context, would incorporate the use of mutual aid groups and informal systems into the intervention. Social workers can work with community- and faith-based organizations to develop creative solutions and mechanisms to address GBV( Bent-Goodley &; Fowler, 2006). They can also support indigenous practices and help to validate those practices that have been developed in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Being culturally relevant is bigger than having pictures of African Americans on the walls or having frontline African American staff. Cultural relevance includes furthering the advancement of people of color who understand culturally specific practice and the cultural context, in senior administrative and board roles, and creating administrative policies that respect the culture. In short, people of color should be represented within the full spectrum of decision making, with policies and programs to foster an environment open to diversity and change( Bent-Goodley, 2005b). Having people of color in leadership roles does not mean that they are the only ones capable of providing such services. All practitioners, regardless of race, ethnicity, or role in an agency, should be held accountable for providing services that are culturally relevant to the population being served. Because separation and loss are central to understanding BEBSW, grief therapy is an essential component that can be used to address the problem. Grief therapy and the mourning process must acknowledge and incorporate cultural influences, reflect an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on cultural strengths( Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005). The woman could be grieving the loss of a relationship, companionship, or having another person to help with parenting. Although the woman wants the violence to stop, she could also feel a loss, nonetheless, from an emotional and economic standpoint. It is important to acknowledge this separation and loss within the context of the cultural and historical experience. In addition, many black women choose not to talk about the violence they have experienced for fear of bringing shame to the family and community, because they do not want " everyone in their business, " or to protect the man( Bent-Goodley, 2001 ; C. West, 2003 ; T. West, 1999). It should be understood and relayed that there are cultural dynamics associated with grief and mourning( Brice, 1999 ; Moore &; Bryant, 2003 ; Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005). There are also cultural strengths and tools associated with addressing issues of separation and loss that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she can heal in the future. Culturally based grief therapy must address all types of separation and loss, including non-death loss, from a cultural perspective. There is a cultural perspective to addressing separation and loss that is unique for African Americans and " often entangled with issues of racism and discrimination "( Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005, p. 168). This cultural perspective " refers to distinctively African American music, religious institutions, community life, values, culturally meaningful historical events and processes, foods, historically important and contemporary leaders, writings and much else "( Rosenblatt &; Wallace, 2005, p. 168). It is vital to find ways to instill hope. Although a practitioner does not want to instill false hope, it is difficult for him or her to help people believe in the possibility of change if they do not see a part of the practitioner 's role as instilling hope. To instill hope, it is necessary to influence those systems that stifle hope. It is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To instill hope, one must have a vision, something to work toward that transcends the situation and points to a brighter future. To instill hope, one must be prepared to engage those systems that challenge the growth and potential of those who are oppressed. The social worker 's role is to instill hope for the individual and the community. Instilling hope does not mean that the worker should make promises or break professional boundaries ; instead, the worker should recognize the possibilities in a given situation. The worker then must convey this information to the client and create similar communications to the community. In addition, the practitioner is required to understand that the client empowers herself and that through the practitioner 's knowledge, skill, and enthusiasm, he or she can help the client connect or reconnect to her sense of power and potential( Bent-Goodley, 2005a). Instilling hope is an important emphasis of the morning phase, and it is accomplished when the individual and collective empowerment of the group is targeted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that addressing the problem is worthy of all of us. Concept Three : Morning " Mornin '... represents a significant breakthrough, the arrival of a brighter day, a new beginning, a transformation, or a change "( Martin &; Martin, 1995, p. 15). The goal of the morning concept is to strengthen the capacity of black people to face their problems and take action toward collective social, economic, and political empowerment that leads to social change. In application, the focus of the morning process is to foster the healing and growth of the community through collective empowerment. The role of the social worker is to help the client strengthen his or her sense of identity and connectedness to the community and historical legacy( Carlton-LaNey, 2001 ; Hill, 1999 ; Schiele, 2000). In addition, advocacy targeted toward social and economic change is emphasized as a means to foster the empowerment of the black community. The morning phase emphasizes the need for practitioners to invest in the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help her find ways to heal from violence. Indeed, the BEBSW approach stresses that knowledge of historical and contemporary events must translate into applied approaches to address the vestiges of generational oppression( Bent-Goodley, 2005b). It is critical to include the community, as the woman defines it, through community education and organizing. This helps the community to not relegate violence against women and girls as a problem rooted in gender alone, but to also acknowledge the far-reaching impact of GBV so that it is not considered a woman 's issue only, but also a community issue( Bent-Goodley, 2005a ; T. West, 1999). The safety and protection of women and girls must be paramount, but its connection to the survival and strength of communities and nations must also be highlighted. The social worker must go beyond the individual and also serve as an advocate for policy and programmatic change on multilevels. Social workers are needed to strengthen advocacy efforts in this area and to broaden the discussion to include the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding ways to address the intersections of oppression( Davis &; Bent-Goodley, 2004). Social workers are uniquely positioned to foster greater dialogue and efforts to address GBV as the social work profession has a focus on social and economic justice. Understanding the direct service needs of this population, social workers are intimately aware of the broad spectrum of systemic needs and challenges experienced by this population ; consequently, they can serve as optimal advocates who can illuminate issues unknown to others, more efficiently mobilize those within the population, and intently influence necessary systems to better serve this population. It is critical that the community education process take place on multiple levels. The immediate community must be engaged. If a woman is being served in a community, then community education should ensue to facilitate collective affirmation. The communal approach has been acknowledged as a key cultural strength and an opportunity for social workers to better engage and respond to issues within African American communities( Carlton-LaNey, 2001 ; Harvey, 2001 ; Hill, 1999 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows social workers to develop sustainable responses to stopping violence within these communities. It further creates opportunities for community accountability regarding this issue. Culturally specific community education approaches are necessary to more effectively educate communities about this issue and to ensure their support in stopping the violence. These approaches must be specific to the community and recognize the residents ' diverse cultural thoughts and experiences. Community education provides a viable opportunity for social workers to fortify their response to GBV and create lasting solutions in response to this issue. CONCLUSION BEBSW provides a means of examining GBV from a culturally specific perspective and offers ways of responding to GBV. Using a black perspective, BEBSW roots the assessment, interventions, and healing from within a culturally responsive framework that posits change on multiple levels, including the individual, family, community, and societal levels. The BEBSW approach offers a framework to better understand how GBV is unique within the black experience. The approach reinforces the importance of instilling hope and addressing issues of separation and loss, both through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on culturally specific grief and community education approaches that evidence respect and awareness of the diversity, strengths, and challenges within this population. Social workers are uniquely and irreplaceably prepared to address the problem of GBV by offering new culturally specific strategies, enhanced advocacy, and greater awareness of this issue. The author thanks Dr. Joanne Martin and, in memoriam, Dr. Elmer Martin for laying such a critical foundation for many social work students to build on for the future.
