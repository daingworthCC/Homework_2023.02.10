4018541 In this article, I will examine the continuities and discontinuities in the Western ethical tradition with respect to its understanding of the nature and role of the warrior. I will suggest that Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Machiavelli, Kant, and Nietzsche each contribute to the contemporary understanding of the warrior and his morality. However, none presents what we take to be a complete picture. Rather, our views are a blend of classical and modem elements, and these views change and tend to emphasize various components of classical or modem philosophy, depending on our level of optimism or cynicism, with respect to foreign affairs and the role of the United States in the world order. I believe it is the case that virtually all of the common perspectives on these matters have a serious intellectual pedigree, whether or not the contemporary exponents of these perspectives realize it. Further, I will argue that the military, in its own interests, should articulate a clear moral self-understanding and, to the extent possible, act on this self-understanding in the education particularly of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral philosophy, as a systematic mode of inquiry and body of knowledge, was invented in Greece in the fifth century BC. Ethics first came to sight, paradoxically, in the form of an attack on existing codes of morality. It was an attack launched by the so-called Sophists, who were itinerant lecturers - professors - of the ancient Greek world. The Sophist Protagoras maintained that moral codes were purely conventional creations, useful to human life but not grounded in nature or any ultimate truth. A form of ethical or moral relativism was therefore extant in ancient Greece ; it is certainly not something the West, or Americans, invented in the 1960s. More radical Sophists extended this insight of Protagoras by claiming that, since morality is only conventional, it ought not to be binding. In this view, rationality points to pursuing one 's own interests, however moral or immoral they may appear to be. As the Sophist Thrasymachus claims in Plato 's Republic, our goal should be to extend our interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away with it. So one might say that a form of realism, or realpolitik, also has distant origins. <p> Since the 1960s, in the name of attacking our Western conception of justice, and in the tradition of Thrasymachus, we have sometimes heard cynical paraphrases of Chairman Mao : " justice comes from the barrel of a gun. " Alas, if justice does come only from the barrel of a gun, the morality of the warrior is a simple one : become the most effective soldier, the most efficient purveyor of one 's will or the will of one 's superiors, that one can possibly be. In addition, we( at least most of us, certain strains of postmodernism notwithstanding) tend not to think that justice or morality reduces to power. We tend to think, with Plato, that right conduct is rooted somehow in the nature of things and is a function neither of conventional views nor raw power. <p> Plato tried to address the Sophists by suggesting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that results. According to Plato, reason, spiritedness, and desire should be blended in due measure. Behaving unethically is understood, in general, to be a result of allowing desire or the passions to triumph over the golden, ductile cord of reason. By behaving ethically, one comports oneself with a standard that is both intrinsically good and that, from a utilitarian point of view, leads to a harmony of the soul and of society - which is, according to Plato, the human soul writ large. <p> Of the divisions of the soul, the spirited or thymotic part is perhaps the most relevant to the warrior, an idea recently commented upon in some detail by Francis Fukuyama. 1 Spirit, or thymos, seems related to the Aristotelian virtue of courage, although it is not simply this. The warrior class in the Republic is, primarily, blessed with thymos. The warriors will mount a courageous defense of their city, and their courage will be elevated and sustained by a spirited love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the form of righteous indignation toward those who would destroy what they hold most dear - their laws, their mores, their morality, which are encapsulated and given life by their city. The enemy attacks not just the nation, as it were, but the warrior, on a very personal level. By defending the political order, the warrior defends himself. In the warrior, private spiritedness becomes a public virtue. The seeming tension - so common in contemporary Western societies - between the private and the public, between personal desire and social flourishing, is overcome in the archetype of the warrior. <p> But thymos does more than bridge the public/private gap. It can also, somewhat paradoxically, be an aid to reason and ethics. 2 It can perform this function on an individual level insofar as one can become indignant toward oneself when, for example, one follows the pull of a powerful appetite - perhaps sexual desire - when one knows it to be wrong. <p> In a societal sense, thymos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the Utopia that Plato recognizes can be constructed in theory only.( This theoretical construction is in fact Plato 's task in the Republic). Even such a perfect city, after all, requires a warrior class to defend it against its enemies. A Utopia, with what Plato thinks to be the best system of citizen training, will still be confronted by those who would seek to destroy it. Hence the ineluctable need for the warriors. Plato, even in his most Utopian moments, never wished simply to give peace a chance. <p> Aristotle, too, connects the notion of individual moral virtue with social well-being. In fact, Aristotle views ethics as being a mere subset of politics, which is the master science of the human good. Politics, properly understood, provides the possibile conditions, including especially citizen education, necessary for human beings to achieve happiness. Happiness, the ultimate purpose of human life, comes from the practice of moral and intellectual virtue, over a full lifetime. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, inculcated by proper habits. Happiness, therefore, has objective content ; it is not the relativist construct of individual human beings. <p> This ancient account of politics is of course very different from that of modem philosophical liberalism, which would either deny politics any role in the good, or try to limit that role dramatically. For Aristotle, the good of the community is higher and more noble than the good of the individual. And I would suggest that some form of this notion is essential to any military ethic. One might therefore say that a proper military ethic is, in decisive respects, essentially premodern. A proper military ethic is bound to encounter difficulties as it tries to make its peace with the modem liberal state. In James Toner 's words, the military ethic is " at odds with the basic tenor and the fundamental tenets of a progressively inclined, liberally concerned, democratically structured civil order. " 3 The best we can hope for is to strive, imperfectly, for that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 <p> Aristotle is grating to the modem sensibility in other ways. In his emphasis on moral virtues rooted in character, he would be hostile to modem accounts of politics that try to raise a firm distinction between character and competence, character and technical expertise, or character and genuine " issues. " For him, right conduct always depends on character. To those who would deemphasize character as the fundamental ordering concept of military or ethical life, Aristotle would say they 've got it wrong ; in fact, they 've got almost everything wrong. He would also be hostile to an overemphasis on modem rule ethics - many derivatives of which are so common in military life. Laws, rules, and regulations are never sufficient to govern a good person 's actions, which are dependent upon the moral virtues - which dictate the ends of human action - plus the intellectual virtue of prudence, which dictates the means to those ends. <p> Of the many individual moral virtues with which Aristotle deals, the virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthy of special comment from the point of view of the morality of the warrior. While courage is obviously critical to the warrior, high-mindedness is a more encompassing virtue. It is a virtue that seems to be related to great affairs of state and the like. As Aristotle says, " A man is regarded as high-minded when he thinks he deserves great things and actually deserves them. " 5 It is the mean, the midpoint, between foolish vanity and small-mindedness. Those who are small-minded think of themselves as undeserving and therefore do not pursue great things. Those who are vain - a not uncommon vice in both the military and civilian worlds - think they are great when in fact they are not. The high-minded person thinks himself great, 6 and actually is. <p> The high-minded person is concerned with the greatest of external goods - honor, a tribute normally paid to the gods, from which he derives some pleasure. 7 A high-minded person has perfected the virtues - courage, justice, moderation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to whom nothing is great. It seems that there might be statesmen or military leaders who embody high-mindedness, or magnanimity, in this Aristotelian sense. Abraham Lincoln and, more recently, Winston Churchill, come to mind. And I would suggest that this crown of the virtues 8 might also be the perfect expression of the military ethic. <p> And this, perhaps, is the most positive language we have to express our understanding of the warrior morality. When we are most optimistic and confident about our national purposes, when we are burdened with a war that, nevertheless, most think to be a just war, when we can speak with one voice about the military, it is then that we see the warrior as the great-souled individual, the magnanimous man, in Aristotle 's terms, possessed of all the moral and intellectual virtues ; the magnanimous man whose thymos causes him to rise and defend the city on a hill, the city that reflects the proper balance among reason, thymos, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way, the perfect Republic. <p> In these moments of optimism, the West 's predominantly Christian tradition does not get in the way of the celebration of, indeed, the reveling in, the warrior morality. Since St. Augustine in the fourth century AD, it has been clear that a Christian can argue plausibly and rationally for the compatibility of religious doctrine and warrior morality. The Bible, according to Augustine, requires us to turn the other cheek only in the sense of our inward dispositions, not our actions in the world. Not war, but the love of war, is a sin. Says Augustine, PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In terms of the secular world, the Bible is as much directed toward justice as forgiveness. Just war is permissible, and is demanded, in certain circumstances. The earthly city, while inferior to the city of God, is nevertheless good, and worthy of protection, because it allows us to enjoy the earthly goods. Even the faithful, who are members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the secular world. They must seek the peace that it offers. This means that laws must be obeyed, and the wicked must be restrained. This is one of the primary tasks of the earthly city and its coercive government - it deals in a concrete way with our fallen nature. As Augustine so beautifully puts it. PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> So, as I have said, religious faith has not necessarily been understood to interfere with our most sanguine assessments of the warrior. But when, by contrast, we are pessimistic and lack confidence in national purposes, when we are burdened with a war we consider unjust, when we can not be sure of how we ought to think about the military, we tend to fall back on a very different, more modem conception of the warrior. It is modem in that the language and framework of our conception date not from antiquity, but from the early sixteenth century. It is the language of Niccolo Machiavelli. <p> I have spoken to this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aristotle on the one hand, and Christianity on the other. Machiavelli attacked both of these traditions as inadequate and positively misleading. He did so most famously in The Prince, the most famous book on politics ever written. Only the Republic comes close, and it turns out to discuss politics in the context of something higher than politics-philosophy. 11 For Plato and Aristotle, politics had an ultimately subordinate place to philosophical wisdom ; not so in The Prince, where everything of importance is political. <p> Machiavelli 's response to the central ideas of classical and Christian virtue is that, if one looks at necessity, one sees that both are defective. Virtue leads to ruin in politics. Machiavelli therefore changes the focus of political and social inquiry from the end of human life - human perfection by way of virtue - to the beginnings, the circumstances of basic day-to-day existence and struggle. Machiavelli sees regimes primarily as new or old, not as good or evil. To found a regime, he claims, one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is politics - or the new science of politics - which is what we commonly understand as politics today. The end justifies the means used by a politician to get what he or she wants. Our dismissive phrase, " It 's just politics, " is Machiavellian in origin. <p> The Prince was a new kind of book. It claimed that necessity conflicts with virtue, and that people, especially princes, must sometimes act immorally. Machiavelli therefore redefines virtue. The old definition was moral virtue ; his new definition is courage and wile in the service of acquisition. The new virtue is most appropriate for new principalities. Old principalities can in a way afford to be moral in the old sense ; new ones can not. Hereditary princes are dependent on old and established expectations, people, laws, customs, and traditions for their success. 12 Nonhereditary princes - new founders or conquerors - can depend only on themselves. Only armed prophets will succeed ; unarmed prophets will not. <p> I do not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristotle and St. Augustine - were ignorant of, or ignored, the fact that many actual regimes were founded in bloodshed. In the City of God, Augustine makes much of the fact that the parent of humanity and communal life - the founder of the very first city - was Cain. He of course slew his brother Abel ; he belonged therefore to the corrupt city of man, not the city of God. The first city was founded on a fratricide. So too was Rome, when Remus was slain by his brother Romulus. The classical account of human nature was not so dissimilar to Samuel P. Huntington 's renowned characterization of the military ethic, which " emphasizes the permanence, irrationality, weakness, and evil in human nature. " 13 <p> But Machiavelli takes Augustine 's insight to a new level. He makes it the bedrock of his political science - a bedrock from which we can not - indeed, dare not - even try to distance ourselves. For St. Augustine, after all, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so for Machiavelli. <p> Machiavelli says that crimes and cruelties can be badly or well used. 14 The lesson is not that crime does not pay, only that the prince must use cruelties to his benefit. This means doing evil things up front and all at once, while spreading benefits out over time, because people have short memories. <p> How does one establish a new republic? Machiavelli claims it is by way of crime. Rome, for example, was founded in criminality, but later came to be regarded as great and just. Given enough time, regimes do come to be so regarded, but all regimes are founded on cruelty initially ; it is the only way to found. Veneration for a regime grows only with time, when the cruelties are lost in the mists of history. <p> So what is our cynical conception of the warrior morality, drawn from Machiavelli? When we wish to be reductionist about the aims of politics, our archetypical warrior is Machiavelli 's Remirro de Oreo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors understand and apply <p> Machiavelli 's new definition of virtue. Remirro, who is described by Machiavelli as a " cruel and ready man, " 15 was assigned, according to Machiavelli, to pacify a territory. He was given by the prince " the fullest power, " 16 a power of which he took full advantage. <p> In the aftermath of this exercise of power, Cesare Borgia - the very prince who ordered Remirro to do his dirty deeds - realizes he will be hated by the people unless he makes a show of getting rid of his consummate warrior, Remirro. PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Machiavelli 's point( in addition to his less than flattering commentary on the nature of the people and public opinion) is that the art of ruthless war, and ruthlessness in general, is essential to command. Principalities must be able to defend themselves. To rely only on God, or on a misguided conception of morality, leads to slavery and misery. <p> In chapter 15 of The Prince, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new principality, which is modernity itself. He declares his intention " to depart from the orders of others " 18 - particularly others such as Plato who, according to Machiavelli, only imagines republics that have never been realized in actuality. Machiavelli sees himself as ushering in the modem project - he is a sort of prophet or founder of this new way of understanding politics, and of war in the pursuit of political aims. It is an age in which we, in our cynical moods, understand with Machiavelli that it is better to be feared than loved, for love is fickle, fear eternal. Machiavelli paved the way for our seeing the warrior merely as a violent tool of the prince. <p> Machiavelli severed the connection between politics, war, and human happiness. Happiness was central for Aristotle, who thought there was no community just because a group of individuals banded together to seek mere self-preservation. By cutting politics off from the deepest human concerns - virtue, the good life, theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contemporary rights-based politics, wherein virtue plays a very modest role indeed. <p> Machiavelli points us to the low, not the high. The ancients certainly knew there were low aspects to human nature, but thought the high - reason and virtue - could dominate the low passions if human beings were given the right training and habituation. Machiavelli, along with, perhaps, most who have followed him, prefer to rely on low but solid foundations. Machiavelli tells the prince not to reach high, as did the ancient or Christian philosophers, because, if he does, he will get burned. Peace and the preservation of the principality are the only truly worthy human goals that remain. And many means are unleashed when the ends of human life are so defined. <p> It is interesting to reflect on the fact that Machiavelli meant to shock. Today, we are so used to hearing arguments that " the ends justify the means, " so used to hearing dismissive attacks on traditional notions of morality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. At the time he wrote, however, he was shocking. The fact that we no longer find him so - most analysts today apply to Machiavelli relatively neutral adjectives - certainly not " shocking " or " amoral " - this fact reveals something about ourselves. It reveals that, in a way, Machiavelli has won. His language of politics and martial virtue is now a commonplace. <p> We should not conclude without reflecting on the Enlightenment and the reaction to it. Immanuel Kant, the Enlightenment philosopher par excellence, has bequeathed us a way of viewing the warrior morality that is still very much with us. Blended with certain strains of contemporary Christian theology, it is a powerful vision. According to Kant, the only good in the world is the good will. In practice, this points to conforming our actions to a universal law. It means that one should " act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense. He says that moral action can take no account of consequences. This absolutism sometimes finds expression in pacifism. If it is wrong to borrow money without the intention of returning it( Kant 's example), it is absolutely wrong, no matter what the consequences of doing without the money. If it is wrong to wage war( in Kant 's ideal future of perpetual peace), it is absolutely wrong, no matter what the consequences. <p> We can see in Kant some of the roots of contemporary pacifism, 20 which sees the warrior only in terms of one who routinely violates or is prepared to violate, as part of his profession, the most absolute of all categorical imperatives. Again, in times that are dominated by an equivocal sense of our national purpose, many of us become simplified Kantians. Some of us claim that war is wrong because it conflicts with Christian principles, 21 which admonish us to turn the other cheek. But this ignores St. Augustine, among others. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sufficiently perspicacious when it comes to questions of war and peace. But nevertheless, from the perspective of the Enlightenment, the warrior becomes, if not Machiavelli 's grotesque tool of sovereign will, then at least an anachronism - an artifact of a pre-Enlightenment hell when the world did not realize the badness of war, or the possibilities of purely good will. <p> Finally, a word about Nietzsche. By the nineteenth century when Nietzsche wrote, the Enlightenment, and Christianity itself, were under intense assault, especially by German thinkers. For Nietzsche, Kant 's categorical imperative, insofar as it demands conduct that is universalizable and available to all rational beings, is " a Moloch of abstraction " 22 which destroys the possibility of great or noble individual action. Nietzsche damns the good will and celebrates action that overcomes all conventional, egalitarian moralities. <p> Machiavelli 's attempt at realpolitik - cutting politics off from a common morality - reaches its ultimate expression in Nietzsche 's aristocratic reaction to Enlightenment liberalism. In Nietzsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low morality of mere self-preservation - is celebrated for its own sake. Aesthetics replace morals. Self-expressive individualism emerges full-blown. <p> And the politics of self-expression are indeed unstable ; one can not predict just what a self, divorced from traditional, unchanging constraints of virtue, of morality, might wish to express. But even if the politics of the self do not create a Hitler, even if they do not open a new moral space for a Hitler to come into being, they at least undermine the traditional language in which we might condemn a Hitler. <p> Nietzsche says that most individuals share a contemptible herd morality of self-preservation. Only times of war remind them of the need for strong individuals to rise above the pack. Jack Nicholson 's courtroom scene in the film A Few Good Men brilliantly reminds us of this. In its campy Hollywood way, it captures a serious, Nietzschean criticism of liberal morality. The scene, while not legally realistic, is philosophically compelling. <p> Nicholson plays U.S. Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the herd morality - a blue Navy lawyer played by Tom Cruise - that, deep down inside, at a level Cruise and people like him will not admit exists at their cocktail parties, he. Cruise, is thankful that there are men warriors such as Jessup patrolling the walls that protect the herd from predators. What Colonel Jessup actually does to ensure that those walls are protected is not, from the colonel 's point of view, important. It must be said that the colonel is not a pure Nietzschean in that he does have the physical well-being of the herd at heart ; he is not committed solely to his own creative freedom.( Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now is a purer Nietzschean - the horror for him is not war, but the entire world he has created, wherein he becomes as a god.) <p> In A Few Good Men, nevertheless, it is the reality of being above the herd that appears to be the most important thing to the man that Nathan Jessup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the film and is hauled off to jail, as he must be in a liberal society. But this is not to say, I think, that his essentially Nietzschean critique of contemporary morality does not have bite. <p> The true warrior, according to Nietzsche, can not be constrained to the preservation of the very herd for whom he has only a mixture of contempt and pity. Of warriors, Nietzsche says. PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> And this too is one of our visions of the warrior - the warrior as pure expression of will ; the warrior as wolf in a herd of sheep, overcoming and eating all we hold dear ; the warrior as criminal of the most horrific sort - the criminal who acts in furtherance of an agenda wholly his own. This warrior does not act even for the sake of Machiavelli 's goal of forced pacification, which, after all, has a certain kind of rudimentary logic. Instead, the warrior becomes madman. <p> One could of course say more about other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the military ethos. But by now, I hope I have demonstrated my central point : we rely, whether we are conscious of it or not, on a rich philosophical vocabulary to describe the warrior morality. We, as a society, choose our language oftentimes on the basis of the prejudices of the day. Most people have always done this, and will continue to do it. But the philosopher and, I dare say, the warrior, must be more careful. For them, it is important, intellectually and practically, 24 to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their descriptive statements ; in other words, to see them not simply as statements, but as ways of expressing the underlying truth of the virtues, or vices, of the military profession. Military Ethics in a Civilian World <p> Let me conclude by discussing what I believe ought to be seen as the military 's - especially the American military 's - goals and limits in this ethical context. There is no serious dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate to civilian authority. There is still not much serious dispute over the fact that the military ethic, and the virtues associated with it, are in fact different from a civilian ethic and civilian virtues. As I have suggested, there is an important sense in which the military ethic is premodern, regardless of the particular ethical picture we choose to paint of the warrior. The military ethic will always be, if not at war, then at least in some measure of tension with the modem liberal state. <p> I have up to now kept my discussion of ethics on a philosophical plane ; I now want to ground the discussion in as practical and concrete a manner as possible. In particular, I want to address the question of ethical education for members of the military, and especially for military officers. It is, after all, one thing to understand the philosophical vocabulary we rely on when we describe the morality of the warrior, and quite another to understand the implications of this vocabulary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior at the micro level. <p> In David Donovan 's memoir of the Vietnam War, Once a Warrior King, 25 we are introduced to a particular warrior - a young soldier who in some ways turns out to be precisely a " warrior king. " As a first lieutenant, Donovan arrives in Vietnam to act as military advisor to local villagers and soon finds himself master of a small universe : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Such amazing power of life and death might seem to be a recipe for Nietzschean madness, but in Donovan 's hands the power is exercised largely in accordance with Aristotelian moral virtue and prudence. For example, remembering the instructions in duty and courage he received from one of his training officers, he exercises remarkable leadership at moments of great peril. " When all the chips are down, when the privates wo n't move and the sergeants wo n't move and fear has taken over everything, all the responsibility falls on your shoulders. That 's why you have the commission and they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, now you have to pay your dues. " 27 <p> In so many ways, and in unimaginably bizarre circumstances, Donovan seems to find just the right Aristotelian mean. He exercises the virtue of gentleness, showing neither short temper nor apathy ; friendliness, being neither obsequious nor dyspeptic ; and truthfulness in his social relations, being neither boasting nor self-deprecating. Likewise, his self-control - though occasionally he seems to lose it - is nevertheless generally splendid in the circumstances. Once a Warrior King can be read as a kind of case study in Aristotelian ethics in extreme military situations( and this indeed is how I encourage my graduate students to read it). <p> Even Donovan 's occasional deviations from a happy mean seem only to emphasize how close he comes to getting it right. In exemplifying the military virtue of loyalty( so important for Admiral Stockdale and others), Donovan is perhaps too loyal to the incompetent " Captain Jackson, " who, through both gross negligence and violation of the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be a virtue in Aristotle 's terms, it would be a mean( between the vices of blind loyalty and betrayal). No one could accuse Donovan of betrayal, but, in his decision with respect to Captain Jackson, he might slip into the vice at the other extreme : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Even though, in the end, Donovan goes out of his way to ignore Jackson 's misdeed, it is clear that he is himself unsure of whether or not he has found the happy midpoint( as, indeed, are we). <p> It seems that, despite the military 's necessary emphasis on rules and absolute principles of duty, virtue ethics are still needed by many warriors in many circumstances( particularly in the circumstances of the " traditional " battlefield, as opposed to the circumstances of the detached techno-warrior, for whom rules and simple principles will likely be of primary importance). In short, Aristotle 's ethical framework still, practically speaking, provides a good account of the warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we - inculcate such an ethical understanding? <p> It is certainly the case that, in the United States, military education at the undergraduate, professional, and graduate levels takes ethics seriously. Of course, this education is directed primarily at officers rather than enlisted personnel, and it is largely, of necessity, highly concentrated " book learning. " However, it is far from clear that many of Donovan 's responses to his unique situations were governed by such book learning. They were, rather, conditioned by the apparently proper habituation he received, throughout his life, prior to become an officer in the field. This is eminently Aristotelian, but perhaps disturbing for that reason. For Aristotle, as I have mentioned, one is habituated to virtuous behavior over the course of one 's entire life, until such behavior becomes automatic ; it ceases to require specific incentives or rational calculations. And it certainly can not be " learned " just by taking a course or two - or, indeed, many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right family structure, the right mores, the right kind of society that takes the habituation of its citizens seriously. <p> In this sense, Toner 29 is not out of keeping with Aristotle when he points to the disjunction between the military world-view( pessimistic and collectivist, among other things) versus the American civilian world-view( optimistic, individualist, among other things). The military world-view is perhaps most cogently and famously presented by Huntington, who marks out officership as a profession, apart from the mores of nonprofessionals( especially civilian nonprofessionals). In this view, the military mind must be understood, and judged, according to relatively unchanging professional standards. The officer has a professional ethic - conservative realism - in the same way a lawyer or doctor has a definable ethic. <p> But this ethic seems to have limitations. It can perhaps be too cautious, oblivious to larger( and legitimate) political or moral concerns. It may require correction by society outside the military profession, if that society has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toner indeed seems to counsel against a wholehearted embrace of either the military or civilian world-view, but rather for an appropriate balance between the two. The result, as I mentioned earlier, is his appreciation of that " magnificent anomaly, " the " democratic soldier. " The democratic soldier will reject, and know when to reject, an illegal order because he is ethical( not merely the possessor of a military ethos) and because he is American, which implies a sense of fair play and respect for proportion in all things( an Aristotelian mean, as it were). <p> At the macro or command level, the question for Toner is not whether the soldier has no political involvement or substantial political involvement, but what kind of involvement there will be( MacArthur in Japan - good, or MacArthur in Korea - bad). Professionalism, in short, always involves moral/political judgments( not merely technical skill in the execution of the soldier 's primary task - killing the enemy and controlling territory) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new millennium is, really, whether it can support Toner 's interpretation, or whether it will throw up enough counterexamples to put Toner 's optimism about the democratic soldier, if not his ideals, into question. <p> Malham M. Wakin also recognizes, sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly, the enduring value of an Aristotelian version of the ethics of leadership, albeit with some caveats for American military practices and the American military ethic. 30 Character is a habitual whole, developed over a lifetime. One looks to a good man as a model and military leaders in particular must exemplify moral virtue. Practical moral obligations are neither absolute( thou shalt not intentionally kill) nor relative( everything in life depends on " where you 're coming from "). 31 There are universal obligations that are nonsubjective, nonrelative, but they may conflict with one another ; how these obligations are to be obeyed depends on the circumstances( although for each set of circumstances there is a naturally right course of action). According to Wakin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be comprehensive statements of what honor requires, single out lying, cheating, and stealing as " act-types " that are strictly forbidden. This is an Aristotelian approach to character-building that helps make honesty the automatic response of every cadet. 32 It remains the case that certain features of military life, from honor codes to simple mottoes such as " duty, honor, country, " attempt to step into the breach to compensate, in effect, for the defects of the larger society 's system of habituation, on which the military must of necessity rely for its young officers-to-be. These features point to the need for integrity in systems - including of course the military system itself - rife with incentives for careerism and worse( especially as the essentially civilian management ethos gains pride of place in military thinking). Military life, from its beginnings in the military colleges onward, attempts to encourage habits of mind and action that help develop a character that would be pleasing to Aristotle. PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> I would suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in certain circumstances, must have, an essentially Aristotelian moral compass. However, this is not a moral compass that the military can fully inculcate in its officers, much less in its enlisted personnel. 34 The military ultimately draws from, and is a reflection of, the society of which it is a part. <p> So the challenge to the military is great indeed. Only if the military can maintain ethical standards that are, we may say, slightly more demanding and elevated than those of the civilian world, yet not in fundamental conflict with that world, can it maintain its professional independence. Jacques Barzun notably claimed of the professions that they are destroyed from within. When they lose competence and moral legitimacy, they invite control by outsiders ; they invite being treated as mere trades or businesses. To the extent that the military comes under the undue control of outsiders, to the extent that the military is treated as a mere trade onto which the standards of the civilian world can be fully superimposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own failure. It will be a result first of the military 's failure to articulate the most noble philosophical essence of the military ethic, and second of its failure to distill this essence into a workable program of military education that, by its nature, can never be fully successful. Nevertheless, it is a program of education that must to some extent demand of its students something that their society, without this articulation of the military ethic - and perhaps even with it - will neither fully comprehend nor fully embrace. <p>
