4004041 Section : The Geographical Review October 1992 <p> ABSTRACT. Columbus is only a small part of the large story that is the quincentenary of 1492. Since publication of " The Early Spanish Main "( 1966) by Carl O. Sauer, geographers have treated the Columbian voyages as the start of a massive intercultural transformation by stressing processes and their effects. Four courses of Columbian scholarship are identified and traced. <p> IN the square of many a small, rustic town of southern and western Spain stands a statue. Anyone consuming a cup of coffee in the cool mornings of early fall can not escape quiet notice of these larger-than-life monuments bearing witness to an era that began five hundred years ago. Usually, the figure wrought in metal is a favored native son who four or five centuries earlier left to explore, invade, and evangelize in a land far away. Not always, though. In some towns the monument is to Columbus, and, by extension, it silently notes the Spanish, Genoese, Portuguese, French, and English entry into the Americas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by curiosity about the exotic or, more likely, by the absence of opportunity at home. <p> Along the main shopping street in Merida, the regional capital of Estremadura, a sign identifies the " Consejeria de Emigracion, " the still-extant official council for emigration. The allure of distant lands drew young people from their birthplaces. After five hundred years, the migration continues, giving a distinctly Old World cast to what the Spanish, with some trepidation, describe as the encuentro( encounter). There is no denying that in 1992 the Spanish village statuary seems a bit brazen, emboldened with extra measures of vigor, meaning, and ambiguity. Yet by comparison, nowhere else is the Columbian legacy accepted so blithely as in Iberia. Especially in the Americas, there is more darkness and less silver to the lining. As all those concerned, however peripherally, weigh in with an interpretation of the significance of 1492, North American geographers too express their opinions. <p> For good and bad, 1992 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorable invasion of a hemisphere began as a formalized process, there is an ongoing and ritual reevaluation of what the encounter has meant to the world. With great talk, and even some documentation, of the nature of the world economy, the influence of the Columbian discovery is perhaps more thoroughly felt now than by any earlier generation. But something else may be true. Discussing the sum total of navigational, economic, historical, genocidal, demographic, and other geographical effects of the invasion of the Americas has tended to be put aside gently in favor of voicing a consensus that acknowledges the political sensitivity of what began in 1492. This is a pity, because the feat of Columbus, accidental or purposeful, terror or triumph, beginning or end, is the geographical fact of the millennium. What else, after all, can compete? <p> Nothing is more impressive about Columbus than the range of sentiments that scholars adopt in writing about this somewhat enigmatic figure. He is hero or fool, a genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have perished at sea. With the quincentenary, and in marked contrast with at least the published responses in the United States in 1892, anti-Columbus sentiment is especially rich ; indigenous responses are many, if often somewhat antihistorical, and every interpretation from revisionist to Gaian eco-feminist to fictional and cinematic has its supporters and, generally, gets a receptive if exhausted hearing. For good measure, there is not even a semblance of agreement as to where Columbus actually made his first landfall in the western hemisphere. If diversity is strength, the foundation for Columbian scholarship in the twenty-first century is massive. <p> Geographers have an unusual role in these discussions. Aside from the range of opinions about Columbus and the Columbian legacy that flows from a subject as diverse and fractious as geography, many geographers have paid special attention to the effects of five hundred years of cultural, biogeographical, economic, ethnographical, and political change. It is this changing view, far from subtle and rich for the mining, that deserves attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- all with much to say about both Columbus and the encounter, and each leading to a different headwater. <p> Starting with " The Early Spanish Main, " by Carl O. Sauer( 1966), geographers have for decades assumed a very different perspective from other writers evaluating Columbus and his work. Instead of hagiography, the geographical view tended toward skepticism about both person and enterprise. First printed in 1966 and reissued with a new foreword in 1992, " The Early Spanish Main " came almost twenty-five years after historian Samuel Eliot Morison( 1942a) published his weighty two-volume biography, " Admiral of the Ocean Sea : A Life of Christopher Columbus. " The viewpoints expressed by Morison and Sauer could hardly have been more different -- surely in part because of the contrasts between a Harvard historian who was an admiral, an Anglophile, and a dedicated sailor, and a Berkeley geographer from the Midwest whose researches were deeply rooted in the rural, native culture of Hispanic America. <p> Morison received a Pulitzer Prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that the full Columbus biography appeared, the Atlantic Monthly Press published an abridged version, lacking notes, some navigational data, a section on sailing ships, and a neatly elided chapter on the origin of syphilis( Morison 1942b). Fifty years later the abridged version is still in print. Morison 's work on Columbus is by no means wrong, either in his long biography or in other books that he produced on Columbian topics. He carefully circumscribed his theme so that the depopulation, the land acquisitiveness and gold lust, the bungled administration, all of which contributed, in Sauer 's view, to the tragedy of the Columbian heritage, drift by as asides in " Admiral of the Ocean Sea " or go unmentioned. <p> There are strengths. Among them are Morison 's archival research, field checking, and clean prose, his admiration for Columbus as a nautical kindred spirit more than four centuries earlier, and a biographer 's proprietary sense of pride in the Columbus who undertook a venture in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve that Morison attributes to Columbus presages the tone of Morison 's later military histories and reflects the completion of the biography during the early years of World War II. Odd, dated touches intrude, such as the note that cruelty to the indigenous residents of Hispaniola " offers a terrible example to Americans who fancy they will be allowed to live in peace by people overseas who covet what they have, " presumably a warning against German aggression( Morison 1942b, 493). The maps for Morison 's study, drawn by Erwin Raisz, then at the Harvard Institute of Geographical Exploration, add a clarity and credibility that remind us of precisely how valuable and insidious handsome maps can be. There is no inkling of the mendacious character, irresolute and nearly incompetent, that Sauer and other authors were to attribute to Columbus. Morison 's Columbus is an eagle-eyed sailor of redoubtable ability and signal purpose. <p> Where Sauer discerned obsession, tragedy, and greed, Morison observes a steadfastness and stability in the " greatest navigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a colonist, did so " partly because his conception of a colony transcended the desire of his followers to impart, and the capacity of natives to receive, the institutions and culture of Renaissance Europe "( Morison 1942b, 670). Indeed, " Admiral of the Ocean Sea " is the sort of solid work to offer anyone who wants more than textbook pablum about Columbus. <p> Morison 's idol as a historian was Francis Parkman, who during the nineteenth century traveled the Plains states by foot, train, and horseback before writing his definitive histories. Morison did the same by sea for his study of Columbus, and in its details of shipboard life, sailing knowledge, and navigation, his work has no equal. Where this monument to the " admiral of the ocean sea " fails is in thought and conception. Morison wanted a visionary hero and found him, skittering over weak moments and unwise decisions, secure in knowing that, long before Morison 's history was completed, Columbus was anointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how much skeptical caviling might go on. The scheme is simple : rely on details of the voyage, keep the narrative focused, dwell on the navigation, and avoid distraction -- present only the facts. <p> " The Early Spanish Main " by Sauer is another matter. After decades of fieldwork in Latin America, Sauer produced a book that either shocked readers into agreement or drove them to rabid dissent. To write such a book in the early 1960s, relying on a detailed analysis of seemingly endless original sources, was daring but flowed from a lifetime of experience. Morison was fifty-five years old when he published the biography of Columbus ; by contrast, Sauer was seventy-seven when " The Early Spanish Main " appeared, with " Sixteenth Century North America "( 1971) and " Seventeenth Century North America "( 1980) to come. Conceptually Sauer 's seminal book differed considerably from that of Morison. Sauer offers geography, a survey of the lands and peoples of the Caribbean and their fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is also biography, then it chronicles a place, not an individual. <p> " That span of a scant thirty years of discovery and domination gave not only geographical but large economic and political directions to Spanish empire, " wrote Sauer( 1966, v) in the foreword. With the opening sentence of the text proper he trumps the ace of many an earlier Columbus scholar : " The geographical preconceptions of Columbus attached the name Indies to the newly discovered lands. " Preconceptions, so the argument goes, are what Columbus and his actions were all about -- a poorly educated man, a mediocre sailor with a genius for dead-reckoning navigation, and a horrid and undisciplined governor of the colonies he greedily sought. <p> Sauer is relentless : though fair, he is unwilling to grant Columbus anything he did not earn. Columbus is a grasping, fanatical figure, " gold obsessed, " in " high spirits, " a person whose report showed that he had " taken off on the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 34). The text moves back and forth, like jump shifts in a suspense novel, between examinations of Caribbean and mainland environments and the machinations of Columbus, infatuated with his contract from the Spanish crown to develop the resources of the " Indies. " Sauer 's historical geography is brilliant and surgical, a dismembering of old truisms long gone gangrenous. He replaces them with a precise view of what, according to contemporary accounts and careful extrapolation from modern knowledge, the land and life of indigenous Americans were like before, during, and after the four voyages of Columbus. <p> Heroism, at least on the part of Columbus, is not in Sauer 's version of the Columbian encounter. " Columbus, " notes Sauer( 1966,290), " gave to Spain a New World the existence of which he never admitted. " He arrived there by mistake or chance, and if he had not arrived first, someone with a different view of exploration and coexistence would shortly have done so. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius for words, not as to their proper meaning but to cast a spell and persuade "( Sauer 1966, 290). But he was a bad governor who learned nothing from experience. When the Spanish government remedied its colonial policy, it did so without his approval and renounced his influence for better-tested schemes. <p> If the judgment rendered by Sauer is harsh, it does not, especially given the ethnographical and ecological information still arriving, overstep its evidence. Although the words are tempered -- Sauer rarely wrote otherwise -- the sting of the prose earned Sauer grudging admiration and some lasting enemies. Reviews of the book were often favorable, including one by J. H. Parry, a colleague of Morison at Harvard University in oceanic history. The Spanish historian Salvador de Madariaga( 1966), evaluating " The Early Spanish Main " for The New York Review of Books, expressed great respect for the passion and precision in the book but, in gentle words, accused Sauer of anti-Spanish bias. <p> And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings old enough to realize that we all belong to mankind, and that though those of us who once went out and trod upon other peoples shall have to lower our eyes before the Lord, no nation on earth or man thereof is worthy of sitting as judge, nay, as a prosecutor, to condemn any other nation. <p> Long after reviews had been published in other journals, there was none in the Geographical Review. What did appear in 1968 was a stiff critique of the book by historian Thomas McGann of the University of Texas. " Unfortunately, " he wrote, " Sauer was not able to avail himself of the long span of research time needed to study the vast and varied culture of the Spanish Main -- the islands and mainland shores of the Caribbean -- that he brought to his work on other areas. " Sauer took exception to the review and ended a long, cordial relationship with the Geographical Review. <p> With Sauer started a new cycle of scholarship on Columbus. By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively on one person 's character, skills, or foibles, the whole of the encounter was fair game. Kirkpatrick Sale, a scholar and essayist, historian and bioregionalist( Parsons 1985 ; Sale 1985), produced in 1990 " The Conquest of Paradise : Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy, " an attractive and readable book that traces a third course of writing on Columbus : a savaging of the large effects of Columbus and the encounter. To Sale, the arrival of Columbus meant not only the introduction of diseases, a pattern of habitual cruelty directed toward the native populations, and constant grappling for wealth ; it also heralded the replacement of a beautiful people by an ugly one. The " noble savage " philosophy is reminiscent of Rousseau, but the argument as constructed by Sale is better than it seems in synopsis. <p> Sale believes in the values of voluntary simplicity and argues that in the New World lay the potential salvation of Europeans. Had they learned instead of raided, they might have escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquisitiveness everywhere they have touched around the world( Sale 1990, 368). <p> And there was salvation there, in the New World, though it was not of a kind the Europeans then understood.... The salvation there, had the Europeans known where and how to look for it, was obviously in the integrative tribal ways, the nurturant communitarian values, the rich interplay with nature that made up the Indian cultures -- as it made up, for that matter, the cultures of ancient peoples everywhere, not excluding Europe.... It was there then, when Colon first encountered what he intuited, correctly, to be " in all the world... no better people nor better country. " <p> The argument is impassioned, and for anyone raised on a diet of utopian fiction, intentional communities, Aldo Leopold 's land ethic, or Edward Abbey 's sarcastic individuality, there is a resonance to Sale 's vision. No doubt something is corrupt about the European conquest of the Americas and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of the critique, even if it is not always possible to agree with the conclusions. Sale 's book is about the conquest of a fancied paradise, not about Columbus, who was simply an agent, not a necessary precondition. Too much of the book is digression and a catalog of wrongs for it to be entirely effective as a conventional history. At best, there are echoes of some of Sauer 's prose, especially in the final chapter( Sale 1990, 370). <p> But all they ever found was half a world of nature 's treasures and nature 's peoples that could be taken, and they took them, never knowing, never learning the true regenerative power there, and that opportunity was lost. Theirs was indeed a conquest of Paradise, but as is inevitable with any war against the world of nature, those who win will have lost -- once again lost, and this time perhaps forever. <p> There is a scriptural and inspirational reverberation in Sale 's prose, yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken personally to heart. That is the first problem. The second is more elemental and more controversial. For Sale, the western hemisphere was a paradise -- pristine, perfect, nature at its finest with inhabitants who were, virtually by definition, in harmony with their world. <p> Were the Americas a virgin paradise, as Sale suggests? Compared with what was left behind in Europe, after centuries of resource exploitation, perhaps yes. But any historical geographer with work ongoing in Latin America would counter with more reservations than reassurances. There is an ever-so-fine line of political plausibility that lies between noting that the pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas included many groups of formidable sophistication, able to alter their environs almost at will, and asserting that native Americans abused their land. More and more geographers, however, are crossing this line and asserting both : the cultures were sophisticated and readily able to manipulate and ruin their surroundings, which they sometimes did, at scales comparable to anything their European successors might match( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural ecology, historians in environmental history, and scholars in anthropology and other disciplines are familiar with such conclusions and find them less than startling. This, though, is the fourth course of Columbian scholarship -- a revision that follows on Sauer 's premises, accepts some of Sale 's pleas for sensitivity to the capabilities of the human and physical environments, and looks history square in the eye to give power where it is due and to make no heroes of hollow figures. <p> Used to working with land as a basic focus of analysis, geographers regularly plumb the reaches of time to make sense of past uses and abuses of the earth 's surface and its inhabitants. When Sauer wrote about the interactions of land and life, he meant exactly that. No part of the human history of the last one thousand years has so distinct a trigger or so broad a pattern of effect as the arrival of Columbus in the Caribbean. What started with that arrival has not stopped and never will. Geographers have every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year. Many have taken a difficult middle ground, not denouncing or deriding, praising or inflating, one contingent or another of Columbian partisanship. Interaction is the real story. No geographer could ask for anything more. <p> In a remarkable scene near the end of " The Sound and the Fury, " by William Faulkner, the simpleton Benjy, whose vision sets the tone of the book, is driven around the back of a statue that he had seen before only from the front. As he sees the unfamiliar backside of the figure, he screams, forlorn and near hysterics, at the impropriety, the shock, the alienness of the sight, a view gone wrong. The legacy of 1492, even for geographers, is somewhat like this scene. Statues and monuments are fine, but they are best seen from all sides. The blessing of the quincentenary is the blossoming of ever more perspectives. If only they continue to flower without, like the century plant, having to wait another hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research was funded in part by a Quincentenary Postdoctoral Fellowship in Spain for American Researchers 1990-1991 from the Spain/United States Joint Committee for Cultural and Educational Cooperation. <p>
