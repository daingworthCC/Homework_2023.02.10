4011941 What are we going to do about contemporary African art? At one level this is a general cocktail-party question ; at another, more immediate one, it sets expectation right in our professional laps. Quite certainly for many the hope is that it might just go away, rather as when a child who knows a monster is lurking in the closet pulls the sheets over his head, on the comforting thesis that what one does n't recognize is n't there. This attitude seemed fairly prevalent at last year 's Triennial Symposium in Washington, D.C. Notwithstanding the noble efforts of Janet Stanley and the indefatigable Jean Kennedy to open the question on their panels, the topic was considered at best marginal, at worst a regrettable intrusion of a tiresome product outside the concerns of serious scholars. But owing to the inherent creativity of African artists, the issue of contemporary art will not go away. <p> Why does the subject appear so resistant, or, equally accurate, why are we so resistant to the subject? One explanation indicates a scholarly desire for purity, the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent modifications that make pronouncements suspect. This is partly the inheritance Africanists acquired from anthropologists who yearn to find that untouched Edenic group Upon such residual authenticity they can base pontification about the eternal primeval nature of people before scholars like themselves arrived to explain the reasons for their behavior. David Brokensha once commented how, in their search for the untouched primitive world, some anthropologists would angle their cameras to block out the background sights of market, school, and church. Never has this mood been better expressed than in a recent cartoon by Gary Larson : a " tribal " family, espying approaching anthropologists through the window of their house, busily set about concealing their telephone, TV, and VCR set. They know what they are expected to display, just as the Maasai know what postures are expected of them, even though on inquiry they will inform the incompetent tourist of the correct lens stops and shutter speeds for the local lighting so that their culture can be properly recorded. <p> We do n't like modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary boundaries -- in fact it challenges them at the profoundest level. It requires us to make intellectual change, as when a professor discovers the disturbing news that, owing to more recent research that he personally has not gotten around to reading but knows about from his students ' bibliographies, he will have to make some amendments to his lecture notes that have lasted so well through recent decades. Certainly it is convenient to be assured that studies can organize all the known elements of a field and that there will not be later intrusions of material that may make nonsense of the most deliberate certainties. That is reason enough to avoid the flux of current artistic production -- at least Leonardo is n't going to paint something more, or, even worse, something different. <p> This attitude seems peculiarly consistent among Africanists. It is not apparently shared by those critics who gain reputation by presenting the latest artists from New York. In fact, among such cognoscenti, novelty is a bonus because it permits almost instantaneous expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic is the monocular pioneer creating simultaneously a career for himself and for the lucky artist his discovery applauds -- sink or swim together in the manner of that high priest Clement Greenberg, forever made memorable by Tom Wolfe in The Painted Word. The artist 's fame becomes the critic 's, to rise or fall depending whether the latter 's words or the former 's messy canvases attract the attention of those who happily relate convinced approval to a solid check. <p> This practice does n't seem to work for the African artist, perhaps because his critics are all but nonexistent Still, that fact does not answer the residual question of why. Surely, if things were nurtured, if the aesthetic garden were mulched and manured, there could be both profit and distinction in the role that has provided fame and fortune in the realm of European and American art. Is ignorance the reason, or are there perhaps sufficient opportunities already sustained by art journals that, unlike African Arts, continuously illustrate contemporary production? <p> Few seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unproductive and, more crucially, unprofitable. What is missing is any conviction that there is any aesthetic basis for justifying a new product to the art community. None of the ready options are satisfactory The spectrum of the contemporary artist ranges from the recognizably African -- in design or subject -- to the decultured international style. These extremes partly match the distinction between locally trained( often self-trained) artists and those who have been educated at a European art school where emulation of the current mode makes for a gratifying reputation. At one end of the spectrum the local art merges with craft( a distinction that in itself owes much to Eurocentric categorizing) ; at the other the African antecedent is all but eliminated as the artist seeks his place in the pantheon of the modernists with all their deliberate contrivance of aberrant and trivial novelty. <p> There is both justification and audience for both extremes, but how can success be measured when outlets scarcely exist? Much as our purists might object, artists do prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa it is still the tourists and local diplomats who control sales. Only a valiant gallery or two, such as Nairobi 's Watatu, and the benevolence of cultural centers like the Goethe Institute provide a consistent opportunity for display. What can constitute a legitimate and logical appraisal of this ever-expanding world of new art from the African continent? To some extent the question is artificial, since it is too rarely aired publicly to occasion speculation and debate. One likes to imagine we have advanced beyond the " amazing it comes from Africa " response. But there is still indifferent dismissal and, on the reverse side, patronizing praise. <p> The art form upon which this debate has most deliberately focused is the work of the Shona carvers in Zimbabwe, whose success owes so much to the intellectual and practical support of Frank McEwen and Tom Blomfield and the dedicated efforts of the galleries of Guthrie, Cook and Karg. Here was a true novelty : carving in stone that seemed to combine the visual inventiveness of pure form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African tradition. Being effectively sponsored by a range of entrepreneurs, mostly honorable, the work did receive appraisal in London. The Daily Telegraph 's opinion was that " of the leading ten sculptor-carvers in the world, perhaps five come from Zimbabwe. " Such is the dismal state of contemporary design, this might mean little more than that the result was better than battered metal incompetently welded that nowadays passes for distinction, but it raises other international standards that only London has persuasively argued.( Of course, the comment has been lovingly repeated in this country in sales brochures that have displayed no work by the famous five, but have offered stone hippos at bargain prices.) No other artists have achieved the standing of a cash evaluation. <p> Perhaps there are glimmers in the darkness. Marshall Mount 's seminal but dated study has been reprinted. Jean Kennedy 's long-promised tome is " in press. " PBS recently aired Carol Blue 's film on Nigerian art. Last year 's " Magicians de la Terre, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, though provocative to the point of exasperation, did show several African artists. It was revealing that they were all carefully selected to be as unlike those from Europe as was possible. " Quaint " and " native " works were preferred to those of the well-respected Senegalese artists working in Paris and perhaps only marginally distinguishable from other experimenters along the Left Bank. " Contemporary African Artists " opened at the Studio Museum in Harlem to fanfare but was not given the attention it deserved. One would have enjoyed more extensive critical critique of the deliberately varied cross-section of the continent that Grace Stanislaus attempted to display with such sympathetic awareness. Perhaps the event will provoke more reactions as it travels across the country to other venues, though as usual it is New York that has to be convinced. Ima Ebong promises that the contemporary art show planned for the Center for African Art in New York will be " a visually stunning and a landmark event. " <p> These events seem to suggest breakthroughs, though I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traditional exports from Africa, or the inflated costs of those which have already emigrated, will force collectors to replace them with contemporary substitutes. There may be a useful void. If only age determines the quality of traditional carvings, and a concept such as " contemporary tradition " is not permitted by those who control aesthetic evaluations and manage to pretend to themselves that they have no responsibility concerning financial evaluations, does this leave a vacancy for the admiration and purchase of " contemporary contemporary "? <p> Future enterprises remain dependent on the incubation of a critical theory that will comprehend the varied efforts of so many able practitioners. This does not mean -- again to refer to The Painted Word -- that scholarship should precede creativity. That most dubious sequence of prior expectation has be disastrous for artistic invention. As a profession we ought to begin to develop some kind of conceptualization of what we expect from Africa and its artists, as the tradition, and the traditional art with which it is associated, disintegrates and adapts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes an African to Paris or London art schools? How do we judge the results? Do we admire his acquisition of international standards -- whatever they are -- or do we admire his resistance to them? Do we regret the lost innocence that reflects neocolonial preference? These lines conclude in medias res, which is a sure sign that no ready resolution is going to be provided from this source. But as the opening words queried, What are we going to do about contemporary African art? If I knew, I would write with fewer question marks that expose my own doubts and anxieties. Lacking any more consequent conclusion, here is comment from another magazine editor. " The success we 've enjoyed demonstrates that we deliver what our readers really want.... In truth today 's magazine readers like ads. " We have reason to believe that. It is certainly far easier to prove than that our readers, and contributors, like contemporary African art. <p> Lena Williams has opened a door into a neglected, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens, it is the living room door. In her article " Bringing the African Legacy into the American Home "( The Living Arts section of the New York Times, April 19,1990), Williams explores the development of the Afrocentric style in the interior design of the African-American home. She defines Afrocentric as a style that celebrates the mixed legacy of the diaspora, incorporating the arts of Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean, and African-Americans. In the Afrocentric style, kente cloth may be hung as art or used as a bedspread, tablecloth, or sofa throw ; a basket from Bolgatanga may grace a mantle or hold a plant ; a chiwara may sit on the glass top of an intricately carved coffee table from Haiti. On the walls, pictures of MLK and Malcolm X are likely to be joined by that of Nelson Mandela. I suppose a billion T.V. viewers are at least subliminally aware of this style from seeing the Cosby-Huxtable home with its " naive " paintings from Senegal and Haiti, and anti-apartheid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must be grandest brownstone in Manhattan. <p> The contemporary roots of Afrocentric are clearly traceable to the black consciousness movement of the ' 60s, when dashikis and Afro hairstyles transformed personal adornment into political gesture. But the Afrocentrism of the ' 90s is likely to be less overtly political and more broadly cultural. By now everyone has read Flash of the Spirit. And even Nancy Reagan used a Bolgatanga basket as a designer piece in one or another of the presidential Berchtesgadens. But for the African Americans interviewed by Williams, Afrocentric is a personal, committed style. Appropriately enough, her article began with a survey of the eighteenth-century Atlanta townhouse of Richard Long, art historian, connoisseur, and founder of the Triennial Symposium on African Art. Referring to his carved coffee table, Long said, " She 's Haitian. " Each of those interviewed used similar personal references. Cheryl Riley, a furniture designer from San Francisco, creates Z-shaped polystyrene " Zulu " chairs that draw upon " the energy and drama that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of her Afrocentric creations in human terms. " They name themselves, " she says of her chairs. One of them calls itself Nefertiti. Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the PBS reporter, pointed to a green and gray marble Shona head on top of her bookcase and said, " This little lady over here is Mbuya Nehanda. She was like the Harriet Tubman of Zimbabwe. I put her up there because she is looking over us. " <p> At first glance, this attitude toward African art seems distant from that of either the scholars or the connoisseurs who we presume read this journal. Afrocentric places value on African art as sign. Concern for masterpieces is eclipsed by more generic interests in evocation and iconic resonance. For African Americans these cultural and social concerns with the arts of Africa and the diaspora are self-explanatory. But what explains the interest of Euro-American professors, cosmopolitan dealers, and readers of African Arts who are likely to grace their own bookcases or nightstands with an ibeji or akuaba? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast-beating manner of Sally Price or Marianna Torgovnick, whose recent monographs( Primitive Art in Public Places, Gone Primitive) proclaim their authors ' path-breaking discovery of unconscious motivations in the Euro-American( but not African or Oceanic) mind. And their revelation that the Euro-American mind objectifies the Other, and sees in it only the qualities it desires or fears. So what else is new? Freud 's been dead for fifty-one years. Sure, people read their nightmares and ecstasies into other peoples ' cultures. And they probably make private reads of their own cultures too.( What, one wonders, do Price or Torgovnick make of Roy Orbison, Roseanne Barr, the Remington bronzes, or Keane paintings?) <p> Given that all cultural interests beyond the most trivial are rooted in the unconscious, I wonder what the current boom in African art in non-African-American home decoration signifies? What are the semiotics of such displays? It was easy enough in the old days( i.e., before 1970 or ' 75) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively cheap way to build an impressive collection. Roger Fry satisfied his acute but impoverished aesthetic longings in this way. And Levi-Strauss has admitted that one of the charms of living in New York in the 1940s was the ready availability of North American Indian art masterpieces in the offbeat shops and galleries of Manhattan. Those days of gaining a chance masterpiece on the cheap are gone, as the interesting research of Jules-Rosette and Steiner( inter altos) has made clear. So too is the thrill of the unknown. Whatever Picasso may or may not have learned from the African masks at the Trocadero, the MOMA show surely put the historical cap on " primitivism " as an inspiration for Western art. <p> I suspect it is another artistic impulse that explains the current vogue for African art as decor, the impulse James Clifford calls Ethnographic Surrealism. In the time between the Wars, French scholars, intellectuals, and flaneurs drawn to surrealism roamed the Parisian flea markets for African objets d'art. Not for their inherent excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ineffable Other. They were seeking strangeness. The delights of cultural impurity and disturbing syncretisms. Pieces of African art became objets trouves in a new aesthetic that defined beauty as " the chance encounter on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella "( Lautreamont). Or, mutatis mutandis, the chance encounter of Dogon granary ladders and to guna( carved posts from men 's lodges) with kigango commemorative sculpture from the Gohu of southeast Kenya and the decidedly Rothkoesque paintings of Ryu Okabayashi. <p> That last curious assemblage constituted " The Canon of Verticality " show( June 1990) at the Ernie Wolfe Gallery in West L.A. The gallery itself is located around the corner from the Nuart, a retro movie house with a superb neon sign( where I saw Yeelen a couple of years ago), and down from Gianfranco 's, a trattoria that looks and tastes as though it were lifted from the Trastevere. The Wolfe Gallery, then, and his adjacent Turkana Gallery, function as elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first gallery visit a few months earlier, when Ernie hosted a reception for the UCLA opening of " Art/Artifact. " That Center for African Art exhibit limited itself to a comparative history of public representations, leaving the social dimensions of exported African art to observant guests at the gallery The anteroom of the Turkana was filled with garish papier-mache heads from Guinea Bissau -- leering deformity masks perched at angles in front of monitors playing videos of last year 's Carnival. One wondered what sort of living room could accommodate these huge random objects. <p> The inside room of the gallery offered clues. A collection of tables was surrounded by African twig chairs decorated with the elan of an Onitsha sign painter. Red chairs with white polka dots. Turquoise chairs with leopard-print seat pads. And on the table, animal-print napkins a la the Nairobi tourist market were set by Franciscan dinner plates. Pre-Victorian alabaster plant holders said to have stood outside a Raja 's palace now stood by the tables as wine buckets. Over this crazed picnic scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet gopher snake, Mr. Snake. And on the walls hung the sign paintings of Nairobi artist Joseph Bertiers, whose best work resembles that of Cheri Samba, and whose worst, that of Onisco, a commercial artist I knew in Samaru who specialized in plywood portraits of Bruce Lee. Bertiers has a special fixation with the odd pastime of painting live cats. Several signs warned against such cruelty while aquamarine felines in agony raced across the painted scenes. Ernie was planning to present Bertiers ' work more formally at a chili feed on Good Friday. Lautreamont would, I think, have been intrigued. <p> I am probably stacking the deck by discussing the social use of African art in a city as unreal as Los Angeles. But then, the country has been duly warned that what L.A. is, the rest of it will become. African art enters the vocabulary of the postmodern, or whatever it is you wish to call this age when the strange is next door and the familiar at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too is Afrosurreal. A celebration of Africa as a vibrant counter in world culture. Decontextualized certainly( the way that the West is decontextualized in Africa), but made part of an emerging composite in which Los Angeles, New York, Lagos, Kinshasa, and Nairobi are all part of a funky continuum. As David Byrne sings in his cumbia " Independence Day " : <p> The compass points in two directions And North and South are both the same We 'll look forward to the good fumes Come our Independence Day... <p> This is one hell of an optimistic assessment, which naively, I suppose, does not pay attention to who 's getting paid and who 's not. But somehow Bertiers ' signs hanging at the Turkana are related to King Sunny Ade playing at the Hollywood Palladium and Nelson Mandela speaking to 100,000 intense admirers at the L.A. Coliseum. After such a long, tough decade here and in Africa, these intrusions are reasons to celebrate. <p> By John F. Povey and Donald J. Cosentino @
