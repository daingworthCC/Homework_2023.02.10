4000341 The high point of my freshman-year English literature survey course, taught by that sweet man and Emily Dickinson biographer Richard Sewall, came early in the fall. Struggling through the Middle English of The Canterbury Tales, I arrived at the point in the story where the narrator of the poem -- referred to by critics as " Chaucer the pilgrim " -- becomes a character in it. At the conclusion of " The Prioress 's Tale, " the host notices " me " for the first time and asks, " What man artou?... Thou lookest as thou woldest find an hare, / For evere upon the ground I see thee stare. " He asks Chaucer to contribute " a tale of mirth. " The narrator replies that he knows only " a rym I lerned longe agoon. " This turns out to be " The Tale of Sir Thopas, " a turgid bit of doggerel about an ineffectual and effeminate knight. It goes on for a couple of dozen stanzas, and then, in the middle of a line, the host breaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddes dignitee!... By God, ' quod he, ' for plainly, at oo one word, / Thy drasty rubbishy rhyming is not worth a tord. ' " <p> I found this thrilling, for reasons that were n't immediately clear. Turning to E. T. Donaldson 's commentary in the back of my Chaucer book, I read, " The relation between the creator and the created that the situation implies is revealed by a mind almost godlike in the breadth and vision of its ironic vision. " That was helpful. It led me to understand, in due time, that I responded powerfully in estimable works of art to moments when the artist... winks : acknowledges, implicitly or explicitly, that what we are experiencing is after all a piece of human handiwork and he or she is the creator of it. It is a gesture simultaneously of humility and of majesty, in both cases honoring the potency of art. <p> The next year, in a seminar on Romantic poetry, my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keats 's " Ode to a Nightingale " when he muses that the nightingale 's song has " Charm 'd magic casements, opening on the foam / Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. " The stanza ends, and the new one starts with, " Forlorn! the very word is like a bell / To toll me back from thee to my sole self! " The echoing of the word forlorn, the professor claimed( arguably but provocatively), was the first moment in the history of English verse that a poem took itself as its subject. In the final lecture of a Shakespeare survey, I got goose bumps when Alvin Kernan, another terrific teacher, recited the speech in which Prospero tells the audience that " The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, / And like this insubstantial pageant faded / Leave not a rack behind. " The " great globe, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the play was being performed. Moreover, Prospero 's forsaking his magic was implicitly compared to Shakespeare himself giving up the magic of playwriting, The Tempest being his final work. And moreover( not to put too fine a point on it), this was Kernan 's final lecture, before leaving teaching for administrative work, so we understood that he, too, was implicitly saying he was giving up his magic. Great stuff. <p> All this happened in the 1970s, when postmodernism was barely a concept. Now it 's a frayed cultural clich. The self-reference I responded to in Chaucer and Shakespeare long ago acquired an academic moniker -- " reflexivity. " A related phenomenon, works referring to other works, was dubbed " intertextuality. " Together they are subsumed under the ubiquitous term " meta, " at one time a useful prefix for self-conscious endeavors, now an annoying, nearly all-purpose adjective.( " The Matrix is very meta. ") Practice has, if anything, outstripped theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedians playing themselves, movies( like Adaptation) about the process of making a movie, buildings or paintings or poems or novels that refer to themselves as buildings or paintings or poems or novels : we have all, probably, had enough of them. <p> But I still respond to -- indeed, delight in -- reflexivity and intertextuality in one art form. That would be popular music. Flipping the radio dial, I get chills when I come on James Taylor 's " That 's Why I 'm Here "( " Fortune and fame 's such a curious game / Perfect strangers can call you by name / Pay good money to hear ' Fire and Rain ' / Again and again and again "), or the Beatles ' " Glass Onion "( " I told you ' bout Strawberry Fields, / You know the place where nothing is real "), Pink 's " Do n't Let Me Get Me "( " Tired of being compared to / Damn Britney Spears / She 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even Eminem 's " White America "( " Let 's do the math. / If I was black, I would 've sold half "). And I actually grin when a country station plays a recent hit by Alan Jackson that 's about, and is, a " Three Minute Positive Not Too Country Uptempo Love Song. " For years -- decades -- I have been collecting these songs, just as bird-watchers do with their sightings, separating my life list into categories and subcategories, and ranking all entries according to originality, profundity, and ultimate value. <p> I will share my system with you in a minute, as soon as I try to rebut the charge that self-reference in pop music does not escape the curses of preciousness, self-regard, clich, and portentousness it is subject to elsewhere. A clue to its avoidance strategy is the word itself : the music -- the melody, the singing, the instrumentation, the beat -- takes attention and a portion of the burden from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about popular music. The words to a song may lie leaden on the page in a CD booklet or an ill-conceived Collected Lyrics, but, through a strange alchemy, reverberate like poetry when they are accompanied by melody. In the same way, the music can remove the self-importance from a level of reflexivity that, drunk neat, would be deadly. <p> American popular song lyrics have always had a wide self-conscious streak. Possibly the most successful popular song of all time was Irving Berlin 's 1911 " Alexander 's Ragtime Band, " a song about music. Ira Gershwin 's first lyrics to be sung in public, in 1918, were to " The Real American Folk Song Is a Rag " ; a later effort was " What Can You Say in a Love Song( That Has n't Been Said Before)? " from the musical comedy " Life Begins at 8:40, " beginning " Darling, here 's that song you inspired / In a style I acquired / Living with songs of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alley, the mythical locus of the popular songwriting industry, continually nudged one another in the ribs with reminders of what it was they were doing. The Alley was a closed cosmos, with songs commenting on predecessors and begetting successors : first, " Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland, " then " When I Met You Tonight in Dreamland " and " Dreamland Brings Memories of You. " <p> The great American songwriters, all of whom either started on Tin Pan Alley or were begotten by it, liked to tip their hats to one another. In " They Ca n't Take That Away from Me, " Gershwin name-checks one of Irving Berlin 's classics : " The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote / ' The Melody Lingers On. ' " Berlin, who normally looked straight ahead in his lyrics, permitted himself, " Tuneful, tasteful, soulful, smart. / Music : Rodgers. Lyrics : Hart. " In " You 're the Top, " Cole Porter paired " Waldorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gifted humans like Vincent Youmans, " surely one of the all-time great rhymes. It was Porter who took this sort of thing beyond intramural bantering to high wit. He wrote the immortal couplet " But how strange / The change from major to minor, " which is sung just as the key of the song( " Every Time We Say Goodbye ") changes from major to minor. " It 's De-Lovely, " from the musical " Anything Goes, " begins, " I feel a sudden urge to sing / The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. / So control your desire to curse / While I crucify the verse. / This verse I 've started seems to me / The ' Tin-Pan-tithesis ' of melody. / So to spare you all the pain, / I 'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain. " Tin-Pan-tithesis : the formulation deserves a moment of silence. <p> Hoagy Carmichael 's " Stardust, " which some authorities consider the greatest American song, is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " haunts my reverie... Now my consolation / Is in the stardust of a song. " Is the song " Stardust "? It 's a mystery, but a sweet one. <p> Tin Pan Alley was zoned out of existence a long time ago. But today 's generically striated pop universe -- country, hip-hop, rock, and so forth, each with its own further gradations -- is just as self-referential. In fact, it 's more so, and in order to assess the field adequately I 'll need to break it into two groups, the reflexive and the intertextual, each with a meta offshoot. <p> The first category consists of songs that refer to or are about themselves, in the manner of " Ode to a Nightingale " and " It 's De-Lovely. " And so : Elton John 's " Your Song " ; James Taylor 's " Hey Mister, That 's Me Up On the Jukebox "( " I 'm the one who 's singing this sad song ") ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song By Heart " ; George Harrison 's " This Song "( the two-word phrase occurs in most of these entries) ; Simon and Garfunkel 's " Song for the Asking " ; Carly Simon 's " You 're So Vain "( " You probably think this song is about you ") ; The Doors ' " Hello, I Love You "( " When she moves, my brain sings out this song ") ; Jim Croce 's " I 'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song " ; Public Enemy 's " Bring the Noise "( " Radio stations I question their blackness / They call themselves black, / But we 'll see if they play this ") ; Three Dog Night 's " Old-Fashioned Love Song " ; Spandau Ballet 's " True "( " Why do I find it hard to write the next line? ") ; Steely Dan 's " Deacon Blues "( " I cried when I wrote this song / Sue me if I play too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broke My Promise "( " That I would n't write another song about you. / I guess I lied ") ; the Beatles ' " Only a Northern Song "( " If you 're listening to this song / You may think the chords are going wrong ") and " Michelle "( " These are words that go together well "). <p> One thing should be immediately apparent from the list : reflexiveness can be associated with both good and bad songs. You do n't have to be familiar with every title to grasp that, merely with the two biggest chartbusters, by Elton John and Three Dog Night. " Old-Fashioned Love Song " is a bland and genial ditty, saved -- barely -- from complete negligibility by its self-reference. Bernie Taupin 's lyrics to " Your Song, " swept along by John 's potent melody, are, like many lyric poems, convincingly about the challenges of doing justice in words to the loved one 's qualities. Toward the end, they double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is like a bell " fashion, the singer admitting, haltingly, " You see I 've forgotten if they 're green or they 're blue. / Anyway the thing is, what I really mean, / Yours are the sweetest eyes I 've ever seen. " <p> There 's nothing special or mysterious about what makes good self-conscious songs good -- just adequate artistry, originality, wit, and feeling. The last is especially important, but the other qualities can go a long way as well. The rapper Nas does some dazzlingly reflexive sleight of hand, in the braggadocious mode hip-hop has claimed for its own, when he raps, " They shootin! / Aw, made you look. / You a slave to a page in my rhyme book. " <p> In this subgenre, the song about itself, one trope has inspired some particularly ingenious lyric writing : imagining the effect the song will have on listeners when it comes out of the radio or, especially in country music, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reminiscent of the Aeolian Harp or Lyre, a common image in Romantic poetry : the winds of the world would blow through it and make haunting melodies.) The country singer David Allan Coe has a number called " I 'm Going to Hurt Her on the Radio, " and Buck Owens 's 1979 song " Play ' Together Again ' Again " asks a bystander to put in a quarter and punch the numbers of an earlier Owens hit. Bruce Springsteen 's moving " Bobby Jean, " addressed to a friend or lover who 's unexpectedly taken a powder, conjectures : " Maybe you 'll be out there on that road / Somewhere in some bus or train / Traveling along in some motel room / There 'll be a radio playing and you 'll hear me sing this song. / Well, if you do, you 'll know I 'm thinking of you. " <p> Loudon Wainwright III 's mordant " Pretty Good Day " is a catalogue of small victories. The singer wakes up and finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets without hearing any sirens or getting shot or even seeing any snipers, and when he gets home, he says, " Nobody was frightened, wounded, hungry, or cold. " The final stanza is unanticipatedly cathartic : " I slept through the night, got through to the dawn / I flipped the switch and the light went on. / I wrote down my dream, I wrote this song. " Those last four words turn the closing refrain -- " It 's a pretty good day so far " -- from ironic self-protection to a welcome truth. <p> None of the lyrical maneuvers or tropes I 've described above should be unfamiliar to past or present English majors, who would do well to equip their computers with a global key that produces the phrase, " Just as in the poem... " Indeed, it is accepted wisdom that reflexivity is an, if not the, obsession of modern poetry. You find it explicitly in, for example, Archibald MacLeish 's " Ars Poetica " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "), and implicitly pretty much wherever you look -- in Pound, Eliot, Stevens. But there 's an advanced class of pop-music reflexivity that is little seen in these poets, although, come to think of it, it 's everywhere in Whitman, who even gave it a name : " Song of Myself. " In popular music, this is a post-Beatles phenomenon. In the pre-rock era, a popular singer -- think Frank Sinatra -- was manifestly an actor, convincingly giving voice to the playwright 's( songwriter 's) words and music. One of the few figures who combined singing and songwriting( as well as a capacious ego) was George M. Cohan, and his work was full of explicitly autobiographical representations, most famously in " The Yankee Doodle Boy. " <p> Now singers and bands are expected to have composed their own material, and the Cohan stance is standard. Most blatantly, there is the song about the singer or singers : sometimes merely saying his, her, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrating. For some reason, the one that always comes to mind is the Monkees ' theme song, the one that starts, " Hey, hey, we 're the Monkees. "( Surely Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were paying homage to those boys in " The Message " when they rapped, " Hey, we 're Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. " A later rap ensemble kicked it up a notch and were n't paying homage to anybody in a song piquantly titled, " Wu-Tang Clan Ai n't Nuthing to **** Wit "). But there are many others. The late-seventies band Devo memorably chanted, " Are we not men? / We are Devo! " The Mamas and the Papas ' " Creeque Alley " is a musical memoir in the form of a shaggy-dog story : " John and Mitchy were getting kind of itchy / Just to leave the folk music behind / Zol and Denny workin ' for a penny / Tryin ' to get a fish on the line. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang " The Ballad of John and Yoko, " just as Mott the Hoople sang " The Ballad of Mott the Hoople. " Grand Funk Railroad protested too much in " We 're an American Band, " and Jennifer Lopez recently used autobiography as spin control when she tried to convince her longtime fans that despite all the magazine covers and bling-bling, she was still " Jenny from the Block. " John Eddie has a painfully funny recent song about a special circle of hell for the singer-songwriter : the bar where a drunk loudly asks, " Who the Hell is John Eddie? "( The title of the song is the heckler 's command -- " Play Some Skynyrd. ") The blustery " I Write the Songs " indulged in enough egotism to taint both the author( Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys) and the bellower of the highest-charting version( Barry Manilow). Moving from the ridiculous to the sublime : It is n't surprising that thoughtful singer-songwriters like Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Merle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about music 's significance to them, in, respectively, " From Hank to Hendrix, " " For Free, " " After I Sing My Songs, " and " Old. " <p> A subtler, off-center kind of introspection can be found in the alter-ego song or group of songs, presented in the voice of a performer who has something but not everything in common with the actual one : the Beatles ' " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band, " Dire Straits ' " Sultans of Swing, " Eminem 's Slim Shady, David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust, Billy Joel 's " Piano Man. " Glen Campbell has bookended his career with two such songs( neither of which he wrote) : the 1975 " Rhinestone Cowboy, " in which an unknown dreams of " getting cards and letters from people I do n't even know, " and the more recent " Mansion in Bronson, " in which the record company tells an aging country star, " You 're too out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small masterpiece in the subgenre is Randy Newman 's " Lonely at the Top, " whose singer, evidently a show-biz icon, boasts, " I 've been around the world / Had my pick of any girl. " Newman wrote this when he was a struggling songwriter and performer with no albums to his credit. <p> I actually prefer autobiographical moments to autobiographical songs. In " You Got ta Serve Somebody, " Dylan( n Robert Zimmerman), normally unforthcoming to the point of invisibility, shockingly proclaims, " You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy. " In " Tenth Avenue Freezeout, " Springsteen recalls " When they made that change uptown and the Big Man joined the band. " The Big Man : saxophonist and crowd favorite Clarence Clemons ; in concert, the line always gets a roar. James Taylor 's " Fire and Rain " talks about " Sweet dreams and flying machines. " Flying Machine : Taylor 's first band. A great moment in the Supremes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer Diana Ross interrupts her romantic lament to wonder, " How can Mary tell me what to do / When she lost her love so true? / And Flo, she do n't know / Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo. " Mary and Flo : fellow Supremes Mary Wilson and Florence Birdsong. One puzzling but cool thing about the aside is that it( like the rest of the song) was n't written by Ross but by Motown staff composers Holland-Dozier-Holland. In " Showbiz Kids, " Steely Dan throws in an unexpected self-reference in the manner of a Hitchcock cameo or a postage-stamp portrait-of-the-artist in a vast landscape : " They got the Steely Dan T-shirts. " <p> When it comes to singing about yourself, the hands-down champions are two musical forms that are rarely, if ever, associated with each other : country and hip-hop. They show up disproportionately in all these categories, in fact ; one reason is that they still prize the Tin Pan Alley values of word-play and wit. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral tradition, rap is partial to boasts about the rapper 's prowess in rhyming, loving, fighting, etc. Thus Run-DMC raps, " I 'm the king of rock, there ai n't none higher / Sucker MCs should call me sire. " In another number, Run-DMC gives its deejay, Jam Master Jay( since deceased), his props : " J-A-Y are the letters of his name / Cuttin ' and scratchin ' are the aspects of his game, / So check out the Master as he cuts these jams / And look at us with the mikes in our hands. " <p> Early country performers tended to sing their hymns of love, memory, and heartbreak through generic personae, although Jimmie Rodgers had a song about himself called " Jimmie the Kid " and Ernest Tubb one called " When I First Began to Sing, " which cited Rodgers as an influence. The greatest country singer was Hank Williams. The power of his lyrics lay in their seemingly complete emotional sincerity ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1953, he was on the charts with a song called " I 'll Never Get Out of This World Alive. " But he made few, if any, direct references to himself -- ironic, considering how obsessively he has been invoked by others. Modern country autobiography began in 1971, when Johnny Cash recorded " The Man in Black, " which explained his wardrobe( " I wear it for the thousands who have died, / Believin ' that the Lord was on their side, " among other reasons), and Loretta Lynn recorded " Coal Miner 's Daughter, " which told the story of Loretta Lynn 's life. Both songs gave their creators indelible nicknames -- and nicknames are very, very big in country. <p> The floodgates opened with the " outlaw country " movement a couple of years later, which took as its text Kitty Wells 's old number " The Life They Live in Songs. " Willie " Red-Headed Stranger " Nelson and Waylon " Hoss " Jennings, in particular, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Nelson spun picaresque yarns like " On the Road Again, " " Me and Paul, " and " Devil in a Sleeping Bag " and angrily told greedy record-company executives to " Write Your Own Songs " ; Jennings asked rhetorically, " Do n't You Think This Outlaw Bit 's Done Got Out of Hand? " and " Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way? " <p> The laureate of country memoir is Hank Williams Jr., also known as Bocephus, who was just three years old when his father died. As a child, he went on the road singing Hank Williams songs, in an uncanny imitation of Hank Williams 's voice. The experience was unenviable, but it provided young Bocephus with a great theme. In 1966, when Hank Jr. was seventeen, he wrote and recorded " Standing in the Shadows " : " I know I 'm not great, and some say I imitate.... It 's hard when you 're standing in the shadows of a very famous man. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and in the late 1970s and early ' 80s issued a series of compelling songs -- including " The Conversation, " " Living Proof, " and " Whisky Bent and Hellbound " -- about trying to live up to his father 's musical standards and at the time escape the legacy of a self-destructive life and early death. His masterpiece, I would say, is " Family Tradition, " where the refrain alternates between a lament and a sort of rueful and rollicking celebration : " Lord, I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam / And they both tried to kill me in 1973. / When that doctor asked me, / ' Son how did you get in this condition? ' / I said, ' Hey sawbones, I 'm just carrying on / An ole family tradition. ' " <p> The autobiographical expectation in country has become sufficiently entrenched as to spawn ghostwriters. That is, everyone in Nashville knows that George " Possum " Jones does n't write his own songs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he is expected to sing about himself. Therefore, other writers regularly supply him with numbers that allow him to poke fun at his own image, like " I Do n't Need Your Rocking Chair " and "( They Call Me) No-Show Jones. " I have no problem with that, but the self-mythologizing of minor figures, like David Allen Coe in " Waylon, Willie, and Me, " can get wearing. <p> " Waylon, Willie, and Me " : The song is also an example of the second broad category, musical intertextuality, where the references are to other compositions and performers. Unavoidable examples are Don McLean 's " American Pie " and Rick Nelson 's " Garden Party, " rather self-satisfied allegories that all but demand crib sheets to parse the references.( In " American Pie, " " the King " is Elvis and " the Jester " is Dylan -- but who 's " the Queen "?) By contrast, a single well-placed musical allusion can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : see Mary Chapin Carpenter 's " there ai n't no cure for my blues today / Except when the paper says Beausoleil is coming to town " ; Springsteen 's " Roy Orbison sang for the lonely " ; Stephen Bishop 's " put on Sinatra and start to cry " ; Nirvana 's " Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld / So I can sigh eternally " ; Steely Dan 's " Hey Nineteen "( " that 's ' Retha Franklin / She do n't remember the Queen of Soul ") ; Calexico 's song " Not Even Stevie Nicks " ; the Police 's line " An Otis Redding record, it 's all I own, " and Davis Daniel 's " She went to William and Mary, / I went to Haggard and Jones. " <p> Earlier, I mentioned some early Tin Pan Alley " response " songs, and that continuing tradition definitely supplies an intertextual frisson. In 1954, an R &; B singer named Hank Ballard put out a suggestive record, full of double entendres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so successful that it crossed over to the pop charts, and Ballard and his band, the Midnighters, followed it up with " Annie Had a Baby( Ca n't Work No More), " " Annie 's Aunt Fannie, " and " Henry 's Got Flat Feet( Ca n't Dance No More). " Others got into the act as well, most notably Etta James, in " Roll with Me, Henry. "( A white singer, Georgia Gibbs, released a sanitized version, " Dance with Me, Henry. ") That kind of call-and-response is a sign of vitality and attentiveness in the art form. <p> It can be even more invigorating when song number two begs to differ with song number one. Hank Thompson 's reflexive 1951 " The Wild Side of Life " starts with the lament that since the singer 's wife has abandoned him, he must give her his message " in the words of this song. " And the message is, " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the places where the wine and liquor flows. " Kitty Wells 's response came swiftly, and constituted a rousing pre-feminism feminist statement : " As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing / That old song about the wild, wild side of life. / As I listen to the words you are saying, / It brings memories when I was a trusting wife. / It was n't God who made honky-tonk angels / As you say in the words of your song. " UTFO 's early rap song " Roxanne, Roxanne " inspired some twenty-five responses, including two by singers who adopted the name of the girl in the song and told her side of the story : Roxanne Shante and the Real Roxanne. Merle Haggard 's " Okie from Muskogee " spawned Big Brother and the Holding Company 's " I 'll Fix Your Flat Tire, Merle " and " Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother, " written by Ray Wylie Hubbard and performed by Jerry Jeff Walker. And who can forget Lynyrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope Neil Young will remember / Southern man do n't need him around anyhow "? <p> As this suggests, response songs can move beyond disagreement to assault and battery. In a sour mood, John Lennon asked Paul McCartney, " How Do You Sleep? "( " The freaks was right when they said you was dead. ") Richard Thompson 's " I Agree with Pat Metheny " refers to Metheny 's outburst against saxophonist Kenny G 's digitized " duet " with Louis Armstrong : " A meeting of the minds, how nice / Like Einstein and Sporty Spice. " Joan Baez got Dylan -- " the unwashed phenomenon, the original vagabond " -- inmost famously in " Diamonds and Rust, " but stuck the knife in a little deeper in " Oh Brother, " which begins " You 've got eyes like Jesus / But you speak with a viper 's tongue. " They Might Be Giants ' catty " Rhythm Section Want Ad " asks " Do you sing like Olive Oyl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " John Hiatt 's " Memphis in the Morning, " a rare anti-country-music song, correctly observes, " I do n't think Ronnie Milsap 's ever going to record this song. " <p> The genre that thrives on insults -- also known as " beefs " -- is, of course, rap, where it 's understood that the more derisively a performer can put down a competitor, the more decisively he can elevate himself. The still-unsolved murders of the feuding Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. several years ago put a bit of a damper on all-out beefing, but it has returned in a stylized and presumably stage-managed form, reminiscent of show-business rows like the one between Jack Benny and Fred Allen. So, Nelly on KRS-One : " You the first old man should get a rapper 's pension / No hits since the cordless mic invention. " Nas 's " Ether " asked Jay-Z, " How much of Biggie 's rhymes is gon na come out your fat lips? " ; Jay-Z responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair with the mother of Nas 's daughter. Eazy-E took on a major hip-hop figure with " All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a g-thing / But on his old album covers, he was a she-thing. "( " G " is short for gangsta.) Not exactly Oscar Wilde, but it works for me. <p> Country music, by contrast, favors an intertextuality of admiration, most visibly in the tribute song. To be sure, country has no monopoly on this sometimes moving, sometimes schmaltzy, sometimes crass genre. Ronnie McDowell recorded " The King Is Gone " the day after Elvis Presley 's death, and it 's been followed by 202 more Elvis tributes, according to New York deejay Peter Bochan, who lists them on his Web site( http : **32;1014;TOOLONG). If there 's a " Rock and Roll Heaven, " the Righteous Brothers memorably noted, " you know they 've got a hell of a band. " George Harrison sang about John Lennon in " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialized George in " Never Without You. " The Commodores ' " Night Shift " honors the estimable lineup of fallen soul singers, and Tupac Shakur has been mourned in Master P 's " Is There a Heaven 4 a Gangsta?, " Richie Rich 's " Do G 's Go to Heaven?, " and Naughty By Nature 's " Mourn Till I Join Ya, " which avers, " Nigga I miss ya this thug gon na miss ya till I 'm witcha. " <p> But this is as nothing compared with country tribute songs. The tradition started in 1933, with the death of the Singing Brakeman, Jimmie Rodgers, at the age of thirty-five. Just days later, " When Jimmie Rodgers Said Goodbye " was issued, followed by " The Train Carrying Jimmie Rodgers Home, " " The Life of Jimmie Rodgers, " " The Passing of Jimmie Rodgers, " and many others. Hank Williams 's death twenty years later, at the age of twenty-nine, was followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metress, sixteen songs honoring Williams were released in 1953 alone, and there has been no sign of a letup. A German devotee of American country music lists ninety-six Williams tribute songs on his Web site( http : //www.haukestruebing.com), including " Hank Williams Meets Jimmie Rodgers, " " Hank Williams Sings the Blues No More, " " Please Do n't Let the Name ' Hank ' Die, " " Everybody Wants to Be Hank Williams, " Jerry Jeff Walker 's " I Feel Like Hank Williams Tonight, " and Johnny Cash 's " The Night Hank Williams Came to Town. " <p> Country songwriters love tribute songs so much that they even write them to singers who are still alive, as in David Allan Coe 's " Hank Williams Jr, " ; Toby Keith 's " I 'll Never Smoke Weed with Willie Again " ; Tim McGraw 's " Give It to Me Strait " ; Chris Wall 's " An Outlaw 's Blues, " about Waylon Jennings ; Becky Hollis 's " Jones on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Why I Sing This Way "( the reason, he explains, is " Mama used to whip me with a George Jones album "). Before his death in September 2003, Johnny Cash was the subject of "( In the Mood for) Johnny Cash, " " Hooked on Johnny Cash, " " Walking Talking Johnny Cash Blues, " Billy Joe Shaver 's " That 's Why the Man in Black Sings the Blues, " and his own daughter Roseanne 's lovely " My Old Man. " <p> If you sing a song of a certain kind, if your parents sang that song, and if you expect that your children will sing it as well, then you 're not likely to attempt to characterize, explain, or defend it in a song. But sometimes a musical genre is more contentious. Listeners and performers think about and define themselves by it. That the blues is a highly self-conscious genre can be grasped merely from the fact that roughly half of blues songs contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and roll were lyrically proclaimed seemingly from the moment of its birth, the constant invocation of " rock " and " rock and roll " being only partly explained by the terms ' sexual innuendo. Bill Haley and the Comets asked us to " Rock Around the Clock " ; Chuck Berry wrote a song( covered by the Beatles) called, simply, " Rock and Roll Music " and in another commanded, " Hail, hail rock and roll " ; Danny and the Juniors proclaimed " Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay. " Meanwhile, rearguard singers vocally demurred, as Nat King Cole in " Mr. Cole Wo n't Rock and Roll, " which regretfully observed, " When Tin Pan Alley serenades a beauty / Do they sing of Rose Marie or Sweet Lorraine? / No, they dedicate a hymn to Tutti Frutti, / Who 's as tender as a dame from Mickey Spillane. " The Byrds ' " So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star " was a biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 " It 's Only Rock and Roll( But I Like It) " was appropriate, since the battle had long been won, although heavy-metal anthems of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s, such as AC/DC 's " Let There Be Rock, " protested excessively in invoking rock( never rock and roll) as a near-holy pursuit. And, needless to say, there will never be an end to boring songs about life on the road. <p> When it comes to meta-music, yet again, country is king. There is a curious history here. As Richard A. Peterson explains in his 1997 book Creating Country Music, the word country itself was an invention of the early 1950s. The music had been called, variously, " western, " " hillbilly, " and " folk " ; to consolidate the terms and, Peterson shows, to avoid the left-wing associations with the last( Pete Seeger and Paul Robeson performed folk music, after all), the Nashville powers that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent success, largely, I would say, because it brilliantly combined a declaration of the rural origin of the music with a subliminal patriotic assertion : that the music was of, about, and for this country. <p> Whatever the reasons, the country song about country music has become legion. A partial, alphabetical list, including only ones that put the magic word in the title : <p> " Back When Country Was Ugly " ; " Country Enough " ; " Country In My Genes " ; " Country Music Is Here to Stay " ; " Country My Ass " ; " Country Till I Die " ; " Country Was the Song " ; " A Damn Good Country Song " ; " Do n't Think You 're Too Good for Country Music " ; " Every Kind of Music But Country " ; " A Few Old Country Boys " ; " Gone Country " ; " Heart of a Country Song " ; " Here 's to Country Music " ; " Hit Country Song " ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If That Ai n't Country " ; " If There Was No Country Music " ; " I 'm Country " ; " I 'm That Country " ; " A Jukebox with a Country Song " ; " Kindly Keep It Country " ; " My Life Would Make a Damn Good Country Song " ; " Now That 's Country " ; " The Perfect Country Song " ; " Put Some Drive In Your Country " ; " A Sad Country Song " ; " Take Me Back to the Country " ; " Too Country " ; " Too Rock for Country " ; " Welcome to the Country Music Hall of Fame " ; and " You 're Looking at Country. " <p> There are three broad historical categories. The first were self-congratulatory : songs about how wonderful Jimmie, Hank, and Lefty were ; how the singer is following in their path ; how there 's nothing like a country song to express joy or heartbreak. The second, more contentious and dating from the 1970s, recognized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " country music. " Southern rock bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers had claimed a kinship with country, to the dismay of some venerable Nashville personages, and the outlaws -- Hoss, Willie, Bocephus, the Man in Black, and Kris Kristofferson -- countered with pleas for a more inclusive definition. One of Hank Jr. ' s several entries in this category, " Why Do n't You Leave Them Boys Alone? "( cowritten with Tanya Tucker), was noteworthy because he was joined on it not only by Waylon Jennings but also by one of the old guard, Ernest Tubb. <p> The third, still-current type is a lament, summed up in the lyrics of the Dixie Chicks ' recent hit " Long Time Gone " : " the music ai n't got no soul / Now they sound tired but they do n't sound Haggard / They 've got money but they do n't have Cash. / They got Junior but they do n't have Hank. " Or, in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Country. " The villains of these pieces are n't rock bands but the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus, Garth Brooks, Faith Hill, and Shania Twain : the cowboy-hatted, midriff-baring Barbie and Ken dolls whose bland and innocuous sounds push real country artists off the so-called country stations. Performers like Tritt, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, and Marty Stuart include at least one such critique on every CD they release. Stuart is the most self-consciously militant of this group. His most recent recording is called Country Music, which is a little like Jonathan Franzen putting out a novel called Contemporary Fiction. <p> Have I justified my obsession? If not, it 's probably too late to defend it. But I will say that as fatuous, lame, inauthentic, and cheesy as popular music often is, it manages to retain a gravity not often found in other arts, low or high. The way people respond to an action movie, a prime-time soap opera, or a romance novel can be fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other article of bad faith. Music 's logic is at its base emotional and thus not as easily assailed. More elevated works -- say, an off-off-Broadway play in which the actors start commenting on the previous scene, or a contemporary painting that, in its use of color or texture, is " about " painting -- have a contrary problem : they are trees falling in, if not a forest, then a very sparsely populated region. In pop music, good or bad, there is usually the sense that something is at stake. As a result, it demands our attention. Bob Dylan is no Shakespeare, but, like Shakespeare, he appears to be putting a great deal on the line. In the song " Sara, " Dylan sings of " staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel, / Writing ' Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ' for you. " That puts me, for one, in mind of Prospero. At one point near the end of Neil Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the parts are sung by Young, the character " Grampa " erupts with a complaint : " That guy just keeps singin '! / Can somebody shut him up? / I do n't know for the life of me / where he comes up with that stuff. " For my money, that 's a moment of comic and cosmic humility that ranks up there with " The Tale of Sir Thopas.
