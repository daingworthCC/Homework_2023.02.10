4015041 Section : Articles Summary <p> Background Compulsory urine testing of prisoners for drugs, a control initiative, was introduced in eight prisons in England and Wales early in 1995. Despite no evidence of effectiveness, testing was extended to all prisons in England and Wales by March 1996. We consider the cost of testing. <p> Methods We combined the costs of refusals, confirmatory tests, punishment of confirmed positives for cannabis or for class A drugs to estimate the average costs of random compulsory drugs testing. These costs were then compared to : i) the healthcare budget for a prison ; and ii) the cost of putting in place a credible prisons ' drugs reduction programme. We then used Scottish data on incarceration and regional prevalence of injecting drug users to estimate the extent of the injecting drug use problem that prisons face. <p> Findings Costs per 28 days of the random mandatory drugs testing control initiative in an establishment for 500 inmates where refusal rate is a) 10% or b) nil ; and 35% of urine samples test positive, one tenth of them for class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and b) UK16000 per 28 days a) $US35100 and b) $US24600. This cost was equivalent to twice the cost of running a credible drugs reduction and rehabilitation programme, and around half the total healthcare expenditure for a prison of 500 which averaged UK41114 per 28 days$US64860. Major cost-generating events were the punishment of refusals -- over one third of cost a) -- and testing positive for cannabis -- over 50% of cost a). In Scotland, around 5% of injecting drug users( IDUs) are incarcerated at any time : 5% of Lothian 's drugs care, treatment and prevention costs and 2.5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget in 1993-94 amounted to UK101300 per annum -- or UK7770 per 28 days( $US11970) -- and about 35% of monthly MDT costs. <p> Interpretation We suggest that 5% of current resources for drugs prevention and treatment and for IDU-targetted HIV/AIDS prevention should be directed towards the prisons because in the prisons, where 5% of the clients are at any time, injectors have less access to harm reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 348 : 1124-27 Introduction <p> Compulsory urine testing for drugs in prisoners was introduced in eight prisons in England and Wales -- including Holloway( a women 's prison) -- early in 1995. Neither ethical and scientific arguments against compulsory tests as a means of gathering information '( 1) nor operational objections( 2) dissuaded the Prison Service from extending its war on drugs ' to all prison establishments in England and Wales by March 1996. <p> The 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act permits both random and on suspicion ' selection of prisoners from whom a urine sample can be required and tested for drugs. During the pilot phase of mandatory testing, random sampling has been organised from Prison Service headquarters. Refusal to provide the required urine sample breaches prison rules and is punishable by 28 days ' loss of remission. Prisoners whose urine sample tests positive for cannabis only are liable to punishment of 14 days ' loss of remission, and 21 days if their sample is positive for class A drugs such as heroin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory) drugs testing( MDT) to the healthcare budget for a prison and to the cost of putting in place a prisons ' drugs reduction programme. We compare average, not marginal, costs. The former will tend to the latter in the medium term, however, as additional prison places and staff are eventually required to avoid disorder in the prisons occasioned by overcrowding and undermanning. <p> We use data from Scotland to put in context the extent of the injecting drug use problem prisons face. Methods <p> Table 1 shows cost-generating events for MDT, unit costs, and applicable percentages from the MDT pilot study.( 3) We assume that 10% of prisoners are required to provide a urine sample, as in the pilot study. Refusal rate of between 0 and 10% is assumed, and was quoted as 8% in a personal communication in May, 1995 from the then Director-General of the Prison Service. We estimated the cost of loss of remission from the Prison Service Annual Report and Accounts( 4) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assumed to be positive on SYVA testing( 5) and to remain positive on confirmation by gas chromatography -- mass spectrometry( GC-MS). 20% urine samples negative on SYVA testing are assumed to be rechecked and confirmed as negative by GC-MS( this simplification ignores false positive and false negative SYVA test results.) <p> Cross-sectional Willing Anonymous Salivary HIV( WASH) surveillance studies and risk-factor elicitation in Scottish prisons6 and at Bullindon Prison near Oxford have shown that 20% or more( 6) prisoners have injected drugs ; that 50% of injectors have injected in prison, probably currently7 as well as ever.( 6) We therefore assume that 10% of all inmates inject class A drugs inside prison currently but the proportion who inject regularly, for example twice a week, has not been documented. A class A drug such as heroin remains detectable in urine for 3 days. <p> Answers to parliamentary questons in May 1995, concerning the outcome since February 1995, of MDT in pilot prisons,( 8) revealed that 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three for heroin/benzodiazepines. Our assumptions were based on these figures. Results <p> In accordance with the assumptions in table 1, tables 2a and b give estimates of the cost per 28 days of the random mandatory drugs testing control initiative in an establishment for 500 inmates where the refusal rate is 10%( table 2a) or 0%( table 2b) ; and 35% of urine samples test positive, one tenth of these for class A drugs as reported in Parliament in May 1995.( 8) Costs are estimated at between UK22 800( $US35 100) and UK16 000( $US24 600) per 28 days. Major cost-generating events are the punishment of refusals( more than 33% of cost in table 2a) and of testing positive for cannabis( over 50% of cost in table 2a and over 80% of cost in table 2b). Costs decrease roughly in proportion to any decrease in penalty days, because the cost of testing is relatively minor in terms of overall cost. <p> The 1993-94 Report of the Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure from April, 1993, to March, 1994, as UK58.215 million pounds( at 1993-94 prices) ; equivalent to UK4.4658 million per 28 days( $US6.877 million). Since the average prison occupancy for the same period was 53020, healthcare expenditure for an establishment with 500 prisoners averaged UK42114 per 28 days( $US64860). The cost of random MDT per 28 days is thus equivalent to about half the healthcare budget of such a prison. <p> Experts in treatment of drug abuse estimate that it costs UK100 000 per annum( $US154 000) to run a drugs reduction and rehabilitation programme in a prison with 500 inmates( personal communication, Mr Tony O'Regan, Co-ordinator of Drugs and Alcohol Services, Huntingdon, UK) ; less than half the cost of random MDT. <p> Table 3 shows regional data on estimated number of injecting drug users by capture-recapture methods.( 10-12) HIV prevalence in injectors from community HIV surveillance studies,( 13-15) together with number of injector-inmates derived from cross-sectional WASH surveillance studies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HIV-infected injector-inmates. Data on the size of populations( 20) were also required. The prevalence of injecting drug use varies geographically and prevalence in men may be almost twice that for women. HIV prevalence in current injecting drug users also varies geographically. It is, for example, much higher for injectors from Scotland 's east coast -- Lothian and Tayside regions -- than those from Greater Glasgow or Liverpool. Despite geographical variation in the prevalence of injecting drug use, consistently across the regions about 7% of male injectors are in prison at any time. The proportion is lower for women ; only 1% of Greater Glasgow 's female injectors were in Cornton Vale, Scotland 's only prison for female offenders.( 6, 19) We thus estimate that 5.4%( table 3, 469/8700) of Greater Glasgow 's injectors are in prison at any time( this is the only region in the UK with all necessary data available for both sexes). <p> Corroboration comes from another source. The Scottish Affairs Committee, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) estimated that there were 20 000 injecting drug users in Scotland, or some 11 300 outside Greater Glasgow. Two thirds of these, around 7500, would be expected to be male. Cross-sectional WASH surveillance in 1991-95 covered some 40% of the Scottish male prison population and included 150 male drug injectors from outside Greater Glasgow( table 3). This leads to an estimate of 375( 150/0.4) non-Glasgow injectors in all prisons for men, or 5% of male injectors outside of Greater Glasgow being in prison at any time. <p> Thus, since 5% of a region 's injectors are incarcerated at any time, it would appear reasonable that around 5% of the region 's drugs prevention and treatment budget and an apportionment of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget should be assigned to its prisons. Lothian 's 1993-94 Drug Abuse Services cost UK138 473 for care and treatment, and UK1052 029 for prevention ; and the AIDS/HIV projects cost UK5079171 for care and treatment and 1670277 for prevention( totals of UK1190 552 and 6749 488, respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half Lothian 's HIV diagnoses have been in injecting drug users,( 20) we assume that half the region 's HIV/AIDS prevention budget has targeted injectors. Five percent of Lothian 's drugs care, treatment and prevention costs and 2.5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget amounts to UK101 300 -- or UK7770 per 28 days( $US11 970) -- and about 35% of monthly MDT costs. <p> After the parliamentary questions in May 1995, further questions elicited the information that from February to May, 1995, there were 1089 random MDT tests, of which 362( 33.2%) were positive for cannabis and 44( 4.1%) positive for opiates or benzodiazepines : but from June to December 1995, when there were 2282 random tests, 663( 29.1%) were positive for cannabis and 168( 7.4%) for opiates or benzodiazepines. This is an 80% increase in the percentage of inmates testing positive for opiates or benzodiazepines. Since provisional assault figures for 1995 for the pilot prisons also show a 20% increase in assaults over 1993-94 figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, at best, MDT has zero effectiveness in countering addiction and disorder ; we do so implicitly hereafter. Discussion <p> Research has shown that starting to inject drugs inside prison is associated with longer sentences as well as with local and individual prison-related factors.( 23) Certainly, the issue of drug use in prison can not be tackled in isolation. The World Health Organization( 24) and the 1994/95 Report of the Director of Prison Healthcare( 25) recommend that healthcare in prisons should, wherever possible, be equivalent to that outside. Because most injecting drug users enter the prison system( 26) after remand for a drugs-related offence or for theft or prostitution to fund their habit, prisons provide a unique opportunity to target educational and drugs rehabilitation programmes towards them at a time of potential receptivity but also vulnerability from loss of self-esteem and inevitable stress. <p> A major part of the Prison Service 's strategy to reduce drug misuse in prison is the introduction of MDT to identify drug users, punish them and offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently unresourced,( 27) to Scotland from February, 1996. Our analysis of average costs raises questions about a policy which apparently is ineffective in terms of reducing addiction and assaults.( 3) <p> We estimate that at any one time about 5% of the UK 's injecting drug users are in prison. This would suggest that a similar proportion of education, rehabilitation, and support resources should be available to the prisons, a far larger figure than is identifiable in current budgets. However, this investment would represent only between 35% and 50% of the costs of MDT, over half of which is incurred as extra days in prison for cannabis takers. The control initiative of MDT has not produced anticipated benefits.( 3) A supportive drug substitution and rehabilitation programme would introduce immediate and longer-term benefits both for the prison and for the outside community in reduced recidivism. It is possible that loss of remission as the result of positive urine tests or refusal may reinforce the very reason for taking drugs -- escape from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place.( 28, 29) <p> Our costing of MDT does not include the hidden human cost of acquiring HIV or Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection by using contaminated injection equipment. We welcome, however, the recent availability of disinfection tablets in UK prisons. Existing drug rehabilitation schemes in prison are under-resourced, resulting in waiting lists in prisons with large numbers of injecting drug users, such as Saughton and Glenochil Prisons in Scotland.( 30) Investment in, and priority for, MDT in England and Wales is unlikely to be matched immediately by parallel investment in drug rehabilitation programmes, despite the exhortation of a Parliamentary Select Committee. We argue that resources which are already available in the community outside should be redistributed on a direct apportionment basis to the prison medical services as part of a long-term initiative on prison healthcare, and we suggest a figure of 5%. The problem of drug use, and especially of injecting drug use, is a substantial and shared one for both the prison service and the populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both within and between these overlapping constituencies ; and should not overlook the long-term risks to health of even the shortest period of experimentation with shared injecting drug use. <p> The MDT programme alienates prisoners,( 31) is prejudicial to voluntary anonymous studies( 32, 6) which, until now, have measured the prevalence and risks of injecting drug use in prisons and, as we show in this analysis, diverts scarce prison resources from preventive and rehabilitation programmes which are likely to benefit prisoners ' welfare, and the public 's health. There is no lack of willingness on part of prisons to tackle this issue sympathetically and professionally.( 30) The strong geographical correlation between deprivation and injection drug use( 11) can not be resolved by the prisons alone but concerns all society. <p>
