4003541 THE GROWING INFLUX of immigrants that troubled America 's elite in the early twentieth century gave rise to a movement to assimilate the newcomers as quickly as possible. 1 Several characteristics of the new immigrants disturbed native-born Americans. They entered the United States from southern and eastern Europe, regarded as inferior to the northern and western sections of the continent, the main source of earlier immigration. For the most part, they differed in religion from the Protestant majority in the United States. They tended to crowd into cities, where the population density of their districts was more visible and disturbing than scattered, rural immigrant settlements. Native-born Americans, who may have grown up in areas now occupied by immigrants, uncomfortably sensed that they were passing through a foreign land when they revisited the neighborhoods of their youth. <p> Many observers perceived the problem posed by large-scale immigration, and many schemes were advanced to deal with its troubling growth. The Immigration Restriction League sought to reduce the number of entrants through a literacy test. The American Protective Association embodied a blatant anti-Catholicism which appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also advocated restriction. Some Americans, however, articulated a somewhat more balanced perspective regarding the newcomers. Chicago 's Immigrants ' Protective League recognized that the immigrants were capable of contributing to the growth of the United States without undermining its character. The League 's goal nonetheless was to turn the immigrants into " middle-class Americans, accepting the nation 's core values and displaying their European past only as quaint, aesthetic variations on a general American type. " 2 <p> The nation 's elite concurrently fretted over the need for an adequate supply of military manpower to enhance America 's status as a great power. 3 Immigrants posed only part of the problem, but an important part nonetheless given their number, at a time when reformers were struggling to modernize the army. They had to reverse a congressional ban, enacted in 1894, on enlisting men who could not speak English before the army could play its role in Americanizing the immigrant. By the time the nation intervened in World War I poor command of English no longer prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first segregated in so-called developmental battalions. 4 <p> The outbreak of the war produced a number of proposals in the American immigrant population to mobilize in support of the various countries of origin. The neutrality of the United States circumscribed all of these plans, though nothing prevented individual men from leaving the country to enlist in one of the belligerent forces. After the United States associated itself with the Allies in April, 1917, they began to enlist their nationals living in America. Once again plans that had surfaced in 1914 were revived. Several groups, deprived of states which they acknowledged as homelands, offered to form military units of varying size, affiliated with one or all of the Allies in the common struggle against the Central Powers. Their hope was to free their native regions from foreign occupation and establish new national states. The most visible and successful of these efforts was the Polish American Army, formally designated the Polish Army in France, which had to come to terms with the American draft before it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has received its share of attention in studies of the American military experience in the Great War. 5 Less well known are the recruiting efforts of the European Allies in the United States, though the Provost Marshal General 's reports discuss their work during the period of American intervention. 6 A similar campaign unfolded in the Polish-American community, often referred to as Polonia, with the reluctant authorization of the federal government. What distinguished it and a comparable movement for the Czecho-Slovak Army in France from the American and Allied efforts was the absence of existing governments to which these military formations were responsible. Though the student of World War I finds references to these units, 7 there is no extended treatment of this topic in the available literature. The focus of this study is the relationship between the American draft and the American Polonia 's drive to raise an army for the western front. <p> The Selective Service System was organized after the passage of the Act establishing it on 18 May 1917. 8 Congress approved this legislation six weeks after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Germany and the United States. Between these two dates Congress debated the nature of the force the country needed in order to do its share in the common struggle against the Central Powers. Conscious of the draft riots which had occurred during the Civil War, many congressmen wanted to avoid a recurrence by relying on a volunteer army. The draft had such an odious connotation that Secretary of the Interior Frank K. Lane counseled Secretary of War Newton D. Baker to substitute " some euphemism, such as ' Universal Service ' or ' Democratic Service ' bill " when urging its adoption. 9 President Woodrow Wilson intended at first to rely on volunteers to provide the manpower for the American Expeditionary Force( AEF) until former President Theodore Roosevelt demanded authorization to recruit and command a volunteer division. 10 After thorough consideration Congress passed and the president signed the Selective Service Act. The registration it mandated for men twenty-one to thirty years of age was quickly set for June 5, because Gen. Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized the draft. 11 <p> Meanwhile, in France a series of events occurred which would have an impact on the functioning of the American draft. On May 20, two days after the Selective Service Act was passed, the French Minister of War Paul Painleve established the Franco-Polish Military Mission. Reporting to the French President Raymond Poincare on June 4, the day before registration in the United States, he and Alexander Ribot, the President of the Council of Ministers as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, adverted to the presence of Poles in the French Army since the start of the war and the Allied intention to restore a Polish state. The report specifically mentioned the Russian Provisional Government 's statement favoring Polish self-determination, because to the end the czarist government rejected British and French urgings of broader autonomy for Poland after the war. The ministers appended a six-point decree, which President Poincare signed, creating a Polish Army in France. 12 <p> On June 6 Poincare appointed Gen. Louis Archinard head of the Franco-Polish Military Mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest number of men for the Polish Army from the Polish community in the United States. 13 They had plausible reasons for this expectation. Ambassador J. J. Jusserand had met repeatedly with the president of the Polish Falcon Alliance, Teofil Starzynski, before American intervention. 14 Prominent Poles in France, in particular Waclaw Gasiorowski, a popular author and journalist, convinced the government that many Polish Americans would volunteer for the army. 15 Perhaps most persuasive was the entry of the United States as an associated power into the struggle against the Central Powers. France needed manpower, as Marshal Joseph Joffre informed his hosts in April during his visit to America, and the Polish Army provided the means of shoring up the French forces. 16 <p> But France would have to wait until October before it could enlist Polish-American volunteers. In the meantime the United States established the draft, starting with registration on June 5. Despite widespread skepticism it occurred without difficulty. Almost ten million men reported as directed. The pool from which the draftees would be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alien enemies who have declared their intention to become citizens, between the ages of twenty-one and thirty years, both inclusive. " 17 <p> The next step toward the draft was a lottery to determine the order in which men would be called. This occurred on July 20. In the meantime General Crowder as Provost Marshal General apportioned the quotas among the states on the basis of the total number of registrants in each jurisdiction. Once the order of the call was determined, the local boards could then summon men for induction. 18 <p> Here an unforeseen difficulty arose. Though all men within the designated ages were required to register, only citizens and alien declarants were liable for service. Thus, the total of registrants included enemy aliens, i.e., residents born in Germany who could not be drafted. To confuse matters more, some declarants were technically enemy aliens, whom the law excluded from service. An obvious example was a Pole born in Germany. To compensate for ineligible registrants, local boards had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotments. States with large immigrant populations, such as Illinois, were especially vulnerable in this respect. Subsequent drafts adjusted the quotas for this imbalance. 19 <p> Before the first draftees reached camp, the French, dissatisfied with the lack of American reinforcements for the Polish Army, dispatched a six-man military mission to the United States. Lt. Waclaw Gasiorowski, one of the army 's most ardent promoters, headed the group. Negotiations with Americans were to be the responsibility of 2d Lt. Stanislaw Poniatowski, whose father was a French banker with American interests. His surname, shared with the last king of Poland during the era of the partitions in the eighteenth century, as well as one of Napoleon 's generals, also aroused a patriotic response in Polish America. Sergeants Wlodzimierz Szaniawski and Henryk Rzekiecki and Cpl. M. Mazurek accompanied the officers on their travels. The sixth member of the delegation was Stefan Rejer, president of the Polish miners in France. He came to appeal for volunteers among Polish-American miners. 20 <p> The Mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chamber of Deputies, whose overt reason for visiting the United States was to promote an Interallied Parliament. In fact, Minister of War Painleve had given him a letter of introduction to Secretary of War Baker. It revealed that Franklin-Bouillon 's mission was to investigate " all questions concerning the recruitment of the Czech Legion and of the Polish Legion destined for France. " Before his return in mid-September he reached agreement on recruitment for the army with the Chicago-based agency( Polish National Department) that represented most of the Polish organizations in America and attended a rally at Carnegie Hall for Czech independence. 21 <p> One concern that prolonged negotiations was doubt among Polonia 's leaders that the United States would allow recruitment for the army. Repeated assurances from the French visitors failed to satisfy the National Department, until its representatives consulted Washington. They had, after all, raised the possibility of a Polish force in the United States Army as early as February, 1917, without success. Even then, after French assurance, the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the conditions under which recruitment would operate. A three-member military commission was appointed on September 20, and by October 6 the War Department issued a statement endorsing recruitment for the Polish Army in France. 22 <p> The statement also emphasized however that " no individual of Polish nationality resident in the United States who is in any way subject to the draft will be accepted as a recruit by this military commission. " Practically identical phrasing appeared in a letter from one of the commissioners to the State Department. It further promised to refrain from recruiting " any man whose family would be left without means of support " and to be " discreet " in publicizing the army. 23 <p> The agreement may have satisfied the Wilson administration, the French government and the Polish National Department, but the clear language of the documents blurred when applied to the local recruiting effort. The fault lay as much with the Selective Service network as with overzealous Polish-American recruiting officers and sergeants. General Crowder noted " the desire of the representatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own commanders and to join immediately the allied forces in the battlefield. " He saw no hindrance if the volunteers were less than twenty-one or over thirty years old. As for men of draft age, he divided them into three categories :( 1) " technically enemy aliens, who could not be admitted to the American Army, and, therefore, might well be released to these foreign legions " ;( 2) men " in deferred or exempted classes... if they were willing to fight, they might as well fight in the American Army " ; and( 3) men in Class I who " might go into the field earlier if they were permitted to enlist in the foreign legions. " 24 <p> Crowder specifically mentioned Russian Poles as examples of the second category who, as subjects of an Allied State, were liable for service in the Russian Army. Polish Americans posed a complicated problem, because, if aliens, they were formally subjects of Germany, Austria or Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become citizens were enemy aliens. This meant Alsatians as well as Poles, though Americans understood the situation with respect to Alsace-Lorraine better than the Polish case. In his report Crowder noted " a large share of anti-German aliens, belonging to other race stocks who were enemies in a purely technical sense. " 25 <p> Of the men registered on June 5 about forty-one thousand were German subjects. Almost a thousand German nondeclarants somehow wound up in camp as a result of the draft. Crowder opined that a greater number of German declarants were drafted by the end of the year. Many nondeclarants at the time of registration had since then applied for first papers. When the United States declared war on Austria-Hungary in December, the numbers of both alien enemy declarants and nondeclarants in camp jumped tremendously. Crowder estimated that some nine thousand nondeclarants had waived their exemption by reason of alienage. 26 <p> It appears that the War Department did not consult Crowder during the negotiations regarding the Polish Army. Initially, there seemed to be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France. The Provost Marshal General concentrated on supplying the manpower that the AEF needed. <p> In November Gov. John J. Cornwall of West Virginia inquired whether Polish draftees should be released to the recruiting officer at Wheeling for transport to the Polish Army Camp at Niagara on the Lake, Ontario. Crowder responded that they should not. Earlier in the month he informed Gov. James B. Goodrich of Indiana that Czechs and Slovaks with first papers were ineligible to enlist in the Czecho-Slovak Army. 27 <p> In late December, three months after Polish recruitment began, Crowder received a letter from the Bureau of Investigation in the Justice Department reporting that a twenty-three year old man from Pittsburgh had volunteered for the Polish Army and, deemed physically unfit, was sent home from the Polish Army camp. Crowder replied that he would look into the possibility that recruitment for the Polish Army was interfering with the draft. He was not unduly concerned at this point, possibly because a candidate unfit for service in the Polish Army was unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same month the United States Fuel Administrator Harry A. Garfield, seeking to assure an adequate supply of coal during an exceptionally harsh winter, transmitted two letters from W. H. Wilson, vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Company, to the War Department. The first asserted that " some 2,500 Polish miners " worked for the company and called attention to the British and Canadian experience with conscripted miners who had to be returned to the coal fields. Garfield 's cover letter concluded that " the public interest " required that recruitment for the Polish Army " should not be encouraged. " 29 <p> Col. P. D. Lochridge, acting chief of the General Staff 's War College Division, found sufficient merit in Garfield 's argument to warrant a reconsideration of the official American attitude toward recruitment for the Polish Army. Citing an amendment to the criminal code, he underscored the use of the word country in its proviso. Crowder, functioning as the Army 's Judge Advocate General, had earlier interpreted this word to allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident in the United States. Lochridge equated the term country with government and observed : " In Poland, at the present time, there is no duly accredited Polish government. The government existing in Poland is the government of our enemy. " This interpretation raised the question whether official policy in this matter was in conflict with the law. 30 <p> These reservations received confirmation from the Judge Advocate General 's office on December 28. Accordingly, a letter ordering the Provost Marshal General to " stop further enlistments for the so-called Polish legions " and another for Garfield were drafted for the Secretary of War 's signature, but both remained undated and unsigned. <p> With respect to drafting miners Crowder informed Baker that the Fuel Administration 's request for exemptions was unwarranted. Of a total of 600,000 miners about a third registered on June 5, of whom 74,000 were called by local boards. The actual number of coal miners drafted to date was 18,710. This provided an " almost negligible " ratio of 3.13 percent.( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located at Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, as of 31 December 1917.) The Provost Marshal General expressed the fear that these exemptions, if granted, would lead to requests from other industries and urged the secretary to reject them. 31 <p> Both President Wilson and Secretary Baker accepted Crowder 's position. Responding to the questions of exemptions and the legality of Polish recruitment, Baker testily informed Garfield that it was authorized " after very careful consideration of this subject in all of its phases, national as well as international. " The secretary further remarked that " this law will permit Poles who are subjects of Russia, for example, and who are not within the draft age, to enlist for the Polish Army. " He dismissed the War College 's strained interpretation that the Polish Army was somehow hostile to American interests because of the German occupation of Poland. 32 <p> Why the War College suddenly developed scruples over the legality of the Polish Army is puzzling. The letter initiating the review of Polish recruitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would augment. But W. H. Wilson 's main concern was his company 's work force. Garfield too did not wish to see coal mining disrupted. The General Staff officers who took up the matter adopted the same approach and introduced a legal complication. This concern may have reflected a genuine fear that the War Department had inadvertently violated the law in authorizing recruitment. <p> Another possible explanation of this development may be that W. H. Wilson, Garfield and the officers did not fully comprehend the Department 's action regarding the Polish Army in France. The potential for confusion was great, nor was it limited to the American military. Despite the clear official announcement of October 6, the Department received repeated requests for verification of the recruiting centers ' right to function. <p> It is also possible that the military had never completely agreed with the decision, though they had no choice earlier but to obey Baker. The letters from the Delaware and Hudson Company then provided a chance to reopen the matter with new arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoranda, neither W. H. Wilson, Garfield, nor the War College carried their point with the Secretary of War, and the Polish Military Commission continued its work. <p> This correspondence was prelude to the overlapping throughout 1918 of the Selective Service System and the Polish recruiting effort. Their interaction did not differ significantly from Selective Service 's problems with other foreign recruiting missions in the United States. In May, 1917, Crowder as Judge Advocate General interpreted a change in section 10 of the Penal Code to allow allies of the United States to recruit nondeclarant aliens in the country for service with Allied forces. Prior to the change this was illegal under section 10. Should a declarant alien enlist in these forces, his military oath of allegiance would nullify " his declaration of intention to abjure all foreign allegiance. " The memorandum alluded to the British and Canadian desire for American assistance in recruitment. Crowder saw no problem in such cooperation. 33 <p> The problem of alien overrepresentation in certain regions, along with Britain 's concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to negotiations in July. By September 17 the State Department, after consulting the War Department, submitted a draft treaty to Britain, France, Italy and Greece. At this point, too, the Wilson administration was close to sanctioning Polish recruitment in the United States. The Polish matter was, of course, part of the French negotiations. Despite the progress on the treaties, the first agreement, with Britain, was not signed until June, 1918. 34 <p> In the meantime recruitment for Allied forces continued on the basis of the Judge Advocate General 's opinion of May, whose terms had induced the British to propose a treaty. The president of Local Board 3 of Duluth, Minnesota, J. D. Mahoney, indignantly reported the activity of Captain Bonner, " a low down cur. " One of six to ten Canadian recruiters in the area, he defied the local Justice Department agent to stop him. For February and March, 1918, Mahoney reported that the Canadians had recruited 193 men, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drafted. Later, one American recruit in the Canadian Army reported acting " under the influence of liquor " when he enlisted. 35 <p> Such abuses served as a background for complaints against Polish recruitment which reached the War and State Departments at the same time. Once again Duluth was involved. A. Bruce Bielaski, head of the Bureau of Investigation, informed Crowder on 12 March 1918 that local board 3 demanded the release of a man classified IA who was at the Polish Army Camp. Local board 1 reported that two men with the same classification were in the Polish Army. 36 <p> Crowder, who wrote in late February that the Polish Army encompassed " Poles, Bohemians, Slovaks and Czechs, resident in the United States, " was somewhat confused with regard to its recruitment. He attributed the problems to misunderstanding in the recruiting centers and stations. He had no quarrel with enlistment of men younger than twenty-one or older than thirty, as long as their classification was VF, which indicated that they were nondeclarant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Military Attache. Military Intelligence had already worked out a procedure with him to forestall violation of Selective Service regulations. The French would submit a list of men bound for France two weeks before departure. Copies would go to the Provost Marshal General, the Department of Justice and Military Intelligence, which would also assign an officer to monitor the embarcation of the recruits. 38 <p> The Bureau of Investigation on February 21 also approached the Polish Military Mission in the person of its liaison with the French High Commission, Col. James Martin. From his conversation with Agent S. D. Bradley it became clear that, though the colonel knew that men subject to the draft were ineligible for the Polish Army, he did not realize that this provision excluded men with first papers. This interview may have resulted from an earlier complaint to Secretary of State Robert Lansing from J. J. Blachowski of Saint Paul, who reported that recruiting officers for the Polish Army promised promotion to the rank of officer to men who transferred from the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Department, which was also informed of the Martin interview. 39 <p> In March another violation of recruiting guidelines came to the attention of the State Department. Julius Danielewski of Milwaukee wrote to President Wilson that his son Frank, a minor born in Chicago, had enlisted in the Polish Army. The Department asked for proof of the boy 's citizenship or the father 's naturalization papers before contacting the Military Commission. His release was requested on April 30, but in March the soldier had sailed for France. The State Department nonetheless demanded his discharge and return, asserting that his enlistment violated section 10 of the Penal Code as amended on 7 May 1917. 40 <p> Yet the State Department revealed earlier that it did not thoroughly understand the terms under which Polish recruitment was authorized. When it informed the Provost Marshal General of the impending departure of Polish and Czech volunteers for France, according to the plan worked out in late February, it also instructed the Treasury Department that French " identification certificates " sufficed for naturalized American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made special arrangements. " The Acting Secretary of War Benedict Crowell quickly corrected this misconception, asserting that no such arrangements existed and all American citizens were ineligible to join the Polish Army. 41 <p> Crowder sought to clear up the confusion in early March by sending a telegram to all governors which stated that only Class V registrants, aliens who had not declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, could enlist in the Polish Army. The governors were to instruct local boards to enforce this ruling. The Adjutant General of New York, however, considered this procedure inadequate, because volunteers proceeded to the Polish Army camp without informing their local boards. 42 <p> These incidents demonstrated that the apparently straightforward language of both the Provost Marshal General 's instructions and the agreement authorizing Polish Army recruitment eluded both American officials and Polish recruiters. Given the many people involved in both recruitment efforts, this confusion is not surprising. As problems emerged, the Provost Marshal General issued revised instructions to deal with them. Since most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could anticipate that mistakes would occur in the application of guidelines. The situation of citizens and nondeclarants was relatively simple with respect to foreign recruitment. Citizens could only serve in the AEF, and nondeclarants could choose service in either foreign or American forces. The major problem surfaced with the declarant alien. Not yet a citizen, he was regarded by most Allied recruiting missions as a potential volunteer, though under the Selective Service Act he was subject to the draft. If he refused to serve or enlisted in an Allied force, he thereby renounced his right to become an American citizen. Yet even the Provost Marshal General was ready to relax all these prescriptions occasionally. 43 <p> In February, 1918, a new Polish Mission arrived to replace the one which had inaugurated recruitment. Maj. Joseph Kozlowski took the place of Lieutenant Gasiorowski, who in any case had run afoul of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the piano virtuoso who spoke for Polonia. Gasiorowski criticized Paderewski 's close ties to the Polish National Committee in Paris, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When Paderewski got involved in a project, he expected everyone to carry out his orders without question. Thus he completely rejected Gasiorowski 's critique. The French, who understood the importance of Paderewski 's support, complied with the maestro 's insistence on full control of recruitment. 44 <p> By this time Gasiorowski and others were concerned that recruitment had slowed down and the goal of one hundred thousand men would not be reached. It occurred to many involved in Polish Army recruitment that the men classified V by Selective Service local boards were an untapped pool of volunteers. <p> On January 11 the Saint Paul Polish Citizens Committee requested representation on each local board for access to the addresses of Polish aliens. Crowder instructed the Minnesota Adjutant General to make his own decision whether to grant this favor. If he consented, he was to supervise its implementation. 45 <p> On February 23 the recruiting officer in Cleveland wired a request to Crowder for the names of all Poles in Class V in the city. Crowder refused to provide this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compile such a list, provided this neither interfered with the functioning of local boards nor drew upon their funds. 46 <p> In April Major Kozlowski sent requests directly to the state Adjutants General for lists of Polish Class V registrants, without going through the proper channels. 47 The officers consulted Washington, which brought this matter to the attention of the State and War Departments. In turn, the State Department informed the French High Commission of the breach in protocol. The French apologized, informing the State Department that Kozlowski had been instructed to send any further requests through the French High Commission. 48 <p> Recruiting centers used the information on Class V registrants innovatively. In Wilkes-Barre and its vicinity the center sent out " The Summoning Card. " In one long sentence the pink postcard asserted that the recipient was bound, " on the strength of privileges given the center by the United States Government, " to appear for a medical examination and service in the Polish Army. When informed of this practice, the State Department advised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of War. Recruiting center 2 at Chicago also mailed " cleverly drawn up " letters implying that Class V registrants " must enlist in the Polish Army, " until warned in May by the Bureau of Investigation to change this message. 49 <p> There remained the problem of what to do with men improperly recruited for the Polish Army. In response to pleas from Paderewski and the French High Commission, the War Department allowed 113 volunteers with first papers, who had completed training in Canada, to stay in the Polish Army. The Department assumed that the men involved were Poles, " many of whom probably understand thoroughly no language but the Polish. " Their availability " for immediate service at the front among men of their own national aspirations " and the negative impact their discharge would have on further recruitment for the Polish Army persuaded the American authorities to agree in this case. 50 <p> But this was not meant to be a precedent. The War Department intended to enforce the law regarding enlistment in foreign armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively on the recruiting officer. The military intelligence officer present at the embarcation of the volunteers could deny ineligible men permission to board the transport. He would determine this status by checking the nominal lists the French High Commission submitted two weeks prior to departure. Despite the advance notice military intelligence did not always identify ineligible volunteers. By July it relinquished the task of checking the nominal lists to the Provost Marshal General 's office. 51 <p> At the same time the War Department slowly recognized that unlawful recruitment was not the only reason for the enlistment of ineligible men. There were repeated instances of their voluntary entry in all the Allied forces, such as the case of Frank Danielewski cited above. 52 The volume of correspondence generated in trying to rectify the situation led the War Department, with the concurrence of the State Department, to formulate a rule for handling such violations. The War Department would demand the release of a volunteer subject to the draft only if the violation was discovered before transport to Europe. The result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines between the recruiting missions and the volunteer. 53 <p> To confuse matters further, Congress ordered the reluctant War Department to raise a Slavic Legion in the summer of 1918. The military had not favored recruitment for the Polish Army in September, 1917, and revealed continued opposition by supporting the United States Fuel Commissioner 's objections to recruitment in January, 1918. The War Department responded in the negative in October, 1917, to a proposal to raise a " Russian Legion " in the United States for the western front. It repeated this response to a similar proposal in March, 1918. In short, ethnic units had no appeal for the American military. Yet Congress passed a law mandating the Slavic Legion in July, 1918. 54 <p> This action caused the French to seek clarification of the measure. The initial proposal encompassed Polish, Czech, Slovak and Yugoslav immigrants resident in the United States. The rider, attached to the Army Appropriation Act of July 9, deleted Poles from and added Ruthenians to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed during the period in which Congress debated intervention in Siberia, the law left the assignment of the force to the discretion of the president. 55 <p> In addition to the Polish Army, France had established a CzechoSlovak Army which received authorization in May to enlist Czech and Slovak Americans under the same conditions that applied to the Polish Military Commission. Earlier, the Serbian Mission had enlisted Czech and Slovak volunteers in the United States. The French were understandably concerned that the proposed Slavic Legion would hamper the growth of the Polish and Czecho-Slovak Armies. 56 <p> As of June 30, 11,638 Polish volunteers had sailed for France. The War Plans Division of the General Staff reported in July that 16,000 men, mostly from the United States, were in the Polish Army and that only 1000 Czech and Slovak immigrants had volunteered in America. As the army prepared to comply with the law, prodded on by Congressman Adolph J. Sabath of Chicago, one of the sponsors of the Slavic Legion, the War Plans Division projected a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Slovaks and 8,000 Ruthenians. The Division argued against recruiting in coal mining regions, " as the services of men of these races, employed in coal mining, is more valuable to the Government in that capacity than in the Army. " This assertion recalls the challenge to Polish Army recruitment of January and supports the conclusion that the General Staff would have preferred not to bother with the Slavic Legion. 57 <p> The War Department finally issued the regulations for the Slavic Legion on 5 October 1918, but when the Armistice took effect on November 11, nothing had been done to begin recruitment. Two days later Maj. General Frank McIntyre, executive assistant to the Chief of Staff, informed Crowder : " These regulations with reference to the Slavic Legion will be killed. We are dropping the Slavic Legion altogether &; making no effort to form one so they will not be necessary. " In retrospect, the French, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks need not have worried about the Slavic Legion. 58 <p> Another complication intruded upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when a third registration encompassing men from eighteen to forty-five years old was held. The questionnaire asked for the registrant 's citizenship. When Czechs and Slovaks, knowing that the United States had recognized the Czecho-Slovak National Council as a cobelligerent on September 3, responded " Czecho-Slovak, claimed as subject of Austria-Hungary, " local boards refused to record this answer. 59 <p> On registration day the Daily Slovak American reported to Crowder that New York local boards were not complying with instructions. The Provost Marshal General instructed the city 's Director of the Draft to reply to the paper and " take appropriate corrective measures if necessary. " It may be that the local boards were in compliance, but the registrant technically remained, despite his response, an enemy alien. The distinction, which applied to German and Austrian Poles, Alsace-Lorrainers and others, may have been too subtle for the average registrant and even for the average editor. 60 <p> This problem surfaced as soon as America entered the war. Polish immigrants, just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany or Austria, when they had no love for either empire. Throughout 1918 Paderewski approached the State Department for authority to issue certificates of Polish nationality. He achieved limited success. Immigrants from Alsace-Lorraine gained a similar concession. Czechs and Slovaks, however, did not yet share this privilege. 61 <p> Nonetheless, German and Austrian subjects remained enemy aliens under American law. Selective Service officials debated the problem until the Armistice rendered it moot. One officer in the agency argued that American recognition of the Czechs and Slovaks as cobelligerents nullified the legal technicality. Others insisted that congressional action was necessary to change the classification of enemy alien. Selective Service responded to protests over classification by directing the correspondents to the Slavic Legion. Yet it is hard to imagine that Crowder did not realize the General Staff 's reluctance to expedite its formation. On August 8 Congress authorized Selective Service to halt all voluntary enlistment for the armed forces, in order that the local boards could fulfill their assigned quotas without difficulty. At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Slavic Legion. In alluding to it Crowder may have been trying to relieve the pressure applied to Selective Service by indignant Czechs and Slovaks. 62 <p> While the agency sought a way out of this problem, Congressman Sabath intervened. Representing the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago, he had numerous Czech and Slovak constituents who protested their classification. In October, Crowder had to explain the agency 's behavior to Sabath. Just before the Armistice he informed the congressman that he believed he had found a way to resolve the difficulty. After November 11, however, the problem lost its urgency. 63 <p> With the Armistice, Selective Service relaxed its supervision over recruitment for the Polish Army, which continued to enlist volunteers until 15 February 1919. In December the transportation officer inquired how to respond to American immigration officials at the Canadian border who demanded a release from the local board before allowing volunteers to cross into Canada. Crowder replied that they no longer needed such releases. Responding in January, 1919, to a native-born American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal General provided the text of section 10 of the Penal Code. His final words nonetheless contained this advice, " It may be possible for you to enlist in a Polish force outside of the United States. " 64 <p> During the eighteen months of its work the military commission sent 20,720 men to the Polish Army in France. When the army was transferred to Poland in April, 1919, it consisted of some 68,000 men. Thus, the American contribution, including over 200 Canadians, made up almost one-third of the force. This number fell short of the 100,000 men anticipated when Paderewski first proposed raising a Polish-American force to be called Kosciuszko 's Army under the auspices of the United States in April 1917. But it was an impressive showing for a state that only took shape at the end of the war. The British and Canadians, who started recruiting six months earlier than the Poles, together raised about two and a half times this number. 65 <p> Yet recruitment in the United States encountered vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KON from its Polish acronym. Grouping the few leftist elements in Polonia, the organization professed adherence to the course followed by Joseph Pilsudski in Poland. He had fought with the Austrians against the Russians and later agreed for a time to raise a force within the Polish districts from which Germany had driven the Russian Army in 1915. KON feared that the conservative exiles in western Europe, whose vision of a restored Poland differed from Pilsudski 's, would use the Polish Army in France to achieve their goals. The Polish National Committee based in Paris did acquire full control over the army nine months after its creation, but proved incapable of manipulating it for its political benefit in Poland. These considerations also engaged the leadership of Polonia 's feuding organizations, but for the most part hardly mattered to the volunteers who joined the army. Selective Service, whose concern was to field an American Army, was oblivious to the dispute, through military intelligence paid attention to it because of the appearance of pro-German sympathy within KON. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Polish Council of State, a body established under German occupation as a precursor to a promised postwar " Polish Kingdom. " But there is no way to gauge how all this helped or hindered recruitment in America. 66 <p> Once accorded the right to recruit, the military commission received the same consideration that the other Allied recruiting missions had in the United States. Formally the Poles operated under the French Mission, and the French High Commission regularly handled communication regarding the army. This statement, nonetheless, masks the confusion which attended Polish Army recruitment. Similar confusion existed with regard to the more familiar Allied missions, but it cleared up somewhat once treaties regarding recruitment were signed in 1918. There was no state with which the United States could negotiate such a treaty with respect to Polish recruitment. American recognition of the Polish National Committee in Paris simply acknowledged its representation of Polish interests. Finally, in January, 1919, when Polish recruiting in America was approaching an end, the United States established diplomatic relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a treaty had disappeared. 67 <p> American military authorities expressed varied opinions on the use of Polish-American manpower in the war. Some were loathe to surrender the immigrant to the Allies, because they refused to relinquish reserves the country might need in the struggle against Germany. Yet many commanding officers objected to the immigrant soldier in their units, because they considered him inferior to the native-born enlisted man. 68 <p> Complaints about " undesirables " in the training camps reflected the attitude toward recent immigrants prevalent in the society from which the officers were drawn. It revolved around the fear that loyalty to the land of birth would displace the immigrant 's love for his adopted country. In the case of Polish immigrants this was improbable. Their homeland was divided among three of the belligerents, for which few Polish Americans had any love. Polish leaders argued during the war whether alliance with one side or the other would more efficaciously accomplish their shared goal, an independent Poland. Each side envisioned a military force which could convince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas the Central Powers on the one hand and Russia on the other made limited promises in this direction, neither was really willing to contemplate a truly independent Polish state. This is why many Polish immigrants enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to fight with the United States against the Central Powers. President Wilson had called attention to the Polish tragedy in his Peace without Victory speech in January, 1917, and referred to it again a year later when he framed the fourteen points. These statements convinced many Polish Americans that the president championed a Polish state, and consequently they inaccurately equated American and Polish war aims. When the administration rejected the proposal to raise a Polish unit within the AEF, many immigrants volunteered for the United States Army in order to get to the front as soon as possible. 69 <p> The army never kept an ethnic breakdown of volunteers and draftees, because it viewed itself as an Americanizing agency. After the war The Literary Digest estimated that the army had two hundred twenty thousand Poles in its ranks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualty lists, while the proportion of Poles in the country amounted to 4 percent. 70 <p> The number of draftees who did not understand English forced the army to deal with the problem in 1918 in a way that appeared to contradict its Americanizing role. The developmental battalions, which grouped immigrants in linguistically homogeneous companies, revealed the army 's mistaken presumptions. Under officers who spoke their language, one hundred twenty-nine thousand immigrants learned enough English to transfer to units destined for Europe. Paradoxically, by respecting the draftee 's native tongue, the army came closer to accomplishing its goal of integrating the immigrant into American society. 71 <p> By and large, Polish Army recruitment complemented the American draft, because it accepted volunteers younger and older than the men subject to it. Much of the early confusion over Polish Army recruitment in the United States had diminished by the time the war ended. Some puzzlement persisted over its continuation beyond the Armistice, but the War Department permitted the recruiting officers to enlist men and the final transports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely dissipated. As late as August, military intelligence supplied the Provost Marshal General with two tables of Polish-American population statistics based on the 1910 census in order to help Selective Service plan for the Slavic Legion. 72 As the most numerous Slavic group within the United States, Polish Americans may have seemed perfect candidates for the Legion, except that they were not among the groups designated in the law establishing it. Ironically, before the formation of the Polish Army in France, Poles in America had unsuccessfully sought such a unit within the American forces. Thus this episode in American ethnic history ended the way it began, with uncertainty and confusion over the status of Polish-American immigrants as military manpower. <p>
