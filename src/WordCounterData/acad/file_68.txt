4010441 ABSTRACT <p> Educational competence in students is an outcome of interrelationships among student characteristics and complex factors in the school setting and the home and family environment. Ratings on nine educationally relevant aspects of the home environment were summed ; differences in the home score among three categories of mildly handicapped students( EMR, LD, EBD) and nonhandicapped( NH) students were examined using analysis of covariance. Differences in home environments, independent of SES level, were found. Home environments for LD and NH students were rated significantly higher than home environments for EBD students. The need to support and work with families to increase the effectiveness of home learning environments is discussed. <p> Of the more than 39 million young people enrolled in public schools, it has been estimated that some 20 to 30%, or over seven million students, are having difficulty acquiring academic skills and making adequate school adjustment( Will, 1986). During the past 2 decades, there has been a proliferation of legislation and federally funded " special, " " compensatory, " and " remedial " education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to thrive from usual educational practice. Along with these developments has been the generation of a substantial body of research on effective teaching and the instructional practices that best facilitate the acquisition of academic skills by students with different learning characteristics( Brophy &; Good, 1986 ; Rosenshine &; Stevens, 1986). There has been a recognition that academic achievement is determined by a range of variables, including student characteristics, the instructional environment, home and family factors, and the relationships among these single domains. Accordingly, research and assessment practices have become more ecological in perspective and more responsive to the complex interaction of factors within a student 's total learning environment as determinants of academic achievement( Christenson, Abery, &; Weinberg, 1986 ; Christenson &; Ysseldyke, 1989). <p> From the middle 1960s, research has shown that the school performance of children is strongly influenced by their home background, which traditionally has been defined in terms of global social status variables( e.g., parental income, education, occupation) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order). Although the relationship of school performance to global social status variables and family structural characteristics is one of the most robust in social science research( Coleman, 1966), it has not been particularly useful for educational policy development( Bensen, 1980) or for the development of strategies that families might use to support or facilitate the educational development of their children. <p> The trend in environmental research has been away from crude measures of socioeconomic variables and global IQ toward more subtle intra-family and interpersonal process variables and more specific child outcomes. Wolf( 1964) examined 13 process variables in three categories( press for achievement motivation, press for language development, and provision for general learning) and concluded that family process variables accounted for 50% of the variance in children 's IQs. In subsequent research, Marjoribanks( 1979) examined relationships between children 's intellectual abilities and the social-psychological characteristics of the home environment, including degree of press for achievement, activeness, intellectuality, independence, and language stimulation. He concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mental ability scores than are gross, structural indicators such as family size, socioeconomic status, and birth order. <p> Consistent with the shift in focus toward more psychosocial, process aspects of home and family life as correlates of children 's school performance, researchers have focused on those variables that are potentially manipulable by families and school personnel. The positive effects of parental support for their children 's academic success( e.g., encouraging schoolwork, listening to children read, participating in learning activities at home, providing rewards for improvements on daily in-class assignments, providing opportunity and supplies for learning at home) on children 's academic achievement have been documented in several studies( Epstein, 1988a ; Tizard, Schofield, &; Hewison, 1982 ; Witt, Hannafin, &; Martens, 1983). <p> Considerable empirical evidence exists to support the idea that the interrelated environments of the family and school have an impact on the development of the child. The importance of the family 's influence in academic, behavioral, and emotional problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of home problems on school learning( Esterson, Feldman, &; Krigsman, 1976), and the identification of a school problem as relevant to the home situation and vice versa( Green &; Fine, 1980) have been studied. on the other hand, it has been suggested that school-related crises( e.g., a child being labeled as a handicapped learner) may adversely affect the family system( Rist &; Harrell, 1982 ; Turnbull &; Turnbull, 1978). Samuels( 1986) has described conditions in a child 's learning environment that place the child at risk for academic failure ; among these are characteristics of the home environment, such as degree of support for school efforts and the moral standards and values fostered by family members. Student achievement is higher when the mesosystem of home and school is collaborative( Bronfenbrenner, 1979), family and school rules are congruent( Hansen, 1986), parents are involved in the educational life of their children( Henderson, 1988), and the authoritative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). A framework for describing critical parallel home and school structures that promote student achievement and motivation has been developed by Epstein( 1987). <p> There is a growing body of research on familial patterns associated with learning and behavior problems. Much of this work has involved comparisons of families of educationally handicapped and normal learners, and has focused on both structural and psychosocial process variables. For example, the family structural variable of paternal absence is associated with children 's learning difficulties( Shine, 1978). Educationally handicapped children have been found to live in less well-organized and less emotionally stable families than academically successful children( Owen, Adams, Forest, Stolz, &; Fisher, 1971). Ackerman, Elardo, and Dykman( 1979) found that parents of both learning disabled and hyperactive children expected less achievement from their children than did parents of normal children. <p> Libitz and Johnson( 1975) compared referred and nonreferred children and their families. Based on home observations, they found that referred children showed significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their parents emitted more negative and commanding behavior than parents of nonreferred children. Parental attitudes were dramatically different for the two groups, leading the authors to conclude that child behavior is not the only variable in referral and that assessment procedures for child and family are necessary. Patterson( 1982) identified characteristics of family interaction that contribute to the development of aggressiveness in children, and Walker, Reaves, Rhode, and Jenson( 1985) argued that parental involvement is essential for preparing emotionally disturbed/behaviorally disordered youth for transition to less restrictive educational programs. <p> The importance of home/family influence on student achievement and performance in school should not be underestimated. Individuals have recommended that information about home influences and environments be collected during assessment( Anderson, 1983 ; Lombard, 1979), family and school resources be coordinated to promote student learning( Conoley, 1987a ; Tucker &; Dyson, 1976), and educators working with handicapped children be sensitive to specific issues of family functioning( Turnbull &; Turnbull, 1986). <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture, that several family variables have been identified as important correlates of academic and behavioral performance, and that little data are available on home influences for students with different handicaps, the purpose of this study was to examine specific, educationally relevant aspects of the home environments of students with mild handicaps, and to determine whether these home environmental influences differ from those of nonhandicapped students. The primary question addressed in this research was, " To what extent are there differences in home environments for different categories of mildly handicapped students and nonhandicapped students? " METHOD Subjects <p> This study was conducted during the second year of an investigation of factors contributing to the academic engaged time of students with mild handicaps. During the first year, differences in the quantitative and qualitative nature of academic instruction were examined for students in 11 elementary schools in one urban and one suburban school district who were classified as learning disabled -- LD( n = 30), emotionally/behaviorally disturbed -- EBD( n = 32), educable mentally retarded -- EMR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n = 30). During the second year, alternative explanations for students ' academic performance were examined ; in particular, differences in other school-related influences( e.g., home, teacher) were investigated for a subsample of the original 122 students. <p> The 92 students with handicaps in the original sample were randomly selected from special education teachers ' caseloads. In the participating districts, LD students were identified by either an ability-achievement discrepancy or a greater than 2-year below grade achievement score using curriculum-based measures and local norms. EBD students were described as students who have chronic task incompletion problems, acting out, behavior difficulties, or social interaction difficulties severe enough to impede academic performance. EMR students were described as students who are functionally academically retarded in all four basic skill areas ; these students received their basic skill instruction within special education settings. Nonhandicapped students were considered " average ; " these students received no extra service, such as tutoring, Chapter I, or enrichment. <p> Subjects for the home environment study were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n = 20), EBD( n = 17), EMR( n = 17), and NH( n = 14). They were a subsample of the 122 students who participated in the alternative explanations phase of the research. Only those students who displayed comparable rates of academic engaged time, but statistically significant reading or math achievement differences with a same category peer, were included in the alternative explanations phase. Eighty-one subjects met the established criteria, eight parents did not want to participate, and five subjects were eliminated from data analyses because of missing social status information. <p> Information about participating students is provided in Table 1. Percentages of males and females within student categories were similar except for the EBD group, which had a higher percentage of males. For all groups, the majority of the subjects were nonminority ; the nonhandicapped group had the smallest percentage of minority students. Minority students were classified as Black, Asian, Native American, or other( i.e., undetermined minority race/ethnicity) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly consistent across categories ; the LD and EMR groups each had one student in grade 2. The mean age for all subjects was 119 months ; the range was from 98 to 130 months. The EMR students were slightly older than the LD and EBD students. <p> The four factor index of social status developed by Hollingshead( 1975) was used to determine the socioeconomic status of subjects ' families. For all groups, the majority were classified as middle or upper class. Each category of handicap was represented within the lower socioeconomic level, with the EMR group having the highest percentage of low SES families. No nonhandicapped students were in the low SES bracket. The majority of students in the LD and NH groups lived with both parents, whereas most of the students in the EBD group lived in single parent homes. Four children lived in a separate residence( e.g., with grandparents). The majority of children in all groups had 1 to 2 siblings. Families of LD children tended to be somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children. Most of the students in all groups had attended between 2 and 3 different schools, with the EMR students having had the greatest number of school changes. The average number of total moves for all handicap groups was greater than the average for the nonhandicapped group. overall there were fewer moves for all students the year before the home interview. Measures <p> The Home Rating Scale( HRS), developed from a literature review on family factors correlated with successful school performance, and from modification of interviews developed by Marjoribanks( 1979), Egeland( personal communication, 1985) and Garmezy( personal communication, 1985), was used to obtain information on educationally relevant aspects of students ' home environments. A semi-structured home interview, which was comprised of 27 questions, provided information in three broad areas : weekly routine and use of out of school time, homework practices and family attitude toward the child 's education, and the nature and extent of stressful events or changes in the family. Examples of interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the interview was used to rate nine home factors on the HRS. Home factors, which are described in Table 3, were rated on a 4-point Likert scale, with " 1 " indicating " not at all like the child 's home environment, " " 2 " indicating " not like the child 's home environment, " " 3 " indicating " like the child 's home environment, " and " 4 " indicating " very much like the child 's home environment. " Ratings were obtained on the extent to which the child 's home was characterized by( a) predictable routine,( b) a safe, orderly, physical environment,( c) lack of stress,( d) adequate security,( e) opportunities for the child to develop responsibility,( f) realistic parental expectations,( g) valuing of education by family members,( h) support for completion of academic work, and( i) support for school policies. Alpha reliability coefficient for the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency for the nine home ratings. Procedures <p> Permission for home interviews was obtained from parents by written correspondence and follow-up phone calls. Parents were told that the purpose of the interview was to understand their perceptions of education and to obtain their perspective about their child 's school performance. Four advanced graduate students conducted the interviews in the subjects ' homes ; interviews lasted approximately 1 hour for all groups( range = 20-105 min). Graduate students were not informed of the students ' classification, nor did they know the purpose of the study. In some interviews, reference to the students ' special education services or classification was made. Parents were paid $15 for their participation in the interview. For all groups, the child 's mother was interviewed most often ; for three children in each group both parents were interviewed. The guardian( i.e., grandmother) of one student in the EMR group was interviewed. The nine home factors were rated immediately after the home interview. <p> Training for the home interviews was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had developed the interview. Interviews were conducted in a conversational, comfortable fashion. The trainer conducted the home interview while the trainee observed ; following the interview, ratings were completed independently and compared. The trainee conducted a second home interview while the trainer observed, and independent home ratings were completed and compared. Training continued until both members of the pair were confident that the trainee was ready to interview independently and inter-rater agreement met a minimal predetermined standard. Interrater agreement was calculated in two ways : adjacent category and exact agreement. For adjacent category agreement, ratings of " 1 " and " 2 " and ratings of " 3 and " 4 " were combined. The minimal predetermined standard for adjacent category agreement between the two interviewers was 7 out of 9 items, or 78%. Exact agreement occurred when both interviewers coded the exact same rating on the 4-point scale. The predetermined standard for exact agreement was 6 out of 9 items, or 67%. After trainees ' competence had been established, they trained two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average interrater adjacent category agreement was 91.3% ; average exact agreement was 70.6%. Data Analysis <p> Due to the reliability of the Home Rating Scale( r =.85), ratings for the nine home factors were summed and divided by nine to yield a home score for each student. Two demographic characteristics, parental absence and socioeconomic status( SES), were not evenly distributed for this school-identified sample of students, particularly for students classified as EMR and EBD. Hollingshead 's four factor index of social status was used to control for the confounding effect of SES level ; one of the factors used to describe SES with this index is number of parents in the home. Analysis of covariance( ANCOVA) on the home score by student category( LD, EBD, EMR, NH) with SES as the covariate was conducted. Bonferroni procedures were used to run the ANCOVA follow-up tests. A.01 level of significance was adopted for all analyses. RESULTS <p> Controlling for pre-existing differences in SES level for this school-identified sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To what extent are there differences in home environments for different categories of mildly handicapped students and nonhandicapped students? " The assumptions for conducting analysis of covariance( ANCOVA) on the home score by category with SES as the covariate were met. First, homogeneity of slopes was tested using multivariate analysis of variance( MANCOVA), and found to be nonsignificant, F(3,67) =.87, p =.464. The slopes for the home ratings for SES level and student category were homogeneous. Second, there was a significant difference on the home score for the four categories prior to adjusting for the covariate( SES), F(3,67) = 5.23, p <.003. Third, the covariate( SES) was significantly different for the four student groups, F(3,67) = 4.453, p <.007. <p> The unadjusted and adjusted home scores, on the average, for each student category are presented in Table 4. The home scores were lowest for EBD students and highest for NH and LD students. The results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling for the effect of SES level, f(3,67) = 4.468, p <.007. <p> Results of the follow-up tests are presented in Table 5. of six pairwise comparisons, two significant differences among student groups were found. The home score for LD students was significantly higher than the home score for EBD students, t(1,16) = 3.03, p <.01. And, the home score for NH students was significantly higher than the home score for EBD students, t(1,16) = 3.03, p <.01. There were no differences on the home score for the comparisons between LD and EMR students, LD and NH students, EBD and EMR students, and EMR and NH students. DISCUSSION <p> The purpose of this study was to describe differences in educationally relevant aspects of home environments for three groups of elementary students with handicaps, and to compare home environments of students with handicaps to students without handicaps. Categorical differences emerged in the total home score on the Home Rating Scale after controlling for pre-existing effects due to socioeconomic status of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings, two differences, one involving two handicapped groups, the other involving a handicapped group and the nonhandicapped group, were found. The home score was significantly higher for LD students than for EBD students, and for NH students than for EBD students. Differences in home environments were found only for EBD students, where the home environment was rated lower than the home environment for LD and NH students. No differences were found in home environments for EMR students when compared to home environments for LD, EBD, or NH students. In addition, no differences were found in the home environments of LD students compared to the home environments of NH students. Based on these findings, it seems possible to conclude that a critical factor in discussing differences in the home environments of students with handicaps in comparison to their nonhandicapped peers is type of handicap condition. Home ratings for LD and NH students not only were significantly higher than home ratings for EBD students, but were not significantly different from each other. Findings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985) about the importance of working with parents of EBD students. <p> Although some categorical differences in home ratings were found, recognize that the home scores, on the average, for all student groups were characteristic of the rating " like the student 's home environment. " This would seem to indicate that home environments for all students, regardless of categorical designation, are characterized by some( not all) aspects that are conducive to fostering student performance in school. Previous research has indicated that all parents, regardless of educational or SES levels, want their children to be successful in school, but do not necessarily know how to help their children with school work or how to create a positive attitude toward learning( Epstein, 1983, in press). Furthermore, there is ample evidence that parents wait to be directed by educators( Epstein, 1986). The findings of this study support school psychologists working with parents to increase the educational competence of students, a role advocated by others( Anderson, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombard, 1979). The logical nature and importance of working with parents is stated cogently by Conoley( 1989) in her description of the kind of school psychologist needed to implement prevention programs. She states, " This psychologist is an expert about children : who they are, where they live, what they need, and what can go wrong. He or she is a family and school systems expert because to fail to know families and schools is to fail to know children "( 1989, p. 556). <p> Potential misuse and abuse of the finding of higher home scores for LD and NH students than for EBD students warrants examination. The lower home ratings for EBD students found in this study confirm many practitioners ' clinical and daily experience with parents of EBD students. Homes of some EBD students are described informally by educators as chaotic, dysfunctional, coercive, pathological, or unsupportive of school efforts. Use of findings from this study to identify home environments as the source of students ' problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any interpretation of the family as the cause of students ' classification or problems in school is unwarranted. This was a descriptive study, and an accurate interpretation of the data requires the qualification that home ratings for both handicapped and nonhandicapped students were rated fairly good( not excellent) on many variables shown to promote educational success at school, and the finding that home ratings for EBD students were significantly lower than those for LD and NH students. An appropriate interpretation is that improvement in creating positive home learning environments for students can be made, and the greatest amount of improvement may be needed for EBD students. <p> Another misinterpretation of these data would be that school problems create family stress, resulting in less overall support for the school 's efforts and emphasis on learning in the home. While this may be the case, the current study did not address directional influences between home and school. It is impossible to tease out from these data whether the home environment is causing students ' learning or behavior problems at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are causing the family to respond differently about schooling variables at home. Most importantly, searching for causes leads to pointing the " finger of blame, " a point Seeley( 1985) has discussed articulately in his discussion of the effect of home or school factors on student learning outcomes. He contends that researchers too often treat school and home factors as if they were independent. He states, " this has obscured what successful educators have always known and what sensitive analysis again confirms : the crucial issue in successful learning is not home or school -- teacher or student -- but the relationship between them. Learning takes place where there is a productive learning relationship "( 1985, p. 11). <p> The additional pressures and demands that a child with poor school performance places upon a family need to be acknowledged by educators. In their article, " The Home Environment in the Assessment of Learning Disabilities, " Freund, Bradley, and Caldwell( 1979) discussed in detail reciprocal influences and the direction of effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home environments of learning disabled children is a reaction to, as well as a determinant of, the children 's behavior "( p. 48) points to the need for psychologists to increase the sensitivity of educators to stressors associated with raising a child who is identified by the school as handicapped. In this sample, many single mothers were raising boys who had been classified as EBD. An important issue is whether home environmental influences for EBD students could be changed by establishing the kind of productive home-school relationship Seeley( 1985) described. <p> Perhaps the most important implication for school psychology practice that can be drawn from the findings of this investigation is the need to support and work with families to increase the effectiveness of home learning environments. The Home Rating Scale used in this study measured qualitative aspects of the home environment that have been shown to influence school performance. Using this rating scale, differences in home environments, independent of SES level, were found. Most areas measured were considered " alterable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation with parents. Resources are available to assist school psychologists in working with families to create supportive home learning environments. A model for empowering families to resolve concerns( Dunst, Trivette, &; Deal, 1988), reviews of parent involvement strategies, approaches and programs( Conoley, 1987a ; Epstein, 1988b ; Henderson, 1988 ; National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education ; Rich, 1988), and counseling approaches( Carlson, 1987 ; Conoley, 1987b ; Fewell &; Vadasy, 1986 ; Valentine, 1988) are examples of some resources. <p> There was much talk about educational restructuring in the past decade, a trend expected to continue during the 90s. A necessary( but not sufficient) part of the restructuring is to work with parents so they are partners in the educational process for their children. Restructuring means action, not description. Without action, problems may persist and become more resistant to change( Amatea &; Sherrard, 1989 ; Molnar, 1986). Many parents need information and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role to teach parents about the process of schooling, learning, and development, and to provide a nontraditional form of parent education, that is, information about ways to increase students ' success in school. Without consultation and support to parents about ways to increase the effectiveness of the home learning environment, one could argue that home environments contribute to differentiating students who are less successful from students who are more successful. <p> Due to the inclusion of school-identified students with handicaps and the small sample size, the generalizability of findings from this investigation is limited. This research was conducted as part of a broader investigation using school-identified handicapped students. Specific descriptors for students classified as LD, EBD, EMR, and NH were provided so that readers could address any differences in categorical determination of students served in their districts. The sample size for this exploratory study was respectable, but small. Additional research is needed to confirm categorical differences in students ' home environments and to understand how differences in students ' home environments influence school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a supportive home learning environment on student achievement( Henderson, 1988) and young adults ' educational and occupational attainments( Marjoribanks, 1988) lends credence to school psychologists working with parents of all children, especially parents whose children are handicapped.
