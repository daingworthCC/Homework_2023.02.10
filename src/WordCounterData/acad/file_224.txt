4157641 STEM Education # Co-Teaching in Science and Mathematics # Co-teaching is an increasingly used inclusive practice implemented by administrators to provide effective instruction in classrooms that have students with diverse learning needs. Co-teaching has several different models ; of these, " station teaching " can provide a meaningful way for general educators and special educators to work collaboratively in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics( STEM) inclusive classroom. # The accountability standards in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Individuals with Disability Education Act set the stage for more students with special needs to be included in general education mathematics and science classrooms. Because general education teachers in these classrooms often may have limited experience or professional development to prepare them to teach a diverse group of students including those with special needs, it is both logical and practical to add a special education teacher to the classroom to meet students ' diverse learning needs. Increasing the achievement of all students should be the ultimate goal of bringing two educators with unique skill sets into the co-teaching relationship( Dieker, 2001). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, their roles are often undefined, leading to confusion. Scantlebury, Gallo-Fox, and Wassell( 2007) stressed that starting a dialogue of co-teaching responsibilities is necessary to develop deep collaborative skills focused on student learning. This type of synergistic relationship is needed in all classes, but can be harder to develop in mathematics and science classrooms if there are gaps between the preparation and knowledge base of the two teachers. " Station teaching, " one model of co-teaching, can be useful in creating a successful co-teaching partnership in the secondary science and mathematics classroom. Co-teachers can utilize station teaching in mathematics and science to ensure strong academic outcomes for the wide range of learners in today 's classrooms. # Station Teaching # Station teaching provides co-teachers with both time and a method to successfully instruct smaller groups of students in the use of tools and content in any subject area, but is particularly well suited to mathematics and science. By using stations, both teachers are able to infuse best practices, targeted supports, and ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into instruction. For example, teachers can use content enhancement routines( see University of Kansas Center for Research on Learning, 2012) that support the use of direct instruction to teach key vocabulary in learning mathematics and science, along with research-based tools such as the Vocabulary LINCing Routine( Ellis, 2000). This enables students to grow the content-area vocabulary needed for rich dialogue involving mathematics and science content. Station teaching also can be used to differentiate high-quality Tier 1 instruction within a response-to-intervention model( see RTI Action Network, 2011). Quality Tier 1 instruction includes the use of tools such as graphic organizers, concept maps, scaffolding, and memory devices. These tools can be used in mathematics and science stations to help increase memory and engagement while constructing the necessary background and content knowledge. # Although station teaching requires joint planning time, teachers can use alternative planning strategies--such as a co-planning book( Dieker, 2006) or computerized planning charts--if joint planning time can not be arranged. Because content is delivered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content into multiple learning activities that occur in the same classroom around similar content foci. Station teaching enables teachers to divide the content and reduces student-to-teacher ratio through the use of small-group instruction while increasing opportunities for student-to-teacher interactions. Student grouping strategies can be homogeneous or heterogeneous based on the content and focus of the stations. # The number of stations may vary depending on the structure of the lesson and needs of the students. A common strategy includes both teachers each leading a station, with an optional third station used for independent student work( Cook &amp; Friend, 2004 ; Welch, 2000). Independent student workstations should include explicit instructions accompanied by teacher monitoring to ensure that learning objectives are met( Cook &amp; Friend, 2004). # Although there is a limited amount of literature directly related to using station teaching as the preferred model for co-taught instruction, many recent research studies conclude that there is a need to utilize various models of co-teaching to increase the effectiveness of the model( Scruggs, Mastropieri, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity for increased interactions between teachers ' and all students, and more differentiated instruction. Co-teaching research studies have identified a lack of station teaching in inclusive STEM classes( Magiera, Smith, Zigmond, &amp; Gebauer 2005 ; Morocco &amp; Aguilar, 2002), even though station teaching provides an opportunity for special educators to individualize instruction and to teach skills and strategies that are necessary for some and beneficial to all. The new Common Core State Standards( see http : //www.corestandards.org/) encourage teachers to focus on skills such as higher order thinking, deep knowledge, substantive conversations, and connections outside the classroom. Station teaching provides a convenient opportunity for co-teachers to design lessons to promote the skills necessary to successfully access the Common Core State Standards. # In mathematics and science classrooms, the critical component of vocabulary instruction often is either dismissed or minimized with a typical flash card approach. Station teaching provides real and relevant opportunities to engage students with content vocabulary. Using vocabulary stations can support developing content area literacy for students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenges with the vocabulary. Although vocabulary knowledge is the strongest predictor of student performance on content-study tasks( Espin &amp; Deno, 1995), students with disabilities who are included in general education classrooms require more support with vocabulary development than has been traditionally offered( Wannarka, 2010). Creating stations to address the key vocabulary in mathematics and science will impact student-learning gains ; while particularly helpful for students with disabilities, this approach benefits all students. # Once all students have a strong understanding of key vocabulary terms, teachers can use supportive dialogue and defense strategies not only in station groups but also in whole class discussions. Having a prepared protocol that allows students to make claims, defend claims, and support the rationale behind those claims in a firm but friendly way will also promote students ' social skills needs. # Co-Teaching Science # Mrs. Smith is a science teacher in her fourth year of teaching. She agreed to co-teach with Mr. Grady, a special education teacher, in an inclusive high school lab-science classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities. The two teachers worked together daily in three sections of co-taught biology and had one 45-minute afternoon planning session each week. They decided to divide content based on the students ' needs and focus on literacy, organization, and social skills. # Once a week, when their school had a shortened professional development day( and the teachers had found that they did not have time to do hands-on science), Mrs. Smith and Mr. Grady implemented what they called " Flip-Flop-Fish, " a station-teaching routine. The station teaching routine minimized the use of typical test-prep materials( e.g., paper-and-pencil or bubble worksheets) and included 15-minute instructional activities to engage and instruct students ; students " flip-flopped " in two groups between the stations, and " fished " for information from classroom materials and Internet resources( see box, " Flip-Flop-Fish Lesson Plan "). # Using stations regularly can create focused conversation, increasing content language use for all students. For teachers it creates ownership of lesson instruction and the belief that their combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In station teaching, both teachers engage students in activities, allowing students to communicate their ideas through positive discourse, researching plausible ideas concerning content-area knowledge, and applying new knowledge in various ways. The sample Flip-Flop-Fish lesson clearly addresses the nature of science and, more important, allows all students to engage in the scientific method while being supported by their co-teachers. # Co-Teaching Mathematics # Co-teaching also can be used effectively in middle school mathematics. Mrs. Williams, a mathematics teacher, and Ms. Jones, a special education teacher, co-taught a class of 30 students with an average of 10 students with disabilities. They utilized three learning stations as a means of providing opportunities for reteaching and independent practice, and to incorporate time for students to learn tips on how to problem solve. The teachers did not share a common planning time, so they utilized a computerized planning chart that they accessed in a shared folder in the school 's network( Google Docs, Dropbox, and Pbwiki are other options for co-teachers to share and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning, the teachers were able to plan for their own stations independently, therefore minimizing the amount of joint planning time necessary for implementation. # Mrs. Williams and Ms. Jones, like Mrs. Smith and Mr. Grady, generally used station teaching on short professional development days. They also used station teaching on days when they wanted to give their students time to complete independent work or guided practice, and in order to provide students with additional small group support. For example, after Mrs. Williams introduced a lesson on solving word problems on Monday, they planned a three-station learning session for Tuesday, to provide opportunities for small group instruction, independent practice, and academic support to help students develop strategies to solve complex word problems. On Monday, as a formative assessment, students completed exit slips( solving one mathematics problem with a written explanation to support their answers). Based on the students ' responses, the teachers grouped them for Tuesday 's class : # * At Station 1, Mrs. Williams reviewed algebraic equations without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Jones provided a think-aloud, presenting the metacognitive strategies students need to use to solve the problems. The goal of this type of activity is to help students use self-talk in order to break down word problems. # * At Station 3, students completed independent work on word problems using a process sheet that mirrored the think-alouds( the metacognitive process) Ms. Jones modeled in Station 2( see box, " Additional Process Supports "). # This type of ongoing three-station structure( see Table 1) allows co-teachers to have a stronger role and voice in the classroom, while at the same time promoting greater learning outcomes for students. As illustrated by the table, there are benefits and challenges to both the traditional and Station Teaching classroom configurations. When working in a co-teaching setting consider classroom configuration as it impacts the students in your class. # Stations can be used in any order, as they are all related and provide students the opportunity to review, practice, and receive tips on how to decode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the group that needs the most support begin in Station 1, where the general education teacher can review or reteach the previous day 's content. Students whose exit slips reveal them needing the most assistance would sequentially rotate through Stations 2 and 3. In contrast, students whose exit slips indicate that they need little support might start at Station 3 and work backwards. The mathematics teacher can customize the support provided in Station 1 to the needs of each group of students. This station teaching method can provide students the feedback and positive coaching that is needed for academic progress. # Co-teachers can use their strengths to differentiate instruction to help students gain mathematics knowledge independently and through direct instruction in small groups. Once this structure is in place, planning time each week is dramatically reduced. # Impacts of Station Teaching # Benefits for Students # When creating stations, it 's important to keep in mind students ' individualized education program( IEP) goals. Stations can focus on reading, writing, or social skills depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing support for a wide range of skills for all students. Station teaching gives teachers flexibility to vary interactions( e.g., teacher-student, student-student, student-hands-on materials). Students who benefit from concrete examples can participate in a station learning activity with concrete materials prior to moving on to more abstract concepts. Moving students through the stations by placing them in stations that support their academic weaknesses minimizes the frustration that students often experience and can reduce behavior problems. Small-group instruction in station teaching encourages all students to take learning risks, defend their answers when grappling with challenging content, and ask questions that support the development of metacognitive thought processes. The teacher is always available to monitor, coach, and support students as their skills grow in the content area. # Benefits for Science and Mathematics Instruction # A word that gets every teacher 's attention is time. When planning time is short and different teaching styles are merged or new teams created, station teaching is a great way to start. The independence of the station method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal conflict, using their unique skills to benefit students. Over time, as the relationship grows to one of synergy or time allows more planning, other co-teaching models can be integrated into the co-teaching plan. It is important that both teachers have a clear understanding of the curriculum map, and what each bring in skills into the co-taught classroom. In mathematics and science, often both teachers are not at the same level with the content or with working with students with disabilities. Each teacher brings something different to each station( e.g., literacy vs. advanced science/mathematics knowledge). # Figure 1 illustrates how station teaching can combine mathematics and science content instruction, incorporating technology. Using a station teaching model permits grouping students in a variety of ways, enabling teachers to address learning across a range of content areas. This type of station teaching could even be used by three teachers( i.e., a mathematics teacher, science teacher, and special education teacher) in a synergistic model that provides instruction across content areas while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murawski( 2012) noted that the greatest concerns about co-teaching include time to plan and mixing personalities. The station teaching model provides an opportunity for professionals across content areas to work in the same environment and utilizes their different talents to increase learning outcomes for all students. Unlike the one lead-one support model, where the special educator is sometimes perceived as taking a role more like that of an aide or paraeducator, station teaching can truly utilize both teachers ' expertise. Within station teaching, each educator is able to isolate key content and instruct students within small groups, with an overall goal of impacting student learning. By using station teaching, teachers can deliver mathematics and science content in small doses in each station, monitoring small groups of students to ensure learning mastery. Stations allow teachers to preteach, reteach, and explore content in isolated chunks. There is enough content within mathematics and science curriculums for both teachers to find something meaningful to teach in small 15- to 20-minute lessons. # Implementing Station Teaching in Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching for the first time, we recommend that you consider the 2 x 2 format( two stations led by each of the two co-teachers) before using a 3 x 2 setup( three stations, with each teacher leading a station and one station for independently engaged activity). By beginning with the 2 x 2 strategy, both the general education teacher and the special education teacher can focus on guiding an activity with two separate groups in the classroom and are not distracted by the independent student group. After you have completed the 2 x 2 model successfully, consider moving to a 3 x 2. This structure supports two small groups with one independent group working alone with technology or some sort of cooperative learning group where teacher support is not expected. # Table 2 provides our " top 10 " principles for general and special educators when leading mathematics and science stations. These ideas are easy to integrate, incorporate strategies that specifically meet the needs of students with disabilities, and will increase your success in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support structure when creating a third or even fourth station in your classroom( see box, " Technology Resources for Station Teaching "). Moving students into a third or fourth station creates an even further reduced student-to-teacher ratio and allows for greater remediation, enrichment, and, of course--the bottom line--increasing student learning gains. # Final Thoughts # Co-teaching offers the opportunity for teachers to collaborate and provide instruction to diverse learners in inclusive settings. The station teaching model is an effective way to teach secondary science and mathematics content while increasing student learning gains. Station teaching can promote the use of technology and communication while decreasing student-to-teacher ratios and allowing for more direct support and small-group instruction. This is a win-win situation for students and teachers alike. With more and more states moving to end-of-the-course exams in science and mathematics, ensuring the mastery of content and utilizing the strength of both general and special education teachers is critical. Developing and maintaining an effective co-teaching partnership using station teaching to provide instruction on a regular basis will help ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to students with disabilities. # Flip-Flop-Fish Station Teaching Lesson Plan # Mrs. Jones and Mr. Grady developed a crime scene investigation-themed lesson to teach students about blood typing and analysis. In this lesson, students are divided into two groups, identified as " detectives " or " doctors " ; each group uses the same blood samples and has a station-specific worksheet to complete.( The two groups " flip-flop " after completing each station 's activities.) # * Students starting in Station A( Detectives) receive information about three possible suspects ' blood types, then gather clues from the " crime scene. " The " detectives " must hypothesize who the assailant is and defend their answers based on forensic clues discovered at the scene. # * Students starting in Station B( Doctors) examine blood samples of different " patients, " looking at prepared slides of blood cells and comparing these to classroom resources. The students note characteristics of the blood samples and of diseases of the blood to identify whether their patient samples have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In their assessment, the " doctors " use books, media, posters, and web sites such as the Ohio State University 's Wexner Medical Center 's Hematology and Blood Disorder Glossary( http : **38;58418;TOOLONG... # In both stations, students must defend their answers based on the scientific information gathered in the day 's events. To assist students in understanding the relevant content science vocabulary, the teachers also have a third " vocabulary " station, decorated with pictures and examples, where students can access information( print- and Internet-based) on all science vocabulary used in the activity. # Additional Process Supports # A series of short instructional videos modeling the use of the process sheet could also support students as they learn to use the form during their independent work. Students would view the videos to check their own work ; to watch the process of solving multistep and challenging mathematical problems ; and to use the feedback from the video to review, self-assess, and correct their work. Such videos can be made without editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, corrected in a recorded think-aloud--further demonstrating the power of this important metacognitive method. # Technology Resources for Station Teaching # Internet resources # CAST Science Writer for lab report writing( see http : **32;58458;TOOLONG) # Khan Academy( see http : //www.khanacademy.org/) math and science instructional sets and review assessments # Nobel Peace Prize web site with math and science educational games( see http : **33;58492;TOOLONG) # General tips #?
