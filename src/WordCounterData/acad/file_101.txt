4014841 Section : ORIGINAL ARTICLES <p> Since plasma endothelin concentration increases with upright posture and decreases with volume expansion, a study was conducted to test whether activation of the baroreceptor reflex releases endothelin into plasma. <p> The effect of passive upright tilt on the plasma concentrations of endothelin and vasopressin was examined in :( 1) normal subjects ;( 2) patients with impaired baroreceptor reflex due to primary autonomic failure ;( 3) patients with normal afferent baroreceptor function but acute inhibition of vasoconstrictor sympathetic outflow( ie, with vasovagal syncope) ; and( 4) patients with hypophysial diabetes insipidus. In normal subjects upright tilt did not change arterial pressure and significantly increased the plasma concentrations of endothelin and vasopressin. In patients with autonomic failure, upright tilt induced a considerable fall in arterial pressure, no rise in plasma endothelin, and a slight increase in plasma vasopressin. In subjects with vasovagal syncope, arterial pressure dropped and the plasma concentrations of endothelin and vasopressin rose. In the subjects with diabetes insipidus, arterial pressure fell slightly, without change in plasma concentration of endothelin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induces the release of endothelin into plasma, probably from the neurohypophysis, and they raise the possibility that impaired endothelin release contributes to the orthostatic hypotension of patients with primary autonomic failure. Lancet 1991 ; 338 : 1542-45. <p> Introduction <p> Endothelin-1 is a vasoconstrictor peptide synthesised by endothelial cells( n1) and by neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.( n2) The finding( n3) that in normal subjects plasma concentration of endothelin increased with upright posture and decreased during volume expansion raises the possibility that endothelin is a circulating hormone involved in arterial pressure control. If so, plasma concentration of endothelin-1( referred to as endothelin in this article) would be expected to change with activation of the baroreceptor reflex. To test this hypothesis, we examined the plasma concentration of this peptide before and during upright tilt in normal subjects, in patients with impaired baroreceptor reflex due to primary autonomic failure,( n4) and in patients with vasovagal syncope. <p> Moreover, because endothelin is present in the neurohypophysis and seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine whether the increase in plasma endothelin during upright tilt is of neurohypophysial origin, we measured plasma vasopressin in our subjects and plasma endothelin in patients with diabetes insipidus due to hypothalamic lesions. Methods <p> The four groups of subjects, all free of diabetes mellitus or, by clinical criteria, of cardiovascular disease were : <p> Group I -- 5 normal subjects( 2 males and 3 females, mean age 41 SD 14 years). <p> Group II -- 5 patients( 3 males and 2 females, mean age 56 14 years) with autonomic failure accompanied by central nervous system dysfunction( ie, multiple system atrophy). Criteria for this diagnosis were as previously described.( n4, n5) All subjects had parkinsonism. 1 also had cerebellar and pyramidal deficits. All patients had severe orthostatic hypotension, abnormal blood pressure and heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre, and sphincter disturbances. The 3 men had impotence. <p> Group III -- 7 otherwise healthy subjects( 6 females and 1 male, mean age 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vasovagal episode during upright tilt. The criteria for vasovagal syncope have been described.( n6, n7) <p> Group IV -- 3 patients with diabetes insipidus due to hypothalamic lesions( 1 female with eosinophilic granuloma and 2 males with craniopharyngioma, mean age 47 16 years). Diabetes insipidus was diagnosed by clinical criteria and all patients needed desmopressin( desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) to maintain water balance. <p> Subjects were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center of the Mount Sinai Hospital. The protocol was approved by the hospital 's institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from each subject. None of the normal subjects was taking any drugs. Patients with autonomic failure were asked to discontinue all medication at least 12 days before the study. In patients with diabetes insipidus, the last dose of desmopressin was taken the day before the test. <p> Upright tilt stimulation was done as previously described.( n5) Briefly, at 8 am, after an overnight fast, the patient was transferred to a tilt table with foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer and heart rate was continuously monitored. An intravenous catheter was pieced in the left arm. After 30 min a blood sample was taken( supine value). Immediately thereafter the patient was tilted 60 degrees upright. Blood pressure was taken every 2 min and blood samples were again collected at about 10, 20, and 30 min in the upright position. Patients with hypotension were returned to the horizontal position if they had symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion. <p> Plasma concentration of endothelin was determined by radioimmunoassay employing anti-endothelin-1 antiserum, 125 I-endothelin-1, and endothelin-1 standards( Peninsula Labs, Belmont, California, USA). Blood was collected in chilled polypropylene tubes containing aprotinin and edetic acid. The plasma was divided into portions and stored at -80 Celsius until assayed. Plasma( 2-5ml) was acidified with equal volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid( TFA) and loaded into Sep-Pak C-18 ' cartridges( Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) pre-activated by washing with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid and the eluate was evaporated dry in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. The residue was resuspended in assay buffer( 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton-X 100). Mean recovery through the extraction process was 75%. Standards and samples were incubated at 4 Celcius for 24 h with a 1/26 400 dilution of rabbit anti-endothelin-1 antibody and again incubated at 4 Celcius for 40 h with 125 I-endothelin-1. After 2 h incubation at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG and normal rabbit serum, samples were centrifuged and pellets counted in a gamma counter. Vasopressin was determined by radioimmunoassay.( n8, n9) Noradrenaline was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection after alumina extraction. Plasma renin activity was measured by radioenzymatic assay. Student 's t-test for paired samples was used when appropriate. All data are shown as mean( SE). Results <p> In normal subjects arterial pressure did not change during upright tilt and the plasma concentrations of both endothelin and vasopressin increased significantly, from 0.10( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and from 1.32( 0.23) to 3.37( 0.42) pmol/l for vasopressin ; p < 0.05 for both variables( fig 1). In patients with autonomic failure, arterial pressure fell considerably during upright tilt, from 111( 6) to 66( 6) mm Hg, p < 0.005, but plasma endothelin remained unchanged, at 0.17( 0.04) supine and 0.16( 0.05) pmol/l upright. There was a modest but significant increase in the plasma concentrations of vasopressin during upright tilt in patients with autonomic failure, from 1.02( 0.19) to 2.97( 0.52) pmol/l, p < 0.05. However, as previously shown,( n10) the rise in plasma vasopressin was clearly inappropriate for the fall in blood pressure in these patients. <p> In the subjects with syncope, arterial pressure fell from 86( 4) to 50( 2) mm Hg, p < 0.005, the degree of change being similar to that in patients with autonomic failure. However, unlike patients with autonomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plasma concentration of endothelin from 0.36( 0.07) to 1.12( 0.2) pmol/l, p < 0.005, and a striking increase in plasma vasopressin, from 0.99( 0.17) to 45.88( 21.94) pmol/l, p < 0.05. <p> As expected, upright tilt in normal subjects induced a significant increase in plasma noradrenaline and renin activity( table). In patients with autonomic failure, neither noradrenaline nor renin increased significantly during upright tilt. In subjects with vasovagal syncope, at first plasma noradrenaline increased with upright tilt, as in normal subjects, but it dropped when arterial pressure fell. <p> Because vasopressin and endothelin increased greatly and in parallel as the blood pressure dropped in patients with vasovagal syncope, and because hypotension in these patients is due to acute inhibition of vasoconstrictor sympathetic outflow,( n11, n12) we hypothesised that the endothelin entering plasma during upright tilt originates in the neurohypophysis rather than in the endothelial cells of the systemic circulation. To test this theory directly, we measured plasma endothelin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed from the supine to the upright position -- and found that upright tilt in these patients lowered arterial pressure from 104( 9) to 77( 8) mm Hg but did not increase the plasma concentration of endothelin( 0.33 0.03 supine and 0.37 0.07 pmol/l upright)( fig 2). Discussion <p> Our results suggest that the increase in plasma endothelin induced by change from supine to upright position is mediated by the baroreceptor reflex because the concentration of this peptide increases during upright tilt in normal subjects but not in patients with impaired baroreceptor reflex due to primary autonomic failure. Needless to say, the possibility that patients with autonomic failure clear plasma endothelin more rapidly than do normal individuals can not be excluded from our data. <p> Several lines of evidence suggest that the increase in circulating endothelin induced by orthostasis is due to release of the peptide from the neurohypophysis rather than from endothelial cells in the systemic circulation( see fig 3). First, in normal subjects and in patients with vasovagal syncope, plasma vasopressin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syncope there is inhibition of sympathetic flow to blood vessels( n11, n12) and a decrease in plasma noradrenaline. The afferent and central portions of the baroreceptor reflex arc, however, function normally during syncope, and vasopressin is secreted.( n10, n13) This finding suggests that, in patients with vasovagal syncope, the afferent connections of the baroreceptor reflex that induced vasopressin release also stimulated endothelin release from the neurohypophysis. Finally, because endothelin is synthesised in paraventricular nuclear neurons and it is stored in the posterior pituitary,( n2) the observation that patients with diabetes insipidus did not release endothelin during upright tilt suggests that the neurohypophysis of these patients is depleted of endothelin as well as of vasopressin. <p> It is unlikely that the increase in plasma endothelin during upright tilt is due to endothelin release from endothelial cells by local haemodynamic factors such as changes in shear stress or pressure.( n14) One would expect that these factors would have also released endothelin in patients with diabetes insipidus or in patients with autonomic failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during change from supine to upright position increases plasma endothelin by secretion of the peptide from the neurohypophysis. Supporting this conclusion is the finding that in rats water deprivation depletes the neurophypophysis of endothelin as well as of vasopressin.( n2) <p> In a study with endothelial cells in culture, Emori et al( n15) found that angiotensin II, vasopressin, calcium ionophore, and protein kinase C activation increased the amount of endothelin released. This raises the possibility that either angiotensin II or vasopressin, or both, could stimulate endothelin release from endothelial cells during upright tilt. Although this possibility can not be excluded, Emori et al( n15) had to use vasopressin and angiotensin at the nanomolar range to induce endothelin release, whereas these peptides circulate in plasma at picomolar concentrations during upright tilt.( n16) <p> Because specific inhibitors of endothelin action are not yet available, the physiological function of the endothelin released into plasma during baroreceptor activation remains to be defined. Plasma endothelin may contribute to the vasoconstriction that maintains blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endothelin secreted by the neurohypophysis, like vasopressin, has a systemic vasoconstrictor action as well as specific effects on renal excretory function.( n17, n18) Whether the lack of increase in plasma endothelin in patients with autonomic failure contributes to their orthostatic hypotension remains to be defined. <p> This work was supported m part by NS-07245 from NINDS and RR-71 from the Division of Research Resources of the NIH.
