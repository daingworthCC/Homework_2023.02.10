4156441 What do a mouse, an angry girl, and a terrible monster have in common? They 're all characters intentionally illustrated to provide ways for children to interpret literature for literary understanding # " Alice? having nothing to do? peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ' and what use is a book, ' thought Alice, ' without pictures or conversations? ' "( Carroll, 1865, p. 11). # It is likely Alice would be even more enamored with pictures if she encountered contemporary fictional picture books in which illustrations so often play a critical role in developing literary elements -- those building blocks of fiction that enable readers to understand, interpret, and respond to literature. Literary elements such as setting, plot, and character are intertwined and all make significant contributions to a reader 's understanding and interpretations of stories( Lukens &amp; Cline, 1995). # However, we believe that character may be particularly critical to literary meaning making, and in this article we explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the characters they meet in fictional picture books and how teachers can help children learn to more fully use this pictorial information. # Characters and Character Development # Characters are important to readers for many reasons. First, characters " enlist readers, hold their interests, unravel plots, and affect lives "( Martinez &amp; Roser, 2005, p. vi). Kiefer( 2010) observed that characterization in children 's literature is so important that even " long after we have forgotten the names "( p. 18) of picture books from our childhood, we often still recall the names and personalities of many characters because " they came alive in the pages of books, and will forever live in our memories "( p. 19). # However, characters do more than draw readers in and entice them. Characters have been described as the driving force of stories( Cullinan &amp; Galda, 1998), and Emery( 1996) argued, " character states, such as their desires, feelings, thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story together "( p. 534). # These arguments suggest that character understanding may be crucial to readers ' literary meaning making, especially in light of the interconnections that exist among character intentions, conflicts, and thematic understanding( Golden &amp; Guthrie, 1986). In fact, in her study of children 's understanding of literary theme, Lehr( 1991) found that children who discussed character motivation were better able to talk about the central theme of the stories they read. Therefore, understanding characters may serve as an important pathway to deeper levels of meaning. # Character Development Through Illustrations # Characterization in stories -- including picture books -- can be complex, encompassing character traits, motivations and goals, feelings, and relationships. In stories without illustrations, we know that readers learn about a character through what the character says and does, through what others say about the character, and through what the narrator reveals. However, how do these different facets of character emerge in picture books? # The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stories are told through the interplay of pictures and text( Arizpe &amp; Styles, 2003 ; Nodelman, 1988 ; Schwarcz &amp; Schwarcz, 1991 ; Sipe, 2008a). It is because of this interplay that picture books have been described as stories told twice, " once through the text and once through illustration "( Agosto, 1999, p. 267). # Given the significant contributions of both illustrations and written words in picture books, readers must thoughtfully attend to both sign systems -- the visual as well as the verbal -- to deeply understand the characters. However, Sipe( 2008a) argued that reading visual images is not something children do automatically ; rather it is something that must be learned. Thus readers need to develop insights into the principles of visual art, including understandings of the commonly held meanings conveyed by color, line, shape, and texture( Sipe, 2008a). # For example, when children encounter the extensive use of red in story illustrations, if they are familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive anger, danger, or love depending on the context of the color 's use in the illustration. Also, when children are taught to understand artistic conventions such as perspective, size, position on the page, and the use of frames, they are better able to interpret illustrators ' uses of these devices when they encounter them in the artwork in picture books( Moebius, 1986). # Although these principles and conventions come into play as illustrators work to craft the various elements of stories including character, there is not complete agreement on how characters are revealed in picture books. In their discussion of characterization, Nikolajeva and Scott( 2001) maintained that the illustrations in picture books lend themselves to developing external facets of character such as appearance, gender, and age, whereas internal facets of character are more likely to emerge through the author 's words. Nonetheless, these scholars do concede that some facets of inner character can be revealed through illustrations by means of character " poses, gestures, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( p. 82). # Deliberate Attention to Visual Possibilities # However, illustrations in picture books may contribute far more to character development than what Nikolajeva and Scott( 2001) suggested. In their analysis of the development of literary elements in picture books, Martinez and Harmon( in press) found that visual information in picture books for younger children played a dominant role in the development of character traits, interests, and emotions. Moebius( 1986) and Nodelman( 1988) also described ways that illustrators convey meaning about character, including through the use of color and the positioning of characters on the page. # Given the potential importance of illustrations in character development, young children reading( or listening to) picture books must attend not only to the words of stories, but also to visual information if they are to understand the characters they meet in picture books. In his investigations of young children 's meaning making during storytime, Sipe( Sipe, 2008a ; Sipe &amp; Brightman, 2005 ; Sipe &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the feelings, thoughts, and motivations of the characters they met in stories, and illustrations were a rich source of information the children used in making these character inferences. Sipe also reported on some of the visual conventions the children relied on as they worked to understand characters, including the use of color to convey emotion and line to convey character movement. # However, illustrators use a variety of devices to bring their characters to life, and given the importance of picture book illustrations in developing characters, we wanted to gain greater insight into the kinds of visual information that young children draw on in their attempts to understand characters. Therefore, we undertook an investigation in a second-grade classroom to address the following question : What kinds of pictorial information do young children use to gain insights into the characters they meet in picture books? # What We Did # The second-grade classroom in which we observed is located in an elementary school in rural South Texas that primarily serves white( 49%) and Hispanic( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys and 8 girls, in the class in which we conducted our study. # Because we wanted to know what kinds of visual information children use to understand characters, we selected three picture books with particularly rich characterization for the teacher to read aloud to her students -- When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really, Really Angry by Molly Bang( 1999), Leonardo the Terrible Monster by Mo Willems( 2005), and Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse by Kevin Henkes( 1996). Table 1 contains summaries of the three books. The classroom teacher indicated that she had never read the three books to her students. # For each of the three stories, we selected three illustrations to use in talking with the children. We chose each illustration with an eye toward ensuring that the children would have the opportunity to talk about pictures in which illustrators used a variety of visual elements and conventions to develop characters. # In Table 2, we describe the illustrations the children were asked to talk about and identify devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Because the pages in the books are not numbered, we identify the pages to which the children responded by referring to openings, using Sipe 's( 2008a) definition of the term in which the " first opening is the two pages where the text of the book begins and the openings are numbered after this "( p. 256). # Over the course of three weeks, two of us( Lori and Angeli) visited the second-grade classroom once a week during story time. On each visit we observed as the teacher read aloud and talked with her students about one of the stories. During story time the teacher invited the students to sit on the floor in front of her as she read. # The teacher ensured that each student could see the illustrations in the book, and she even asked students to move closer when she thought they might not be able to see the pictures. When there were relatively few words on a page, the teacher held up the book as she read so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more extended text, the teacher typically would read and then hold up the book so children could see the accompanying illustration. # Story time was an interactive experience in this second-grade classroom. The teacher typically began each story session by talking a bit about the issues in the story. For instance, before reading the When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really, Really Angry, she asked the students to think about what makes them happy and to think about what it feels like when they are angry. # During and after the storybook reading, the teacher asked questions and invited discussions about the book. During the reading, the children were often asked to make predictions about what might happen next in the story. The teacher also posed simple recall questions and encouraged students to make connections between the experiences of story characters and their own personal experiences. However, little if any of the talk during the read-alouds focused on characterization as revealed through illustrations. # The first week we visited the class, the teacher read aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second week, she shared Leonardo the Terrible Monster ; and the third week, she read aloud Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse. As we observed each read-aloud, we audio recorded the talk and took notes so that we could more fully describe the story time interactions. Immediately after each read-aloud, we talked with each student individually in the school library. # During these interviews, we showed each child the pre-selected illustrations from the book one by one and asked, " What do you see in the illustration? " We typically followed up this initial question by asking, " How do you know? " or " What clues help you know that? " Although we were interested in gaining insight into the pictorial information children used to understand the story character, we never specifically asked the children to talk about character. We transcribed the audio recordings of the interviews. # Student Insights Into Character # Even though we did not ask the children specifically about the characters in the stories, this was the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed the illustrations -- illustrations chosen because they featured main characters prominently. The children made a variety of inferences about the characters, including inferences about character feelings, thoughts, and relationships, as well as inferences about changes in characters ' feelings, thoughts, and relationships. # As we looked closely at the children 's responses to determine the kinds of visual information they used to make character inferences, we found that they were particularly attentive to pictorial story content, such as character actions, facial expressions, and body posture, and the way in which characters related to one another. Children also referred to some of the elements of art in supporting character inferences, in particular, the illustrator 's use of color and line. However, we found that the children did not appear to be attuned to many of the visual devices intentionally used by illustrators. In many cases, they typically did not talk about symbols, position of characters, and other visual content that clearly conveyed important information about characters. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview transcripts that reveal the kinds of visual information the children drew on in supporting their inferences about the characters they met in the three books. # Pictorial Content # The second graders we interviewed were all attuned to three types of pictorial content that revealed significant information about characters -- facial expressions, body postures, and characters ' actions. # Facial Expressions. In the book When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really, Really Angry, the facial expressions of the main character conveyed important information about Sophie 's( the main character) feelings. Like most of the children, Emily( all names are pseudonyms) talked about the way in which the illustrator drew Sophie 's eyes, mouth, and eyebrows in opening 6( see Table 2 for descriptions of openings) of the story and understood what this revealed about the character : # Interviewer( Lori) : Tell me about this picture. What do you see happening? # Emily : It shows her about to explode because she 's really mad. Because her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interviewer( Lori) : What is her face showing? # Emily : Madness. # How is it showing madness? # Emily : Her mouth is n't smiling, it 's just straight and her eyebrows are going down. # Action. The children also discussed ways in which a character 's actions yielded insights into the character. For example, in Leonardo the Terrible Monster, Emma, in discussing opening 12, supported her inference about Leonardo by referring to the actions of the character that were revealed pictorially : # Interviewer( Lori) : What 's happening in this picture now? # Emma : He 's Leonardo happy because he scared a little boy and made him cry. # Interviewer( Lori) : Yes? How do you know that? How does the picture give you clues? # Emma : Cause he is going like this! Emma demonstrates pulling her arm in, doing the same " arm tuck " done by Leonardo. # Interviewer( Lori) : Can you describe that? # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it! # Interviewer( Lori) : It does? But how is he doing it? He is holding his hand how? # Emma : In a fist and going like this. Emma demonstrates the action again. # Symbol. Two of the illustrations we used contained symbols that revealed information about characters( see Table 2). Although some of the children talked about these symbols, most did not. In opening 6 of When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really, Really Angry, author and illustrator Molly Bang described Sophie as " a volcano ready to explode " and included an actual volcano in the illustration with the word explode serving as the lava emerging from the volcano. A few of the children, including Caren, talked about the meaning behind this symbol : # Interviewer( Lori) : What do you see in that picture? # Caren : She 's getting really really angry in this picture. # Interviewer( Lori) : How do you know? # Caren : Because there 's a volcano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Lori) : And what does that mean to you? # Caren : It means that she 's really really really angry! # Interviewer( Lori) : So when you see a volcano you think about?. # Caren : Something getting angry and blowing up. # Although most of the children did not appear to understand the significance of these symbols, we believe it is telling that some children used them to better understand story characters. # Pictorial Devices # In justifying their inferences about characters, most students drew on their understanding of two art elements -- color and line. # Color. In talking about When Sophie Gets Angry -- Really, Really Angry, almost all the children talked about the illustrator 's use of color to convey information about the main character 's feelings, in particular, associating the use of red with Sophie 's feelings of anger. Many also talked about how changes in color signaled change in the character 's feelings. They stated that the color red meant Sophie was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to opening 7, Aaron talked about this change in color : # Interviewer( Lori) : Can you tell me what is happening in this picture? # Aaron : This is where she is getting all her madness out and she sits there and is alone and where she kind of like talks to herself and tells herself to calm down because nobody deserves that. # Interviewer( Lori) : You said that here she is calming down. Is there any clue that tells you she is calming down? # Aaron : Cause it use to be red around her and now it 's turning orange. She calmed down and came back home. # Although color was not a major device used to convey character information in Leonardo the Terrible Monster, one student did pick up on a subtle use of color when he observed that the background color of the page was " even darker purple " when the character was feeling sadder. # Line. Most of the children talked about illustrators ' use of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse, which depicts an angry Lilly in one panel with swirling round lines for eyes, Aston had this to say about Lilly 's eyes : # Aston : They 're red and they look mad. # Interviewer( Lori) : What else told you that she 's mad? # Aston : The swirly things. # Although the children justified many of their character inferences by pointing out illustrators ' use of color and line, there were three important pictorial devices that contributed information about characters that most children did not talk about -- the illustrator 's manipulation of size, the position of characters within the illustration, and the breaking of frames that surrounded illustrations. Nonetheless, as the following examples show, a few of the children appeared to understand these devices. # Size. In opening 16 of Leonardo the Terrible Monster, Mo Willems completely filled the double-page spread with a close-up of Leonardo 's thoughtful-looking face. Yet only JoAnn talked about the significance of the size of Leonardo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interviewer( Lori) : What 's happening on this page? # JoAnn : He was making the decision? that he would be his friend. And not scare anybody anymore. # Interviewer( Lori) : You said he was making a decision, what kind of decision? # JoAnn : A big decision. # Interviewer( Lori) : And what gives you a clue that it 's a big decision? # JoAnn : Because of how they drew his face, everything is big! # In opening 9 of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse, Kevin Henkes also uses a change in size to suggest an important character change. In this opening, Lilly is depicted in a series of four panels, and in each panel Lilly is drawn progressively smaller. In responding to this opening, Dallas talked about this change in size : # Interviewer( Lori) : What 's happening in this picture? # Dallas : She is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. # Interviewer( Lori) : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That she is getting sad. # Although JoAnn and Dallas appeared to understand the significance of these size changes, size may be a more subtle artistic device, because few of the other second graders made references to these size changes. # Breaking the Frame. In opening 16 of Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse, Lilly is again portrayed in a series of four panels, and in the fourth panel, a joyful Lilly is seen leaping out of the panel( i.e., breaking the frame). Vickie was one of the few children to talk about the significance of this artistic device : # Interviewer( Lori) : What is happening there? # Vickie : She 's getting happy. She 's smiling and she 's skipping and hopping. # Interviewer( Lori) : How can you tell she 's skipping and hopping? # Vickie : Because those lines make her hop. student pointing to a dotted line showing the pathway of the character 's movement # Interviewer( Lori) : Anything else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopping out of the picture. # Interviewer( Lori) : And what does that tell you? # Vickie : That she 's really happy. # What We Learned # The interview excerpts that we have shared show examples of children using visual information to better understand the characters they meet in stories. However, we also found that the children were not attuned to many types of visual clues embedded in illustrations. This suggests that teachers have important work to do in fostering children 's visual literacy. # The second graders supported their character inferences largely by attending to the facial expressions, body posture, and character actions depicted in illustrations, as well as their understandings of the ways that illustrators use color and line to convey character information. Yet the images we shared with children contained other important visual information that the children either missed or did not talk about. # For instance, in one of the illustrations from Leonardo the Terrible Monster, a dejected Leonardo is positioned in the bottom corner of the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positionality to convey character information. Also, most of the children did not make mention of the symbols illustrators embedded in illustrations or the use of the artistic devices of changing the size of a character and showing a character breaking the frame surrounding an illustration. # We believe that our findings dovetail with the work of others who have explored children 's responses to picture books and suggest that young children are capable of using visual information to understand characters( Sipe, 2008b ; Sipe &amp; Brightman, 2005 ; Sipe &amp; Ghiso, 2005). Children also appear to be aware of the importance of visual information in picture books. At the conclusion of each interview, we asked each child how the illustrations in picture books helped them. Their responses showed they valued images for the information they provided about characters. # For example, Vera responded by saying, " They help me think what 's happening in the story because the motions that they 're doing. " Mike answered, " Cause they show expression. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing and his action, how he 's feeling. They show his mouth and sometimes they put tears by eyes that show that he 's sad. " JoAnn said that pictures " show if something is big or little or the colors tell you something too. " She went on to say, " When Sophie got really really angry, it showed on the body with colors. " # What Teachers Can Do # Teachers have an important role in enriching " their students ' aesthetic appreciation and understanding of the visual features of picture books "( Sipe, 2008b, p. 213). In fact, Sipe( 2008a) described teachers as the " enablers of children 's meaning making from picture books "( p. 386). Stepping into this supportive role, with the aim of helping children learn to use illustration clues( as well as text clues) to understand characters, requires that teachers prepare for and carefully orchestrate read-alouds. # Preparing for Read-Alouds # Some teachers come to the read-aloud with a background in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge about art, a good first step is building one 's own understanding of how illustrators convey meaning about characters. In Table 3, we list some resources teachers can use in learning more about the illustrator 's craft. # To explore visual characterization with children also requires the careful selection of picture books for the read aloud. In Table 4, we include a listing of character-rich picture books and identify visual devices of note that the illustrators of these books use in developing character. # Once a book is selected, we recommend that teachers carefully prepare for the read-aloud. Eeds and Peterson( 1991) envisioned teachers stepping into the role of " curator "( p. 119), or one who helps students develop literary insights. Preparation is the key to becoming a curator, and perhaps the best preparation is simply lingering over and reflecting on ways in which both the visual and verbal texts work to convey important information about characters. Also, in viewing the illustrations, teachers can ask themselves questions about characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem to say about the characters? # * Do the lines communicate meaning about character emotions? How? # * Where is the character placed on the page? What might this say about the character? # * What is of note about the facial expressions of the character? # * What do the actions and body posture of the character tell us? # These steps should help to ensure that teachers will be prepared to guide children in their explorations of the images in picture books. # Orchestrating Read-Alouds # Preparation for a read-aloud is an important first step, but what happens in the read-aloud is of paramount importance. First, teachers must ensure that all the children can see the illustrations and that they have time to linger over them. Just as we extended invitations in our interviews to look closely at illustrations, teachers too can pose such invitations by asking, " What do you see? " and " How do you know? " # Teachers can also ensure that children have opportunities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use with more complex picture books( Pantaleo, 2002, 2004). As children explore illustrations together, they extend and refine one another 's responses, which is just what happened when Ms. McGlothlin 's students studied the cover of A Beasty Story( Martin, 2002) : # Jacob : I think it is going to be about the four mice and the ghost because they look scared. They look happy right here but the ghosts scared them too much. # Sara : The mouse in the middle is going like this. holding her hands over her mouth # Ms. McGlothlin : Look at the mice real close and see if they are different. # Victor : Because one is like this and the next one is like that and the next one is like this mimicking the motions/facial expressions of the mice on the cover. And they have happy faces. # Sadie : But the last ones have scared faces. # Not only do children benefit from opportunities to explore illustrations collaboratively, but also researchers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights into illustrations( and the story) deepen even further( Arizpe &amp; Styles, 2003). # Finally, to help children learn more about how illustrators communicate character information, a teacher can step into the role of curator during read-aloud discussions and draw attention to particular artistic devices illustrators rely on to develop character( Maloch &amp; Duncan, 2006). For example, in sharing Lilly 's Purple Plastic Purse, a teacher might highlight the illustration of Lilly " breaking the frame " by noting, " This picture tells me how happy Lilly is! She is so happy that she is jumping right out of the picture! " # We began by talking about the importance of character understanding to literary meaning making. In picture books, this means that readers must be able to " read " both illustrations and the text of stories. We believe that the visual aspects of picture books have never received the same attention as written text. Therefore, it is only when we take steps to ensure that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children will be able to fully explore the characters they meet in picture books. # " Readers must thoughtfully attend to both sign systems -- the visual as well as the verbal -- to deeply understand the characters. " # " The children did not appear to be attuned to many of the visual devices intentionally used by illustrators. " # " Many children talked about how changes in color signaled change in the character 's feelings. " # " In justifying their inferences about characters, most students drew on their understanding of two art elements -- color and line. " # " Teachers have important work to do in fostering children 's visual literacy. " # Pause and Ponder # * Do I value and attend to illustrations as much as the written text during picture book read-alouds? # * How can we make sure children become aware of the devices illustrators use to develop characters in picture books? # * Why is it important to understand illustrators ' contributions in the development of characters in picture books? # TAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture book, think about the characters -- what are they like, how do they feel, how do they change? How do the illustrations help in conveying this information? Be prepared to guide children in recognizing these different facets of character. # 2. When reading aloud, invite the children to talk about what they learn about the characters from the words and from the images.3. During reading, encourage children to talk about the characters.4. Become a curator and talk with the children about particular ways( the children may not have noticed) that illustrators help readers understand characters.
