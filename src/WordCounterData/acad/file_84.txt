4012341 In the first part of this article, I tried to address the confusion that many people seem to have about the nature and use of intellect in the arts. My purpose there and in this essay is to discuss this condition, along with other associated dilemmas, what may lie behind them, and how they may be addressed. As I noted, this confusion about the intellect and the arts arises from several sources, including the emphasis on experientialism in contemporary culture, disciplinary territorializing in higher education, and disparate goals in the arts community itself. I have contended that, if music is perceived to bypass the mind, and if intellectual action is reserved only for word-based or mathematics-based theoretical and analytical comers of a culture, then it follows rather easily that intellectual engagement with music will either be dismissed as silliness or reserved for those who have chosen to intellectualize about it, including intellectualizing about its lack of intellectual substance. I argued that this is certainly the case in our culture, with the result that all connections between musical creator and music listener have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severing has enormous educational policy implications. Before going ahead to them, however, I need to focus on one final question to complete the basis for my argument. <p> What is intellect? The countless tracts on genius, creativity, and aesthetic awareness virtually leave no stone unturned in searching for an answer. My remarks are to be seen as personal reflections on this vast subject. I am a composer whose few works lie somewhere in the middling territory, certainly not of greatness, but, I hope, of goodness. However, I know this one thing : Whether my composing results in something good or not, the intellectual side of my imagination is continually at work from the start to the finish. Whatever is made of the word " inspiration " by dreamers, realists, cynics, philosophers or theologians, I know this : Virtually nothing of it is unearthly, otherworldly or daemonic. Citing none other than Mozart -- who to many is the mythological epitome of " at-once inspiration " -- I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compositional continuum. And with no less a person than Beethoven, I sketch, I re-sketch, and then sketch some more. I accept, I reject ; I erase ; and I doubt. But all along my mind is at work, gathering to itself a slowly acquired intellectual cabinet of knowledge tools, structural options, procedural mechanisms. From all of these, I end up with something that, in the best sense of the word, is intellectually completed yet intellectually unfinished. By this, I mean that the best art can only call out for more. Creativity is never done ; the task is richly endless. <p> Meanwhile, those who only wish to remark on my work or Mozart 's or Beethoven 's should understand that their thoughts about music are possible only because we thought in music. They would do well to understand that their thoughts are incomplete until they enter into our thoughts, and this is possible only by joining us in the making of music. Only in this sense is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do imagination and craft unite with the presentation of the same. If only the institution of art criticism, particularly that of the daily newspaper, were to think and to write in a way that points to the joy and labor of making art instead of creating a fuss over what might go wrong or who triumphs for a season, then the intellectual processes of audience, creator, and contemplator would be more deftly combined, and the making of art would be the shared pleasure. <p> Still, what is meant by intellect? Far more than mere intelligence or smartness, intellect is the love of ideas and the disciplining love of working them through in any discursive medium known to humankind. Nothing worth thinking up need be divorced from the workings of the intellect, unless of course we choose to cheapen it by not thinking. Intellect is driven by a desire to work in ideas : to analyze, to synthesize, to make beginning-to-end sense of things-among-things. It is to fuse simplicity and complexity and to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the indivisibility of form and content, of content and process, of poetry and grammar, if you will. Intellect is not only to see deeply and connect fully, but also to see that these depths and connections are not yet fully accomplished by themselves. Therefore, it is to hunger for conversation with other thinkers who have gone even farther, even if the conversation is one-sided, limited, or stunted. It is to feel the absence of that which, when discovered, still can not be fully comprehended. It is therefore to be seeing blindly and blindly seeing. It is to prefer seeing through a glass darkly because of the wealth of that which lies beyond, rather than to choose a clear glass that shows through to very little. Intellect is the glory of the unsure, the incomplete, the unsatisfied, preferred over " completeness " achieved at little cost. Intellect is that which labors far more than it is " inspired. " Maybe a hunch or an intuitive glance can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There remain seemingly endless times of labored workings-out that are, in themselves, as much a part of inspiration as an intuitional or spiritual surge. To the extent that this is true in any scientific, mathematical, philosophical, or theological sense, it is just as true of composing a piece of music or making a work of art. No matter how many stories we hear of flashes of genius in musical composition, no matter whether the musical product came quickly or slowly, no matter how much pleasure a masterpiece might bring, no matter how much we are tempted to overlook the intellectual fabric that lends the pleasure, no product of any worth came outside of the workings of the mind and all that such workings can pour into its completion. <p> " Except you become as little children " is not a statement about childishness or regression but about an initial and already-awake entrance into the life of the mind that wonders, dreams, and figures out unrealistically. It is this unrealism, this desire for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not think I exaggerate in this, nor do I identify with the kind of pro-child rhetoric that so often makes fools out of parents and gods out of children. I am simply reflecting on the dayspring of that which only at a later time in a person 's life dare we call intellect. I would rather think that intellect -- the love of the working out of ideas -- is a matter of kind before it is one of degree. It is not PhD 'd into existence, but found in place at birth. Recall the thought from Noam Chomsky that children come into the world bringing the sentence with them to which we can only add words. This sentence, this syntactical, procedural, relational capability, is the fountainhead of the intellect, not just brain, but mindedness. I am attached to this last word because it suggests a completion, a summing up of all that it means to be human. And for the rest of this article, " mindedness " is the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " intellect. " What Is Musical/Artistic Mindedness? <p> Given these general comments, how can we particularize? What is artistic mindedness? I believe it to have three sides or modes : creativity, valuing, spirit. Were we to keep these separate, we would end up with the kind of trichotomizing that has often plagued philosophers, behavioral scientists, and theologians. But to treat them as aspects or sides of one another allows for an intriguing inquiry into wholeness( which just as often has graced the thought of philosophers, behavioral scientists, and theologians). Hence we can say this : Each of these three modes participates in the other while remaining distinct. Yet each aspect, each mode, of the union contains the other as a whole. In this sense, there is an intrinsic and indivisible union of intrinsically identifiable sides : unity-in-distinction and distinction-in-unity. This is, of course, paradoxical, and so it should be, for in the final analysis, the entirety of mindedness is a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way. <p> First mindedness, or intellect, imagines and crafts. This is the creative aspect of intellect. Second, the artistic intellect values, sorts, and sifts. This is aesthetic mindedness of which taste is its outward action. Third, the expressive intellect is its spiritual side, where heartfelt passion and intensity spring up. It is quite easy to see how each of these modes participates in the other : Creativity is heartfelt and passionate, even as it sons and sifts. Sorting and sifting can not exist apart from imagination and craft. Sorting and sifting are not cold but heartfelt. And so on. The greatest art, therefore, occurs when we find a near-perfect balance among the three, where imagination, craft, taste, and expression consort easily together. Thus Bach, Mozart, da Vinci, Rembrandt, Shakespeare, Bartok, Monet, Eliott, and Barth ; thus the best of a civilization reaching into and enriching the best of which Everyman, to one degree or another, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of limiting our concept of intellectual content in music just to the presence of complex procedural mechanisms. From this, we select out a body of work that is " intellectually contrived " as compared to that which seemingly is not. We caricature this difference, for example, by referring to the former as classicist and the latter romanticist. But in doing this, we split the creative intellect into two directional forces, the rational and the emotional, or the worked-out and the lyrical. We then listen for the appearance and use of devices and mechanisms in " classicist " music and can relax this listening apparatus and " experience the lyricism " of the " romanticist spirit. " Our intellectualizing about romanticism is thus foreshortened by what we consider to be the absence of mechanism and device. Substituting for this are intellectual discussions of exterior and referential influences such as nature, program, and story. Therefore, we are prone to speak of the expressiveness of Chopin and are expected to soar, experience, and emote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we identify devices of invertible counterpoint, retrograde inversions, canons by augmentation, architectural acumen, and the like. But what of Bach 's lyricism and Chopin 's intellect? This question points up the fallacy : intellectual engagement some of the time and at other times personal identification. Neither, however, is ever entirely separate from the other. <p> So musical mindedness is not just systematic use of procedural devices and working out of puzzles and intricate structurings. The use of the intellect in any kind of creativity has to do with the control and shaping of a process even though there may not be any mechanistic " puzzle-solving " within it. If the emotional seems to be more prominent than the intellectual( or the reverse), this by no means posits an imbalance between idea and expression. The imbalance may, in fact, be in the mind of the analyst or the historian. That is, there are certainly intellectualized approaches to expressiveness and expressive approaches to intellectualization, irrespective of the historical or stylistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There is really very little use in assuming that certain great art works can be said only to be intellectual and other great art works only experiential. However, it is certainly true that in less-than-great art the primacy of the one or the other is overly stressed, thus overly noticeable. In such a case, intellect without expressiveness( while preferred by many self-conscious classicists) is just as objectionable as expressiveness without a steady use of the intellect( seemingly so much the case in present day popular music). Great art, irrespective of the first-glance noticeability of its mechanisms or its expressiveness is always a synthesis of deep thinking, deep feeling, and deep sorting out. The synthesis may lean in one or the other direction, but it is always a synthesis. <p> As educators, we need to seek a new intellectual level of teaching that goes beyond the usual music appreciation approach to the teaching both of talented musicians and general students, in which mutually exclusive code words and formulae are presented in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pedagogical short-cutting at its worst. The victim, of course, is the student, who soon finds out that this kind of pigeonholing does n't go very far, because all too soon the teacher begins to talk about the exceptions and uses the masterpiece to prove them. The irony is there is no pigeonhole for the exception. Even a piece of merely good art is an exception to every other piece of merely good art. If we should ever seek for a comprehensive pigeonhole, there should only be one : creative particularizations of procedural generalities, based on the threefold workings of creativity, valuing, and spirit. Then we can talk about synthesis instead of polarities. We can talk, for instance, about how the creative imagination takes up simultaneously with the lyrical and the procedural and then allows the one to influence the other or causes it to lean a certain way. <p> What kinds of intellectual techniques and procedures are involved when one designs a piece of music and/or prepares it for performance? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making choices among a near-infinity of possibilities. The field of ethnomusicology, which in its correct sense should be the study of all music, is devoted, at base, to the study of a vast aggregate of choices that both condition and are conditioned by an equally vast aggregate of choices constituting the fullness of culture and the vastness of the human imagination, as these latter two impinge on each other. While the choices that are made in any musical culture may be few as to basic. type, they redound, artifact after artifact, in multiplicities of multiplicities, no two of which are the same. Physical and mathematical phenomena aside, if there was ever an ages-old example of the elegance and wonder of chaos theory, it resides in the outpourings of human creativity. When on the pitch side alone, one considers that for nearly two thousand years of Western musical practice, the musical mind has been at work thinking through and playing out all of its processes, enigmas, puzzles, devices, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an infinity of overtonal options, then rationally manipulated to produce what we call equal-tempered tonality -- when one also considers that this working out is only a scratch on one creative surface compared to the many scratches on the many surfaces of the many musical systems of the world -- only then can one begin to see that without the ability to make choices, that is, without this profound thing called mindedness, negative chaos would be present. This is not the elegance of orderly asymmetry and unpredictable intelligibility that mark great art, but static meaninglessness and utter cacophony -- in other words, noise that literally has no interpretation, grounding point, no center or usefulness. <p> Pitch is only one of several areas in which contemplation and mastery must conjoin. We can not forget that the musical mind must take in and decide among mountains of artistic information and tradition that have been evolving over the centuries regarding texture, color, devices, formal and architectural strategies, and acoustics. Composers not only have had to hone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above, but have had to hide all of these in the final workings of their craft -- when to start, when to stop, and what to change. They must understand the difference between form and shape, minimal and maximal, and must then artistically hide the former in the latter. In the process of composing then, countless split-second decisions( a word all to often reserved only for corporate managers), both tactical and strategic( words likewise sequestered by managers and soldiers), must be made. In the final analysis, not one of these decisions is possible without intellectual engagement of the first order. Otherwise, how could a Bruckner or a Bartok or Rautavaara or a Part create such expansive, far-seeing works that, in their comprehensive integration of tension, compression, and design, are held together just the way Chartres, the Taj Mahal, or the Golden Gate Bridge is? When small-minded and provincial intellectuals rise to the podium, and, with words about, imply that composers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow bring a kind of spiritualized, emotionally driven Jell-O into being, it demeans the fullness of what it is to exercise mindedness in the creation of works of art. <p> In addition to compositional mastery, all composers go through parallel rigors learning how to play at least one instrument, not passably but expertly. Furthermore, many have turned their mindedness to new ways of analyzing music( Paul Hindemith, for instance, in The Craft of Musical Composition), constructing new syntactical models( for instance, Arnold Schoenberg, Olivier Messiaen) and philosophical thought about music( for instance, Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, Roger Sessions, Aaron Copland). In these latter examples, the philosophical thought( thinking about) has a particular credibility because it has grown up from within the act of thinking in, the latter the intellectual dayspring of the former. <p> So we have this wonder called choice coupled to this wonder called the human imagination and this global consortium called human creativity. What is it -- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " romantically " initiated and " otherly " manifest, in a being who is, at the moment, out of control, but otherwise -- for example, when it comes to spreading bread with butter -- in control. Likewise, it is not just a disinterested, wonderless, mechanistic, smart-minded bringing together of things. Each of these extremes, however, when examined closely, describes a spectrum -- better yet, a circumference -- or in another sphere, a dialectic. In no case in human creativity can the one exist without the other. One may be more noticeable in one individual than in another, but this by no means calls their basic unity into question. Flights of fancy, the daemon, the muse, on the one hand -- call it what you will -- and the calculation, the discipline, the order of things, on the other -- call these what you will -- they are finally aspects of each other brought into submission by the remarkable gift of being humanly and wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is the created-in ability to think something up and then to craft it. This kind of definition spares us the conceit of assuming that creativity is an " arts only " word, yet the arts in all of their magnitude can do no more than imagine and craft. Likewise, a definition of this sort brings fancy and rigor together under the mastery of thinking up. This does mean the omission or derogation of " spirit " or " heart " or anything of the like. Thinking up, whether it leans toward spirit and ecstasy or reason and control, is still thinking up. And crafting, whether coloring inside or outside the lines, is still crafting. Wherever the emphasis lies, in the spirited thought or the thoughtful spirit, we simply can not overlook the fullness of individual, corporate, and even cultural mindedness that presides over any musical act. <p> Given this understanding of mindedness as a synthesis of spirit, creativity and valuing, given an understanding of creativity as the organic coupling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between composing and performing? It is often thought that creating the work of art is more creative than performing it. This is false, given the concepts of mindedness explained previously. If creating a work of art is a coupling of imagining and crafting, so is its performance. A musical score by no means gives the performer the complete set of clues as to the artistry with which it is to be performed. The score is to the actual music, not what a blue print is to an actual building, but what a set of laws is to ethical living or a map is to an actual journey. In the case of the blueprint and the building, the latter is the determined outcome of the former and is capable of numberless reiterations. But in the case of law and lawful living, there is no such direct connection. Any one human being is going to go about obeying( or disregarding) the laws in a manner that is determined by the spirit, understanding, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the law. Likewise, when one reads a map, one goes about the journey with the ' chaotic " potential offered by imagination and craft, which goes far beyond the abstractions of the map. <p> So it is with performance. While imagination and craft certainly go into the creation of the score, it takes imagination and craft to bring the score into hearable/seeable being. The gap between the two minds is bridgeable only through the exercise of creativity, for there is no tangible, measurable, guaranteeable way of connecting the two. There is no artistic fax machine by which the mindedness of the composer is duplicated in the mind of the performer ; otherwise a score would be equally realizable by an infinite number of performers, just as any number of similar buildings would be realizable from the same blueprint. The connection between the blueprint and the building is one of craft alone.( If there is any imagination, it would be where the crafter might have to invent a process or a tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this would be similar to a piano builder building a better piano in order that the score can be effectively played.) The realized connection between score and performance includes craft but is overseen by imagination, not a grain of which is abetted by the score, yet not a grain of which is realizable without craft. <p> This idea can serve as a platform for distinguishing between a presentation and a re-presentation of music. If the creation of a work of art( its composition) can be called a presentation, its performance can only be called a representation. Or, if the original process of making a work of art can be called creative, its performance can be called re-creative. In both cases, I have used a hyphen to bring out a particularity that the unhyphenated counterparts( representation and recreation) overlook, in that representation is often equated with imitation or replication. A painting is said to be representational if a barn in the painting looks like the barn being painted. Uninformed or literalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually imitates the barn being painted. Sophisticated viewers will instead ask this question : To what extent do the skill and soul of the painter combine to bring a particular stylization to the barn being painted, even to the extent that it can no longer be called imitative, or even representational, even though both the painter and the viewer know it to be a barn? In this case, the barn is being re-presented, not represented. <p> An analogy from nature may further the point. Take any two strawberries and compare them. Superficially one represents the other. We might even say that they imitate each other, in the sense that we mistakenly call biological twins identical. But to say this destroys the individuality of each. Which strawberry is the original, if one of them is a representation of the other? And how can two individuals be identical? But if we consider each to be a re-presentation of the other, then each is inherently itself ; each of the millions of other strawberries grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each of a family of octuplets will be presentationally unique. Putting things this way does away with two fallacies :( a) art imitates life by representing it, but in so doing sets up a false hierarchy of which has the primacy ;( b) art 's task is to bring some kind of concreteness to an idealized essence " out there "( the strawberry-ness of strawberries, for example, thus leading to the return of the old ghost of Platonism). <p> In regard to musical performance, when the composer, through the force of his creative gifts, brings final shape to a welter of carefully integrated materials and processes, he makes a presentation of it in the form of a score. This score, as has already been stated, says all that the composer can say about it, in this form, and no more. The completed sonic idea can only be realized in a re-presentation by the performer. It is impossible for him to imitate or replicate the composer 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniquely gifted artist and the performer is a uniquely gifted artist. One is not the clone of the other, and the score is not a clone of the music that the composer had in mind. To bring this imagined and crafted work into a sounded reality, the performer must imagine and craft as persistently, as spiritedly, and as thoughtfully as the composer. Just as the composer has had to bring a huge arsenal of intellectual technique to bear on the starting, working-through, and completion of the work, so must the performer. If it is not enough to say that mystical inspiration alone is behind composing, it is not enough to say that all the performer does is to vibrate with the mystique. For a performer to realize a score in the spirit of the mindedness that went into its composition, enormous mindedness is demanded in return. <p> To educate without taking this into mind and, as has been repeated before, to separate performance in from thoughts about is tragically to miss the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about. It dehumanizes it by falsely mysticizing it and, in an ironic twist, pretends to make the composer and the performer into something larger than life. In this context, the listener likewise need not think, for he or she has but to enter into this mythical largeness and be carried along unthinkingly, experientially. But great art and all experiences of it are brought about by the induplicable individualities of composer, performer, and perceiver that are in common with one another. They are bound together in a mutual exercise of finding each other out, as deeply as possible. Sophisticated words about music, even those that are driven by imagination and craft, will not suffice, if they give the impression that they take the place of the understood musical experience itself, or fill in the gaps that were left unaccounted for by the muse, the daemon. They are not the musical experience ; they are only about it. Likewise, having a musical experience without engaging the mind in its completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases, it is just as necessary for the performer and the listener to think in music, and be satisfied with no less than this, as it is for the composer. All three are in league with one another by being grounded in the same discursive language. To be sure, the composer and the performer are, in most cases, the experts, and the listeners are, in most cases, the laymen. But the difference between the expert and they layman is one of degree, not kind. The layman may miss a fair amount, especially in the beginning stages of thinking in music. But this is what great civilizations and enriched cultures are about : bringing the expert and the amateur into common discourse, to the extent that a community of imagining and crafting persons -- each of whom has some sort of specialty, some kind of language to think in -- is at work gaining continual ground by enlivening one another. <p> Accomplishing this is hard work, but it is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music must be a part of any kind of teaching, just as the teaching of mathematics is a part of any kind of teaching. For as long as we think of music as something " to do something else by, " we err. Even though, as has already been said, music is the easiest of all forms of discourse, to do something else by, that does not excuse us from bringing it out of this particular grace and into a larger one, the grace of what Nicholas Wolterstorff calls perceptual contemplation, in which imagination, craft, experience, the spiritual, and the functional are all at work together in the pleasure of thinking in. <p> In summary of all of the preceding, the following scheme may be of use. In ascending order of educational value, the use of the intellect in the arts takes the following turns : It can involve words and thoughts alone about the arts, based purely on philosophical knowledge about how they are created, how they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep thought about anything, whatever its depth, to the extent that depth is imputed to it. This is thinking about without thinking in. This is situation that has split arts education into humanities-based and performance-based provinces. It is short-sighted, divisive, and prejudiced. It can involve words and thoughts about the arts based on modified experiences with the arts( reading, listening, using memorized taste) that have yet to include regular experiences in. This middle ground has some merit in that words and thoughts about have been partially informed by parallel artistic experiences. Music criticism, music appreciation approaches to musical content, and socially appropriate concert-going are cases in point. It can involve a synthesis of thinking about and experiences in( through both performing and creating) that results in thoughts about issuing from experiences in. This is the goal toward which all arts education should strive. The amateur and the professional are similarly at work but to different degrees. It is possible only through the superintending that mindedness can bring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education <p> What is a completed musical education? Here I am talking about educating not music major specialists, but amateurs, although I fully believe that were music major specialists to be completely educated, as suggested in the body of this article, they would be even more prepared to undertake multiple cultural tasks, as the following remarks intend to show. <p> Given the building up of knowledge about multiple intelligences, learning styles, and the enormously diverse learning skills of even the average baby and child, and given the fact that each one is born with the ability to think in before thinking about, music education must begin, continue, and proceed further into the reaches of making music as the originating cause of all other learning about music. Why take a little child, one of whose primary instincts is to make music and, leaving that behind or relegating it to a separate, specialist community, move on into other kinds of instruction that depend less and less on the use of music 's primary language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, charts, diagrams, tracts, and treatises? Why ca n't we understand that responding to music with music is no less sensible than responding to words with words? Why do we persist in mixing our languages when we can coordinate them? <p> What would students gain from this? The answer is simple. Their minds would be entered into more richly than is presently the case. Despite the all-too-prevalent talk about the Mozart effect, and careless words about left-and right-brain phenomena, there is something more to be reckoned with. The deep thinkers in the areas of multiple intelligences, learning styles, and cognition -- those who imagine and craft in their particularities about imagining and crafting in multiple particularities -- are showing us exciting things. We are coming to understand how thinking in the arts brings much more diversity to anyone 's capabilities than merely thinking about the arts. We are coming to understand that thinking in the arts is learning to reason in another way, is learning to imagine in another way, and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people manifoldly cultural, manifoldly useful. Thinking one way about multiple things is, by contrast, quite limiting, but that is precisely what speech logic-based education does. Education should be about entering a student 's mind in as many ways as possible rather than entering it in one or two ways( words and numbers) about many things. The former leads more quickly to a synthesized world view and its comprehensive applications( call this wisdom), while the latter simply adds to our already-saturated and strangely narrowed down data base( call this information). <p> America is a nation educationally torn between the ideal or intrinsic and the practical. Liberal arts education hopes to speak for the former and vocationalism for the latter. But the tragedy is that both are speaking more and more similarly, not as if there were a synthesis between the two, but as if the latter is the secret to the former. Here is what I mean : If the liberal arts were honestly at work, every discipline within it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intrinsically works. It would be given the time and space to articulate itself accordingly. Every educator within its philosophical framework, whatever his or her particular discipline, would not only have to support this, but would personally obligated to be articulate in the discursive ways by which each discipline discloses itself. This would mean a kind of language literacy that goes radically beyond learning all the disciplines through the medium of speech logic, or learning related speech logic languages( French, German, etc.). To proceed this way would not only mean being liberally educated but poly-vocationally potent. <p> But what is really the case? Even in the most sophisticated of liberal learning establishments, most of the educators are experts in the specialties, the aggregate sum of which is the liberal arts. This is profoundly different than saying that each practitioner is liberally educated. If that were the case, then a liberal arts institution would be a synergy instead of an incomplete sum, and each practitioner would be a micro-synergy within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were all students educated this way, and, most especially, were teachers trained to be this way, then in the day-to-day workings of our public schools and institutions of higher learning, mindedness would be a multi-discursive wonder. Our culture would be slowly peopled with completed people instead of specialists in one thing( if that) who can only think about another thing. Perhaps the greatest challenge lying before us is that of re-dignifying the liberal arts by reshaping it according to its fundamental nature, thus divesting it of its hypocrisy, of the mismatch between orthodoxy and orthopraxy. <p> It is impossible to enter into any kind of education without bringing the workings of the mind and the intellect into continuous prominence. To follow those who say that experiencing music( in the usual sense) is all we need, to follow those who assume that the ease with which music is experienced suffices, to rest with those whose satisfaction in the arts lies only in words that they craft about the arts ; to do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speech Logic <p> Let me clarify about words and speech logic at this point. All along, I have not been derogating words, nor thinkers who use them wisely. I believe in the primary power of words. Otherwise, I would not be using words to argue for other powerful ways of knowing and discoursing ; otherwise I would not have decried their prostitution in contemporary culture. Despite all the racy talk about the propositional accuracy of nonverbal expression, words are the only medium that we have for conveying propositional truth, and propositional truth is needed now more than ever. Even those who like to argue that speech logic is meaningless, who argue that there is no real truth, no central set of meanings, have to use speech logic in a centrally accurate way to make their point : They must use speech logic say that there is none. Therefore I plead for words to be given their rightful place in every sector of our culture. The argument all along has been with words that are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus limiting a great part of the educational experience to the aboutness of a thing. So in the final analysis, we gladly and humbly must turn back to words, but now using them eloquently and accurately to plead for the recognition that they are not enough for a completed arts education. <p> As educators and policymakers, we need to revisit the full union of creativity, values, and spirit -- what I keep calling intellect and mindedness. We need to bring intense intellectual work back into direct contact with the intense making of art. We need to do away with the disjunctive intellectualism that lends dignity where dignity is not deserved, and we need to( re) create the kind that unites the contemplation of something with the very doing of it. This can not be accomplished until the doers of art learn to think deeply about its doing and the thinkers about the arts begin to engage in the doing of them. <p> As to the kinds of music we study, we can not afford even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefront. Unless we assume that there is a best kind of music, we will have no way of describing a better kind, or a good kind, or a least good. Mediocrity does not appear in a vacuum. It appears only in comparison to that which towers above it. Multiculturalism, politically correct or truly genuine, can not dampen the recognition and pursuit of greatness. We can mistakenly use it as a disguise for valueless, goody-goody talk about anything made by anybody and validated by their " dignity, " without remembering that while dignity comes of being human, so does differentiating and preferring. True and honest multiculturalism will therefore deal with more than abstract equality. It will deal with equality as the basis for excelling and excelling as the means by which one thing can serve as an example, a corrective, or an improvement for another. It is not prejudicial to say that one artifact is better than another, unless it is if we demean one person or exalt another on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring flesh to the reality of intellectual promise and fulfillment in every kind of imagining and crafting, once we grasp the full meaning of intellectual wholeness in artistic action, once we wake up to the ongoing rightness of pursuing greatness in every sector of our inquiries and pedagogies, once we understand that education does not change modes as age increases, and once we understand that the true worth of any inquiry and creative action lies in giving primary attention to the preposition in and derivative attention to its relative about, we will have achieved a major educational victory, not just for the arts but for culture as a whole. Then, we might just have won the war. Some Concluding Suggestions <p> At the very highest national policy levels, as well as in all institutions of learning, it is my view that the following things need to be done : Arts-based and humanities-based approaches to the arts must be brought under a single understanding that direct intellectual engagement with the arts, including literacy and creativity in their indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about providing students with enrichment, aesthetic experience, and cultural sophistication, the arts should be understood as comprehensive forms of intellectual and creative discourse on their own terms. Therefore, the teaching of music and art, beginning with the youngest students and continuing after, must combine direct presentational experience in the greatest art with immediate creative response to that art on the part of the students. This means no less than responding to music with music, and to art with art, which further means that thinking in art must be united with thinking up music and thinking up art -- not in some simperingly encouraged " self expression " but in disciplined and imaginative response in kind to the art and music at hand, no matter how initially backward the response might be. Small steps are essential : An awkward response in kind is exactly the way the smallest infant begins a cry for milk and grows ever so wondrously into creating sonnets. Beyond the inherent value of making and presenting art as described above, it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will develop intellectual capabilities -- other ways of knowing and doing -- not otherwise attainable, and that these capabilities will further enrich the undertaking of a number of occupational tasks outside the arts. In other words, comprehensive arts studies are to seen as comprehensively liberating, not just specifically enriching. In any educational setting, the above implies that so-called liberal arts curriculum, so generously overloaded with speech-specific disciplines, will have to be revised to accommodate additional course work in other discursive disciplines. If the intent of liberal learning is to liberate comprehensively, and thus to equip comprehensively, then the curricula must reflect conceptual insight providing each student with as many ways of knowing as possible. More specifically, in music and arts units or institutions of higher education, undue imbalance between performance and **25;1216;TOOLONG, or between word-based and music-and arts-based approaches to learning must be addressed. It is just as important for professional musicians and artists to be comprehensively educated -- as one aspect of what it means to be liberally educated in their respective disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate managers. There must also be reform in pedagogy and pedagogical training -- not just continued and demythologized attention to how children create and learn, but vigorous inquiry into how their teachers are prepared. At all levels of K-12 teacher education, the focus must be on the making of art and music. Music and arts educators should be, above all, skilled creators or art and music ; their skills in this regard should be considered before their methodology or their aesthetics become issues. Thinking in and thinking up music then become the fountainhead of pedagogy, and it is primarily in this light that teaching skills are to be recognized and validated. <p> Let me return to my most important point : Educational institutions at all levels, including institutions of higher learning, must take responsibility for crafting curricula, both for majors and nonmajors, in which nothing less than improvisation and composition( and their procedural counterparts in other art forms) would serve as the fountainhead for any and all other aspects of learning in the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical, and even the cultural aspects of any of the arts would gain different significance by being seen as symptomatic and coordinative rather than as substitutes or causes. For example, instead of trying to determine what form a piece of music might be in, the question of what music could be found in the form would be asked. Instead of preceding compositional studies with theory( as if the latter were the seat of the former), one would begin and continue with improvisation and composition( the one simply being a different temporal extension of the other) in order to show how imagination creates its own syntactical clarity and consistency -- that is, how, by analogy, poetic vision shapes yet acknowledges grammatical traditions. Students should be encouraged to respond to the art form in the art form itself. Let this be the cornerstone of arts education policy. <p> By Harold M. Best <p> <p> Harold M.
