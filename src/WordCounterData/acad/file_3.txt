4000441 There seems only one cause behind all forms of social misery : bigness. It appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation. Wherever something is wrong, something is too big. -- Leopold Kohr, The Breakdown of Nations <p> <p> To undergraduates universities are landlords, to scholars they are multidisciplinary think tanks, to entrepreneurs they are applied research parks, to economic development officials they are economic growth centers, and to gung-ho alumni they are sponsors of professional football and basketball teams disguised as college teams. Is it any wonder that the cost of higher education is out of control and that the mission of most universities appears to be garbled and inconsistent? American universities have tried unsuccessfully to be all things to all people. In so doing they find themselves in too many unrelated and disconnected businesses. They have become academic behemoths. <p> During higher education 's " roaring eighties " we said no to almost no one. By the nineties, we had become virtually unmanageable. This is a far cry from the fifties and sixties when universities were viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals as agents of social change, and by taxpayers as avenues of social mobility. <p> Overspecialization and functional isolation are two reasons college costs consistently outpace inflation. Each department or professional school is an island unto itself, cooperating with no one. Promotions and faculty salaries are closely linked to publications within one 's narrowly defined discipline. Departments compete for students and resources. Research and writing are rewarded ; teaching is not. <p> It is not uncommon for a university 's business school, divinity school, law school, engineering school, and medical school each to have its own separate library. The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University has its own dining hall, computer center, audiovisual center, placement service, alumni office, and luxury hotel for executive education programs. <p> The cost of high-tech research equipment soared in the 1970s and 1980s -- particularly in engineering, physical science, and medicine. The cost of research in such fields as particle physics and molecular biology is prohibitively expensive. But is all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates with a well-rounded liberal arts education? We think not. <p> Undergraduate education and state-of-the-art research are two quite different businesses. Does it make sense to try to combine them under one umbrella called a university? Middlebury College is an excellent undergraduate educational institution. MIT, Caltech, and the Stanford Research Institute are world-class research institutes. Should not Amherst, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, and Williams specialize in undergraduate teaching, and MIT, Caltech, and Carnegie Mellon in basic and applied research? The necessary skills for successful research grantsmanship are not the same skills required to be a good undergraduate teacher. Why do so many academics pretend otherwise? <p> The prevailing attitude among most state universities, caught in the competition for tax dollars since World War II, has been " bigger makes better. " Now we find ourselves burdened with huge institutions. There is a serious need for downsizing. There are also, we believe, far too many universities in the United States. Some are so tiny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Others are so large that they are fundamentally unmanageable. The state of North Carolina, for example -- a relatively poor state with a population of 6.8 million -- has no fewer than fifteen state universities plus another seven private universities. The state also has four medical schools -- two public and two private. On the other hand, tiny Vermont sensibly has only one state university. <p> The proliferation of universities with the inherent duplication of programs and infrastructure has contributed significantly to the skyrocketing cost of higher education. America needs not more universities but more small undergraduate colleges. But we have acted as if sheer size makes no difference when it comes to achieving the mission of higher education. <p> Countering the trend toward giantism in universities is well-managed Oklahoma City University with only 4,660 students, of which 2,400 are undergraduates. Although OCU 's strong international programs attract students from 71 different countries, 75 percent of OCU 's undergraduates -- including many American Indians -- are from Oklahoma. OCU produces a high-quality product, at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university campuses. The administrators of OCU seem to know what business they are in and have created an environment with a strong sense of community between faculty and students. <p> Just as there are too many small universities whose quest for university status has distracted them from the task of undergraduate education, there are also too many universities that have become inefficient, dehumanized, bureaucratic agglomerations of unrelated businesses. Undergraduate, professional, graduate, and adult education ; housing ; food service ; dental and health care services ; book publishing ; agricultural extension services ; management consulting ; public service ; and semiprofessional athletics are among the plethora of unrelated businesses in which large universities find themselves. <p> With 52,183 students, 38,958 of whom are undergraduates, the Columbus campus of Ohio State University, the largest university in the United States, more closely resembles a small city than an academic community. It is not alone : Mega-Universities PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Throughout the 1960s, many universities grew haphazardly, without any well-defined sense of direction. New programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new sources of government funding. Not unlike the programs of the federal government, obsolete academic programs are seldom allowed to die. Instead, they continue indefinitely, long after their original rationale has faded. Restructuring Higher Education <p> We believe that what is called for in higher education is nothing less than a complete restructuring of universities, including the way they are organized, the way undergraduates are taught, and the substance of the curriculum. The ultimate aim of restructuring is to improve the quality of undergraduate education, increase its value, and reduce its costs -- to create a community of scholars and teachers that will enhance students ' critical thinking skills and their search for meaning. <p> While we know that smallness alone is no guarantee of a school 's educational effectiveness, we do believe that a large size is a mostly negative factor in achieving the goals of higher education. Universities are not immune to the law of decreasing returns with regard to increased size. We would estimate the optimum-size undergraduate learning environment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand students subdivided into English-style residential colleges of around three hundred students each. Large state universities, with their dehumanizing high-rise dormitories, legions of graduate teaching assistants, and tens of thousands of undergraduates are antithetical to the pursuit of knowledge, meaning, and community. There are those who respond, " But do n't many students at larger schools do quite well on standardized tests like the GRE or the LSAT? " Such arguments fail to move us. The quantification and standardization of education, represented in such tests, is precisely what we are arguing against. Even relatively small universities like Duke, with 6,130 undergraduates, and the University of Vermont, with 7,925, are difficult to control. Viable undergraduate learning communities at the mega-universities described previously are an almost impossible dream. <p> What we are proposing is downsizing colleges and universities to a more reasonable scale and eventually decoupling undergraduate education from the largest of them. Growth at universities with more than five thousand undergraduates should be brought to a halt. Proposals for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, large universities should either completely spin off their undergraduate programs or significantly decentralize them in a manner consistent with the residential college mode. Too many of our universities resemble General Motors of the fifties. While American business has radically transformed the World War II-induced behemoths churning out haphazardly built products, American higher education is still saddled with huge institutional relics that produce assembly-line graduates. American higher education must show some of the same creativity and courage that we have seen recently in much of American business. Downsizing is the order of the day. <p> The three best-known American examples of the residential college systems are Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Yale 's twelve residential colleges are self-sufficient communities within Yale College, each with its own dining hall, library, courtyard, seminar rooms, practice rooms, and numerous other facilities, from darkrooms to printing presses, from game rooms to saunas. At the end of their first year, Harvard students are assigned to a house in which they will live for the remainder of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior tutor or dean, a tutorial staff, a library, and dining facilities. All houses are coeducational, and much of the social, athletic, extracurricular, and academic life at Harvard centers on the house. At Princeton all freshmen and sophomores live and dine in one of five residential colleges. A small number of juniors and seniors live and eat in the residential colleges, but most live in the upperclass dorms, and more than half dine in Princeton 's well-known independent eating clubs. <p> We are not suggesting that the residential college system, as practiced by the aforementioned universities, is a panacea. We know that the residential college experiments at the University of Virginia and at Princeton have had their critics. Yet we do defend the notion that size is an important issue. Even with the residential college system, size mitigates against the benefits of residential colleges when, as is the case at Harvard, there are 6,672 undergraduates dominated by 11,601 graduate students and professional students. <p> In 1994, tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to education and its high tuition, sent shock waves through the American higher education establishment when it announced its plans to implement one of the most radical college restructuring schemes ever conceived. The reconfiguration called for faculty and staff reductions, the abolition of tenure, the elimination of traditional academic departments, a 10 percent cut in tuition and fees, the adoption of an alternative contractual system for faculty, and the establishment of a revolving venture-capital fund to support innovative new faculty ideas. <p> All of this was in response to declining enrollments, a $1 million deficit, serious erosion of academic standards, poor faculty morale, and organizational chaos. Bennington was not only out of control, it was in a death spiral. But to its credit, Bennington was small enough and flexible enough to reinvent itself. Most large colleges and universities are not. <p> Over the long term, during the next decade, we are proposing that large universities withdraw from the undergraduate teaching business. The university of the future would consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research institutions, adult education, and professional outreach services. State universities would provide support services to a network of colleges not located on the central university campus, including administrative and financial services, library services, and central computing facilities, as well as specialized courses for advanced undergraduates. Seniors in satellite colleges affiliated with the university might be allowed to take a limited number of graduate courses at the university. <p> Moreover, we encourage those who charge that these proposals would be extravagantly expensive to be honest about the extravagance, the waste, and the redundancy present in the large educational institutions. There are functions of the university, particularly those that thrive on communication, interaction, and cooperation, where costs increase and efficiency declines as the bureaucracy grows. Downsizing is not a call to withdraw from the commitment to educate the largest possible number of qualified students, but rather an attempt to give all of our students the best possible education by the most efficient means. <p> To finance the shift toward decentralized liberal arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graduate programs. For many states -- not including California, New York, and Texas -- there is little need for multiple, state-supported medical schools, law schools, and engineering schools. Many underfinanced, undersubscribed universities should be downsized back to colleges. Having experienced a couple of decades during which numerous colleges and two-year institutions frantically moved toward pinning the name " university " upon themselves, we must now help these schools recover the dignity, the focus, and the efficiency that comes from reclaiming their identity as colleges dedicated to undergraduate education. <p> Not every state needs a dental school, a veterinary school, or state-of-the-art research institutions in nuclear physics and microbiology. The cold war is over and we do not need nearly so many nuclear physicists, mathematicians, chemists, and defense-related engineers. As taxpayers demand cutbacks in the defense budget, research universities are going to discover painfully how much of their intellectual activity has been dictated by the Pentagon. A preoccupation with short-run profitability and stock prices has prompted American companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is there less demand for Ph.D.s in basic science and engineering, but there is also less private and government funding available to support expensive high-tech research in these fields. Be well assured that if our faculties and administrators do not take this opportunity, they shall then be led through the humiliating process of having legislators and mere market pressures hack their schools to pieces, bit by bit. <p> Graduate education has always cost more than undergraduate education because of small class sizes and laboratory equipment requirements. Universities should become much more selective in choosing departments and fields in which to offer Ph.D. degrees. The manner in which some graduate departments continue to produce Ph.D.s in fields already oversupplied borders on the immoral. Those who would defend the mega-universities on the basis of their altruistic desire to provide the largest possible number of students with access to higher education ought honestly to examine how much potential undergraduate funding is siphoned off at these institutions by expensive, glamorous, but relatively unproductive graduate and professional programs. For too long undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the university for graduate and professional work. We want to reverse that process, inviting universities to see themselves as existing for and supportive of the task of undergraduate education. <p> Since professors in newly emerging liberal arts colleges will not be under the university publish-or-perish mandate, they can be expected to teach more -- perhaps as many as four or five courses per semester. <p> As universities begin downsizing and cutting back on their undergraduate programs, former undergraduate dormitories can either be transformed to graduate and professional dormitories or converted to apartment buildings or much-needed housing for the elderly. We see much educational value in colleges attempting to foster more interaction between the generations. <p> With modern telecommunications networks, universities may offer their satellite colleges televised courses on topics too specialized to be included in the curricula of most small colleges, such as Chinese, Japanese, advanced physics, and molecular biology. Universities might be seen as resource centers that offer support for strong undergraduate colleges, the strong undergraduate colleges being the basic units of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as their norm to emulate. <p> Why should universities continue to support big-time football and basketball programs? University stadiums and basketball field houses could be sold or rented to nearby professional teams. In downsizing, intercollegiate athletics would return to the scale on which it existed before World War II. Small colleges would compete among themselves for the pleasure of it, not to train professional athletes and hype alumni and state legislators. If athletic scholarships were continued, their educational usefulness, not simply their athletic value, would need to be demonstrated. <p> For decades, on many campuses, fraternities and sororities have provided a second-best alternative to the residential college system in America. In their fraternity or sorority, students found the sense of community they craved, but which the college or university failed to provide. Indeed, the very existence of the Greek system may at least partially explain why so few colleges and universities have adopted the English residential college plan. <p> Obviously, restructuring higher education will be a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as multimillion-dollar industrial conglomerates have outlived their usefulness and have given way to more creative adaptations, so too will large mega-university degree factories. It is not by chance alone that small colleges such as Amherst, Dartmouth, Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, and Williams command premium prices in the marketplace. They charge high tuition because they provide a high value-added product. <p> By attempting to be all things to all people, large-scale universities have allowed their most important business -- undergraduate education -- to be seriously eroded. For too long university trustees and state legislators have been biased toward professional schools and graduate education. It 's time to turn the situation around, to recover the centrality of undergraduate education. <p> By Thomas H. Naylor and William H. Willimon <p> <p> Thomas H.
