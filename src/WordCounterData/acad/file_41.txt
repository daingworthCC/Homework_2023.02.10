4005241 Controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation. The present study used a cross-sectional design to examine social cognitive predictors of creatine use versus non-use among 148 male, undergraduate, recreational resistance trainers. Seventy participants( 47.3%) reported creatine use. Creatine users had higher self-efficacy for resistance-training with creatine, t( 146) = 4.98, p <.001, higher positive outcome expectancies for improved workout performance, t( 146) = 2.3 7, p =.019, and lower negative outcome expectancies for creatine use, t( 146) = 4.90, p <.001. No significant differences were found for self-efficacy for resistance training without creatine or negative outcome expectancies for improved workout performance. Logistic regression analysis revealed that social cognitive variables accounted for 25 % of the variance in creatine use. The results lay the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical, social cognitive perspective. <p> Creatine is one of the most popular performance enhancing supplements among college students( Williams &; Anderson, 2000), and has received recent attention from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 ; Shaifali, 1998 ; Smith, 2000). Despite this popularity, controversy exists concerning the efficacy and safety of creatine supplementation ; roughly equal evidence exists supporting positive effects and supporting null effects of supplementation on performance( Demant &; Rhodes, 1999 ; Graham &; Hatton, 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky, 1998a ; Williams &; Branch, 1998). Numerous anecdotal accounts illustrate adverse side effects, such as kidney dysfunction, effects on the body 's creatine and insulin production, diarrhea, gastrointestinal pain, muscle cramping, and dehydration( Benzi, 2000 ; Graham &; Hatton, 1999 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky, 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux, 2000). In addition, Metzl et al.( 2001) hypothesize that creatine may be a gateway drug to other more harmful performance enhancing substances such as dehydroepiandrosterone( i.e., DHEA) and androstenedione( i.e., andro ; King et al., 1999). <p> Although laboratory studies of creatine 's efficacy are numerous, field studies of creatine supplementation patterns have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, resistance trainers, who are the target of marketing strategies that emphasize creatine 's ability to increase body mass( Benzi, 2000 ; Juhn &; Tarnopolsky, 1998b ; Poortmans &; Francaux, 2000 ; Williams &; Branch, 1998) and appear to be a major consumer group in the creatine market( Demant &; Rhodes, 1999). Moreover, the present authors found no studies that examine relationships between psychological variables and performance enhancing supplement use in this population. Previous creatine studies have examined expectations( Labotz &; Smith, 1999) and perceptions( Greenwood et al., 2000 ; Juhn, O'Kane, &; Vinci, 1999 ; LaBotz &; Smith, 1999 ; Ray et al., 2001 ; Sheppard et al., 2000 ; Schilling et al., 2001) of the positive and negative effects of creatine supplementation among users, but have not looked at differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to these psychological variables. Research on steroid use suggests that psychological variables may be important. Lovstakken, Peterson and Homer( 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with higher risk of steroid use, and negative social expectations associated with lower risk of steroid use among college students. Goldberg et al.( 1996) used a psycho-educational intervention to decrease intentions to use steroids and increase resistance-training self-efficacy in male high school athletes. In working to understand creatine use among recreational weight trainers, the present study examines differences between creatine users and non-users with respect to psychological variables that are theorized to precede behavior. <p> Social cognitive theory( SCT ; Bandura, 1986) provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding creatine use by addressing its specific behavioral, personal, and environmental influences. That is, self-efficacy and outcome expectancies specifically related to the use of creatine can help us understand why some resistance trainers use creatine while others do not. <p> Self-efficacy is defined as belief in one 's ability to take certain actions to produce desired attainments( Bandura, 1997). In the present study, improvement of resistance-training performance is the attainment, while creatine use is one course of action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resistance-training self-efficacy is broken down into two components : self-efficacy with creatine, and self-efficacy without creatine. Creatine users are expected to have higher self-efficacy with creatine than non-users. However, according to SCT, use of medications can undermine self-efficacy if successes are ascribed to medication rather than to personal capabilities( Bandura, 1997, see p. 274). Therefore, creatine users are expected to have lower self-efficacy without creatine than non-users. <p> Outcome Expectancies -- the positive and negative outcomes expected as a result of producing desired attainments depend on efficacy beliefs and serve as incentives and disincentives for behavior( Bandura, 1997). In this study, outcome expectancies reflect the interactive relationship between perceived likelihood of outcomes and the subjective values placed on those outcomes( Bandura, 1997 ; Rodgers &; Brawley, 1991). Specifically, positive and negative outcomes of improved workout performance, as well as negative outcomes directly tied to creatine use are considered. <p> In summary, it is expected that creatine users will have higher self-efficacy with creatine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative outcome expectancies than non-users. In addition, it is expected that social cognitive variables will predict current status as creatine user or non-user. Finally, although no formal hypotheses were tested, descriptive data concerning creatine use patterns, source of information, and use of other performance enhancing dietary supplements was collected in an attempt to further understand creatine use. Method <p> Participants <p> Participants were a convenience sample of 148 male undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at a large mid-Atlantic university, recruited via a research recruitment folder containing a brief description of the study and a sign up sheet. Only students who resistance-trained at least twice a week to improve muscle development, gain strength, or increase muscle mass for non-professional purposes were recruited. Creatine was not mentioned in the recruitment folder. Participants earned extra credit in the psychology classes for participating in the study. Participants were excluded from the study if they did not report any resistance training( n = 2), did not provide complete data( n = 6), or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; i.e., non-recreational goal of resistance training). Participants had a mean age of 19.37( SD = 1.52) and a mean BMI of 24.29( SD = 3.42). Participants were 75% Caucasian. <p> Procedures <p> Participants met for one hour in a classroom to complete an anonymous questionnaire packet. Instructions were read aloud for each of the individual scales within the packet. In addition, the first item of each scale was read aloud, and further clarification was provided if requested. <p> Measures <p> Background information and supplement use. This questionnaire assessed participant age, height, weight, ethnicity, and intercollegiate sports participation. With respect to creatine use, participants were first asked whether or not they had ever heard of creatine. Next, participants were asked to indicate whether or not they had ever used creatine. Those who had used creatine were asked to indicate the duration of use and the number of cycles of use with at least two weeks between periods of use. Participants were then asked to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine). To encourage truthfulness, participants were asked not to report illegal drug-use. Finally, two items assessing source of information asked participants to identify initial source of information about creatine and source of most information about creatine. <p> Self-efficacy. Items assessing SCT variables were preceded by a single item asking participants to indicate how they determine that their workout performance has improved by completing the sentence : " My workout performance would be improved if... " Participants were told to refer to this definition of improved workout performance to aid them in responding to the SCT items. <p> Next, participants were asked to respond to one self-efficacy without creatine item : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance without using creatine... " and two self-efficacy with creatine items : " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance faster by using creatine... " and " How confident am I that I can improve my workout performance even more by using creatine... "( italics in original). Participants responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all confident) to 100( extremely confident). Because participants were allowed to personally define improved workout performance, multiple item self-efficacy scales were not necessary. Previous studies have shown that single item self-efficacy scales are effective for measuring exercise self-efficacy when the attainment is clearly defined( Carboni, Burke, Joyner, Hardy, &; Blom, 2002 ; Clark &; Dodge, 1999 ; Clark &; Nothwehr, 1999 ; Desharnais, Bouillon, &; Godin, 1986 ; Sharpe &; Connell, 1992). <p> Outcome expectancies. Participants responded to three types of outcome expectancy items developed with the aid of qualitative data obtained in a pilot study( Williams &; Anderson, 2000). Positive improved workout expectancies included 17 items reflecting the positive physical, social, and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance. Examples of positive improved workout expectancy items include : " I will increase my muscle strength... " " I will be admired for my physical appearance... " and " I will improve how I feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the negative physical, social, and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from attaining improved workout performance. Examples of negative improved workout expectancy items include : " I will experience unwanted muscle soreness... " " My friends will think I am overly obsessed with weight-lifting... " and " I will discover my performance limitations.... " Finally, Negative creatine use expectancies included 10 items reflecting the negative physical, social and self-evaluative outcomes expected to flow from the use of creatine. Examples of negative creatine use expectancy items include : " I will experience muscle cramps... " " My friends will criticize me... " and " I will feel that I am doing something unnatural to my body... " <p> Participants were asked to rate the " Likelihood " of each outcome on a scale from 0( not at all likely) to 100( extremely likely). Before proceeding to the next item, participants were also asked to rate the " Importance " of each outcome on a scale from 0( not at all important) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, responses to " Likelihood " and " Importance " questions were multiplied, and the resulting products were divided by 100 to yield an item score ranging from 0 to 100. All of the outcome expectancy item scores were subjected to principle axis factoring with oblique rotation to investigate the factor structure of the items. Results yielded three factor-based scales that were consistent with the original grouping of the items. Item scores were then averaged for each scale to yield positive improved workout expectancy( =.91), negative improved workout expectancy( =.86), and negative creatine use expectancy( =.82) scale scores. Data Analyses and Results <p> Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analyses <p> Creatine use. Of 148 participants, 5( 3.4 %) had not heard of creatine, 70( 47.3 %) reported having used creatine at some time, and 78( 52.7 %) reported never having used creatine. Among creatine users 9( 12.9 %) were of minority status, while 28 non-users( 35.9 %) were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20( 28.6 %) had used it for more than 2 months, 30( 42.9 %) for 1 to 2 months, 11( 15.7 %) for 2 to 4 weeks, 7( 10.0 %) for 1 to 2 weeks, and 2( 2.9 %) for less than I week. With respect to cycles of use, 22( 31.4 %) reported 1 cycle, 19( 27.1%) reported 2 cycles, 14( 20.0 %) reported 3 cycles, 3( 4.3 %) reported 4 cycles, and 10( 14.3 %) reported more than 4 cycles. <p> Source of Information. Sources of first knowledge of creatine and most information about creatine across creatine use are shown in Table 1. A majority of both creatine users( n = 48, 70.6 %) and non-users( n = 40, 60.6 %) indicated that friends and family was the first source of knowledge about creatine. The highest number of creatine users( n = 20, 29.4 %) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatine, while the majority of nonusers( n = 37, 55.2 %) said friends and family was the source of most information about creatine. <p> Use of other performance enhancing supplements. Creatine users used more performance enhancing dietary supplements, other than creatine, than non-users, t( 146) = 5.00, p <.001( Table 2). In addition, a larger proportion of creatine users( n = 47, 67.1 %) than non-users( n = 21, 26.9 %) reported previous use of at least one other performance enhancing dietary supplement, /( 1, N = 148) = 22.52, p <.001. Table 3 displays the types of performance enhancing dietary supplements used by creatine users and non-users. Protein/amino acids were the most often used supplements by both creatine users and non-users. Of 11 participants reporting use of DHEA/andro, 10( 90.9 %) were creatine users. <p> Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. Mean ratings for self-efficacy and outcome expectancy variables across creatine use are presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which variables should be included in the logistic regression analysis. Creatine users were significantly higher on self-efficacy with creatine than non-users, t( 146) = 4.98, p <.001. No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for self-efficacy without creatine, t( 146) =.45, p =.657. Creatine users had significantly higher positive improved workout expectancies, t( 146) = 2.37, p =.019, and lower negative creatine use expectancies, t( 146) = 4.90, p <.001, than non-users. No significant differences were found between creatine users and non-users for negative improved workout expectancies, t( 146) =.15, p=.882. <p> Sequential Logistic Regression Analysis <p> Based on the preliminary analyses, self-efficacy with creatine, positive improved workout expectancies, and negative creatine use expectancies were included in a sequential logistic regression analysis to predict status as either creatine user or non-user( Table 4). In accordance with social cognitive theory, self-efficacy with creatine was entered on the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step( Bandura, 1997). Goodness-of-fit indices indicated that the model including the social cognitive variables was a better predictor of creatine use status than the constant-only model both on the first step, /( 1, N = 148) = 22.34, p <.001 ; and the second step, /( 3, N = 148) = 39.24, p <.001, of the analysis. Strength of association for the model is indicated by correlations between predicted group membership based on the model and actual group membership( Tabachnick &; Fidell, 2001, see page 545). The model accounted for 11.6 % of the variance in creatine use status on step one( r =.34), and 25.0 % of the variance in creatine use status on step two( r =.50). <p> The Wald statistic tests each logistic regression coefficient() to determine whether or not each variable contributes uniquely to the model( Table 4). Results indicate that self-efficacy with creatine contributed uniquely to the model on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectancies also contributed uniquely to the model on step two ; however, positive improved workout expectancies did not. For those variables that contribute uniquely to the model, odds ratios provide a more easily interpretable index of the magnitude of each variable 's unique contribution. Prior to calculating odds ratios, the predictor variables were converted to standard scores. Thus, odds ratios reflect the increase/decrease in the odds of creatine use status given a change in one standard deviation in the predictor variable, controlling for all other variables in the model( Table 4). On step one the odds ratio indicated that participants were 2.36 times as likely( 136 % more likely) to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine. On the second step, the odds ratio for self-efficacy with creatine decreased to 1.91, indicating that some of the shared variance between self-efficacy with creatine and creatine use status was also accounted for by the outcome expectancy variables. The odds ratio for negative creatine use expectancies indicated that participants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in negative creatine use expectancies. Discussion <p> Consistent with SCT, creatine users had stronger beliefs in personal ability to enhance performance through creatine use. In addition, participants were 2.36 times as likely to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in self-efficacy with creatine. Self-efficacy with creatine continued to be a significant predictor of creatine use status after the outcome expectancy variables were added to the model, thus supporting the notion that self-efficacy continues to be a strong predictor even after outcome expectancies are controlled( Bandura, 1997). Creatine non-users did not have higher self-efficacy without creatine than creatine users. Instead, mean values for self-efficacy without creatine were high for both groups, suggesting that participants were all fairly confident that they could improve personal workout performance without creatine. <p> Negative creatine use expectancies had the strongest relationship with creatine use status among the outcome expectancy variables. Creatine users expected fewer negative outcomes from using creatine and deemed those outcomes less important than non-creatine users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome expectancies, participants were less than half as likely( Odds Ratio =.45) to be a creatine user for each standard deviation increase in negative creatine use expectancies. Moreover, the increase in explained variance from step 1 to step 2 indicates that outcome expectancies explained unique variance in creatine use that was not accounted for by self-efficacy. Creatine users expected more positive outcomes as a result of improved workout performance and valued those outcomes more than non-creatine users. However, positive improved workout expectancies were not a significant predictor of creatine use status when self-efficacy and negative outcome expectancies were controlled. Finally, negative improved workout expectancies were not related to creatine use status. Instead, the mean for this variable was relatively low across all participants indicating that resistance trainers do not expect many negative outcomes of improved workout performance. <p> Descriptive results indicate pervasive exposure to creatine in this population as evidenced by the percentage of those who had heard of creatine( 96.6 %) and the rate of use( 47.3 %). In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male, undergraduate, recreational resistance-trainers participated in varsity high school sports and obtained information about creatine from athletic trainers( Williams &; Anderson, 2000), the present data suggest that information about creatine is more often obtained through friends and family or through magazines than through professionals such as athletic trainers. Information gleaned from these sources may become distorted or exaggerated leading consumers to make decisions about creatine use that are not based in fact. Exaggerated claims of the effectiveness of creatine may indirectly affect creatine use by influencing self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. Finally, creatine users had used more performance enhancing supplements than non-creatine users, and more creatine users than non-users reported previous use of more harmful supplements, namely DHEA and andro( King et al., 1999). <p> The present study lays the groundwork for the understanding of performance enhancing dietary supplement use from a theoretical, social cognitive perspective. Results suggest that SCT variables are useful in differentiating between creatine users and non-users. However, interpretations based on the sequential logistic regression analysis must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Although social cognitive variables are theorized to determine future behavior, current self-efficacy judgments and outcome expectancies are based in part on past behavior( Bandura, 1997) ; therefore, to more clearly understand how self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and information sources influence behavior( i.e., creatine use), longitudinal designs are preferred. Moreover, the use of a convenience sample in the present study limits the generalizability of the findings. Research employing random and broader sampling( e.g., high school students, college graduates, and female resistance trainers) is needed to understand how SCT operates to influence creatine use in these populations. Finally, as the market for dietary supplements continues to grow, more research is needed that examines theoretical determinants of a wide range of supplement use, including more harmful performance enhancing drugs.
