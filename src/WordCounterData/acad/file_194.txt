4088441 Street-level and rooftop( three-story building) concentrations of particulate matter? 2.5 m in diameter( PMsub2.5) were measured in downtown Trujillo, Peru, in July and August 2003 to determine the PMsub2.5 concentration reduction on days with normal traffic conditions( 32 days) versus a day when motor vehicles were temporarily banned from the downtown district( 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., July 15) known as El Dia Sin Autos( " The Day Without Cars "). The mean 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. street-level PMsub2.5 concentration during the motor vehicle ban( 21.4 ug/m ; one day) was 49% lower than when vehicles were not impeded( 42.2 7.8 g/m - mean 1 standard deviation ; 20 days). The rooftop monitoring station indicated a 20% decrease in PMsub2.5 concentrations( 24.82.6 g/m vs. 19.9 6.0 g/m) when motor vehicles were not present within historic downtown Trujillo. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed during the motor vehicle ban and during normal traffic were not significantly different( p &gt;.05). </p> Introduction The World Health Organization( WHO) estimates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor air pollution above the maximum recommended limits( World Health Organization WHO, 1999). Air pollution, a variety of particles and gases produced either directly or indirectly from fossil fuel combustion, is a major environmental health problem present within an array of urban and rural settings in both developed and developing nations. Although industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential sectors have been identified as contributors of ambient air pollution in developing countries( Reinhardt, Ottmar, &; Castilla, 2001 ; Shendall &; Naeher, 2002 ; Smith, 1993 ; Xianglu et al., 2005 ; Xianglu &; Naeher, 2006), multiple studies have shown that the transportation sector is a major if not the primary source of certain air pollutants within urban areas, particularly within Latin American cities( Instituto Nacional de Estadstica Geogragica, &; Lopez-Salinas, 2005). Multiple emission inventories have suggested that motor vehicles are the principal contributor of fine particulate matter or PMsub25( particles with an aerodynamic diameter? 2.5 m) to the atmosphere in urban areas( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Transport, 2002 ; Economopoulou &; Economopoulous, 2002 ; Schauer et al, 1996), which is positively correlated with morbidity and mortality, particularly among people with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases( Dockery et al., 1993 ; Health Effects Institute, 2001 ; WHO, 2000). Increased health risks are associated with decreasing distances to traffic motorways( Brunekreef et al., 1997 ; Van Vliet et al., 1997), and particulates generated from combustion processes, especially diesel exhaust particulates, are more toxic and often result in more exacerbated health effects than those from noncombustion processes( Bernstein et al., 2004 ; Brunekreef et al., 1997 ; Van Vliet et al, 1997). Furthermore, studies have also shown improved respiratory health in children when ambient air pollution levels decline( Bayer-Oglesby et al., 2005). </p> While many air pollution source-identification studies derive their results from either particulate matter speciation or modeling to determine the amount attributable to motor vehicles, current research shows a data gap in natural experiments measuring air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from the urban environment. The objective of our study was to measure street-level and rooftop-level PMsub2.5 concentrations in historic downtown Trujillo, Peru, in order to determine the difference in PMsub2.5 corresponding to a period where motor vehicles were temporarily banned from the historic downtown area and also during normal traffic conditions. The temporary ban on all types of motor vehicles within historic downtown Trujillo known as El Dia Sin Autos or " The Day Without Cars " was an attempt by the local municipal government to expose the general population to a motor vehicle exhaust-free zone and to promote a decreased reliance on motor vehicles in the hopes of gaining support for the local government 's clean air agenda. </p> Methods Study Location Trujillo, Peru, is an arid, coastal city of 732,000 people located just west of the foothills of the Andes Mountains. Trujillo 's historic downtown is located in the center of downtown Trujillo and encompasses all of the area inside Avenida Espaa, an oval-shaped road 1,350 m long and 850 m wide. Historic downtown Trujillo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nacional de Trujillo, 2003) regularly resulting in pedestrian and motor vehicle congestion during the local rush hours( 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. ; 7:00 p.m. to 9 p.m.). An established local ordinance prohibits the entry of any bus or public transportation van( primarily diesel-fueled) within the Avenida Espaa perimeter resulting in a downtown primarily populated by taxis. Over 6,900 taxis( mean age =11 years) were registered within Trujillo in 2003, 62% of which use gasoline and 38% of which use diesel fuel( Trujillo City Hall, 2003). In 2000 most of Trujillo 's registered motor vehicle fleet of 53,614 units were not equipped with any emission control system and the average public transportation vehicle age was 19 years old( Trujillo City Hall, 2003 ; Trujillo Public Transportation Union, 2003). </p> Air Monitoring Locations On July 15, 2003, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., no motor vehicles were allowed in the Avenida Espaa perimeter surrounding historic downtown Trujillo for the inaugural El Dia Sin Autos( " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected as the central monitoring location due to its location within historic downtown Trujillo and its security. Trujillo City Hall is located as close as 430 m to Avenida Espaa to the south and far as 850 m away to the northeast. A real-time PMsub2.5 aerosol monitor was positioned at street level outside of a City Hall window 2 m from the closest traffic lane starting on " The Day Without Cars "( July 15, 2003) and it continued monitoring for the subsequent 20 days when traffic flow was not banned. Two monitoring stations containing both real-time and gravimetric PMsub25 instruments were previously established on July 3 and continuously ran until August 4 capturing days of unimpeded traffic before and after " The Day Without Cars. " One station was located on the roof of the three-story City Hall building directly above the street-level monitor. The second station was located in a rural area 9 km west of downtown at the Trujillo airport( Cassidy Naeher, Villalobos, Ryan, &; Bayer, 2004). The airport monitoring station was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the source of meteorological data utilized in our study. Hourly weather data was collected daily by airport employees from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. </p> Pollutants Measured and Equipment Description Real-time PMsub25 levels were measured using DustTrak aerosol monitors. At the end of the sampling period all of the aerosol monitors utilized in the study were run in parallel for 12 hours atop Trujillo City Hall to establish a concentration coefficient to adjust for inter-instrumentation variation. Previous studies have shown that DustTrak aerosol monitors ' concentration readings differ depending on the type of PM being sampled( Macintosh, Williams, &; Yanosky 2002 ; Volckens, Boundy Leith, &; Hands, 1999). Assuming that gravimetric PMsub25 measurements are more representative to the actual PMsub25 concentration, the real-time PMsub25 concentrations were adjusted according to 24-hour average gravimetric concentrations measured beside the DustTrak atop City Hall from July 3 to August 4 to increase comparability between the two sampling methods. </p> Twenty-four-hour time-integrated PMsub25 samples were collected using 37 mm Teflon filters, KTL PMsub25 cyclones, and SKC universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 0C during storage and shipment. Filters were allowed to equilibrate for a 48 hour period at 20.61.4C, 56.19% relative humidity in a filter chamber prior to the weighing of the filters. Each filter was weighed at least twice before and twice after sampling using a Cahn C-35 microbalance to ensure the measured weights were within 5 g. All measurements were performed as outlined in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's( U.S. EPA 's) Quality Assurance Guidance Document( U.S. Environmental Protection Agency U.S. EPA, 1998). Air densities during weighing sessions, nominal densities of calibration masses, and control filters were used to adjust the balance readings for the buoyancy effect of air( Koistinen, Kousa, Virpi, Hanninen, &; Jantunen, 1999). </p> Results The mean 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. street-level PMsub25 concentrations with and without motor vehicles present were, respectively, 42.2 7.8 g/m( mean 1 standard deviation, n = 20 days) and 21.4 g/m( n = 1 day). Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test indicated a normal distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present( p =.0201). T-tests measuring the difference of means between the samples with and without cars were not possible due to the single sample collected without motor vehicles. Knowing that the 20 samples with motor vehicles present were normally distributed, however, one could use the empirical rule to estimate the sample distribution. The 21.4 g/m mean concentration without motor vehicles was 2.83 standard deviations from the mean PMsub25 concentration with motor vehicles( 42.2 7.8 g/m). According to the empirical rule, 2.83 standard deviations from the mean PMsub25 concentration with motor vehicles present would include 99.5% of all samples in a normally distributed sample. Although unable to statistically test a difference of means due to the low sample size, this distribution indicates a potentially strong PMsub25 concentration difference among the samples with and without motor vehicles. </p> Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the real-time PMsub2.5 concentrations at street level and atop the City Hall roof, respectively, during the samples with and without motor vehicles. When motor vehicles were not present between 8:00 a.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 49% lower( 21.4 g/m vs. 42.2 7.8 g/m) and were 18% lower at the rooftop( 19.9 g/m vs. 24.4 1.9 g/m). </p> The difference between the 24-hour mean street-level and rooftop-level PMsub25 concentrations during the motor vehicle ban was less than 2 g/m. The 24-hour mean PMsub25 concentrations were 47% higher at street level( 44.0 6.6 g/m) than on the rooftop( 29.8 2.7 g/m), however, throughout the 20 day sampling period. Both street-level and rooftop PMsub25 concentrations followed a diurnal pattern where PMsub25 concentrations were lowest during the afternoon( average high temperature of 21C) when most pollution sources were active and were consistently higher during the night( average low temperature of 14C) when pollution sources were more scarce. This trend suggests a potential nocturnal inversion effect. </p> The mean 24-hour gravimetric PMsub25 concentrations measured on the roof of City Hall throughout the entire sampling period had an average of 36.19.2 g/m( n = 32 days) while the mean 24-hour period containing " The Day Without Cars " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned for only 10 of the 24 hours of sampling, however, therefore weakening this comparison. </p> Discussion Since sunlight is a driving force in the creation of ocean breezes, daytime temperatures were highly correlated with wind speed( r =.978 ; p =.000). Since both temperature and wind increase atmospheric mixing and pollution dilution in either a horizontal or vertical direction PMsub25 concentrations were inversely related to both wind speed( r = -.837 ; p =.000) and temperature( r = -.763 ; p =.001). This indicates that the particle dilution rate increased as the ocean breezes and temperatures became more intense during the afternoon and decreased as the wind speeds and temperature declined at night, resulting in less atmospheric mixing and increased pollution concentrations. The high correlation between temperature and wind speed may result in a confounding effect, however, in which the significant association between PMsub25 concentrations and weather phenomena may not be as attributable as stated. </p> In order to determine if the decrease in PMsub25 concentrations on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather phenomenon, meteorological data collected at the airport and downtown monitoring stations were analyzed to determine if a significant change occurred in the weather during the " Day Without Cars " compared to the remainder of the sampling period. The meteorological data collected at the downtown monitoring station( temperature) and 9 km away at the airport( temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed) did not significantly differ among the two data sets. </p> The " Day Without Cars " natural experiment presented multiple variables for which we could not prepare or control due to time and personnel constraints. First, the motor vehicle densities on and outside of Avenida Espaa were not recorded during the " Day Without Cars. " Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the nearby motor vehicle density outside of historic downtown Trujillo was similar on days with and without the motor vehicle ban. The traffic ban within historic downtown Trujillo may have potentially increased the motor vehicle density on and just outside Avenida Espaa due to rerouted traffic resulting in a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second, we were unaware of " The Day Without Cars " until just prior to the event. Therefore, ground-level PMsub25 data was not collected prior to " The Day Without Cars. " The use of concentrations prior to and after July 15 would have been useful in determining if an increasing or decreasing trend occurred in pollution concentrations over time. The measurements on top of the City Hall building, however, which included 12 days before and 20 days after " The Day Without Cars, " indicated that the pollution concentrations were relatively constant. Finally, the main limitation of this study was the short period without motor vehicles present, limiting the amount of data that could be collected in the 10-hour motor vehicle ban. </p> Conclusion Since multiple variables could not be controlled in the analysis, it is impossible to state with absolute confidence the percent difference in PMsub2.5 concentration due to the absence of motor vehicles within historic downtown Trujillo. The data do suggest that the removal of motor vehicles from historic downtown Trujillo results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of PMsub25 concentration at roof level. The greater reduction in PMsub25 concentrations at street-level opposed to that on the City Hall rooftop is potentially due to the proximity of the equipment to motor vehicles as well as the fact that a larger portion of the rooftop 's pollutants derive from sources outside of Avenida Espaa, which were less affected by the motor vehicle ban. The decreased PMsub25 concentrations measured when motor vehicles were banned from historic downtown Trujillo suggests that motor vehicles are a major source of particulate pollution within the area. The Trujillo local government has been informed of the study results, and Trujillo has observed a " Day Without Cars " in the historic downtown area every year since 2003. </p> Acknowlegements : This study was funded in part by the International Society for Exposure Analysis/American Chemistry Council Early Career Award ; UGA, Biomedical Health Sciences Institute and Office of International Agriculture ; Asociacion del Aire Ambiental, Lima, Peru ; Trujillo City Hall.
