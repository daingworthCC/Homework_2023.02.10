4015841 Abstract <p> We conducted a test of the efficacy of ciprofloxacin eardrops in 80 patients( 95 ears) with otorrhea due to chronic suppurative otitis media in two treatment settings. One group( n=40 ; 47 ears) received daily ciprofloxacin therapy plus aspiration in the clinic. The other group( n=40 ; 48 ears) self-administered ciprofloxacin at home. Overall, otorrhea resolved in 88% of all ears within 12 days of the initiation of treatment. The clinic-treated patients tended to respond more rapidly than did the self-treated patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in success rates between the two groups. Side effects were negligible. We conclude that empiric topical ciprofloxacin therapy is an effective, safe and relatively inexpensive treatment for otorrhea in patients with chronic otitis media. Introduction <p> Preoperative antimicrobial treatment for otorrhea in patients undergoing surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media( SOM) has been shown to prevent complications.( n1, n2) Topical therapy may be a better choice than systemic therapy because it produces fewer side effects( especially ototoxicity), and it is less expensive.( n3-n5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as effective as, and often more effective than, systemic treatment.( n6, n7) <p> The ideal ototopical agent should demonstrate effective antimicrobial activity against the most common pathogens, and it should be non-ototoxic, especially in children.( n8) Ciprofloxacin( Cipro), a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterials, is particularly effective against gram-negative organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.( n1, n5, n8) In children, use of the topical formulation is recommended in order to avert the side effects associated with the systemic drug.( n1) Materials and Methods <p> We investigated the efficacy of topical ciprofloxacin in 80 patients( 45 male and 35 female), aged 21 months to 70 years( mean 26.5 years), who came to our clinic with otorrhea of at least six weeks ' duration between March and September of 1994. In 15 patients, the otorrhea was bilateral. Otic fluid was obtained from each patient and sent for culture. Audiographic testing was performed on all patients before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups of 40. One group( 47 ears) returned to the clinic on a daily basis to undergo external ear channel aspiration and to receive an application of ciprofloxacin lactate solution administered by clinic personnel ; treatment continued until the otorrhea resolved. The second group( 48 ears) underwent aspiration and topical ciprofloxacin treatment only during the first clinic visit, after which the patients self-administered the ciprofloxacin at home. The self-treated patients were asked to return to the clinic as soon as their otorrhea resolved. The dosage for both groups was 2 mg/ml : two administrations of three drops each for patients younger than 15 years, and two applications of five drops each for older patients. Clinic personnel and patients were instructed to wait five minutes between the two applications. Statistical results were analyzed using the q test. Results <p> Need for Surgery <p> During the course of the treatment regimen, four of the 95 ears( 4%) required radical mastoidectomy, and five ears( 5%) underwent polypectomy. One patient with bilateral otorrhea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an additional six weeks. <p> Causative Pathogens <p> The most common isolates on culture were S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp( Table 1). Cultures isolated a single type of microorganism in 76 of the 80 patients( 95%) ; there was mixed growth in the remainder. Two of the 15 patients with bilateral otorrhea had different pathogens in each ear. Bacteria isolated from 92 of the 95 ears were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin ; partial susceptibility was seen in the other three ears. No bacteria were completely resistant to ciprofloxacin. These findings suggest that in these cases, cultures are not necessary before initiating topical ciprofloxacin treatment. <p> Clinic-treated Patients <p> Otorrhea resolved in three to eight days in 43 of the 47 clinic-treated ears( 91%) ; treatment failed in the other four ears( Table 2). Two of the treatment failures occurred in the patients who underwent radical mastoidectomy and polypectomy after they were diagnosed with cholesteatoma. <p> Self-treated Patients <p> Topical ciprofloxacin was successful in 41 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difference in the success rates between the two groups was not statistically significant( p <0.05). The time to resolution for the self-treated patients who responded to therapy ranged from five to 12 days( Table 2). The seven patients in whom treatment failed had still not responded after 15 days of therapy ; microscopic examination revealed cholesteatomas in three ears and middle ear polypoid hypertrophy in one ear. The three patients with cholesteatoma underwent modified radical mastoidectomy. <p> Overall Assessment <p> Topical ciprofloxacin was successful in 84 of the 95 infected ears( 88%). There were no differences in pre- and post-treatment audiographic results or bone conduction in either group. Otomycosis developed in four ears( 4%) between post-treatment days 15 and 20. One self-treated patient complained of dizziness, which we attributed to the fact that the medication was stored in a refrigerator between uses. <p> Follow-up <p> Patients were followed for three to six months. Relapse occurred in six ears in the clinic-treated group( 12.8%) and in five ears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered after an additional course of ciprofloxacin. Discussion <p> Most studies have shown that the same types of microoorganisms are isolated from the ears of patients with chronic SOM. The most common bacteria are S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp, Klebsiella spp and Escherichia coli.( n3, n10-n14) These findings were borne out in our study( Table 1). <p> Otorrhea in chronic SOM is often difficult to cure because of bacterial resistance and because of the failure of systemic antimicrobials to penetrate the chronically inflamed otic tissues.( n3, n9, n10) The systemic aminoglycosides are highly effective in eradicating most gram-negative bacteria, but their ototoxic side effects discourage their use in patients with chronic SOM.( n3-n5) As a result, clinicians have turned to topical agents, including neomycin, cortisone, gentamicin -- alone or in combination with acidic solutions such as boric acid.( n9, n15) <p> For all their benefits, some topical agents do have their drawbacks. For example, just as an acidic medium is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n16) it has been proposed that local application of ototoxic drugs may have a similar effect.( n3-n5) Moreover, some topical solutions are reported to cause some abnormal alterations in the middle ear mucosa and the tympanic membane. However, Barlow et al, in their study of the quinolone derivative oflaxacin, found that its effect on the middle ear mucosa and the tympanic membrane was no different from that of 0.9% isotonic sodium chloride solution.( n8) <p> For pediatric patients with chronic SOM, Harvey et al report that topical drug therapy and aspiration is preferable to surgery.( n17) While both systemic and topical ciprofloxacin are used in the treatment of chronic SOM, the systemic form of the drug is contraindicated in children because of its possible degenerative effects on cartilage.( n3, n5, n6, n9, n13, n18) Moreover, systemic therapy is five times more expensive than topical treatment.( n1) <p> The safety of topical ciprofloxacin was demonstrated in two animal trials. Bagger-Sjoback et al treated guinea pigs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any complications in inner ear or vestibulary organs.( n11) Brownlee et al treated guinea pigs with topical ciprofloxacin and found that it did not cause hair cell loss in their inner ears.( n19) <p> In humans, both systemic and topical ciprofloxacin have been shown to be non-ototoxic.( n17, n20) Esposito et al found that ciprofloxacin is more effective than systemic aminoglycosides.( n3) These researchers earlier suggested that the topical formulation of ciprofloxacin is more effective in treating chronic SOM than is the oral form, especially in malignant otitis externa caused by P. aeruginosa, which is most often seen in diabetic patients.( n6) Lang et al used oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin in 21 children and reported that the drug caused no cartilage damage ; the only adverse effect they reported was one case of neutropenia.( n13) Ganz reported an 84% success rate with topical ciprofloxacin, and concluded that it was more effective than Systemic therapy.( n7) <p> In our study, we observed that topical treatment combined with local aspiration and cleansing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Aykut et al, who concluded that " aspiration and local purification is more important than the type of used drugs. "( n9) In our study, immediate side effects were limited to one case of dizziness, which we believe was related to the between-use storage of the drug in a cold environment. Five patients developed otomycosis after drug therapy had been stopped for a minimum of two weeks. Although otomycosis is an important complication, it was easily managed with vinegar irrigation. Otomycosis secondary to topical ciprofloxacin has also been reported by Piccirillo and Pames.( n5) These findings point to the need for careful follow-up monitoring during the weeks following the cessation of therapy. Our finding that there were no differences in audiographic results before and after treatment are consistent with those of other studies. <p> The relapse rate we observed during the three to six months of follow-up( 11.5%) was rather high, but we attribute much of this to insufficient protection of the ears by our patients, such as during swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessary to culture fluid from every ear with otorrhea. Empiric therapy with topical ciprofloxacin is sufficient. Topical therapy is an effective, safe and relatively inexpensive treatment for chronic SOM. Culturing and microscopic examination of the ear is indicated only if otorrhea persists after 15 days of drug therapy. Table 1. Microorganisms Isolated from 95 Ears with Chronic SOM.
