4010741 The community college, at its best, can be a center for problem-solving in adult illiteracy or the education of the disabled. It can be a center for leadership training, too. It can also be the place where education and business leaders meet to talk about the problems of displaced workers. It can bring together agencies to strengthen services for minorities, working women, single parent heads of households, and unwed teenage parents. It can coordinate efforts to provide day care, transportation, and financial aid. The community college can take the lead in long-range planning for community development. And it can serve as the focal point for improving the quality of life in the inner city. <p> We are convinced that, as we move toward the year 2000, strengthening connections beyond the college -- with schools, industry, business, social agencies, and policy groups -- will become a key strategy in the building of community.( Boyer &; Peltason, 1988, p. 41) <p> Perhaps no subject within the community college arena has sparked as much interest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-indexed to the keywords community colleges and economic development in the ERIC database between 1982 and September, 1993. Most presidential position descriptions specifically cite expertise in economic development as a qualification, and many community college mission statements formally include involvement in economic development as a priority. But what do we mean when we use the term economic development? This ERIC review examines the role of community colleges in economic development and provides a general review of the literature. It specifically focuses on the roles of rural, suburban, and urban community colleges and examines three topic issues : technology transfer ; employment, training, and literacy programs ; and economic impact studies. Overview <p> The role of the community college in economic development is a subject of long-standing debate. This debate directly rises from strong disagreements extending over six decades on the vocational-technical function of the community college. Many critics have long held the view that overemphasizing vocationalism and tracking to terminal nontransfer degrees has injured students( Brint &; Karabel, 1990). The strong bias of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper role of community colleges in the arena of economic development( even though the dramatic increase in vocational transfers in states like California may prove to make this argument irelevant). Furthermore, most of the general literature on economic development strategies that drives political theory and policy -- be it of liberal or conservative bent -- is authored by economists, political scientists, and sociologists. Based at research universities and think tanks, these scholars typically have never attended or worked in a community college ; and they possess a relatively low understanding of the great diversity among the states in legally assigned missions. They do not have a working knowledge of the powerful internal culture of the institution( for example, the strong bias toward involvement in " hard dollar " FTE-funded activities among community college business officers). <p> This reality clearly has significant policy implications ; any meaningful review of the literature of community colleges and economic development must start from this point. For community college practitioners to be active in influencing welfare reform and employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have a sense of some of the key reports that are driving policy formation and implementation. These publications lie outside traditional community college publication outlets ; information on how to obtain them is specifically included in this ERIC review. <p> Within the world of community colleges, great variability exists among the states in terms of assigned missions, functions, and governance of community colleges( Fountain &; Tollefson, 1989), as well as methods of finance( Honeyman, Williamson, &; Wattenbarger, 1991). What is acceptable in one state may be prohibited or assigned to another institution or set of institutions elsewhere. Katsinas and Lacey( 1989) distinguished between traditional and nontraditional economic development community college initiatives. They characterized traditional initiatives as the vocational and occupational curriculums at community colleges designed to produce technicians to support a largely manufacturing-based economy.( These programs were terminal and nontransfer-based -- the very programs that critics of community colleges have castigated as tracking students from low socioeconomic backgrounds toward lesser careers and futures.) Katsinas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature, typically aimed at the jobs of an information age. They found that community colleges were operating small business incubation centers, technology transfer training centers, office automation centers, demographic and economic research, customized training for business and industry, employment and training programs within inner cities, and programs to train business professionals to export to international markets. <p> Cohen and Brawer( 1989) contended that most authorizing legislation at the state level for curricular functions usually included academic transfer preparation, vocational-technical education, continuing education, remedial education, and community service : " Every book written about the institution... has also articulated these elements "( p. 16). Katsinas and Lacey 's characterization of community college involvement in economic development initiatives included all of these curricular functions except the academic transfer preparation function. Traditional economic development initiatives are largely subsumed in the vocational-technical as well as remedial functions. <p> Nontraditional economic development activities are subsumed in the community services function and( to a lesser extent) in the continuing education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consistent with the view advocated in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Community Colleges( Boyer &; Peltason, 1988). Raymond J. Young noted that, <p> The community services dimension of the community college function derives its legitimacy as does the institution itself from its educational role.... Community services are legitimate only to the extent to which they represent an extension or expansion of the educational resources directed toward the economic, social, cultural, and civic needs of the people the college serves. The college can not always be a " prime mover " for change, and its role may often be a coordinative or supportive one. It will sometimes need to assume a " partnership " role in reference to personal and community development.... <p> The community services program, by drawing upon its role as college-community liaison and catalyst, can provide the impetus needed for the college to focus on institutional redirection, so part of its impact will be to make the community a better one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Literature Reviews <p> Two fairly extensive reviews of the literature would be of particular value to readers interested in learning more about the subject. Part Two of Katsinas and Lacey 's monograph( 1989, pp. 13-25) presents a review of the literature related to trends and forces motivating community college involvement in nontraditional economic development. A paper by Jim Palmer, former Vice President of Communications for the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges( now the American Association of Community Colleges or AACC), presents a thorough content analysis of the many activities in which community colleges are involved in the economic development arena( Palmer, 1990). <p> It is important to note that much of the literature on economic development and community colleges consists of self-reported examples of successful institutional programs, which typically are written up as case studies. The case studies of community college efforts. to stabilize or diversify the economic base of their communities reported by Margaret Thomas in a study for the Midwest Research Institute( 1989) were not self-reported, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thomas presented 20 diverse examples of programs at suburban, urban, and rural community colleges from 16 different states across the nation. In the final section of their work, Katsinas and Lacey summarized factors that led to success in nontraditional economic development ; they noted that access to the chief executive officer was of particular importance( 1989). Palmer provided a 36-entry annotated bibliography of key issues as well as a listing of 25 selected doctoral dissertations on the subject( 1990). <p> Another general work of note, Economic Development : Strategies for Collaboration( Ryan, 1993), provides readers with a useful overview of practical problems that community colleges face in partnering with businesses and labor unions and in obtaining federal funding. The two-year college model programs cited in Productive America, a study sponsored by the National Council of Occupational Education( NCOE) and the AACC, also would be useful to practitioners contemplating new programs( Martinez &; Smith, 1990). The NCOE and AACC case studies include critical factors and barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community Colleges and Economic Development <p> Rural economic development has long been of interest to policymakers at state and federal levels. Beyond the world of community colleges, the U.S. Department of Agriculture( USDA) has been involved formally in rural economic development for many decades. In more recent years, the USDA has supported four regional rural consortia based at university cooperative extension offices( Northeast, North-Central, Southern, and Western) that have provided newsletters, hosted annual regional conferences, and funded small grant programs on rural economic development.( Mailings are free, and information can be obtained from the cooperative extension service attached to the college of agriculture at the land grant university in the relevant state). <p> The finest report this author has reviewed on the subject of rural economic development that can be applied to community colleges is Shadows in the Sunbelt : Development of the Rural South in an Era of Economic Change, written for the Southern Growth Policies Board( Winter, 1986, available through MDC, Inc., P.O. Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Former Mississippi Governor William F. Winter, who served a term on the Board of Directors of the AACC, chaired this panel, which produced three key conclusions : The traditional sources of wealth in the rural South-such as extractive industries, agriculture, and textiles -- are in decline, and the South no longer enjoys a competitive advantage in selling " low wages " in a globally competitive market. Continued emphasis on industrial recruitment, the traditional southern economic development strategy, is inappropriate in the information age. " The great buffalo hunt is over, " the report said, noting that about 10,000 industrial development authorities were chasing after only 1,400 new plant sites each year( p. 10-11). Alternative strategies, including industrial retention and expansion of existing industries, workforce skill upgrading, workplace literacy and entrepreneurship, are more appropriate long-term growth strategies. <p> Other general research that focuses upon persistent rural poverty and the failure to account for rural needs in the development of federal and state policy includes two recently published books, Persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1993) and Forgotten Places : Uneven Development in Rural America( Lyson &; Falk, 1993). Additionally, a briefing paper by Mishel and Teixeira for the Economic Policy Institute discusses the myth of the coming labor shortage in rural areas( 1991). Much of the available research centers around barriers to economic development in rural areas. Robert B. Reich, now President Clinton 's Secretary of Labor, cited four key barriers to economic development : lack of access to transportation, communications, technology extension, and worker training and retraining( Reich, 1988). Reich 's views on policy were directly tied to practical suggestions for alternative rural economic development strategies, including entrepreneurship development and the promotion of small manufacturing enterprises as described in Shadows in the Sunbelt( Winter, 1986). <p> To provide a forum for discussing related institutional issues, the Commission on Small-Rural Colleges of the AACC was formed in 1979. Their 1988 report, Small-Rural Community Colleges, included the results from a survey of about 600 small rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or 200 institutions, responded ; half of those " allied themselves with the economic development efforts of their communities "( p. 10). Forty-six percent included economic development as part of their institutional mission statements. One striking result was that nearly 90% of the responding community colleges indicated they offered job-specific training to new or expanding industries( p. 10). This report also included a section on adult literacy, high school and community college partnerships, civic partnerships, and a very useful section on uses of technology that provided a compendium of noteworthy practice. The 1988 report was followed up by a 1993 compendium of effective practice reported under the four categories of entrepreneurship and new business development, technology deployment, industrial recruitment and retention, and partnerships with business and industry( Esbeck, 1993). <p> Readers interested in learning more about specific institutional practice are advised to consult Palmer 's report for the AACC( 1990), and Thomas 's report for the Midwest Policy Institute( 1989), as well as Katsinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies of rural community college involvement in customized training at Lake Michigan College in Michigan, small business incubation at Pueblo Community College in Colorado, and technology transfer partnership at Gadsden State Community College in Alabama. Suburban Community Colleges and Economic Development <p> During the past twenty years, the suburban areas of the United States have seen the greatest population and job growth. Noted demographer and political scientist William Schneider wrote that the 1992 elections were the first in American history in which the majority of voters came from the suburbs( Schneider, 1992). It appears that the most prominent role suburban community colleges play is to provide continuing education and skill upgrading for workers currently employed, as opposed to providing training to bring new workers into the labor force for the first time or after long disassociation with the labor force. This is likely due to the higher educational attainment levels found among people living in the nation 's suburbs. Customized training, therefore, is probably the most important role suburban community colleges play. <p> Doucette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community College examined customized workforce training programs at community colleges. In surveying 1,042 community colleges, with a response rate of 73%, the survey found that nearly all of the responding institutions( 96%) were providing workforce training programs. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds were providing training for companies with fewer than 500 employees, the fastest growing part of the manufacturing sector. This report also included policy recommendations regarding workforce training for community college leaders as well as corporate executives( Doucette, 1993). <p> Katsinas and Lacey 's case study of customized training at Lake Michigan College also applies to community colleges contemplating the development of customized training programs, and a New Directions in Community Colleges monograph edited by Kopecek and Clarke( 1984) provides good information on initiating customized training programs at community colleges. The directory of campus-business linkages in Part II of the Guide to Campus-Business Linkage Programs( Fenwick, Giorgio, Kopecky, Lloyd, &; Myers, 1986), also may be useful to practitioners. Urban Community Colleges and Economic Development <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional community college publications. Much of this literature centers around the role of the federal government in employment and training programs, as well as welfare policy. One of the more provocative works of the past 10 years has been William Julius Wilson 's The Truly Disadvantaged( 1986). Wilson served with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the William T. Grant Foundation Commission on Work, Family and Citizenship. The Forgotten Half : Non-College Youth in America, an interim report on the school-to-work transition, proposed apprenticeship programs and other alternative efforts( Howe, 1988). <p> A number of publications within the community college literature have made a strong case for programming for non-college-bound youth at community colleges. Dale Parnell 's The Neglected Majority( 1985) provides perhaps the strongest testimony. In 1989, Who Cares About the Inner City? The Community College Response to Urban America was published by the Commission on Urban Community Colleges of the AACC( Weidenthal, 1989). This report documented the efforts of 10 urban community college districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with governmental agencies including local welfare and housing departments, outreach programs for minorities, partnerships with the public schools and senior universities, and partnerships with business and industry. The listing of innovative programs is particularly useful to readers interested in replicating similar programs at their institutions. Weidenthal found that traditional credit programming and the financial burdens of serving inner city urban areas are " sizeable... and must be recognized and dealt with "( p. 23). Interestingly, Weidenthal concluded that, <p> The emerging mission and role of central city campuses continues to be misunderstood in their own communities. There is a sense of frustration concerning public understanding and acceptance of the social and educational roles of these colleges. Indeed, negative image and perception consistently plague central city campuses.... <p> There appears to be no national consensus on the multiple mission and roles of the central city campus and its special programs that reach out to the community. It appears that each campus and each district is dealing with urban issues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and complex institutions, urban community colleges are involved in a myriad of activities ; and, as Weidenthal points out, no consensus has been reached on which activities are appropriate for their involvement. A number of urban community colleges have established technology transfer centers as described below, while others have been involved in small business incubation centers, customized training for business and industry, and even research related to demographic and economic development.( The AACC Urban Colleges Project publishes a newsletter entitled The Urban Report ; readers interested in subscribing should contact Bud Weidenthal, Director, AACC Urban Colleges Project, 4250 Richmond Road, Cleveland, Ohio, 44122.) Technology Transfer and Community Colleges <p> Many mainstream economists, including Robert Reich and Lester Thurow, believe that an important key to building wealth in the 1990s will be the relative success or failure of small to medium manufacturers( SMEs). Doug Ross, writing policy suggestions for the incoming Clinton Administration in January of 1993 noted that, " Many of the nation 's 360,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having great difficulty keeping up with the pace of technological change on their own "( 1993, p. 75). <p> The role of community colleges in technology transfer was recognized by the Southern Growth Policies Board( SGPB) when it created the Southern Technology Council( STC) in December of 1984. The STC served as a forum to show southern states how to get beyond traditional industrial recruitment strategies for economic development( Southern Technology Council, 1987). Readers interested in initiating their own technology transfer centers are well advised to consult the work of Stuart Rosenfeld, perhaps the leading author in this field. Rosenfeld 's 1992 book, Competitive Manufacturing -- New Strategies for Regional Development, provides an excellent contextual overview of his decade of work as director of the STC and his current activities as president of Regional Technology Strategies( RTS), a nonprofit firm located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Rosenfeld has long advocated developing " renaissance technicians " at community colleges as a key component to economic development in the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachian Resource Commission and Tennessee Valley Authority, the Southern Technology Center hosted numerous regional, state, and local conferences to develop cooperative, collaborative efforts to support small to medium manufacturers. Today these efforts appear to be bearing fruit.( Firm Connections, the newsletter of RTS, is available by writing P. O. Box 9005, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27514). <p> That technology transfer is catching on is evidenced through the high priority assigned to tech-prep programs within the Carl Perkins Vocational Education and Advanced Technology Act, as well as the existence of the National Coalition of Advanced Technology Centers, a group of some 72 community colleges interested in technology transfer. The National Coalition, an AACC-affiliated council, is administered by the Center for Occupational Research and Development( CORD), a nonprofit public service organization that assists educators and industry in addressing the training and retraining needs of workers. Many community college practitioners will be familiar with Don Hull, CORD 's president, as co-author of Tech Prep Associate Degree : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Parnell, 1991). Given the high cost associated with developing technology transfer programs, community college leaders should " look before leaping. " The Coalition publications, the Rosenfeld book, and the case study on The Bevill Center for Advanced Manufacturing at Gadsden State Community College in Katsinas and Lacey 's monograph( 1989) all deserve examination.( Information on the National Coalition and CORD may be obtained by writing P. O. Box 21689, Waco, TX 76702-1689.) Employment, Training, and Literacy Programs <p> The decade of the 1980s saw community colleges emerge as a major player in employment, training, and literacy programs. According to a 1989 study by NETWORK, a consortium of some 250 community colleges involved in training, literacy, and welfare-to-work programs based at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio, 71% of the 384 responding community colleges participated in federally-funded Job Training Partnership Act( JTPA) programs financed by local PICs( Visdos &; Malley, 1990, p. 2). The total dollar amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over $250,000,000 nationwide( p. 2). <p> A 1993 study sponsored by the Southport Insititute for Policy Analysis found that the larger the community college in terms of enrollment, the more likely they were to participate in workplace education programs( Dilcher, 1993). Dilcher found that 44% of the colleges with enrollments of 1,000 and under were involved in workplace education programs, as compared to 81% with enrollments of 8,000 and above( p. 6). Practitioners interested in seeking good advice on how to administer performance-based cotnracts, the funding method used in many JTPA and Job Opportunities Basic Skills programs are advised to consult the work of Spence and Oliver( 1989).( JOBS is the training component of Aid to Families with Dependent Children programs.) Practitioners interested in additional information related to program funding and implementation, effective curriculum, and professional staff development in employment, training, and adult literacy programs at community colleges should contact the AACC-affiliated NETWORK Consortium( Robert J. Visdos, President, NETWORK, Cuyahoga Community College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44115). <p> Zeiss( 1991) described collaborative programs to promote workplace literacy and provided practical guidance on how to develop effective workplace literacy programs and promote effective partnerships between community colleges and private sector entities. A companion work reports the results of a survey of large- and medium-sized businesses in a 13-state area as to what they needed and expected from community colleges in terms of training and literacy( Zeiss, 1989). With the full implementation of regulations at the state level under the Family Support Act of 1988, which specifically made postsecondary education an allowable activity for funding for the first time, a funding source to initiate more programs to serve the underclass has become available. This is likely to be an area of growing interest in the coming years, especially as states continue to reduce their funding of developmental education programs beyond the high school. For example, the state of Illinois assigned the responsiblity for administering the JOBS program to the Illinois Community College Board in July of 1993. Economic Impact Studies and Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by community colleges on economic development. Most of these institutional studies build upon models that take the total college payroll, as well as all services and goods directly purchased by the institution, and then apply an economic multiplier to approximate the economic contribution of the community college to the community. It is this author 's view that these studies tend to be of very limited value in that they tend not to assess the value added by the institution. The value added by the institution through the expanded earning potential of its graduates( by virtue of their being able to acquire and learn knowledge in an information age at ever faster rates) is much more difficult to assess. Yet, it is precisely this information that is valuable to institutions and their external publics. <p> One of the most interesting economic impact studies in the literature was performed by Pueblo Community College as discussed by Katsinas and Lacey( 1989). This study assessed the impact of its small business incubation program( the Myers Center for Small Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Pueblo Community College( 1985 to 1993), indicated that this information dramatically and positively improved the positioning of the institution among its external constituencies, particularly within the Colorado Legislature. Seybert developed an economic impact study of Johnson County Community College on the Kansas City metropolitan area, which includes a good, brief methodology section that would inform readers on how to conduct a similar study( 1991b) Seybert also performed a study of the economic impact of all of the higher education institutions in the Kansas City metropolitan area for the Kansas City Regional Council for Higher Education( 1991a). Conclusion <p> Many of the most valuable works in the economic development field are written by political scientists, economists, and sociologists and published in journals not regularly read by community college practitioners. Additionally, much of the research within community college publications consists of self-reported case studies, which sometimes border on anecdotal storytelling. Therefore, the most useful works are those that actually evaluate problems and barriers -- the practical problems associated with program replication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consensus regarding the proper economic development mission of urban community colleges among policymakers at both state and federal levels certainly applies to rural and suburban institutions as well. Given the federal budget deficits and the lack of funding for new, federally-financed programs, the locus of activity during the 1990s is likely to shift to the states. Effective community college practitioners must become informed about economic development beyond their own institutions and involved in policy formation at state and local levels. <p>
